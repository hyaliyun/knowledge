White served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, representing Hampshire County, and later served as a member of the Virginia State Senate, representing Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, and Morgan counties. He represented Virginia's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives during the 13th United States Congress. White also served as the sheriff of Hampshire County. White was the grandson of Virginia pioneer settler and physician Dr. Robert White (1688‚Äì1752); thus, he was a member of the prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia. He was the nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738‚Äì1804), and the brother of Virginia judge Robert White (1759‚Äì1831). Early life Francis White was born in 1761 at Hayfield, near Winchester in Frederick County, Colony of Virginia. White was the son of John White and his wife, Ann Patton White. Through his grandfather, Dr. Robert White (1688‚Äì1752), Francis White was of Scottish descent. His uncle was Alexander White (1738‚Äì1804), an inaugural member of the United States House of Representatives. White attended the common schools in Winchester. Following his education, White engaged in agricultural pursuits along the Cacapon and North rivers in Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia). By 1813, White was operating a gristmill and a sawmill on his Hampshire County property.  Political career =Virginia House of Delegates White was elected to represent the multi-member electoral district of Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates for three terms: 1794, 1809 to 1813, and 1818 to 1823. In his 1794 term, White served alongside Isaac Parsons; from 1809 to 1813, he served alongside Alexander King, from 1818 to 1823, White served alongside William Armstrong, Jr., Ephraim Dunn, and Edward McCarty. During the 1809 election for Hampshire County's two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates, White ran against fellow Federalist Alexander King, and Democratic-Republicans William Donaldson and Jonathan Pugh. King received the most votes at 312, and White came in second with 288 votes, thus qualifying him for a seat. White ran for reelection in 1811 against Alexander King, William Armstrong, and Jonathan Pugh. White and King received the two highest vote totals, with White receiving 313 votes. White was reelected to his seat in 1812, with 336 votes. Following his election along with Ephraim Dunn in 1821, White returned to the Virginia House of Delegates, representing Hampshire County. In the 1822 election, White ran for election against Ephraim Dunn and George Park, with Dunn and White winning Hampshire County's two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. White received the most votes, with 276. In 1795, while serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, White was either elected or appointed to serve as a justice of the peace in Hampshire County, along with Alexander King, William Vause, John Jack, Virgil McCrackin, and John Snyder. United States House of Representatives White was elected unopposed as a Federalist representing Virginia's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives during the 13th United States Congress (March 4, 1813 ‚Äì March 3, 1815). White's election in 1813 occurred during an ascendancy of the Federalist Party throughout Virginia. White served on the United States House Committee on the District of Columbia. According to GovTrack, from May 1813 to March 1815, White missed 56 of 352 roll call votes (15.9%). White resided at the Law's Ten Buildings boarding house of Mrs. Lane on New Jersey Avenue in Washington, D.C. during the May 24 ‚Äì August 2, 1813 session and the December 6, 1813 ‚Äì April 18, 1814 session. White ran for reelection in 1815, but he lost to fellow Federalist Magnus Tate with 420 votes (36.65 percent of the vote), while Tate had 726. Virginia State Senate Following his term in the United States House of Representative, White continued to operate his farms on the Cacapon and North rivers. In 1823, White was elected as a member of the Virginia State Senate, defeating opponent candidate Ignatius O'Ferrall. White held the seat until 1824. White's seat in the Virginia State Senate represented District 6, which consisted of Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, and Morgan counties. While serving in the Virginia State Senate, White was appointed sheriff of Hampshire County on December 9, 1823, by Virginia Governor James Pleasants. On Thursday, January 1, 1824, White informed the Virginia State Senate of his appointment to the position of Hampshire County sheriff, and he asked for an opinion as to whether he could retain his senate seat while serving as sheriff. White's inquiry was referred to the senate's Committee of Privileges and Elections for \\"consideration and a report of their opinion thereupon to the House.\\" The following day, on Friday, January 2, 1824, the Committee of Privileges and Elections delivered their opinion: White should vacate his senate seat upon his acceptance of the position of Hampshire County sheriff, and the sheriffs of the senate district's four counties were directed to hold a special election to \\"supply the vacancy occasioned.\\" On Tuesday, February 3, 1824, the Virginia State Senate certified the election of Elisha Boyd to fill White's senate seat.  Later life and death  White continued to serve as Hampshire County's sheriff until his death. White died on October 6, 1826, at his residence on the Cacapon River in Hampshire County. He was interred at the White Family Graveyard at Hayfield in Frederick County, Virginia. Personal life and family White married his first cousin, Margaret White, in Frederick County on December 5, 1787. Margaret White was the daughter of White's uncle, Robert White II. White and his wife had at large family, with at least six children: * Robert Norvell White, married Matilda McBride, daughter of John McBride * Thomas B. White * John A. White * Francis White, Jr. (1799 ‚Äì September 8, 1868) * Unnamed daughter, married to a Mr. Keyes * Mary M. White McDonald (1811 ‚Äì February 7, 1839), married Evan McDonald, son of Benjamin and Margaret Hiett McDonald Land ownership White amassed extensive landholdings in Hampshire County. In 1797, White purchased along the North River in Hampshire County from Henry and Rachael Pierce of Cecil County, Maryland. White purchased an additional along the North River in 1800. At the time of his election to the United States House of Representatives, White was a resident of Romney.

Within this broad arena, Zimbabwe has several identifiable categories of art. It is a hallmark of African cultures in general that art touches many aspects of life, and most tribes have a vigorous and often recognisable canon of styles and a great range of art-worked objects. These can include masks, drums, textile decoration, beadwork, carving, sculpture, ceramic in various forms, housing and the person themselves. Decoration of the body in permanent ways such as scarification or tattoo or impermanently as in painting the body for a ceremony is a common feature of African cultures. Spoken or musical art is also a prominent part of Africas generally. Various instruments including drums, lamellophones and stringed bows have been used in Zimbabwe, while oratory, poetry, fable telling, praise singing and tribal ritual chants are also prominent. In recent decades Zimbabwe has become widely recognized internationally for its sculpture. History It is useful to examine Zimbabwean art through time, by area, by main tribal division and as indicative of recent historic and political changes. There is an artistic tradition in Zimbabwe that can be traced back to pottery of the Early and Late Stone Age and rock paintings from the Late Stone Age.Winter-Irving C. (1991) \\"Visual Culture in Early History\\", Chapter 8 in \\"Stone Sculpture in Zimbabwe\\", Roblaw Publishers, Harare, Many rock paintings produced by San artists between 10000 and 2000 years ago are found in cultural sites in Zimbabwe Garlake P S. (1993) \\"Painted Caves: Prehistoric Art in Zimbabwe\\", Modus Publications Pvt. Ltd, and these demonstrate a high degree of skill in drawing. Many depict recognisable animal figures and use shading and colour to enhance the visual impact. The archaeology of Zimbabwe includes numerous pottery finds, which assist in the reconstruction of linguistic and cultural groupings within what is here termed Shona.Beach D N. (1980) \\"Shona and Zimbabwe 900-1850: An Outline of Shona History\\", Heinemann, The pottery indicates that the people of the Late Iron Age were settled agriculturists and they have been categorised as forming groups such as the Harare culture and the Leopard‚Äôs Kopje culture: the latter established in 980 AD in a site called K2.Huffman T. (1986) \\"Iron Age Settlements and Origins of Class Distinction in Southern Africa\\", Advances in World Archaeology, vol. 5, pp.291-338 This group moved to Mapungubwe where they used stone walls to separate the ruling class from the rest of the population. This settlement was abandoned in the thirteenth century at around the time that a now much better-known site was developed by others who lived on the Zimbabwean plateau. This was Great Zimbabwe, which dates from about 1250‚Äì1500 AD. It is a stone-walled town (Zimbabwe means \\"royal residence\\") and shows evidence in its archaeology of skilled stone working: the walls were made of a local granite and no mortar was used in their construction.Needham D.E., Mashingaidze E.K, Bhebe N. (1984) \\"From Iron Age to Independence, A History of Central Africa\\", p17. Longman, England. When excavated, six soapstone birds and a soapstone bowl were found in the eastern enclosure of the monument, so these Shona-speaking Gumanye people certainly produced sculpture. Each object was carved from a single piece of stone and the birds have an aesthetic quality that places them as genuine \\"art\\". In comparing them to other better-known African stone sculpture, for example from the Yoruba culture, Philip Allison, writing in 1968, stated \\"The stone sculptures of Rhodesia are few in number and of no great aesthetic distinction, but Zimbabwe itself has a place of peculiar importance in the study of African cultures\\".Allison P., (1968) \\"African Stone Sculpture\\", p54. Lund Humphries, Great Britain Stone Age In prehistory the area was widely settled by Kung peoples, the so-called Khoikhoi or San, Hottentot or Bushmen people, who were hunter gatherers. They often lived in caves and made various artworks, including beading from shells for personal decoration, incising designs on ostrich shells and utilitarian objects such as clay water straws and also on the cave walls themselves. These dynamic and varied cave paintings date from around 10000 BCE and depict humans hunting many kinds of animals, warfare between humans, mystical and other unidentified marks, landscape and ceremonies where the humans are obviously decorated or in costume. The colours vary from black through brown, red, ochre, yellow and white. The pigments used are unknown, though presumably contain a mix of local materials such as earth oxides, fat, vegetable juices and possibly fluids from larval insects. Certainly they have lasted for thousands of years. Their descendants, who live mainly in Botswana and Namibia, sing a variety of uniquely structured and tuneful songs, accompanied sometimes by a plucked or struck bow. They also have a repertoire of dances, and there is no reason to suspect their ancestors did not do the same thing. Iron Age These Stone Age people were supplanted by Iron Age Nguni-derived pastoral and farming peoples migrating in from the east and north around 2000 years ago, who became the ancestors of the WaRozwi/Barotse people and by derivation the Amashona peoples. The art of these people can be seen in many decorated first-fired clay pots, where typically a repeated dhlo-dhlo (linear herringbone) motif or similar edging was applied. Other artwork is harder to source, though it can assumed they decorated the body and had beadwork and other art styles related to typical styles of the East and Central African Nguni peoples. A recurrent motif in Shona art is the transformation of a human into an animal of some kind. Later prehistory At around the same time as the earlier incursions of these Bantu-type people (200BCE) there were sporadic expeditions by South- East coastal dwellers, probably by the Save River or over mountain passes in the Eastern Highlands, into the Zimbabwe area to obtain gold for trade with Arab traders trading as far south as the mouth of the Savi. They built stone forts extending into the interior at one day's march from each other, with the final one being the complex now known as Great Zimbabwe. To service the coastal trade a town called Sofala was established at the mouth of the Sofala river on the east coast. It had its heydey in around 700 AD/CE and served the Mwenemutapa/Monomotapa Kingdom, whose capital was Great Zimbabwe. Arabs took up residence in Sofala around 900AD/CE. Early sculpture Archaeology at Zimbabwe has shown several distinct phases of building and styles of stonework. It is likely the original complex was rather functional - essentially a fort and trading post only, and the later and more elaborate building occurred when the complex became the central administrative and royal centre of activity for the area. Some of the architectural features are probably linked with styles of coastal Swahili architecture and some are uniquely local. Chinese pottery shards, ivory, glass objects, local gold objects, Arabic and local beads, copper ingots, iron ingots and other trade items have been found at Zimbabwe. The herringbone and other stepped linear forms of decoration in the walls are a feature of the most recent stonework. Similar stonework is seen at Khami ruins, a fort built on the way to Zimbabwe. However, the most impressive and unique feature of Zimbabwe are the huge soapstone birds, the so-called Zimbabwe birds, depicting a bird of prey perched on a zig-zag base motif. These birds are possibly based on the bateleur eagle or maybe a vulture species and might have had something to do with a religious cult or indicative of a totem animal for the ruling people at the time. Most of these sculptures are still in the country but one is in South Africa where it still adorns Groote Schuur an official residence, once the home of Cecil Rhodes. Another unexplained motif at Zimbabwe, which like the birds were mounted on the perimeter wall of the Great Enclosure, were stelae or tall narrow rectilinear pillars of rock (probably natural fracture artefacts) set at intervals round the top of the wall. The Zimbabwe bird is the most prominent motif of the current Zimbabwe flag. Amandebele incursions The origin of Amandebele speaking peoples in southern Zimbabwe received its main impetus from settlement around 1840 under Mzilikazi, a Khumalo chief who rebelled against Zulu rule. However, it is likely that such tribes began crossing the Limpopo sporadically from about 1800 onwards. Amandebele conflict with the Amashona drove them northwards into what was dubbed in colonial times Mashonaland. These Amandebele/Matabele peoples had several distinct art forms differing from the Amashona: in pottery styles, bead aprons and headpieces, house decoration, carving and decoration of war implements such as clubs/knobkierries and shields. 19th and early 20th century Art in Zimbabwe lost most of its spiritual power with the conversion of the majority of the population to Christianity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Missionaries harmed the local cultures by demanding destruction of anything they regarded as anti-Christian, in particular masks or carvings thought to have votive powers, that is, to be appealing to some god that was not the Christian one. By the second world war most art objects produced in Zimbabwe were simply that: produced for tourist and local white settler consumption. With the advent of guns, animal skins prepared and decorated with small panels of other hides also began to appear more frequently in the early 20th century, as well as 'karosses' or fur blankets influenced by BaTchwana styles from Botswana to the south. As for travelers to the area during the Victorian period, they used art, especially painting, to depict some of what they saw there. This art of the colonial period took landscape as its main theme and many of the European artists were present as part of expeditions that aimed to inform the public in Europe about life in Africa. For example, Thomas Baines joined the Zambezi expedition led by David Livingstone in 1858 and in 1861 he was one of the first to make oil paintings of Victoria Falls. John Guille Millais spent six months of 1893 sketching and hunting in Zimbabwe.Winter-Irving C. (1991) \\"Visual Arts since the Nineteenth Century\\", Chapter 9 in \\"Stone Sculpture in Zimbabwe\\", Roblaw Publishers, Harare, In the 1940s a Zimbabwe philanthropist named Jairos Jiri began to teach disabled people various artistic skills and centralised their production for sale in several outlets nationwide. These proved very popular and returned money to persons otherwise excluded from normal commercial activity. Jairos Jiri centres remain an important part of the artistic output in Zimbabwe. Typical items include tiles, tiled tables and wall plaques, basketwork, beading, carvings in wood and stone, jewellery and paintings. Prelude to independence In the mid-1970s the nationalist guerilla incursions resulted in several atrocities against people in rural villages, including the sawing off of the upper lip of those perceived as collaborating with the government forces. The white government collated photographic images and a text list of these events into a propaganda booklet called 'Anatomy of Terror'. This was designed to show the brutality of the nationalists against innocent rural native people. Images from this publication are today to be found on YouTube (for example under 'Terrorists in the Rhodesian bush'). Other art from the white minority during the civil \\"Rhodesian Bush\\" (1968 - 1979) war consisted mainly of depictions of indigenous fauna and flora and landscapes. These subjects had always been popular and remain popular to this day among white artists. No individual white artist expressed any significant political sentiment during the civil war era. However, many film, still and sound clips celebrating the government forces' role during this time are currently available on YouTube. Painting in the 20th century While there were many well-known white artists in Rhodesia prior to independence in 1980, there were relatively few black artists of note. One of these was Kingsley Sambo (1932‚Äì1977), who started to paint at the Cyrene Mission where Canon Edward Paterson taught art. Two of Sambo‚Äôs paintings are in the MoMA. Other artists, who were also leading sculptors, were Thomas Mukarobgwa and Joseph Ndandarika who had studied with John Groeber at the Serima Mission Church. Although the Workshop School of the National Gallery supported and encouraged painters from 1957, Rhodesia had few Colleges for Fine Arts. The Bulawayo College of Fine Art and Design trained artists in fine art and graphic design for Rhodesian industry and it was not until 1963 that Alex Lambert set up the Mzilikazi Art School in Bulawayo specifically to encourage local people to take up art. The National Gallery has, since 1986, promoted local artists by hosting an annual exhibition of contemporary visual arts called \\"Zimbabwe Heritage\\". Patronage from Zimbabwean companies ‚Äì the Baringa Corporation (for paintings, graphics, textiles, ceramics and photograph) and the Nedlaw Investment and Trust Corporation (for sculpture) ‚Äì initially supported the expense of having an international panel of judges come to Zimbabwe to assess the works and make Awards. Later, the sponsorship of the event grew to include international companies such as Mobil, Lever Brothers, The BOC Group and Longman. Early winners of Awards of Distinction in the painters and graphics category included Berry Bickle (1987), Bert Hemsteede (1988), Rashid Jogee (1992) and Tichaona Madzamba (1992).See annual catalogues for Zimbabwe Heritage, produced by the National Gallery Painters who have established reputations in post- independence Zimbabwe include Dumisani Ngwenya, Taylor Nkomo and Richard Jack. Sculpture in the 20th and 21st centuries Zimbabwe Sculpture: a Tradition in Stone, Atlanta, United States, at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport between concourses T and A Since antiquity local artists have been using the steatite/soapstone deposits of the eastern Zimbabwe mountain ranges to produce artworks showing, among other things, the common Shona theme of animal/human inter-morphosis. These works became much larger under the patronage of white collectors in the 1960s (though the Zimbabwe birds of antiquity are massive) and now it is common to see monumental sculptures in hard Serpentine stone both nationally and internationally. Chapungu Sculpture Park in Harare is currently an important locality for display of (mainly) Shona sculptors and carvers. Another Chapungu Sculpture Park was created in 2007 in the United States, along with a gallery, in Loveland, Colorado. Zimbabwe Sculpture: a Tradition in Stone is on permanent display at Atlanta's airport. Noted contemporary artists include sculptors Dominic Benhura and Tapfuma Gutsa, and painters Kingsley Sambo and Owen Maseko. Villa Mangiacane in Tuscany hosts one of the largest modern collections of Shona Art sculptures in Europe with over 220 pieces on display across its grounds. AVAC Arts now supports the adaptation and utilization of new technologies in sculpture and runs an online portal facilitating its international trade.

He is notable for his comic strips Jitterati and Brunswick, whose characters have been reproduced in many forms of cultural activities including newspapers, murals, short films, and theatre productions.  Biography  Grant Buist was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1973. He is a graduate of Victoria University of Wellington's Theatre and Film Department; he also studied graphic design at Massey University. He is currently living on the Kapiti Coast.  Jitterati  Buist writes the comic strip Jitterati (a satire on latte-sipping cafe values along with contemporary political and social developments in Wellington and beyond) which was published in the weekly Wellington City newspaper The Capital Times until it closed in April 2013. Jitterati hit the 500th episode in May 2012. A compilation book of Jitterati strips was published in 2009.Dylan Horrocks, pages 18-19 \\"New Zealand Comics and Graphic Novels\\", From July 2013 the cartoon series began appearing in the monthly Wellington magazine FishHead, which closed in 2016. Jitterati was then published online, by Scoop until April 2017, and subsequently on Buist's Twitter account.  Brunswick  Buist also produced the cult New Zealand alt-comic strip Brunswick from 1993 to 2003. By the time that it ended, Brunswick was appearing in almost all New Zealand student newspapers, including Salient and Craccum, giving the strip the widest national distribution that a New Zealand underground comix had ever received. In celebration of Brunswick, Victoria University of Wellington erected a Brunswick Mural, and the walls of one of the library lifts was covered in a Brunswick collage. In 2006, Brunswick was turned into a series of short films for the Wellington information kiosks. In 2007 BATS Theatre staged Brunswick- based musical Fitz Bunny: Lust for Glory (FB:L4G), which set a box office record for the 2007 Young & Hungry festival, BATS Theatre's celebration of young talent.Dominion Post, 18 June 2007The Lumiere Reader, 16 June 2007 An updated and refocused version of the satirical play was produced in Auckland in 2010, which was considered one of the top five plays of the year by national newspaper The New Zealand Herald. Herald critic Paul Simei-Barton said about the 2010 production \\"Fitz Bunny: Lust for Glory is in a league of its own and invents a new genre that might be called camp cartoon cabaret. Playwright and cartoonist Grant Buist presents a fully fledged musical complete with live band, great songs and wild dance routines.\\" Buist has written a version of the show for schools, which was performed at Tokomairiro High School in July 2018.  Other activities  In 2007 he was the graphic designer for Salient. He has also animated music videos for cult New Zealand bands The Shirleys and OdESSA. In the short time, between 2008 and 2010, Grant established an account on Pixton where he created a three-panel comic entitled Desert Funnies. The comic series, about two friendly cacti in the desert, relied on visual gags and humor that ranged from light to almost metaphorical and poetic standards. The series reached 211 issues. Buist has also participated in several art exhibitions.

Karl Stoerk (German: St√∂rk, 17 September 1832 - 13 September 1899) was an Austrian laryngologist who was a native of Ofen. He studied medicine at the Universities of Prague and Vienna, and received his doctorate in 1858. Afterwards he was an assistant to Ludwig T√ºrck (1810‚Äì1868) in Vienna, where he practiced medicine for the remainder of his career. In 1891 Stoerk was appointed head of the laryngological clinic. Along with Leopold von Schr√∂tter (1837‚Äì1908) and Johann Schnitzler (1835‚Äì1893), Stoerk was a catalyst in making Vienna a major center of laryngological research in the late 19th century. He demonstrated the possibility of applying remedies into the larynx and throat assisted by a laryngoscope. He also devised several medical instruments, including an early esophagoscope that was modification of the \\"Waldenburg esophagoscope\\".

It is used as a component part of amphibious, airborne and amphibious-airborne operations, alone or in coordination with formations and units of the Army in order to capture parts of the seashore, islands, ports, fleet bases, coast airfields and other coast objects from the enemy. It can also be used to defend naval bases, vital shoreline areas, separate islands and coast objects, and security of hostile areas.Structure of Ukrainian Armed Forces Mission The Naval Infantry's missions are to: * Act independently during attacks on enemy's naval installations, ports, islands and coastal areas * Clear the enemy's coastal areas & provide security during the landing of the main forces.\\"–í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏\\" Its motto is –í—ñ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∑–∞–≤–∂–¥–∏!

Hetmanate A Ukrainian Naval Infantry BTR-80 takes part in Exercise Sea Breeze 2010. Former Russian Imperial army general Pavlo Skoropadskyi understood the importance of naval infantry in providing security to the country. Being the commander-in-chief of land and naval forces, Skoropadskyi brought attention to creating the naval infantry during his first month in power. On May 23, 1918 he ordered the Department of Navy to Begin forming a Brigade of naval infantry consisting of three regiments.–ú–æ—Ä—Å—å–∫–∞ –î–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ :: –ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–æ—Äi–Ω–∫–∞ - –ê–Ω–æ–Ω—Å–∏ The mission of the Naval Infantry was protecting coastal areas, serving as a garrison force for forts and conducting landing operations. According to the order the Brigade was divided into three regiments. First regiment was responsible for the areas between the western border until the village of Suchavka, near Odesa. Second regiment was responsible for territory between Suchavka and Stanislavov. Third regiment protected the areas from Stanislavov until Perekop. Brigade was also put in charge of guarding the property of the Navy Department. Each of the three regiments consisted of three kurins. Each kurin consisted of three Sotnia and a machine gun unit. Commandant of the first regiment was Ilarion Isaievych. On August 31, 1918 each unit was given the permanent headquarters. First regiment's HQ was located in Odesa, second's HQ in Mykolaiv and third's HQ in Kherson. Also at this time 3 squadrons of cavalry were formed. First was stationed in Odesa, second in Ochakiv and third in Perekop. In October 1918 new recruits born in 1899, would have joined the ranks of the naval infantry, however due to the political situation of that autumn the recruits had to wait until a better time. Not long after, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was removed from power in an uprising led by Symon Petliura. The Naval Infantry continued to faithfully serve their nation under the banner of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Many of them have died for freedom and independence. Modern history A Ukrainian naval infantryman armed with a Dragunov sniper rifle takes part in Exercise Northern Light '03 on the west coast of Scotland. On February 22, 1993, the 880th Separate Naval Infantry Battalion of the Black Sea Fleet commanded by Major Vitaliy G.

On September 1, 1993, the 41st Separate Naval Infantry Battalion was formed. By September 20, 1994, the 4th Naval Infantry Brigade was stationed in the Tylove village of Crimea. From May 1996 until 1998, the Brigade was a part of the Ukrainian National Guard. In 1998, it was transferred to the Navy and re-designated the 1st Separate Naval Infantry Brigade. In 1999, the Brigade consisted of two battalions numbering 1,500 marines.Microsoft Word - Neutrality-UA_m.doc During 2003‚Äì04, the Ukrainian armed forces underwent a program to reduce the number of brigades, and the Naval Infantry Brigade was reduced to a Battalion. Ukrainian marines and US marines simulating casualty extraction using a Mi-8 during the multinational Sea Breeze exercise in 2011.The command of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine made a decision to form a new naval infantry battalion by force of a mechanised battalion located in Kerch. In December 2013 the militaries of the new 501st Separate Naval Infantry Battalion have taken the Naval Infantry Oath. The 1st Separate Naval Infantry Battalion was under the jurisdiction of the 36th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade, and it was stationed in Feodosiya and there was also another one battalion (501st Bn.) which was stationed in Kerch; both were in the Crimea until late March 2014. After the Russian annexation of the Crimea the battalions were deployed to another location out of the peninsula. After the annexation of Crimea Ukraine's marine forces composed of only about 200 active duty personnel. Special reconnaissance units of the marine corps were deployed against insurgents during the 2014 War in Donbass. Oleksandr Zinchenko of the 73rd marine spetsnaz detachment was the first Ukrainian Marine killed during the War in Donbass. The Ukrainian Marine Corps was particularly hard hit by the Crimea Crisis as all of their forces except for the 73rd spetsnaz detachment were stationed on the peninsula, due to this the unit had to undergo extensive reorganization before being able to be deployed to the war in the Donbass. In September 2014 Ministry of Defense announced that the marine corps were reforming from the Crimea Crisis and the remaining members of the 1st Marine Battalion which was stationed in Feodosya would take an active part in the War in Donbass. On 29 October 2014 Ukraine's Marine Corps conventional forces, recently recovered from the Crimea Crisis suffered their first casualty near Mariupol, the Marine was a Major and was killed when his unit's position came under Russian artillery fire. On 8 November 2014 Ukrainian marines returned to their permanent place of deployment in Mykolaiv as part of a regular rotation of Ukrainian forces during the War in Donbass. On 23 May 2018, the NI celebrated the first Marine Corps Birthday celebrations, the holiday being officially sanctioned by no less than President Petro Poroshenko as part of a nationalization of the former Soviet holidays, replacing those with the ones celebrating Ukrainian military history, the holiday marking the formation of the first marine units in May 1918, during the Ukrainian War of Independence. New colours were awarded incorporating the speciality badge awarded to the unit in 2007, and the NI was transformed into the Fleet Marine Division with 2 brigades and an independent brigade of marine artillery, while the former black berets were changed to light green following the practice of the British Royal Marines and the Italian Army Lagunari. The new colours include the blue cross from the naval ensign as an acknowledgement of its role as a constituent service of the Navy. Plans are underway for the formation of a 3rd Marine brigade, bringing the total number of brigades to four plus one MRL regiment, with an option for a fourth brigade. If the expansion continues it can be possible that the Naval Infantry Corps will be elevated to a full Corps-sized formation within the Navy, becoming the largest ever marine unit in Eastern Europe outside of Russia and with possible accession to NATO, the largest marine component within its European member armed forces. Reform The ideal goal in the reform of the Naval Infantry Corps is to form a unit which would be similar to the units sent to Iraq. It is planned that there will be no more conscripts in the Naval Infantry, only professional naval infantrymen under contract service.–ú—ñ–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ - –ù–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∏ Organization=1918 structure *1st Regiment - Odessa **1st Kurin ***1st Sotnia ***2nd Sotnia ***3rd Sotnia ***machine gun unit **2nd Kurin **3rd Kurin *2nd Regiment - Mykolaiv *3rd Regiment - Kherson *1st Cavalry Squadron - Odesa *2nd Cavalry Squadron - Ochakiv *3rd Cavalry Squadron - Perekop 1998 structure *Corps HQ *1st Air Assault Battalion \\"Lion\\" *2nd Air Assault Battalion \\"Berkut\\" *1st Air Assault Reconnaissance Battalion \\"Sword\\" *Separate Combat Engineer Battalion \\"Crab\\" *Separate Signal Company *1st Anti-Tank Battalion *1st Anti- Aircraft Artillery Battalion *1st Marine Artillery Battalion *2nd Marine Artillery Battalion Fleet Naval Infantry Division Ukrainian marines practicing urban warfare during the Rapid Trident 2014 exercise on 23 September 2014.

Weiss and David Zucker, and starring Drake Bell, Sara Paxton, Christopher McDonald, and Leslie Nielsen. It was originally titled Superhero! as a nod to one of the Zuckers' previous films, Airplane!, in which Nielsen also starred. A spoof of the superhero film genre, primarily Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, as well as other modern-day comic book film adaptations, the film follows in the footsteps of the Scary Movie series of comedies, with which the film's poster shares a resemblance. It was also inspired by, and contains homages to, some of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's earlier spoof films such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun. Production began on September 17, 2007, in Los Angeles. It was released on March 28, 2008 in the United States to generally negative reviews from critics (but more positive than earlier entries such as Date Movie and Meet the Spartans), but received a moderate box office success, grossing over $71 million worldwide. Plot Rick Riker (Drake Bell) is an unpopular student at Empire High School. He lives with his Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielsen) and Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross), and his best friend, Trey (Kevin Hart), is also his confidante. Rick has a crush on Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), but she is dating bully Lance Landers (Ryan Hansen). One day, Rick and his class go on a school field trip at an animal research lab run by terminally ill businessman Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald), who is Lance's uncle. During the trip, Rick accidentally saturates himself in animal-attraction liquid, which causes a group of animals to hump him. This also leads a chemically enhanced radioactive dragonfly to fly onto Rick's neck and bite him. Meanwhile, Lou creates a machine designed to heal illness; testing it on himself, he gains perfect health at the cost of needing to drain life energy from a victim per day. To avoid arrest for murder, Lou becomes the villain Hourglass. During a science fair, Rick begins to experience strange physical traits which creates a number of mishaps, and later realizes that he has developed superpowers from the dragonfly bite. Rick reveals his secret to his uncle and Trey, and an argument starts between him and Albert. The next day, while visiting the bank with Lucille, Rick accidentally allows a bank robber to make off with stolen cash. The robber then shoots and injures Albert. Rick is later met by Xavier (Tracy Morgan) who takes Rick to his school for mutants, where he meets Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, Invisible Woman, Barry Bonds and Mrs. Xavier, who convince Rick to become a superhero. At home, Rick creates a superhero costume and dubs himself Dragonfly. As Dragonfly, Rick starts watching over the city and fighting crime, quickly becoming a media sensation, despite being unable to fly. Later, Dragonfly attempts to stop Hourglass from robbing a warehouse full of \\"ceryllium\\" as part of his evil plan but fails, allowing Hourglass to escape. Later that night, Jill is attacked by thieves, but Dragonfly saves her and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Landers plans to construct a machine that will kill people and give him enough life energy to make him immortal. Later that night, Landers and Lance have dinner with Rick's family and Jill, but Landers secretly learns of Rick's true identity when he notices the same injuries on Rick as on Dragonfly. Making up an awkward excuse, he and Lance leave. Landers returns minutes later as Hourglass and kills Aunt Lucille. Albert awakens from his coma, learning about her death indirectly from his moronic doctor. After a comic funeral, Jill meets Rick and offers to begin a relationship with him. However, Rick fears Hourglass will come for Jill if they were together, and therefore rejects Jill, leaving her hurt and furious. Rick decides to end his superhero career, but knowing that Hourglass would head to an awards ceremony to kill hundreds of people, he gets Albert to take him there. At the ceremony, Rick is tricked by Landers into mistaking the Dalai Lama for Hourglass, and chaos ensues. Meanwhile, Jill discovers that Landers is Hourglass. When Hourglass clashes with Dragonfly on a rooftop, he tries to activate his machine, but Dragonfly manages to kill him with a bomb that had been comically stuck onto his genitals after being thrown by Hourglass. Jill is thrown off the side of the building by the explosion, but Dragonfly manages to grow wings and save her. Jill learns that Rick is Dragonfly due to a family ring he wears being exposed through a hole in his glove and the two begin a relationship. After being thanked for saving the city, Rick flies away with Jill, but the two are unexpectedly rammed by a passing helicopter.

Zucker said the film primarily parodied Spider-Man and Batman Begins, but it also spoofed X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Superman.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 52 reviews with an average rating of 3.6/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale.

However, the film also features some spoofs of X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, and some members of both teams are featured in the film. The film also makes references to other films such as when Rick Riker and Trey are in a bus and Trey is pointing out the different groups of cliques, this parodies the Mean Girls scene where Janis explains to Cady the cliques. One of the cliques is \\"Frodos\\" - kids dressed up as Hobbits looking similar to Frodo, The Lord of the Rings character. The film also makes fun of certain celebrities and their real-life actions such as Tom Cruise's Scientology video and Barry Bonds' alleged use of steroids. It also makes fun of British scientist Stephen Hawking.

It follows the adventures of Duca (Darlan Cunha) and his two friends after his uncle, Eder (L√°zaro Ramos), shows up and confesses to his family of having shot a man. However, the 15-year-old Duca suspects that his uncle's story about killing his lover's ex-husband in self-defense is not entirely truthful and so sets out to solve the mystery.http://www.interfilmes.com/filme_14941_meu.tio.matou.um.cara.html Plot After Eder shows up and confesses to what he has done, Duca's father (A√≠lton Gra√ßa) calls his lawyer friend to help Eder prepare his defense. Duca then goes to his long-time friend Isa's house, whom he secretly has feelings for, to tell her about the excitement. Soon after, his other friend Kid (Renan Augusto) arrives as well, and they explain the story to him as well. Duca sees Kid touch Isa's shoulder, though, and becomes jealous so he decides to return home.http://www.adorocinema.com/filmes/filme-108954/ The following day, Duca talks with Isa (Sophia Reis) again, and his skill for detective work by spotting flaws in her story that she did not spend much time with Kid after Duca left; he does not mention this to her, though, and finds out the truth from Kid later while they are shopping for CDs. As the story develops, Duca continues to try to subtly keep Isa and Kid from getting together due to Isa's obvious attraction to Kid, while simultaneously looking into the murder. To this end, Duca asks permission to visit Eder in jail. Isa eagerly volunteers to go along on the adventure, and they set out the following day. When they meet Eder, he asks Duca to give a message to his lover. Eder asks Duca to tell her not to visit him while he is in jail, and to tell her that he is fine. On the way back, Isa remembers the Pok√©mon pen that was confiscated from her and they return to the jail to retrieve it. Since they took the bus through a dangerous part of town, they are forced to walk the distance. The two encounter a group of men who aggressively hit on Isa, causing her to run away. The next day at school, she brags about her adventure, embellishing the details greatly to her friends. Duca remains silent, but when pressed for details himself, he disagrees with Isa, and she storms away angrily. Attempting to get past the incident, he pretends it never happened, to the annoyance of Isa. Kid, however, is eager to have an adventure of his own and so agrees to travel to Eder's girlfriend's condo and relay the message. After locating Eder's Lover, Soraya (Deborah Secco), they are permitted up by the doorman. She answers her door scantily clad, and invites the boys in. They relay the message, to her general disinterest, and she requests that Duca repair her automatic pool cleaning device - a product of Eder's that failed to sell well. Out by her pool, Duca notices several items which lead him to believe another man is living with Soraya. Moving inside, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees a tattooed male arm answering a phone downstairs. While leaving, they accidentally track soil from a broken vase over the carpet downstairs to the fury of the doorman. They flee, giving Kid something to brag about at school the next day as well. Duca again visits his uncle, and this time asks him more questions. He decides that Eder is lying about his involvement and is covering for Soraya, who Duca believes is the true killer. Duca believes that his uncle is taking the fall for a woman who is being unfaithful to Eder and may be simply using Eder. He believes that Eder would never take Duca's word for it about the man living with Soraya, and so he goes about hiring a private investigator to obtain photographic evidence. Meanwhile, during the investigation, Duca is worried that an upcoming party will lead to Isa and Kid getting together at last, so he craftily plays matchmaker with Kid and another classmate. However, upon seeing how unhappy Isa becomes after watching the two dance, Duca helps to repair the situation and leaves the party with his two friends dancing closely together. When the investigator shows the photographs, Duca is surprised to find it showing Kid back at Soraya's condo. The series of pictures seems to suggest that the two had sex, and when Isa asks to see the photographs, Duca refuses to show them, causing yet another fight between the two friends. Duca mails the photographs to Eder, hoping it will convince him to tell the truth to the police, and he remains not on speaking terms with his two friends for nearly a week. Isa, hoping to make up, comes to his house and has lunch with Duca and his family. Eder shows up, having obtained Habeas corpus pending his trial. He has not yet opened the package containing the photographs Duca sent him, and becomes furious upon seeing them. He rushes from the house intent on killing both his girlfriend and her new lover. Isa also sees the pictures as well and is also crushed. Duca convinces her that they must go to Soraya's condo, though, to try to stop Eder from doing something foolish. Eder, meanwhile, attacks the man living with his girlfriend and discovers that it is Fabio, Soraya's brother. The man in the pictures, however, is Kid (although the two do resemble each other). Soraya explains the series of photographs with an innocent story; but Duca can see that she is lying. As usual, though, he does not mention it to anyone. Eder and his girlfriend make up, and Duca decides to keep Soraya's secret seeing Eder so happy. Isa and Kid also break up, though Kid tells Duca privately that he had misread the situation and never had sex with Soraya. Isa informs Duca that she and Kid broke up, to which Duca offers condolences. Isa asks him if that is really how he feels and Duca admits that he is happy they are no longer together. The film ends with the two friends kissing and Eder's fate still unknown.

Van Cise (October 25, 1884 - December 8, 1969), was a U.S. Army colonel, crimebusting district attorney, and private practice lawyer in Denver, Colorado. He is best known for arresting and prosecuting the notorious \\"Million-Dollar Bunco Ring\\" headed by Lou Blonger, a story he recounted in his book Fighting the Underworld. Early life Philip Van Cise was born in Deadwood, South Dakota and moved to Denver at the age of 16. He graduated from the University of Colorado in 1907, and received his law degree two years later. From 1910 to 1914, he was a member of the Colorado National Guard, where he attained the rank of captain. During World War I he served as an intelligence officer in France and remained in the Officer Reserve Corps as a Lieutenant colonel until 1942. District attorney Van Cise took advantage of a split in the Denver's Republican Party to win the Republican primary and the office of district attorney in 1921. He immediately set out to clean up the con men who preyed on Colorado's summer tourist trade. The gang was well connected with politicians at all levels, but had no control over Van Cise, who was not beholden to the political power structure. At the same time, Van Cise received little backing in his effort from either the mayor, Dewey C. Bailey, or law enforcement officials, many of whom, it would later be shown, were in league with the con men. In 1922, Van Cise set up an independent investigation of the Blonger gang, secretly funded by a group of wealthy Denver citizens and employing a handful of former federal agents and others. On August 24 of that year, Van Cise used a special force of Colorado Rangers to capture 33 suspects in a single day. Fearing that Denver police would tip off the gang once the first suspect was taken to jail, Van Cise detained the gang members in the basement of the First Universalist Church, where he was a member, until the sweep was complete. In Colorado's longest and most expensive trial to that time, 20 con men, including Lou Blonger, were convicted and sent to prison, effectively busting the \\"Million-Dollar Bunco Ring.\\" Van Cise also waged battle against the Ku Klux Klan during his four-year term in office. His life was threatened, crosses were burned in his yard, and one attempt was made to kidnap him. Van Cise refused the call of many citizens to run for mayor to replace Bailey in 1923 and returned to private practice in 1925. Private attorney Returning to private life, Van Cise formed a law partnership with his former assistant district attorney, Kenneth Robinson. In 1936, he wrote and published his memoir of the gang-busting saga, Fighting the Underworld, which became an influential book in criminology circles. Drama followed Van Cise into private life. For more than 20 years, he served as an attorney for the Rocky Mountain News, and during this time aggressively defended the paper when it was sued for libel by Fred Bonfils, publisher of The Denver Post. Bonfils died before the case was tried. In 1943, two men tried to kidnap Van Cise from his front yard. Then, in 1945, the husband of a woman Van Cise represented in a divorce took two shots at him in his law office, to no effect. Retirement and death Van Cise retired from practice in 1967 and died in Denver's St. Luke's Hospital on December 8, 1969, after a month-long illness.

YMS-164 was laid down on 24 April 1942 at Benton Harbor, Michigan, by the Dachel-Carter Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 28 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Anna Arny; and commissioned on 14 April 1943, with Lt. (jg.) Robert W. Cumming, USNR, in command.  Operational history  During the first 15 months of her active service, the motor minesweeper operated along the east coast of the United States. In July 1944, she voyaged across the Atlantic Ocean to participate in the invasion of southern France and, but for refueling and replenishment breaks at Corsica, remained off that coast sweeping mines from the first assaults on the morning of 15 August until 21 September. At that time, she moved to Palermo, Sicily, where she performed additional minesweeping duties. YMS-164 continued to serve at various locations in the Mediterranean through the end of hostilities in Europe. The minesweeper headed back to the United States late in June 1945 and arrived in New York on Independence Day of that year. Not long thereafter, YMS-164 moved to the U.S. West Coast and ultimately to duty at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was serving at the end of World War II. Back on the west coast by the late spring of 1946, she was decommissioned at San Diego, California, on 7 June 1946. While in reserve at San Diego, the minesweeper was named Bobolink and redesignated AMS-2 on 17 February 1947. Though still out of commission, she served as a training ship for naval reservists in the 12th Naval District from November 1948 to May 1950. Bobolink was recommissioned at San Diego on 9 May 1950, and soon returned to active operations out of Pearl Harbor as a unit of the Pacific Fleet Mine Force. That assignment lasted until July 1953 when she returned to duty at San Diego for five months of operations from that port. In January 1954, she steamed via the Panama Canal to Charleston, South Carolina, where she became a unit of Mine Division (MinDiv) 43. Charleston served as her base of operations until March 1954 when she moved to the Mine Countermeasures Station at Panama City, Florida, located on the Gulf Coast of western Florida. That occupation prevailed for a year. In February 1955, Bobolink returned to Charleston to begin conversion to a coastal mine hunter. On 7 February 1955, she was redesignated MHC 44. The modifications took about seven months. She then conducted refresher training out of Norfolk, Virginia, from October to December before reporting for duty to the Commandant, 1st Naval District.

It is most likely an annual plant, though it has been reported to be a perennial. It grows from 10 to 25 cm tall. The spathulate or lanceolate leaves form a basal rosettes around the white stems. The leaves are around 6.5‚Äì27 mm long (mostly 11‚Äì13 cm) and 3‚Äì4.5 mm wide. Inflorescences are branched, around 10‚Äì25 cm long and produce flowers that are dark pink with red markings at the base of the corolla lobes and bloom from August to September in their native range. The anterior corolla lobes of this species cross over one another forming an x-shape. Stylidium weeliwolli is only known from a few locations in northwestern Western Australia, but it is locally abundant at these locations.

It has sedative and anxiolytic effects, and is a derivative of diazepam which has been substituted with a dimethylphosphoryl group to improve solubility in water. Fosazepam has similar effects on sleep as other benzodiazepines. In a clinical trial it was reported that fosazepam to lead to increased sleep duration with less broken sleep but sleep quality was worsened with suppressed deep sleep and increased light sleep. Adverse effects included feelings of impaired morning vitality and upon discontinuing the drug benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, impaired concentration and impaired morning vitality were experienced. Another clinical trial also found worsening of sleep while on benzodiazepines as well as during withdrawal with suppression of deep sleep stages including REM sleep, with increased light sleep upon withdrawal. The main metabolites of fosazepam are 3-hydroxyfosazepam and the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam which has a very long elimination half-life of about 3 days. Tolerance to the hypnotic effects of fosazepam starts to develop after about 7 days of use. Due to the very long elimination half-life of the active metabolite of fosazepam it is not recommended for use as a hypnotic. The main pharmacological effects of fosazepam may be due to its metabolite nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam), rather than the parent drug. The long-acting active metabolite nordazepam can cause extended sedative effects at high doses or with prolonged use, and may produce residual sedation upon awakening. Fosazepam is of relatively low potency compared to other benzodiazepine derivatives, with a 100 mg dose of fosazepam equivalent to 10 mg of nitrazepam. 60 mg of fosazepam has also been estimated to be equivalent to about 5‚Äì10 mg of diazepam. Fosazepam has similar effects to nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action and less tendency to cause over sedation, motor-impairment, amnesia, rebound insomnia, and morning grogginess.

He was a major figure in Argentine universities, including the University of Buenos Aires, where he was one of the founders of the economics department in 1958 and dean until 1972. He was also dean of the University of Belgrano and a professor emeritus of Universidad Argentina de la Empresa. Altogether in his distinguished academic career, he was a professor of economics in five different universities for over fifty years, continuing to teach until the age of 86. Biography Gomariz was born in Buenos Aires to unmarried immigrants from Spain. His father (also Jos√© Antonio Gomariz) left son and mother in an impoverished state in Buenos Aires after returning to Spain. Despite these humble beginnings, he excelled at school from a young age and graduated with honors with an accounting degree from the University of Buenos Aires. After a brief military career, he joined the Central Bank of Argentina within their executive development program. In 1944, the Central Bank of Argentina awarded him (and six others) a full scholarship to attend Harvard University's Masters in Public Administration program. At Harvard, he studied under the great economists Wassily Leontief, Joseph Schumpeter, John Kenneth Galbraith and others. After graduating with top honors from Harvard, he returned to Buenos Aires to work in the Central Bank. His career in the Central Bank was cut short however by the ascendancy of Juan Domingo Per√≥n, who saw the Harvard-trained economists as a threat to the populist movement. After Per√≥n was removed from office in 1955, Gomariz joined the University of Buenos Aires faculty, where he would become one of the founders of the Facultad de Econom√≠a (Economics faculty) as chair of the International Economics department. He would later also serve as president of EUDEBA, the university printing press, and as dean of the economics department until he was ousted in 1972 by Horacio Ciafardini as part of Peron's eventual return to power. In addition to his career in academia, Gomariz held a seat on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, was the chief financial officer of Acindar during its first five years of operations, was a practicing accountant and board member for several firms, and ran the first census for the government of Entre R√≠os Province.

Ltd. (ABA) was a company founded by Lang Hancock, operated between the years (1938‚Äì1966) responsible for the mining, bagging and distribution of blue asbestos or crocidolite, in Wittenoom, in northern Western Australia. The operation, purchased in 1943 by CSR Limited, was operated as a subsidiary until its closure in 1966. Due to litigation brought about by workers about the effects of inhalation of airborne fibres of blue asbestos, the company was forced to close. It was alleged that ABA was negligent in its behaviour in that, with respect to the workers, families and residents of Wittenoom, the company willingly knew that conditions were well below standard and that dust levels exceeded accepted levels of the day. Asbestos Blue asbestos is possibly 100 times more hazardous than white asbestos, as the fibres are much smaller (around 2.5 to 10 micrometres). The inhalation of asbestos results in illness and in most cases death, due to asbestosis, mesothelioma (of which asbestos is the only known cause) and other lung diseases. This aetiology was described, reported and explained to the management of ABA as well as being the subject of many medical journal articles. The asbestos fibre count at the mine and other facilities was regularly measured at 1000 parts per cm3 or more. This is in stark contrast to the health department guidelines of the 1950s that required less than 176 parts per cm3. By 1967 the 'safe' level of asbestos was limited to 5 parts per cm3. Litigation By 1988 a Supreme Court jury found that CSR had been \\"recklessly indifferent\\" to the safety of its workers and that ABA knowingly allowed the processing of asbestos to continue even though the dangers of asbestos fibre inhalation were known as early as 1926. One litigant, Klaus Rabenault, was awarded $426,000 in damages and CSR was fined $250,000 for its criminal behaviour. A year later, Klaus died of mesothelioma.Blue Murder, Ben Hills, 1989 The company was purchased from CSR Limited by James Hardie Industries Ltd and has now moved to the Netherlands in an apparent attempt to divorce itself from the asbestos crisis. Worker's compensation claims for previous workers, wives and offspring of residents of Wittenoom continue to be a big issue for company, which has not moved any further on the compensation case. The present number of known victims is around 2000. Since 1995, a disturbing trend has surfaced: many new cases of wives and children of workers from Wittenoom have been diagnosed with mesothelioma, possibly from washing dust-laden clothes of mine workers, while the children who used to play in the mine tailings that were spread over the streets at Wittenoom, have also been affected. The company was also subjected to court actions by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Tax Office (ATO) over its corporate tactics and activities. Latest information On 12 December 2008, James Hardie published a quarterly reportJames Hardie releases Quarterly Report Wotnews, 12 December 2008 stating that \\"James Hardie and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have reached an agreement which finalises tax audits being conducted by the ATO on the company‚Äôs Australian income tax returns for the years ended 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2004 through 31 March 2006 and settles all outstanding issues arising from these tax audits\\".

The great bulk of these (157) were for Worcestershire, which he captained for three seasons from 1923 to 1925. Foster also played first-class cricket for seven other teams, including the Gentlemen and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He was one of seven Foster brothers to play for Worcestershire, and one of three to captain the side. Though not a specialist wicket-keeper, he acted as such for Worcestershire on a more than 20 occasions in the 1920s, while his strictly occasional bowling brought him three wickets, and for Worcestershire against Surrey in 1909 he dismissed Jack Hobbs for 1. After a couple of games in Worcestershire's Second XI in 1907, Foster made his first-class debut for the county in August of the following year, against Lancashire at Worcester, and made 20 in his only innings. He played twice more that season, and ten times in 1909, but without great success. There then followed the first of several gaps in his cricketing career as a consequence of his business commitments. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1941. Though he played occasional minor games in Malaya over the next few years, he did not return to first-class cricket until 1914, in which season he played 19 matches, all in the County Championship. In scoring 1,103 runs at 31.51, he passed a thousand runs for the first time; he also hit two hundreds: 118 against Leicestershire in May, and what was to remain a career-best 158 (in a losing cause) against Derbyshire in August. The First World War then intervened, although Foster did play one first-class game during hostilities, in India in November 1917. This was a game staged at Calcutta between the Bengal Governor's XI (for whom Foster appeared, scoring 0 and 14) and the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI. The match was staged in aid of the \\"Our Day\\" Fund. The Governor's side were bowled out for 33 and 59, losing by an innings to the Maharaja's team, who made 138. Unusually, only two bowlers were used in each of the three innings in the match. Foster returned to Worcestershire action in 1920, although for three seasons his continuing overseas business meant that his appearances remained limited. However, in 1923 he was able to play a full season, and for four years he was highly successful, scoring over 1,300 runs in each summer, making a total of ten hundreds. In the weak Worcestershire team of that era, Roy Genders considered that he \\"carr[ied] the side on his shoulders\\". Foster was especially productive in June 1924, when he hit three centuries, and shortly afterwards was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players at both The Oval and Lord's, albeit with very little personal success. He captained the side between 1923 and 1925, although it was the following year, after he had relinquished the role to previous incumbent Maurice Jewell, that saw his heaviest run-scoring: 1,615 first-class runs at 32.95, with three hundreds and 12 fifties, including a hundred in each innings (141 and 106) against Hampshire. However, this was to be his last full season of first-class cricket, and he never again made a first-class fifty. He played three games in 1927, then nothing until his final four matches for the county seven years later, although he had turned out in the 1933 Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. In 1935, Foster played for MCC against Ireland at Lord's in a minor match, then in early August 1936 played in an equivalent match, but one which did qualify as first-class, at Dublin. In this, his final first-class game, Foster both captained and kept wicket, and brought off the stumping of Ireland opener Francis Connell. He made no other dismissals, and his 18 and 47 could not prevent a heavy defeat. He then played club cricket for Walsall Cricket Club until shortly before his death; the club won the Birmingham League three times while he was there. As mentioned above, six of his brothers played first-class cricket, as did three nephews (Christopher Foster, Peter Foster and John Greenstock) and his brother-in-law William Greenstock.

The defeat of the latter signalled the end to the \\"guerre folle\\" ('Mad war'), a feudal conflict in which French aristocrats revolted against royal power during the regency of Anne de Beaujeu. It also effectively precipitated the end of the independence of Brittany from France. Causes Brittany, Burgundy, and England had been repeatedly allied to resist the expansion of the French state. In the aftermath of the death of Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1477, the Burgundian threat to French power was all-but eliminated. Brittany became the main base for the feudal aristocrats in the League of the Public Weal, an alliance founded by Charles the Bold to resist the centralisation of power in the king. By 1488 the regime of Duke Francis had been severely weakened by conflict between his prime- minister Pierre Landais and a group of aristocrats led by the Prince of Orange John IV of Chalon-Arlay. Landais was keen to strengthen ties with England. His opponents secured French support for an armed incursion to overthrow and execute Landais in 1485, after which Jean de Rieux became de facto chief minister. Francis was keen to secure the independence of Brittany and to construct a network of alliances to achieve that objective, offering the prospect of marriage to his daughter and heir Anne of Brittany to several possible allies. Rebel lords from the League, notably Louis d'Orleans, had sought sanctuary in Brittany. The French saw this as a violation of royal rights, and demanded the return of the lords, asserting that they had the right to take them by force if Francis refused. Background Under the leadership of Louis II de la Tr√©moille, the French royal army had struck against Vannes and Foug√®res, controlling access to Brittany. The French attempted to take control of the major strategic strongholds. The Bretons had sought support from various rebel lords and opponents of expanding French power. Alain d'Albret, a rebel lord, believing he would marry Anne, had reinforced the Breton army with 5,000 troops supplied by the king of Spain. Maximilian I of Austria also sent 1,500 men. Henry VII of England was also approached for support, but refused to send troops and instead attempted to negotiate a deal with the French to stop the invasion. However the English knight Edward Woodville, Lord Scales, defied Henry and brought over a small force of 700 archers he had gathered from his base in the Isle of Wight.John M. Currin, \\"The King's Army into the Partes of Bretaigne': Henry VII and the Breton Wars\\", War in History, Vol. 7, No. 4, 379-412 (2000) The Bretons decided to create the impression that Henry had changed his mind and had sent a large force of longbowmen, dressing 1,300 of their own men in the English cross of St George and adding them to Lord Scales' troops to create a vanguard of 2,000 men. Despite this concentration of forces the Breton alliance was still significantly outnumbered. It was further weakened because Maximilian I was diverted by a rebellion in Flanders, which was being supported by Marshal de Esquerdes. The Breton forces thus comprised a mix of local troops with Gascons, Germans, English longbowmen, and non-Breton aristocrats who were challenging royal power. The French army included Swiss and Italian mercenaries, and also some pro-royal Breton noblemen. It had the most powerful artillery of the era. The battle The Breton commander de Rieux positioned his forces on a ridge around a mile to the south of M√©zi√®res-sur-Couesnon. French forces arrived at the field in disparate groups, with no idea that the Bretons were so close. The Bretons initially had the advantage that the French were fragmented and not arrayed in battle order. Lord Scales and de Rieux were in favour of a rapid attack on the French before they could manoeuvre into effective battle order, but d'Albret insisted on redeploying his troops. As a result, de la Tr√©moille had time to place his army in a defensive formation. The Breton vanguard under Lord Scales then led the attack in an arrow-head formation. According to Jean Molinet, \\"the English archers showed great courage, for each of the opposing parties fought for victory.\\" Scales himself was apparently killed at some point in this stage of the battle. Nevertheless, the French were forced to pull back, giving the archers a chance to attack the French lines, causing panic, which was stemmed by the French commanders.Wilkins, Christopher, The Last Knight Errant: Edward Woodville and the Age of Chivalry, IB Tauris, 2009, pp. 162-3. Meanwhile, the Breton centre under d'Albret was moving forward, having been suffering significant casualties from the powerful French artillery in its static position. The redeployment caused a gap to open in the Breton lines. Jacques Galliota, an Italian captain in the French army, immediately asked permission from Tr√©moille to exploit the opportunity. Tr√©moille agreed, and Galliota led a cavalry attack on the weakened position. Galliota himself was killed, but the Italians opened a gap through which the cavalry passed. D'Albret and de Rieux failed to deploy their own cavalry in time to stem the gap, and Tr√©moille quickly sent in more French troops. At the same time there was a massive explosion in one of the magazines behind the Breton lines, probably caused by stray shot. Panic ran through the Breton army, leading to a rout of their forces. Consequences The defeat of Francis II forced him to accept a treaty which deprived him of power by requiring him to expel foreign princes and troops from Brittany. It also restricted his ability to marry his children to suitors of his choosing and required that he cede territory in Saint-Malo, Foug√®res, Dinan, and Saint-Aubin to the king as a guarantee that in the absence of a male successor the king would determine the succession. Francis died a few months later leaving only a daughter, Anne of Brittany, so the treaty was used to force her, as his successor, to marry King Charles VIII, and then Louis XII. The battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier also destroyed the power-base of the warring princes. Edward Woodville was killed, along with his entire force. Louis of Orleans (the future Louis XII), and Jean IV, Prince of Orange were captured. Alain d'Albret and the Mar√©chal de Rieux succeeded in escaping, and played an important part in continuing the conflict. Despite the French victory, the guerre folle dragged on for three more years until December 1491, when Charles married Anne. Role in Breton nationalism Since the emergence of modern Breton nationalism in the 19th century, the battle has been portrayed as the moment when Brittany lost its independence, despite the three years of struggle which followed it and the continued nominal independence of the Duchy into the 16th century. It is thus regarded by nationalists as a tragic episode in the history of Brittany. In the words of Leon Meur, \\"the battle of Saint-Aubin rang the death-knell of Breton independence\\". The Breton nationalist C√©lestin Lain√©, who sided with Nazi Germany in World War II, stated that his SS-affiliated Bezen Perrot militia was the first Breton force to have fought against France since the battle. At his death he requested that his ashes be scattered on the spot. The Breton National Party placed a cross at the site of the battle in 1932.Les √©l√®ves de 3e cycle fran√ßais-breton de Saint-Michel de Rennes visitent le champ de bataille et le ch√¢teau de Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier To mark the 500th anniversary of the battle a large monument was erected in 1988, comprising a raised platform with plaques commemorating the forces involved, surmounted by a shield bearing the Breton Ducal coat of arms and a Cross patt√©e. The Breton nationalist organization Koun Breizh commemorates the battle at the site on the last Sunday of every July, and the far-right nationalist group Adsav also commemorates it in September. A plan in 2000 to bury domestic waste on the site of the battle caused such protests from the Breton movement that the project was abandoned.St Aubin-du-Cormier: 1488-2000 A \\"cairn of liberty\\" was built at the site of the proposed dump. Breton nationalist groups subsequently acquired part of the land with the intention of creating a sculpture park and visitor centre.

Gameplay Deca Sports features a number of different game modes: * Open Match: A quick start match that allows you to immediately jump into any of the 10 available sport events. * Tournament Mode: Tackle one individual event to become the champion at that particular sport. * Deca League: Take on a number of different teams at every sport available in the game. * Deca Challenge: Test yourself at each sport in specialized events designed to hone your skill and control. Deca Sports does not feature the use of Miis. Instead, eight different teams (Average Joes, Speed Strikers, Hard Hitters, Crusaders, Boost Force, Mad Maidens, Team Thunder and Disco Knights) are available for selection in the various sporting events. Each team is made up of small, medium and large players of both genders. Small athletes are nimble, but are not too strong, while large athletes are powerful, but are slower and a little harder to control. Medium-size players provide a compromise between speed and strength. Team member size becomes more important during Deca League, where playing one team member for too long will result in fatigue and decreased performance. There are 10 different sports listed, each of which having its own control scheme specific to the Wii Remote. For Beach Volleyball, the game controls the movement of the player and the teammates as the player pulls the Wii Remote to return and pass the ball to the opponent's side of the court. Different variations of serves and volleys can be performed. In Figure Skating, the player uses the Nunchuk's analog stick to skate along three different predetermined routines which are tied to music. While navigating the skater along a line with yellow dots, large circles that differ in color type will appear. Once they enter those circles, shaking the Wii Remote will execute the maneuvers. *Archery: The player holds down the B Button on the Wii Remote and pulls it back to draw the arrow, then aims with the pointer. Within ten seconds, he/she must release the B Button to launch the arrow at the target. *Badminton: The Wii Remote is used as a racquet in this sport. The player must swing the Remote with good timing to return the shuttle towards the opponent, and can also control which way the shuttle goes by moving the Remote left or right after a downward swing. *Basketball: The player uses the Nunchuk's analog stick to move a player, while using buttons to pass to or control teammates and Wii Remote gestures to shoot or steal. *Curling: The player holds down the B Button, which causes a power meter to increase and decrease, before flicking the Wii Remote right at the moment the desired power level is reached to launch a stone down the ice. If the stone needs to coast further, the player shakes the Wii Remote to sweep the ice in front of the stone. *Football (soccer): The player uses the Nunchuk's analog stick to move a player, buttons to pass to or control teammates and Wii Remote gestures to pass and shoot. *Kart racing: The player holds the Wii Remote sideways as if it were a steering wheel and tilts it to steer while using the number buttons as pedals. *Snowboard cross: The player points the Wii Remote at the lower part of the screen to accelerate down the slopes, while twisting it left or right to steer and being careful not to over-turn and wipe out. *Supercross: Controls are similar to that of go-kart racing, but the player can also shake the Wii Remote to execute tricks or roll it backward or forwards to make a good landing after a jump.Gamespot: Deca Sports Updated Hands-OnTGS 2007: Deca Sporta Hands-onIGN: Deca Sports Preview Development The game was initially revealed at TGS 2007 under the title of Deca Sporta, a planned December due date in Japan. A representative for Hudson claimed that the studio didn't anticipate high review scores, noting the simplicity and graphics quality as \\"typical complaints of Wii games\\". In April 2008, the game went gold with an announced release date of May 13 for North America. Mike Samachisa, the head of Hudson's console team, mentioned that localizing Deca Sports for the English version made sense, as the sports contained are played around the world. The idea was to combine sports events from Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games and X Games, creating a compilation game that would have a wide appeal. Every mode is unlocked within the game right from the beginning as everything was designed to be accessible. Adidas signed a partnership with Hudson, allowing its logo to appear in-game. The developers opened a poll on the Deca Sports' official website, where people were able to decide which events would appear in the next title of the series. Reception Deca Sports got generally mediocre to negative reviews. GameSpot gave Deca Sports a 3.5/10. IGN gave it a 4.5/10. 1UP gave it a D+. In spite of the poor critical reception, the game has reportedly sold well. Hudson Soft, the publisher of the game, announced it sold 2 million units of Deca Sports since launch. Deca Sports was nominated for \\"Worst Game Everyone Played\\" by GameSpot in its 2008 video game awards. Sequels The game eventually spawned a trilogy on the Wii and three spin-offs on different platforms, but the two sequels that followed the original title failed to repeat its commercial success. Deca Sports 2 (Deca Sporta 2 in Japan, Sports Island 2 in Europe) was developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Wii. The game was released in Japan on April 16, 2009, in Europe on May 15, 2009, in Australia in June 4, 2009 and in North America on September 29, 2009.http://wii.ign.com/articles/971/971888p1.html The game has ten sports: Downhill Skiing, Bocce Ball, Tennis, Ice hockey, Kendo, Darts, Dodgeball, Speed Skating, Synchronized swimming and Motorcycle Racing. Three of the ten sports, ice hockey, speed skating and mogul skiing, coincidentally were in the 2010 Winter Olympics set to take place in Vancouver, Canada several months after the game's release.

The classic example of a reliable byte stream communication protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol, one of the major building blocks of the Internet. A reliable byte stream is not the only reliable service paradigm which computer network communication protocols provide, however; other protocols (e.g. SCTP) provide a reliable message stream, i.e. the data is divided up into distinct units, which are provided to the consumer of the data as discrete objects.  Mechanism  Communication protocols which implement reliable byte streams, generally over some unreliable lower level, use a number of mechanisms to provide that reliability. ARQ protocols have an important role for achieving reliability. All data items are identified with a sequence number, which is used both to make sure that the data are delivered to the entity at the other end in the correct order, and to check for lost data items. The receiver sends back acknowledgements for data items which have been successfully received; a timer at the sender will cause a timeout if an acknowledgement is not received within a reasonable round trip time, and the (presumably lost) data will then be re-transmitted. To check that no data items are damaged, a checksum is used; one is computed at the sender for each block of data before it is sent, and checked at the receiver. Erroneous or missing data are reported to the sender, in order that it may retransmit the same. Any duplicated data items are discarded.  See also  *Automatic repeat request  References  * Larry L.

Early life and education Ralph L. Brinster grew up on a small farm in Cedar Grove, New Jersey where his parents raised purebred animals. He studied animal science as an undergraduate at the Cook School of Agriculture, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and completed his B.S. in 1953. He was an officer in the United States Air Force (1953‚Äì1956) and served during the Korean War. He returned from military service and earned his V.M.D. (1960) and his Ph.D. in Physiology (1964) from the University of Pennsylvania. Research impact Ralph Brinster is acknowledged as one of the seminal founders of the field of mammalian transgenesis. He is known throughout the scientific community for his revolutionary research in embryonic-cell differentiation, developmental mechanisms of gene control, and stem cell physiology. During the 1960s, Brinster pioneered the development of techniques to manipulate mouse embryos‚Äîhis techniques have made the mouse the major genetic model for understanding the basis of human biology and disease. His research has provided the experimental foundation for progress in germline genetic modification in a range of species, which has generated a revolution in biology, medicine, and agriculture. His h-index, a commonly used calculation estimating research impact, is 120, which ranks among the highest in the life sciences. Research history While a Ph.D. candidate in the 1960s, Brinster developed the first reliable in vitro culture system for early mammalian embryos. These techniques have been conserved to the present day and form the foundation for all experimentation with the mammalian embryo - including transgenic, embryonic stem cell, human and mammalian in vitro fertilization, mammalian cloning, and knockout technology. This \\"Brinster Method\\" of embryo manipulation is so ubiquitous in modern biology that other scientists rarely cite the work in current publications. Brinster first showed that it was possible to colonize a mouse blastocyst with stem cells from older embryos. Moreover, Brinster first demonstrated that foreign teratocarcinoma cells could combine with native blastocyst cells to form adult \\"chimeric\\" mice, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to change the genetic character of mice. This discovery stimulated the search for embryonic stem cells and ultimately led to the development of the \\"knock-out mouse\\" by other teams. He was the first scientist to microinject fertilized eggs with RNA and DNA, and was at the forefront of the field in applying these microinjection methods to generate transgenic mice. Brinster and longtime collaborator Richard Palmiter pioneered techniques to transfer foreign genes into mammals, and they utilized these methods to elucidate the activity and function of genes. They developed the first \\"transgenic mice\\", in fact the two established the term \\"transgenic\\" in the scientific literature in a foundational paper, and their seminal experiments catalyzed a worldwide revolution in genetic engineering in the 1980s. Transgenic mice are now used every day in thousands of laboratories around the world to investigate everything from cancer biology and cardiovascular disease to hair loss and abnormal behavior. Their experiments showed that new genes could be, for the first time, introduced into the mammalian germline with the potential to increase disease resistance, enhance growth, and produce vital proteins like blood-clotting factors needed by hemophiliacs. In addition, they provided the first proof of expression of transgenes, the first example of cancer arising from a transgene (the seminal \\"oncomouse\\"), and the first proof of the targeted integration of DNA by egg injection. Each of these three revolutionary discoveries have themselves launched entire fields of scientific inquiry. Together, Palmiter and Brinster developed many of the first animal models of human disease throughout the 1980s. Their partnership also yielded the first transgenic rabbits, sheep, and pigs. This transcontinental collaboration constructed a body of work that formed the foundation for a generation of scientific progress in genetic modification via transgenesis, homologous recombination or \\"knock-out\\" techniques, and cloning. In recent years, Brinster has continued to advance the field of stem cell biology, having made a series of catalyzing, transformational discoveries utilizing male germ line stem cells.

He is recognized as the father of modern sleep research, and is the author of the seminal 1939 book Sleep and Wakefulness. Biography=Early life Nathaniel Kleitman was born in Chi»ôinƒÉu, also known as Kishinev, the capital of the province of Bessarabia (now Moldova), in 1895 to a Jewish family. He was deeply interested in consciousness and reasoned that he could get insight in consciousness by studying the unconsciousness of sleep. Pogroms drove him to Palestine, and in 1915 he emigrated to the United States as a result of World War I. At the age of twenty, he landed in New York City penniless; in 1923, at age twenty-eight, he had worked his way through City College and earned a PhD from the University of Chicago's Department of Physiology. His thesis was \\"Studies on the physiology of sleep.\\" Soon after, in 1925, he joined the faculty there. An early sponsor of Kleitman's sleep research was the Wander Company, which manufactured Ovaltine and hoped to promote it as a remedy for insomnia. REM sleep Eugene Aserinsky, one of Kleitman's graduate students, decided to hook sleepers up to an early version of an electroencephalogram machine, which scribbled across of paper each night. In the process, Aserinsky noticed that several times each night the sleepers went through periods when their eyes darted wildly back and forth. Kleitman insisted that the experiment be repeated yet again, this time on his daughter, Esther. In 1953, he and Aserinsky introduced the world to \\"rapid-eye movement,\\" or REM sleep. Kleitman and Aserinsky demonstrated that REM sleep was correlated with dreaming and brain activity. Another of Kleitman's graduate students, William C. Dement, now a professor of psychiatry at the Stanford medical school, has described this as the year that \\"the study of sleep became a true scientific field.\\" Rest activity cycle Kleitman made countless additional contributions to the field of sleep research and was especially interested in \\"rest-activity\\" cycles, leading to many fundamental findings on circadian and ultradian rhythms. Kleitman proposed the existence of a Basic rest activity cycle, or BRAC, during both sleep and wakefulness.Kleitman, N., Sleep and Wakefulness, 1963, Reprint 1987: Kleitman, N., Basic rest-activity cycle‚Äî22 years later, Journal of Sleep Research & Sleep Medicine, Vol 5(4), Dec 1982, 311-317 Other experiments Renowned for his personal and experimental rigor, he conducted well-known sleep studies underground in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky and lesser-known studies underwater in submarines during World War II and above the Arctic Circle.

His work explores the issues surrounding personal identity such as family, community and the environment through the use of discarded materials. He was the first director of the Watts Towers Art Center, and served in that role for seventeen years. His sculpture work has been reviewed in the New York Times,Mention in New York Times art review and his work is owned by many prominent museums.  Personal life  John Wilfred Outterbridge was born on March 12, 1933, and grew up in Greenville, North Carolina. His father made a living by recycling metal machine parts and equipment, and Outterbridge was exposed to recycling materials as a result. His college education began at the Agricultural and Technical University in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he studied to become a mechanical engineer. A year later, Outterbridge joined the military, where his interests in art developed seriously. Once he finished serving in 1956, he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Art and later the American Academy of Art. In the 1960s, he got married and moved to Los Angeles. Here, he became a highly respected community activist, educator and director of the Watts Towers Arts Center. In 1991, Outterbridge retired and pursued a greater focus on art.  Artistic career  During a tour of duty in Europe, Outterbridge visited museums and painted street scenes from life in his spare time. His paintings were well liked, and he painted murals and artwork for offices, clubs and American schools. Once he moved to L.A., Outterbridge began to combine painting with the collection of objects. His first real forays into assemblage were a series of car sculptures made of stainless steel from a junkyard. He believed the materials society used said a lot about the attitudes and history of people. Some of his earliest and widely known works were made during the Watts Riots. From 1963 to 1971, rioting and civil unrest struck the nation's black communities, resulting in the signing of the Civil Rights bill. It was a sign that race relations were a real problem in the USA that needed to be addressed. Outterbridge collected the debris that covered the streets from this historic event to create sculptures. The final work was deeply steeped in politics and resulted in Outterbridge continuing to confront these themes in his work. Through this, Outterbridge befriended artists who were interested in the same subject matter‚Äî such as David Hammons, Timothy Washington, and John T. Riddle Jr.‚Äîand revived the California Assemblage Movement, where he would become a prominent figure. The Containment Series (1968) was another one of Outterbridge's forays into assemblage. It grew out of an interest in containment and a desire to disrupt the societal and institutional norms that reinforced it. To do so, he destroyed the canvas and covered it with items like aluminum panels, bolts, leather belts and paint. Outterbridge also relied on the muted natural colors of the object he found and reserves louder colors for focal points. Recent work recounts some of the ideas Outterbridge investigated in earlier sculptures. In Dreads (2011), he assembles a mallet and his own clipped dreadlocks. The handle of the mallet is phallic and according to Outterbridge alludes to the concept of passion. Outterbridge incorporates history in many of his pieces. Case in Point, from the Rag-Man series, is a piece of luggage reminiscent of dynamite and is symbolic of the Great Migration. Attached to the cylindrical forms is a baggage tag that says, \\"packages travel like people\\". Case in Point confronts the racist reality of African Americans at home after serving the country in the Korean War. Although Outterbridge lived a relatively successful life, his pursuits into education and community activism did take a toll on his artistic career. Coupled with the quiet segregation of the art world up till the 21st century, Outterbridge did not receive much acclaim from his work outside of the West Coast until 1994. He represented the United States at the S√£o Paulo Biennale in a show called The Art of Betye Saar and John Outterbridge: The Poetics of Politics, Iconography and Spirituality. Nearly 20 years after he began practicing as a professional artist, a new generation has come to appreciate his vast body of work. Outterbridge has appeared in many group and solo exhibitions, such as The Rag Factory (2011) at LAXART, his first solo exhibition since 1966. The Rag Factory was an installation using rags that Outterbridge collected from the streets and factories of downtown Los Angeles. Using these castaways, Outterbridge created elegant and evocative forms by tying, draping, folding, gathering and suspending them. Awards In 2012, the California African American Museum gave their lifetime achievement award to John Outterbridge. He was named a United States Artists Gracie Fellow for Visual Arts in 2011.United States Artists official website. , In 1994, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Otis College of Art and Design. In addition to these, Outterbridge has received fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation, Getty Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.

James Earl Wright, who competed in North American regional promotions including the Mid-South region and the National Wrestling Alliance, particularly the Georgia and Florida territories, as well as brief stints in the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling, most notably as one half of the tag team State Patrol with Buddy Lee Parker during the 1990s. He would also have a successful career teaming with Bob Brown in international promotions including Continental Championship Wrestling, Stampede Wrestling and the World Wrestling Council (WWC). Career=Early career Dale Veasey made his professional debut in early 1982, beginning his career in Georgia and Florida. Later that year however, he disappeared from the scene and did not reappear until February 1984, in Georgia Championship Wrestling. The on-air reason given for his hiatus was that he had been in a serious automobile accident, breaking his ankle, jaw, right arm, and also suffering two skull fractures. On his return he was heavier than when last seen in 1982, but spent the next few months trimming down. Veasey was still with the promotion when Black Saturday occurred, at which point he transition to other territories, losing several singles matches to Tim Horner, Shawn Michaels, Terry Taylor and Iceman Parsons while in the Mid-South territory in January 1985 and spending most of the year wrestling in Florida Championship Wrestling facing veterans such as Wahoo McDaniel, Rip Rogers and Hector Guerrero. While in Texas All-Star Wrestling, he also defeated Terry Daniels in a tournament final to win the vacant TASW Junior Heavyweight Championship in San Antonio, Texas on September 2, 1985 holding the title for four months before leaving the area. The Alaskan Hunters & State Patrol The following year, Veasey underwent another physical transformation into Road Warriors-inspired, The Hunter. He spent most of 1986/1987 wrestling as either The Hunter in singles competition or with tag-team partner Bob Brown as The Alaskan Hunters, going on to win the WWC North American Tag Team Championship with Brown defeating Miguelito Perez & Tony Atlas in San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 20, 1987. After defeating WWC World Tag Team Champions Mark & Chris Youngblood on August 26, the two would briefly hold both the World and North American tag team titles before losing the World titles back to the Youngbloods September 20, 1987. After the North American titles were abandoned by the promotion in November, Veasey and Brown would leave the promotion by the end of the year. Early in 1989, Veasey and Brown spent some time in the World Wrestling Federation and, later, a very short spell in Stampede Wrestling, but by the end of 1989 Veasey was in World Championship Wrestling as 'Lieutenant James Earl Wright' along with 'Sergeant Buddy Lee Parker', his tag team partner in the State Patrol (which first formed while both were in Stampede). World Championship Wrestling Making their debut in late 1989, the State Patrol substituted for the Samoan Swat Team and were defeated by the NWA/WCW US Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers at Chicago‚Äôs UIC Pavilion on September 30 and also faced Ricky Morton & Tommy Rich on December 14, 1990. During 1991, Wright and Parker regularly appeared on televised shows including WCW Power Hour and WCW Saturday Night. After losing to Brian Pillman in a singles match on WCW Power Hour on January 26, both he and Parker brawled with Pillman afterwards with Pillman getting the upper hand. This would lead to a brief feud which resulted in a rematch at Clash of the Champions XIV on January 30 with Wright again losing to Pillman. Although having success against preliminary wrestlers in early 1991, Veasey and Parker teamed with Big Cat in a losing effort against the then WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Champions Junkyard Dog, Ricky Morton & Tommy Rich at WrestleWar ‚Äò91 on February 24, 1991. He would also lose a series of single matches to Junkyard Dog and Dustin Rhodes during the next two months, before losing to Big Van Vader in a handicap match with Joe Cazana on April 24, 1991. The following year, Veasey lost to \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan in a match for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship on November 20 and, with Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker, lost to then WCW World Tag Team Champions The American Males on December 7, 1994. Appearing on WCW Saturday Night during early 1995, he lost singles matches against Sting, Brian Pillman and Renegade. Although losing to the American Males on August 21, they would later defeat Col. Robert Lee Parker's Stud Stable (Bunkhouse Buck & \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater) during WCW Monday Nitro on September 18. Losing to The Nasty Boys on October 11 and Sting & Ric Flair on October 25, he and Parker would later appear in a 60-man Battle Royal where both he and his partner were eliminated by Cobra at World War Three '95 on November 11, 1995. After being eliminated, Veasey/Wright pulled Cobra out of the ring eliminating him from the battle royal as well, however nothing came from this. The following year, the State Patrol lost a match against Harlem Heat on WCW Saturday Night in Rome, Georgia on March 30, 1996. The State Patrol also toured Japan several times during the 1990s, and in the late 1990s Veasey retired from active competition although he has since wrestled in the Georgia-based Columbus Championship Wrestling in January 2002.

It promotes female sex development and represses male sex development. Loss of function can have serious consequences, such as female to male sex reversal.  Function  The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and embryogenesis. Pregnancy WNT4 is involved in a couple features of pregnancy as a downstream target of BMP2. For example, it regulates endometrial stromal cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. These processes are all necessary for the development of an embryo. Ablation in female mice results in subfertility, with defects in implantation and decidualization. For instance, there is a decrease in responsiveness to progesterone signaling. Furthermore, postnatal uterine differentiation is characterized by a reduction in gland numbers and the stratification of the luminal epithelium.  Sexual development  Early gonads = Gonads arise from the thickening of coelomic epithelium, which at first appears as multiple cell layers. They later commit to sex determination, becoming either female or male under normal circumstances. Regardless of sex, though, WNT4 is needed for cell proliferation. In mouse gonads, it has been detected only eleven days after fertilization. If deficient in XY mice, there is a delay in Sertoli cell differentiation. Moreover, there is delay in sex cord formation. These issues are usually compensated for at birth. WNT4 also interacts with RSPO1 early in development. If both are deficient in XY mice, the outcome is less expression of SRY and downstream targets. Furthermore, the amount of SOX9 is reduced and defects in vascularization are found. These occurrences result in testicular hypoplasia. Male to female sex reversal, however, does not occur because Leydig cells remain normal. They are maintained by steroidogenic cells, now unrepressed. = Ovaries = WNT4 is required for female sex development. Upon secretion it binds to Frizzled receptors, activating a number of molecular pathways. One important example is the stabilization of Œ≤ catenin, which increases the expression of target genes. For instance, TAFIIs 105 is now encoded, a subunit of the TATA binding protein for RNA polymerase in ovarian follicle cells. Without it, female mice have small ovaries with less mature follicles. In addition, the production of SOX9 is blocked. In humans, WNT4 also suppresses 5-Œ± reductase activity, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. External male genitalia are therefore not formed. Moreover, it contributes to the formation of the M√ºllerian duct, a precursor to female reproductive organs. = Male sexual development = The absence of WNT4 is required for male sex development. FGF signaling suppresses WNT4, acting in a feed forward loop triggered by SOX9. If this signaling is deficient in XY mice, female genes are unrepressed. With no FGF2, there is a partial sex reversal. With no FGF9, there is a full sex reversal. Both cases are rescued, though, by a WNT4 deletion. In these double mutants, the resulting somatic cells are normal.  Kidneys  WNT4 is essential for nephrogenesis. It regulates kidney tubule induction and the mesenchymal to epithelial transformation in the cortical region. In addition, it influences the fate of the medullary stroma during development. Without it, smooth muscle Œ± actin is markedly reduced. This occurrence causes pericyte deficiency around the vessels, leading to a defect in maturation. WNT4 probably functions by activating BMP4, a known smooth muscle differentiation factor.  Muscles  WNT4 contributes to the formation of the neuromuscular junction in vertebrates. Expression is high during the creation of first synaptic contacts, but subsequently downregulated. Moreover, loss of function causes a 35 percent decrease in the number of acetylcholine receptors. Overexpression, however, causes an increase. These events alter fiber type composition with the production of more slow fibers. Lastly, MuSK is the receptor for WNT4, activated through tyrosine phosphorylation. It contains a CRD domain similar to Frizzled receptors. Lungs WNT4 is also associated with lung formation and has a role in the formation of the respiratory system. When WNT4 is knocked out, there are many problems that occur in lung development. It has been shown that when WNT4 is knocked out, the lung buds formed are reduced in size and proliferation has greatly diminished which cause underdeveloped or incomplete development of the lungs. It also causes tracheal abnormalities because it affects the tracheal cartilage ring formation. Lastly, the absence of WNT4 also affects the expression of other genes that function in lung development such as Sox9 and FGF9.  Clinical significance = Deficiency  Several mutations are known to cause loss of function in WNT4. One example is a heterozygous C to T transition in exon 2. This causes an arginine to cysteine substitution at amino acid position 83, a conserved location. The formation of illegitimate sulfide bonds creates a misfolded protein, resulting in loss of function. In XX humans, WNT4 now cannot stabilize Œ≤-catenin. Furthermore, steroidogenic enzymes like CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 are not suppressed, leading to an increase in testosterone production. Along with this androgen excess, patients have no uteruses. Other M√ºllerian abnormalities, however, are not found. This disorder is therefore distinct from classic Mayer-Rokitansky- Kuster-Hauser syndrome.  SERKAL syndrome  A disruption of WNT4 synthesis in XX humans produces SERKAL syndrome. The genetic mutation is a homozygous C to T transition at cDNA position 341. This causes an alanine to valine residue substitution at amino acid position 114, a location highly conserved in all organisms, including zebrafish and Drosophila. The result is loss of function, which affects mRNA stability. Ultimately it causes female to male sex reversal.  Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome  WNT4 has been clearly implicated in the atypical version of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndromefound in XX humans. A genetic mutation causes a leucine to proline residue substitution at amino acid position 12. This occurrence reduces the intranuclear levels of Œ≤-catenin. In addition, it removes the inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes like 3Œ≤-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase and 17Œ±-hydroxylase. Patients usually have uterine hypoplasia, which is associated with biological symptoms of androgen excess. Furthermore, M√ºllerian abnormalities are often found.

The same materials can also be used for symbolic or representational drawings. Building material on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, paper) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a spiral notebook). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse. Archaeology Because drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the stone walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor was tally sticks used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time (days). Tally sticks have been found made of wood and of bone. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal hides also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, birch bark is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America. Four other classes of material were sometimes used for writing: clay, wax, cloth, and metal. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for curse tablets, as well as personal correspondence. Cloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. Stone tablets, clay and wooden writing tablets, and wax-covered wooden tablets are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing. Unglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as ostraka, for tax receipts, and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for ostracism. The archaeological record contains either example of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying. The Quipu or talking knots were recording devices fashioned from strings historically used by a number of cultures in the region of Andean South America. Knotted strings were used by many other cultures such as the ancient Chinese and native Hawaiians, but such practices should not be confused with the quipu, which refers only to the Andean device. Common writing materials of the Middle Ages In western civilizations, papyrus, which originated in 3,000 B.C.E. in Egypt, was later replaced by parchment made by treating animal hide, a process starting in the second century B.C. in the Mediterranean region A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different textures, quality and hue were widely used for codices, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of paper. In eastern civilisations such as India, the principal writing media were birch bark or bhurjapatra (Sanskrit) and dried palm leaves. The use of paper began only after the 10th century. However, birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations, and other cultural uses. In China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, bamboo and wooden slips, until the 2nd century when paper was invented. Paper, being invented in 105 A.D. wasn't introduced to Europe for another thousand years following a battle in 751 A.D. where a few paper-makers were captured and thus the technology spread from Baghdad westward, only reaching Spain in the 12th century. History Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of papyrus in Egypt. Parchment, using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of wood-pulp paper, the cost of writing material began a steady decline. Electronic media Electronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to provide another form of writing material. The Palm Pilot was invented in 1996 and further changed the idea of electronic devices as writing materials. It was the first consumer product which allowed people to write directly on an electronic screen using a stylus, rather than having to input their writing using a keyboard.

Heger has both a bachelor's degree and an M.D. from the University of Southern California. Biography In 1984, Heger founded the Center for the Vulnerable Child (CVC) for the evaluation of child abuse. This was the first medically based Child Advocacy Center in the world and currently evaluates over 10,000 child abuse and child sexual assault victims every year. This model program has been replicated in hundreds of programs around the world. Renamed the Violence Intervention Program (VIP), Heger established the first of its kind, \\"one stop shop\\" community Family Advocacy Center, offering medical, mental health, protective, legal and social services to victims of family violence and sexual assault throughout Los Angeles County. With increasing pressure from law enforcement and social services to answer the need for improved services for adolescents and adults, in 1995 the program added interventions for sexual assault and domestic violence. Today, the VIP also serves over 4000 victims of elder and dependent adult abuse. Most recently Heger has implemented a model \\"HUB\\" program with services for children at risk for or already in foster care. This center incorporates 24/7 forensic and medical assessments with an ongoing medical home with built-in mental health services and support services that include dental care, plastic surgery, mentoring and tutoring. Over the past two years the VIP has built and renovated over creating the S. Mark Taper Family Advocacy Center and the Santana House as a campus of services for children and families impacted by violence. This expanded space made it possible to expand HUB services and the creation of the Los Angeles County Elder Abuse Forensic Center. In addition to her work providing medical and forensic interventions to children and adolescents impacted by family and sexual violence, Heger serves as a consultant to the Los Angeles County Coroner in cases involving child death or sexual assault in all ages. She was an expert witness at the McMartin preschool trial. Journalist John Earl believes that Heger's findings were based on unsubstantiated medical histories. Children's Institute International Critics have alleged that the questioners asked the children leading questions, repetitively, which, it is said,Fischer, Mary, \\"A Case of Dominoes?\\" Los Angeles Magazine, September 25, 1989, p. 132 always yields positive responses from young children, making it impossible to know what the child actually experienced. Others believe that the questioning itself may have led to false-memory syndrome among the children who were questioned. Ultimately only 41 of the original 360 children testified during the grand jury and pre-trial hearings, and less than a dozen testified during the actual trial. One of the children recanted in 2005.

Landwehr-Division (Chronik 1914/1919) The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The Landwehr was the third category of the German Army, after the regular Army and the reserves. Thus Landwehr divisions were generally made up of older soldiers who had passed from the reserves, and were intended primarily for occupation and security duties rather than heavy combat. Combat chronicle The 85th Landwehr Division served on the Eastern Front. It occupied the line by M≈Çawa from November 1914 to July 1915 and then participated in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, breaking through at Przasnysz and fighting on the Narew, and then participating in follow-on fighting for the next several months. In September 1915, it was in the Lithuanian swamps. It was engaged in positional warfare in the Vishnev sector on the Berezina, Olshanka and Krevljanka Rivers from September 1915 to October 1917. It moved with the line northwards in a series of fights until the armistice on the Eastern Front. The division fought in Estonia in February/March 1918, and then served as occupation troops in Estonia and Russia until the end of World War I in November 1918. Elements of the division were being transferred to Belgium at the time of the Armistice on the Western Front, and other elements remained in Lithuania and White Russia as security forces for several months after the end of World War I, finally departing in February 1919.

The dialogue format allowed the reader to understand the respective perspectives of the various market participants and the intricacies of speculation and trading. There is evidence in Confusion de Confusiones of three major biases: herding, overconfidence and regret aversion.Teresa Corzo, Margarita Prat & Esther Vaquero (2014) Behavioral Finance in Joseph de la Vega's Confusion de Confusiones, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 15:4, 341-350, DOI: 10.1080/15427560.2014.968722 Joseph also came up with four basic rules of the share market that are still of the greatest relevance today.Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Selected and Translated by Professor Hermann Kellenbenz Hochschule fur Wirtschafts und Sozialwissenschaften > The first rule in speculation is: Never advise anyone to buy or sell shares. > Where guessing correctly is a form of witchcraft, counsel cannot be put on > airs. > The second rule: Accept both your profits and regrets.

Because migration has been occurring for decades, most are not first generation migrants from the region but are long-term city dwellers. People have been migrating from Appalachia to cities outside the region ever since many of these cities were founded. It was not until the period following World War II, however, that Appalachians became one of the major population groups in these metropolitan centers. During the course of the late 19th and 20th century (the trend slowed since 1970, but continues up to the 2000s), an estimated 40 million people from Appalachia migrated into newer industrial areas of the region (i.e. Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati) and others relocated farther up into urban states of the Northeast, Midwest and the West Coast. In terms of national origin urban Appalachians reflect the varied heritage of the Appalachian region. They are Scots-Irish, English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh. Some are African-American or Native American. Some have German ancestry. Others are descendants of peoples from Central Europe and Southern Europe who were recruited to work in the coal and steel industries. Most Appalachians have a mixture of these heritages. Urban Appalachians are also diverse in terms of the kind of places they lived in before migration. Many came from coal camps in the Cumberland Plateau or Allegheny Mountains. Others came from cities (rural people may moved into them) such as Knoxville; Charleston, West Virginia; the Huntington-Ashland area; or Pittsburgh. Most, however, came from a rural area or small town. Urban Appalachians might be white, black, or Native American, and they might be Protestant, Catholic or Jewish, or possess a sectarian heritage that defies denominational classification. They might be rich or poor, live in the inner city or in an affluent suburb. Most are employed in blue collar and service jobs, but urban Appalachians are also professionals, owners of businesses and managers. Some are artists, engineers, or architects. Many are educators and health care workers. During the period of the nation's industrial expansion the majority worked in factories. More recently work in the service economy is becoming more predominant.See Phillip J. Obermiller and Steven R. Howe. \\"Urban Appalachian and Appalachian Migrant Research in Greater Cincinnati: A Status Report\\" (Urban Appalachian Council Working Paper #16, 2000) at http://uacvoice.org/wp/workingpaper16.html All of this diversity, however, does not mean there is no such thing as an Appalachian heritage. A shared history and the common experience of living in the hills, the towns, the valleys or the foothill sections of the Appalachian region did produce a sense of regional culture that many urban Appalachians celebrate today. The Great Migration Appalachians by the thousands came to the cities under a great variety of circumstances during the 19th and 20th centuries. Early migrants came in trickles one family at a time over many decades. They came in response to specific opportunities such as the opening of a factory. They came during World War I and during the prosperous twenties. They were sometimes recruited to work in a specific factory and, during World War II, thousands of Appalachians came to work in defense plants. Thousands more left the region in response to layoffs in the coal industry. When the mines shut down, some coal towns were entirely depopulated. During the 1950s, special bus runs were made to transport laid off miners and their families to metropolitan areas. It was during this 1940 to 1970 period that entire neighborhoods in the nation's cities became Appalachian, but the foundations of those communities were often laid much earlier in the century. The period from 1940 to 1970 is often referred to as \\"The Great Migration\\".Phillip J. Obermiller, Thomas E. Wagner, and E. Bruce Tucker, eds., Appalachian Odyssey: Historical Perspectives on the Great Migration (Praeger, 2000). Forming communities For many Appalachians, factory work was what attracted them to urban areas ‚Äî Wright Aeronautical (later General Electric), Armco (later AK Steel), U.S. Shoe, General Motors, Chrysler, Frigidaire, Ford, Champion Paper, Nutone, National Cash Register (now NCR Corporation), Delco, and Newport Steel, to name a few. These and many other factories large and small drew people to the cities from Appalachia. The location of these factories often determined the location of Appalachian neighborhoods. Concentrations of low cost housing became temporary \\"ports of entry\\" for some families and long term homes for others. Layoffs, changeovers, plant shutdowns and long stretches of unemployment were common experiences. Some faced discrimination in hiring or in their search for housing. For some black or white Appalachians, doors to good jobs or good neighborhoods were closed. Banks did not always want to make mortgage loans to Appalachian families in certain areas, and insurance companies often refused them coverage through the practice of redlining. Newcomers would often stay with relatives or friends until they got settled. When the layoffs came people might have to go back to the mountains for a time or \\"double up\\" with relatives in the city. Networks of family and friends were their main support. Soon churches were organized, becoming an additional means of spiritual and material sustenance. As neighborhoods became heavily Appalachian, churches, stores, bars, restaurants, and social clubs were established to serve this population. Promoted by the radio and recording industries, urban Appalachian musicians and singers flourished,. Today, Appalachian festivals in Dayton and Cincinnati draw over 40,000 people annually to celebrate their heritage.For more on Dayton's Mountain Days celebration, see http://www.mountaindays.info/ and for information about Cincinnati's Appalachian Festival see http://www.appalachianfestival.org/index.html As more members of a family migrated and more children were born, family networks with rural roots and urban branches became larger and stronger than before migration. These family networks were flexible and often included non-kin in a network of mutual support, informal education and nurture. Kinship systems and a set of experiences first in the mountains and now in working-class neighborhoods in the city are the core concepts in understanding urban Appalachian social structure. And now that nearly every Appalachian family has members in both rural and urban areas, there is very little difference between rural and urban Appalachians. The major differences among Appalachians are now most likely to appear along class lines.Schwarzweller, Harry K. Schwarzweller, James S. Brown, and J.J. Mangalam. Mountain Families in Transition (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1971). Facing social problems and stereotypes Some family networks were weakened or virtually destroyed by the moves from farm to coal camp to metropolitan area. These weakened families became the concern of social agencies and church-sponsored outreach ministries. Although relatively few of these families became welfare dependent, those few became the basis of the stereotype of the impoverished SAM or \\"southern Appalachian migrant.\\" Newspaper stories about welfare, crime and violence and \\"poverty posters\\" of large, poorly dressed Appalachian families caused many urban Appalachians to disassociate themselves from an open Appalachian identity. Negative stereotypes have caused much suffering among people from Appalachia who have moved to the cities.The best refutation of Appalachian stereotypes can be found in Billings, Norman, and Ledford, eds., Confronting Appalachian Stereotypes: Back Talk from an American Region (University Press of Kentucky, 1999). Thousands of families experienced some form of failure in their efforts to make new lives in the city. Some returned to the Appalachian region, some stayed and experienced the worst of urban poverty. Most have fought the odds and have overcome, although many still await the opportunity to have good schools, good jobs and secure neighborhoods. Advocacy and service organizations such as the Urban Appalachian Council were formed to respond to the needs of this population.Thomas E. Wagner, and Phillip J. Obermiller. Valuing Our Past, Creating Our Future: The Founding of the Urban Appalachian Council (Berea College Press, 1999). Even the strongest families, especially in the inner city, experienced a variety of hardships. Children were ridiculed because of the way they talked, the way they dressed or because of where they lived. Going to school was often just a matter of survival with little education occurring. Unable to cope with the hostile environment of large and bureaucratic urban public schools, generations of inner city Appalachians have had to cope without the benefit of even a high school education.William W. Philliber, and Clyde B. McCoy, eds., The Invisible Minority: Urban Appalachians (University Press of Kentucky, 1981). See also Kathryn M. Borman and Phillip J. Obermiller, eds., From Mountain to Metropolis: Appalachian Migrants in American Cities (Bergin & Garvey, 1994). Creating a neighborhood culture Some researchers have seen urban Appalachians as an emerging ethnic group, forming group cohesion and identity in a fashion similar to earlier \\"urban villagers\\" arriving in our nation's cities.William W. Philliber, Appalachian Migrants in Urban America: Cultural Conflict or Ethnic Group Formation? (Praeger, 1981). Anthropologist Rhoda Halperin describes the culture of an urban Appalachian neighborhood in terms of a set of adaptations Appalachians have made to their circumstances. She sees no distinction between rural Appalachian and urban migrant Appalachians and their descendants. The features of community life produced by their adaptations include \\" . . . everyday practices - caring for children and the elderly, providing work, helping in times of crisis, granting favors, passing along information or lending support.\\" These practices, she says, are embedded in specific neighborhood structures that are old and enduring: the extended family, the church, and the neighborhood as a place that confers working class identity. Halperin identifies the strengths of an integrated working-class neighborhood as strong intergenerational ties, informal educational processes through which adults instruct the young, intricate patterns of exchange that provide food, shelter, and care of dependents, longevity of families in the neighborhood, householding (provisioning) practices, and the gifts of oratory, storytelling, and writing skills.Rhoda H. Halperin, Practicing Community: Class Culture and Power in an Urban Neighborhood (University of Texas Press, 1998); See also Michael E. Maloney, and Christopher Auffrey, \\"Appalachian Cincinnati\\" ch. 5 in The Social Areas of Cincinnati: An Analysis of Social Needs. http://www.socialareasofcincinnati.org/report/Chapter5.html A balanced view of urban Appalachians needs to include the ravages that decades of industrialization, out-migration, deindustrialization, and deterioration of core city neighborhoods have wreaked on some. But one should never stereotypically confuse the negative adaptations and pathologies that affect a minority of people from the mountains with all Appalachians. Appalachian culture does not cause poverty, crime, or school failure. Lack of good jobs, decent housing and good schools in safe neighborhoods have condemned millions of Americans of all backgrounds to lives on the margin of society in rural and urban enclaves. Urban Appalachians resent having the poverty stereotypes applied to their group, and rightly so. Every large group which has migrated to American cities has had similar experiences of facing put-downs, prejudice and outright discrimination. Through individual and collective efforts most have been able to raise their socioeconomic status over time. How long it takes the urban Appalachian poor to overcome the handicaps of poverty will depend in part on how the country responds to unemployment, underemployment, poor schooling and other urban ills. The rest depends on urban Appalachians' ability to use the strengths of their heritage and adapt once again to economic shifts such as production jobs going overseas. Making a contribution Most urban Appalachians have benefited in many ways from the move to the city, both economically and socially. Midwestern cities are home to thousands of practicing musicians, craftspeople, storytellers, poets, writers, and other artists. Appalachians have contributed to the civic, economic and cultural life of their communities serving as ministers, elected officials, union leaders, and in thousands of small businesses.Chad Berry, Southern Migrants, Northern Exiles. (University of Illinois Press, 2000). A positive view of rural and urban Appalachians can be found in Jeff Biggers, The United States of Appalachia: How Southern Mountaineers Brought Independence, Culture, and Enlightenment to America. (Shoemaker & Hoard, 2006). For the most part urban Appalachians are not rich and famous. They placed the welfare of their families and neighbors above their own advancement, moving up pretty much together or not at all. They are the men and women who made the refrigerators, assembled the automobiles, made paper boxes, and a thousand other products, and hauled them over the road in tractor trailers. They built bridges and highways. They made airplane engines and rocket components. They built churches and sometimes neighborhoods. Some longed for home as they saw their children and grandchildren grow up in the city or in suburban towns or in trailer parks. Some were glad to escape the hills in favor of greater opportunities in the city. All helped shape the life and culture of American cities in the last half of this century. Is there anything unique about the experience of urban Appalachians? Perhaps, but the experience of this group is probably more remarkable in its similarity to that of other ethnic groups shaped by mass migrations, such as the Irish, Italian, German and African American communities. The processes of migration, community formation and long-term adjustment are similar in many ways. However, inner city white Appalachians now share with underemployed African-Americans and black Appalachians the tragedies and challenges of living in the post- industrial metropolis. Finding solutions in the form of jobs, good schools, decent housing, safe neighborhoods and other support for family and community life remains their greatest challenge.

In December 1973, archeologists excavating \\"Tomb Number 3\\" (dated at 168 BCE) discovered an edifying trove of silk paintings and silk scrolls with manuscripts, charts, and maps. These polymathic texts discussed philosophy, politics, medicine, Daoist yoga, Yin and Yang, and astronomy. Most were unknown in the received literature, ranging from a formulary that modern editors entitled Recipes for Fifty-Two Illnesses and two texts on cauterization ‚Äì the Zubi Shiyi Mai Jiujing and Yin Yang Shiyi Mai Jiujing, both precursors of the Huangdi Neijing ‚Äì to the unknown Book of Silk, which lists three centuries of comet sightings. The Mawangdui manuscripts included two silk copies of the Daodejing, eponymously titled \\"Laozi\\". Both add other texts and both reverse the received chapter arrangement, giving the Dejing chapters before the Daojing. The so- called \\"B Version\\" included four previously unknown works, each appended with a title and number of characters (Â≠ó): #Jing Fa (Á∂ìÊ≥ï \\"The Constancy of Laws\\"), 5000 characters #Shi Da jing (ÂçÅÂ§ßÁ∂ì \\"The Ten Great Classics\\"), 4564 #Cheng (Á®± \\"Aphorisms\\"), 1600 #Dao Yuan (ÈÅìÂéü \\"On Dao the Fundamental\\"), 464 Due to textual lacunae, that is gaps in the written text due to the fragmentary preservation of the original ancient silk manuscripts, the original character counts are also uncertain.

Tang was first to identify these texts as the \\"Huangdi sijing\\", a no-longer extant text attributed to the Yellow Emperor, which the Hanshu's Yiwenzhi (ËóùÊñáÂøó) bibliographical section lists as a Daoist text in four pian (ÁØá \\"sections\\"). The \\"Huangdi sijing\\" was lost and is only known by name, and thus the Daoist Canon excluded it. While most scholars agree with Tang's evidence, some disagree and call the texts the Huang-Lao boshu or the Huangdi shu (ÈªÉÂ∏ùÊõ∏ \\"The Yellow Emperor's books\\"). The first complete English translation of the Huangdi sijing was produced by Leo S. Chang (appended in Yu 1993:211-326). Subsequent translations include scholarly versions by Yates (1997) and by Chang and Feng (1998), as well as some selected versions. Ryden (1997) provides an informative examination of \\"The Yellow Emperor's Four Canons\\". Philosophical significance The Huangdi sijing reveals some complex connections within Chinese philosophy. Take, for example, the first lines in \\"The Constancy of Laws\\": > The Way generates standards. Standards serve as marking cords to demarcate > success and failure and are what clarify the crooked and the straight. > Therefore, those who hold fast to the Way generate standards and do not to > dare to violate them; having established standards, they do not dare to > discard them. [Missing graph] Only after you are able to serve as your own > marking cord, will you look at and know all-under-Heaven and not be deluded. > (Dao fa, 1.1, tr. De Bary and Lufrano 2001:243) This passage echoes concepts from several rival philosophies, Daoism, Legalism, Mohism, Confucianism, and School of Names. De Bary and Lufrano (2001:242) describe Huangdi sijing philosophy as \\"a syncretism that is grounded in a cosmology of the Way and an ethos of self-cultivation\\". \\"Prior to the Mawangdui discovery,\\" says Peerenboom (1993:1), \\"sinologists were more confused than clear about the school of thought known as Huang-Lao.\\" Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian says many early Han thinkers and politicians favored Huang-Lao doctrines during the reigns (202-157 BCE) of Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing, and Empress Dou. Sima cites Han Fei, Shen Buhai, and Shen Dao as representative Huang-Lao philosophers, advocates that sagely rulers should use wu wei to organize their government and society. However, after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) declared Confucianism the official state philosophy, Huang-Lao followers dwindled and their texts largely vanished. The Huangdi sijing texts provide newfound answers to questions about how Chinese philosophy originated. Carrozza (2002:49) explains that, \\"For a long time, the focal point in the study of early Chinese thought has been the interpretation of a rather limited set of texts, each attributed to a 'Master' and to one of the so-called 'Hundred Schools'.\\" For instance, tradition says Mozi founded Mohism and his students compiled the Mozi text. Conversely, Mawangdui textual syncretism reveals \\"the majority of the ancient texts\\" are not written by individual authors, \\"but rather collections of works of different origins.\\" References *Carrozza, Paola. 2002. \\"A Critical Review of the Principal Studies on the Four Manuscripts Preceding the B Version of the Mawangdui Laozi,\\" B.C.

Edmund Gasseau Choteau Le Guerrier (1840‚Äì1921), of American and Cheyenne parentage, was a survivor of the Sand Creek massacre in 1864. He was an interpreter for the U.S. government during the Indian Wars between the Cheyenne and the United States, and later became a successful rancher. Early life Guerrier was born January 16, 1840 in a Cheyenne camp on the Smoky Hill River in what is now the state of Kansas. His father William Guerrier, an American of French descent born in 1812 in St. Louis, Missouri, was then employed by the fur trader William Bent of Bent's Fort; his mother was Tah-tah-tois-neh (Walks In SightNational Archives #368 Edward Guerrier), a Cheyenne of Little Rock's Wutapai band. In 1848, his father left William Bent's employ and, in partnership with Seth Edmund Ward, became a licensed trader in the region of the Upper Platte and Arkansas rivers, eventually operating a trading post along the Platte with his partners.Hardorff 2006, p. 50. Guerrier's mother and an infant sibling died in an 1849 cholera epidemic. In 1851 Guerrier was entered in a Catholic mission school near present-day St. Marys, Kansas, and later enrolled in St. Louis University. After his father's death in 1857, Guerrier withdrew from the university and eventually returned to live with his mother's people, who knew him as Red Tail Hawk. He narrowly escaped death in the Sand Creek massacre in 1864. Indian Wars Guerrier married George Bent's sister JuliaGrinnell, p. 20. in about 1865. He worked as an interpreter for the Interior Department and was present in that capacity at the negotiations for the Treaty of the Little Arkansas of 1865. After a stint as a trader for licensed arms dealer David A. Butterfield, he was hired as an interpreter by the War Department, assigned to the Seventh U.S. Cavalry and played a crucial role during the spring 1867 Hancock expedition under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.Hardorff 2006, p. 51. In August 1868 he was living with Little Rock's band on Buckner's Fork of the Pawnee River when he learned of the violent raids by a large war party on white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers in Kansas; he later gave an affidavit to the U.S. military identifying the men responsible for the raids.Guerrier, Edmund. (1869-02-09). Affidavit. In U.S. House of Representatives 1870 , pp. 167. Reproduced in Hardorff 2006, pp. 52-53. In October 1867 he was an interpreter during negotiations for the Medicine Lodge Treaty. In 1869 he interpreted for the Fifth U.S. Cavalry under Maj. Gen. Eugene A. Carr, and afterward worked as a trader at Camp Supply for the firm of Lee and Reynolds. He again worked for the Interior Department in 1871 and 1884, interpreting for Cheyenne delegations to Washington, D.C. Geary Edmund Guerrier died in 1921 at his ranch near the city of Geary, Oklahoma which was named after him; as Guerrier was difficult for non-French-speakers to pronounce or spell it became Geary.Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture Retrieved 2014-12-02.

Biography Charles performs jump blues music with his group Ezra Charles' Texas Blues Band (formerly Ezra Charles and the Works) in and around the Houston area. His group is unusual as it does not employ an upright or electric bass. Instead, Charles plays the bass notes via a MIDI device in his piano, which produces a bass note for every piano key played below the \\"E\\" below middle \\"C\\". In addition to Charles' piano/bass, the group contains a guitar, drums, and a three-piece horn section. Hailing now from Beaumont, Texas, Charles is the author of a song called \\"Beaumont Boys\\", which pays homage to many of the famous musicians from his hometown, including The Big Bopper, Johnny and Edgar Winter, and Harry James.

He is best known for his work in anti-war and gay rights advocacy.  Early life David Benjamin Mixner was born on August 16, 1946, and grew up in the small town of Elmer, New Jersey.Mixner, David. \\"Turkey Hollow Almanac: My Birthday\\", DavidMixner.com, August 17, 2008. Accessed April 28, 2015. His father Ben worked on a corporate farm, and his mother Mary worked shifts at a local glass factory and later took a job as a bookkeeper for the local John Deere dealership. David has two older siblings, Patsy Mixner Annison and Melvin Mixner. Mixner attended Daretown Elementary School, then Woodstown High School, where he got involved in the Civil Rights Movement, by participating in picketing and sending his own money to Martin Luther King Jr. In his bestselling memoir, Stranger Among Friends, Mixner explains that his parents were \\"livid\\" over his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, claiming his activism embarrassed them. When Mixner told them he wanted to go south during the summer of 1963 after following the events in Birmingham, Alabama, his parents forbade him.Mixner, D. (1996) Stranger Among Friends. New York: Bantam Books.  Career = College and early activism  In the fall of 1964, Mixner enrolled at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, where he soon became heavily involved in civil rights and anti-war activism, including helping to organize protests against a speech by General William Westmoreland. Prompted by an article he read in The Arizona Republic about city garbage workers who were seeking the right to unionize, in the fall of 1966, Mixner organized from start to finish the first of many protests he would organize over the next thirty years. Mixner rallied hundreds of workers, students and professors and led a march on City Hall. Although the city successfully broke the strike, the workers eventually earned the right to unionize. Mixner also experienced his first same-sex relationship at ASU, with a man whom he refers to as Kit in his memoirs. A year into their relationship, Kit was killed in an automobile accident. Mixner did not attend the funeral, and Kit's parents never discovered that their son was gay. Soon after Kit's death, Mixner decided to transfer to the University of Maryland in order to be closer to Washington, D.C., where he would be able to get more involved in anti-war protests. Mixner found himself much more interested in activism than in pursuing a college degree. While at Maryland, Mixner was a grassroots organizer for the 1967 march on the Pentagon, which was later captured in Norman Mailer‚Äôs Armies of the Night.  McCarthy presidential campaign  Later that year, Mixner dropped out of college and began working for the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy. One of Mixner's first assignments was organizing the Minnesota operation, helping McCarthy win the Minnesota caucus, defeating incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson. Later, Mixner and other members of McCarthy's campaign team went to Georgia to help select an alternative delegation to send to the national convention in Chicago, challenging Governor Lestor Maddox's hand-picked delegation, which included only seven African-Americans in the 117 person delegation. The Georgia Democratic Party Forum, which sought to challenge Maddox's delegation, held its own convention in Macon, where Congressman John Conyers (D‚ÄìMI) keynoted their convention before turning over the floor to Julian Bond, the first African-American elected to the Georgia legislature, who would later become Chairman of the NAACP. At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mixner was beaten by police during the protests held outside the convention center. After Humphrey claimed the nomination, Mixner began seeking out new outlets for his activism. He soon befriended Doris Kearns Goodwin, who introduced Mixner to Senator Ted Kennedy, who would become a lifelong friend.  Democratic Party Delegate Selection Committee  In early 1969, Mixner was invited to join the Delegate Selection Committee, which had been created during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Although Mixner's appointment turned out to be a mistake, as Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma was supposed to invite Mixner to join the less powerful Rules Committee, he nonetheless made his mark on the twenty-eight member body, which included Warren Christopher, who would later become Secretary of State, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, Senator Harold Hughes of Iowa, Senator Adlai Stevenson III of Illinois and Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, who served as the Committee's Chairman.‚ÄúDemocrats Name 2 Reform Groups‚Äù. The New York Times, February 9, 1969. By virtue of his inadvertent inclusion on the Delegate Selection Committee, Mixner served as his generation's lone voice, and he intended to use the platform to raise the issue of the violence at the previous year's convention. When Senator Kennedy, a close friend of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and the party's front-runner for the 1972 Presidential nomination, took the witness stand, Mixner used the opportunity to ask Kennedy if he would publicly condemn both the tactics used by the Chicago police and the Mayor for his involvement. Kennedy dodged the question. Subsequently, Adlai Stevenson III sought to exclude Mixner from a committee meeting in Chicago where Mayor Daley was scheduled to testify. McGovern called Mixner, asking him not to attend, but Mixner refused. When he arrived for the meeting, drawing the ire of Senator Stevenson, McGovern offered him a compromise, promising to ask Daley to apologize for the violence and offer all those arrested amnesty if Mixner agreed to stay quiet. The resulting exchange between McGovern and Daley, included Daley's insistence that \\"If people violate the law they should accept the consequences of the law.\\"\\"M'Govern and Daley Clash at Hearing\\". The New York Times, June 8, 1969. The McGovern Commission, which had set out to reform the Presidential nomination process in order to avoid a repeat of the 1968 Convention, eventually issued its recommendations, including the requirement that all delegates be directly elected by the people, eviscerating the power of political bosses to control the nomination process.  The Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam  Mixner's most significant contribution to the anti-Vietnam War effort was his role as one of the head organizers of the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. The idea was prompted by Jerome Grossman, a Massachusetts businessman active in the peace movement. Grossman proposed to Sam Brown, a close friend of Mixner, that they set aside a day in 1969 where ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù would come to a halt, essentially engaging in a strike against everything. Brown decided that the word ‚Äúmoratorium‚Äù would be less threatening than ‚Äústrike‚Äù to middle-class Americans, and set to work, setting aside October 15, 1969 as the day of the moratorium. Brown soon enlisted the help of Mixner, David Hawk, another young activist, and Marge Sklencar, who they knew from the McCarthy campaign. Brown, Mixner, Hawk and Sklencar then set about organizing the event. In September 1969, shortly before the Moratorium, Mixner headed to Martha's Vineyard to meet with fellow activists, many of whom had also worked on the McCarthy campaign. Among those in attendance was Bill Clinton, who had been invited by one of Mixner's friends. At the time, Clinton was studying at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, attending the Martha's Vineyard retreat with fellow Rhodes Scholars Rick Stearns and Strobe Talbott. Mixner and Clinton were fast friends, and Mixner would play a significant role twenty-three years later in getting the LGBT community to support Clinton. As the date of the Moratorium approached, it began gathering a great deal of momentum, with Time, Life, and Newsweek magazines featuring it in cover stories. When Clinton subsequently visited the headquarters of the Moratorium and saw what he would be missing by being in London on October 15, he suggested to Mixner that he organize a parallel protest at Oxford. This protest, in which about a thousand people gathered in front of the American embassy in London, would later be a significant issue in his presidential campaign, with President George H. Bush telling Larry King on CNN in October 1992, \\"Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but to go to a foreign country and demonstrate against your own country when your sons and daughters are dying halfway around the world, I am sorry but I think that is wrong.\\"Kelly,Michael. \\"The 1992 Campaign\\". The New York Times, Oct. 9. 1992. The Moratorium drew millions of people throughout the country, who gathered in public places and read the names of the soldiers killed in Vietnam aloud. The day was capped off by a march at the Washington Monument, where Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke about her late husband's passion for ending the war.  Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles (MECLA)  In 1976, Mixner began the process of coming out of the closet, and soon thereafter was a founding member of the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles (MECLA), the nation's first gay and lesbian Political Action Committee. At the time, very few candidates were willing to accept donations from openly gay individuals or gay-affiliated organizations. At the time, Mixner was also serving as the campaign manager for Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles who was seeking reelection, so while he worked to raise funds for MECLA, his involvement was kept secret because of the potential for his sexuality to become an issue in Bradley's campaign.  \\"NO on 6\\" campaign  Soon after Bradley won reelection easily, Mixner turned his focus to fighting Proposition 6, an initiative placed on the California ballot by Orange County State Senator John Briggs that would make it illegal for gays and lesbians to be schoolteachers. Similar initiatives had recently passed throughout the country when Mixner turned his focus to fighting Proposition 6, creating the ‚ÄúNO on 6‚Äù organization to fight it; through the process, he would publicly come out of the closet. Mixner and his lover Peter Scott secured a meeting with then-Governor Ronald Reagan, whom they convinced to oppose the initiative publicly. As a result, and through the work of Mixner, Scott, legendary gay rights activist and San Francisco City Councilman Harvey Milk, and others, Proposition 6 was defeated by over a million votes, the first ballot initiative of its sort to be shot down. As a result of this huge success, Mixner and Scott experienced a huge upturn in business for their fledgling political consulting firm, Mixner/Scott, and were asked by Bill Clinton, then running for governor of Arkansas, to host a reception for Clinton at their Los Angeles home.  The Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament  In late 1984, after years of devastation in his personal life resulting from the AIDS crisis, Mixner decided to focus his energy on combating nuclear proliferation, creating an organization named PRO Peace. Mixner envisioned finding five thousand Americans who would take a year out of their lives to walk across America to advocate for disarmament, holding rallies throughout the country. The Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, which Mixner would later call his ‚Äúbiggest political failure and [his] biggest regret‚Äù ultimately left Los Angeles on March 1, 1986 with only 1200 marchers. Mixner would spend many years paying the consequences, which included fighting lawsuits and paying employment taxes for his employees. The lore of the march lives on, however, immortalized in songs, books, and film.  AIDS activism  Shortly after Mixner experienced professional success in 1985, helping defeat Proposition 64, a ballot initiative proposed by Lyndon LaRouche that would require quarantining people with AIDS, Mixner learned that his long-time lover and business partner, Peter Scott, had AIDS. Scott would fight the disease for four years; he died on May 13, 1989. While Scott fought the disease, Mixner formed an organization that spearheaded legislation that would create a California alternative to the FDA, enabling California to deal more aggressively with the AIDS epidemic than the federal government. Mixner's group enlisted the support of California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, then convinced Governor George Deukmejian to sign AB 1952, which, as described by van de Kamp, ‚Äúmandates the director of DHS to implement the drug testing and sale authority that he had under existing law, for the purpose of approving the testing and sale either of an AIDS vaccine, or of new drugs that offer a reasonable possibility of treating people who have been infected with the AIDS virus.‚Äù  Clinton campaign and \\"Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell\\"  Four years after a fundraiser for the Dukakis campaign told Mixner that Governor Dukakis would not accept the million dollars Mixner and his friends planned to raise for him, Mixner found hope in the candidacy of his old friend, Bill Clinton. After Clinton promised Mixner that he would support both an end to the ban on gays in the military and increased funds to find a cure for AIDS, Mixner began raising money for Clinton enthusiastically. Mickey Kantor, Clinton's campaign chairman, soon asked Mixner to join the National Executive Committee of the Clinton for President campaign, the first openly gay person to become a public face of a presidential campaign. After Clinton was elected, Mixner helped with the transition team, though he publicly declared that he would not seek an appointment with the new administration. Although he spoke at an event at the inaugural ball, introduced by his old friend Ted Kennedy, Mixner soon thrust himself in the middle of the furor over the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù policy proposed by Clinton, which represented a total betrayal to Mixner and many in the gay community. When Mixner went on Nightline to complain about Clinton's rapid shift away from allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, his calls to the White House stopped being returned and his consulting business began to tank, as he was no longer perceived as someone who had influence with the new administration.Romano, L. \\"The Reliable Source\\". The Washington Post, April 27, 1993. Shortly thereafter, Mixner participated in a march in Washington for the Campaign for Military Service, which advocated lifting the bans on gays in the military. When Clinton announced the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù policy on July 19, 1993, Mixner organized a march with CMS and was very publicly arrested outside the White House, for which he received a great deal of publicity because of his personal relationship with Clinton.\\"Former Clinton Adviser Arrested in Gay- Rights Protest at White House\\". The Washington Post, July 31, 1993. Mixner and Clinton later healed the rift, but Clinton never again revisited the policy during his presidency.  Writings = Yale David Mixner Collection  On November 3, 2005, the Yale University Library officially created the David Benjamin Mixner collection, which houses his personal collection of books, papers, films and other materials relating to his involvement in civil rights issues.  Turkey Hollow and Return to New York In 2006, Mixner moved to Turkey Hollow in Sullivan County, New York, where he lived in a bright yellow house with his two cats, Sheba and Uganda. In 2009, Mixner moved to Hell's Kitchen in New York City. He posted blog entries daily on his website, davidmixner.com. His home was featured in the Real Estate section of The New York Times in an article entitled \\"Do Ask, Do Tell\\". Mixner was the keynote speaker for the Empire State Pride Agenda's 2007 fall dinner. In October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah Brown honored Mixner with a luncheon at 10 Downing Street. The luncheon in Mixner's honor represented the first time a British Prime Minister honored an LGBT activist in this manor. Also in October 2008, Mixner was invited to debate American politics by the Oxford Union, Britain's second oldest university union. Mixner was featured in Ask Not, a 2008 documentary film about the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. In 2009, Mixner moved back to New York City, where he currently resides near Times Square. In May 2009, Mixner used his blog to call for a March on Washington to protest the LGBT community's lack of equal rights. Cleve Jones, spurred by Mixner's call to march, led the organizational efforts for the National Equality March, scheduled for October 10‚Äì11, 2009. Mixner and Jones both will be featured speakers at a rally in front of the Capitol after the March. Over 200,000 people marched on Washington on October 11, 2009. Mixner was honored by the Point Foundation (LGBT), an organization that provides college scholarships to LGBT students, with its Legend Award at the foundation's 2009 Honors Gala in New York City. The award was presented to Mixner by Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Ted Kennedy. In 2011, the Theater at Dixon Place announced a one-man show starring Mixner, From the Front Porch./https://www.ovationtix.com/trs/pe/8993975 The show is a benefit for Dixon Place and the Ali Forney Center, an organization benefiting LGBT homeless youth. Mixner released a memoir of his time in Turkey Hollow, At Home with Myself: Stories from the Hills of Turkey Hollow, in September 2011. The memoir is published by Magnus Books. Dunes of Overeen In February 2014, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Alan Cumming acquired the rights to Dunes of Overeen, a script written by Mixner and Rich Burns about the true story of gay Dutch artist Willem Arondeus and the Anti-Nazi uprising of artists he led in Amsterdam during World War II. Cumming has indicated he would star in the project, which is seeking a director./http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/alan-cumming-joins- animated- bremen-684034/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/10/entertainment/la-et-mn- alan-cumming-actor-movies-good-wife-salvadaor-dali-macbeth-20130410  The Mixner Trilogy  Mixner created three performances piece that covered his life that has become known as the \\"Mixner Trilogy\\" in the Broadway Community. Among the performers who have appeared in these shows are Tony nominees Bobby Steggert and Rory O'Malley, Emily Swallow (The Mentalist), Chris Bolan (Mamma Mia!), Ryan Silverman (Mamma Mia! and Sideshow), Country Western Singer Chely Wright, Jazz Saxophone great Dave Koz, Will Reynolds (actor/writer), Broadway legend T. Oliver Reid, Megan Ostrahause (Mary Poppins) and others. =Oh Hell No!= On October 27, 2014, David Mixner premiered Oh Hell No! at New World Stages at 340 West 50th Street in New York. The autobiographical show, a one- night-only event to benefit the Point Foundation, featured Mixner revealing intensely personal details about the struggles he had faced, including the pain of losing 300 friends to AIDS in the 1980s. Due to the overwhelmingly positive reception the show received, Mixner was invited to revive the show for performances in Los Angeles and San Francisco in June 2015, with additional cities to follow./http://www.towleroad.com/2014/10/oh-hell- no.html/https://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2015/05/05/david-mixner- legendary-gay-activist-comes-to-la-with-one-man-play/ The stage production made its international debut at the Elfo Puccini Theatre in Milan on April 18, 2016. =1969= Mixner's original play 1969 was staged at the Florence Gould Hall Theater in New York City on March 6, 2017. Mixner took us back to the year 1969 where, along with Sam Brown, David Hawk, and Marge Sklencar, he created the Vietnam Moratorium, which involved protests against the Vietnam War on October 15 and November 15 of that year. Until the Women's March in 2017, it was the largest march in the history of the United States. In 1969, Mixner reveals the deep personal struggle of being a closeted gay man in that time and a blackmail attempt that threatened to out him. In addition, he tells stories about Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, John Dean and others in this amazing production. At the end, Sam Brown and David Hawk joined Mixner on stage, the first time they appeared on a stage together in 47 years. =Who Fell Into The Outhouse?= On March 5, 2018, Mixner performed the last show of his trilogy again to totally sold out audiences. This time Mixner took folks back to his childhood, telling stories of poverty, segregation, murder and rising from the ashes. It was his most personal and vulnerable work of the three productions. The production raised $175,000 for homeless LGBTQ youth. Jacob's Ladder In March 2015, Jacob‚Äôs Ladder, a play written by Mixner and Dennis Bailey, debuted at the Boyd Vance Theatre at the George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center in Austin, Texas. The play, a historical drama set during World War II, concerns a Jewish White House aide's discovery of a secret proposal to bomb Hitler's Concentration Camps in Eastern Europe.

He was a member of the Liberal Party and served in the House of Representatives between 1956 and 1974, representing the Division of Wentworth. He held ministerial office in Coalition governments for nearly a decade, serving as Minister for Air (1961‚Äì1962), Housing (1963‚Äì1966), Labour and National Service (1966‚Äì1969), Treasurer (1969‚Äì1971) and Foreign Affairs (1971). Early life Bury was born in Willesden, London, England, the son of Doris Elma (n√©e Walgrave) and Ernest Bury. His father was an Anglican clergyman. Bury attended Herne Bay College in Kent before matriculating at Queens' College, Cambridge. His education was financed by scholarships and financial assistance from an uncle. He graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1934 and was a member of the Cambridge University Conservative Association. His lecturers at Cambridge included John Maynard Keynes and Joan Robinson, both of whom made a lasting impression. Bury moved to Sydney in December 1935 to work in the economic department of the Bank of New South Wales. He assisted general manager Alfred Charles Davidson during the 1935 Banking Royal Commission. He married Anne Weigall on 23 August 1940, with whom he had four sons. Bury enlisted in the army in 1942, serving with heavy artillery fixed defences and with the 12th Australian Radar Detachment. He worked in the Department of the Treasury in the 1940s and later worked as Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Australian representative on the International Monetary Fund from 1951 to 1956. Political career Bury in 1958. Bury was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1956 Wentworth by-election, following the resignation of Eric Harrison to become High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. According to Peter King, he \\"... would attend football matches with Labor leader Arthur Calwell in Melbourne and ... [shadow Treasurer] Frank Crean stayed at the Bury home in Sydney\\". Menzies Government Bury was appointed Minister for Air and Minister assisting the Treasurer in Robert Menzies' ninth ministry in December 1961. On 27 July 1962 he was sacked for speaking in favour of the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Economic Community, saying that \\"European integration, of which the Common Market is an essential expression, is a keystone of the grand design for Western survival\\". This strongly conflicted with Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen's concerns over its impact on Australian exports to the United Kingdom. In December 1963, he returned to cabinet as Minister for Housing. He introduced the First Home Owners Grant, which continues to be a feature of the Australian political landscape. Holt Government In January 1966, Bury became Minister for Labour and National Service in Harold Holt's first ministry, during the Vietnam War, when he was responsible for implementing conscription. After Holt's disappearance in December 1966, Bury was one of four candidates to contest the Liberal leadership ballot, along with John Gorton, Paul Hasluck, and Billy Snedden. He had some support within the party, including from Peter Howson, and was reportedly Menzies' second most preferred candidate after Hasluck. According to Graham Freudenberg much of his support was due to his status as the only candidate from New South Wales. However, he was virtually unknown among the general public and was not seen as a strong television performer. Bury polled an estimated 16 votes (out of 81) on the first ballot, ahead of only Snedden. Both were eliminated and Gorton went on to defeat Hasluck in the final ballot. Gorton Government Bury remained Minister for Labour and National Service in the first Gorton ministry. With Phillip Lynch as Minister for the Army, a slogan chanted at anti-war protests was \\"lynch Bury and bury Lynch\\". After the 1969 federal election, Bury was promoted to treasurer, his most desired portfolio. His promotion was probably due to his support for Gorton in the 1969 leadership spill, which saw then- treasurer William McMahon challenge for the prime ministership. McMahon was shifted to foreign affairs and Bury took his place as treasurer. Gorton also reputedly viewed Bury as someone who was likely to be compliant and not challenge his own economic agenda. Bury presented only a single budget as treasurer, for 1970‚Äì71. It was described as \\"very much a Treasury-inspired document\\", and also had significant input from Gorton. He was one of the pioneers of the forward estimates system, in March 1971 asking ministers to provide estimates of expenditure for future activities. He was an advocate of alternative measures of economic progress, stating \\"we must not fall too readily to exclusive worship at the altar of GNP [...] our prime concern should always be the social welfare of the community as a whole\\". He was also an early supporter of a broad-based national consumption tax, akin to the current GST. There were concerns about Bury's health during his period as treasurer, with one source describing him as \\"a worn-out and a tired man, suffering from ill-health and lacking concentration\\". He suffered from coronary arteriosclerosis and hypertension. Bury's departmental secretary Dick Randall stated that, from Treasury's perspective, he \\"lost too many cabinet fights\\". He came into conflict with the more experienced figures of Gorton, McEwen, and McMahon who were not always in agreement with the departmental agenda. He opposed the creation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, preferring the use of foreign capital, but was overridden by McEwen and Gorton. McMahon Government When William McMahon became Prime Minister in March 1971, he initially retained Bury as Treasurer, but 12 days later moved him to the Foreign Affairs portfolio, and sacked him in August 1971. He retired from parliament at the 1974 federal election after losing Liberal preselection to Bob Ellicott. Bury was the only Liberal Treasurer who was not and did not subsequently become his party's deputy leader until Joe Hockey. Later life Bury retired from parliament in 1974 due to ill health. In the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1979, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), in recognition of his service to the Parliament of Australia. Bury died in Sydney in 1986 and was survived by his wife Anne and his four sons, Peter, Michael, John and Nicholas.

This is a chronologically ordered list meant to document instances where airliners have been brought down by gunfire or missile attacks, including wartime incidents, rather than terrorist bombings or sabotage. 1930s=Kweilin incident This incident is believed to be the first commercial passenger plane attacked by hostile forces. On 24 August 1938 ‚Äì during the Second Sino-Japanese War ‚Äì the Kweilin, a DC-2 jointly operated by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Pan American World Airways, carrying 18 passengers and crew, was forced down by Japanese aircraft in Chinese territory just north of Hong Kong. 15 people died when the Kweilin, which made an emergency water landing to avoid the attack, was strafed by the Japanese and sunk in a river. The American pilot Hugh L. Woods and two others survived. Three prominent Chinese bankers, Hu Yun, Singloh Hsu, and Wang Yumei, were among the dead. It was later believed to be an assassination attempt on Chinese president Sun Yat- sen's only son, Sun Fo, who was believed by the Japanese to be aboard but missed the flight. The plane was refurbished, renamed the Chungking, and was later involved in a second shootdown incident, in 1940. 1940s=Kaleva OH-ALL Kaleva OH-ALL was a civilian Junkers Ju 52 transport and passenger plane (a Junkers Ju 52-3/mge) operated by the Finnish carrier Aero O/Y, shot down by two Soviet Ilyushin DB-3 bombers on 14 June 1940, while en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Helsinki, Finland.Virtualpilots - Tapauskaleva. Retrieved January 1, 2007. This occurred during the Interim Peace between Finland and the Soviet Union, three months after the end of the Winter War, and a year before the Continuation War began. A few minutes after taking off in Tallinn, Kaleva was intercepted by Soviet DB-3s. The bombers opened fire with their machine guns and badly damaged Kaleva, causing it to ditch in water a few kilometers northeast of Keri Lighthouse. All seven passengers and two crew members on board died.* The Chungking On 29 October 1940, the same DC-2 involved in the previous shootdown incident as Kweilin, now renamed Chungking, operated by CNAC, was destroyed by Japanese fighters at Changyi Airfield, Yunnan, China, after it made a scheduled landing and was coming to a stop. Nine people died, including the American pilot Walter \\"Foxie\\" Kent and Chinese architect Chang-Kan Chien. The plane caught fire and never flew again. 1942 Qantas Short Empire The Corio, a Short Empire flying boat airliner, operated by Qantas, was shot down by Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service aircraft in the early days of the Pacific War during World War II off the coast of West Timor, Dutch East Indies, on 30 January 1942. Thirteen occupants were killed. Captain Aubrey Koch, along with another crewman and three passengers, swam to shore and were rescued. KNILM PK-AFV PK-AFV, also known as the PH-ALP Pelikaan (one of the KLM airliners that diverted during the German invasion of the Netherlands), was a Douglas DC-3 airliner operated by KNILM from 1940. On 3 March 1942, while on a flight from Bandung, Netherlands East Indies, to Broome, Australia, with the well-known KLM captain Ivan Smirnov, the plane was attacked by three Japanese Mitsubishi A6M fighter planes; PK-AFV successfully landed on the beach with damage and an engine fire but was then strafed and the flight engineer and three passengers (including a baby) were killed. Smirnov had a consignment of diamonds, worth at the time an estimated ¬£150,000‚Äì300,000 (in an approximate ¬£‚Äì million), in his possession. The vast majority of these were lost or stolen following the crash. BOAC Flight 777 A scheduled British Overseas Airways Corporation civilian airline flight of a Douglas DC-3 on 1 June 1943 from Lisbon's Portela Airport in neutral Portugal, to Whitchurch near Bristol, England, was attacked by eight German Junkers Ju 88 fighter bombers. It crashed into the Bay of Biscay, resulting in the death of all aboard, including English actor Leslie Howard.Rosevink, Ben and Lt Col Herbert Hintze. \\"Flight 777.\\" FlyPast, Issue No. 120, July 1991. AB Aerotransport SE-BAG Gripen The Douglas DC-3 was attacked by a German Junkers Ju-88 Luftwaffe fighter-bomber over the coast of H√•ll√∂ Island, Sweden on 22 October 1943. The aircraft was flying a scheduled passenger flight from Aberdeen to Stockholm. A ditching at sea was attempted but the aircraft flew against the cliffs and crashed. Of the fifteen occupants two survived, the flight-engineer and a passenger, after they were thrown out of the rear part of the aircraft. 1950s=Cathay Pacific VR-HEU VR- HEU, a Douglas DC-4 airliner operated by Cathay Pacific Airways,ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-54A-10-DC VR-HEU Hainan Island - Aviation Safety Network en route from Bangkok to Hong Kong on 23 July 1954, was shot down by People's Liberation Army Air Force Lavochkin La-7 fighters off the coast of Hainan Island; 10 of the 19 on board died.Accident details - VR-HEU - Plane Crash InfoVR-HEU Account by passenger: Valerie Parish - Major Commercial Airline DisastersVR-HEU - The Life & Times of James Harper El Al Flight 402 El Al Flight 402, a Lockheed L-049 Constellation, registered 4X-AKC, was a passenger flight from Vienna, Austria, to Tel Aviv, Israel, via Istanbul, Turkey, on 27 July 1955. The aircraft strayed into Bulgarian airspace, refused to land, and was shot down by two Bulgarian Air Force MiG-15 jet fighters several kilometers away from the Greek border near Petrich, Bulgaria. All seven crew and fifty-one passengers on board the airliner died. 1960s=1961: United Nations crash A United Nations Douglas DC-6 carrying UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld and 15 others was shot down in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, as Hammarskj√∂ld was traveling to negotiate a cease-fire during the Congo Crisis. The crash was officially blamed on pilot error, but evidence released in 2014 suggested that the plane might have instead been shot down by a Belgian mercenary pilot. 1962: Aeroflot Flight 902 Aeroflot Flight 902 was a Tupolev Tu-104 flight on scheduled domestic service from Khabarovsk to Moscow. On 30 June 1962, its wreckage was found east of Krasnoyarsk Airport, in flat terrain. There were no survivors. An entry hole, with signs of fire damage on the cabin side of the fuselage, was consistent with that which could be caused by an anti-aircraft missile, and there was an unofficial confirmation that an anti-aircraft missile had gone astray during an air defense exercise in the area. 1970s=1973: Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 Libyan Airlines Flight 114 was a regularly scheduled flight from Tripoli, Libya, via Benghazi to Cairo. At 10:30 on 21 February 1973, the Boeing 727 left Tripoli, but became lost due to a combination of bad weather and equipment failure over northern Egypt around 13:44 (local time). It entered Israeli-controlled airspace over the Sinai Peninsula, was intercepted by two Israeli Air Force F-4 Phantom II fighters, refused to land, and was shot down. Of the 113 people on board, five survived, including the co- pilot.http://www.airsafe.com/events/models/b727.htm List of 727 incidents.Aerial intrusions by Civil and Military Aircraft in a Time of Peace.

Vol 107 Winter 1985 Page 288 1975: Mal√©v Flight 240 Mal√©v Flight 240 was a regular service from Budapest Ferihegy International Airport, Hungary, to Beirut International Airport, Lebanon. On 30 September 1975, the aircraft operating the route, a Tupolev Tu-154 of Mal√©v Hungarian Airlines, on its final approach for landing, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea just off the coast of Lebanon. All fifty passengers and ten crew on board are thought to have been killed. No official investigation has ever been conducted on the crash by the Hungarian authorities. The aircraft was allegedly shot down during final approach, probably due to its assumed involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. 1978: Korean Air Lines Flight 902 Korean Air Lines Flight 902 (KAL902, KE902) was a civilian Boeing 707 airliner shot down by Soviet Air Force Sukhoi Su-15 fighters on 20 April 1978, near Murmansk, Soviet Union, after it violated Soviet airspace and failed to respond to Soviet interceptors. Two passengers died in the incident. 107 passengers and crew survived after the plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake. 1978: Air Rhodesia Flight 825 Air Rhodesia Flight 825, was a scheduled flight between Kariba and Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), that was shot down on 3 September 1978, by Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas using a Strela 2 missile. Eighteen of the 56 passengers of the Vickers Viscount survived the crash, but 10 of the survivors were massacred by the guerrillas at the crash site. 1979: Air Rhodesia Flight 827 Air Rhodesia Flight 827 was a scheduled flight between Kariba and Salisbury that was shot down on 12 February 1979, by ZIPRA guerrillas using a Strela 2 missile in similar circumstances to Flight RH825 five months earlier. None of the 59 passengers or crew of the Vickers Viscount survived. 1980s= 1980: Itavia Flight 870  Remains of Itavia Flight 870 at the Museum for the Memory of Ustica, Bologna, Italy On 27 June 1980 a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 operated by Itavia broke up mid-air and crashed into the sea near the Tyrrhenian Sea island of Ustica, while en route from Bologna to Palermo, Italy. All 81 people on board were killed. The cause has been the subject of a decades-long controversy. The aircraft may have been accidentally shot down during a military operation possibly involving United States, French, Italian and Libyan military aircraft. Another theory is that the plane was bombed by terrorists. On 23 January 2013, Italy's top criminal court ruled that there was \\"abundantly\\" clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a missile, but the perpetrators are still missing. 1980: Linhas A√©reas de Angola Yakovlev Yak-40 On 8 June 1980 Linhas A√©reas de Angola airliner registered D2-TYC, a Yakovlev Yak-40, was shot down near Matala, Angola with the loss of all on board (four crew and 15 passengers). ICAO report a sudden situation took place in response to actions by a foreign aircraft and accidentally the Yak-40 was hit and crashed.ICAO Report No. 12/80 Unconfirmed reports mention the possible involvement of a Zambian Shenyang J-6 (MiG-19) fighter. 1983: Korean Air Lines Flight 007 Korean Air Lines Flight 007, also known as KAL 007 or KE007, was a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 civilian airliner shot down by a Soviet Air Force Su-15TM interceptor on 1 September 1983, near Moneron Island just west of Sakhalin Island. 269 passengers and crew, including US congressman Larry McDonald, were aboard KAL 007; there were no survivors. An official investigation concluded that the course deviation was likely caused by pilot error in configuring the air navigation system. 1985: Polar 3 On 24 February 1985, the Polar 3, a Dornier Do 228 research airplane of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, West Germany, was shot down by guerrillas of the Polisario Front over West Sahara. All three crew members died. Polar 3 was on its way back from Antarctica and had taken off in Dakar, Senegal, to reach Arrecife, Canary Islands.Aviation safety network - Report on Polar 3.

The flight plan took it over Mozambique where the Mozambican Civil War was in progress. The aircraft was shot down near the Mozambican town of Ulongwe. The eight passengers and two crew on board died. 1988: Iran Air Flight 655 A missile departs the forward launcher of Vincennes during a 1987 exercise. The forward launcher was also used in the downing of Iran Air 655. Iran Air Flight 655 (IR655) was a commercial flight operated by Iran Air that regularly flew from Bandar Abbas, Iran to Dubai, UAE. On 3 July 1988, toward the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the aircraft was shot down by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes which fired a RIM-66 Standard surface-to-air missile. The airplane was destroyed between Bandar Abbas and Dubai; all 290 passengers and crew died, including 66 children. USS Vincennes was in Iranian waters at the time of the attack. IR655, an Airbus A300 on an ascending flight path, was allegedly misidentified as a descending Iranian F-14.Military Blunders ‚Äì Iran Air Shot Down ‚Äì 3 July 1988. History.com 1988: Ariana Afghan Airlines Shootdown On 19 November 1988 an Antonov An-26 operated by Ariana Afghan Airlines was flying from Kabul, Afghanistan to Jalalabad, Afghanistan when the pilot lost his way.

It was subsequently shot down by ground fire from the Pakistan Air Force near Parachinar, Pakistan resulting in 30 deaths. Ministry of Defence of Pakistan claimed that the aircraft was shot down by ground fire when it entered Pakistani territory and failed to identify itself. 1988: T&G; Aviation DC-7 On 8 December 1988 a Douglas DC-7 chartered by the US Agency for International Development was shot down over Western Sahara by the Polisario Front, resulting in five deaths. Leaders of the movement said the plane was mistaken for a Moroccan Lockheed C-130. The aircraft was on its way to Morocco for a \\"locust control mission\\" there. A second aircraft was also hit, but managed to land at Sidi Ifni, Morocco. 1990s= 1992: Shooting of Armenian plane by the Azerbaijan military  A Yak-40 plane traveling from Stepanakert airport to Yerevan on 27 March 1992, with a total of 34 passengers and crew, was attacked by an Azerbaijani Air Force Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft. With an engine failure and a fire in rear of the plane, it eventually made a safe landing on Armenian territory. 1993: Transair Georgian Airline shootdowns In September 1993, two airliners belonging to Transair Georgia and a third belong to Orbi Georgia were shot down by missiles and gunfire in Sukhumi, Abkhazia, Georgia. The first, a Tupolev Tu-134, was shot down on 21 September 1993 by a missile during landing approach. The second plane, a Tupolev Tu-154, was shot down a day later also during approach. A third one was shelled and destroyed on the ground, while passengers were boarding. 1994: Rwandan presidential airliner The Dassault Falcon 50 airplane carrying Rwandan president Juv√©nal Habyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down as it prepared to land in Kigali, Rwanda, on 6 April 1994. Both presidents died. This double assassination was the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide and the First Congo War. Responsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) or government- aligned Hutu Power extremists opposed to negotiation with the RPF. 1998: Lionair Flight 602 Lionair Flight 602, operated by an Antonov An-24RV, crashed into the sea off the north-western coast of Sri Lanka on 29 September 1998. The aircraft departed Jaffna-Palaly Air Force Base on a flight to Colombo and disappeared from radar screens just after the pilot had reported depressurization. Initial reports indicated that the plane had been shot down by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels. All seven crew and 48 passengers died.Aviation Safety Network.

Two out of four passengers on board were killed, American Christian missionary Roni Bowers and her infant daughter Charity, while the pilot Kevin Donaldson was severely wounded. The incident took place during the Air Bridge Denial Program, when a CIA surveillance plane misidentified the floatplane as involved in drug trafficking and alerted the Peruvian Air Force, resulting in its downing. A year later, the US government paid compensation of $8 million to the Bowers family and the pilot. 2001: Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 On 4 October 2001, Siberian Airlines Flight 1812, a Tupolev Tu-154, crashed over the Black Sea en route from Tel Aviv, Israel to Novosibirsk, Russia. Although the immediate suspicion was of a terrorist attack, American sources proved that the plane was hit by a S-200 surface-to-air missile, fired from the Crimean Peninsula during a Ukrainian military exercise, and this was confirmed by the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee. All on board (66 passengers and 12 crew) died. The President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and several high commanders of the military expressed their condolences to the relatives of the victims. The Ukrainian Government paid out $200,000 in compensation to the families of every passenger and crew who died when the plane crashed. They paid out a total of $15 million in compensation for the accident. 2003: Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident Shortly after takeoff from Baghdad on 22 November 2003, an Airbus A300-200F cargo plane registered OO-DLL, was struck on the left wing by a surface-to-air missile whilst en route to Muharraq, Bahrain. The aircraft lost all hydraulic control meaning the crew had to use engine thrust control to manoeuvre the plane. Despite no controls, a high landing speed and a damaged left wing, the plane touched down at Baghdad airport. Seconds after touch down OO-DLL went off runway due to lack of controls. All 3 people on board survived. The plane's position was last reported in 2011 as still being at Baghdad airport. 2007: Balad aircraft crash On 9 January 2007, an Antonov An-26 crashed while attempting a landing at Balad Air Base in Iraq.

Acad. Real de Historia, MS. Canso d'Antioca, f. 6v The Canso d'Antioca was a late twelfth-century Occitan epic poem in the form of a chanson de geste describing the First Crusade up to the Siege of Antioch (1098). It survives only in a manuscript fragment of 707 alexandrines preserved in Madrid.Sweetenham, 2.Mac√©, 145. The Canso was a reworking of an earlier Occitan epic history of the First Crusade written by one Gregory Bechada and commissioned by Bishop Eustorge of Limoges probably between 1106 and 1118.Paterson, 84. Being based partially on eyewitness testimony, the Canso serves as a source in its own right for the Occitan contribution at Antioch.Sweetenham, 79. It emphasises the feats of the knights of southern France, especially Gouffier de Lastours, and southern Italy, the Italo-Normans under Bohemond of Taranto. It is sometimes supposed to have also dealt extensively with Raymond IV of Toulouse, but he is not found in the surviving fragments. The Canso also served as the literary model for the early thirteenth-century Chanson de la Croisade Albigeoise of William of Tudela and for the late thirteenth-century History of the War of Navarre of William Anelier.Sweetenham, 4.Mac√©, 146.

It opened in 1876 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, the first public institution of higher education in that state. In 1963, the Texas Legislature renamed the school to Texas A&M; University to reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings. The letters \\"A&M;\\" no longer have any explicit meaning but are retained as a link to the university's past. As a Senior Military College, Texas A&M; is one of three public universities with a full-time, volunteer Corps of Cadets. It provides more commissioned officers to the United States Armed Forces than any other school outside the service academies. Texas A&M; University's history as an all-male military institution has led to a unique traditions and terminology. Some phrases come from traditions that include Aggie Bonfire and the athletics program. Other phrases are locations and landmarks around the campus.

Several other land grant schools use \\"Aggie\\", such as New Mexico State and UC Davis.

Another reason why Aggies use \\"former students\\" is that it is felt that \\"alumni\\" implies that graduates are \\"ex-Aggies\\".

Bender's investigation According to Bender, in the Autumn of 1967 he was requested to investigate disturbances in Adam's legal offices which reportedly occurred only on weekends. It was claimed that lighting fixtures exploded, swung back and forth or had their bulbs removed, heavy office furniture was shifted, and copier fluid leaked from the office copier. Additionally, the staff denied having made a large number of outgoing calls to a correct time service that were charged to the firm's telephone company account. The electric company reported evidence of malfunctions due to substantial surges in the power system, and Bender alleges that unspecified tests were made by physicists Friedbert Karger and Gerhard Zicha who reported that \\"some unknown form of energy is at work.\\" Bender claimed that a heavy filing cabinet was reported to have been pushed across the floor by an invisible force, and that a framed painting was captured on film \\"rotating around its hook.\\" Calling her \\"a typical poltergeist\\", Bender believed that the emotional unhappiness of Annemarie Schaberl, a young secretary at the firm, was \\"converted into psychokinesis.\\" He said that Schaberl told him she was frustrated with her job and distressed over a broken marriage engagement. According to Bender, the alleged poltergeist activity ceased when Schaberl left the law firm and was married. Criticism In April 1970 a story in the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that co-authors Albin Neumann (Allan), Herbert Schiff, and Gert Gunther Kramer suggested in their book \\"Falsche Geister, echte Schwindler?\\" (\\"False spirits, real swindlers?\\") that the claims of unexplained disturbances initially made by Adam were fraudulent. The authors wrote that they visited Adam's law offices and discovered nylon threads attached to office fixtures such as overhead lights and wall plates that, when pulled, would cause the fixtures to move, and concluded that \\"the public had been tricked by tricks.\\" Adam reportedly filed a legal injunction to stop publication of the book, which was not granted, and further hearings were scheduled in the District Court of Traunstein. Dutch journalist and skeptic Piet Hein Hoebens has criticized Bender's investigation claims of the Rosenheim Poltergeist, saying that \\"No full report of the investigations has ever been published, so we are in no position to check to what extent the parapsychologists have been successful in excluding naturalistic explanations.\\" Hoebens wrote that Bender's accounts of his investigation show that he may not have made a rigorous enough examination of the evidence, which Hoebens deems highly questionable. According to Hoebens: > \\"Worse is that Bender omits from his account the highly significant fact > that Annemarie was caught in fraud by a policeman. Neither does he mention > the inconclusive but curious discoveries reported by the Viennese magician > Allan after a visit to the Rosenheim office during the poltergeist outbreak. > He states that it was possible to capture a \\"phenomenon\\" (a painting turning > around \\"120 degrees\\" -- that is 200 degrees less than was claimed in > Bender's first report!) on Ampex film. He does not tell us why persons who > know something of the background of that incident refuse to be impressed > with this piece of evidence.\\" Hoebens also criticized Bender's stated beliefs in the paranormal as \\"incompatible with scientific inquiry.\\" The physicist John Taylor wrote that it was likely the measurements shown by the chart recorder used to record the output of the electric current meter in Adam's law offices were fraudulently produced and the explanation for the alleged poltergeist phenomena was a mixture of \\"expectation, hallucination and trickery.\\"Taylor, John (1980). Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician. Temple Smith. pp. 107-108. \\"The electric current meter used during the disturbances recorded strong deflections which, however, were mechanically made. The record was \\"in the form of a loop\\" and looked as it had been made mechanically; the recording paper was even torn, the recording needle having been pressed down with some force. Since the deflections were not actually observed in the process of being recorded, it is not possible to say how they were made. But a human hand seems most likely... The only possible explanation left open to us in this whole poltergeist phenomenon is that of a mixture of expectation, hallucination and trickery.\\" Literature * Herbert Schiff, Albin Neumann, Gert Gunther Kramer, 1969: Falsche Geister, echte Schwindler?.

Further explanation Memory will be best when the processes engaged in during encoding match those engaged in during retrieval. Transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) argues that to have memory successfully recalled there needs to be a successful encoding process. There has been an argument among cognitive psychologists that suggests that the encoding process and retrieval processes are substantially similar. In an experiment that tested TAP researchers found this argument to be true. They found that successful memory retrieval backs up the encoding process, which therefore has a similar effect on both the retrieval and encoding function. This experiment also pointed out that there are certain variables to consider when looking at TAP because they greatly limit the effectiveness of the retrieval and encoding processes. They believed that to change TAP into a broader form, you would have to question whether the two processing forms actually coincide. Also, TAP is an information-processing action that occurs in two stages; the first includes the procedures that should manipulate the information that coincides with the task activity, and the second stage focuses on the experience that the task activity created. Meaning, that we do not process stimuli all at one time, but instead break it down into a series of responses. History: the beginnings * Dr. Fergus I. M. Craik was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on April 17, 1935. Craik is one of the leading psychologists behind the idea of memory. After attending medical school at the age of 18, Craik found that that was not his true passion. He dropped out of medical school and started studying psychology. He became interested in memory because it was his thesis for graduate school at the University of Liverpool in 1960. Craik's work is heavily influenced by Dr. Treisman's work with information processing. After moving to Toronto, he started working on his now famous paper with Dr. Bob Lockhart explaining \\"Levels of Processing.\\" Craik went on to work with Dr. Endel Tulving also. * Dr. Endel Tulving was born in Estonia on May 26, 1927. At the age of 17, Tulving knew he was interested in pursuing psychology, especially the area of mind and behavior. In 1949, he went to study psychology at the University of Toronto. Tulving went on to gain his PhD from Harvard University after receiving his Honor's and master's degrees in psychology at the University of Toronto. After Harvard, Tulving went back to teach at the University of Toronto. It was there that he met and made history with Craik for their work with memory. In 1972, Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S. Lockhart completed studies that went against the idea of multistore theories and were in favor of levels of processing when it comes to the human memory. Craik and Lockhart's studies were some of the first studies completed dealing with Transfer-Appropriate Processing, which is now popular because of their ideas. Craik and Lockhart explained that the theory of multistore had very little evidence when it came to capacity, coding and retention. Instead, they proposed that memory involves level of processing. They concluded that we are always building from what we already know through our senses, patterns, and stimulus. Craik and Lockhart completed 10 experiments where participants processed different words by answering questions about them. Depending on the word, the response could be shallow or deep. After this section of the experiment was complete, participants were asked to randomly recall words. They were able to conclude that participants remembered positive and deeper responses more easily. Next, Craik continued his work with Endel Tulving in 1975. They tested subjects individually for perception and speed. Participants had a word revealed to them for 200 ms. through a tachistoscope. Before exposure, questions were asked about the word. These questions were meant to create shallow or deep reactions about the words for the participants. After this was complete, the participants were then asked questions about the words. After these random questions, the participants were asked to recall the words. It was assumed that deeper level questions would be recalled more often. Through four separate experiments, Craik and Tulving found this to be true. Experiments This phenomenon has been shown by various experiments: * One example of this is empirically shown, specifically, in a study by Morris and associates (1977) using semantic and rhyme tasks. In a standard recognition test, memory was better following semantic processing compared to rhyme processing (the levels-of-processing effect). However, in a rhyming recognition test, memory was better for those who engaged in rhyme processing compared to semantic processing. * Another experiment done by Haline E. Schendan and Marta Kutas present the neurophysiological evidence for transfer appropriate processing. They verified that memory is best recalled when the situations are very similar to one another. In this experiment two different studies were done. The event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded as a means for information during a memory test. According to this specific study as well as other transfer-appropriate processing accounts, there will be significantly more memory recalled when things are continually grouped together on a perceptual level. Kutas and Schendan showed that there is neurophysiological evidence that if the correct transfer processing of study takes place, then the test experiences will show a difference in memory reactivation. This will occur even if there are some small visual differences within the setting. * One experiment done by Patricia A. deWinstanley and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork also shows evidence for transfer appropriate processing. Two different tests were done within this experiment and their objective was to prove multifactor transfer appropriate processing of generation effects. Within this experiment they also focused on the fact that not all of our processing is compatible with one another, and they also hypothesized that comprehending and reading are different in regards to where the individuals' resources are used in the act of processing. The results showed new and truthful evidence for the multifactor transfer appropriate processing model. They also proved the limited processing assumption mentioned earlier; in which states that our processing of one type of information is not always compatible with a differing type of information. This was shown in the cued-recall test in Experiment 2. Once we switch to another information type, our processing may become slow or even stopped. However, when processing the same type of information, our comprehension can increase. * Another great experiment done with transfer appropriate processing was one by Michael E. Stiso. It dealt with the role of TAP (transfer-appropriate processing) in the effectiveness of decision-support graphics. The tasks that were presented during the experiment were relatable to real-world tasks done by people each day. The individuals were placed into an air traffic control simulator. During some of the trials, they had decision-support graphics to show things that normally are processed cognitively, such as altitude. The hypothesis behind this experiment is that the individual will process information completely differently when these graphics are present versus when they aren't present. Also, the individual's performance should be the best when they are either shown the graphics during all of their trials or when they aren't shown them at all. It is predicted that the precipitants will perform the worst when they are shown the graphics in some of the trials but not in others. Within this experiment, the thought behind transfer-appropriate processing is that one's ability to remember depends on the length of the overlap in differing types of processing. If an individual has a great amount of overlap in processing, then memory will most likely be greater. * Finally, an experiment that shows the effects of Transfer-appropriate Processing is one done by Jeffery J, Franks, Carol W. Bilbrey, Khoo Guatlien, and Timothy P, McNamara. Once again, TAP is interconnected with memory. In this specific study, transfer-appropriate processing is analyzed with its effects on first and second exposure to various items, and it is shown throughout 13 experiments. The idea that individuals will perform better on tasks that they have had previous exposure to is one of the main forums behind TAP. Problems Although this theory has many experiments backing up its reliability, many researchers are questioning the levels of processing that TAP seems to fall into. The levels of processing have been under speculation for the fact that they seem untestable and unfalsifiable. They argue that these processing effects are \\"circular\\" in the sense that deep processing can be considered as just better remembering. They believe that much of the questionability of the processing effects lies between the encoding specificity principle and TAP. The researchers argue that these processing systems function much like Darwin's natural selection theory in that the \\"fitness\\" of a species and the \\"depth of processing\\" in the levels of processing cannot fully predict the final outcome, meaning the survival and retrievability of the species or the information processed. They have found that TAP is still vulnerable to this same type of circularity because it lacks a precise and definite definition. Basically, TAP can only be identified as happening only AFTER retrieval has occurred. Roediger and Gallo argue that after 30 years of research, they still cannot identify why or how we get the typical levels-of-processing effect. However, they still believe that even with these doubts that memory retrieval can be studied and subjected to experiments with \\"specified\\" retrieval conditions. Therefore, the levels-of- processing effect that TAP falls under supports that the \\"greater survival\\" of deep processing most likely occurs, which means that if they had any doubts about transfer-appropriate processing, they should consider the fact that retrieval has more of a range than a semantic processing theory would support, and more than likely thrive and survive. Examples An example of TAP can be compared to the theory of natural selection presented by Darwin in the section above. This means that if a certain species is \\"fitter\\" than the other species, then that fitter species is more likely to continue to adapt to future environmental situations. Lockhart, who refers to this phenomenon, suggests that if a rabbit and a koala were compared that a rabbit would thrive and survive in many environments whereas the koala has worked itself into a \\"narrow ecological niche\\". This means the rabbit would excel at surviving because it has a wider range of flexible qualities. Of course it could be argued that there would be certain areas that the koala would thrive in, but they are not as numerous as the survival qualities of the rabbit. References * Goldstein, E. B.

Mignogna was going to direct the film as well. However, due to his death one year before the start of production, his friend and frequent collaborator, Ricardo Dar√≠n, took up the task. He was aided by Mart√≠n Hodara, who had his directorial debut. Dar√≠n also starred in the lead role, along with Diego Peretti, Julieta D√≠az and Andrea Pietra. The film is dedicated to Eduardo Mignogna.  Synopsis  The film starts in medias res, with Corval√°n hiding in a safehouse and preparing himself for a gunfight. The film then takes a step back to the start, in the form of a flashback. The year is 1952: Eva Per√≥n has retired from public life due to poor health, and her final days are being broadcast on the radio. Corval√°n, alias \\"El Pibe\\" (The Kid, Ricardo Dar√≠n) and Santana (Diego Peretti) are two amateur private detectives living off oddjobs and gambling. Corval√°n is also in a decaying relationship with Perla (Andrea Pietra). After one unlucky day at the tracks, Corval√°n meets a mysterious woman, Gloria (Julieta D√≠az), in a caf√©. She passes him her telephone number and leaves. Corval√°n tries to contact her, but unsuccessfully so until he is reached by Gloria herself, and presented with an assignment: trail a man, Nicol√°s Pertureta, all day and report his movements. Although Pertureta proves difficult to follow, Corval√°n manages to garner information about Pertureta contacting a number of shady people. Corval√°n recruits his cautious partner, Santana, into the assignment - while keeping his regular tasks in hand. Perla is caught cheating on Corval√°n, Pertureta is found strangled with barbed wire, and it is revealed that Gloria is the wife of a major mafia boss, \\"El Noruego\\" (The Norwegian), who is being stalked by Dino Capuano, the last surviving member of a family he massacred years ago in Sicily. Because El Noruego suspects a snitch, and Gloria fears for her safety, she confesses to Corval√°n that she hired him to give her, and indirectly her husband, proof that the snitch is Pertureta. Santana wants no business with the feud between El Noruego and Dino Capuano, but Corval√°n, moved by Gloria's story, decides to help her, and together they go into hiding at a safehouse. It is here that the movie catches up with the start, and Corval√°n engages in a gunfight with El Noruego's henchmen. He and Gloria escape after killing one of them, and as Corval√°n runs out of bullets, Santana arrives and rescues them. Upon getting word that El Noruego and his gang have been gunned down by Capuano's men, Gloria manages to convince Corval√°n to disappear with her. To do so, Corval√°n must first return to El Noruego's place and open the safe that holds savings worth a lifetime. In the movie's climax, Corval√°n manages to open the safe and reads the \\"Remington\\" seal in the safe-box and remembers that days ago his father told him he had a safe-box with a five-digit combination.Corval√°n is suddenly interrupted by Gloria's chauffeur, who points a gun at him and demands the money. Just as he is about to kill him, he is shot in the back by Gloria as he, in turn, shoots Corval√°n. Gloria leaves Corval√°n to die, and walks away with the money. In the last scene, Santana painfully identifies Corval√°n's body at the morgue. He mutters \\"So long, my friend\\" (in English) and leaves. In the radio, a speaker announces the death of Eva Per√≥n and the national mourning.

History Damage to embankments of the Ajay and consequent flooding was a regular problem in the Ausgram and Mangalkot area. The devastating flood of 1943 caused immense suffering and led to a mass movement for restoration/ repair of the embankments. A massive meeting was organised at Guskara in 1944, with Uday Chand Mahtab, Maharaja of Bardhaman. However, the government did not take any action. Ultimately, the Communist Party, which had been at the forefront of agitations for some years, provided a huge work force for the purpose and completed the repair work. It laid the foundation for the party's popularity in the area.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, p. 482, Radical Impression.

The entire Durgapur-Kanksa -Faridpur-Ausgram area was densely forested even in more recent times. The influx of refugees from East Pakistan and their rehabilitation in the area, and irrigation facilities extended by Damodar Valley Corporation led to destruction of much of the forests in the area, but some still remain.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p38, 542 Mangolkote CD Block is bounded by Nanoor CD Block, in Birbhum district, and Ketugram I and Ketugram II CD Blocks on the north, Katwa I CD Block on the east, Bhatar CD Block on the south and Ausgram I CD Block in the west.

Infrastructure There are 130 inhabited villages in Mongalkote CD block. All 130 villages (100%) have power supply. All 130 villages (100%) have drinking water supply. 53 villages (40.77%) have post offices. All 130 villages (100%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 66 villages (50.77%) have a pucca (paved) approach road and 76 villages (58.46%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 38 villages (29.23%) have agricultural credit societies. 27 villages (20.77%) have banks. In 2013-14, there were 148 fertiliser depots, 5 seed stores and 75 fair price shops in the CD Block. Agriculture Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal.

It includes all of the land that had remained unincorporated in southwest Fulton County with the exception of the Fulton Industrial Boulevard corridor. The communities of Red Oak, Cooks Crossing, Stonewall Tell, Fife, (part of) Campbellton, Ben Hill, Sandtown, Cliftondale, and Peters Woods (a few of which were towns founded before the American Civil War) are located in South Fulton. It has a population of 99,155 and an area of . The first mayor of South Fulton is Bill Edwards, who previously served on the Fulton County Board of Commissioners from 2000 to 2014. His term expires on December 31, 2021.  History  In 2007, the region voted in a referendum 85% against forming a municipality. In the Georgia State Senate, Kasim Reed sponsored the legislation authorizing the referendum. The 2016 Georgia General Assembly passed bill HB514 to incorporate South Fulton, which received the signature of Governor Nathan Deal on April 29, 2016. On November 8, 59% of the citizens of South Fulton voted to become a chartered city. In early 2017, South Fulton held elections on March 21, followed by runoff elections before incorporation took effect on May 1. This referendum, like the one before it, was part of a \\"cityhood movement\\" in the Atlanta metropolitan area that began with the incorporation of Sandy Springs in 2005, on the opposite side of Atlanta, with several other communities in Fulton voting to incorporate in 2007. With the passage of the South Fulton referendum in 2016, Fulton County became the first county in Georgia with no unincorporated residential areas. As a result, in 2017 Fulton County also became the first county in Georgia to cease providing municipal services such as fire, police, zoning, and code enforcement. Many former Fulton County personnel and facilities were transferred to the City of South Fulton. In November 2017, after a one-year waiting period mandated by state law, the city council selected Renaissance as the new name for the city, also having considered Campbellton (a historic town now partly within the city), Atlanta Heights, Wolf Creek and retaining South Fulton among a total of 20 names out of 250 suggested by the public. Following a three-week public notice period and two regular public meetings, which are required to amend the city charter, the city council approved the name change in December 2017. However, Mayor Edwards vetoed the name change on December 18, citing several reasons including contracts and some public opposition. Demographics South Fulton's population as of 2019 is estimated to be 99,155. In 2010, prior to incorporation, the United States Census Bureau estimates that the area now within South Fulton's boundaries was home to 85,769 people. More than 90% of South Fulton residents are African Americans.

It is also held in other regions of Japan, such as Iwate Prefecture, Niigata Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, and Ehime Prefecture. Although sometimes known to Westerners as \\"Okinawan bullfighting\\", it is drastically different from the Spanish or Portuguese style of bullfighting where the matches are between a bull and a human, with blood being spilt. T≈çgy≈´ has more in common with northern Portugal's sport of chegas and the Swiss sport of cow fighting. During matches, the bulls lock horns and attempt to force each other to give up ground. Each bull has a coach who helps to keep the bulls locked in conflict and encourages their bull to win. The match is over when one of the bulls tires and withdraws, losing the match. The coaches take great care to prevent the bulls from harming each other and the fight is immediately over if one of them accidentally gores the other. Hlavac, Tyler \\"Lockin' horns\\" USMC Public Affairs Office, 2007. History The sport started at least as early as the 17th century, with farmers pitting bulls against each other as a fun sport.Okinawa: The Southern Gateway, 3rd edition, 1988. pp.188-120 Although the exact year in which t≈çgy≈´ was started is not known, the second half of the Meiji period is when it began to get popular throughout Okinawa.http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~office21/history.html&prev;=/language_tools Big Globe's T≈çgyu history page(In Japanese) In 1907, t≈çgy≈´ became popular enough in the cities of Itoman, Gushikawa, Katsuren and Yonagusuku to start receiving coverage in local newspapers. During the Sh≈çwa period, prior to the outbreak of World War II, t≈çgy≈´ reached new heights of popularity. So great was its popularity that a village is said to have banned it because the villagers spent too much time enjoying the fights, instead of working in the fields. During the Ryukyu Islands campaign of World War II, the fights ceased, as the Ryukyu Islands became a war zone. Only a few months after the war's end on August 14, 1945, the fights began again. Between 1950 and 1960, rules became codified and conferences became formed in order to organize the events. In 1965, popularity peaked, with one event bringing in 10,000 spectators. The sport is deeply ingrained in the local culture of the Ryukyu island of Tokunoshima, where bullfights are major cultural events and bull owners use their bulls as markers of social status. Because of the importance of t≈çgyu in Tokunoshima, the island's mascot and much local iconography is a t≈çgyu bull. Ranking Just as in sumo, bulls are ranked by their ability, with the top position in both sports being known as yokozuna. Similarities continue down the ranking chain as t≈çgy≈´ has mirrored sumo's ranking terms. Unlike in sumo, there are weight classes and thus lighter bulls are not expected to compete against the heavier ones.

He was the first Cyrenaean king to rule as a client king under the Persian Empire. Ancestry Battus was the son and only child of the fifth Cyrenaean king, Arcesilaus III. His mother was the daughter of Alazir, a Libyan who served as governor of Barca. Herodotus states that his father and his maternal grandfather were related and his maternal grandmother is unknown. Reign Battus succeeded his paternal grandmother in late 515 BC. She had died from a skin disease in Egypt. From 515 BC until 465 BC, Battus ruled as king of Cyrenaica. Very little is known about his reign although it seems that his reign was peaceful. During his reign, Cyrenaica exported wheat, barley, olive oil and silphium (a now extinct plant that had aromatic & medicinal properties). He was succeeded by his son Arcesilaus IV and was buried near his paternal ancestors.

Susquehanna marked the band's return to recording after nearly a decade following their hiatus in 2000 and sporadic touring throughout 2002‚Äì2006. The album follows the eclectic format of previous records, with Latin and Caribbean-influences in addition to the band's usual swing, ska, and rock. Overview Susquehanna is influenced by Latin and Caribbean music, incorporating flamenco (\\"Roseanne\\"), soca (\\"Tom the Lion\\"), bossa nova (\\"Breathe\\"), Latin rock (\\"Bust Out\\"), and reggae (\\"Blood Orange Sun\\") with swing, ska, and rockabilly. While the majority of the album is original, a notable exception is a re-recording of \\"Hi and Lo\\", a ska punk song written by Daddies frontman Steve Perry for The Mighty Mighty Bosstones in the mid-1990s, ending up as part of the Daddies' own repertoire and becoming a staple of their live shows. Perry explained that the album's tropical slant was due to his prediction that one day \\"American pop will owe a huge debt to world sensibilities...these I wanted to explore and potentially boil down to some fundamental building blocks that might lead toward a new, more international style\\". Stylistically, Perry claimed that he based the structure of Susquehanna on James Joyce's Ulysses in that each of the songs were written in a different style and genre but the album was thematically coherent. He elaborated that he drew inspiration from Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film Pierrot le fou in that \\"songs are a means to an end. Genres reflect off each other\\". \\"It's like a little movie, doing what I always do with genres, which is to use them kind of like paint. I use various genres and grind them against each other. I like to put a flamenco song next to a song that's a glam rock song next to a song that's a swing song, so that the flavor changes.\\" Like most of the Daddies' previous albums, Susquehanna is written as a loose concept album. Described by Perry as a portrait of \\"various relationships in decay\\", each song deals with memories, all written in the format of an abstract narrative following a character in the aftermath of a broken relationship. Perry has summarized Susquehanna as being about \\"losses and continuing on. It's about love, doubt and fatigue...and ultimately about gratitude\\".Perry, Steve. The Official CPD Website. 2008. Production history News of a new Daddies studio album first surfaced in mid-2006 during a radio interview with Steve Perry. He confirmed that a new album was in the process of being written and would cover some new territory for the band, drawing on Latin, tropical and reggae sounds, though it would contain a few swing tracks as well.Maxim, Bryce (Apr. 8, 2006). Interview with Steve Perry (audio). WMLB AM 1160, Backstage Atlanta. Most of this new material was debuted during the band's 2006 US tour. On February 9, 2007, the band released a collection of demo songs available for purchase: the reggae-tinged \\"Blood Orange Sun\\", the Latin-inspired \\"Bust Out\\", and the flamenco ballad \\"Roseanne\\". According to a blog on the band's official MySpace page, recording began on the 25th of June. By September 5, the record was finally tracked but not fully mixed, and given the title Susquehanna, after the river near where Perry grew up (up until then, the album went under a number of working titles, including Truth & Consequences and The Good Things). Perry confirmed that there were 12 tracks on the album, and that they were \\"...all part of the same story..... does that make it a rock opera, concept album or just a bunch of stuff that happened?\\"Perry, Steve (Sep. 5, 2007). Official Website Update. Daddies.com Susquehanna was released via digital download through the Daddies' website on February 19, 2008, before being made available in a limited CD pressing on June 10, 2008. Both formats of the album were available to purchase exclusively through the band's website until their signing to independent label Rock Ridge Music in 2009, when Susquehanna was re-issued and given national distribution on September 29, 2009 in conjuncture with the Daddies' ska compilation Skaboy JFK. Response Critical reception of Susquehanna ranged from mixed to positive. While its low-profile release went mostly unnoticed by major media outlets, various internet publications were polarized over the album's multi-genre format, either praising the band for their musical experimentation or criticizing them as inconsistent. AbsolutePunk.net awarded the album an 86% rating, stating \\"there are only good things to say about the Cherry Poppin' Daddies new album\\", calling it \\"full of fun and surprisingly entertaining\\".Frances, Susan. 'Cherry Poppin' Daddies - Susquehanna' AbsolutePunk.net October 1, 2008.

He served as a client king under Persian authority. Biography Arcesilaus was the only child of the seventh Cyrenaean king, Battus IV. When his father died in 465 BC Arcesilaus became the new king. In 462 BC, Arcesilaus won a chariot race at the Pythian Games at Delphi using native Libyan horses . His victory was celebrated by Greek poet Pindar in the Fourth and Fifth Pythian Odes. Pindar advises Arcesilaus in his ode to reconcile with his opponents and stresses the legitimacy of his rule because his family has ruled in Cyrenaica for eight generations . His reign grew progressively more tyrannical, exiling many Cyrenaean nobles and bringing in mercenaries to support his rule. As a result of his actions, the Cyrenaeans rebelled, forcing Arcesilaus to leave Cyrene and flee to Euesperides (modern Benghazi) with his son and only child, Battus V. Arcesilaus, along with his son, were killed by the Cyrenaean citizens in 440 BC. It is said that after Battus was killed, the Cyrenaeans cut off his head and threw his head into the sea. With Battus‚Äô beheading, Battiad rule in Cyrenaica ended and the citizens proclaimed Cyrenaica a narrow democracy.Hornblower (2011): 66 See also * List of Kings of Cyrene ReferencesSources *Herodotus, The Histories, Book 4 *Burn, A R.

Completed portions of the Hackensack RiverWalk, a public waterfront promenade which is accessible to the public through entrances outside the development, run along the shoreline. History=Minkakwa and Morris Canal Originally a tidal marsh, the area was the territory of the Hackensack and Raritan at the time of European contact in the 17th century. They called the area on Minkakwa, meaning a place of good crossing. This is likely so because it was the most convenient pass between two bays (the other being the Upper New York Bay) on either side of the Bergen Neck peninsula and near a natural break in Bergen Hill, the formation that rises to become the Hudson Palisades. Interpreted as place where the coves meet, in this case where they are closest to each, it describes a spot advantageous for portage. Just inland of Droyer's Point the construction of the Morris Canal in the 1830s took advantage of the geology to cut across Pamrapo. The canal then ran parallel to the bay before connecting to the river at a location further to the north.JC Online:Morris Canal1860 Map A filled portion of the landmark can still be seen as an unmarked right of way in the nearby Country Village neighborhood. Jersey City Airport In the 1920s the land which was owned by the city became the object of development which included land reclamation and the construction of bulkhead, with the intention of expanding the city's port facilities south of the CRRNJ Newark and New York Railroad (which traveled from Downtown Newark across the river and Bergen Hill to Communipaw Terminal). While the planned distribution facilities never materialized, the area did become the site of the short lived Jersey City Airport, which opened in 1927.JC A to Z Droyer's Point For a short time the airport was operated by Eddie August Schneider, a native of the city and one of early aviation's youthful celebrities. After the end of World War Two, Jersey Skyports was founded by three former Naval aviators, Edward Selig Binder, John Barteluse, and Bill Christie, and operated for five years. The Jersey City Seaplane Base which was owned by Harry Frank, was later located nearby.http://newjersey.quickcityinfo.com/Carlstadt/Airports/1166401/Jersey_City_Seaplane_Base Roosevelt Stadium Map of Droyer's Point during stadium era The Art Deco style Roosevelt Stadium was Works Progress Administration project secured by Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague, as was the Jersey City Medical Center. It was named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the author of that New Deal agency. Groundbreaking took place in 1935. The baseball park's opening was scheduled for April 22, 1937 with the opening of the 1937 International League season. Mayor Hague declared a half-holiday for the city's schools and employees. New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham was expected at the opener along with Senator A. Harry Moore. Rain washed out the planned events and the opening was postponed until April 23 with Mayor Hague throwing out the first pitch and Sen. Moore and owner Horace Stoneham on hand for the ballpark's dedication. The stadium was also the home field of the Jersey City Giants, and was used for seven \\"home\\" games by the Brooklyn Dodgers during their last couple of seasons in Brooklyn, 1956 and 1957. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson. The stadium also hosted boxing bouts including fight with Max Baer, \\"Two Ton Tony\\" Galento, Marcel Cerdan and Tony Zale. In 1950, Sugar Ray Robinson defended his welterweight title; in 1951, Jersey Joe Walcott beat heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles. During the 1970s the stadium was used every summer as a major concert venue with performances by the Grateful Dead, Allman Brothers Band, Beach Boys, Eric Clapton, Tony Bennett, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, among others.

Overview Evergreening is not a formal concept of patent law; it is best understood as a social idea used to refer to the myriad ways in which pharmaceutical patent owners use the law and related regulatory processes to extend their high-earning intellectual property rights, particularly over highly profitable (either in total sales volume or price per unit) \\"blockbuster\\" drugs. Thus, while the courts are an instrument frequently used by pharmaceutical brand name manufacturers to prolong their patent royalties, evergreening is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent protection cases. The term usually refers to threats made to competitors about a brand-name manufacturer's tactical use of pharmaceutical patents (including over uses, delivery systems and even packaging), not to extension of any particular patent over an active product ingredient. Controversy The evergreening process has caused some controversy in the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, evergreening may be used by manufacturers of a particular drug to restrict or prevent competition from manufacturers of generic equivalents to that drug. In 2002, an extensive and lengthy inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found, in the wake of the Hatch-Waxman legislation or Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (which was instrumental in establishing the US generic pharmaceuticals industry), as many as 75% of new drug applications by generic drug manufacturers had been contested with legal actions under patent laws by the original brand name patent owner. These were driving up US drug costs by keeping the cheaper generic versions off the market. The FTC recommended only one evergreening injunction against a potential generic market entrant be permitted per product, and an expedited process of resolving such claims. Linkage evergreening and international trade law The process of evergreening may involve specific aspects of patent law and international trade law. Linkage evergreening is the process whereby pharmaceutical safety, quality and efficacy regulators are required to 'link' their normal evaluation with an assessment of whether an impending generic product may infringe an existing patent. By country=Australia A requirement for the AUSFTA to come into force was fulfilment of the article 17.10.4 linkage obligation; done by amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth). The amendments inserted a new section 26B which required applicants for marketing approval to certify their product would not infringe a valid patent claim, or that the patent holder had been notified of the application. In response, the Australian government passed anti-evergreening amendments in Sections 26C and 26D of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) designed to prevent patent holders from manipulating the court system to lengthen the term of the patent and delay the entry of generic pharmaceuticals into the market. They are a strong statement of Australia's legitimate expectations of benefit (that is of freedom from pharmaceutical price rises due to evergreening) in this area. The Chief Australian negotiator of this aspect of the AUSFTA stated: In November 2004, the US expressly signalled their disapproval of Australia's implementation of article 17.10.4 in an exchange of letters between the Australian Minister for Trade and the US Trade Representative on the implementation of the AUSFTA, in which the USTR stated: The capacity of the US to make such threats is arguably facilitated by the linkage of article 17.10.4 of the AUSFTA to a non-violation nullification of benefits provision. Canada In 1993, under the NAFTA-induced Canadian Notice Of Compliance (NOC) regulations, drug safety, quality and efficacy regulators at Health Canada were prevented from issuing an authorization for market entry, until all of the relevant patents on a brand name product had been proven to have expired. As a result, when a Canadian generic company (such as Apotex) submits its application to get a product approved, it also sends a Notice of Allegation (NOA) to the patent holder claiming that no patents are being infringed. The patent holder then has 45 days in which to initiate an application in the Federal Court of Canada, seeking an order to prohibit the relevant Minister from issuing a Notice of Compliance to the generic manufacturer for a period of 24 months, or upon resolution of the court application, whichever is sooner. The problems with this were analysed in the Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada or Romanow Report. India Indian patent Act was amended in 2005 under obligations to TRIPS. Novartis v. Union of India & Others is a landmark decision, in which Indian Supreme Court upheld rejection of Novartis patent by Indian patent office. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, Paragraph 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if \\"they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.\\" W.P. No.24759 of 2006 South Korea The US has achieved a similar provision to article 17.10.4 of the AUSFTA in article 18.9.4 of the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUSFTA). Such provisions are sometimes referred to as TRIPS-plus meaning that they are in addition to the patent requirements of the World Trade Organization multilateral Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement. Some academics prefer to refer to them as TRIPS- minus due to their potential, but controversial and still largely unproven, deleterious impact on public health.El-Said M. The Road from TRIPS-Minus, to TRIPS, to TRIPS-Plus Implications of IPRs for the Arab World The Journal of World Intellectual Property 2005; 8 (1): 53-65 United States Various laws have provisions to limit the practice, but as of 2018 the issue remains a concern among legislators. According to one study, 12 top-selling drugs attempted an average 38 years of patent protection, above the granted 20 years. Another study found that nearly 80% of the top 100 drugs extended the duration of patent protection with a new patent. Issues which prevent generics from reaching the market include: * lack of availability of samples to do testing; the CREATES Act is a bill proposed to address issues in getting samples, and appeared likely to pass in 2018 * Risk Evaluation and Mitigation System (REMS) requirements *reverse payment settlements, which involve payment to delay; these are required to be reported to the FTC for generics since 2004 and biosimilars since 2018 *‚ÄúCitizen petitions‚Äù: Citizen Petitions and Petitions for Stay of Action Subject to Section 505(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allow the Food and Drug Administration to delay action on a pending generic drug application. By law, the FDA is required to prioritize these petitions. However, the citizens filing concerns are not individuals, they‚Äôre corporations. The FDA recently said branded drug manufacturers submitted 92% of all citizen petitions. Many of these petitions are filed near the date of patent expiration, effectively limiting potential competition for another 150 days. *‚ÄúAuthorized generics\\": an authorized generic is exactly the same as the brand name drug, but marketed without the brand name on the label. By law, the first generic company to market a drug gets an exclusivity period of 180 days. During this time, no other companies can market a generic product. But the company with the expiring patent is not barred from launching an ‚Äúauthorized generic.‚Äù By selling a drug they are already making under a different name, pharmaceutical firms are effectively extending their monopoly for another six months.  Regulation  The main arguments in favor of governments regulating against evergreening are that rapid entry of multiple generic competitors after patent expiry is likely to lower prices and facilitate competition, and that eventual loss of monopoly was part of the trade-off for the initial award of patent (or intellectual monopoly privilege) protection in the first place. In Canada, the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison under Health Canada has become an important regulatory mechanism for policing \\"linkage\\" evergreening. No attempt has been made to create a similar multidisciplinary regulatory agency in Australia. Yet, it appears that article 18.9.4 of the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUSFTA) has been specifically drafted to permit the establishment of such a pharmaceutical patent \\"anti-evergreening\\" oversight agency. The Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison is located in the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Products and Foods Branch, Health Canada.Health Canada. Therapeutic Products Directory. Drugs and Patents The Notice of Compliance Regulations it administers require the Minister of Health to maintain a Patent Register.Health Canada Electronic copy of the Patent Register (accessed 19 June 2009) This consists of patent lists submitted in respect of eligible NOC-issued drugs. The Minister responsible for Health Canada may refuse to add, or may delete, information from this Patent Register. Each patent list is audited (for example as to whether potential inclusions are mere 'evergreening' attempts) by the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison. Reports produced by that body outline statistics relating to the maintenance of the Patent Register, including the number of patents filed, the number of patents accepted and rejected, and litigation resulting from the acceptance or rejection of patents for listing on the Patent Register. In October 2006, the Canadian federal government recognized that some brand-name companies had been abusing the NOC Regulations. It limited their use of 'evergreening' follow-on patents by promulgating regulations that prevented any new patents they filed after a generic company had submitted an application for approval of its product from being considered in the NOC Regulations process. Moreover, the new regulations made it clear that patents covering areas without direct therapeutic application, such as processes or intermediates, could not be used to delay generic approval. In Australia, anti-evergreening amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1983 (Cth)were part of the package of legislation required to be passed by the Australian Government as a precondition to entry into force of the Australia- United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA). They provide that where a certificate has been given under s26B by a generic manufacturer and the patent holder wishes to claim a patent and institute infringement proceedings, he or she must first certify that the proceedings are being commenced in good faith, have reasonable prospects of success (as defined in s26C(4)) and will be conducted without unreasonable delay. If the certificate is found to be false or misleading, fines of up to $10 million apply and the Cth Attorney General is permitted to join the action to recoup losses to the PBS. Section 26D provides that a patent holder who seeks an interlocutory injunction to prevent the marketing of the generic pharmaceutical must obtain leave from the government to do so.Therapeutic Goods Act 1983 (Cth) ss 26C and 26D TRIPS Both the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Associations (IFPMA) and the US PhRMA have stated that the Australian anti- evergreening provisions are inconsistent with obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights TRIPS article 27 which prohibits discrimination in an area of technology (in this case pharmaceuticals). The argument is that the Australian anti-\\"linkage evergreening\\" legislation affects only pharmaceutical patents and is therefore discriminatory under TRIPS. On the other hand, international trade law recognises that where a unique problem arises specifically referable only to a particular field of technology, a solution applying sui generis only to that field of technology cannot be said to be discriminatory according to the ordinary meaning and purpose of the TRIPS agreement or the AUSFTA as required by article AUSFTA 21.9.2 (incorporating articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The decision of the World Trade Organization Dispute Resolution panel in Canada ‚Äì Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products case, for example, accepted that it was not inconsistent with TRIPS to provide for distinct patent rules that responded to practical consequences of differences between fields of technology.See Canada ‚Äì Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products WTO Doc WT/DS114/R 2000:5.9. Report of the Panel Almost all nations including the United States now have anti-evergreening legislation as part of their public health policy and none of this legislation (which is clearly targeted at a problem particular to the pharmaceutical industry) has been argued to be contrary to TRIPS. Further, there are a number of obligations imposed by the AUSFTA that relate to the enjoyment of patent rights for pharmaceuticals alone, including extension of the terms of a pharmaceutical patent to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process(17.9.8(b)). This is clearly not discriminatory because the issue of delays in enjoyment of patent rights due to the marketing approval process arises only in the context of pharmaceutical patents. Future In terms of future evergreening strategies, patent holders may: # seek to make incremental patentable innovations to existing products with soon-to-expire patents through the generic arm of their own company and launch early to secure market share (supragenerics), # attempt to make separately patentable nanotechnology or biologic versions of such pharmaceuticals through the generic arm of their own company and launch early to secure market share, # seek to exclude generic companies from the safety, quality and efficacy data they need to prepare for springboarding (early market launch after patent expiry) using TRIPs-plus data exclusivity protections and # seek to extend exclusivity on a soon-to-patent-expire-pharmaceutical by patenting a genetic test to establish potential toxicity or efficacy (pharmacogenomics).

He was general secretary of the United Communist Party of India at the time of his death. Early life and education Sen was born into a progressive and westernised Brahmo Samaj family. His father, Justice Amarendra Nath Sen, was a judge of the Calcutta High Court and his mother, Mrinalini Sen (n√©e Sinha), was an eminent dancer. His paternal grandfather was an Advocate General of Burma. His maternal grandfather was Major N.P. Sinha, a member of the Indian Medical Service and his mother's elder uncle was Lord Satyendra Prasanno Sinha, the first Indian Governor of Bihar. On his mother's side he came from the zamindari family of Raipur in Birbhum, a district in present-day West Bengal. He had five other brothers, the eldest of whom was Sh. Pratap Chandra Sen, a student of history at Presidency College, Calcutta, who rose to a high position in a mercantile firm in Calcutta in spite of remaining a closet communist. Mohit Sen had his early education at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where he was a student of Professor Susobhan Sarkar. Later he studied at the University of Cambridge, UK. In communist movement While in Cambridge, in 1948, he joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) as a 'candidate-member'.The CPI constitution stipulates that a member be admitted first as a candidate, and thereafter depending on whether his or her performance is satisfactory, full membership is given. Also in Cambridge he met and married Vanaja Iyengar, who became an eminent mathematician later, in 1950. After marriage the couple moved to the People's Republic of China. Sen went to the China International Communist School in Beijing between 1950 and 1953. After his return to India, Mohit Sen worked in the CPI central office in New Delhi and also for its publishing house during 1953‚Äì62. Later he became party organiser and teacher in Andhra Pradesh. Political life Mohit Sen arrived in India during a period when India had won her independence. The appraisal of the CPI at that time was that the country had not really got freedom, but was still a 'semi-colony' of Britain. The following words of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was then prime minister, to visiting Soviet leaders Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev in 1955, aptly summarises the CPI's position then: > Until this year (1955) the Communist Party was saying that Indian people > were not independent; they even opposed our National Day celebrations.... > They also said that when they were in doubt about the right line of action, > they had to get directions from the Soviet Union. Early in 1951‚Äì52, some > principal leaders of the Communist Party went to Moscow secretly, that is > without passports. They came back and said that they had got directions from > Mr. Joseph Stalin. At least this is what they said. The line then laid down > was one of full opposition (to the Government) and, where possible, petty > insurrections.Jawaharlal Nehru, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Second > Series, Volume XXXI, edited by H.Y. Sharada Prasad and A.K. Damodaran, A > Project of Jawaharlal Nehru Fund, distributed by Oxford University Press, > New Delhi. Mohit Sen stood for collaboration with Congress for fighting against imperialist forces. When the CPI split, and gave rise to a new party, the Communist Party of India, Sen remained with the original CPI, under chairmanship of S.A. Dange, which was following nationalist line. He became a national council member of CPI in 1966 and was elected to party central executive committee in 1971. Sen parted ways with the CPI, following its anti- Congress stand, in 1978, following Indira Gandhi's emergency and subsequent failure in the election. In 1985, Sen joined the Indian Communist Party and when it merged with the All India Communist Party in 1988 to become United Communist Party of India, Sen became its general secretary, a post he held for 15 years till his death. He was married to Vanaja Iyengar, a mathematician, Padma Shri awardee and founder vice chancellor of Sri Padmavati Mahila Visvavidyalayam and at the time of his death, Sen, 74, was a widower and had no children.  Writer Sen was a prolific writer; credited to him are following books: * Revolution in India ‚Äî Problems and Perspectives * Glimpses of the History of the Communist movement in India * Maoism and Chinese Revolution * Congress and socialism * Naxalites and the Communists, and * A Traveller And The Road: A Journey Of An Indian Communist. Mohit Sen appearing on the cover of his autobiography A Traveller and the Road: A Journey of an Indian Communist He published his autobiography A Traveller and the Road: A Journey of an Indian Communist in March 2003, few months before his death. The book brought out Sen's evolution as an independent leftist thinker. Eric Hobsbawm, the historian, had opined about the book that :\\"‚Ä¶ it is a most remarkable book, written with unremitting passion and love, with acute observation of those who gave their lives to the case, but with sceptical judgment. In my view no more illuminating first-hand book on the history of Indian Communism has been written, nor is likely to be written‚Ä¶ India was lucky to enter independence with people as honest, as selfless, and as devoted to service of the people as he.\\" See also *Indian Communist Party (Sen) NotesExternal links #Satchidanda Mohany: A Man called Mohit Sen An obituary in The Hindu, Chennai. # Kanwalpreet: The memoirs of a Communist A review of A Traveller and the Road: The Journey of an Indian Communist appearing in The Sunday Tribune, Chandigarh # Blog on Mohit Sen Category:1929 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Brahmos Category:Politicians from Kolkata Category:Communist Party of India politicians from West Bengal Category:Bengali politicians Category:20th-century Indian politicians ","title":"Mohit Sen"},{"id":"13367554","text":"The Heavy Blinkers are a Canadian orchestrated-pop music group, from Halifax, Nova Scotia.

This includes both soil organic matter and inorganic carbon as carbonate minerals. Soil carbon is a carbon sink in regard to the global carbon cycle, playing a role in biogeochemistry, climate change mitigation, and constructing global climate models. Overview Soil carbon is present in two forms: inorganic and organic. Soil inorganic carbon consists of mineral forms of carbon, either from weathering of parent material, or from reaction of soil minerals with atmospheric CO2. Carbonate minerals are the dominant form of soil carbon in desert climates. Soil organic carbon is present as soil organic matter. It includes relatively available carbon as fresh plant remains and relatively inert carbon in materials derived from plant remains: humus and charcoal. Global carbon cycle Although exact quantities are difficult to measure, human activities have caused substantial losses of soil organic carbon. Of the 2,700 Gt of carbon stored in soils worldwide, 1550 GtC is organic and 950 GtC is inorganic carbon, which is approximately three times greater than the current atmospheric carbon and 240 times higher compared with the current annual fossil fuel emission. The balance of soil carbon is held in peat and wetlands (150 GtC), and in plant litter at the soil surface (50 GtC). This compares to 780 GtC in the atmosphere, and 600 GtC in all living organisms. The oceanic pool accounts for 38,200 GtC. About 60 GtC/yr accumulates in the soil. This 60 GtC/yr is the balance of 120 GtC/yr contracted from the atmosphere by terrestrial plant photosynthesis reduced by 60 GtC/yr of plant respiration. An equivalent 60 GtC/yr is respired from soil, joining the 60G tC/yr plant respiration to return to the atmosphere. Organic carbon Soil organic carbon is divided between living soil biota and dead biotic material derived from biomass. Together these comprise the soil food web, with the living component sustained by the biotic material component. Soil biota includes earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, fungi, bacteria and different arthropods. Detritus resulting from plant senescence is the major source of soil organic carbon. Plant materials, with cell walls high in cellulose and lignin, are decomposed and the not-respired carbon is retained as humus. Cellulose and starches readily degrade, resulting in short residence times. More persistent forms of organic C include lignin, humus, organic matter encapsulated in soil aggregates, and charcoal. These resist alteration and have long residence times. Soil organic carbon tends to be concentrated in the topsoil. Topsoil ranges from 0.5% to 3.0% organic carbon for most upland soils. Soils with less than 0.5% organic C are mostly limited to desert areas. Soils containing greater than 12 - 18% organic carbon are generally classified as organic soils. High levels of organic C develop in soils supporting wetland ecology, flood deposition, fire ecology, and human activity. Fire derived forms of carbon are present in most soils as unweathered charcoal and weathered black carbon. Soil organic carbon is typically 5 - 50% derived from char, with levels above 50% encountered in mollisol, chernozem, and terra preta soils. Root exudates are another source of soil carbon. 5 - 20% of the total plant carbon fixed during photosynthesis is supplied as root exudates in support of rhizospheric mutualistic biota. Microbial populations are typically higher in the rhizosphere than in adjacent bulk soil. Soil health A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO2 flux Organic carbon is vital to soil capacity to provide edaphic ecosystem services. The condition of this capacity is termed soil health, a term that communicates the value of understanding soil as a living system as opposed to an abiotic component. Specific carbon related benchmarks used to evaluate soil health include CO2 release, humus levels, and microbial metabolic activity. Losses The exchange of carbon between soils and the atmosphere is a significant part of the world carbon cycle. Carbon, as it relates to the organic matter of soils, is a major component of soil and catchment health. Several factors affect the variation that exists in soil organic matter and soil carbon; the most significant has, in contemporary times, been the influence of humans and agricultural systems. Although exact quantities are difficult to measure, human activities have caused massive losses of soil organic carbon. First was the use of fire, which removes soil cover and leads to immediate and continuing losses of soil organic carbon. Tillage and drainage both expose soil organic matter to oxygen and oxidation. In the Netherlands, East Anglia, Florida, and the California Delta, subsidence of peat lands from oxidation has been severe as a result of tillage and drainage. Grazing management that exposes soil (through either excessive or insufficient recovery periods) can also cause losses of soil organic. Managing soil carbon Natural variations in soil carbon occur as a result of climate, organisms, parent material, time, and relief. The greatest contemporary influence has been that of humans; for example, carbon in Australian agricultural soils may historically have been twice the present range that is typically from 1.6 to 4.6 per cent. It has long been encouraged that farmers adjust practices to maintain or increase the organic component in the soil. On one hand, practices that hasten oxidation of carbon (such as burning crop stubbles or over- cultivation) are discouraged; on the other hand, incorporation of organic material (such as in manuring) has been encouraged. Increasing soil carbon is not a straightforward matter; it is made complex by the relative activity of soil biota, which can consume and release carbon and are made more active by the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. =Data available on soil organic carbonEurope The most homogeneous and comprehensive data on the organic carbon/matter content of European soils remain those that can be extracted and/or derived from the European Soil Database in combination with associated databases on land cover, climate, and topography. The modelled data refer to carbon content (%) in the surface horizon of soils in Europe. In an inventory on available national datasets, seven member states of the European Union have available datasets on organic carbon. In the article \\"Estimating soil organic carbon in Europe based on data collected through a European network\\" (Ecological Indicators 24, pp. 439‚Äì450), a comparison of national data with modelled data is performed. The LUCAS soil organic carbon data are measured surveyed points and the aggregated results at regional level show important findings. Finally, a new proposed model for estimation of soil organic carbon in agricultural soils has estimated current top SOC stock of 17.63 Gt in EU agricultural soils. This modelling framework has been updated by integrating the soil erosion component to estimate the lateral carbon fluxes. =Managing for catchment health= Much of the contemporary literature on soil carbon relates to its role, or potential, as an atmospheric carbon sink to offset climate change. Despite this emphasis, a much wider range of soil and catchment health aspects are improved as soil carbon is increased. These benefits are difficult to quantify, due to the complexity of natural resource systems and the interpretation of what constitutes soil health; nonetheless, several benefits are proposed in the following points: *Reduced erosion, sedimentation: increased soil aggregate stability means greater resistance to erosion; mass movement is less likely when soils are able to retain structural strength under greater moisture levels. *Greater productivity: healthier and more productive soils can contribute to positive socio-economic circumstances. *Cleaner waterways, nutrients and turbidity: nutrients and sediment tend to be retained by the soil rather than leach or wash off, and are so kept from waterways. *Water balance: greater soil water holding capacity reduces overland flow and recharge to groundwater; the water saved and held by the soil remains available for use by plants. *Climate change: Soils have the ability to retain carbon that may otherwise exist as atmospheric CO2 and contribute to global warming. *Greater biodiversity: soil organic matter contributes to the health of soil flora and, accordingly, the natural links with biodiversity in the greater biosphere. Forest soils Forest soils constitute a large pool of carbon. Anthropogenic activities such as deforestation cause releases of carbon from this pool, which may significantly increase the concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere.IPCC. 2000. Land use, land-use change, and forestry. IPCC Special Report. United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries must estimate and report GHG emissions and removals, including changes in carbon stocks in all five pools (above- and below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil carbon) and associated emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry activities, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's good practice guidance.IPCC. 2003. Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry. Kanagawa, Japan, National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme.IPCC. 2006. Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. Kanagawa, Japan, National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme. Tropical deforestation represents nearly 25 percent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide. Deforestation, forest degradation, and changes in land management practices can cause releases of carbon from soil to the atmosphere. For these reasons, reliable estimates of soil organic carbon stock and stock changes are needed for Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and GHG reporting under the UNFCCC.

Career Born in Toronto, Roberts grew up in Proton Station, Ontario (now a part of Southgate) near Flesherton, Ontario. He attended Grey Highlands Secondary School and played hockey for local teams until he was old enough to move up to Junior B hockey. Roberts's junior hockey career started with the 1972‚Äì73 Owen Sound Greys of the Mid-Ontario Junior B Hockey League. With the help of Roberts, the Greys won their league championship. The Greys eventually came within a win of defeating the Toronto Nationals, which would have given them the chance to win the Sutherland Cup as provincial champions. The next season saw him move up to the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League. In three seasons with the 67's, Roberts tabulated 62 goals and 176 points in 188 regular seasons games. In 1976, after three seasons with the 67's, Roberts was drafted 31st overall by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. The same year, Roberts was also drafted 34th overall by the Houston Aeros in the 1976 WHA Amateur Draft. Roberts started the 1976‚Äì77 season off in the American Hockey League with the New Haven Nighthawks, but after ten games was brought up to play with the Stars for the rest of the season. Roberts split the 1977‚Äì78 season between the North Stars and the Central Hockey League's Fort Worth Texans and split the 1978‚Äì79 season between the North Stars and the CHL's Oklahoma City Stars. At the end of the season, the North Stars left Roberts unprotected and he was picked up by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft; however, he never played another game in the National Hockey League. In 106 National Hockey League games, Roberts scored 17 goals and had 23 assists with 33 penalty minutes, all with the Minnesota North Stars. In 1979‚Äì80, Roberts jumped from the Tulsa Oilers to the Cincinnati Stingers of the CHL and Maine Mariners of the AHL before retiring from professional hockey at the end of the season. Afterwards, he returned to the Flesherton area and played senior hockey for the Ontario Hockey Association's Durham Huskies for several years.

A prolific writer of the \\"Home Literature\\" period of LDS fiction, Anderson published ten novels including the bestselling Added Upon (1898), as well as short stories, poetry, essays, and a history of the Church for young people. Family and Church Life Anderson was born in Christiania (modern Oslo), Norway on 22 January 1865. His parents, Christian and Petronella Nielson, had joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints only a few years before his birth and in 1871 they emigrated to Utah, United States. They settled first in Coalville, Utah and later in Ogden, Utah. In 1886, Anderson married Asenath Tillotson and began a teaching career in Ogden and Brigham City, Utah. From 1891 to 1893 he served a mission for the LDS Church in his birth country of Norway and upon returning, resumed teaching. He served as Superintendent of Schools in Box Elder County, Utah from 1900‚Äì1903. Asenath died in January, 1904, having borne six children with Nephi (three of which survived to adulthood). Just two months after his wife's death, Anderson left on his second mission for the Church, this time to Great Britain where he became assistant editor of the LDS periodical, the Millennial Star, under the direction of Heber J. Grant. Returning to Utah in 1906, Anderson moved his family to Salt Lake City and secured a position as instructor of English and Missionary Studies at LDS High School. In 1908, he married Maud Rebecca Symons, with whom he would have six more children. After a short mission which involved his whole family moving to Independence, Missouri and an assignment there as editor of another LDS periodical, The Liahona, Anderson was asked to come back to Utah and begin working as an editor and librarian with the Genealogical Society of Utah, replacing Joseph Fielding Smith, who had been called to the Church's general leadership. In January, 1923, Anderson developed appendicitis and died on January 6 after an operation for the malady when he developed peritonitis. Speakers at his funeral included Heber J.

Literary career In a piece in The Improvement Era entitled A Plea for Fiction (1898), Anderson wrote of the Mormon experience- \\"What a field is here for the pen of the novelist.\\" Although he is well known for his particular style of early LDS fiction, his first published book was the non-fiction title, A Young Folk's History of the Church (1889). In the early 1890s, Anderson began submitting short works to The Contributor. He published his most recognized work, the novel Added Upon, in 1898, to wide acclaim and popularity. At his death, a local newspaper exclaimed that Added Upon had \\"been read by almost every person in [Utah].\\" _Nephi Anderson Called by Death_ , Box Elder News Journal, 9 January, 1923 During the last three decades of his life, Anderson would write ten novels and numerous short stories, all involving LDS characters and storyline.

Originally published in 1898 by Deseret News Publishing Company and significantly enlarged and expanded in its fifth edition (1912), the book has never been out of print (its copyright expired in 2005, at which time it began to be re-printed by numerous online publishers). The story concerns several spirit children of God who move from the pre-existence, to mortal life, to their eternal reward, interacting with each other at each step. The novel influenced many subsequent Mormon works of literature, notably Saturday's Warrior. *Marcus King, Mormon (1900) *The Castle Builder (1902) *Piney Ridge Cottage (1912) *Story of Chester Lawrence (1913) *A Daughter of the North (1915) *John St. John (1917) *Romance of a Missionary (1919) *The Boys of Springtown (1920) *Dorian (1921) **A critical edition with scholarly notes, commentary, and analysis edited by Eric W.

She was built on the River Thames by C J Mare and launched on 13 August 1851. She spent twenty years in service, including action in the Crimean War and the Second Opium War, before being broken up at Portsmouth in May 1871. Design Highflyer was ordered as a small wooden frigate to a design by the Surveyor's Department of the Admiralty on 25 April 1847; she and her sister Esk were re-designated as corvettes in 1854. In common with other screw corvettes of the time, she was envisaged as a steam auxiliary, intended to cruise under sail with the steam engine available for assistance. Commensurately she was provided with a full square sailing rig. Her geared two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine, provided by Maudslay, Sons & Field, developed and drove a single screw. Construction The design was approved in November 1849, and she was laid down in January 1850 in the Leamouth Wharf yard of C J Mare & Co. on the River Thames. She was launched on 18 August 1851 and commissioned at Woolwich on 15 March 1852 under Captain Henry James Matson. The cost of building came to ¬£27,105 for the hull, ¬£17,431 for the machinery and ¬£11,539 for fitting out. Service history Highflyer at anchor off Soukoum Kaleh, Abasia, Omar Pasha leaving the Ship After commissioning, Highflyer completed fitting out on 10 April 1852. Initially she served on the North America and West Indies Station; her first commander, Captain Matson, died on 14 December 1852, and she was then placed under the command of Captain Edmund Heathcote. On 1 April 1853 command passed to Captain John Moore, under whom she sailed to join the Mediterranean Fleet after taking part in the 1853 Naval Review as part of the starboard division,. She was deployed in 1854 to the Black Sea during the Crimean War. After recommissioning at Portsmouth under Captain Charles Shadwell on 1 August 1856, she sailed for the China Station, where she took part in the Second Opium War. She was present at the capture of Canton in December 1857 and the Second Battle of Taku Forts on 25 June 1859. Midshipman John Fisher, later Baron Fisher of Kilverstone, served in her during the mid-1850s. Captain William Andrew James Heath took over command from Captain Shadwell on 2 January 1860, still in the Far East. Highflyer paid off at Portsmouth on 31 May 1861, but recommissioned again on 15 December 1864 under Captain Thomas Malcolm Sabine Pasley, for the Cape of Good Hope and East Indies Stations. There are references to service in the Persian Gulf - in January 1866, Highflyer bombarded a disputed fort at Al Zorah, in Ajman. She paid off for the last time on 31 August 1868 and was broken up at Portsmouth in May 1871.

Published in 1832, it is sometimes claimed as the first Canadian novel, although in fact it is preceded by Julia Catherine Beckwith's St Ursula's Convent; or, The Nun of Canada (Kingston, 1824). Wacousta is better categorized as the first attempt by a Canadian-born author at historical fiction. However, it is one of the first novels written by a Canadian-born author about Canada, and, in spite of its overwrought sentimentalism, it has been treated as a seminal work in the development of a Canadian literary sensibility. Its themes include prophecy and opposites, such as manliness vs. effeminacy, wilderness/wildness vs. civilization, sensibility vs. compassion and the natural vs. the supernatural among others. In the period of publication, Wacousta was quite popular not only in Canada, but also in the United States. A contemporary novel it competed with was James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans. Where they differ is that Cooper's novel focuses on the efforts of the individual within the whole, but Richardson's novel concerns itself with broader cross-cultural motivations.

Genesis Health System operates a hospital with two campuses in the city of Davenport, hospitals in the cities of Silvis, Illinois, DeWitt, Iowa, and Aledo, Illinois. Genesis Health System also manages Jackson County Regional Health Center in Maquoketa, Iowa. The President and CEO of Genesis Health System is Douglas Cropper. Genesis is the largest employer in Scott County, Iowa and the third largest in the Quad City area with 4900 employees.Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce History Genesis originally consisted of two hospitals that joined on May 24, 1994, to form the system. The two founding hospitals were Mercy Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, both in Davenport, Iowa. Mercy was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in response to an influenza outbreak in the area in 1869. Today, Genesis operates a total of five hospitals and manages Jackson County Regional Health Center in Maquoketa, IA. Mercy Hospital Established by Mother Mary Borromeo Johnson and the Sisters of Mercy, Mercy Hospital received its first patient on Dec. 7, 1869. In 1872, St. Elizabeth's Hospital for the Mentally Ill was opened adjacent to Mercy Hospital. Because of the 1918 flu pandemic, Mercy Hospital was forced to open an extension in Turner Hall in order to accommodate the ill. In 1924, Mercy Hospital was one of the first hospitals accredited by the American College of Surgeons. In 1932, a new wing was opened at Mercy Hospital. In 1954, a new facility replaced the original building. The idea to merge Mercy Hospital and St. Luke's was introduced in 1973, but was initially rejected. Another new Mercy Hospital was constructed 1978, with the construction of medical office buildings following just two years later in 1980. In order to fit the needs of a growing patient population, Mercy Hospital announced plans to expand again in 1987. In 1993, the boards of St. Luke's and Mercy Hospital agreed to merge. The merger was completed in 1994. St. Luke's Hospital Founded in 1893 at the corner of 8th and Main Street in Davenport, St. Luke's Hospital mainly acted as an emergency care facility. In 1914, St. Luke's relocated to East Rusholme Street, the current location of Genesis Medical Center, East Campus. In 1951 and again in 1964, additions to the new St. Luke's facility were completed. St. Elizabeth's Fire On 7 January 1950, a fire destroyed St. Elizabeth's Hospital for the Mentally Ill, killing 41 individuals and injuring 24 others, the majority of which were patients. According to most sources, the fire was caused by Elnora \\"Ellie\\" Epperly, a 23-year-old patient who, believing that her husband was in trouble and that she needed to escape, lit curtains with a cigarette lighter. Initially charged with murder, Elnora Epperly never faced trial after an inquest ruled that she was insane and thus not responsible for her actions. After spending the next several months in an Illinois hospital, Ellie was released into the custody of her husband, John. Now the location of Genesis Medical Center, West Central Park, a small cemetery has been erected in honor of those who died as a result of St. Elizabeth's fire. Sixteen of the 41 victims are buried at the site. Locations=Genesis Medical Center, Davenport Consisting of two different campuses, the East and West locations operate within relation to one another, combining approximately 450 physicians, 3,100 staff members and 1,000 volunteers. Both facilities offer a number of services including emergency room care, physical therapy, and diagnostic imaging. In December 2013, Genesis announced a $138.5 million expansion to add a new hospital tower to its East campus (former St. Luke's) to integrate certain medical services onto one campus. The project is expected to be completed in 2017.Quad City Times Genesis Medical Center, Silvis Genesis Medical Center, Silvis Campus is a 150-bed, full-service, acute care medical center, providing both inpatient and outpatient services while maintaining a level II trauma center. Like the East campus in Davenport, the facility also features a birthing unit. Genesis Medical Center, DeWitt Opened in 1952, DeWitt offers a variety of both inpatient and outpatient services, contrary to the fact that it is considered a rural hospital. In 2012, DeWitt was given the \\"Summit Award\\" by Press Ganey Associates, a merit that recognizes hospitals that have sustained the highest level of customer satisfaction for three or more consecutive years. Genesis Medical Center, Aledo Having joined the health system in 2013, Aledo is a 22-bed, critical access hospital. Because it is the only hospital in the county, the facility offers a number of outpatient and inpatient services, including emergency room care. Genesis Health Group Genesis Health Group is a regional network of physicians and primary care providers who are associated with Genesis Health System. There are over 160 associated physicians and 40 offices within Genesis Health Group, serving a similar area to what is served by Genesis Health System.

History After a Benedictine monastery was founded about 1000 AD, more monasteries followed. In 1404, Ludovico Barbo, the commendatory prior of a monastery of Augustinian friars on the island which was almost abandoned, gave the monastery to a small community of canons leading a contemplative life. The canons of the monastery instituted reforms to the canonical life which were quickly adopted in other communities of canons throughout the region. Soon they became the head of a congregation known as the Canons Regular of San Giorgio in Alga.Catholic encyclopedia One of Barbo's reforms was to allow the canons to sleep in separate cells to provide more opportunity for solitary prayer.The church in Italy in the fifteenth century by Denys Hay 2002 page 76 In 1717 a fire burnt most of the buildings on the island. As of 1799 there was a political prison, but nowadays the island is completely abandoned. The island was used in 1944 as a secret base for German military personnel training under the auspices of Italian Lt-Cmdr Wolk to master mine laying against Allied ships as free-diving frogmen.

History Santa Maria della Grazia rose during the Middle Ages in the place where Venice‚Äôs rubble was discarded. The island takes its name from a supposedly miraculous Madonna which was on display in its former church. In 1264 there was a home for pilgrims to the Holy Land; later it was transformed into a convent. During the Napoleonic period the convent was suppressed and changed to a powder-magazine, which in 1849 exploded destroying both the ex-convent and the church. The island was the site of an infectious diseases hospital until the end of the twentieth century.

Towards the end of his life he moved to Naples, where he sculpted portrait busts. He died in Naples during a plague epidemic.G. Tiraboschi. Early life Bolgi was born in the marble-working city of Carrara.His early biography is in Lione Pascoli, Vite de' pittori, scultori ed architetti... (1736) vol. ii, 436-39, and in G.-B. Passeri, Vite de' pittori, scultori ed architetti... (1772), Jacob Hess, ed. (1934). His training was in Florence, which was a conservative center in the seventeenth century. In 1626, along with Francesco Baratta, he was sent to Rome, where he joined the studio of sculptors employed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini,Rudolf Wittkower, Bernini, passim. who were influenced by Bernini's Baroque style. From 1626, before the expansion of Bernini's at√©lier, Bolgi supplanted Giuliano Finelli (1601‚Äì1653) as the \\"only man of consequence\\" in Bernini's studio, Rudolph Wittkower observed, in attributing to Bolgi the Bust of Thomas Baker begun by Bernini, now at the Victoria and Albert Museum.R. Wittkower, \\"Bernini Studies ‚Äì II: The 'Bust of Mr Baker'\\", The Burlington Magazine 95 No. 598 (January 1953:18‚Äì22). St. Peter's Bolgi created his Saint Helena (1629‚Äì1639) for one of the niches at the crossing of St. Peter's Basilica, one of the choice commissions of his generation, for which he had doubtless been promoted by Bernini in preference to Finelli.Wittkower 1953:21. Bolgi laboured for a decade on the figure that epitomised his career and, in some degree, his detraction: Wittkower remarked on its \\"classicizing coolness, its boring precision\\",Wittkower, Art and Architecture... (1973:306) and its position directly across from Bernini's masterful Saint Longinus invited unflattering comparisons.Robert Enggass, \\"New Attributions in St. Peter's: The Spandrel Figures in the Nave\\" The Art Bulletin 60.1 (March 1978:96‚Äì108) p. 100, quotes Roberto Cicognara's negative assessment in 1824. Between 1647 and 1650 all the spandrel spaces above the arches of the nave of St. Peter's were filled with stucco figures. Their execution was divided among sculptors with connections with Bernini, who seems to have exercised loose control over the compositions. In the first bay on the left, the spandrel figures of The Church and Divine Justice were given to Bolgi, who was paid for them in September 1647 and in March 1648. Pope Innocent X was dissatisfied with Bolgi's figures, which were taken down, adjusted to everyone's satisfaction, and reinstalled Enggass 1978: 96‚Äì108) pp 99‚Äì101. Naples After 1650 Bolgi moved to Naples, where he was noted for his portrait busts.; He was called to Naples by Giovan Camillo Cacace, a lawyer and member of the Accademia degli Oziosi. For this client Bolgi created two sculptures in the Cacace family chapel in San Lorenzo Maggiore. The kneeling figures are Giuseppe and Vittoria De Caro. Iconographically they derive from the scheme of the statue of Fabrizio Pignatelli by Michelangelo Naccherino. The movement and whirling of the cloths is a clear step forward in the development of the Baroque language, until then not known to the Neapolitan public. Beneath the sculptures are busts of Francesco De Caro and Giovan Camillo Cacace. The latter is renowned for its vivid portrayal of the client.

But I sought God through the Scripture. That‚Äôs when I got into the Bible myself.‚ÄùTranscript. Larry King Live. Early ministry: Bible Study Fellowship In 1975, Lotz heard about Bible Study Fellowship, a Bible class for women that used a highly structured study method, and wanted a class to be offered in her hometown of Raleigh.Kent, Keri Wyatt. \\"A Reverent Maverick.\\" She waited for a year for someone else to teach the class, but when no one else did, she decided to teach the class herself. The class immediately filled up with 500 people and had a waiting list.UNC-TV. \\"Best of People: Anne Graham Lotz.‚Äù Lotz continued to teach the weekly class for 12 years. During this time, she began to receive many speaking invitations and in 1988, Lotz left BSF for an itinerant teaching ministry. AnGeL Ministries Upon leaving her BSF teaching class, Lotz founded AnGeL Ministries, a non-profit organization based in Raleigh, NC to undergird her ability to accept teaching invitations. Lotz says the name \\"AnGeL Ministries\\" takes her initials \\"AGL\\" and adds the \\"n\\" and \\"e\\" to form the word \\"AnGeL\\" because \\"angels in the Bible were messengers of God, and they went where God sent them and they give the message you put on their heart, and I felt that describes what I do.\\" In the early years of AnGeL Ministries, Lotz accepted invitations to speak all over the world: at pastor's conferences, at women's conferences, and world evangelism conferences. By the year 2000, she felt her ministry taking a different direction. Although as a female evangelist she's encountered some resistance from conservative Protestants, her popularity is such that she draws large crowds across the world, and the New York Times in 1999 considered her one of the five most influential evangelists in the United States. Just Give Me Jesus revivals In the late 1990s, though AnGeL Ministries was growing, Lotz's personal life became very stressful. Within two years, a hurricane devastated their property, her husband's dental office burned to the ground, their son was diagnosed with cancer and went through major surgery and radiation, all three of her children got married within an eight-month period, and her mother's health was failing, requiring multiple hospitalizations. Once again, Lotz turned to her study of Scripture for comfort. This time, she immersed herself in the Gospel of John and from that study, came her book Just Give Me Jesus. Having experienced a personal revival herself as the result of her study of John, Lotz felt called to begin offering Just Give Me Jesus revivals in major arenas, both domestically and internationally for women who also desired a renewing of their walk with God. Though the revivals are aimed at teaching women, men are not turned away should they desire to come, and there is no admission charge for anyone. Publishing In addition to her itinerant teaching ministry, Lotz is author to 11 books, including her signature book, Just Give Me Jesus.A. Larry Ross. Online Newsroom: Anne Graham Lotz.

The doctrine of the spiritual body Many western and Eastern traditions share a common doctrine on a spiritual and immortal body which represent the ultimate goal of many ascetical works.Henry Corbin, Spiritual Body & Celestial Earth: From Mazdean Iran to Shi'ite Iran. Princeton University Press, 1977. This concept of a spiritual and immortal body which has to be formed has many names according to several traditions. Sometimes the idea of such an immortal body has been called the resurrection body and the glorified body in Christianity, the most sacred body (wujud al-aqdas) and supracelestial body (jism asli haqiqi) in Sufism, the diamond body in Taoism and Vajrayana, the light body or rainbow body in Tibetan Buddhism, the body of bliss in Kriya Yoga, and the immortal body (soma athanaton) in Hermeticism. It has to be specified that each of these names belongs to a different tradition, and every tradition has its own doctrine that differs from the others, so these terms cannot be entirely identified with one another; nevertheless, all of these currents share a common teaching which is the idea of the formation, under special ascetical or supernatural conditions, of an immortal and spiritual body. Properties of the body of resurrection Focusing on the resurrection body, which means a spiritual body in an Esoteric Christian framework, we can find some properties of these bodies which are shared by all the esoteric Christian movements. Indeed according to Biblical Scriptures, the resurrected bodies possess several properties:Tommaso Palamidessi, Propierties and Endowments of Resurrected Bodies *immortalityI Corinthians, 15:53Luke, 20:35Revelation, 21:4 *entirety, implying the restitution of the limbs, the distinction of the sexes and the perfection of the senses; *the excellent physique and physical beauty (natural prerogative). *incorruptibility, freedom from decay, or impassibility, freedom from pain, deriving from the perfect submission of the body to the soul Isaiah, 25:8; 69:10Rev. 7:16-17; 21:4) *clarity or glory: the bodies of saints will reflect the light, the inner splendor of the soul, therefore, in the body they will conform to the Incarnate Word;Matthew, 13:43;Wisdom,3:7Daniel, 12:3 *agility, so that the body of the saint, once free from the natural heaviness (imponderability), will be able to move rapidly from one place to another in the cosmos;Isaiah,60:31St. Augustine, Serm. 242:3 *subtility, the faculty to penetrate everything: the glorious body penetrates, without difficulty nor mutual damage, the other bodies in the Universe. The resurrection bodies, according to almost all the esoteric Christian currents, will be taken for sure at the end of the time when there will be the resurrection of all the bodies of the dead, good and bad, to be judged by Jesus Christ and receive eternal reward or eternal punishment.Matthew, 22:23-32Luke, 20:27Acts, 4:1-2Acts, 3:8Tommaso Palamidessi, Resurrection according to Esoteric Christianity , ed Archeosofica, 1969 In addition, most esoteric Christian traditions believe that the resurrection body or glorified body can be achieved during this lifetime with special ascetic exercises (which can vary between distinct esoteric movements) or as a supernatural gift. Guardian of the Threshold and the resurrection body In some modern esoteric Christian and theosophical oriented doctrines the resurrection body is related to the Guardian of the Threshold.Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889Rudolf Steiner, Building Stones for an Understanding of the Mystery of Golgotha: Lectures,Rudolph Steiner Pr, 1972Max Heindel, Gleaning of a Mystic,Rosicrucian Fellowship, 1919 Although several authors spoke about both of these elements and sometimes they even relate them together (cfr. Rudolf Steiner, Max Heindel, etc...) the most developed theory explaining the relation between these two entities in a theosophical framework is probably due to Tommaso Palamidessi. In his, The Guardian of the Threshold and the evolutionary way, Palamidessi identifies the spectral entity called the lesser Guardian of the Threshold with the archetype of the future resurrection body.Tommaso Palamidessi, The Guardian of the Threshold and the evolutionary way, ed Archeosofica, 1969 In this line of thought the lesser Guardian of the Threshold has to be purified, constructed and molded to become the resurrection body of the individual.

The portrait is located in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. \\"Maravilla Americana\\" are the first two words of the document's title. The full title in Spanish is Maravilla americana, y conjunto de raras maravillas, observadas con la direccion de las reglas de el arte de la pintura en la prodigiosa imagen de Nuestra Sra. de Guadalupe de Mexico (1695-1768). Cabrera received extensive praise for Maravilla Americana throughout Europe from artists and clergymen. Pope Benedict XIV described the commentary with a quote from Psalm 147:20: ‚ÄúNon fecit taliter omni nationi‚Äù (God‚Äôs done nothing like it for any other nation). History In 1751, the Chapter of the Basilica asked Cabrera and six other master painters to evaluate the Guadalupan Portrait from an artistic standpoint; specifically, describing the materials and pictorial technique used by the painter. After fulfilling this request and presenting a report, Cabrera felt inspired to extend it on his own. As a professional courtesy, he required a signed opinion of his work from his six colleagues, six professional statements which were also printed in both languages. Chapters Maravilla Americana is divided into eight chapters: Chapter I \\"On the Awesome Durability of the Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\". In Chapter 1, Cabrera discusses the durability of the portrait fibers, which had not degraded in more than 225 years. He took special note of the very thin cotton thread that united both parts of the ayate, which by itself couldn't resist the least force, remaining in place. Cabrera concluded that the fibers had lasted because the \\"Holy Image\\" of the saint was stamped on them. Chapter II \\"As to the Cloth or Canvas on Which Our Lady is Depicted\\". In Chapter 2, Cabrera analyzes the source of the portrait fibers. One possibility is that the fibers derive from palm trees. He dismisses the maguey plant as being too coarse for use in a portrait. Cabrera also suggests that the fiber is a middle quality European twine known as ‚Äúcotense‚Äù. He concludes: ‚ÄúWhat excites admiration is the softness to the touch, it feels like silk‚Äù. But the fiber certainly doesn‚Äôt look like silk! To the sight the woof is coarse, the quality is middle. Chapter III \\"On the total absence of priming in this painting\\". In Chapter 3, Cabrera, said that the Guadalupan Portrait does not contain any varnish primer. This is normally required on a painting canvas; painting on a coarse fabric without varnish is impossible. Chapter IV \\"On the marvellous drawing of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\". In Chapter 4, Carbrera remarks on the fine quality of the Guadalupan portrait drawing: ‚ÄúIt is unmatched; and so perfectly finished, and marvellous, that I‚Äôm fully certain that whoever with elementary knowledge of the principles of this art, on seeing it, will exceed himself in eloquence to make this portent known as miraculous‚Äù. After a long eulogy, he describes the drawing in detail. Chapter V \\"On the four different schools of painting which concur marvellously in the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\". It would be a great monstrosity to find in nature a being composed of four different animal species; no less do I consider a painting of which, in a single canvass, four different species of painting concurred in its single surface. However, this which to a human artist would be dissonant and even tasteless, we see here divinely practiced in this virginal canvass with such grace and beauty, that no matter how much I wished to exaggerate, I could never say as much as it by itself conveys to the onlooker‚Äôs eyes. More than human was the hand‚Ä¶etc. The four species or ways of painting are: in oil, in tempera, in gouache and in fresco‚Ä¶And after explaining each with its difficulty, and total lack of precedent for a single surface to the point that before Guadalupe no one could have imagined it, he says: ‚Äúto me, its so efficacious, that it persuades me of its miraculous character.‚Äù Chapter VI \\"On the precious gold and exquisite gilding of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe\\". In Chapter 6, Cabrera discuss the strange color of the portrait gilding. He is very impressed that the gold seems to be fused into the fibers themselves: ‚Äú...because I noticed that all that‚Äôs gilded is so united to the canvass, that to the touch it can be only be felt by the concavity as if it were printed; a matter for weighty consideration, as there‚Äôs no material in the canvas of the type used for gilding... The Holy Image has its tunic gilded with some flowers of strange design. They are composed of a golden vein with the peculiarity that they follow not the pleats and undulations, but are continuous as if on a flat surface‚Ä¶‚Äù Chapter VII \\"Considerations on the objections against the esthetical perfection of the Image\\". In Chapter 7, Cabrera refutes Art criticism that claims the portrait violates what are called the \\"rules of painting\\": ‚ÄúThe most thorough and efficacious answer to all objections presented or possible is the image itself, as I know that when attentively observed, the sharpest eyes will find no less than the complete achievement of the most perfect whole that painting ever admired.‚Äù Chapter VIII \\"On the design of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\\" Footnotes Category:Our Lady of Guadalupe Category:Books about visual art ","title":"Maravilla Americana"},{"id":"13368366","text":"Under Secretary Richard Raymond Richard Allen Raymond was Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety from 2005-2009. His nomination was announced and sent to the Senate on May 26, 2005. He was confirmed on July 1 and appointed on July 18. Education and career Before joining the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Richard Raymond was director of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services Regulation & Licensure division where he oversaw regulatory programs involving health care and environmental issues. He had been appointed to the position on October 16, 2004 by then-Nebraska governor Mike Johanns. He was also Nebraska's Chief Medical Officer; he had been appointed to that position in January 1999. Raymond graduated from Hastings College and earned his medical degree from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. For 17 years, he practiced medicine in rural Nebraska. There, he established and directed a community-based Family Practice Residency for Clarkson Medical Center. He served as president of the Nebraska Medical Association, chaired Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns' Blue Ribbon Panel on Infant Mortality, and served on numerous state committees related to public health. He was also president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and has been a member of the association's Preparedness Committee for three years. Under Secretary for Food Safety In November 2005, Richard Raymond was interviewed by the Washington Post, which had christened him the \\"germ czar,\\" on the subject of Thanksgiving food safety. In May 2006, he appeared in television and radio advertisements seeking to ease concerns about the bird flu, saying, \\"It's important for you to know that it‚Äôs safe to eat poultry, even if bird flu is detected here sometime in the future.\\" In October 2006, he criticized the idea of combining multiple agencies into a single agency responsible for food safety as an \\"unnecessary solution.\\" In December 2006, he disputed a report by Consumer Reports in which 83% of chickens they tested were infected with campylobacter and/or salmonella bacteria, noting that the sample of 500 chickens tested was \\"very small.\\" In February 2007, Richard Raymond ordered stepped-up inspections at some meat and poultry plants where the threat of E. coli is high or past visits found unsafe practices. On the subject of China's banning of pork containing ractopamine, he said that he hoped Beijing could change its stance if the Codex Alimentarius Commission, an international food safety body, could endorse tolerance levels for it.

EWV) is the standard approach used in Germany for the valuing of property that produces a stream of future cash flows.  Basic principles and regulations  The EWV is one of three valuation methods codified by German legislation. The Vergleichswertverfahren (sales comparable approach) is mainly used to determine the value of owner-occupied buildings (single-family houses, condominiums) and land. The Sachwertverfahren (cost approach) is only used for special use properties that do not produce a measurable future cash flow. Subsequently, the EWV is used for the vast majority of appraisals. Even though the EWV is mostly consistent with international practice, there are some important differences: *Land and improvements are treated separately. German Generally Accepted Valuation Principles (GAVP) assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but that buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the Gutachterausschuss (local valuation committees, lit. \\"expert committees\\") which is then added to the building value. *In order to account for the usage of the land by the buildings occupying it, the net operating income is reduced by the Liegenschaftszins (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The Liegenschaftszins is the product of the land value and the Liegenschaftszinssatz (interest rate for land-use). The Liegenschaftszinssatz is the equivalent of the yield ‚àí with some important differences ‚àí and is determined by the Gutachterausschuss. *Unlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the Liegenschaftszinssatz (LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), and therefore this should be subtracted from gross operating income. As a result, the Liegenschaftszinssatz will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield. *Based on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value through the net operating income. *It should be additionally noted that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK. Real estate appraisal in Germany is regulated by the federal Baugesetzbuch (abbr. BauGB, the German statutory code of building and construction).Definition of market value in German This federal law is supported by the Wertermittlungsverordnung (abbr. WertV, \\"regulation on the determination of value\\"). The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. WertV's general regulations are further supported by the Wertermittlungsrichtlinie (abbr. WertR, \\"directive on the determination of value\\"). The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for non-official use, nonetheless they should be regarded as best practice or German Professional Appraisal Practice (PAP).  Determination of value drivers = Building condition and useful life  The condition of the building has a direct effect on the valuation. First of all it has to be determined whether the building has a maintenance backlog. If so, the cost for resolving this backlog (usually referred to as capex) has to be calculated and will later on be subtracted from the value. This calculation has to be made under the assumption that it correlates with the assumed rental income and also has to take into effect the building's age. Secondly, major refurbishment or upgradings have to be taken into account, as they can extend the duration of the building's useful life. German literature and the semi- official Normalherstellungskosten 2000 (abbr. NHK 2000, \\"Normal Production Costs\\") provide detailed information on the useful life span, which is generally judged to be 60‚Äì80 years for multiple dwellings and 50‚Äì80 years for office buildings. It must be stressed that the useful life span needs to be applied with due regard to the economic environment, whereas the technical life span may be indefinite. Towards the end of its useful life, the building's value is understood to decrease sharply, as either a new building or a major refurbishment will be necessary to generate rental income in the long run. Therefore a recent major refurbishment (outer shell, rentable areas, HVACR, etc.) can significantly increase the building's remaining useful life, depending on the scope of the refurbishment and assuming that other considerations such as layout and energy consumption do not confound the effort. Contaminations of the building with asbestos or other harmful materials might also affect the total value; this is usually accounted for by subtracting the decontamination costs from the building's value.  Land value  In order to separately determine the value of the land, an appraiser in Germany will usually will use the information gathered by the Gutachterausschuss (GA). Most GAs will publish market reports every two years, including Bodenrichtwertkarten (land value guide maps). It is also possible to directly contact the local GA and ask for land value data on a specific plot of land. The following must be taken into account when utilising a given comparable: *The comparable must be nearby or, when referring to a land value zone, the subject of the valuation must be within or nearby the respective zone; *The type of use (residential, office, retail, industrial, etc.) should be in line with that of the subject of the valuation; *The degree of utilisation - measured in gross floor area or gross volume area - must be made comparable by use of appropriate conversion coefficients; *The size of the parcel of land must be taken into account. Further on the appraiser has to check if there are additional factors that will influence the land value. These might be site development costs, contamination, right-of-way or other rights etc. These have to be taken into account in an appropriate manner.  Yield  The yield, which in German valuation practice is known as the Liegenschaftszinssatz, is a crucial value driver, as it will be used to determine the Liegenschaftszins (a notional rent subtracted from the building's net operating income in order to account for the usage of the economic good \\"land\\"). Moreover, together with the residual life span, it mathematically determines the multiplier that is used to calculate the building's value. Again, the Gutachteraussch√ºsse will provide information on the yield. By empirical analysis of the purchase price data base, the GA stipulates the local yield by type of use. Alas, a widespread problem is that some GAs in smaller municipalities do not carry out these analyses and thus do not publish yield data. In that case the appraiser has to fall back on a combination of nationwide yield data, market research and experience. During the past few years, yields for residential assets (multiple dwellings) were usually within the range of four to five percent, depending on local market conditions. Yields for office buildings should mostly be in the range of five to six percent, while yields for retail and logistics buildings will be accordingly higher. The determined basic yield (for type of usage and municipality) should always be analysed further, as under or above average liquidity, lay of the land or the floor plans, should be taken into account by way of a deduction or premium of 25 or 50 basis points for each respective factor.  Gross income  Needless to say, the Rohertrag (gross income) is the most important value driver for real estate which produces future cash flows. The EWV is basically a static model, meaning that a sustainable income is treated as stable in the future. The appraiser will form his (or her) opinion on the basis of the existing leases, while also considering the market rent. In commercial real estate such as office or retail buildings, the existing leases usually determine the sustainable income, as long as the lease contracts are long-term and the tenant has a good credit rating. If this is not the case, then the appraiser must rely on his or her knowledge of the market, as well as his experience regarding future lease contracts. Possible incentives must also be accounted for. In contrast to commercial real estate, residential lease contracts are highly codified by the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (abbr. BGB, \\"German civil code\\"). One of the central ideas there regarding real estate, is the Orts√ºbliche Vergleichsmiete (local customary comparable rent). New leases must not be more than 20 percent (not exactly stated by BGB, depending on the jurisdiction) higher than the local customary comparable rent, or the rental contracts may be nullified. Within existing lease contracts, rent increases (i) must not exceed the local customary comparable rent, (ii) are only allowed for if the rent has not increased for the past 15 months, and (iii) must not exceed a total increase of 20 percent within three years.BGB articles 557 ff. on rent increases To conclude, the determination of the sustainable rent for residential assets should be made on conservative premises and in close correlation with the current rents. Experience shows that foreign investors have in the past tended to underestimate the effects of such legislation. The sustainable rent, determined as described above, will be treated as stable and will form the basis of the irredeemable. However, it is possible to allow for over or under rents in the short run. The difference between this and the sustainable rent should be discounted and the resulting value should be added or subtracted to the building value (this approach is in some ways comparable to the hard core/layer method employed in UK practice). A special case is the existence of struktureller Leerstand (long-term or structural vacancy) resulting from an imbalance in the market or from unfavourable characteristics of the subject property. If this is the case, determination of the sustainable rent will not assume a fully rented property, but instead will allow for a certain level of permanent vacancy. Additional income e.g. from mobile phone antennae must also be included in the gross income.  Expenses  German GAVP (especially the WertV) breaks down the Bewirtschaftungskosten (operating expenses) into four types. It should be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK *The Heiz-, Betriebs- und Nebenkosten (\\"cost of heating and running costs\\"): Depending on the respective lease contracts, in commercial properties all costs can be and usually are passed on to the tenant. This is different in residential assets, because the Betriebskostenverordnung (abbr. BetrKV, \\"running costs regulation\\") stipulates which costs can and which costs cannot be passed on.BertKV Whereas costs of water, heating, caretaker, etc. can be passed on (energy companies usually bill costs for electricity directly to the tenant), other costs such as property tax and insurance cannot be reimbursed. Therefore in appraisals for residential properties a certain amount (ranging from 20 to 50 Eurocent per square metre per month) should be allowed for. *The Verwaltungskosten (\\"administrative costs\\"): These can be passed on in commercial leases, but not in residential leases. Management costs usually range from two to five percent of the gross income for commercial properties and between 15 and 20 Euro per month per residential unit in residential properties. If the building is held in co-operative ownership, the administrative costs are significantly higher. *The Instandhaltungskosten (maintenance costs): In commercial leases these can be reimbursed, if the contract is formulated accordingly. Most contracts however leave the costs of maintenance of the outer shell to the owner. With residential real estate the owner has to allow for the maintenance costs. In order to determine the exact numbers, the appraisal should also take into consideration how high the fluctuation is and if cosmetic repairs are agreed upon. Standard projections for maintenance costs vary widely from four to 20 Euro per square meter per year. *The Mietausfallwagnis (allowance for rental loss): As described in the introduction, in German GAVP a rental loss (income from existing leases that is lost due to poor economic situation of the tenant) is allowed for as an expense. This might look strange in comparison to US or UK practice, but it has the advantage that the loss can be allowed for in quite a precise manner. It is usually calculated on the basis of existing numbers. In well-managed residential properties it should not be higher than two percent, in commercial properties three to four percent (depending on tenant structure).  Calculation procedures  After the determination of the value drivers, the calculation procedure itself is rather simple.  Calculation of the value of land  The value of the land is calculated by multiplying the land value (after adjustments) with the size of the land. Surplus land has to be looked at separately, as this is a special case. Potential decontamination costs or other effects influencing the value are taken into account by an appropriate premium or deduction.  Calculation of the value of the building  The Jahresreinertrag (\\"net annual operating income\\" (NOI)) is determined by subtracting the yearly expenses from the gross income. In a next step, the notional ground rent is allowed for. This so- called Liegenschaftszins (\\"rent for land use\\") is determined by multiplying the land value with the yield (after adjustments). The resulting yearly sum is subtracted from the result of the previous step. In order to transform the yearly NOI into the building value, the multiplier is mathematically (or by use of tables provided by the WertR) determined from the residual usage period and the yield (after adjustments). The product of the multiplier and the NOI determines the building value. This building value can be adjusted by premiums or deductions for maintenance backlog, harmful material, over or under rent etc. The resulting figure is the adjusted value of the building.  Consolidation  The addition of land value and building value (improvements) results in the property value. WertV article 19 offers the possibility of making final adjustments for any circumstances not taken into account in the previous steps. However, any additional adjustments should be explicitly stated.  Formal aspects  A good appraisal report should be transparent and comprehensible. The determination of the value drivers should be well- documented and referenced, so that an expert reader may be able to quickly assess the report's quality. Most appraisal reports are structured as follows: *Introduction, date of valuation, customer and purpose of the valuation; *Documentation of land register and other legal factors; *Description of land and improvements; *Analysis of the market situation and rental contracts; *Documentation of the determination of value drivers; *Calculation and value statement; *Appendix with photo documentation.  Conclusion  From a theoretical point of view, the German income approach contains some interesting specifics: Even though in the determination of gross rental income it is quite similar to the US income approach, in its apportionment of income between land and improvements, which allows for the building's limited useful life-span to be taken into account, it also contains elements of the discounted cash flow approach. German PAP generally advises to rely on existing numbers, but allows to fall back on empirical values and experience when needed. Being highly standardised, the Ertragswertverfahren - when applied professionally - offers the reader of the report the opportunity to quickly examine and assess its underlying assumptions.

For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. The parish includes Stowbridge and Barroway Drove.  History  The village name evolved from the Old English st≈çw - place; a place of assembly; a holy place - to which was added the surname Bardolf. This was almost certainly because of connections with the Lords Bardolf of nearby Wormegay Castle. The Stow Bardolph estate was purchased by the Hare family in 1553. At least three Stow Halls have existed on the estate, the original was built around 1589 by Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, but fell into disrepair and was demolished. The second Stow Hall was built around 1796, but this too fell into disrepair and was demolished. The third Stow Hall was built around 1874 and served as a stately home until 1939. From 1940 to 1980 the house was used by the local health authority as a maternity hospital and was demolished in 1994 when it was found to be beyond economic repair. Holy Trinity Parish Church was extensively restored by John Raphael Rodrigues Brandon around 1850. A wax effigy of the upper body of Sarah Hare including lifelike face and hands is displayed upright in a mahogany case in the Hare Chapel of the church. Hare died from blood poisoning in 1744 at the age of 55. Her will stated she wished to be recreated in wax following her death. It is the only funerary effigy of its kind outside Westminster Abbey.

Military service, World War I Henke's military service began in 1914 as a cadet with a pioneer battalion. He was promoted to officer in 1915, but in 1916 was seriously wounded and unable to return to frontline service. Posted to Libau, he became involved in developing landing operations, an area in which he specialised for the remainder of his career. Continuing to serve with the Reichswehr and then the Wehrmacht, by 1939 Henke had been promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. Military service, World War II On September 1, 1939, Henke was involved in the first major battle of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland, the Battle of Westerplatte, where he led the assault engineer company. Henke was intended to lead Operation Nordlicht, the attempt to take Leningrad in 1942, but when this was cancelled was transferred to the Crimea, where the Seventeenth Army was eventually trapped by Soviet forces. Here, Henke organised the evacuation of troops across the Strait of Kerch, an action for which he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and from the Kuban bridgehead. Promoted to Major-General, and appointed the senior commander of Wehrmacht landing operations, Henke oversaw the evacuation of German troops from islands in the Baltic Sea and from Estonia late in 1944. From January 1945 Henke became responsible for the supply of Fourth Army, trapped in the Heiligenbeil pocket in East Prussia. In this role he was in part responsible for the evacuation of up to a million civilians from East Prussia and through the port of Pillau, which was retained as long as possible; on 24 April, he was placed in command of the 290th Infantry Division, which had been transported by sea from the Courland Pocket. Henke and his unit finally abandoned Pillau on 25 April for the nearby Batterie Lehmberg fortifications at Neutief (Noytif was Russian correspondence of Neutef before 1946) Baltijskas Neutief village's present name is found in Lithuanian article of Baltiyskhttp://vddb.library.lt/fedora/get/LT- eLABa-0001:J.04~2005~ISSN_1392-3137.N_1_30.PG_69-76/DS.002.1.01.ARTIC An article about tourism aim at Russian part of Vistula Spit on the Frische Nehrung.

King tide is not a scientific term, nor is it used in a scientific context. The expression originated in Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations to describe especially high tides that occur a few times per year. It is now used in North America as well, particularly in low-lying South Florida, where king tides can cause sunny day tidal flooding.  Definition King tides are the highest tides. They are naturally occurring, predictable events. Tides are the movement of water across Earth's surface caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun, and the rotation of Earth which manifest in the local rise and fall of sea levels. Tides are driven by the relative positions of the Earth, Sun, Moon, land formations, and relative location on Earth. In the lunar month, the highest tides occur roughly every 14 days, at the new and full moons, when the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun are in alignment. These highest tides in the lunar cycle are called spring tides. The proximity of the Moon in relation to Earth and Earth in relation to the Sun also has an effect on tidal ranges. The Moon moves around Earth in an elliptic orbit that takes about 29 days to complete. The gravitational force is greatest when the Moon is at perigee ‚Äî closest to Earth ‚Äî and least when it is at apogee ‚Äî farthest from Earth ‚Äî about two weeks after perigee. The Moon has a larger effect on the tides than the Sun, but the Sun's position also has an influence on the tides. Earth moves around the Sun in an elliptic orbit that takes a little over 365 days to complete. Its gravitational force is greatest when the Earth is at perihelion ‚Äî closest to the Sun in early January ‚Äî and least when the Earth is at aphelion ‚Äî farthest from the Sun in early July. The king tides occur when the Earth, Moon and Sun are aligned at perigee and perihelion, resulting in the largest tidal range seen over the course of a year. So, tides are enhanced when the Earth is closest to the Sun around January 2 of each year. They are reduced when it is furthest from the Sun, around July 2.Tidal Variations ‚Äî The Influence of Position and Distance NOAA ocean service education The predicted heights of a king tide can be further augmented by local weather patterns and ocean conditions.

The protests were triggered by the decision of the national military government to remove subsidies on the sales prices of fuel. The national government is the only supplier of fuels and the removal of the price subsidy immediately caused diesel and petrol prices to increase by 66‚Äì100% and the price of compressed natural gas for buses to increase 500% in less than a week. The various protests were led by students, political activists, including women, and Buddhist monks and took the form of a campaign of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance.Christina Fink, \\"The Moment of the Monks: Burma, 2007\\", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009. , pp. 354‚Äì370. In response to the protests dozens of protesters were arrested or detained. Starting in September 2007 the protests were led by thousands of Buddhist monks, and those protests were allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown in late September 2007.UN envoy warns of Myanmar crisis Some news reports referred to the protests as the Saffron Revolution, or (). The exact number of casualties from the 2007 protests is not known, but estimates range from 13‚Äì31 deaths resulting from either the protests or reprisals by the government. Several hundred people were arrested or detained, many (but not all) of whom were released. In the event, Senior General Than Shwe remained in power until he retired in 2011 at age 78. Terminology Protesting monks gathering at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon The phrase \\"Saffron Revolution\\" connects the protests against Myanmar's military dictatorship to the saffron-coloured robes widely associated with Buddhist monks, who were at the forefront of the demonstrations. The robes of Burmese monks are similar to the color of whole saffron. While similar terms for protests (see colour revolution) had been used elsewhere for the process of gradual or peaceful revolution in other nations, this seems to be the first time it has been associated with a particular protest as it was unfolding, and the international press seized upon the term in reporting on the Burmese protests.Mother Jones: Has Washington Found its Iranian Chalabi? 6 October 2006 However, the idea that the monkhood is connected to specifically Burmese ideas about revolution has been argued by British academic Gustaaf Houtman, partly in critique of an alternative view held by a political scientist, that Gen. Ne Win's 1962 revolution was the only successful revolution in Burma. Burmese concepts of \\"revolution\\", however, have a much longer history and are also employed in many but not all monastic ordinations. The military government of Burma was called the State Peace and Development Council or \\"SPDC\\" from 1988 to 2011. History= Background  Prior to the 2007 summer protests, there had been growing unease in the population regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest countries in the world according to the United Nations.Michael Casey, Monks Put Myanmar Junta in Tight Spot, Associated Press, 21 September 2007. Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the leadership of the military junta and the proportion of national income spent on the armed forces.The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest BBC, 2 October 2007 In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30‚Äì40%. According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year. Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a \\"state within a state\\", free from the economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country. Many of the high ranking army generals have become immensely rich; as witnessed in the video of the wedding of senior general Than Shwe's daughter, who is shown wearing diamonds worth many millions of dollars.The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest BBC News 2 October 2007Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired BBC, 2 November 2006 According to the BBC, on 22 February 2007, a small group of individuals protested the current state of consumer prices in the country. While the protest was small and careful not to be seen as directed at the military junta, officials jailed nine of the protesters. It was the first street protest seen in Rangoon for at least a decade. According to Jeff Kingston, in his article \\"Burma's Despair\\" stated that \\"Despair and fear are immobilizing a people who yearn for a better life and have fruitlessly risked much for a better government.\\" This shows how afraid the Burmese were to take action in 2007. Not only that but Kingston also states that \\"The earlier brutal crackdown of 1988-when at least three thousand protesters were killed and thousands more imprisoned and tortured-has burned a place in the collective memory.\\"(Kingston, J.(2007).Burma's Despair.

Some of the prominent or symbolic individuals who figured in these events included: *Senior General Than Shwe, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed forces *Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1991, *Kenji Nagai, Japanese photojournalist who was killed during the protests, *Zarganar, Burmese comedian and protester *U Gambira, a leader of the Buddhist monks in opposition. April 2007 The military junta detained eight people on Sunday, 22 April 2007, who took part in a rare demonstration in a Yangon suburb amid a growing military crackdown on protesters. A group of about ten protesters carrying placards and chanting slogans staged the protest Sunday morning in Yangon's Thingangyun township, calling for lower prices and improved health, education and better utility services. The protest ended peacefully after about 70 minutes, but plainclothes police took away eight demonstrators as some 100 onlookers watched. The protesters carried placards with slogans such as \\"Down with consumer prices\\". Some of those detained were the same protesters who took part in a downtown Yangon protest on 22 February 2007. That protest was one of the first such demonstrations in recent years to challenge the junta's economic mismanagement rather than its legal right to rule. The protesters detained in the February rally had said they were released after signing an acknowledgment of police orders that they should not hold any future public demonstrations without first obtaining official permission. The military government stated its intention to crack down on these human rights activists, according to a 23 April 2007, report in the country's official press. The announcement, which comprised a full page of the official newspaper, followed calls by human rights advocacy groups, including London-based Amnesty International, for authorities to investigate recent violent attacks on rights activists in the country. Two members of Human Rights Defenders and Promoters, Maung Maung Lay, 37, and Myint Naing, 40, were hospitalised with head injuries following attacks by more than 50 people while the two were working in Hinthada township, Irrawaddy Division in mid-April. On Sunday, 22 April 2007, eight people were arrested by plainclothes police, members of the pro-junta Union Solidarity and Development Association, and the Pyithu Swan Arr Shin (a paramilitary group) while demonstrating peacefully in a Yangon suburb. The eight protesters were calling for lower commodity prices, better health care and improved utility services. Htin Kyaw, 44, one of the eight who also took part in an earlier demonstration in late February in downtown Yangon, was beaten by a mob, according to sources at the scene of the protest. Reports from opposition activists emerged saying that authorities have directed the police and other government proxy groups to deal harshly with any sign of unrest in Yangon. \\"This proves that there is no rule of law [in Burma],\\" the 88 Generation Students group said in a statement. [Mon 23 April 2007] \\"We seriously urge the authorities to prevent violence in the future and to guarantee the safety of every citizen.\\"Irrawaddy: Burma's junta vows to crack down on human rights activists-Yeni BurmaNet News, 23 April 2007. Retrieved 23 April 2007. August 2007 ‚Äì Removal of fuel subsidies On 15 August 2007 the government removed subsidies on fuel causing a rapid and unannounced increase in prices. The government, which has a monopoly on fuel sales, raised prices from about $1.40 to $2.80 a gallon, and boosted the price of natural gas by about 500%. This increase in fuel prices led to an increase in food prices. Soon afterwards, protesters took to the streets to protest the current conditions. While the International Monetary Fund and World Bank had been recommending the lifting of subsidies for some time to allow for a free market to determine fuel prices,The Economic Factors Behind the Myanmar Protests these organisations did not recommend removing all of the subsidies unannounced. The fuel is sold by Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, a state-owned fuel company. August 2007 ‚Äì Initial demonstrations In response to the increase in fuel prices, citizens protested in demonstrations beginning on 19 August. In response to the protests, the government began arresting and beating demonstrators.

Their houses were searched without a warrant. These demonstrators could have been charged with up to one year in prison; under the 5/96 Law, that is used to condemn those who disrupt the stability of the state. September 2007 ‚Äì Escalation On 5 September 2007, Burmese troops forcibly broke up a peaceful demonstration in Pakokku and injured three monks. It was further reported that one monk was killed. This report however was never confirmed but quoted as a reason for the monks' protests starting on September 18. Document 6.1 The next day, younger monks in Pakokku briefly took several government officials hostage in retaliation.Q&A;: Protests in Burma BBC, 24 September 2007 They demanded an apology by the deadline of 17 September but the military refused to apologise. This sparked protests involving increasing numbers of monks in conjunction with the withdrawal of religious services for the military. Their role in the protests was significant due to the reverence paid to them by the civilian population and the military. After these events, protests began spreading across Myanmar, including Yangon (also known as Rangoon), Sittwe, Pakokku and Mandalay.Monks lead largest Burma protest BBC, 24 September 2007. On 22 September around two thousand monks marched through Yangon and ten thousand through Mandalay, with other demonstrations in five townships across Myanmar.

Although still under house arrest, Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of her residence to accept the blessings of the Buddhist monks. In Mandalay, estimated to have 200 monasteries, monks were said to have told people not to join the protests, which ended peacefully. As of 22 September 2007, the Buddhist monks were reported to have withdrawn spiritual services from all military personnel in a symbolic move that was seen as very powerful in such a deeply religious country as Burma. The military rulers seemed at a loss as to how to deal with the demonstrations by the monks as using violence against monks would incense and enrage the people of Burma even further, almost certainly prompting massive civil unrest and perhaps violence. However, the longer the junta allowed the protests to continue, the weaker the regime could look. The danger is that eventually the military government will be forced to act rashly and doing so will provoke the citizenry even more. Some international news agencies are referring to the uprising as a 'Saffron Revolution'. On 23 September, 150 nuns joined the protests in Yangon. On that day, some 15,000 Buddhist monks and laymen marched through the streets of Yangon in the sixth day of escalating peaceful protests against the Burmese military regime.Monks' protest swells Bangkok Post, 23 September 2007.

Set in 1919 it concerns the last case of occult-busters Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, H. P. Lovecraft, and voodoo queen Marie Laveau. Origins Thomas Wheeler intended to write a novel about the Spiritualist Movement featuring a world of s√©ances and shadows. The lead character was to embody the essence of the times, who would have the physical attributes of Houdini, the sleuthing skills of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creepy intellect of H. P. Lovecraft, and the otherworldly skill-set of a Marie Laveau. Eventually Wheeler decided to use the original personages, and create a new character, the enigmatic leader of the Arcanum ‚Äî Konstantin Duvall. Wheeler's brother suggested a vital element of the tale with the question: \\"Why can't it be their last adventure?\\"Thomas Wheeler Interview Plot summary The year is 1919 and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle must investigate the murder of his mentor (and founder of The Arcanum), Konstantin Duvall. To do so he must reunite the scattered members of the Arcanum: Harry Houdini, H. P. Lovecraft, and voodoo queen Marie Laveau. Doyle finds himself embroiled in a story of war as old as time itself, for possession of the world‚Äôs most powerful‚Äînow missing‚Äîartifact: the Book of Enoch, the chronicle of God‚Äôs mistakes, within whose pages lie the seeds for the end of everything. Peopled with the twentieth century‚Äôs most famous‚Äîand infamous‚Äîfigures, the stakes go beyond the realm of humankind‚Äîinto the divine.  Characters =Konstantin Duvall Duvall was a mage and a mystic, an explorer and collector of all things occult, and leader of the Arcanum. Also an advisor to presidents and czars. He kept many secrets, one of which, The Book of Enoch, the third part of the Bible that was thought to be erased from existence in the first century, was stolen from its hiding place by a practitioner of the dark arts. \\"He was the last of the great mystics, a remnant of the Middle Ages. He bore the likeness and courage of a Templar Knight, yet embraced the pervisions of an Inquisitor priest. He was as burnt- fingered and secretive as an alchemist, yet spoke dozens of languages, wrote manuscripts in cipher, and traveled the world with different identities, in the tradition of a court spy.\\" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Possessing the observational and deductive powers of his fictional creation, Sherlock Holmes, Doyle has served Queen and Country under the tutelage of Konstantin Duvall. As a member of the Arcanum, Doyle has been involved in many occult mysteries and was unhappy when the group disbanded. Harry Houdini Houdini has moved on from his time with the Arcanum and is now a world-famous escape artist. He is currently making movies that highlight his escape skills and would prefer to forget all about his past occult exploits. H. P. Lovecraft He was the Arcanum's youngest member, and is a leading authority on all matters of the occult. He was deeply hurt when the Arcanum disbanded and seems constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

They are within the civil parish of Nettlecombe, named after the house, and are approximately from the village of Williton, in the English county of Somerset. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The 16th-century Elizabethan, Tudor and Medieval architecture with Georgian refinements includes a mansion, Medieval hall, church, monumental oak grove, and a farm. It is surrounded by of estate parkland situated within the Exmoor National Park, once a part of the estate. It lays sheltered at the northeast incline of the Brendon Hills. The park surrounding the house is Grade II listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Nettlecombe Park blends into woodlands, with the house serving as the Leonard Wills Field Centre run by Field Studies Council and offering residential and non residential fieldwork for schools, colleges and universities, holiday accommodation and professional and leisure courses in natural history and arts. Today, nearby hills and woodlands, including Exmoor National Park, have provided opportunities for general scientific introductory field courses on environmental themes and botany. Habitats include marine, freshwater and heather moorland and the surrounding settlements range from hamlets to villages to the country town of Taunton. An archaeological excavation on the edge of the property, near the sea coast, has revealed the remains of Danish Vikings who were defeated there circa 900.  History  Nettlecombe Court in Somersetshire (1793). Engraved by W. Angus, after a picture by Smith. Nettlecombe was originally spelled Netelcumbe and by 1245 Nettelcumbe meaning the place or valley where the nettles grow. Nettlecombe has never been bought or sold. It was held before the Norman Conquest by Prince Godwine, son of King Harold. William the Conqueror assumed possession of Nettlecombe after defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. In 1160, Henry II granted it to Hugh de Raleigh, and to his heirs in perpetuity. It passed to Warine de Raleigh, and on through direct blood heirs until the 19th century, a claim strengthened by marriages between deep ancestral cousins. The estate became a seat of the Trevelyan baronets (previously spelled as Trevilian), who also held another manor at Basil, by the marriage of Sir John Trevilian in 1481 to Lady Whalesborough, heiress of Nettlecombe via her Raleigh maternal line. Nettlecombe was held in continuity by Trevilian successors until the 20th century following the death of Joan Trevelyan and her husband Garnet Wolsey. It became a boarding school for girls (St. Audries Junior School) in the late 1950s. Since 1967 it has been the home of the Leonard Wills Field Centre run by the Field Studies Council an educational charity. The house is surrounded by Nettlecombe Park, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).  House  Nettlecombe Court Field Studies Centre Nettlecombe Court is an Elizabethan country mansion, in addition to earlier-built structures including a late Medieval hall, entrance front, porch, a great hall, and church. A Tudor parlour was added in 1599. In the 1640s there were further additions to the rear of the great hall following a fire started by roundheads opposed to George Trevelyns support of the monarchy during the English Civil War. During the reign of George I, between 1703 and 1707, the South West front was extended. The south west wing was decorated in the 1780s and the north east service range was added in the early 19th century. The house contains plaster work from each of these eras. In the 17th century, an organ built by John Loosemore was installed, at a cost of ¬£100. This was converted from a single-manual to two-manual operation in the 1830s. In the 1980s, this was partly dismantled and the original parts removed to the John Loosemore Centre in Buckfastleigh, where they are still located, awaiting restoration.  Family  Arms of Trevelyan: Gules, the base barry wavy argent and azure a demi-horse issuant of the second maned and hoofed or As stated in Nettlecombe Court, compiled by R. J. E. Bush, \\"Nettlecombe is first mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086, when it was stated to be held by William the Conqueror, and in the charge of his Sheriff for Somerset, William de Mohun.\\" Ralegh-Raleigh: In the mid-12th century John, son of William the Marshall, gifted the manor of Nettlecombe to Hugh de Ralegh, a Norman knight; and the gift was confirmed by a charter of Henry II in 1156. Later in the 12th century Warrin de Ralegh, Hugh's nephew, built a manor house on the site now occupied by Nettlecombe Court. The Court's kitchen may have formed the original 12th-century Great Hall. Ralegh also built a small church beside the manor house. Generations of the Ralegh family are commemorated inside the church. The earliest memorial is an effigy of Sir Simon de Ralegh, labelled 1260. There is no written record found at Nettlecombe for Sir Simon de Ralegh in the family history. Sir Simon's effigy is dated 1260, which predates the first recorded rector of Nettlecombe by 37 years, owing to the gap in recording the earliest Ralegh names at the church of Nettlecombe Court. That rector was Will de Locombe (presumably a native of Luccombe, on the edge of Exmoor). A later generation of Raleghs are commemorated by the effigies of Sir John de Ralegh and his first wife, Maud, dated to 1360. The last Ralegh owner of Nettlecombe Court was another Sir Simon, who died in 1440 and left the estate to his nephew Thomas Whalesborough. Sir Simon left money in his will to build a chantry chapel in St Mary's Church, including a perpetual fund for a priest to pray for the souls of the Ralegh family past and present. Work began on the chantry chapel in 1443. (The chantry chapel is now the south aisle.) The first priest was appointed a decade later in 1453. The job description for the priest retained to pray for the souls of the Raleigh family required the following moral virtues; \\"with owt the company of women and suspect persons' and that he not be 'lecherous or perjured, a theaff, a murderer or with any other vices corrupt.\\" Sir Walter Raleigh, who descends from the Ralegh men of Nettlecombe, wrote of visiting Nettlecombe Court to visit his cousins and pay respect to his Ralegh ancestors in Nettlecomb's church. Trevillian-Trevelyan: A family lineage published in Nettlecombe Court shows that the estate passed into the Trevillian family in 1452, when the heiress of the estate, Elizabeth Whalesburgh, upon her marriage, gave Nettlecombe Court as a wedding present to her bridegroom, a knight companion of the king: Sir John Trevilian, Esquire of the Kynge's Body to Henry VI, Gentleman Usher of the King's Chamber. He also served as a Member of Parliament representing Somerset and as High Sheriff of Cornwall. In the 17th century, the spelling of Trevilian became variably spelt as Trevelyan. Oldest British hallmarked church plate: Sir John Trevillian was active in the Tudor courts of King Henry VI and Henry VII and had to be pardoned four times by the two different monarchs. In gratitude for the first three of these royal pardons, Trevillian gave a chalice and patten to Nettlecombe's St Mary's Church. These gifts are the oldest examples of British hallmarked church plate in the United Kingdom, and today are preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/somerset/churches/nettlecombe.htm During Trevillian's lifetime, probably in 1458, the octagonal Tudor font was beautifully carved for the church at Nettlecombe. Around 1500, a later John Trevillian built the west bell tower. At the west end of the nave is a carved wooden screen bearing his arms and the arms of the family of his wife Jane. In 1530 Trevillian renovated and built the present Nettlecombe Court, as it generally appears now, incorporating favorite parts of the earlier medieval manor house. Around the same time, the church porch and north aisle were built, followed by the Trevillian Chapel; with the font carvings plastered around 1548. Nettlecombe set on fire: Nettlecombe Court endured turbulent times during the Reformation and English Civil War. The Trevillian family remained Catholic and loyal to King Charles I, even after the king was beheaded. The family's Royalist stance led to Nettlecombe Court being set on fire in 1645 by the rector of Nettlecombe Court's St Mary's Church. Nettlecombe's rector and parishioners objected to Trevillian's refusal to convert to the Church of England. The rector was joined by his parishioners in setting Nettlecombe ablaze whereby the fire severely damaged the Great Hall of Nettlecombe Court. Nonetheless, Trevillian remained a loyalist, and instead of converting he built a private chapel at Nettlecombe Court with a secret priest's hiding place to provide sanctuary for visiting Catholic priests. http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/somerset/churches/nettlecombe.htm Nettlecombe Court's hidden treasure during the English Civil War: Colonel George Trevelyan then took up arms and fought for the Royalist cause in defense of the king, but eventually was captured and imprisoned by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell's roundheads came to Nettlecombe to seize whatever property they could: crops, horses, farm animals, wagons, tools, weapons, house goods, etc. In an attempt to protect the family fortune; George's wife, Margaret, hid the family silver and other valuables under floorboards at Nettlecombe, but she died before she could reveal the fortune's whereabouts to her husband. The hidden treasure was not rediscovered until the 1790s. When Cromwell's Parliament demanded excessive war reparations of royalist Catholics, Lady Margaret Trevillian (n√©e Strode) bravely journeyed to London. Lady Trevillian petitioned Parliament, asking them to reduce the too-great burden of war reparations Parliament had assessed upon Nettlecombe Court due to the royalist loyalties of the Tevillian family. Parliament refused Lady Trevillian's request. On her journey home, Lady Trevillian died en route, after catching small pox whilst in London, leaving her 9 children motherless. Thus the whereabouts of the family jewels and silver lay hidden for more than a century under floorboards at Nettlecombe until by serendipity a maidservant dropped a half-gold needle through a loose floor plank which had to be pulled up to retrieve it, revealing the long hidden valuables. Baronet: The surviving Trevillian family remained royalists at Nettlecombe; and upon the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, George Trevillian was awarded a second baronet by the king for his loyalty with the spelling of the family name changed to Trevelyan to distinguish from their earlier ancestral baronet name of Trevillian. However, the Church of England later became the fixed faith of the land and Catholicism banned. A later generation of Trevillian-Trevelyans headed off further turmoil at Nettlecombe Court by converting to the Church of England in 1787.http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/somerset/churches/nettlecombe.htm Nettlecombe's St Mary's Church: The story of the Court and its church and families, continued to go hand in hand. The church was restored from 1858 when a clerestory was inserted. In 1935 the 13th-century marble altar stone was discovered buried in the churchyard. It was returned to its place inside the church. Other historical highlights of Nettlecombe include an ancient medieval parish chest and several heraldic medieval tiles. There is a marble wall tablet to one Lady Trevillan, who died in 1697, and a tomb slab in the south aisle to a Sir John Trevelyan (d. 1623). Under the west tower is a grave slab to Richard Musgrave (d 1686). The rood screen dates to the late 15th century, with Victorian restoration, and there are several 16th-century carved bench ends. The beautifully carved pulpit dates to the late 17th century, and there is some very good 17th-century glass including several heraldic panels.  Intellectual salon  In the 19th century, Lady Trevelyan made use of the family estates Wallington and Nettlecombe with its great house and 20,000 acres of land, to host a sophisticated intellectual and artistic salon of the day, renowned for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The sister of Lord Thomas Macaulay, eminent British historian as author of the History of England, Hannah Macaulay, married into the Trevelyan family resulting in another eminent historian George Macaulay Trevelyan, whose ancestors lived at Nettlecombe.  Arms and legend  Trevelyan coat of arms Nettlecombe Court has several emblems and carvings bearing the image of a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found throughout the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, as to whether or not Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester and Strode.  Park  Nettlecombe Park is important for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990. Nettlecombe is known to have had a deer park by 1532. In 1556 it covered and in 1619 . In the 1690s large areas of parkland were enclosed and four new gardens created, including a water garden, which has now disappeared but is remembered in the name 'Canal Field'. The park was extended in the 18th century which included the removal of the houses that made up the village. In 1792 Thomas Veitch laid out the landscape in the style of Capability Brown including the construction of a Ha-ha between the deer park and the meadows. This included the removal of cottages and relocation of the residents. The parkland is now listed, Grade II, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Within the grounds is the Church of St Mary the Virgin which is also a Grade I listed building.  Oak trees  A mature tree at Nettlecombe Park Nettlecombe Park is of undulating parkland boasting monumental solitary trees and treegroups. It was probably once an oak forest in the main. Today, among these, oaks and sweet chestnuts are still the most common. Several sessile oaks are outstandingly large and were famous from ancient accounts for their great size. Nettlecombe oaks once provided tall strong trees for shipbuilding. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, timber hewn from the oaks of Nettlecombe were hand-selected to help build the ships of the English fleet commanded by Sir Walter Raleigh that defeated the Spanish Armada. A number of other English ships that sailed the world to establish British colonies, its navy, and trading empire were built making use of prime Nettlecombe oaks. In the 19th century very good prices were offered to the Trevelyan baronet to cut down and sell the great oaks, but the owner left them standing and the trees have been protected ever since. Some have now grown to a girth of . Today, Nettlecombe acorns are sold to nurseries to begin new sapling oak trees.

Origins The halt was opened in the earliest years of the tramway to serve the then new White City pleasure grounds and the nearby beach at Happy Valley, although not appearing in much of the timetable literature for the first years its popularity was such that it eventually became an official stopping place and remains so today. The area was one of the first on the island to be lit by electricity, using the supply from the electric railway. One of the original lamp standards was moved to a heritage area in Onchan Village known as The Butt in 1987 and restored to original condition. Structures In the earliest years of the railway this station was furnished with a manned booking office, such was the popularity of the location that this was manned for several years, despite its close proximity to the terminus. It was accompanied by the turn of the twentieth century by a covered accommodation for waiting passengers. However, when the resort declined in popularity these facilities were removed in 1978. Environs In line with management changes in the late 1990s, a modern bus shelter was erected here in 1999 serving both the railway and bus services in the area, in keeping with the management policy to provide shelter at as many wayside locations as possible. At this time the station also lost its hand-painted station nameboard in favour of a modern bus stop-type sign; until the summer of 2009 a painted bench remained in situ as a reminder of the old days. To the side of the station is a pedestrian footpath serving the nearby housing estate, and the station is demarcated by a token piece of fencing at its southernmost end. White City White City (After Closure) This area was once a popular destination for holidaymakers and for many years as it served the nearby White City pleasure grounds, which were closed in the early 1980s. Despite the closure of the resort the station has remained open but today largely serves only local traffic. Despite seeing little use, the station still has its own run-round loop which facilitated trams on short workings to return to the depot on the correct running line, as for many years short workings shuttled between Derby Castle Station and here, such was the demand of the amusement park with its wooden roller coaster and traditional attractions such as a ghost train and dodgems. The resort declined in the 1970s and the coaster was replaced with a multi- lane plastic slide when the former became unsafe. Latterly, the area was utilised by a BMX racing club before being given over to redevelopment in the 1990s and it now houses a large block of apartments as well as some detached private dwellings, all served by a loop road which surrounds the estate, installed in 1897 when the original amusement park was developed.

Narmer Catalog (Narmer Macehead) It was found in the ‚Äúmain deposit‚Äù in the temple area of the ancient Egyptian city of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) by James Quibell in 1898. It is dated to the Early Dynastic Period reign of king Narmer (c. 31st century BC) whose serekh is engraved on it. The macehead is now kept at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Motifs The Narmer macehead is better preserved than the Scorpion Macehead and has had various interpretations. One opinion is that, as for the Palette, the events depicted on it record the year it was manufactured and presented to the temple, a custom which is known from other finds at Hierakonpolis. A theory held by earlier scholars, including Petrie and Walter Emery, is that the macehead commemorates great occasions like Narmer's Heb Sed festival or marriage to a possible Queen Neithhotep.Walter B Emery, Archaic Egypt, Pelican Books,1961, naos. The scene depicts a ceremony in which captives and plunder are presented to King Narmer, who is enthroned beneath a canopy on a stepped platform. He wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, holds a flail, and is wrapped in a long cloak. To the left, Narmer's name is written inside a representation of the palace facade (the serekh) surmounted by a falcon. At the bottom is a record of animal and human plunder; 400,000 cattle, 1,422,000 goats, and 120,000 captives. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. On the left side of this macehead is a king sitting under a canopy on a dais; he is wearing the Red Crown (deshret) and is covered in a long cloth or cloak. The king is holding a flail and above the canopy a vulture, possibly the local goddess Nekhbet, hovers with spread wings. Nekhen, or Hierakonpolis, was one of four power centers in Upper Egypt that preceded the consolidation of Upper Egypt at the end of the Naqada III period. Hierakonpolis‚Äôs religious importance continued long after its political role had declined. Directly in front of the king is another dais, or possibly litter, on which a cloaked figure sits facing him. This figure has been interpreted as a princess being presented to the king for marriage, the king's child or a deity. The dais is covered by a bow-like structure and behind it are three registers. In the center register, attendants are walking or running behind the dais. In the top register, an enclosure, with what seems like a cow and a calf, might symbolise the nome of Theb-ka, or the goddess Hathor and her son Horus, deities associated with kingship since earliest times. Behind the enclosure, four standard-bearers approach the throne. In the bottom register, in front of the fan-bearers, are a collection of offerings. The Narmer macehead (right) at time of discovery, Hierakonpolis On the center part of the macehead, behind the throne with the seated king, there is a figure just like the supposed sandal-bearer from the Narmer palette, likewise with the rosette sign above its head. He is followed by a man carrying a long pole. Above him three men are walking, two of them also carrying long poles. The serekh displaying the signs for Narmer can be seen above these men. The top field to the right of the center field shows a building, perhaps a shrine, with a heron perched on its roof. Below this, an enclosure shows three animals, probably antelopes. This has been suggested as signifying the ancient town of Buto, the place where the events described on the macehead might have taken place.

PCM is a non-denominational institution but is considered to be part of the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement and is associated with the Christian Churches/Churches of Christ. PCM Campus History T. Alonzo Street Campus (1992-1995) In 1991, the Philippine Christian Mission Baguio Team began plans for establishing a Bible college in Baguio City. The team had discovered that there were insufficient Filipino leaders for the churches being established in the western cordillera mountains of northern Luzon. The team consisted of Dennis McKinney, Mike Carman, Arnold Pasion, Sol Perillo, Steve Hong, Chris McKinney, and Scott McKinney. The team invited Samson Lubag, a well-known Filipino leader to be the first president of the college. The idea of a new college was promoted during the 1991 National Convention of the Churches of Christ in the Philippines. It was decided that the college would focus its efforts on training pastors for ministry in local churches. This led to the name Philippine College of Ministry (PCM). On June 12, 1992, PCM was opened in a three-story building at 140 T. Alonzo Street, Baguio City. There were 12 students (eight full-time, four part-time). The faculty consisted of Samson Lubag and the five American missionaries on the team. The first floor of the building held the Business Office, the second floor served as the women‚Äôs dormitory, and the third floor held the library and classroom. The furniture and equipment consisted of a piano, three manual typewriters, a large chalkboard, and a ping pong table which served as the only classroom with benches for seating. In 1993, the college moved to Camp 7, Kennon Road, the former Ruff Hause Hotel, about five kilometers from the center of Baguio. This new location offered relatively spacious accommodations for classes, dormitories, and office space, but by 2000 it was clear that the campus was too small for the growing student body. Camp 7 Campus (1995-2005) In 1997, Dennis McKinney and Samson Lubag invited Dr. James Huckaba and his wife, Linda, to join the college. They arrived in September 1998. Dr. Huckaba began serving as academic dean and professor of Greek and Homiletics. Linda has served as the PCM business administrator, registrar, and part-time instructor. On December 21, 1999, PCM founder Dennis McKinney died. Hundreds of people came from all over the Philippines and from America to honor his life and mourn his death. Dennis‚Äô widow, Lorrita McKinney established the Dennis McKinney Memorial Building Fund with the goal of raising enough money to purchase land for a permanent PCM campus. This goal was foremost in Dennis‚Äô heart when he died. In December 2002, PCM purchased 7,500 square meters of land in LamTang, La Trinidad, and donors were sought to fund the construction of a campus. Within two years enough money had been donated to build a basic campus. Groundbreaking took place on September 1, 2004 and construction began in earnest. On June 13, 2005, PCM began the new academic year on the newly finished campus. The new campus has complete facilities for up to 100 students with dormitory space for 64. Lamtang Campus Other significant milestones in the history of Philippine College of Ministry include 1994, enrollment of 24; 1997, enrollment of 28; October 1998, standardization of degree programs; December 1998, first official catalog; January 1999, major expansion of the library; March 1999, Alumni Association established; June 1999, music concentration added; June 1999, computer lab and courses added; November 1999, registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); November 1999, recognition as a college by (CHED); November 1999, Board of Trustees established; December 2000, recognition by the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA); May 2003, resignation of Samson Lubag as president and appointment of Steve Hong as interim president; October 2003, establishment of the college website, http://www.pcm.ph; June 2004, establishment of the Ministry Development Program; November 2004, Rogelio Tenorio becomes president; 2006, enrollment of 48; March 2007, resignation of president Tenorio and appointment of Steve Hong as president; June 2007, enrollment of 58. Degree programs PCM offers the following programs of study: * The Associate of Theology -- a two-year degree program that prepares the student for an associate ministry or for ministry in a rural setting. * The Bachelor of Theology -- a four-year degree program that prepares the student for the ministry on a professional level. The Bachelor of Theology with language requires two years of language, either two years of Hebrew or two years of Greek or one year each of Greek and Hebrew.

Origins Bungalow station seen from Summit station The area was so called because until 1958 there was a large hotel here of that name, and after its destruction it was replaced by a much more modest waiting shelter.Isle of Man Examiner pp1 dated 10 April 1958TT 100 - The Authorised History of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Racing by Mick Duckworth pp29 (2007)(1st Edition) Lily Publications It was not until 2002 that this was in turn knocked down and replaced with a \\"proper\\" station building with station master facilities, booking hall and toilets. Prior to this the staff used a marshall's hut mainly intended for the T.T. races on the island. Museum The Bungalow, despite its remote location, was also the home to Murray's Motorcycle Museum until recent years; this was housed in an ex-Ministry of Defence building and held a large number of static displays. After the death of Joey Dunlop, a statue to his memory was erected in the grounds of the museum and it still remains there despite the closure of the museum. Centenary As part of the International Railway Festival to celebrate the line's centenary in 1995 a third rail was laid from here to the Summit Station to facilitate the use of a steam locomotive on the line. The gauge of the mountain line is 3' 6\\" (to accommodate the \\"fell rail\\") whereas the other main lines on the island are 3' 0\\"; so when Manx Northern Railway locomotive No. 4 Caledonia arrived, the extra rail was laid. This event marked the centenary of the line, and because this locomotive had been loaned to the tramway during construction all those years ago. The remains of the interchange are still visible today. T.T. Races Joey Dunlop Statue The station is a popular viewpoint from which to watch the T.T. motorbike races and the Manx Grand Prix races. As the tramway crosses the course, tramcars terminate on either side of the road during race periods, with cars being moved to the upper part of the line prior to road closure. To facilitate passenger access, there is a footbridge over the road, which was installed as a permanent feature in 1994. Previously there had been a temporary structure that was removed each winter. The railway is extremely busy on race days carrying bikers from Laxey station to this point, and onwards for refreshments at the summit. In recent times boarded walkways have been installed to deliver passengers from the tramcar to the foot of the bridge for ease of access. The bridge itself often carries large advertisement hoardings for local businesses and events.

It was founded by James Clinch around 1811. History=Early history In about 1811, John Clinch, a prominent Witney banker and landowner, and his son James Clinch purchased the Marlborough Head PH at Church Green, Witney. James founded the first Clinch Brewery at the Marlborough Head between 1811 and 1814. His brother John Williams Clinch I was also involved in the enterprise. John Williams Clinch I inherited control of the family bank, J.W. Clinch and Sons, in 1828. (Controlling interest in the bank was sold in 1878 and the bank was later absorbed by Barclays Bank in 1907). After the death of his brother James in 1857, John Williams I assumed control of the brewing aspect of the now extensive Clinch business portfolio (including banking, landowning and farming among other interests). The early death of his eldest son John Williams Clinch II in 1861 led to the brewing and other businesses coming under the day-to-day management of second son William Clinch. The family business seems to have come more firmly under the control of William and his brother James Jr by 1867, after the discovery that an ailing and increasingly senile John Williams I was found to be misappropriating funds from the family banking business. John Williams Clinch I died in 1871 and William and James Jr's control of the brewery and other businesses was formalised as part of an extensive family indenture document in 1874. The indenture resolved several disputes and required William and James to effectively 'buy out' a large number of family members for large cash sums and yearly annuities, plus pay the gambling debts of a younger brother. The indenture marked the partial dismemberment of the business 'empire' which had been built by John Williams Clinch I and his father John. James Jr died in 1877 leaving William with a controlling interest. William's only son died young, so in 1883 William went into partnership with his sons-in-law Thomas William Foreshew and Bellingham Arthur Somerville. Upon William's death in 1891, his brewery business interests passed to both sons in law. William had managed to hold the family business together after 1874 and left a considerable estate, but he was known for eccentricities, such as storing potted venison in the Witney church tower (Bee). However, his death marked the end of 100 years of prominent Clinch family involvement in Witney affairs. John Williams Clinch III missed inheriting the Witney brewing business because it passed to his uncle William Clinch upon the early death of his father in 1861. At the time John Williams III was a Brewers Clerk at the brewery in Witney. In 1863, he rented the Lake Brewery in Douglas, Isle of Man, with this coming into his ownership in about 1868. The Isle of Man Clinch & Co Brewery was prominent in the latter part of the 19th century and enjoyed some success during the early half of the 20th century. However in 1945, the company and brewery were absorbed by Castletown Brewery. 1890-1940 In 1890, the Clinch partnership bought the Blanket Hall Brewery in Witney. In 1892, a further restructure saw the business begin trading as Clinch and Co, with an initial share capital of 4000 ¬£10 shares divided equally between Foreshew and Somerville. Foreshew died in 1927 during a period of financial uncertainty and profit warnings brought about due to agricultural readjustments in the post World War I years. He was succeeded by his son Thomas William Clinch Foreshew. The rise in the importance of bottled beer during the late 1920s and 1930s stabilised business conditions and brought a measure of prosperity. The appointment of L.B. Clark as a brewer in 1937 stimulated sales further and many exhibitions prizes bore testimony to Clark's brewing skills. Against this was set the poor structural condition of tied houses, the repair of which caused considerable financial difficulties for the business between 1937 and 1940. 1940-1990 World War II saw output restrictions and bomb damage to the maltings, but buildings controls averted the crippling cost of buildings repairs in the tied estate. From 1940 profits recovered steadily until an immediate post war boom led to a doubling of profits compared to the 1940 low. Family interest in the brewery was ended with the retirement of Thomas William Clinch Foreshew in 1945. He was followed by a manager who was appointed from a large northern brewery. This manager, later Managing Director, managed the company well through the 1950s, but with the link between the founding family and the company broken, there was less incentive to remain independent. Economies of scale meant that Clinch and Co was vulnerable to a take-over from a larger company and in 1962 and offer from Courage was accepted. Courage‚Äôs were said to be interested in the tied estate and closed the brewery soon after. Clinch and Co went into voluntary liquidation in 1967, though the legal entity \\"Clinch and Co\\" may have survived in Courage's hands until 1977. The Brewery lay more or less dormant until the site was bought by Paddy Glenny in the 1980s who opened \\"Eagle Brewery\\" in the cellar of the original Clinchs Eagle Maltings. In 1990, Eagle was renamed Wychwood Brewery, and was taken over in 2002 by Refresh UK, a subsidiary of Marston's. Wychwood is now a successful brewing business, which is still based around the original Clinchs Eagle Maltings buildings.

History The house was originally a public house: The Royal Oak, part of Fridley or Fredley manor of Mickleham bought in 1762 by Cecil Bishopp, briefly 7th Baronet and occupied by him. He made extensive (tree) plantations on slopes beside where \\"he had purposed to erect a mansion; but relinquishing that design, he enlarged and fitted up an ale-house on the road-side ... the Royal Oak, belonging to the estate, for his own residence; and this dwelling obtained the designation of Juniper-hall, from the abundance of Juniper trees growing in the neighbourhood\\".A topographical history of Surrey, by E.W.

David Jenkinson a wealthy \\"lottery owner\\" bought it and let it from 1780 to Benjamin Elliott when according to historian Brayley (1841) skeletons of two Anglo-Saxons \\"in full war apparel\\" were found while the house was being extended.\\"Parishes: Mickleham\\", A History of the County of Surrey, Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 301‚Äì310. Accessed 22 April 2015. The house was leased by Jenkinson to a group of French emigres from 1792 to 1793 which included Anne Louise Germaine de Sta√´l, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand- P√©rigord, Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara grandson of King Louis XV of France and General Alexandre D'Arblay. D'Arblay met Fanny Burney in the Templeton Room here. He later married her in the village church. In 1800 the house was sold with mixed woodland and garden of about to Thomas Broadwood, the son of John Broadwood and a member of the piano manufacturing family Broadwood and Sons. The last private owners of the house were the MacAndrew family who had major building works carried out from 1882 to 1885, which resulted in the building having its present form. Much of the earlier layout is now hidden, but the main office (formerly the morning room) and the Templeton room are little altered. During World War II the house was occupied by the Canadian army in the buildup to the Normandy landings, and in 1945 it was sold by Miss MacAndrew to the National Trust. The trust owns and manages neighbouring Box Hill (excluding the linear, mainly early Victorian village).

Ghani was a candidate in the 2014 presidential election that was won by his elder brother, Ashraf Ghani.  Early years  Ghani was born on October 29, 1960 in the Logar Province of Afghanistan. An ethnic Pashtun from the Ahmadzai tribe of the Ghilji, Ghani‚Äôs grandfather brought King Zahir Shah‚Äôs father, King Mohammed Nadir Shah, into power in the early 20th century. His father served King Zahir Shah in many ministerial roles, last holding the title of Minister of Transport from the late 1950s until the King was deposed in 1973. Following the overthrow of the King's government, Ghani and his family joined the former King and royalists in exile as part of what came to be known as the Rome Group, which flourished as a political organization though it was not a formal political party.  Grand Council Chieftain of the Kuchis  Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai, chief of the Grand Council of Kuchis, is among the wealthiest and most influential Kuchis, thanks to a large family inheritance based on land ownership as well as a successful transport company. He is also a vice president of an American security and reconstruction company.

History=Establishment Tanjong Katong Primary School was a primary school which began operations on 2 January 2001.A total of ten new primary schools were opened in Singapore in 2001. Four of them were new schools, while the remaining six were formed from the amalgamation of 13 old schools: It was formed with the amalgamation of three schools -- Fowlie Primary School, Haig Boys' School and Mountbatten Primary School -- under the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing schools (PRIME). PRIME is a programme that was initiated by MOE in 1999 to upgrade and rebuild school buildings in Singapore, providing a physical environment conducive to learning. Schools with small enrolment and which are near another would be merged to optimise the use of resources. A new school building was built on Seraya Road for Tanjong Katong Primary School's merger in 2001. The school was officially opened by then-Minister for Community Development Abdullah Tarmugi on 15 July 2004. Foreign students Tanjong Katong Primary School is a popular school with the expatriate community in Singapore. 40% of the school's enrolment are foreigners, with the school's 1,700 pupils coming from 39 countries in 2007. As a result, Tanjong Katong Primary School has the most diverse student population among all government- operated schools in Singapore. First Toa Payoh Secondary School comes in at second place with students from 19 countries. When Tanjong Katong Primary School opened in January 2001, about 100 foreign children registered for places at the school. Today, the school is well-established, resulting in high local demand and limited places for foreign students. As a result of its diverse student population, the school has earned the reputation of being the \\"local international school\\" and a \\"mini United Nations\\". Many of these expatriates preferred to enrol their children into a local government school as school fees are less expensive than those at an international school. While South Korean,There were less than 40 South Korean pupils in Tanjong Katong Primary School in 2003; this number increased to more than 100 in 2006: Chinese and Indonesian pupils outnumber the rest, there are also children from more distant countries such as Yemen, Norway and Israel. The foreign children enrolled have had to adjust to the Singapore school system due to different language abilities. Teachers also faced different parental expectations: Foreign parents usually ask that their children be given a lighter workload while local parents ask for the opposite. Primary One registration in 2007 Due to the popularity of Tanjong Katong Primary School with expatriate parents, parents anxious to get their children into the school started queueing for Phase 3 of the Primary One registrations from 8 p.m. on 27 August 2007. This was despite the registration starting only in the morning of 30 August. Phase 3 registration is meant for foreigners who do not have Singapore permanent residency, though citizens and permanent residents who have yet to secure a place could also apply. Places are usually given out on a first come, first served basis. When Phase 3 registrations started on 30 August, there were still 6,000 available places across all primary schools in Singapore. Principals had advised parents against homing in on certain schools since all schools provide quality education. In spite of this, camping tents were set up at Tanjong Katong Primary School, maids were asked to queue, and parents came prepared with packets of food and blankets. On 29 August, MOE had informed the parents that the school had only one place left, and that place would go to the first person in the queue as balloting would not be carried out unlike in the earlier phases. Despite this, four of the original 11 parents continued to remain in the queue.Unlike Tanjong Katong Primary School, where maids dominated the queue, the queue at Yangzheng Primary School consisted entirely of parents -- mothers during the day and fathers at night: In view of the school's popularity, parents, both locals and foreigners, have already signed up to do volunteer work so that they can enjoy priority in enrolling their children for the 2009 intake. MOE has assured that while parents may not obtain a place at the school of their choice, there are enough places in schools for all eligible Primary One children to receive a quality education. Student Leaders Council The Student Leaders Council is the primary student leadership council in Tanjong Katong Primary. It was established in 2008 of which the Prefectorial Board and Sports Leaders were merged to form Student Leaders Council and has been serving the school ever since. The first batch of Student Leaders Council was led by Sroun Devid as the President of the council. The purpose of the Student Leader Council is to groom students to become leaders through their individual characters and actions. The Student Leaders are identified by wearing the Student Leaders' badge and tie, and a special designed Leaders T-shirt. Student Leaders receive the badge through an investiture, signifying their public office and responsibility to the school. About 30 students are selected to be part of the Student Leader Council each year. They are chosen from a 3-day camp. Their roles include leading the school in cheers when taking part in school-wide events, camps and Sports Day. They also participate in school events like the annual Open Houses and Teachers' Day Celebration. The Student Leaders organise and are involved in almost every event throughout the year. They also have Community Involvement Programmes to local places and overseas schools, i.e. Camp Alpha, Batam, and an Omega challenge in their early Primary 6 to Mount Kinabalu. The Student Leaders take their guidance from the teachers, who direct the student leaders on their conduct and grooming, as well as the activities that they undertake and participate in. Highlights and achievements *Tanjong Katong Primary School offers unusual co-curricular activities such as golf, cricket and bowling . *The school is one of the schools under the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme which is a charity under the auspices of Singapore's National Council of Social Service. RSVP champions volunteerism by senior citizens, who help to mentor latchkey children from the school.Retired doctors, managers and other senior citizens are helping to brighten the future of under-privileged latchkey children in Singapore: *In 2001, 1,326 bottle caps were collected by the school to raise funds for the Society for the Physically Disabled. The school collected the most caps among the nine schools which took part in the charity drive. The metal from the caps were donated to the Prosthesis Foundation in Thailand to make artificial legs. *In 2007, the school was awarded a Bronze for the National Arts Education Award by Singapore's National Arts Council. *In 2008, The Tanjong Katong Primary Netball Team were champions in the East-Zone Netball Championship for both Senior and Junior Team. This is the 2nd year in a row the school has achieved that. *In 2009, the first Student Leaders Council won the Gold Award from the National Youth Council for their Community Involvement Programme to Batam. Notes and referencesFurther reading * Private condominiums such as Spring @ Katong, The Carpmaelina, The Shelford and Glentrees were selling well, despite the oversupply of condominiums in 2005.

Later in December 2007, Tikka in a surprising turn of events filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan against 3 November 2007 actions of General Pervez Musharraf that had come in the form of a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO).

A judgement was given against it thus rendering a quasi-legal validation to the PCO.

It was named the Kettle War because the only shot fired hit a soup kettle. Background After the Dutch Revolt, the northern Netherlands formed their own republic, while the southern Netherlands remained with Spain. Since 1585, the northern Netherlands had closed off the Scheldt, so that the harbours of Antwerp and Ghent could not be reached by trade ships, and this remained so after the revolt. This gave an enormous impulse to the economy of the northern Netherlands (namely Amsterdam), but the southern cities were dislodged from their important trading position. The closure of the Scheldt was confirmed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, to which the Spanish agreed. After the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish Netherlands had been ceded to Austria by the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714. Since Europe's \\"Diplomatic Revolution\\" of 1756, Austria, and thus the Austrian Netherlands, had been in an alliance with France. Prussia, France's former ally, entered into an alliance with Britain. The change, sensational at the time, made nonsense of all the strategic assumptions and plans, current since 1713, based on the premises that the southern Netherlands would serve as a barrier between the Republic and France and that the Republic's security depended on close ties with Austria and Britain. It was a shift which undoubtedly made it ever more attractive for the Dutch to remain neutral in any conflicts between both Britain and France, and Austria and Prussia. Course In 1781 Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, taking advantage of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, demanded the final dismantling of the Barrier system, and in 1784, he demanded the return of territory in the Overmaas and States Flanders (roughly current-day Zeelandic Flanders), as well as Dutch evacuation of Maastricht and the reopening of the Scheldt. This happened shortly after the Treaty of Paris. Although the Habsburg army in that region was not equipped very well, with a lack of artillery and supply, the emperor decided to threaten war with the Dutch.Allmayer-Beck, J. C. (1980) Das Heerwesen under Joseph II., p. 43. In: ≈åsterreich zur Zeit Kaiser Josephs II. Mitregent Kaiserin Maria Theresias, Kaiser und Landesf≈´rst. Nieder≈çsterreicheische Landesausstellung. Stift Melk. Convinced that the Netherlands would not dare react, Joseph II had three ships (including the merchant ship Le Louis with the emperor's flag) sail from Antwerp for the Scheldt. On 9 October 1784, as a letter to Benjamin Franklin asserts, the war seemed inevitable. That day the Dutch ship the Dolfijn was sent out to intercept the Imperial ships. After only one shot, which hit a kettle, Le Louis surrendered.Habermehl, N. (2000) Joan Cornelis van der Hoop (1742‚Äì1825) Marinebestuurder voor stadhouder Willem V en koning Willem I, p. 91. On 30 October the emperor declared war. On 18 November, the States of Holland reacted: the Count of Salm was asked to form a small army. The Patriots used the incident for political propaganda and organized the Exercitiegenootschappen militia all over the country. The Admiralty of Friesland offered two new warships, but they were unable to leave the port of Harlingen and were dismantled.Habermehl, N. (2000) Joan Cornelis van der Hoop (1742‚Äì1825) Marinebestuurder voor stadhouder Willem V en koning Willem I, p. 92. According to the Annual Register for the years 1784‚Äì85, Dolfijn would have needed a full broadside of seven guns to stop Le Louis. Austrian forces invaded Dutch territory, razed a custom station and strongly occupied the old Fort Lillo, at the time used as a vegetable garden. The garrison of Lillo broke the dikes, inundating a large area and drowning many people. On 13 February 1785, the Dutch ambassador Van Berckel wrote an extended letter to John Jay, in which he explained the situation. Results As a consequence of this short skirmish, and under the mediation of France, negotiations were reopened between the countries. This led in 1785 to the Treaty of Fontainebleau. It was decided that the Scheldt would remain closed to shipping, but that the southern Netherlands would be compensated for this by the Republic. At a rough estimate the Republic paid 2 million guilder (according to other sources 10 million guilder).Gutka, K. (1980) Die Aussenpolitiek ≈åsterreich zwischen 1740 und 1790, p. 74.

Much later on, definitive agreements were made between Belgium and the Netherlands about accessing the Scheldt. The war contributed to the decline and fall of Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, advisor to the Dutch stadtholder, who was accused of favouring the enemy due to his familial ties to Joseph.

His importance rests on his Historia persecutionis Africanae Provinciae, temporibus Genserici et Hunirici regum Wandalorum (A History of the African Province Persecution, in the Times of Genseric and Huneric, the Kings of the Vandals). Divided into three books, the work is a predominantly contemporary narrative of the cruelties practiced against the orthodox Nicene Christians of Northern Africa by the Arian Vandals. The first book provides an account of the reign of Genseric, from the Vandal invasion of Africa in 429 until the king's death in 477; whilst, the second and third record events of Huneric's reign (477-484) - of which Victor was an eyewitness. Andy Merrills and Richard Miles have argued that with the work Victor 'created a coherent narrative of a Vandal persecution where previously there had been none'. Little is known of the author or his circumstances and so historians have put forward deductions based on the internal evidence of his work. It has been argued by John Moorhead that Victor wrote the Historia persecutionis whilst he was a priest in Carthage and that he 'had access to the archives of the see of Carthage'. The 'text originated in the Church of Carthage' and was published circa 488; however, scholars contend that Victor wrote much of his work in 484 but subsequently added perspectives from after Huneric's death. Danuta Shanzer has argued that the use of medical terminology in Victor's descriptions of torture indicate that he may have had a medical background. It is contested in academic discourse whether or not Victor was actually the bishop of Vita or simply born there. Victor throws much light on social and religious conditions in Carthage and on the African liturgy of the period, portraying 'the Vandals as being implacably and violently opposed to the true Catholic Faith'. His history contains many documents not otherwise accessible, e.g. the Confession of Faith drawn up for the orthodox bishops by Eugenius of Carthage and presented to Huneric at the conference in 484 of Catholic and Arian bishops. Two documents: a Passio beatissimorum martyrum qui apud Carthaginem passi sunt sub impio rege Hunerico (die VI. Non. Julias 484) and a Notitia Provinciarum et Civitatum Africae (List of the Provinces and Cities of Africa), formerly appended to all the manuscripts and now incorporated in the printed editions, are probably not Victor's. The former may be the work of one of his contemporaries. The latter is a list of the Catholic bishops who were summoned to the 484 conference and their Episcopal sees in the Latin provinces of North Africa, arranged according to provinces in this order: Africa Proconsularis, Numidia, Byzacena, Mauretania Caesariensis, Mauretania Sitifensis, Tripolitana, Sardinia.

History John Williams Clinch III, son of John Williams Clinch II, missed inheriting the Clinch & Co Brewery, the Witney, Oxfordshire based brewing business, because it passed to his uncle William Clinch upon the early death of his father in 1861. At the time John Williams III was a Brewers Clerk at the brewery in Witney. thumb In 1863, he rented the Lake Brewery, which was founded in 1779 by George Booth, in Douglas, Isle of Man. It came into his ownership in about 1868. The brewery had a motto in Manx Gaelic, \\"Glen as Lajer\\" or \\"Clean and Strong\\" with a further motto \\"Troor Duirn\\" or \\"Three Fists\\". Clinch and Co, Lake Brewery appears to have had a turbulent business history, with John Williams III struggling to retain direct family control of the brewery until the banks forced its flotation in the 1890s. He remained Managing Director until his death in 1905. He was prominent in Manx affairs. In addition to being the owner and Managing Director of the brewing company, he was a member of Douglas town council as well as President of the Manx Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and later stood unsuccessfully as an MHK for Douglas in the House of Keys. The brewery survived John Williams Clinch's death in 1905 and enjoyed some success during the early half of the 20th century. However, in 1945, the company and brewery were absorbed by Castletown Brewery. Clinch and Co failed to survive post war, partly because it failed to capitalise on evolving business conditions as World War II drew to a close. The original brewery building in North Quay, Douglas survives and is currently unoccupied.

White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910‚Äì1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, UK: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume II, p. 265.) was an English peeress. She was created 1st Countess of Guildford for life at the Restoration on 14 July 1660, which became extinct upon her death c. 3 September 1667. She held the office of Groom of the Stole and Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Dowager, Henrietta Maria. Family She was born Elizabeth Feilding, the daughter of Sir William Feilding (later created 1st Earl of Denbigh) and his wife Susan Villiers, herself sister to the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. William Feilding benefited greatly from his brother-in-law's rise in court, receiving various offices and dignities. He married circa 1607 and was invested as a knight around the same time, in March 1606/7. He was then created 1st Baron Feilding of Newnham Paddox in 1620, and 1st Earl of Denbigh and 1st Viscount Feilding on 14 September 1622. Elizabeth Feilding had two sisters and two brothers which survived infancy. Her brother Basil, born ca. 1608, became the 2nd Earl of Denbigh upon their father's death. Her sister Margaret, also known as Mary, born ca. 1613, married James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, and was the mother of Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. Her brother George, born ca. 1614, became the 1st Earl of Desmond. In the early 1620s, her maternal grandmother Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham, converted to Roman Catholicism, which probably influenced other members of the family including her mother, Susan, who converted to Catholicism after the death of her husband. Elizabeth and her sister Mary were known to be devout Catholics. On 21 January, either 1639 or 1640, Lady Elizabeth appeared as a masque in Salmacida Spolia. Marriage On 26 December 1639, Elizabeth was married at Chapel Royal, Whitehall to an Anglo-Irish peer, Lewis \\"the Valiant\\" Boyle, 1st Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky, the second son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. As a result of her marriage, she was styled as \\"Viscountess Boyle of Kinalmeaky\\". Francis, Lord Willoughby, reported a story about her wedding day to the Earl of Rutland. Boyle, according to Willoughby, had certain diseases and also a war injury that would have prevented him consummating the marriage. Ahead of the wedding he told his sister Lettice, Lady Goring, about this problem and they planned the excuse that she would tell everyone he had fallen down the stairs. However, Lettice told his secret to her husband George Goring, who told Henrietta Maria. The queen advised Feilding not to go to bed with her husband on her wedding night. Boyle soon realised that everyone at court knew about his health problems, and either fled to France or went into hiding in London.The manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland preserved at Belvoir castle, vol. 1 (London, 1905), p. 519. Her sisters-in-law included Lady Alice Boyle and Lady Sarah Boyle, and her brothers-in-law included Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington; Robert Boyle; and Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. The marriage was brief, lasting less than three years; she was soon left a widow by her husband's death in 1642. Lord Kinalmeaky was killed at the battle of Liscarroll, at the start of the Irish Confederate Wars. She never remarried. Later life During the following \\"dark days of the Irish Rebellion,\\" Elizabeth stayed with her father-in-law, Lord Cork, who refers to her often, with special fondness, in his letters. Eventually he sent her away to England, for safety's sake. \\"God knows,\\" he writes, \\"with what grief of soul I part with her.\\"Townshend, 391 Her father fought in the English Civil War, as a Royalist. Lady Kinalmeaky became a Roman Catholic and shared for some years Queen Henrietta Maria's exile in France along with her mother, the Countess of Denbigh, who also attended the Queen.Palgrave, 51 While in France she had charge of Margaret Blagge, daughter of Colonel Thomas Blagge and eventually wife of Sidney Godolphin and mother of Francis Godolphin. John Evelyn, author of the book The Life of Mrs Godolphin, depicts Lady Guilford as a harsh, overly religious governess. After the Restoration, she was made Countess of Guildford for life by Charles II on 14 July 1660. She also held the office of Groom of the Stole and Lady of the Bedchamber to Henrietta Maria, then the Queen-Mother. She died without issue c. 3 September 1667 at Colombes, France. Her will (dated 2 September 1667) was probated on 20 November 1667. Upon her death, the earldom of Guildford became extinct.

Gate of Thunder review, Retro Game Age. GameSpot gave the Virtual Console release a 7/10, saying that the game is overly short and lacking in innovation (particularly noting the lack of any way of dealing with enemies other than shooting them), but that the memorable level and boss design, well-conceived weapons system, and consistently outstanding soundtrack make it a worthwhile purchase. IGN gave it an 8.5, concurring with the GameSpot review on most points, but arguing that Gate of Thunder makes a number of innovations to the shooter genre. Classic-games.net gave Gate of Thunder a 9/10, saying it remains one of the best reasons to pick up a Duo Gate of Thunder was awarded Best Music for a CD Game of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly editors ranked Gate of Thunder the 53rd-best console video game of all time, explaining that it stood apart from other shooters due to its CD-quality heavy metal soundtrack and animated backgrounds which \\"are as much an enemy in this game as the swarms of enemy bogies or the dozens of bosses and minibosses.\\" They added that they chose Gate of Thunder over the sequel, Lords of Thunder, because it is lengthier.

In the context of the elder Walramian line, this order is the highest Luxembourgian national order and is bestowed by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. It may be awarded to sovereigns, princes of sovereign houses and heads of state for meritorious service to Luxembourg and the Grand Duke. In the context of the younger Ottonian line, this order is a house order (dynastic order) of the Dutch Royal House of Orange-Nassau and is awarded as a personal gift by the King of the Netherlands. In this case, the honour is conferred on a person who has rendered special service to the Royal House.Orders for services to the Royal House - description at the website of the Dutch Royal House (Dutch language) History=1858-1892 The order was founded by royal grand- ducal decree on 31 March 1858 by King-Grand Duke William III. The sovereignty of the order was to be shared between both branches of the House of Nassau, under an agreement between William III, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Adolphe, Duke of Nassau and future Grand Duke of Luxembourg. The order originally included only one grade (i.e. Knight), but was increased to four by William III in 1873: # Grand Cross # Grand Officer # Officer # Knight The further rank of Commander (in between Grand Officer and Officer) was introduced in 1882. 1892-present None of the changes made by William III were confirmed by Adolphe, with whom the order was supposed to be shared, and Adolphe refused to award any of the new grades. When William III died without a male heir, the grand duchy of Luxembourg passed to Adolphe, as dictated by the Nassau Family Pact. Two years later, he abolished the grades that William III had created unilaterally and, to this day, the order has maintained just one grade, that of Knight. In 1905, Adolphe agreed with Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to once again share sovereignty of the order between both ruling branches of the House of Nassau. At the present time, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg are joint Grand Masters of the Order of the Gold Lion of Nassau. The order is conferred only on rare occasions in the Netherlands or Luxembourg. For example, the former Dutch Foreign Secretaries Max van der Stoel and Pieter Kooijmans were made knights of this order by the Queen of the Netherlands. In 1999, the two Grand Masters made the South African President Nelson Mandela a knight during his state visit to the Netherlands (see Nelson Mandela awards). Insignia A knight wears the order's badge on a sash on the right shoulder, and the plaque (breast star) of the order on the left chest. *The badge of the order is a white-enamelled golden Maltese Cross, with the golden monogram \\"N\\" between the arms of the cross. The obverse central disc is in blue enamel, bearing the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau. The reverse central disc is also blue enamelled, with the motto Je maintiendrai (\\"I will maintain\\") in gold. *The plaque is an 8-pointed star with straight silver rays; the same obverse of the badge of the order appears at its centre, surrounded by the motto Je maintiendrai in gold letters on white enamel. *The ribbon of the sash of the order is yellow-orange moir√© with a small blue stripe at each edge.  Award criteria  Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg and The Grand Duke both wearing the insignia of the order. They are accompanied by Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg. \\"Honorary distinctions of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\\": The Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau can be conferred on sovereigns and on princes of sovereign houses and, nowadays, also on heads of state, for meritorious service to the Grand Duke and country. The bestowal of the insignia is carried out by the Grand Duke or his specially appointed official representative. The brevet is awarded in agreement with the head of the Ottonian branch of the House of Nassau (The Netherlands).  Princes and Princesses of the House of Nassau  Princes who are sons or brothers of the heads of the two lines of the House of Nassau are born knights of the order. In 1984, Queen Beatrix and Grand Duke Jean made an agreement that princesses (daughters of the heads of the two lines of the House of Nassau) may be admitted when they reach the age of majority (18). On 16 February 2009, Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg received the order on her 18th birthday. Now that King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is the head of the Dutch branch, his daughters Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, Princess Alexia of the Netherlands and Princess Ariane of the Netherlands are also entitled to receive the order on their 18th birthday.

Scrapped in the late 1920s. *Polar Bear (Replica) replica of the 1921 battery locomotives. Built by Alan Keef in 2003 on original chassis, in service. Rolling stock=Four wheeled coaches All of the railway's coaches were supplied by G.F. Milnes & Co. of Birkenhead and were of similar design. They resemble a smaller version of the trailers used on the Manx Electric Railway and were originally either varnished or painted a dark colour (contemporary postcards make it difficult to tell which) but the restored versions are varnished and carry no lining out, which is evident from early views. The four GGR carriages at Amberley Museum carry a brown and cream livery. * \\"A\\" Coaches, the three original four-wheeled \\"toastrack\\" coaches supplied with \\"Sea Lion\\" in 1896 were never originally numbered but are known as the \\"A\\" coaches: they feature stone guards at rail level and a more plain valence design when compared to other coaches. * \\"B\\" Coach was ordered owing to popularity of the line in the early years. This coach was slightly different from the others, having higher windows, different style valences, and is always known by its letter owing to these small differences: it remains to be re-built but several parts are in store. * \\"C\\" Coaches & \\"D\\" Coaches, un-numbered originally made up the final four coaches (2x \\"C\\" and 2x \\"D\\") and arrived with Polar Bear in 1905; referred to as \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" type, the only major difference being the small style change of the valancing. There are two restored coaches with \\"Polar Bear\\" at Amberley Museum and two further replicas (one of which serves as a disabled car), and four rebuilt coaches at Groudle itself, built by the company. A further original rebuilt coach is at the West Lancashire Railway, but made a return to Groudle in 1996. Bogie coaches The first two coach bodies are built on the frames of coaches originally purchased from Doddington in 1982, the original bodies being unfit for future use and considerably different from the more traditional version now applied. The coaches all feature a valance along their lengths using the same pattern as the original 1905 type coaches to give them a more authentic appearance. The coaches are numbered one to three but their fleet numbers aren't immediately apparent as they are only painted on one end on the underframe. *No. 1, built (1986), roof added in 1988. *No. 2, built (1987) by the railway with roof,. *No. 3, built (1994) to be all-weather car but project remained incomplete. The third coach, used at peak times, is slightly different from the original two, owing to the proposed all-weather appearance which hasn't been executed. All the coaches are painted in a maroon livery, the original two carrying G.G.R. lettering until repaint in 2001 when this was lost; however in 2007 all three coaches were fitted with the new railway crest; interiors are black painted bench seating with black (changed from grey in early 2008) floors, featuring a hand-brake at one end of the vehicle. All three coaches are due to be replaced in 2014 by new build coaches of similar design funded by the Manx Lottery Trust. The underframe of bogie coach 3 will be retained as a works flat.  Fauld wagons  In 1982, the railway purchased a set of \\"bomb\\" wagons which had previously been used at RAF Fauld. They provided limited passenger accommodation before the arrival of the bogie coaches and since then time have been used on works trains. They fell out of use and their condition deteriorated. They were all scrapped by 2011. * No. 1, drop-side ballast wagon, scrapped in 2011. * No. 2, tool van, with drop-sides removed, scrapped in 2011. * No. 3, storage van, later stripped to flat, scrapped in 2011. * No. 4, used as coal wagon for storage only, scrapped in 2011. * No. 5, never used in service, used as coal store without brakes, scrapped in 2011. * No. 6, bought but never arrived on railway, used for spare parts and scrapped in 1984 The wheelsets and many of the brake components from the Fauld wagons were retained by the railway for future use. In 2012 two wheelsets were incorporated into the flat wagon nicknamed \\"FAT 1\\".

Viewing Motion Diagrams One of the major usages of motion diagrams is to present film through a series of frames taken by a camera. Viewing an object on a motion diagram allows one to determine if an object is at a constant rest, speeding up, or slowing down. As the frames are taken, it can be assumed that an object is at a constant rest if it occupies the same position over time. It can be assumed that an object is speeding up if there is a visible increase in the space between objects as time passes.Knight, R. (2008).

With exception of Class E 19 it was Deutsche Reichsbahn's fastest electric locomotive. After 1945 most of the surviving locomotives were operated by Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), although a few passed to Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) and √ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen (√ñBB). In addition to the 55 locomotives built in Germany, a further 8 locomotives of a modified design were built in Austria in 1939 as Class E 18.2 (later √ñBB class 1018).  Development  dates back to the year 1881, when near Berlin the first public line was taken into service in Berlin.German WP article on electric traction Despite successful test runs with three-phase current electric railcars up to a top speed of in 1903, the German state railways decided to use single-phase alternating current because the overhead line of three-phase current was very complicated. The first mainline electric locomotives were all equipped with large, slow-going single electric motors. Obviously the large single engines and the resulting power transmission by connecting rods made for poor operation characteristics at high speed. Nevertheless, it was not before 1913 that first electric main line locomotives with nose-suspended, fast-going single motors were commissioned. This development was further delayed by World War I. The decisive breakthrough was finally made in the 1920s, as large numbers of electric trainsets were developed for the electrification of the Berlin Stadtbahn in 1928. Accordingly, also in 1928 the first electric main line express locomotive entered service. Class E 17 was a huge success, with a total of 38 units produced. The smaller was derived for lighter service in the less mountainous middle German regions. However, during the mid-1930s DRG decided to speed up its express train services over the that Class E 17 was admitted for. The newly developed Class E 18's basic layout was accordingly based on Class E 17. The electric design was based on the newer Class E 04. With respect to the higher speeds new class E 18's shape was streamlined. The Class E 18 was capable of operating a train at on level track, and up to at on a 2% gradient. Another innovation was that the Class E 18 was the first electric locomotive with an engineer's seat. Earlier models were operated standing.  Service = Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft  In 1935 two prototypes were taken into service and tested by DRG. As no major changes were necessary, serial production began shortly afterwards. From the start these powerful locomotives took over most of the express services on electrified lines. Originally intended for service on the Berlin - Munich main line, due to a different layout of the overhead lines in middle Germany (World War II prevented the planned modification). Most locomotives were used in southern Germany. Some also served in Silesia. During the development of the following Class E 19, DRG undertook several trial runs with Class E 18 in 1935 and 1936 on which a top speed of was achieved. With regards to the power, top speed and elegant design in 1939 during the Universal Exposition in Paris a Gold Medal was awarded to Class E 18. Eight locomotives based on the E 18 series were ordered by Bundesbahn √ñsterreich (BB√ñ) in 1937 for the electrification of the Salzburg to Linz line. These were built in Austria (by Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf) to a modified specification. To cope with the steeper gradients in Austria's mountainous geography these units were equipped with stronger motors (developed for class E 19) and their top speed was reduced to by a different gear transmission ratio, resulting in a significantly higher tractive effort. By 1939 when the units were delivered, Austria was occupied by Germany and the locomotives were delivered to DRG as Class E 18.2 (numbers E 18 201-208). With 61 units so far delivered, DRG ordered an additional series of another 48 units, but these were not delivered due to the war . During the war seven units were lost to air attacks and two to accidents. The seven units deployed in Silesia were in 1945 transferred to Bavaria in order not to leave them to the advancing Red Army.  Deutsche Bundesbahn  After the war 34 units passed to the Deutsche Bundesbahn in West Germany, to which were added a further 5 locomotives purchased from East Germany in 1952 and 2 newly built Class E 18s commissioned in 1955. In 1968 Class E 18 was renumbered to DB Class 118. Even though the first production-series Class E 10 locomotives (top speed ) entered service in 1956, it was not until the after the deployment of the new Class 103 TEE production-series locomotives in 1970 that Class 118 was withdrawn from main line express services. They were then used for regional services and charter trains until being retired between 1976 and 1984. DB 118 and √ñBB 1118 in W√ºrzburg, 1984  Deutsche Reichsbahn  Those Class E 18s which were left in Eastern Germany had a rather adventurous history after the war. The five units which were in usable condition were seized by the Soviet Union in 1946 as war reparations. When they were returned in 1952 (in a poor condition), Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) sold them to West Germany's Deutsche Bundesbahn. This was partly due to the fact that much of East Germany's railway system and most of its electrification equipment had also been transferred to the Soviet Union in the early years of Soviet occupation, thus leaving little work for electric locomotives. However, during the second half of the 1950s DR began to restore electrification to its lines and therefore needed fast electric locomotives. Six damaged E 18 locomotives had been stored at the AEG factory in Hennigsdorf since the war, from which three usable units were re-assembled in 1958-60. They were converted to a top speed of in 1969. One of these locomotives was wrecked in 1969, but the other two were renumbered as DR Class 218 in 1970. The two surviving Class 218 were in service until German reunification, but were taken out of regular service shortly thereafter.  √ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen  After the war, the newly reformed Austrian Federal Railways (now named √ñsterreichische Bundesbahnen (√ñBB)) renumbered the seven remaining usable Class E 18.2 to √ñBB Class 1018 (1018.01-05, 07 and 08). In addition to these, one working locomotive (1018.101) was assembled from the parts of war-damaged E 18 046 and E 18 206. The √ñBB also inherited the German E 18 42, which became the solitary √ñBB Class 1118 (1118.01). These two mavericks retained German gear transmission ratios, and were √ñBB's fastest locomotives until Class 1042.5 was commissioned in the late 1960s. The √ñBB locomotives received some modernisations (e. g. new cabfront windows, with two windows instead of the original three), and the last examples remained in service until the early 1990s.  Preserved  Of the 55 Class E 18 locomotives built, six have been preserved. No. E 18 03 is in the DB Museum Koblenz. E 18 08 is owned by the Garmisch Stiftung Bahn-Sozialwerk and is stored at Augsburg Railway Park. E 18 19 is privately owned and is kept in the former Bahnbetriebswerk at Glachau. The town of Gem√ºnden am Main is seeking to turn E 18 24 into a worthy monument with its long tradition as a railway hub, but at present it is being restored in Weimar by the TEV Th√ºringer Eisenbahn.

Between 1930 and 1959, he served as bishop of the Diocese of Ljubljana. He may be best-remembered for his controversial role during World War II. Ro≈æman was an ardent anti-communist and opposed the Liberation Front of the Slovene People and the Partisan forces because they were led by the Communist party. He established relations with both the fascist and Nazi occupying powers, issued proclamations of support for the occupying authorities, and supported armed collaborationist forces organized by the fascist and Nazi occupiers. The Yugoslav Communist government convicted him in absentia in August 1946 of treason for collaborating with the Nazis against the Yugoslav resistance. In 2009, his conviction was annulled on procedural grounds. During the Communist period, official historiography portrayed Ro≈æman as a Nazi collaborator. Western historians, including Jozo Tomasevich and Gregor Kranjc have also, more recently, described Ro≈æman as a collaborator, based on his proclamations and actions during the war. The Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia has been actively campaigning for his rehabilitation, claiming his actions were motivated solely to minimize the number of Slovenian casualties during the war. Pre-war years=Early life Ro≈æman was born on 9 March 1883 into a Carinthian Slovene family in Dolintschitschach ()Kattnig, Franc & Janzo Zerzer. 1982. Dvojeziƒçna Koro≈°ka/Zweisprachiges K√§rnten. Klagenfurt: Morhorjeva zalo≈æba/Hermagoras-Verlag. near Feistritz ob Bleiburg () in Austria-Hungary to Franc Ro≈æman and Terezija (n√©e Glinik) Ro≈æman. The family lived on a medium-sized farm, had seven children (Gregorij was the youngest) and was severely indebted. In 1889 he started attending public school in ≈†mihel and then enrolled in a gymnasium in Klagenfurt. During his years in gymnasium he lived in the Marijini≈°ƒçe dormitory, which hosted students that were expected to study theology after graduating. He published essays in the newsletter of Carinthian Slovenes Mir and also (under the pseudonym \\"Emil Faniƒç\\") in the handwritten student journal Vaje, for which he edited six issues from 7th grade until graduation. After graduating with honors in 1904 he studied theology in Klagenfurt. He joined the Academy of Slovene seminaries () becoming its president of it in his final year and published essays in its journal Bratoljub (which he edited in school year 1906/07). At that time, Slovene students were in constant conflict with German students, who published their own journal, Germania. The conflict was over nationalistic frictions in Carinthia. He was a member of the Congregation of Mary (). In his last school year he visited Rome with the Rev Anton Benetko, where he met Pope Pius X. Parish priest, prefect and docent On 21 July 1907, he was ordained in his home parish of St Michael () by Bishop Jo≈æef Khan. In 1908, he was sent as a chaplain to Ferlach. At that time Ferlach was politically controlled by German liberals. The workers were tending towards social democracy. He set to renew the spiritual life in his parish and was active in propagating Christian-social ideas and organising the workers. He stayed in Ferlach () for one year. On 1 October 1909 he went to Vienna to continue his study of theology. On 27 June 1912 he obtained a PhD () in theology from Catholic Theology Faculty of University of Vienna. After returning he was appointed as a prefect in boys' seminary Marianum in Klagenfurt in 1912 and as a docent of moral theology in 1913. In the school year 1914/15 he was appointed as a docent of Canon law and relieved of prefect service. In 1914 he taught moral theology to 4th grade at Klagenfurt and moral theology and canon law to the first three grades at Ple≈°ivec. He participated in Eucharistic Congress in Vienna in 1912 and as a result wrote a prayer book titled \\"Presveta Evharistija\\" (published in 1915 by Dru≈æba Sv. Mohorja). After the publication of a new Code of church law in 1917 he was appointed to a committee for its realization in Klagenfurt Diocese. He participated in the Slovene Christian-social () association as a lecturer. The Treaty of St. Germain divided the plebiscite area in Carinthia into zone A and B. Zone A was under Yugoslav administration and lost control of Klagenfurt. Carinthian bishop Adam Hefter established a special vicariate in Ebendorf () in July 1919 and appointed Ro≈æman as a judicial consultant of general vicar provost Matija Raindl. Because of his engagement with Carinthian Slovenes and his open support for Yugoslavia in the Carinthian Plebiscite it was quite clear that in case a majority in zone A decided against Yugoslavia in the plebiscite he would not be able to stay in Carinthia. Canon law professor in Ljubljana Soon after the integration of the Slovenes in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, on 23 July 1919 Regent Alexander signed a law creating the University of Ljubljana and in December lectures commenced. Janez Zore, a church historian from the Theology faculty, proposed that Ro≈æman be invited as a professor of church law. Ro≈æman accepted, with permission from Bishop Hefter. Ro≈æman began lecturing on 7 January 1920. He lived in Ljubljana with professor Alfonz Leviƒçnik and took a position of prefect in the student's seminary Marijini≈°ƒçe in the school year 1920‚Äì21. After less than five months of teaching, on 31 May, he was nominated by his colleagues for a docent position and promoted by the ministry on 27 August. He was listed as an associate professor in the school year 1924‚Äì25. He published many essays, both professional and pastoral, mostly in Bogoslovni Vestnik (). As in his lectures, his essays explained the practical pastoral implications of a law for a common priest. He included current events in his essays. He wrote an important essay titled Church and politics () (publication date unknown) which would become very relevant in the Second World War. In it he said that the Church \\"has the task to protect the truths of Christianity, that is moral and religious truths, to protect, teach and accustom the nations for them to organize all their lives and acts according to these truths\\". In his opinion many areas are not related to the Church, giving it no right to take sides or even decide on such issues. Instead, he claimed that the Church should limit itself to religious, moral or ecclesiastical issues. He also stated his opinion about coup d'√©tat (or revolution) and any official government authority: he said that \\"the church is indifferent on different forms of authority, it considers none of them to be the only right one; it rejects none, as long as it is capable of reaching the purpose of the state\\". This purpose was to \\"protect justice for everybody and to care for public prosperity\\". The Church \\"condemns as immoral and violent change of government, every revolution\\". However, if the violent takeover has occurred \\"the Church teaches that the highest duty of every government is to take care of public prosperity. At the time of revolution, the highest duty of the government and the citizens is to end chaos as soon as possible and to build on the ruins of the old a new state, which will function as a device of public prosperity. If the revolutionary government is strong and able enough to positively organize the state to reach its goal, than this highest duty requires of every citizen to recognize the new government.\\". In these essays he stated that in time of war, the Church's duty is to \\"reduce the horror of the war\\" and care for war prisoners. Another important essay was Church and the state (), which was used for a lecture at the fifth Catholic rally in Ljubljana on 28 August 1923. In it he explained his relation to government, writing, \\"the source of every authority, even political, is God. Every authority is given for the welfare of the humanity\\". He added that state sovereignty cannot be absolute, as it is dependent on God, which limits that authority, the limits \\"which it should not cross, if it does not want to abuse its power against the will of God, in which name it wields the sword (Romans 13,4)\\". He says that the common concern of both, the church and the state, is marriage, children and education. Disagreement between them in these areas causes great damage to the citizens and to the state itself. He criticized the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Vidovdan Constitution, which set limits on church autonomy, saying that the \\"annunciation of the religious truth is one of the main tasks of the Catholic Church and its inner affair\\", so \\"we must, on the basis of our catholic principles, reject every attempt to institute a police control over the church in its own matters\\" Involvement in the Orel Orel was a Slovenian Roman Catholic youth gymnastic and sport movement that was organized in the early 20th century as an alternative to a liberal gymnastic movement Sokol. The decision to create it was taken at a gathering of Slovene Christian-social association in Maribor, between 3 and 4 September 1905. The first club was established in Jesenice, in February 1906. Then on 10 April 1908, the Association of Gymnastic Sections () was created. On 19 March 1909 at a local assembly of AGS in Bohinjska Bistrica, the organisation was officially named Orel. Ro≈æman learned of the organisation in Carinthia, as by 1913, its section had five sub-sections. In 1920, in Ljubljana, he was elected by the Orel president board as secondary vice-president. As a priest, he quickly became its spiritual leader. As the organisation in Orel began to evolve, he took leadership of debate club, high-school students and other elements. After it was rebuilt in the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Orel greatly expanded its membership, but neglected its spiritual and religious side. In 1921 Ro≈æman wrote an article in the Theological Journal, Contributions for pastoral profession () in which he expressed his ideas about pastoral activity of youth organisations (like Orel). He first asked whether the organisation should attend equally to everyone or focus on the elite athletes. He proposed a compromise, saying that the Catholic Church is required to pastorally attend anyone that counts himself as its member, but that its missionary activity could be advanced by success in sports, especially among the youth. He emphasized the need for youth to be part of Christian organisations, because if the youngsters were left alone, they could easily fall under the influence of materialism and so become communists or social democrats. He highlighted the importance of spiritual growth, advising Orel members to join Mary's congregation (as they were more focused on spiritual life than Orel). In addition, he emphasized the importance for Orel of family values, national consciousness and other Christian values. He left Orel in 1929, when he became suffragan bishop. The Yugoslav government banned Orel, leaving only the state-controlled Sokol shortly afterwards. Bishop of Ljubljana He was appointed as co-adjutor bishop of Ljublana on 17 March 1929 and consecrated titular Bishop of Semta on 14 July 1929. He succeeded as Bishop of Ljublana on 17 May 1930. As a bishop, he set out to spiritually renew his diocese, starting with his priests, who he felt should not be involved in politics. After leaving Orel, he focused on the Marian societies (), but mainly on Catholic Action, in which he saw the strongest tool for the renewal of his diocese. In the argument between two Christian youth organisations ‚Äî Youth of Christ the King (sl) (whose members were known as the Mladci or Youth), led by the high-school teacher Ernest Tomec (sl), and the Guard (sl) academic club (whose members were known as the Stra≈æarji or Guards), led by theology professor Dr Lambert Ehrlich. Both groups claimed to represent Catholic Action ‚Äî Ro≈æman decided in favor of the Mladci. Second World War=Background and wartime situation in Slovenia In the interwar period Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia. The strongest political force in the province was the Slovenska Ljudska Stranka (SLS-Slovene People's Party), under the heavy influence of the Catholic Church. The Canadian historian Gregor Kranjc notes \\"In [SLS] propaganda the Catholic Church and national traditions were facing a colossal struggle against atheistic, international revolutionaries\\". Fascism exerted a strong attraction. In 1933 the SLS- friendly Catholic daily \\"Slovenec\\" (The Slovenian) wrote: \\"Whatever is positive in Fascism is taken from Christianity, and in this course Fascism must absolutely be part of the anti-Bolshevik front\\". The strongly anti- semitic leader of the SLS, Anton Koro≈°ec, was responsible for anti-Semitic laws Yugoslavia enacted in 1940, restricting Jews in entering schools and universities (see Antisemitism in Europe). Right-wing, fascist-inspired Catholic student organizations, such as Stra≈æa were active. All these became part of the collaborationist forces soon after the occupation. Following the invasion on 6 April 1941, the Axis powers divided the occupied territory between themselves. Nazi Germany annexed Lower Styria, but later dropped annexing Carinthia because of partisan activity. Italy annexed the so-called \\"Provincia di Lubiana\\" on 3 May 1941. Hungary realized their formal annexation on 16 December 1941. Although fascist Italy had brutally repressed Slovenes in the Littoral for two decades, they initially promised some (never-delivered) autonomy for Slovenes in the annexed Ljubljana Province and left most of the old administration in place. Italian was introduced as an optional language in schools and universities and at first, there was little violence. They accepted 18,000 refugees expelled from the German zone. This can be to some degree attributed to the cooperation (\\"collaboration\\") of notable Slovenian public figures. Collaboration with the occupiers began almost immediately. Ro≈æman, then SLS-head Marko Natlaƒçen and other prominent Slovenes pledged loyalty to Fascist Italy in April and May 1941. Later as the resistance grew, Italian authorities interned some 40,000 Slovenes in concentration camps, where 7,000 reportedly died. The Nazis chose a policy of violent Germanisation. They planned to expel 240,000 Slovenes, but due to partisan resistance expelled some 83,000 Slovenes to other parts of the Third Reich, as well as to Serbia and Croatia. More than 63,000 Slovenes were interned in Nazi concentration camps The Slovenian language was banned from public use, Slovenian cultural associations were dissolved, etc. The Nazis were hostile to the church: much of its property was confiscated, 448 priests were forced into exile, and the authorities rejected any intervention by the church. The Hungarian regime was similar to the German approach. Resistance was organized by the Liberation Front of the Slovene People, led by the Communist Party (CP), but including 18 other groups (Christian Socialists, the gymnastic group Sokol, etc.) The CP saw the occupation as a chance to gain power. It was weak in numbers but experienced in underground activities, because it was banned in Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front at first developed in the Italian occupation zone. On 16 September 1941 it declared it was the only \\"authorized\\" resistance. Traitors were to be sentenced to death. In this way Slovenes, including Church representatives (most notably Lambert Ehrlich, assassinated after he wrote a letter to the Fascist authorities, asking that they arm Slovenes, to jointly fight against the Partisans), were \\"liquidated\\" by \\"Security-Intelligence Service\\", called VOS, a unit recruited solely from CP and communist youth organization SKOJ. The inhabitants of the Province of Ljubljana, especially peasants, suffered from both Italian attacks on their lives and property and from partisan attacks. Partisans stayed in a village for a few weeks, confiscating food and property in return for \\"freedom loan\\" certificates promising the return of property after liberation. When the Italians located the partisans, the partisans fled and the Army punished the villagers. After a short period the soldiers retreated to their base, the partisans would return and the cycle continue. According to the fascist Commissar Grazioli, the Partisans liberated two-thirds of the Ljubljana Province by mid-1942. This caused the Italian fascist authorities to organize a brutal offensive against the Partisans in Summer 1942, with 80.000 well- armed Italian troops to combat some 2,500 to 3,000 poorly-armed Partisans. The Italians shot on the spot all Slovenes caught with arms or forged documents, relatives of Partisans and thousands of young Slovene men were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. With the aid of Slovene collaborationist forces, the fascist authorities also managed to kill some 1,000 Partisans. In the fall of 1942, at Ro≈æman's urging, the collaborationist forces (Slovene Legion, National Legion, Sokol Legion and Slovene Chetniks) gathered in \\"The Legion of Death\\", became part of the MVAC forces, armed and led by the Italian military. Later these collaborationist forces joined the SS-commanded Home Guard, to fight with the Germans against the Partisans. Meanwhile, American and British Allies sent observers to the Partisans. In recognition of their success in fighting Axis forces, the Allies formally recognized the Partisans in 1943, supporting them with arms and materiel. Partisans also performed \\"revolutionary\\" or \\"red\\" violence ‚Äì violence targeted against enemies. The enemies included people opposed to communism, especially Catholics, wealthier people, and ethnic German civilians. This violence was especially frequent and brutal in spring and early summer 1942 (which led to spontaneous creations of village guards against such violence)\\". Among the victims during the war were 46 diocesan priests and 6 priests belonging to different religious orders. By comparison, the occupiers killed 24 diocesan priests and 10 priests of different religious orders. On the other side, Slovene collaborationist forces, like the Black Hand organization, arrested, tortured, killed and turned over many Slovenes to the fascist and Nazi occupiers. One example is the noted Slovene author Boris Pahor who along with 600 other Slovenes was turned over to the Nazis by Slovene collaborationist forces, all of them sent to the Dachau concentration camps. Altogether more than 11.000 Slovenes were killed in Italian and German concentration camps. During the war, close to 70,000 Slovenes were killed by the fascist occupiers and their domestic collaborators, while some 4,000 Slovenes were killed on the collaborationist side during the war, and an additional 14,000 in reprisals after the war (the vast majority of the latter were soldiers in the collaborationist forces) Relations with Italians From left: Ignacij Nadrah, Fascist High Commissioner , Bishop Ro≈æman and Franc Kimovec, 22 April 1941 The bishop and Church dignitaries wanted the people to survive the war with as few victims as possible. Ro≈æman was convinced that for such a small nation an armed struggle against the occupying forces was doomed to fail, because the sacrifices would be out of proportion to any possible gains. After the Italians issued the Statute of Autonomy on 3 May 1941, they expected the bishop to write a declaration of loyalty. He addressed a so-called declaration of loyalty to High Commissioner , but the High Commissioner was not satisfied with its wording. He forged another declaration and directed it to Mussolini. Grazioli's text was published in the press. The original version read: > Excellency! A decree has been published today, via which the Slovenian > territory occupied by the Italian army has been incorporated into Italy. > When I consider this, I thank your Excellency ... I express absolute loyalty > and ask God to bless you and our aspirations for the welfare of our people. Ro≈æman actually emphasized free development in cultural and religious spheres and promised loyalty and sent blessings for the efforts of the authorities for the good of the people. The forgery was so effective that many publications still use it as a proof of Ro≈æman's collaboration. In his own diocesan newspaper, Ljubljanski ≈°kofijski list, Ro≈æman wrote that he actually told the fascist Commissioner, Grazioli, the following: \\"We are grateful to God that He has inspired in the leader of Greater Italy the thoughts of generous justice and considerate wisdom with which His Majesty ... suggested the foundation of the Province of Ljubljana\\" (Note: The Province of Ljubljana is what the fascist occupiers called the portion of Slovenia that Mussolini annexed directly to Italy).He had visited Italian High Commissioner Emilio Grazioli on Sunday 20 April 1941, two weeks after the Wehrmacht invasion, and, explaining his reasons for this in Ljubljanski ≈°kofijski list (Ljubljana Diocesan Gazette), published on 31 July 1941 Ro≈æman wrote that he had expressed to Grazioli the following: :\\"the gratitude of the clergy and of believers that the military has occupied the region peacefully, kept order and allowed the people freedom, especially in a religious sense; regarding the co-operation of Church representatives with the new Fascist Italy, for we Catholics God's word is decisive, which says 'Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, for there is no authority except God and those 'which God has established' (Romans 13:1). Via this standpoint we acknowledge the higher power that is above us and we will, following our consciences, 'be pleased to co-operate' to the honourable and eternal benefit of the people, among whom God's care for priests is asked\\". :\\"We are grateful to God that He has inspired in the leader of Greater Italy the thoughts of generous justice and considerate wisdom with which His Majesty ... suggested the foundation of the Ljubljana region\\". Ljubljanski ≈°kofijski list, pp. 4‚Äì6, 31 July 1941; quoted by Tamara Griesser Peƒçar & France Martin Dolinar, 'Ro≈æmanov Proces', pp. 50, 52, Ljubljana 1996. Slovenia 1945 by John Corsellis, Marcus Ferrar. Available online at Slovenia 1945, written by John Corsellis & Marcus Ferrar In his diocesan newspaper, Ro≈æman referred to the Italian occupiers as powers \\"which God has established\\" with whom Church representatives will \\"be pleased to co-operate\\". Ro≈æman welcomed Mussolini's annexation of a portion of Slovenia to Italy, and indicated his willingness to cooperate with the fascist occupiers. Former politicians such as former Ban Marko Natlaƒçen and the mayor of Ljubljana, Juro Adle≈°iƒç were brought to address a declaration to Italian authorities. The Italians dictated its wording. Ro≈æman celebrated Masses for the Italian troops, provided Italian-speaking confessionals and organized a Mass of thanksgiving for Mussolini on 22 May 1941 at St. Nicholas Cathedral, Ljubljana. Italian propaganda effort took full advantage of his willingness to oblige, leading to Ro≈æman being criticized by priests from Primorska region. Ro≈æman condemned the occupiers twice. On 24 October 1941 he wrote a letter to the clergy in which he complained about the devastation of the part of his diocese occupied by the Germans: in it all Church property was confiscated, religious enrollees of both sexes were expelled from their convents and 193 members of secular clergy expelled from 148 parishes and that about 200.000 of his people were without spiritual care. On 26 September 1942, Ro≈æman handed Grazzioli a memorandum, in which he criticized Italian means and proposed facilitating measures in 20 points. Grazzioli was furious and told him that if Ro≈æman were not a bishop, he would have had him arrested. Ro≈æman wanted to condemn Italians from the pulpit, but during his visit to Rome in May 1942 the Pope advised him not to do so because the Italians would detain him in Italy and he would be unable to help the people of Ljubljana. =12 September 1942 memo= In August 1942, the Italian generals Roatta and Robotti visited Ro≈æman and told him they would burn the whole Province of Ljubljana and kill or deport all of its inhabitants if the attacks by Partisans did not stop. Ro≈æman invited 21 representatives of the former political parties and of cultural institution to discuss the Italian threats (20 of whom came). They agreed only to organize help for the victims. After the meeting a memorandum was written. Only the German translation was located, leaving unanswered questions about its authors and quality of translation (the memorandum is in many respects similar to one written in April 1942 by the Rev Lambert Ehrlich, Ljubljana University theologian and supervisor of a right-wing Slovene Catholic student youth group, asking the fascist authorities, to similarly arm Slovenes to fight the Partisans) The bishop's contribution is unknown other than that he delivered the memorandum to General Robotti, commander of the Italian 11th Army Corps. The memo read: The document containing the German translation is in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Also preserved are Robotti's notes in which he refers to Ro≈æman as the author and adds, \\"[T]he security guards that the bishop suggests, correspond with local militias that have the task of defending their villages against communists, and to be available for actions in the local area ‚Äì there are many such militias, which count a total of 1,000 men. These are doing their work decisively, not only from a military standpoint, but also as police, as the bishop says ...\\".Ferenc, Tone (1987). Ljudska oblast na Slovenskem 1941‚Äì1942, prva knjiga: Dr≈æava v dr≈æavi (People's authority in Slovenia 1941‚Äì1942, book one: \\"A state within a state\\"). Zalo≈æba Borec =Memorandum Aftermath= The Italian fascist authorities followed through on many of the recommendations in Ro≈æman's memorandum. Jozo Tomasevich indicated that the bishop's support led to the rapid growth of the Italian-led MVAC units, which absorbed \\"The Legion of Death\\" forces which had informally collaborated with the Italians in their brutal offensive against the Partisans in the Summer of 1942. The Italians also released Yugoslav Army officers. At the urging of the SLS and other Slovene collaborationist groups, in March 1942 the Italians apprehended and sent to POW camps 1,100 Yugoslav Army officers, since Slovene collaborationist groups saw them as a threat. Now at the urging of the same SLS and Ro≈æman, the Italians released some of the officers, but only those willing to fight against the partisans. Relations with Liberation Front The main resistance group, the Liberation Front, which included groups such as the Social Christians, as well as priests, made multiple appeals to Ro≈æman. The first of these was a letter the leadership of the Liberation Front sent to Ro≈æman on 30 November 1941 They noted the increasing involvement of priests with right-wing groups which would form the core of Slovene collaborationist forces. At the same time the Liberation Front indicated its support for freedom of religion, and stated they would like to see more priests in their movement, or at the very least would like to see priests remain neutral. They also indicated that they would be willing to meet with Ro≈æman and discuss all issues. Ro≈æman never responded to the letter. Three additional letters were addressed to Ro≈æman in 1942, by Catholics in Liberation Front, beseeching him and other members of the Church not to support collaborationist forces, which were fighting on the side of the fascist occupiers, causing much Slovene bloodshed, and instead urged the church to remain neutral. Edvard Kocbek, leader of the Christian Socialists, wrote a fifth letter to Ro≈æman in 1943, criticizing Ro≈æman for not responding to the previous missives from the Liberation Front, and for continuing to allow priests to take part in the political and military work of collaborationist forces. As with previous letters, Ro≈æman did not respond to Kocbek either The Liberation Front included many believers in its ranks, and some 40 priests joined the partisans in Ljubljana Province alone. Among them was the noted historian, and priest, Metod Miku≈æ, who at one time had served as secretary to Ro≈æman. Miku≈æ and two other priest became members of the Plenum, the Liberation Front's highest governing body. For his activities among the partisans, Ro≈æman suspended Miku≈æ from the Church in 1943. Stance towards communism For Ro≈æman as well as for the most Church representatives, the fact that by communists dominated the \\"Liberation Front\\" (and performed murderous sanctions against the perceived traitors) presented a special dilemma. The Church detested the violation of human rights and repression, but also found Marxism and Bolshevism incompatible with Church doctrine. The ideological differences were the subject of the anti-communist encyclical Divini Redemptoris issued in 1937 by Pope Pius XI on which Ro≈æman based his stance. The bishop rejected in 1938 as irrelevant for Slovenia the Pope's clarification to French Roman Catholics that the encyclical did not require absolute noncooperation with Communists. The Communists began using violent methods to gain political power, which Church authorities could not accept. In 1943, after the siege and fall of Turjak and Battle of Grƒçarice, followed by mass liquidations at Jelendol, Mozelj and other places and the show trial in KoƒçevjeMore on this in: he dedicated all four Advent sermons to the evils of Communist ideology, citing Russia and Spain. Ro≈æman said that it is his duty to speak the truth, otherwise he would have to justify himself in front of God. He preached \\"Do zadnjega bom trdil in uƒçil, da je brezbo≈æni komunizem najveƒçje zlo in najveƒçja nesreƒça za slovenski narod\\" (\\"\\") At the funeral of Marko Natlaƒçen, who was executed by a member of VOS at home on 12 October 1942, Ro≈æman stated that there could be > no co-operation, no association with godlessness or those to whom > godlessness is a leading opinion. Stand firm in your belief in God, build > your future on God's Commandments, which alone can be a firm basis of > healthy development of any nation, big or small. Stay alive ‚Äì my nation ‚Äì > don't kill yourself and don't provoke measures able to corrupt your life > force. In his Pastoral letter about godless communism () on 30 November 1943 he urged Catholics to \\"fight godless Communism\\" through prayers. Ro≈æman wrote > I know that advocates of Communism and some other blind Catholics will > reproach me that I am meddling in politics in a pastoral letter, which isn't > a matter for a bishop and doesn't appertain to the Church. But, dear > believers, the battle against communism isn't political, but a religious > matter, as it touches upon belief in God, one of the most basic truths of > every faith, especially our Christian faith. To reject atheistic doctrines, > to defend the truths of our global religion is a religious matter and a > religious duty, that admits everyone with common sense. In his Christmas message to the Slovene Home Guard in 1944 Ro≈æman talked about shepherds in Bethlehem keeping watch over their flock in the fields and asked the Home Guard to take an example by them. > You are defending your nation against wolves and jackals who destroy lives > and property of their own fellow-countrymen, against 'tenants, who do not > care about their sheep', who are poisoning souls with foreign mentality of > godless communism and through that they break down the spiritual > foundations, on which all the spiritual wealth that we have in common with > Christian Europe, has been built for centuries. Interventions for prisoners Ro≈æman intervened for detainees directly with the Italian authorities and via the Vatican. He reportedly attempted to protect deportees (to Serbia, Croatia and Germany), including clergymen, refugees, Serbs, Jews, prisoners of war, and others. He intervened 1318 times on behalf of at least 1210 individuals. He intervened for various groups (for example 350 priests, deported to Croatia by Germans or 1700 children in the Italian concentration camps) covering more than 2495 people. The bishop's secretary, Dr , testified that up to 50 petitioners came on a single day and that he helped them regardless of their political views. Among many documents a letter written by Gastone Gambarra, Commander of the Italian XI Army Corps, on 26 April 1943 documents that 122 internees were released because of his intervention. But the Italians noticed the bishop made no distinctions in his choices, so Grazioli ordered his subordinates to treat the bishop's interventions with no greater alacrity than those of anyone else, as the bishop had been purportedly intervening for the \\"unworthy\\".For a full list of people for whom Ro≈æman intervened, read: Some of Ro≈æman's interventions were made to gain officers for collaborationist forces. In his 12 September 1942 letter to the fascist general Robotti (quoted above), Ro≈æman wrote that only \\"dependable\\" former Yugoslav officers, i.e. those willing to fight on the fascist side, should be released from Italian POW camps. The Italians followed Rozman's recommendations, releasing only \\"dependable\\" officers, while keeping all others in concentration camps. In the same letter Ro≈æman proposed the fascist authorities create Slovene collaborationist units and Secret Police, to capture and turn over Slovenes to the occupiers, something both the Italians and Nazis implemented In 1946 in Rome, Ro≈æman himself told Bishop Joe B. ≈Ωabkar: \\"All the contacts I have had with the Italians, I sincerely regret. All of them. I have not achieved one thing, haven't rescued not one hostage, prevented not one deportation, saved not even one house from arson fire, eased not one single suffering. Nothing, absolutely nothing. They always promised me everything, but never gave me anything.\\" Relations with Germans Leon Rupnik, Bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman and SS-General Erwin R√∂sener. Leon Rupnik, Bishop Ro≈æman and SS-General Erwin R√∂sener review Home Guard troops in front of Ursuline Church, Ljubljana, after the second Home Guard oath of allegiance, on 30 January 1945. After the capitulation of Italy (September 1943), Ljubljana was occupied by the Germans. On 14 September 1943, Nazi Gauleiter, Friedrich Rainer, met with Ro≈æman to consult with him on setting up the new Nazi administration. Rainer had led the Germanization of the Slovene provinces of Styria, Carinthia and Upper Carniola, where he expelled 83,000 Slovene priests, teachers and others to Serbian and Nazi concentration camps, confiscated Slovene businesses and church property, and forbade the use of the Slovene language in schools and public institutions. Rainer told Ro≈æman that Upper Carniola, like Styria and Carinthia, would remain annexed to Nazi Germany, but promised Nazi support to Slovene collaborationists. Ro≈æman gave Rainer a surprisingly detailed account of battles Slovene collaborationist forces were waging against the partisans, Rainer asked Ro≈æman's opinion of Leon Rupnik (Slovene mayor of Ljubljana under the Fascists, and a notorious anti-Semite), whom he planned to appoint Nazi administrator of Ljubljana. Ro≈æman concurred with the appointment, stating that he knew no one better qualified for the job Rupnik was appointed as president of the Nazi provincial government on 22 September 1943. Ro≈æman was photographed multiple times at formal and informal events chatting with SS General Erwin R√∂sener, the commander of German forces in the province, who ordered the execution of Slovene civilians, hostages and prisoners of war,One of R√∂sener's execution notices: http://shrani.si/files/0s3cj.jpg. It reads: \\"Notice: It has been ascertained that the majority of the male inhabitants of the villages of Gradische (Gradi≈°ƒçe pri Lukovici) and Koreno, Kreis Stein, have joined bands [of rebels], while the rest of the population have constantly supported them with reports and food and despite their knowledge of the location and activities of bandits not notified the authorities. For this reason, both villages have been destroyed by fire, the male inhabitants aged over 18 have been shot and the rest of the population evicted\\". Other notices of large scale executions ordered by R√∂sener in June, July and November 1942: http://img462.imageshack.us/img462/570/banditenbekanntmachungsty1.jpg actions which led to his name being on the indictment for war crimes at Nuremberg.Count 3(C) Murder and Ill-Treatment of Prisoners of War: \\"In Yugoslavia the German Command and the occupying authorities in the person of the chief officials of the Police, the SS troops (Police Lieutenant General Rosener) and the Divisional Group Command (General Kubler and others) in the period 1941‚Äì43 ordered the shooting of prisoners of war\\". . From 1943 until the end of the war, Ro≈æman was closely associated with the anti-Partisan, anti-communist Domobranci, the Slovenian Home Guard forces formed by order of SS General R√∂sener on 24 September 1943. Ro≈æman support of the Nazis and his antisemitism is evident in a pastoral letter published on 30 November 1943, in which Ro≈æman wrote \\"only by this courageous fighting and industrious work for God, for the people and the Fatherland will we, under the leadership of Germany, assure our existence and better future in the fight against the Jewish conspiracy.\\" Ro≈æman held a silent mass prior to the Home Guard swearing a collective oath of allegiance to the German forces at Ljubljana's central stadium on 20 April 1944. According to some witnesses, he chose to observe events from the background despite the offer of place on the main stand, and left quickly afterwards. He declined to hold the mass at the second swearing in on 30 January 1945, but was present at the subsequent Home Guard parade in front of the Ursuline Church. This decision led to speculation about his motives. In his Christmas message to the Home Guard at the end of 1944, Ro≈æman wrote: \\"You are defending your nation against wolves and jackals ... who are poisoning souls with the foreign mentality of atheistic communism\\". Opposed to the western Allies' recognition of the Partisans and their support for the Tito-≈†uba≈°iƒá Agreement, in March of 1945 Ro≈æman and Leon Rupnik wrote a letter to the Ustashe leader, Ante Paveliƒá, proposing a political and military alliance to continue fighting the Partisans, and to try to gain recognition for the Slovene Home Guard, Ustashe and Chetniks from the Western allies. Post-war At the end of the war, he fled to the British zone of Austria.Ladislav Bevc, an eyewitness wrote that \\"[D]espite the British roadblocks around Lienz, the refugees generally could find a way to circumvent them and filter into Anras, a mountain village to which Bishop Ro≈æman had removed himself. The bishop still had his car which was driven by his chaplain.\\" Profile, dangel.net; accessed 10 October 2015. Ro≈æman was tried for treason in absentia by the military court of the 4th Yugoslav Army. He was convicted and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and forced labour, lifelong loss of citizenship and limitation of citizen rights on 30 August 1946. As Ro≈æman had left Slovenia without the pope's permission, he was never assigned another formal position in the Church, and he was also denied ad limina access to the Pope. After the war Various leading Catholic figures from Yugoslavia were indicted for alleged war crimes, but escaped from justice, including Bishop Ivan ≈†ariƒá of Vrhbosna in Sarajevo, who had supported the forcible conversion of non-Catholics to Catholicism. Ro≈æman, ≈†ariƒá and others had been living under British supervision at the bishop's palace at Klagenfurt, Austria, in October 1946.PRO, FO 371; Jasenovac-Donja Gradina: Industry of Death, 1941‚Äì45 Ro≈æman began to appear in American and British intelligence reports as being involved in ratlines that spirited wanted Axis and collaborationist fugitives out of Europe.MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service, Stephen Dorril, The Free Press, New York, 2000, pp. 864‚Äì907; . pp 330, 332, 335, 339, 341‚Äì2, 350, 434. To get an American visa, Ro≈æman did not visit the consulate in Bern; he communicated with the United States Consulate General at Z√ºrich on 25 May for the purpose of obtaining a visitor's visa to the United States. On 28 May, he appeared at the Consulate General where he was informed of U.S. regulations regarding the issue of a non-quota immigration visa as a minister of religion.

Rehabilitation and lawsuits After Slovene independence in the 1990s, a request was made by the Catholic Church, to reevaluate Ro≈æman's conviction. An official request for the reevaluation was made by Slovenian Public Prosecutor Anton Drobniƒç prior to the visit to Slovenia by Pope John Paul II in 1999.Vecernje novosti, 13 February 1996 Anton Drobniƒç ordered two historians, Tamara Griesser Peƒçar and France M. Dolinar, to prepare a thesis or defence for this retrial. This was later published in Ro≈æmanov proces. On the basis that he should have had the right to defend himself, Ro≈æman's 1946 conviction was overturned by the Slovenian Supreme Court in 2007 and his case sent to the court of first instance for retrial.

Scholars who have made a study of the various legends and traditions associated with the ruins, find it clear that they are many contradictions. Archaeological evidence has shed some lights on these events, but a great deal of work still remains to be done. It is certain that Dzata was built at an earlier date than many people are willing to admit . Radiocarbon dates suggest a beginning shortly after AD 1700, with an end some 50 to 60 years later. Documentary proof of this is found in Dutch records, which refer to an interview in 1730 with an African by the name of Mahumane, who had visited the kingdom of Thovhele some five years previously. Mahumane described a settlement built of dark-blue stone, with a wall enclosing the whole area. He also mentioned that the chief cities are made of the same stone. To date no stone-walled settlement has been found that is made of dark blue stone, other than Dzata. There is no doubt that Dzata was the capital of united Venda. It is not clear what the role of the legendary Thohoyandou was at this stage. It is highly unlikely that he could remain chief throughout this period of a minimum of 50 years that Dzata was the capital. Oral history indicates very strongly that it was after the disappearance of Thohoyandou that Dzata was abandoned, and the Venda nation fragmented once more into independent chiefdoms. It seems very likely that Thohoyandou expanded the Venda empire to cover areas as far south as the Olifants River near Phalaborwa. No doubt trade played an important role in this. Dzata ruins is now one of the national monuments in South Africa.

It is not known what food vessels were used for and they only received their name as antiquarians decided they were not beakers (regarded as drinking-vessels) and so it provided a good contrast. Recently, the concept of the food vessels was questioned by many archaeologists in favour of a concept of two different traditions: the bowl tradition and the vase tradition. Vases are tall vessels with their height being greater than their largest diameter, while bowls are short vessels with their height being less than or equal to their greatest diameter (Gibson 2002, 95). Description Food vessel fabric is coarse and thick and sometimes has elaborate rims in comparison to beakers, which have fine fabrics and simple rims (Gibson & Woods 1997, 158). Food vessels generally have complex decoration, and are of a similar form to other second millennium vessels, such as collared urns and accessory vessels, suggesting they all stemmed from the same type of Neolithic vessel (Gibson & Woods 1997, 162). The earliest food vessels are of the bowl form and first appear in Ireland during the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age transition (~2400 BC). It is a possibility that vessels discovered in Scotland and Ireland dated to the Early/Middle Neolithic, known as impressed wares, are the precursor of the food vessel (Gibson 2002, 95). The single-burial tradition dominate and together with the pottery the feature is cited to have strong roots in the beaker tradition that dominates in many areas of western Europe. They may have reached Ireland via Britain from the lowland areas around the Rhine or farther north. In Ireland food vessels coincide with beakers and have been found all over.Britannica 15th edition, History: Early Ireland, Bronze Age In Britain food vessels are attested around 2200 BC and are most prevalent at the time beaker pottery was being replaced by other types of ceramic, such as cordoned urns and collared urns. In Britain they have a distinct focus in the north. Food vessels occur frequently with both inhumations and cremations in Britain and Ireland (Burgess 1980, 82). Food Vessel culture The Food Vessel Culture is a name given by some archaeologists to a culture of northern Britain and Ireland during the Early Bronze Age c.2100-1700 BC (Burgess 1995, 145) due to the material culture of the people. The term Food Vessel Culture is not generally used in modern archaeological reports as the term is seen as rather outdated due to changes in archaeological theory. References *Burgess, C.

Located just off Laisvƒós alƒója (Freedom Avenue), the church is somewhat hidden away and can be accessed from Laisves aleja through a gate at a hotel which is located nearby the Court building on Laisves alƒója. The exact date when the church was built is unknown, but it must have been in the 15th century. It was built as a churchyard chapel in the location of the former burial-ground nearby the city border near the road leading to Vilnius. In 1503 Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander designated the church as a parish church of Kaunas. In the middle of the 16th century a bell tower was attached. The church was damaged in 1655 during the Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667). It was rebuilt only around 1680. Around 1750 a wooden hospital was attached to the church. In 1782 it was abandoned for a long time, and at the time there were 5 monks from order of St. Roch residing. In 1796 the church was renovated, organs installed, and living quarters for a parson established. The church was consecrated in 1794. In 1812 Kaunas suffered from a major fire, which also damaged the church. The hospital was abandoned, and in 1824 transferred to the sister order of Caritas. The monastery was closed in 1864 after the January Uprising. The old hospital was demolished in 1880. In 1921 the church was assigned to the Congregation of Marian Fathers and a monastery was built nearby. In 1920 the church was daubed. In 1992 a complex renovation of the church and monastery took place. Since 1991 the Mass is held in the church again, and the Marianites monastery has been returned to the monks.

Founded as Ravenshaw College in 1868, the institution became a university in 2006. The university has nine schools, thirty three academic departments and a student enrolment of nearly 8,000. It is one of the oldest educational institutes in the country and its history is synonymous with the history of modern Odisha. History=Early years After the great famine of 1866, the people of Odisha and some liberal Britons wanted to start a college at Cuttack. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, officiating commissioner of Odisha Division made the government of Bengal realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting college educations and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first college in Odisha was born in January 1868 with intermediate classes and six students. Commissioner Ravenshaw proposed to convert the Collegiate School into a full-fledged degree college. The government of Bengal accepted the demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs.30,000 be deposited for the proposed college. Ravenshaw took up the matter as an object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the required amount. H. Woodrew, DPI of Bengal supported Ravenshaw. H. J. Reynolds, secretary to the government of Bengal requested the government of India to sanction the incidental charges and the post of the principal on the additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public donation. Due to Ravenshaw's efforts and the financial support of Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, HH Shri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo, the college department of the Collegiate School was converted in 1876 to a full-fledged Government Degree College bearing the name Cuttack College affiliated to the University of Calcutta. Samuel Ager was appointed as the first principal. The college had only 19 students. H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000 as a permanent endowment which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the government for public contribution. On his insistence the name was changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after Thomas Edward Ravenshaw to commemorate his services to the cause of education in Odisha. The college was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth in the initial days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97. Science stream remained confined only to intermediate level until 1912 when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal.it is the college where many of our freedom fighters have completed their graduation. Ravenshaw in the 20th century The college entered a new phase of development after 1912. School and survey classes were removed. Teachers of Indian Education Service were appointed as professors. New subjects such as Political Economy, Political Philosophy and honours in History and Persian were introduced. Infrastructure facilities for teaching of science at B.Sc. level were augmented. The student strength rose to 280 in 1912 and 375 in 1915. A new site (the present site) for the college at Chakkar Padia was located by the government to construct a complete set of new buildings at an approximate cost of Rs.10,00,000. In 1916 the University Bill proposed the transfer of Ravenshaw College from Calcutta University to Patna University. Although there was some public resistance for the change of affiliation, the then commissioner rightly supported the transfer by writing \\"Divorced from the Calcutta University, its progress would be rapid and in course of time it should be able to supply every educational need of the people of Odisha.\\" Accordingly, the affiliation was transferred to newly created Patna University on 1 October 1917. The college was shifted to its present site in the erstwhile Chakkar Padia in 1921. While laying the foundation stone of the present building in November 1919 Sir Edward Gait, the governor of Bihar and Odisha wished that this mighty monument would one day grow into a university. The Maharaja of Mayurbhanj donated Rs. 1,00,000 for the electrification of the new building and purchase of equipment for science laboratories. A library building with an area of was opened in 1922 by Lt. Governor of Bihar and Odisha. Maharaja of Kanika Sri Rajendra Narayan Bhanjadeo generously donated Rs. 55,000 for its construction which stands today as a beautiful piece of architecture. In his honour the library is named Kanika Library and is very close to the hearts of educated Odias. In recognition of the public generosity, the government sanctioned Rs. 25,000 towards purchase of books for the new Kanika Library. After the shifting of the main library to the centenary building, the old premises houses the journal section. Legislators from Odisha such as Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das and Sri Krishna Mohapatra demanded time and again for further growth of the college in Bihar Odisha Legislative Council and Viceroy's Council. In the words of Krishna Mohapatra \\"Orissa had a pet child and that child was the Ravenshaw College.\\" In response to public pressure, Mathematics honours got recognition by 1920. A year later affiliation was granted to B.Sc. in Botany and the college became a postgraduate institution with M.A. classes in English started in 1922 through the munificence of Maharani Smt. Parvati Devi, the queen of Sonepur, in granting Rs. 1,71,500 for its opening. The staff position of Ravenshaw College was strengthened with the appointment, in 1918, of scholars such as Sir Jaudunath Sarkar and R. P. Khosla as professors of History and Economics respectively. By 1922 the sanctioned strength of teaching staff had reached 31, out of which 13 came from Indian Education Service, two were Europeans and the rest were from provincial Education Service. Honours classes in Physics, Chemistry and Botany were opened from July 1930 and steps were initiated to start postgraduate teaching in all subjects which was fulfilled after Odisha became a separate province. Co- education began in 1929‚Äì30 with four girl students taking admission in the college. Their number gradually rose over the years. Medical facilities opened in the college with the appointment of a sub-assistant surgeon and medical examination became compulsory for all students from October 1929. The college remained affiliated to Patna University even after the separation of Odisha from Bihar in 1936. The affiliation was transferred to the newly-created Utkal University in 1943. In fact, it was Ravenshaw College that gave birth to the new university, nursed and sustained it. If walls could speak, the present zoology department building could say how the university started functioning on its premises more than half a century ago. The law department of Ravenshaw College was separated and gave birth to the Madhusudan Law College. Ravenshaw in the freedom struggle Ravenshaw's Assembly Hall was the venue of the Legislative Assembly of the new state of Odisha. It witnessed the debates of the legislators framing laws to govern the state. It remained so until the capital was shifted to Bhubaneswar. All the significant cultural, intellectual and political movements of the state have sprung from its portals. It has nourished such great and kindred souls as Madhusudan Das, Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara Das, Nilakantha Das, Godabaris Mishra and Bhubanananda Das. It had on its staff such great scholars as Artaballav Mohanty, Jadunath Sarkar, Sir Ross Masood, Pranakrushna Parija, Balabhadra Prasad, Acharya Jogeschandra Vidyanidhi, Mahendra Kumar Rout, Baba Kartar Singh, Parasuram Mishra, Shri P.A. Sunderam and A.K. Dasgupata, to name a few. Most of the prominent political leaders of the state such as Shri Biswanath Das, H.K. Mahatab, Shri Nityananda Kanungo, Shri S.N.Dwibedi, Shri Biju Patnaik, Shri Nilamani Routray, Smt. Nandini Satpathy, Shri Janaki Ballav Patnaik and Shri Rabi Ray etc., were Ravenshavians. The college produced such creative writers of yesteryear as Sri Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Sri Ananda Shankar Ray, Sri Gopinath Mohanty, Sri Sachidananda Routray and Sri Surendranath Mohanty. In short, the college has been the major source of preparing manpower to lead every sphere of the society. In the Dimond Jubilee celebration address the then principal H.R. Batheja rightly observed: \\"we have at last a temple of learning, fair to look on, stately in proportions which compares not unfavorably with the only other temple ‚Äì The temple of Jaganath for which Odisha is known all over India. The twin monuments represent Odisha to the outside world and are source of justice and pride to every Oriya\\". Ravenshaw after independence Ravenshaw Convention Centre Indian Science Congress Association meet of 1962 was held in Ravenshaw College Quadrangle. The College achieved the unique distinction of being one of the three colleges of the country to have been awarded national honour by the government of India through the issue of a commemorative stamp in 1978. The college has seen 55 principals. It has been accorded autonomous status since 1989. It stands today on a sprawling campus of . The magnificent red brick building of Gothic architecture has had several blocks added to it. The main library is in the new centenary library building. Government of Odisha accorded it unitary state university status in the year 2006 by passing the Ravenshaw University act. Subsequently, it got accredited with University Grants Commission under the section 2f of the UGC act. This was possible because of the efforts of the first vice chancellor of the university, Devdas Chhotray. Since then a number of self-financing courses have been offered and the student strength has increased dramatically. Teaching is now imparted to more than 7000 students in Arts, Science and Commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, information technology and hotel and hospitality management. Altogether there are 33 academic departments out of which 28 have postgraduate teaching facility and M.Phil. and Ph.D. courses are available in 22 departments. In addition, several new courses have been added under autonomous functioning besides the regular courses. There are 11 hostels, 9 of which are on the campus, accommodating about 2,500 boarders. A new 140 acre campus is being built at Naraj in Cuttack. The college houses, besides Ravenshaw Junior College having student strength of 1536, the Cuttack Study Centre of Indira Gandhi National Open University having student strength of 1133, IAS Coaching Class and Pre-Examination Training Centre for SC/ST students. The campus has a post office, an extension counter of the State Bank of India, a dispensary, a powerhouse, GED, PWD and PHS sections, a canteen, guest house, a gymnasium, and spacious play grounds. Ravenshaw has acquired a distinctive, secular, cosmopolitan culture of its own helping all Ravenshawvians to live in the University motto \\"Skill is our power\\". Emblem The emblem is designed in three segments, separated by a river and its tributaries. The microscope on left symbolizes the insatiable human spirit of enquiry and scientific research fostered by this institution. The palm leaf manuscripts on a stand with a writing instrument on the right represent the great storehouse of accumulated wisdom of past generations and the pursuit of creativity which are the hallmarks of this institution. The open book at the bottom epitomizes the dissemination of knowledge and wisdom which the college inculcates in its countless scholars. The river and its tributaries suggest the endless flow of knowledge through great stretches of time and the perennial flow of life, its unity and diversity. Academics Ravenshaw University has nine degree-granting schools and they offer undergraduate programs in science, arts, commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, hospitality and hotel management and information technology; graduate programs in science, arts, commerce, management (MBA) and computer application (MCA); and master of philosophy and doctoral degree programs in science, arts and commerce. Schools and Departments *School of Languages (Departments: Hindi, Odia, Sanskrit and English) *School of Regional Studies & Earth Sciences (Departments: Geology and Applied geography) *School of Social Sciences (Departments: Economics, History, Philosophy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Sociology, International Studies, Rural Development, Education and Journalism and Mass Communication) *School of Life Sciences (Departments: Botany, Biotechnology and Zoology) *School of Mathematical Sciences (Departments: Mathematics and Statistics) *School of Information & Computer Sciences (Departments: Electronics and Telecommunication, Information Science and Technology, Information Technology and Management, Computer Science and Computer Applications) *School of Physical Sciences (Departments: Chemistry and Physics) *School of Commerce (Department of Commerce) *School of Management Studies (Departments: Business Administration, Hospitality & Hotel Administration, Integrated MBA in Financial Markets and MBA) Admissions Admissions to various undergraduate, graduate, master of philosophy and doctoral degree programs are made through entrance examinations held every year. Research Ravenshaw has been at the forefront of the research activities since its inception. Established as the first institution of Odisha for higher education, master of philosophy and doctoral degrees were awarded by the various departments of Ravenshaw for the first time in the history of Odisha. However, keeping in mind the changing scenario of modern science and technology, its research infrastructure and library facilities are now being augmented through external research grants and internal resources. Currently 22 departments of the university offer master of philosophy and doctoral degrees. Campus The current campus sits on an 87-acre campus in the heart of Cuttack. The campus is located very close to the Cuttack railway station, and is only about a 45 minutes‚Äô drive from the Bhubaneswar airport. The university has acquired another 140 acres of land on the bank of the river Mahanadi, to build the second campus for its new disciplines of management and applied sciences. The foundation stone of the new campus at Naraj has been laid by Naveen Patnaik. The facilities in the campus include State Bank of India branch, Post Office, Students Information Bureau, Gymnasium and State Bank of India ATM and Axis Bank ATM. A state-of-the-art indoor sports complex will also be established in the campus. Hostels The university has 13 hostels,7 for boys and 6 for girls. These hostels accommodate 1400 boys and 2200 girls students. Mahanadi and Lalitgiri hostels with capacity to accommodate 600 girls and 400 boys were recently inaugurated by Naveen Patnaik. Ravenshaw Radio Ravenshaw Radio 90.4 MHz is Odisha's first campus community radio station (CRS). It started broadcasting from April 2011. However, it has faced repeated problems and failed to provide continuous broadcasting services to the students and local community.

It provides a set of tools for working with localization file formats and files that might need localization. The toolkit also provides an API on which to develop other localization tools. The toolkit is written in the Python programming language. It is free software originally developed and released by Translate.org.za in 2002 and is now maintained by Translate.org.za and community developers. Translate Toolkit uses Enchant as spellchecker. History The toolkit was originally developed as the mozpotools by David Fraser for Translate.org.za. Translate.org.za had focused on translating KDE which used Gettext PO files for localization. With an internal change to focus on end-user, cross- platform, OSS software, the organisation decided to localize the Mozilla Suite. This required using new tools and new formats that were not as rich as Gettext PO. Thus mozpotools was created to convert the Mozilla DTD and .properties files to Gettext PO. Various tools were developed as needed, including \`pocount\`, a tool to count source text words to allow correct estimations for work, \`pogrep\`, to search through translations, and \`pofilter\`, to check for various quality issues. When Translate.org.za began translating OpenOffice.org it was only natural that the Translate Toolkit would be adapted to handle the OpenOffice.org internal file format. Translating OpenOffice.org using PO files is now the default translation method. As part of the WordForge project the work received a major boost and the toolkit was further extended to manage XLIFF files alongside PO files. Further funded development has added other features including the ability to convert Open Document Format to XLIFF and the management of placeholders (Variables, acronyms, terminology, etc.). Design goals The main aim of the toolkit is to increase the quality of localisation and translation. This is achieved by firstly, focusing on good localisation formats thus the toolkit makes use of the PO and XLIFF localisation formats. This has the benefit that it stops the proliferation of localization formats and allows localizers to work with one good localization tool. For the toolkit this means building converters that can transform files to be translated into these two basic formats. Secondly, to build tools that allow localizers to increase the general quality of their localization. These tools allow for the extraction of terminology and for checking for the consistent use of terminology. The tools allow for checking for various technical errors such as the correct use of variables. Lastly, the toolkit provides a powerful localisation API that acts as a base on which to build other localization related tools. Users Many translators use the toolkit directly, to do quality checks and to transform files for translation. Further there are and have been several indirect users of the Translate Toolkit API: * Pootle - an online translation tool * open- tran - providing translation memory lookup (was shut down on January 31, 2014.) * Wordforge (old name Pootling) - an offline translation tool for Windows and Linux * Rosetta - free translation web service offered by LaunchPad. It is used mainly by the Ubuntu community translation tool. See it in action in Launchpad Translations * LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org - most community localization is done through PO files produced by the toolkit * Virtaal - a localisation and translation tool * translatewiki.net (now discontinued due to new terms) * Weblate - web based translation tool with tight Git integration Supported Document Formats * Primary Localization Formats ** Gettext PO ** XLIFF (Normal and PO representations) * Other Localization Related Formats ** TBX ** Java .properties ** Qt .ts, .qm and .qph (Qt Phrase Book) ** Gettext .mo ** OmegaT glossaries ** Haiku catkeys files * Other Formats ** OpenDocument Format ** Plain Text ** Wiki: DokuWiki and MediaWiki syntax ** Mozilla DTD ** OpenOffice.org SDF ** PHP strings ** .NET Resource files (.resx) ** OS X strings ** Adobe Flex files ** INI file ** Windows / Wine .rc files ** iCalendar ** Symbian localization files ** Subtitles * Translation Memory Formats ** TMX ** Wordfast TM OpenDocument Format support Work was started in June 2008 to incorporate OpenDocument Format support.

The Mini-Mag Orion system achieves propulsion by compressing fissile material in a magnetic field, a Z-pinch, until fission occurs. This fission reaction propels the craft. MMO should be able to propel 100 tons to Mars within 3 months or to Jupiter in about one year.  History  In June 2000, Andrews Space concluded a Phase I NASA Small Business Innovation Research project on an iteration of the original Project Orion concept termed MagOrion. MagOrion introduced the use of a large, 2 km diameter, superconducting ring to interact with the plasma debris of the nuclear explosive pulses; replacing the mechanically dampened pusher plate of the original Project Orion concept. This enabled specific impulses above 10,000 seconds with initial system Thrust to Weight ratios from 0.2-10. The study also identified several potential show- stoppers for MagOrion; the brittleness of superconductors and their susceptibility to critical self-field limitations, the technical challenge of constructing a 2 km diameter superconductor in space as well as the political difficulty of launching a device capable of ejecting nuclear explosives at high repetition rates. These concerns led to the next iteration in the Orion family of designs, Mini-MagOrion (MMO), which are discussed here. The MMO program was funded jointly by NASA and the US Department of Energy (DOE)  Concept  The Mini-MagOrion (MMO) concept attempts to address the identified short-comings of the MagOrion concept. The MMO design adds two important aspects to the family of Orion concepts. First, the use of magnetic compression of the fissile targets enables the utilization of much smaller explosions, 50-500 GJ yield vs. 20,000 GJ, which are triggered by an external device and thus cannot be projected as a potential weapon. Second, using smaller yield explosions allowed for the replacement of the large superconducting ring with a more sophisticated assembly of several coils arranged into a nozzle like configuration.  Testing  Andrews Space worked together with the US Sandia National Laboratories to conduct several experiments that demonstrated key components of the MMO design. The first experiment, conducted on the SNL Saturn machine, showed that mylar, in the form of plastic foil, could be used as a conductor to direct the current into the fuel pellet which would then set up the imploding magnetic field to compress it. The second test was conducted on the SNL Z-Machine, the world's most powerful x-ray emitter and z-pinch at that time. The experiment was intended to measure the relationship between the applied power pulse and the resulting compression ratio of the target. The experiments did not use fissile material, but a number of inert heavy elements, gold, tungsten, etc., to avoid contamination of the facility. The results were inconclusive due to challenges with the measurement equipment used to determine the compression ratio.  Media  The July 2003 issue of Aerospace Engineering, published by SAE Aerospace, had a brief article about the Mini-MagOrion program and the pulse power experiments at Sandia National Laboratories.Aerospace Engineering, SAEAerospace, July 2003, page 19, written by Kevin Jost Due to its close relationship to the original Project Orion, the MMO concept continues to be discussed throughout the blogosphere.

It was produced by NAS and TV Tokyo and animated by Ashi Productions. It is a loosely based literary adaptation on the novel Two Years' Vacation (1888) by French author Jules Verne. Plot During an excursion with the marine club, a group of children is transported to what is later revealed as the planet Noah, a strange world that holds both human inhabitants on the scientific level of the middle ages as well as various types of dinosaurs. They quickly make friends with talking Pteranodon Zans and Manua, an inhabitant of Noah, who helps them out on more than one occasion. While trying to find a way back home, the children learn more about the new world they're in, discovering the people and dinosaurs suffer from oppression by the king as well as the church's prohibition of science. They get into conflict with General Mosar who is interested in their advanced technology and consequently have to flee from the king's army as well as the priests who try to capture Zans, who incidentally is the son of White Wing, the famous but passed leader of the rebellion. Characters ; : Although technically Shachou is their leader, Kashira usually takes charge in dire situations. While generally a good person, he is rarely serious and likes to fool around, occasionally so on the expenses of others, unintentionally angering them. He is very courageous, sporty and ready to take great risks in order to save his friends. Tends to fall for girls easily and flirts around without hesitation. Doesn't really get along with God. ; : Initially, she is God's fianc√©e; however, she insists on that it is a decision their parents have made and that she has not yet concurred. She is a bit spoiled, but has a good heart and sincerely cares for her friends (especially later in the series). She appears to be somewhat interested in Kashira. ; : Being the oldest of the group, Shachou is elected as their leader early on. However, since he is not very decisive, his tries of discussing over and voting on anything are usually undermined by the group. Although he is easily frightened and not as physically adept as the other boys, he will not hesitate to protect his friends. At first drawn towards Manua, he later takes interest in Tiger. Carries a mirror and a comb with him wherever he goes. ; : A bit of a tomboy, Tiger knows how to shoot and fight. She is the only one of the girls usually taking part in dangerous actions. Kashira once remarks that he would like his brother to be as strong as her. Nevertheless, she's also a romantic at heart. Does not like ghosts, thunderstorms and coldness. Develops feelings for Shachou towards the end of the series. ; : God is probably the most egoistic of the children. He is initially engaged with Hime, but she doesn't seem to approve too much. God usually opposes the others' opinions and decisions, especially in regard to Kashira. He joins General Mosar for a while, telling him how guns work. On a number of occasions, he tries to betray the group by running away alone or with Hime, Asuka or his followers Snake and O-Taku, but mostly without success. While he mostly acts foolishly selfish and gets the group in trouble, on rare occasions it is depicted that he actually does care for beings besides himself. ; : Snake is a sort of friend/underling of God and keeps following him around although God keeps scolding and punching him. When he's not under God's thumb he can act quite smart. ; : A rather massive, but easy-going fellow who tries to act as a moderating voice and is quite skilled in cooking. ; : A typical meganekko, Hakase is tech-savvy and intelligent. Although she isn't talking much, she is far from shy and will raise her voice if necessary (i.e. if it's a topic she feels knowledgeable in). ; : A young girl who is Ben's romantic interest. ; : O-Taku is God's younger brother, thus following him around most of the time, yet it is hinted that he does not concur with the majority of his actions. When idle, he is mostly seen playing videogames on his handheld. Takes a liking in O-Jou and thus dislikes Ben. Although he's not a principally bad person, he doesn't really follow altruistic motives either. ; : Kashira's younger brother. He's nice and less reckless than his elder sibling. Fancies O-Jou. ; : A young girl who is easily upset and tends to cry a lot. Obsessed with General Mosar whom she starts to call \\"uncle\\" as the show progresses. ; : One of the younger kids and closest friend of Zans; usually carries him around. ; & : Twin brothers who are probably the youngest members of the crew. One more shy and frightful, the other more reckless. ; : A speaking Pteranodon and son of White Wing, passed leader of the rebellion. He is cowardish and easily scared at first, but becomes more courageous as the story progresses and ultimately decides to become head of the rebels. ; : A dutiful general directly under the king's command, he opposes the church and instead deems the advanced technology of the children to be beneficial to his country. After he learns that the high priest is actually trying to take over the power and manipulates the king, he stops pursuit of the group and becomes an ally instead. ; : The daughter of a local mayor, she is very concerned about the current state of Noah, especially considering the suppression and torture of dinosaurs that are kept as slaves. When she meets with the children, she decides to leave her hometown and later joins the rebellion. ; : A young inventor, he meets the children who see his (not working) flying machine. After they help him finish it, they quickly become friends. He later becomes the assistant of da Ponta, another famous inventor who has been exiled. Subsequently, Mint falls in love with Princess Asuka. ; : The leader of a group of bandits who are actually rebels against the king and the church. He and Manua take a liking in each other. ; : The spoiled, but truly lonely princess of Noah. She has a pet dino called Miyu/Myu. Initially, she is not very nice to the children, who are held captive in the palace, teasing them. But after a dressing-down from Kashira, they become friends and she helps them escape. Her interest shifts from Kashira first to Mint later on. ; : A priestess who does not view technology as evil and therefore aids da Ponta in his studies.

He is perhaps best known today for his compositions for the viola. Flackton was born in Canterbury and was the eldest surviving son of John Flackton and Catharine Sharp. He demonstrated a talent for music from an early age and at the age of nine he was admitted as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral. He was apprenticed to the Canterbury bookseller Edward Burges until 1730 when he set up his own business as a stationer and bookseller specialising in the second- hand and antiquarian book trade. He was in partnership with his brother John from 1738 and later traded in partnership with two of his former apprentices, first as Flackton and Marrable from 1774 and as Flackton, Marrable and Claris from 1784.

Peter Isaac and Barry McKay (Winchester; Delaware: 2000) pp. 121-130. In 1770, he published his Six Solos, Three for a Violoncello and Three for a Tenor,A common term for the viola in eighteenth century England was 'tenor' or 'tenor violin'. Accompanied Either with a Violoncello or Harpsichord, dedicated to Sir William Young, Lieutenant-Governor of Dominica. In the Preface, Flackton shows that he wanted to promote music for the viola. Flackton was the organist at the church of St Mary of Charity in Faversham between 1735 and 1752. He had a particular interest in church music which is demonstrated by his collection of music manuscripts, now held in the British Library. One of the more significant of Flackton's church compositions is Hymns for Three Voices which was composed in support of the Sunday school movement. Non-church music composed by Flackton includes A Glorious Chase in F major for three voices and horn, which he composed for the Canterbury Catch Club. Some of his works are used as examination pieces by many music schools. Bibliography *Sarah Gray, \\"Flackton, William (bap. 1709, d. 1798)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ed. H. C.

It took place when one of the wooden vats of fermenting porter burst. The pressure of the escaping liquid dislodged the valve of another vessel and destroyed several large barrels: between 128,000 and 323,000 imperial gallons (580,000‚Äì1,470,000 l; 154,000‚Äì388,000 US gal) of beer were released in total. The resulting wave of porter destroyed the back wall of the brewery and swept into an area of slum-dwellings known as the St Giles rookery. Eight people were killed, five of them mourners at the wake being held by an Irish family for a two-year-old boy. The coroner's inquest returned a verdict that the eight had lost their lives \\"casually, accidentally and by misfortune\\". The brewery was nearly bankrupted by the event; it avoided collapse after a rebate from HM Excise on the lost beer. The brewing industry gradually stopped using large wooden vats after the accident. The brewery moved in 1921, and the Dominion Theatre is now where the brewery used to stand. Meux & Co went into liquidation in 1961. Background In the early nineteenth century the Meux Brewery was one of the two largest in London, along with Whitbread. In 1809 Sir Henry Meux purchased the Horse Shoe Brewery, at the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. Meux's father, Sir Richard Meux, had previously co-owned the Griffin Brewery in Liquor-Pond Street (now Clerkenwell Road), in which he had constructed the largest vat in London, capable of holding 20,000 imperial barrels. \\"A Scene in St Giles's\\" ‚Äì the St Giles rookery, c. 1850 Henry Meux emulated his father's large vat, and constructed a wooden vessel tall and capable of holding 18,000 imperial barrels. of iron hoops were used to strengthen the vat. Meux brewed only porter, a dark beer that was first brewed in London and was the most popular alcoholic drink in the capital. Meux & Co brewed 102,493 imperial barrels in the twelve months up to July 1812. Porter was left in the large vessels to mature for several months, or up to a year for the best quality versions. At the rear of the Horse Shoe Brewery ran New Street, a small cul-de-sac that joined on to Dyott Street; this was within the St Giles rookery. The rookery, which covered an area of , \\"was a perpetually decaying slum seemingly always on the verge of social and economic collapse\\", according to Richard Kirkland, the professor of Irish literature. Thomas Beames, the preacher of Westminster St James, and author of the 1852 work The Rookeries of London: Past, Present and Prospective, described the St Giles rookery as \\"a rendezvous of the scum of society\\"; the area had been the inspiration for William Hogarth's 1751 print Gin Lane. 17 October 1814 At around 4:30 in the afternoon of 17 October 1814, George Crick, Meux's storehouse clerk, saw that one of the iron bands around a vat had slipped. The tall vessel was filled to within of the top with 3,555 imperial barrels of ten-month-old porter, weighing approximately . As bands slipped off the vats two or three times a year, Crick was unconcerned. He told his supervisor about the problem, but was told \\"that no harm whatever would ensue\\". Crick was told to write a note to Mr Young, one of the partners of the brewery, to have it fixed later. An hour after the hoop fell off, Crick was standing on a platform from the vat, holding the note to Mr Young, when the vessel, with no indication, burst. The force of the liquid's release knocked the stopcock from a neighbouring vat, which also began discharging its contents; several hogsheads of porter were destroyed, and their contents added to the flood. Between 128,000 and 323,000 imperial gallons were released. The force of the liquid destroyed the rear wall of the brewery; it was high and two and a half bricks thick. Some of the bricks from the back wall were knocked upwards, and fell onto the roofs of the houses in the nearby Great Russell Street. A wave of porter some high swept into New Street, where it destroyed two houses and badly damaged two others. In one of the houses a four-year-old girl, Hannah Bamfield, was having tea with her mother and another child. The wave of beer swept the mother and the second child into the street; Hannah was killed. In the second destroyed house, a wake was being held by an Irish family for a two-year-old boy; Anne Saville, the boy's mother, and four other mourners (Mary Mulvey and her three-year-old son, Elizabeth Smith and Catherine Butler) were killed. Eleanor Cooper, a 14-year-old servant of the publican of the Tavistock Arms in Great Russell Street, died when she was buried under the brewery's collapsed wall while washing pots in the pub's yard. Another child, Sarah Bates, was found dead in another house in New Street. The land around the building was low-lying and flat. With insufficient drainage, the beer flowed into cellars, many of which were inhabited, and people were forced to climb on furniture to avoid drowning. All those in the brewery survived, although three workmen had to be rescued from the rubble; the superintendent and one of the workers were taken to Middlesex Hospital, along with three others. 17 to 19 October Stories later arose of hundreds of people collecting the beer, mass drunkenness and a death from alcohol poisoning a few days later. The brewing historian Martyn Cornell states that newspapers of the time made no reference to the revelry, or of the later death; instead, the newspapers reported that the crowds were well behaved. Cornell points out that the popular press of the time did not like the immigrant Irish population that lived in St Giles, so if there had been any misbehaviour, it would have been reported. The area surrounding the rear of the brewery showed a \\"scene of desolation [that] presents a most awful and terrific appearance, equal to that which fire or earthquake may be supposed to occasion\\". Watchmen at the brewery charged people to view the remains of the destroyed beer vats, and several hundred spectators came to view the scene. The mourners killed in the cellar were given their own wake at The Ship public house in Bainbridge Street. The other bodies were laid out in a nearby yard by their families; the public came to see them and donated money for their funerals. Collections were taken up more widely for the families. Coroner's inquest The coroner's inquest was held at the Workhouse of the St Giles parish on 19 October 1814; George Hodgson, the coroner for Middlesex, oversaw proceedings. The details of the victims were read out as: *Eleanor Cooper, age 14 *Mary Mulvey, age 30 *Thomas Murry, age 3 (Mary Mulvey's son) *Hannah Bamfield, age 4 years 4 months *Sarah Bates, age 3 years 5 months *Ann Saville, age 60 *Elizabeth Smith, age 27 *Catherine Butler, age 65. Hodgson took the jurors to the scene of the events, and they viewed the brewery and bodies before evidence was taken from witnesses. The first witness was George Crick, who had seen the event happen in full; his brother was one of the men who had been injured at the brewery. Crick said that hoops on the vats failed three or four times a year, but without any previous problems. Accounts were also heard from Richard Hawse‚Äîthe landlord of the Tavistock Arms, whose barmaid had been killed in the accident‚Äîand several others. The jury returned a verdict that the eight had lost their lives \\"casually, accidentally and by misfortune\\". Later As the coroner's inquest reached a verdict of an act of God, Meux & Co did not have to pay compensation. The disaster‚Äîthe lost porter, the damage to the buildings and the replacement of the vat‚Äîcost the company ¬£23,000. After a private petition to Parliament they recovered about ¬£7,250 from HM Excise, saving them from bankruptcy. The Horseshoe Brewery went back into business soon afterwards, but closed in 1921 when Meux moved their production to the Nine Elms brewery in Wandsworth, which they had purchased in 1914. At the time of its closure, the site covered . The brewery was demolished the following year and the Dominion Theatre was later built on the site. Meux & Co went into liquidation in 1961. As a result of the accident, large wooden tanks were phased out across the brewing industry and replaced with lined concrete vessels.

Overview The system was originally conceived as building blocks for solid-state hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of programmable logic controllers (PLC)) to replace electro- mechanical relay logic in industrial control systems for process control and automation applications, similar to early Telefunken/AEG Logistat, Siemens Simatic, BBC Sigmatronic, ACEC Logacec or Estacord systems. Each available logical function was recognizable by the color of its plastic container, black, blue, red, green, violet, etc. The most important circuit block contained a NOR gate (hence the name), but there were also blocks containing drivers, and a timer circuit similar to the later 555 timer IC. The original Norbit modules of the YL 6000 series introduced in 1960 had potted single in- line packages with up to ten long flying leads arranged in two groups of up to five leads in a row. These modules were specified for frequencies of less than 1 kHz at ¬±24 V supply. Also available in 1960 were so called Combi-Element modules in single-in line packages with ten evenly spaced stiff leads in a row (5.08 mm / 0.2-inch pitch) for mounting on a PCB. They were grouped in the 1-series (aka \\"100 kHz series\\") with ¬±6 V supply. The newer 10-series and 20-series had similarly sized packages, but came with an additional parallel row of nine staggered leads for a total of 19 leads. The 10-series uses germanium alloy transistors, whereas in the 20-series silicon planar transistors are used for a higher cut-off frequency of up to 1 MHz (vs. 30 kHz) and a higher allowed temperature range of +85 ¬∞C (vs. +55 ¬∞C). In 1967, the Philips/Mullard NORBIT 2 aka Valvo NORBIT-S family of modules was introduced, first consisting of the 60-series for frequencies up to 10 kHz at a single supply voltage of 24 V, only. Later, the 61-series, containing thyristor trigger and control modules, was added. A 90-series became available in the mid-1970s as well. There were three basic types contained in a large (one by two inch-sized) 17 pins dual in-line package, with nine pins spaced 5.08 mm (0.2-inch) on one side and eight staggered pins on the other side.

Vernon was established on 26 April 1876 as the Royal Navy's Torpedo Branch also known as the Torpedo School, named after the ship HMS Vernon which served as part of its floating base. After the First World War, HMS Vernon moved ashore, taking over the Gunwharf site, where it continued to operate until 1 April 1996, when the various elements comprising the establishment were split up and moved to different commands. Foundation and early history The second ship to be called HMS Vernon ended her career laid up in Chatham Dockyard as a floating coaling jetty. In 1872 she was moved to become a tender to HMS Excellent for torpedo and mining training. In 1874 she was joined by HMS Vesuvius, an iron screw torpedo vessel. Vesuvius was attached as an Experimental Tender for the conduct of torpedo trials, and remained in the role until 1923. On 26 April 1876 Vernon was joined by the former steam frigate HMS Ariadne and the lighter Florence Nightingale. These were then commissioned as HMS Vernon, and became the home of the Royal Navy's Torpedo Branch, independent of HMS Excellent. Ariadne was used to provide accommodation. In January 1886 HMS Donegal replaced the original Vernon as a more spacious torpedo school ship. Donegal was renamed Vernon, the original Vernon was renamed Actaeon and took over as the practical workshop. On 23 April 1895 the hulks were moved to Portchester Creek. Ariadne was replaced as an accommodation hulk by the old HMS Marlborough, which was renamed Vernon II and was connected by bridges to Actaeon and Vernon, jointly named Vernon I. In 1904 HMS Warrior joined the establishment as a floating workshop, power plant and wireless telegraphy school, renamed Vernon III. Meanwhile, Actaeon was renamed Vernon IV. Also in 1904 Ariadne was detached and sent to Sheerness to be used to establish a new torpedo school. She was renamed Actaeon in 1905. In wartime and onshore Wrens in HMS Vernon, assembling the secret firing units of ground mines used in special operations to foil German minesweeping operations On the outbreak of the First World War Vernon was used to carry out torpedo trials and to train new recruits for the Navy. Extensive research and development was also carried to develop new anti-submarine devices, mines and ships' electrics. On 1 October 1923 Vernon was moved ashore and new departments were set up to cover aspects of maritime warfare, such as mining, torpedoes and electrical equipment. The names of the original hulks that made up the floating Vernon were used for buildings in the base. Their Chief Scientist from the beginning (probably coming from off-shore research) was Prof Edward Philip Harrison FRSE, who remained in charge until 1937. doing much to progress the advancement of magnetic mines. In the Second World War, and following on from the increasing use of mines, Vernon took on responsibility for mine disposal and developing mine countermeasures. The staff were able to capture a number of enemy mines and develop successful countermeasures. A number of officers working with Vernon were awarded Distinguished Service Orders for their successes in capturing new types of mine. The Germans began placing booby traps in some mines to counter attempts by Vernon's staff to capture them. One exploded in a mining shed at Vernon on 6 August 1940, killing an officer and four ratings and seriously injuring a number of other personnel. To avoid a repetition of this, a nearby disused quarry, nicknamed HMS Mirtle (short for Mine Investigation Range), was used for examining mines. Portsmouth suffered heavy air raids during the war, with Vernon being hit several times. One bomb demolished Dido Building and killed 100 people. Subsequently, sections of Vernon were dispersed to quieter areas. On 3 May 1941 most departments of Vernon were moved to Roedean School at Brighton, which was known as HMS Vernon(R), whilst other elements were relocated elsewhere on the south coast and further away. On 1 October 1944 responsibility for naval diving passed from the Gunnery Branch, at HMS Excellent, to the Torpedo Branch, at Vernon. A new diving school known as Vernon(D) was established at Brixham on 27 October 1944, with administrative support in Dartmouth. The Brixham base was later joined by the Admiralty Experimental Diving Unit (AEDU) and the Deep Diving Tender HMS Tedworth. The unit remained at Brixham until 1 October 1945 when it returned to the main HMS Vernon at Portsmouth. Postwar devolution and decommissioning Old HMS Vernon figurehead, preserved at Gunwharf Quays On 10 October 1946 the recently formed Electrical Branch took over responsibility for Electrical Operations from Vernon, whilst Vernon merged with the Anti-Submarine Branch, which had been based at HMS Osprey at Portland. The merger resulted in the formation of the Torpedo and Anti-Submarine (TAS) Branch, which assumed responsibility for naval diving. The TAS Branch remained at Vernon until mid 1974, when it was moved to become part of HMS Dryad prior to the formation of the Operations Branch the following year. Vernon housed the RN Diving School, training Clearance Divers for the Fleet Clearance diving teams and minehunters. The establishment was also the home of the \\"Dunker\\" Helicopter and Fixed Wing Aircraft Escape Training, until a new facility was opened at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron). Vernon ceased to be an independent command on 31 March 1986, when it was renamed HMS Nelson (Vernon Site), and in 1987 it was renamed HMS Nelson (Gunwharf) It became the Headquarters for the Commandant General Royal Marines for a brief period, and continued to be used for training. Mine warfare training was moved to the School of Maritime Operations (SMOPS), now part of HMS Dryad, in November 1995. The final element of the old Vernon, the diving school, was moved onto new premises on Horsea Island and Vernon ceased to exist. The figurehead of the original HMS Vernon is preserved in Portsmouth.

C. Southworth, was a prominent American radio engineer best known for his role in the development of waveguides in the early 1930s. Biography Southworth was born in Little Cooley, Pennsylvania, graduated in 1914 with a physics degree from Grove City College, and studied one year at Columbia University. In June 1917 he joined the National Bureau of Standards, then in 1918 moved to Yale University to teach in a Signal Corps school. He remained at Yale to complete a doctorate in 1923 on the measurement of the dielectric constant of water at frequencies above 15 MHz. Southworth left Yale for a position with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, where he first helped edit the Bell System Technical Journal, but then switched to researching shortwave radio propagation. In 1931 he began to study wave propagation in dielectric rods, by early 1932 observed wave propagation in a water-filled copper pipe, and by May 1933 transmitted waves through air-filled copper pipes up to 20 feet in length. (He later recalled that the first message sent through a waveguide was \\"Send money.\\") After he constructed a 5-in.-diameter waveguide with a length of 875 feet, the project was moved to the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his career until retirement in 1955.

It is often referred to as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting. Account stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV hacking and piracy but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect. A contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like cable-TV, and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis. \\\\---- CRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations In Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the CRTC as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations. 1\\\\. Under the regulations a \\"customer\\" means a person who is liable for payment for programming services that are distributed by a licensee and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. 2\\\\. A \\"subscriber\\" is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee. 3\\\\. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit wire-line service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for distribution cover a continent-wide area. 4\\\\. The CRTC broadcast distribution regulations seem to favour the 'per customer' model and sanction \\"account stacking\\". 5\\\\. The CRTC has a policy in place to accommodate the marketing and billing practice of ‚Äúaccount stacking‚Äù under its Broadcast Distribution Regulations. This is discussed in Broadcast Public Notices 2006-133 and 2006-134, which provides that ‚Äòdiscretionary service' channel providers are to be paid a wholesale affiliation fee on a ‚Äòper dwelling‚Äô basis. Basic service channel providers do not receive affiliation fees and so are not affected by this \\"Account Stacking\\" policy. \\\\---- Radiocommunication Act (Canada) 9\\\\.

It is located on the Luvuvhu River near the villages of ha-Mutoti and ha-Budeli and ha-Mphego just a few kilometres from Thohoyandou in the district of Vhembe. The dam serves primarily for water supply and its hazard potential has been ranked high (3). The Luvuvhu river follows a course along the southern edge of the Zoutpansberg and eventually joins the Limpopo River in the far northern corner of the Kruger National Park on the border between South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Serious droughts during the early 1990s, when numerous boreholes in Venda and Gazankulu failed and consequently drinking water had to be delivered by tankers, led the Department of Water Affairs to investigate the feasibility of providing a steady water supply to the region. The Nandoni Dam supplies water to several places in the region. Fishing in the dam attracts tourists, the main species being fished for are Largemouth bass and kurper. The estimated cost of the Nandoni Dam was R373,3 million. Communities living in the basin of the dam were directly affected by the scheme. The inhabitants of Budeli, Mulenzhe, Tshiulongoma and Dididi have relocated to new houses built by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The relocation applied to approximately 400 families. Nandoni Dam consist of various places for fishing competitions, camping and lodging. The most popular fishing and lodging places are Nandoni Villa and Nandoni Fish Eagle.

The Castle of Miranda de Ebro is a mediaeval fortification located in Miranda de Ebro, Spain. Location The castle of Miranda de Ebro is located on Picota hill, in the heart of the old helmet of the city. It is positioned about 500 metres above sea level and offers great views of the city and the mountains that surround it. History Plan of the castle of Miranda de Ebro in 1844 The origins of the castle of Miranda de Ebro date from 15 October 1358, when Tello of Castille asked the bishopric of Calahorra for the land to construct a castle at the top of the hill of La Picota, a place that was at that time occupied by the church of Santa Maria. Nevertheless, the construction did not begin until 1449, when Pedro Sarmiento occupied the church. Construction was delayed until 1485 and were directed by the expert stonecutter Juan Guas. The fact that Miranda has been always a border region has caused the castle to witness the consequences of war on numerous occasions, and was continuously redeveloped. The most recent conflict it saw was during the War of Independence of Spain and the Carlist Wars, that left the castle in ruins. Perhaps the most important event of the fortress's history occurred during the War of Spanish Independence, when Jose Bonaparte signed the decree of use of the French currency in Spain at the castle. In 1903, the city council, which was at the time the owner of the castle, decided to dismantle it. The stone from the castle was used for the construction of the bullring (today disappeared), the ruins of the castle were covered with earth and used as the foundations for the construction of a water tank. The castle is protected under the generic Declaration of the Decree of 22 of April 1949, and Law 16/1985 on Spanish Historical Patrimony. The value and use of the castle is currently under assessment.Noticia sobre el Plan Director de rehabiliaci√≥n Description The castle plan had trapezoidal form, with four or five vertices. Today only the north wall is visible, between the King's Battery and the Queen's Battery. Also preserved, though hidden by vegetation, is the East-West wall and a circular tower in the southwestern edge, which was probably crenellated. The entrance to the fortification was through a barbican: a small defensive system that consisted of a series of entrance halls before the front door. It also had a pit on the west side that looks towards the rest of the hill of the Picota. The castle was constructed of ashlar masonry stone, or at least the external walls, while the rest was completed with rubble.

The diocese was established after the reforms of Diocletian, and its vicarius, headquartered at Amaseia, was subordinate to the Praetorian prefecture of the East. Its military forces, facing the Sassanid threat, were commanded by the dux Ponti et Armeniae until the middle of the 5th century, and by two separate duces afterwards, until Justinian I instituted a new magister militum per Armeniam for the Armenian frontier. Justinian's reforms also abolished the diocese in 535, and its vicar was made into the governor of Galatia I. The results however were not satisfactory, and the diocese was reestablished in 548, continuing to function until replaced by the themata of Armeniakon and Opsikion in the later 7th century. On the north east shore of the Black Sea, the cities Nitike, Pitiyus, and Dioscurias were part of the diocese until the 7th century. The diocese included 12 provinces: Bithynia, Honorias, Paphlagonia, Helenopontus, Pontus Polemoniacus, Galatia I and Galatia II (Salutaris), Cappadocia I and Cappadocia II, Armenia I, Armenia II, Armenia Maior and the autonomous Armenian principalities (Satrapiae) in the area of Sophene.

The film tells the true story of Richard Pimentel, a respected public speaker whose hearing disability attained in the Vietnam War drove him to become an activist for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plot In 1970s Portland, Oregon, Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston) realizes he has a remarkable gift for public speaking. Pimentel's idol is College Bowl founder Dr. Padrow (Hector Elizondo), but upon trying out for Dr. Padrow, the ambitious young speaker is informed that he won't have anything to talk about until he has lived a full life. Realizing that there is some merit to Dr. Padrow's observation, Pimentel subsequently enlists in the military and prepares for duty in Vietnam. Later, while fighting on the battlefield, Pimentel loses most of his hearing and is left with permanent tinnitus. He returns home frustrated, and enrolls at Portland State University. When others inform him that he will never achieve his dreams because he is deaf, the determined veteran makes it his mission to prove them wrong. But it is not as much about changing others' perceptions of persons with disabilities as it is about altering their perceptions of themselves, and with a little help from foul-mouthed genius Art Honeyman (Michael Sheen) (who has cerebral palsy), free-spirited beauty Christine (Melissa George), and mercurial, hard-drinking veteran Mike Stoltz (Yul V√°zquez), Pimentel plays a pivotal role in creating the Americans With Disabilities Act.

Critical response Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter noted: \\"Music Within will hook the audience up with a supremely cool and witty real-life character, Richard Pimentel...what should be a tough, sentimental slog whisks by in a breezy, entertaining 94 minutes like a kind of illustrated stand-up comedy routine.\\" Matt Seitz of The New York Times, however, called the film's direction \\"annoyingly unimaginative,\\" ultimately deeming it \\"a bad movie with a good heart.\\" Reviewing the film for Slant Magazine, Nick Schager awarded it two out of four stars, noting: \\"Livingston, a consistently appealing presence who exudes unpretentious everyman charm, successfully sells even the corniest of scenarios‚Äîthe most groan-worthy of which is a discriminatory pancake house offense that, per uplifting melodramatic requirements‚Äîis rectified 20 years later with some heartwarming syrup.\\" Roger Ebert called the film \\"entertaining\\" and \\"sometimes inspiring,\\" but added: \\"What bothers me is that Music Within takes an individual story, an inspiring one, yes, and then thinks that's all there is to be told. It wasn't one guy who got mad. It was decades of struggle, decades of rejection, decades of streets that couldn't be crossed, stairs that couldn't be climbed, houses that couldn't be lived in and customers who couldn't be bothered.\\" Awards Movie director Steven Sawalich won an Audience Award at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival for best narrative feature film.

Only a single unit was built; this vehicle is displayed at the US Army Ordnance Museum, Aberdeen, Maryland.  History  The Italian Army was not far behind the Germans in realizing the need for assault guns and developed a string of vehicles that outwardly resembled the StuG III. These Italian assault guns were produced in appreciable numbers for they were better armoured and quicker to produce than the contemporary Italian tanks. But by the time significant numbers had been issued, Italy was effectively out of the war, and most of these guns fell into German hands. The majority of these semoventi were armed with 75 mm and 105 mm guns and howitzers, but were mostly direct fire weapons. The Italian artillery arm still needed self-propelled artillery weapons to support the armoured formations. Ansaldo therefore diverted some of its development facilities to design a powerful artillery weapon that could be carried on a tracked chassis. In the end, Ansaldo settled on an existing weapon, the Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 and placed it on a much modified Carro Armato M15/42 tank chassis. The selection of these two pieces of equipment was made in order to produce as good a carriage/weapon combination as possible. The snag however was that the Italian army was already crying out for large numbers of both the gun and tank and Italian industry could not keep up with the demand. This new weapon, the Semovente da 149/40 got off to a shaky start. The Semovente da 149/40 was a completely unprotected weapon as the long gun barrel was placed on an open mounting carried on the turretless tank chassis. The gun crew stood in the open to serve the gun that had its trunnions mounted right to the rear to absorb some of the recoil forces produced on firing. It was late 1942 before the first prototype was ready for prolonged firing trials, but even before these were over unsuccessful attempts were being made to start production. Before the lines could start rolling the Italians surrendered to the Allies and the Germans took over what was left of the Italian economy. Thus the Semovente da 149/40 prototype remained the sole example of what seemed to be a promising design. The Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 could fire a shell to a range of , at which distance the lack of protection for the gun crew would have been of relatively little importance.

Life De Visdelou was born at the Ch√¢teau de Bienassis, Erquy, Brittany. He entered the Society of Jesus on 5 September 1673, and was one of the missionaries sent to China by Louis XIVin 1687. He acquired a wide knowledge of the Chinese language and literature. Other learned Jesuits considered that he gave too much credit to modern Chinese commentators, who being atheists and materialists read their own ideas into the ancient Chinese sages. When the papal legate Mgr. de Tournon came to China in 1705, chiefly to regulate the question of the Chinese Rites, Visdelou was the only Jesuit favourable to their prohibition. Tournon appointed him Vicar Apostolic of Kwei-chou with the title of bishop of Claudiopolis in Isauria, but his superiors opposed the nomination, since Visdelou had not received papal dispensation from his vow not to accept ecclesiastical dignity. With the missionaries who had submitted to the decree against the rites, Visdelou followed the legate to Macau, where he was secretly consecrated bishop, 2 February 1709. He then set out for Pondicherry where he arrived, 25 June 1709; he remained there in great retirement in the house of the French Capuchins until his death at Pondicherry. Works Visdelou took with him over 500 volumes in Chinese and almost his sole occupation consisted in working on these. He sent to Rome several writings on the questions of the rites. The Sinologist, James Legge, says he \\"was in the habit of writing extravagantly about the Chinese and caricaturing their sentiments\\" (\\"Notions of the Chinese concerning God and the spirit\\", Hong Kong, 1852, 10). His most trustworthy works deal with the history of the Tartars. He collected from Chinese historians unique documents on the peoples of Central Asia and Eastern Asia: Huns, Tatars, Mongols, and Turks. His researches on this subject were first published as supplement to Herbelot's Biblioth√®que orientale (1779). However, they must have assisted Joseph de Guignes in his history of the Huns, for the geographer Anville who had handled all Visdelou's valuable manuscript on the Tatars tells us that the author had sent them to the Academician Jean-Roland Malet, who died in 1736 (Memoire de M. d'Anville sur la Chine, 1776, 33).

It was the brainchild of Daily Mail newspaper proprietor the late Viscount Rothermere. Vere Rothermere had a great love of dogs and believed Britain needed a magazine for pet lovers. The magazine is headquartered in Chobham, Surrey. History and profile Beverley Cuddy was appointed the launch editor. She had previously worked on many other dog titles and had been the Kennel Club's Information Officer, but this was her first editorship. She is also the publisher of the magazine, which is published on a monthly basis. Few at the Daily Mail shared Rothermere's vision and the launch was erratically supported internally. After some very expensive TV advertising the decision was taken to close the title and make all the staff redundant. Cuddy believed in the title's potential and organised a management buyout. Lord Rothermere was amused and quite touched by this as Cuddy had no publishing experience. He sold the title to her for ¬£1 and came in as a minor investor. He later confided that he thought she was highly unlikely to succeed where the might of Associated Newspaper's had failed. A year later, however, at the PPA awards, Dogs Today's new publisher Pet Subjects Limited took the Small Publisher of the Year Award. Rothermere was delighted and sent over his chauffeur with champagne to celebrate. Dogs Today was short-listed for many other editing and publishing awards including the prestigious 'best dog magazine in the world award\\". The magazine was always a campaigning publication and it was key in the reform of the Dangerous Dogs Act and also the banning of tail docking - the magazine was cited by the Government committee that reviewed the subject. The magazine is also active in campaigning for the improvement of the health of pedigree dogs and has compiled a comprehensive listing of all the hereditary health tests that should be performed for each breed before a litter is bred.

Around 1826‚Äì1828, he and Abbas Mirza, the crown prince, attempted to win back the Transcaucasian and Dagestanian possessions lost to Russia during the war of 1804-1813 which had ended with the Gulistan Treaty. However, using superior tactics and weapons developed since their defeat of Napoleon, the Tsar‚Äôs generals inflicted even greater losses on Iran. Map of the Erivan Khanate and its surroundings. In addition to ceding further territories, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay forced Iran to pay crippling reparations. The treaty also banned Hossein Khan and his younger brother, Hasan Khan, from ever venturing north of the Aras River, the new border. Hossein Khan belonged to the Qoyunlu branch of the Qajar clan, and was thus part of the royal Qajar dynasty. He was the son of Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had served as the governor of Erivan in the late 18th-century. Furthermore, Hossein Khan was a confidant of Fath Ali Shah, who had cemented their relationship by marrying his sister and giving one of his daughters, Shirin Jan Khanom, in marriage to Hossein Khan's son, Mohammad Qoli Khan. According to foreign writers who visited Iran, Hossein Khan was one of the most influential and wealthy leaders in Iran with as much power as Abbas Mirza. Hossein Khan Khan did not have any members of his family as prisoners in Tehran, had the privilege to issue coins, and had the infrequent favorable circumstance of maintaining an extensive part of the income for defense intentions. He inspired commerce and established a steady government. Indeed, Armenian and Russian sources, who rarely have anything positive to assert about the Iranian khans in Transcaucasia, praise Hossein Khan for being generous, truthful, grand, diligent, and fair. The Shah had been indebted to Hossein Khan ever since, on the death of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, Hossein Khan led an advance column of troops to Tehran to secure the capital and the throne for Fath Ali. Later, the Shah dispatched him to quell a rebellion in Khorasan province. In return for his loyalty, Hossein Khan was rewarded with the Khanate of Erevan, which he ruled until the last Russo-Persian War (1826-1828). Hossein Khan was also granted estates encompassing some 62 villages near the city of Qazvin. Later generations of Sardars bequeathed their inheritance to religious endowments, or vaqf. The ab anbar sardar, a cavernous underground water reservoir in Qazvin, was named after Hossein Khan. Local legend has it that, at 3,000 cubic meters and 28.5 meters from base to ceiling, it took seven months to fill and its supply of water lasted for seven years. Fed by three qanats (subterranean water canals), it is the largest in Iran. Unlike other Transcaucasian khans, Hossein Khan did not make an agreement with the Russians and accomplished to hinder their attempts for two decades. Russia‚Äôs irritation was displayed in article 14 of the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), which particularly removed him and his brother of the privilege to sell or trade their estates in Erevan, a privilege which was allowed to all others.

At 18.5 tonnes, 5m length, it was designed as an airborne/airdropped replacement for the 5.1 tonnes heavier M41 Walker Bulldog. The T92 was never accepted into service. The main gun was a conventional 76 mm cannon with a very low profile turret. Little more was exposed than the main gun and two crew cupolas which allowed 50 caliber and 30 caliber machine guns to fire buttoned up. The engine was moved to the front, which increased protection for the crew, and a rear access door provided an escape hatch and allowed for reloading under cover; this layout was later adopted by the Israeli Merkava battle tank. It had a crew of four with a semi- automatic loading system that allowed it to shoot 12 rounds a minute. It carried 60 main gun rounds, and automatically ejected spent shell casings. Study of the Soviet PT-76 led to a new swimming requirement for light tanks, for which the design could not be modified. The T92 would be passed over and the M551 Sheridan was eventually adopted instead. It fielded an unconventional 152 mm gun-missile system which would suffer many technical problems, and its swimming system would be rarely used in combat.

The type locality given is \\"Catumbella [Catumbela]\\" near Lobito, Angola. Habitats are rocky outcrops or areas strewn with rocks in open brush or grassland. Diurnal, they shelter in small caves, overhangs and crevices. Behaviour and biology Python anchietae exhibits similar temperament to its closest cousin, the ball python. It hisses, but this is mostly bluff. Diet consists of small mammals and birds. P. anchietae is oviparous, with small clutches of four to five eggs being produced at a time. It is not known whether the females \\"incubate\\" their eggs as is typical for the members of this family. Hatchlings are 43‚Äì46 cm (17-18 inches) in length.

The area has mostly loose reddish lateritic low fertility soil. In the east, the flood plains of the major rivers, such as the Ajay, Bakreshwar, Mayurakshi and Brahmani, have soft alluvial soil. The forest cover is only 3.5% of the total district. Although coal is found in the district and Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station has a capacity of 2,010 MW, the economic condition of Birbhum is dominated by agriculture. From 1977 onwards majorland reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. In Birbhum district, 19,968 hectares of vested agricultural land has been distributed amongst 161,515 beneficiaries, till 2011. However, more than 38% of the operational land holding is marginal or less than 1 acre. The proportion of agricultural labourers amongst total workers in Birbhum district is 45.9%, the highest amongst all districts of West Bengal.

Working in a style, which combined his Flemish roots with the profound influence of Italian art, he was known for his portraits and altarpieces.Gash, John; Montagu, Jennifer, Algardi, Gentile and Innocent X: A Rediscovered Painting and Its Frame, in: The Burlington Magazine, 1980, pp. 55‚Äì56 Life His birthplace was probably the village Breivelde near Ninove in present-day Belgium but it is also possible that he was born in Brussels.Biographical data on Hadrian A birth before 1606 is also considered possible. He was apprenticed to Gillis Claeissins the younger in Brussels in 1617.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He left the southern Netherlands while still young.Carl Van de Velde. \\"Primo, Luigi.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 18 January 2017 According to the 17th-century biographer Joachim von Sandrart Cousin continued his studies in Paris.Ludovicus Primo in: Joachim von Sandrart, Teutsche Academie der Bau-, Bild- und Mahlerey-K√ºnste, N√ºrnberg 1675/1679/1680 The four Doctors of the Church, Royal Palace of Madrid He was in Rome as early as 1626. Here he would remain for thirty years. He joined the Bentvueghels, the informal association of mainly Dutch and Flemish painters resident in Rome. In the Bentvueghels he was given the nickname Gentile or Gentiel on account of his gentle manners. He was in Rome commonly known by his nickname Gentile. He used also in Italy the surname 'Primo' which is a translation into Italian of his surname which in French means 'cousin'. In Rome he studied the works of the great masters.Luigi Gentile in: Giovanni Battista Passeri, Vite de pittori, scultori ed architetti che anno lavorato in Roma, Roma, 1772, blz. 249-253] The first work in Rome that brought him some fame was a fresco on the side altar of the Santi Domenico e Sisto church in Rome. It depicts a miracle attributed to Dominic Guzman. Then he painted one of four oil paintings in the Saint Catherine chapel in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. This work increased his reputation and earned him new, well- paid commissions. In 1635 he joined the confraternity of the Church of St. Julian of the Flemings, signing with 'Ludovicus Cousin, alias Primo, alias Gentile'. He was further inducted into the Accademia di San Luca in 1650 and even became its director from 1651 to 1652. The admission criteria of the Accademia were very strict and considered both the artistic merit and personal qualities of the candidate. The selection process consisted of two rounds of voting in order to ensure that only the most eminent artists were selected and the prestige of the Accademia would be preserved.Memorie per servire alla storia della Romana Accademia di S. Luca Portrait of a Noblewoman of Ancona (1650-1660) The seventeenth-century Italian biographer Giovanni Battista Passeri wrote that Cousin's passion for women induced him to neglect his work and squander all his money. Cousin decided to leave Rome. He traveled to Loreto, where he made a painting for the high altar of the church of Santa Margherita, and then to Pesaro, where he worked in the cathedral. Finally he moved to Venice, where he painted several portraits. He returned to Rome a few years before the death of Pope Innocent X in 1655. He was the first artist who painted a portrait of his successor Alexander VII following his election. After spending more than thirty years in Rome, he returned to Brussels. He became a member of the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1661. He continued to paint portraits and historical themes, and also made designs (cartons) for tapestries that were then manufactured by local weavers. Through his involvement in the manufacture of tapestries, he was exempt from taxes. His work was popular with the Habsburg princes from whom he received numerous commissions. For the Spanish king he made a few cartons for tapestries and a large painting entitled Venus Lamenting the Death of Adonis (around 1656-1557).Venus Lamenting the Death of Adonis in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien He painted a number of paintings for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and made for the Austrian emperor some portraits of the emperor. According to Passeri he left little money after his death because he was fond of entertainment and thus liberally spent the money he earned. He had a number of students, including Jan van Cleef. Work Louis Cousin painted mythological subjects and religious works and was also very appreciated as a portrait painter. The style of Cousin is situated halfway between the Italian and Flemish traditions and is a typical example of the lofty, somewhat tediously decorative style of the High Baroque. Guillermo Ram√≥n Moncada visiting the King of Aragon possibly Charles Some of the altarpieces he painted between 1633 and 1657 for churches in Rome are still in situ (e.g. Virgin Presenting the Child to St Anthony of Padua, 1655, San Marco, Rome). According to some sources say Cousin painted between 1646-1652 27 small devotional paintings on copper for Pope Innocent X. The small panels that were greatly admired by his contemporaries are, however, lost.Biographical details in Italian Encyclopedia Treccani online He collaborated on a series of twenty copper panels that narrate the deeds of two Sicilian noble brothers of Spanish origin, Guillermo Ram√≥n Moncada and Antonio Moncada. Of twelve scenes devoted to the former, Luigi Primo painted five, Willem van Herp six and Adam Frans van der Meulen one.

Bureau of Foreign Commerce About 13 years earlier, in 1875, N.J. Ede had built a house named Dunheved on the property.Hong Kong Public Records Office In 1881, Alexander Findlay Smith, a Scottish former railway man, had petitioned for the right to introduce a funicular railway to Hong Kong. The Peak Tram was built and began operations in 1888. About the same time, Findlay Smith bought Dunheved from Ede, and opened it as the Peak Hotel. (Ede and his family moved next door.) After the Peak Tram opened, Findlay Smith quickly put the Peak Hotel on the market. It was sold, and completely rebuilt into an imposing three-story building, reopening in 1890. It boasted of commodious and well-appointed accommodation, and the hotel was deservedly popular. Later, another story was added to make it four stories, and then a two-story annexe with views down to Pok Fu Lam was built. A further addition doubled the size of the annexe and added a third story. The hotel commanded views of the city and the harbour in one direction, and of Pok Fu Lam facing Lamma Island in the other. In 1922 it was bought by the owners of the rival Hong Kong Hotel hshgroup.com for HK$ 600,000. The hotel's poor construction led to further deterioration.

He was later resident engineer during the building of the London and Birmingham Railway, and also designed Stockport Viaduct and the Dane Valley Viaduct on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. Early life Buck was born on 1 April 1789 at Stoke Holy Cross, near Norwich. His parents were Quakers and sent him, with his two brothers, to the Quaker School at Ackworth, West Yorkshire. With his schooling completed, his father placed him with a wholesaler at Tower Hill, London, as he wanted him to be involved in trade, but the position did not suit Buck, and so he looked for something else. Around 1807, the East London Waterworks Company were building Old Ford pumping station, which had been designed by Ralph Walker, and Buck managed to secure a job there. When the job was finished, Walker moved on to Farlington, to work on a water supply scheme for Portsmouth and Gosport. The scheme had been authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1809, and Buck went to work as resident engineer, reporting to Walker. The scheme suffered from an intermittent water supply, as did a competing scheme engineered by William Nicholson. Canal engineer Buck's next appointment was as engineer for the Eastern Branch of the Montgomeryshire Canal in 1819. The canal had been planned to run from the Ellesmere Canal at Carreghofa to Newtown, but construction had stopped at Garthmyl in 1797, due to a lack of funds. This section became known as the Eastern Branch. It had been built by John Dadford and his brother Thomas, both relatively inexperienced, but John had left for America before the project was completed, to be replaced by his father, also called Thomas Dadford. Construction of the rest of the line to Newtown, known as the Western Branch, and built by a company which was more or less independent, began in 1815, to the designs of Josias Jessop. The work was finished in 1819, although was not declared to be complete until December 1821. There had been problems with some of the structures on the Eastern Branch during construction, although Jessop, when asked to comment, had suggested that such problems were quite usual. However, by the time Buck took up his position, the problems were obvious, and he embarked on a programme of reconstruction. First on the list was the Luggy Aqueduct at Brithdir, which was rebuilt with a cast iron trough in the year he started. Next he introduced lock gates built of the same material, and also used it for replacing some of the bridge beams. The aqueduct over the River Vyrnwy had failed during construction, when an arch collapsed, and by 1823, the masonry was distorted and bulging. Again, iron was Buck's material of choice, for he used wrought iron tie rods connected to cast iron facing plates to hold the structure together, with cast iron beams on the faces of the arches. Several of the aqueducts were also fitted with cast iron railings. In 1821 he designed the waterwheel used to pump water from the River Severn at Newtown to the top pound of the Western Branch, and introduced the distinctive lock paddle gear to the Eastern Branch in 1831. In December 1832 he was appointed engineer of the Western Branch as well, but moved on a year later. Railway engineer In December 1833 Buck left canal employment to join Robert Stephenson's team building the London and Birmingham Railway. He already had some knowledge of railways, having visited the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1828, and witnessed the Rainhill Trials in the following year. He was employed as a senior assistant engineer, and his salary reflected his obvious ability and experience. He had responsibility for the line from Camden Town to Tring, and was offered the post of resident engineer for the railway after the construction project was completed in 1837, but was not happy with the conditions, and moved on work on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway as Engineer-in-Chief. Among his achievements on that project were the Stockport and Dane viaducts. He travelled to Germany in 1840, to work on the Altona‚ÄîKiel Railroad, but he became ill and returned to England earlier than expected. Legacy In 1839 he published a work entitled A Practical and Theoretical Essay on Oblique Bridges in which he was the first to apply trigonometry to the design of the skew arch railway bridge. It was used as a standard reference work on the subject until the early 20th century, its last reprinting being in 1895. He was an active member of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1821. He was extremely busy during the railway mania years, but his health broke and he became deaf in the mid-1840s, retiring to the Isle of Man. He lived at Ramsey, and spent his time studying the Scriptures. He remained a close friend of Robert Stephenson, who supported him throughout. He died of scarlatina on 9 March 1854 and was buried at Maughold. His wife and a daughter died of the same disease within a fortnight. Today a boat is named after him, which operates from Llanymynech Wharf on the Montgomery Canal.

It opened on Queen's Road and Pedder Street in 1868, later expanding into the Victoria Harbour waterfront of Victoria City in 1893. History The original hotel stood roughly on the site of the present Central Building at Queen's Road Central and Pedder Street. It was owned by The Hongkong Hotel Company, which later became The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited, current owner of The Peninsula Hotels chain. In the late 1880s the six-storey north wing extension was built on the waterfront, with entrances on Pedder Street, Queen's Road and Praya Central (now Des Voeux Road Central). Competing in all respects with the Peak Hotel, owned by The Star Ferry Company, the management provided a special launch to meet arriving passengers on incoming P&O; mail steamers and ferry them direct to the hotel's pier. A shop of Kuhn & Komor was located on the ground floor of the hotel, along Queen's Road. After the north wing burned down in 1929, the original part of the hotel, especially the large Gripps Restaurant, continued to be popular with the public, but the hotel eventually closed in 1952. The hotel building was bought by the owner of the 1949 Hong Kong Derby Champion and lead investor of a company which was later renamed Central Development Limited. Extensive renovation was done, but the part which once housed the popular Gripps Restaurant was torn down. In 1958, Central Building opened as a modern retail and office building, as it has remained at the present day.

This method is a multivariate or even megavariate extension of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The variation partitioning is similar to ANOVA. Each partition matches all variation induced by an effect or factor, usually a treatment regime or experimental condition. The calculated effect partitions are called effect estimates. Because even the effect estimates are multivariate, interpretation of these effects estimates is not intuitive. By applying SCA on the effect estimates one gets a simple interpretable result.Smilde, Age K.; Jansen, Jeroen J.; Hoefsloot, Huub C. J.; Lamers, Robert-Jan A.

Daniel J Vis , Johan A Westerhuis , Age K Smilde: Jan van der Greef (2007) \\"Statistical validation of megavariate effects in ASCA\\", BMC Bioinformatics\\" , 8:322 In case of more than one effect this method estimates the effects in such a way that the different effects are not correlated.  Details  Many research areas see increasingly large numbers of variables in only few samples. The low sample to variable ratio creates problems known as multicollinearity and singularity. Because of this, most traditional multivariate statistical methods cannot be applied.  ASCA algorithm  This section details how to calculate the ASCA model on a case of two main effects with one interaction effect. It is easy to extend the declared rationale to more main effects and more interaction effects. If the first effect is time and the second effect is dosage, only the interaction between time and dosage exists. We assume there are four time points and three dosage levels. Let X be a matrix that holds the data. X is mean centered, thus having zero mean columns. Let A and B denote the main effects and AB the interaction of these effects. Two main effects in a biological experiment can be time (A) and pH (B), and these two effects may interact. In designing such experiments one controls the main effects to several (at least two) levels. The different levels of an effect can be referred to as A1, A2, A3 and A4, representing 2, 3, 4, 5 hours from the start of the experiment. The same thing holds for effect B, for example, pH 6, pH 7 and pH 8 can be considered effect levels. A and B are required to be balanced if the effect estimates need to be orthogonal and the partitioning unique. Matrix E holds the information that is not assigned to any effect. The partitioning gives the following notation: : X = A+B+AB+E \\\\,  Calculating main effect estimate A (or B)  Find all rows that correspond to effect A level 1 and averages these rows. The result is a vector. Repeat this for the other effect levels. Make a new matrix of the same size of X and place the calculated averages in the matching rows. That is, give all rows that match effect (i.e.) A level 1 the average of effect A level 1. After completing the level estimates for the effect, perform an SCA. The scores of this SCA are the sample deviations for the effect, the important variables of this effect are in the weights of the SCA loading vector.  Calculating interaction effect estimate AB  Estimating the interaction effect is similar to estimating main effects. The difference is that for interaction estimates the rows that match effect A level 1 are combined with the effect B level 1 and all combinations of effects and levels are cycled through. In our example setting, with four time point and three dosage levels there are 12 interaction sets {A1-B1, A1B2, A2B1, A2B2 and so on}. It is important to deflate (remove) the main effects before estimating the interaction effect.  SCA on partitions A, B and AB  Simultaneous component analysis is mathematically identical to PCA, but is semantically different in that it models different objects or subjects at the same time. The standard notation for a SCA ‚Äì and PCA ‚Äì model is: : X=TP^{'}+E \\\\, where X is the data, T are the component scores and P are the component loadings. E is the residual or error matrix. Because ASCA models the variation partitions by SCA, the model for effect estimates looks like this: : A=T_{a}P_{a}^{'}+E_{a} \\\\, : B=T_{b}P_{b}^{'}+E_{b} \\\\, : AB=T_{ab}P_{ab}^{'}+E_{ab} \\\\, : E=T_{e}P_{e}^{'}+E_{e} \\\\, Note that every partition has its own error matrix. However, algebra dictates that in a balanced mean centered data set every two level system is of rank 1. This results in zero errors, since any rank 1 matrix can be written as the product of a single component score and loading vector. The full ASCA model with two effects and interaction including the SCA looks like this: Decomposition: : X=A+B+AB+E \\\\, : X=T_{a}P_{a}^{'}+T_{b}P_{b}^{'}+T_{ab}P_{ab}^{'}+T_{e}P_{e}^{'}+E_{a}+E_{b}+E_{ab}+E_{e}+E \\\\,  Time as an effect  Because 'time' is treated as a qualitative factor in the ANOVA decomposition preceding ASCA, a nonlinear multivariate time trajectory can be modeled. An example of this is shown in Figure 10 of this reference.Smilde, A. K., Hoefsloot, H. C. and Westerhuis, J. A. (2008), \\"The geometry of ASCA\\". Journal of Chemometrics, 22, 464‚Äì471.

An eccentric, he is best known as the author of several historical books. Birth and ancestors Michael Pratt was born at Bayham, near Lamberhurst in Kent, the younger son of John Charles Henry Pratt, 5th Marquess Camden, and his second wife, Averil Streatfield. The Pratt family were lawyers and politicians, and became wealthy through large property holdings, particularly in Camden Town, although the last properties in London were sold circa 1946. His father later sold the 100-room neo-Jacobean mansion at Bayham Abbey, near the ruins of the medieval Bayham Abbey, and built a new house nearby. Education Pratt was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read modern history and was secretary of the Gridiron, a lunch and dining club founded in 1884. He sustained severe injuries as a passenger in a road accident while an undergraduate, and sat his exams with a broken back, graduating with a second class degree. He worked for a brief time as a merchant banker for Lazard Brothers in the City of London, but left to become a writer. Books He published his first book, Britain's Greek Empire, in 1978, reviewing the history of Corfu and the Ionian islands from the 15th century, when the influence of Byzantium ended, through rule by Venice from 1401 and then as a British protectorate from the Napoleonic Wars until 1863, when the islands became part of the newly independent Greece. His second book, Great Country Houses of Central Europe, was published in 1990, with a revised edition in 2005. Finally, he published Nelson's Duchy in 2005, on Castello Nelson and the estate at Bronte in Sicily, granted to Lord Nelson by Ferdinand III of Sicily and IV of Naples. He married Janet Giannuzzi Savelli in 1999. He suffered from poor health in later life, and underwent a triple heart bypass operation in 2006. He had a life interest in Bayham Manor through a family trust, but was often in dispute with his trustees. Near the end of his life, he was evicted by the trustees so they could sell the house and his prized 1986 Mercury Capri, but he was later let back in. He died at Bayham Manor in his sleep. He was survived by his wife. An inquest subsequently found that he had died after accidentally taking an overdose of the painkiller Tramadol at his house in Glen Ellyn, Il. Obituaries His obituaries variously describe him as a \\"brainy buffoon\\", \\"Wodehouseian\\", \\"unusual and abrasive\\", \\"jolly, boisterous and odd\\", and a \\"wildly self- indulgent eccentric\\", with an unmistakable physical appearance, often wearing a three-piece suit with capri pants, pink or purple socks and highly polished co-respondent shoes, topped by an untidy hat. He was at home in the gentlemen's clubs of St. James's, where he frequented White's and Pratt's, and had his hair cut at Trumper's. A scathing anonymous obituary published in The Daily Telegraph on 8 September 2007 described him as \\"an unabashed snob and social interloper on a grand scale\\". It criticised him for outstaying his welcome as a house guest and failing to contribute to the cost of the lavish, over-engineered turbo kits he was famous for commissioning, and for \\"regaling listeners with stories of family matters\\". He was described as being unlucky with cars, having been involved in several unsuccessful blower combos, and accident-prone with guns. Nor was he adept at running baths. A commentator in The Guardian described the obituary as the \\"least hagiographic obit ever published in the Telegraph.\\"\\"Sometimes it's right to speak ill of the dead\\", The Guardian, 12 September 2007 Other obituaries, notably in The Times and The Independent, stressed his generosity, good humour and wide circle of friends. A number of letters to the editor of The Daily Telegraph included one published on 11 September, which described the obituary as \\"mean-spirited\\", \\"in a number of respects, false\\", \\"a travesty of the truth\\", and \\"wicked\\" resulting in an apology some days later following a series of protests to the Editor from his many friends.Lord Michael's friends, The Daily Telegraph letters, 11 September 2007 References Category:1946 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from the Borough of Tunbridge Wells Category:Younger sons of marquesses Michael Category:20th-century English historians ","title":"Lord Michael Pratt"},{"id":"13371250","text":"Marianne Koch in 2018 Marianne Koch (; born 19 August 1931) is a retired German actress of the 1950s and 1960s, best known for her appearances in spaghetti westerns and adventure films of the 1960s. She later worked as a television host and as a physician.  Career  Between 1950 and 1971, Koch appeared in more than 65 films, among them a number of international film productions. In the haunting 1954 espionage thriller Night People she starred alongside Gregory Peck. Sergio Leone's 1964 production A Fistful of Dollars showcased her alongside Clint Eastwood as a civilian tormented by ruthless local gangsters, torn between her husband and child and the villains. In Germany she was probably best-loved for her many years of participation in the highly popular TV game show Was bin ich?, the German adaption of the American TV show What's My Line, which ran from the 1950s until 1988 and achieved ratings of up to 75% at its peak. In 1971, she resumed the medical studies she had broken off in the early 1950s to become an actress. She earned her Medical Doctor degree in 1974 and practiced medicine until 1997 as a specialist in Munich. Also in 1974, she was one of the initial hosts of Germany's pioneering talk show 3 nach 9 (Three After Nine), for which she was awarded one of the most prestigious awards of the German television industry, the Grimme-Preis. She also hosted other television shows and, as of 2014, still has a medical advice program on radio.  Personal life  Koch is the daughter of Marie Aum√ºller and Rudolf Schindler.

A dwarf form, no subspecies are currently recognized. Like all pythons, they are nonvenomous constrictors; unlike larger species such as the reticulated python, they are not considered dangerous to humans. Description The Timor python is a fairly long (over 7 ft), but relatively thin python. It has a series of heat-sensing pits between its nostrils and mouth used to find warm-blooded prey in total darkness. It is cold- blooded.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Distribution and habitat Found in Southeast Asia on the Lesser Sunda Islands (Flores, Lombien and Timor islands), its type locality is given as \\"Kupang, (Timor)\\" [Indonesia]. Feeding Captive specimens have been known to accept birds and small mammals. Taxonomy Liasis amethystinus var. timoriensis was the scientific name proposed by Johann Gottlob Schneider in 1801. Authors of a phylogenetic study suggested that the Timor python together with the reticulated python should be moved to a distinct genus Broghammerus. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses have supported the separation of the Timor and reticulated pythons from genus Python. However, Broghammerus is considered an invalid name by most authorities, which made Reynolds et al. formally rename this clade Malayopython in 2014, a decision that was followed by many authors.

The cartoon featured a conversation between an elderly man and a boy culminating in the boy making a joke using the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Bangladeshi Muslim organisations, who objected to the cartoon, responded by holding public protests which led to violence and street clashes, even though such demonstrations have been banned by the interim caretaker government. Arifur Rahman, the author of the cartoon, was arrested and detained while the publishers have publicly apologised.  Controversy  On 17 September 2007, a cartoon titled Naam (Name) was published in the 431st edition of Alpin. The cartoon, by 20-year-old cartoonist Arifur Rahman, featured a conversation between an elderly man and a boy and the controversy is regarding the text rather than the pictures as had been the case in previous such incidents. When the boy was asked what his name was, he omitted the prefix Muhammad, used by some Muslims to show respect to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The elder informed him that he should use the prefix in front of all names. In the final strip, the man asked the boy what was in his lap to which he replied \\"Muhammad cat\\". The country's mainly Muslim population regarded the publication of the cartoon in their holy month of Ramadhan as a deliberate attempt to ridicule Muhammad, who is highly revered by Muslims, and ignite unrest in the country. Demonstrations were held the following day in major cities, even though such protests were made unlawful by the interim caretaker government earlier in 2007. Formal representations were made by Muslim leaders to the government during meetings held on 18 September with calls for revoking the license of the newspaper, Prothom Alo. The government banned the sale of the 431st issue and instructed the authorities to seize all printed copies while urging the public to exercise self-restraint, and arrested Arifur Rahman. In a statement released by Prothom Alo, the editor of Alpin, Matiur Rahman, apologised, expressing regret for publishing the cartoon. He stated that the \\"unedited, unapproved and unacceptable\\" cartoon is being withdrawn and would be \\"taking actions against the persons responsible\\". However, religious clerics of the country continued their outcry and demanded the arrest of Matiur Rahman and Prothom Alo's publisher, Mahfuz Anam. Rahman's trial In 2007, after publishing the cartoon was huge demonstration in Bangladesh and was multiple trial against cartoonist Arifur Rahman. Rahman was jailed under Bangladesh's emergency laws.  Dhaka court  Rahman was charged with \\"hurting religious sentiments\\" under Penal Code Section 295A and given a thirty-day detention order; this was later extended for an additional three months. Amnesty International designated Rahman a prisoner of conscience and called for his \\"immediate and unconditional release\\". Reporters Without Borders also issued a statement on his behalf calling for his release, saying, \\"The government should not yield to pressure from extremist leaders who are trying to politicise the case. Rahman should not be made a scapegoat. He must be freed.\\" The cartoonist was arrested for six months and two days, arrested 18 September 2007,Human Rights in Bangladesh 2007. Arifur Rahman, faced arrest and detention for over six months and released by court order on 20 March 2008, after the police officer who filed a case against him repeatedly failed to appear in court.  Jessore court  On 12 November 2009, a Jessore court was handed down two months of rigorous imprisonment to cartoonist Arifur Rahman, also have to pay Tk 500 in fine or another seven days in prison.

Except when ACAS have been involved and arranged a COT3 settlement, COT3 being the name of the form used, compromise agreements are the only means whereby an employee can waive statutory claims such as unfair dismissal, discrimination or entitlements to a redundancy payment.What is Unfair Dismissal The agreement will only be valid where (i) it is in writing and (ii) the employee has received independent legal advice from a relevant adviser who has professional indemnity insurance. An employee cannot compromise potential future claims, though claims that have already arisen, unknown to the employee, can be waived. The Employment Rights Act 1996 provides at Section 203 for the conditions relating to the validity of Compromise Agreements. The Equality Act 2010 also regulates the conditions for the validity of Compromise Agreements, but a possible drafting error may have affected the scope of Compromise Agreements to settle discrimination complaints. In practice, a compromise agreement will also contain a waiver of any claim for breach of contract as well as statutory claims, though such a waiver does not need to satisfy the same requirements in order to be valid, as a claim for breach of contract is a common-law claim. Each agreement should be tailored to meet the facts and circumstances of the case. It is therefore difficult to adopt a one size fits all approach to drafting of a compromise agreement, although this approach might be used if appropriate in more generic cases. The detail and existence of a compromise agreement should remain confidential from third parties. The advantage for the employer is that they are able to draw a line under an employee's departure or complaint and are protected from future claims. The advantage for the employee is the consideration, such as a financial sum, received in return is provided for by a legally-binding contract. In addition to confidentiality clauses, a Compromise Agreement may also include an agreed reference. A breach of the compromise agreement and any financial loss that breach may incur for the other party, can result in legal action in a court of law. In January 2013, the UK Government proposed a number of changes. This includes renaming compromise agreements as \\"settlement agreements\\".

Early life and family Fletcher was born in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, on 3 July 1863, the son of David Fletcher and his wife Margaret Ann Duncan. After briefly working for the Midland Railway Company, he became a sailor for eight years with the Dundee Shipping Line, and arrived in New Zealand in 1883. He worked as a sailor in coastal shipping until 1885, when he became a pilot for the Wellington Harbour Board and, later, worked on the wharves. He was a prominent Freemason in Wellington. Political career=Local-body politics Fletcher was elected as a member of the Wellington Harbour Board in 1906, and held his seat until his death in 1918. He served as the board's chair between 1910 and 1915. From 1907 to 1915 he was also a member of the Wellington City Council. Fletcher contested the 1915 mayoralty contest, coming second to incumbent Mayor John Luke. Member of Parliament The electorate was formed for the , and it was held from the beginning by Francis Fisher (known as Rainbow Fisher for his frequent changes of political allegiance). The 1911 general election required a second ballot if no candidate could achieve an absolute majority in the first round. The election was contested by Fisher (for the Reform Party), Fletcher, Tom Young (Labour Party) and Frank Freeman (Socialist Party), with Fisher having a majority of one vote over Fletcher. In the second ballot a week later, Fisher beat Fletcher with a majority of 150 votes. By the next general election in 1914, the incumbent Fisher as a government minister contested Wellington Central against Fletcher again, and he was decisively beaten by 2677 votes to 4910. Fletcher represented Wellington Central in Parliament until 4 September 1918, when he died at his home in Wellington, having been in poor health for over a year. The by-election caused by his death was won by future Prime Minister Peter Fraser of the Labour Party.

His position of choice was on the , though he played later in his career. Mackay competed in and won the Gladiator Individual Sports Athletes Challenge in 1995. Playing career=1980s Mackay was a schoolboy rugby union representative with the Sydney Combined High Schools side. He was graded by Western Suburbs in 1987 and made his first grade d√©but in round 1 of the 1988 season. He was a regular first-grader in 1989 and a capable goal-kicker booting 19 conversions and scoring six tries in his second top-grade season. 1990s Indifferent form saw Mackay make only eleven appearances in Wests' run-on side in 1990 and at the end of that season he was swapped by Wests in the short-lived and controversial draft system which existed in Australian rugby league solely in the 1991 season. A strong runner and defender Mackay added the strength of an extra forward to the backline. He was a member of the Panthers successful 1991 premiership side. Following the grand final victory he travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan. Mackay was 31st draft choice when snapped up by Penrith coach Phil Gould. Under Gould as State coach, Mackay made his representative d√©but for New South Wales on the wing in game I of the 1992 State of Origin series. He also played in game II of 1992. In 1992 he made his Australian national d√©but in a Test match against Papua New Guinea in Townsville. Mackay scored two tries in a man-of-the-match performance on d√©but. He was chosen in Australia's World Cup squad at year's end, he did not play in the final. Mackay regularly competed for a New South Wales wing spot against Andrew Ettingshausen, gaining selection in State of Origin game III of 1993 and game I of 1994 (NSW selectors though always had the luxury of playing ET at either fullback, wing or centre). Despite his goal-kicking ability and strong bursts down the flank, his representative form was inconsistent and he was dropped after the Blues' game I loss of 1994. Mackay quit the Panthers at the end of 1994 to link with his former coach Gould at Easts. He spent the 1995 season there and returned to good goal-kicking form booting 20 goals in just 13 games. In 1996 he joined the South Queensland Crushers for that club's second season in the ARL. Following a pay dispute with the cash-strapped Crushers, he joined the neighbouring Gold Coast Chargers, and captained the Chargers during the final two years of the club's existence. Following the demise of the Gold Coast, Mackay signed with his sixth club, the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles for the 1999 NRL season. 2000s In 2000 he transferred to Super League club, Leeds. In the 2000 Rugby League World Cup tournament Mackay represented Scotland. Mackay switched to Bradford Bulls in 2001. He played for them at centre, scoring a try, and kicking a goal in their 2001 Super League Grand Final victory against Wigan. The swansong of his long and varied first grade career was in 2002 with Hull F.C. In 2003 he joined the Ipswich Jets under coach Trevor Gillmeister. Mackay started coaching the Ormeau Shearers on the Gold Coast in 2012.

It is the \\"Mother Church\\" for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry, as well as the parish Church of the parish of Templemore. History It wasn't until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, that the possibility of building a Roman Catholic cathedral in Derry could be contemplated. Fundraising for the building of the cathedral took place from 1840. Work began on the construction of the cathedral in 1849. The cathedral's location is next to Francis Street and Creggan Street in Derry. The total cost of building the cathedral amounted to just over ¬£40,000. Money was raised not just in Derry and Ireland, but also in America where around ¬£4,000 was raised. The architect commissioned to design the cathedral was James Joseph McCarthy who had already built numerous cathedrals across Ireland. The plan of the cathedral is a simple neo-Gothic expression. The cathedral was officially opened on 4 May 1873 by the then Bishop of Derry, Francis Kelly. The project to build the cathedral's bell tower and spire was postponed, as no funds were available for the project. At first the cathedral's windows were made of plain glass due to lack of funds. It was not until the late 1890s when stained glass windows were installed. Work on the bell tower and spire began on 13 August 1900, with the building contract awarded to Courtney and Co from Belfast. Work was completed on 19 June 1903. Post Vatican II changes The changes to the Roman Catholic liturgy in 1962/1964 meant that the sanctuary of the cathedral had to be reorganised. In May 1964 a temporary wooden altar was placed in the sanctuary to accommodate the mass being said in English and facing the congregation. Further temporary work was carried out in late 1975 with the addition of a larger wooden altar on a newly extended wooden sanctuary floor, the removal of the altar rails and the removal of the smaller pulpit on the cathedral's left hand side of the sanctuary whilst retaining the main pulpit located at the right hand side of the cathedral sanctuary. The wooden statues which adorned the main large pulpit's large canopy were removed and placed at other locations in the cathedral sanctuary just in time before Christmas Midnight Mass was transmitted live via Eurovision from the cathedral. In 1984 fundraising began for the renovation work to the cathedral, which its main structure was over a hundred years old and in desperate need of repair. From 1984 until 1988, exterior renovation work took place on the cathedral with the extension of the sacristy and building of a brand new conference room. In June 1989 the cathedral was closed for six months for a permanent reorganisation of the sanctuary. The old temporary fittings were removed and a new sanctuary floor made from Sardinian granite was completed. A new square altar made from Carrara marble was made and installed in the sanctuary under the chancel arch. The old pulpit was taken out and a brand new lectern made of marble was installed. The celebrant's chair and tabernacle stand were all made from Carrara and Macedonian marble. A new tabernacle was made in silver-plated bronze, and was constructed by a Kilkenny silversmith, Peter Donovan. A new secondary porch was created in the main entrance in the 1989 renovations along with a new small porch in the North aisle. The main high altar table was taken out, however the original reredos which was installed in 1904, was kept. A new lighting scheme was installed, to give the cathedral more brightness and warmth which it had lacked for many years. A new sound system was also installed which gave the cathedral excellent amplification. The whole interior of the cathedral was redecorated. The cathedral's brand new interior was opened and consecrated by the then Bishop of Derry, Edward Daly on 17 December 1989. On Monday 25 May 2015 extensive refurbishment and renovation work commenced in the cathedral. Details of the refurbishment and renovation work which would be undertaken in the cathedral in the coming months ahead was outlined in their parish bulletin. \\"As custodians of this sacred, listed building of St Eugene‚Äôs Cathedral, it has become necessary to carry out essential repairs and refurbishment primarily associated with damage caused by the entrance of moisture to the fabric of the building. This is affecting internal finishes, stained glass windows and external masonry (ie St Columba‚Äôs and St Patrick‚Äôs windows). The damp entering the aisle wall at the choir is causing large sections of internal plaster to boast. The spiral staircase to the bell tower is cracked and unsafe. The existing wrought iron ladder and platform to the spire from the bell tower is unsafe and as a result the spire parapet gutter has not been maintained for several years. The works will cost ¬£353,480. The works will begin on Monday, 25th May and will continue for 20 weeks. The main contractor is Stewart & McConnell, Derry (lowest tender)\\". On the week of 16 November 2015, restoration work on the cathedral concluded. Current use On Sunday 13 December 2015, the bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, opened a \\"Holy Door\\" in the cathedral to commence the extraordinary Jubilee Year of Mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, which will run until Sunday 20 November 2016. The \\"Holy Door\\" is the main entrance door to the cathedral. The entrance porch has been completely refurbished. On entering the porch you are now greeted by eight newly positioned oak statues of Saints Columba, Patrick, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Mary and Joseph. These statues used to be part of the canopy of the old pulpit in the cathedral from 1906 to 1989. A stone statue of Saint Eugene adorns the outside of the entrance porch embedded in the main bell tower of the cathedral; it has been there since the cathedral was built in 1873. In the newly refurbished porch the words from the prophet Isaiah, \\"Do not be afraid I have redeemed you and called you by your name. You are mine\\", are engraved in the wall. On Sunday 13 November 2016, Bishop Donal McKeown officially closed the \\"Holy Door\\" to mark the end of the Jubilee Year of Mercy which concluded on Sunday 20 November 2016 in the Roman Catholic Church. On Monday 8 August 2016 the retired bishop of Derry Edward Daly died at the age of 82. His remains were brought to the cathedral that evening, and over a period of two and a half days an estimated 25,000 people came to pay their last respects to Bishop Daly's remains which laid at rest inside the cathedral on public display. His funeral mass took place in the cathedral on Thursday 11 August 2016, where over a thousand people packed into the cathedral. Irish President Michael D Higgins, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and representatives of the Queen, the British and Irish governments and City of Derry dignitaries, including Deputy Mayor Jim McKeever, were also present. The sitting mayor alderman Hillary McClintock from the DUP didn't attend the funeral due to unforeseen circumstances. But paid tribute to Bishop Daly by article and opened a book of condolences in the Guildhall. The current bishop of Derry, Most Reverend Donal McKeown, was the celebrant of the Requiem Mass, which was concelebrated by the Primate of All Ireland, Derry-born Archbishop Eamon Martin, retired archbishop of Armagh Sean Brady, other bishops and clergy from across the Derry Diocese and around Ireland. Representatives of the other Christian churches in Derry City, including former Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe ‚Äì James Mehaffey, who was very close friends with Bishop Daly ‚Äì attended. Immediately after the Requiem Mass, Bishop Daly was buried in a plot located within the grounds of the cathedral alongside his predecessor Bishop Neil Farren, Bishop of Derry from 1939 to 1973, who was buried there in 1980. In November 2016, the old confessional rooms in the cathedral which were built and opened in 1989 were closed and new confessionals which were constructed at the back of the cathedral near the main entrance doors during the summer of 2016, were opened. This was done to encourage people who enter the cathedral through the main entrance doors to think about going to confession. It also made it easier for people, having the confessionals located at the back of the cathedral and not away up near the top of the cathedral, adjacent to the sacristy. The new confessionals were blessed by Bishop Donal McKeown at Sunday Mass on 20 November 2016. The area which was the old confessional rooms since 1989 were converted into a new side chapel dedicated to Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta. The new chapel was blessed and dedicated by the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, during the cathedral parish's annual nine day Novena to Saint Therese of Lisuex. On Friday 12 May 2017 at a special prayer service at 7:30 pm in the cathedral, parishioners and clergy were joined by nuns from Mother Teresa's order, who joined the packed congregation in the cathedral for Evening Prayer and a special dedication ceremony for the new chapel. Today the chapel is used by prayer groups, and it is also used for daily Eucharistic Adoration from 8:30 am ‚Äì 10:00 am Mondays to Fridays.https://www.derrynow.com/news/new- chapel-dedicated-to-mother-teresa-to-be-created-in-st-eugenes-cathedral/96105 Organs The organ has always been located in a west end gallery. The original organ was built by Telford of Dublin and installed in 1873. In the mid 1950s this instrument was replaced with an 11 rank extension organ by the John Compton Organ company of London. Only for the cathedral's extremely lively acoustic, the instrument is of questionable musical quality. No pipes are visible, which detracts greatly from the overall appearance of the West end. The fine stone carved gallery and rose window above, are marred by what looks more like a loudspeaker cabinet than an organ. By the late 1990s this organ had fallen into only sporadic use, with the main Sunday services being accompanied by a Johannus electronic instrument located in the south aisle. The cathedral today Saint Eugene's Cathedral forms part of the Parish of Templemore in the city of Derry, which also includes Saint Columba's Church, Long Tower. The Bishop of Derry ‚Äì Most Reverend Donal McKeown is the Parish Priest of the Templemore Parish. Bishop McKeown was installed as Bishop of Derry in the cathedral on Sunday 6 April 2014. The bells of the cathedral can be heard over the Derry area each day at 8:00am, 12:00pm, 6:00pm and 9:00pm, ringing out seasonal tunes and calling parishioners to masses.

However, with the finding of old lost Puya (written documents) called Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Amailon Pukok Puya which was written around 1398 BCE (verified by National Archives of India, New Delhi on 29/11/1989) at the time of King Mongyamba, the kings of Kangleipak need to be updated. Since ancient times, the Meitei people have lived in the valleys of Manipur alongside the highlanders in the hills and valley in peace. Pangal (Muslims) people settled in the valleys during the reign of Meidingu Khagemba in the year 1606. Since then, they also lived along with the Meitei. Mythological origins begin with the reign of the \\"Konchin Tukthapa Ipu Athoupa Pakhangpa\\" (Pakhangpa was the name given to him meaning \\"The one who knows his father\\"), who gave birth the seven clans of Meitei society. Manipur became a princely state under British rule in 1891, the last of the independent states to be incorporated into British India. During the Second World War, Manipur was the scene of battles between Japanese and Allied forces. The Japanese were beaten back before the Allies could enter Imphal. This proved to be one of the turning points of the war. After the war, the Manipur Constitution Act, 1947, established a democratic form of government with the Maharaja as the Executive Head and an elected legislature. In 1949, Maharaja Bodhachandra was summoned to Shillong, capital of the Indian province of Meghalaya where he signed a Treaty of Accession merging the kingdom into India. Thereafter the legislative assembly was dissolved and Manipur became part of the Republic of India in October, 1949. It was made a union territory in 1956 and a full-fledged state in 1972. Mairembam Koireng Singh became the first Chief Minister in 1972 of the State of Manipur.http://twocircles.net/2014nov21/1416545962.html#.VHH48cnUZ5c Mythological origins Mythological origins begin with the reign of the \\"Konchin Tukthapa Ipu Athoupa Pakhangpa\\" (Pakhangpa was the name given to him meaning \\"The one who knows his father\\").

Kanglei which is now called \\"Kangla\\" was the first capital of the kingdom called \\"Kangleipak\\". \\"Lainingthou Sanamahi\\" is the creator of all according to \\"Kangleichas\\", the then residents of the now called Manipur. The religion of the land was purely \\"Sanamahism\\", one of the oldest religions of the world. The Hindu legends also described about the scenic beauty of Manipur valley surrounded by the eastern Himalayan ranges. The term is derived from name of the state of Manipur.Chelliah (1997: 2) Manipur itself has basis on Hindu epic Mahabharata, in which a shining diamond called mani ('jewel') in Sanskrit is thrown from the head of a snake god Vasuki, which spreads natural beauty throughout the land. Manipuri is the official name of the language for the Indian government and is used by government institutions and non-Meitei authors. Additionally, Manipuri, being a loconym, can refer to anything pertaining to Manipur state. Nomenclature Manipur had been known throughout the ages as Meitrabak, Kangleipak or MeeteileipakLaininghan Naoria Phulo, Meetei Haubham Wari (The Origin History of Meiteis), 1934. as well as by more than twenty other names.Naorem Sanajaoba, Manipur Past and Present, Mittal Publication, Delhi, 2005 Sanamahi Laikan wrote that Manipur's new nomenclature was adopted in the eighteenth century during the reign of Meidingu Pamheiba. According to Sakok Lamlen, the area had different names according to the era. During the Hayachak period it was known as Mayai Koiren poirei namthak saronpung or Tilli Koktong Ahanba, then in the Khunungchak period as Meera Pongthoklam. Thereafter during the Langbachak era, it became Tilli Koktong Leikoiren and finally Muwapalli in the Konnachak epoch.Ningthoujongjam Khelchandra, History of Ancient Manipuri Literature, Manipuri Sahitya Parishad, 1969 During the latter part of its history, Manipur and its people were known by different names to their neighbours. The Shans or Pongs called the area Cassay, the Burmese Kathe, and the Assamese Meklee. In the first treaty between the British East India Company and Meidingu Chingthangkhomba (Bhagyachandra) signed in 1762, the kingdom was recorded as Meckley. Bhagyachandra and his successors issued coins engraved with the title of Manipureshwar, or lord of Manipur and the name Meckley was discarded. Later on, the Sanskritisation work, Dharani Samhita (1825-34) popularized the legends of the derivation of Manipur's name.Gangmuei Kabui, History of Manipur, National Publishing House, Delhi, 1991. Prehistoric Manipur=Prehistory of Kangleipak or Manipur Manipur is situated on the tertiary ranges of a branch of the eastern Himalayas running south and forms part of the compact physiographic unit following the great divide between the Brahmaputra and Chindwin valleys. Northeast India holds the key to the understanding the scope, depth, dimension and cultural diffusion between south Asia, southeast Asia, Polynesia and Micronesia which played a crucial role in transforming the northeast Indian ethnographic canvas from prehistoric times onwards. Manipur appears to have absorbed Bronze Age cultural traits from Thailand and Upper Burma where indigenous early metal age culture developed at a comparatively early date around 4000 BC. =Old Stone Age= The four Khangkhui Caves are located near Khangkhui some south-east of Ukhrul on the border with Upper Burma. Archaeological excavations have found stone and bone tools as well as animal remains as evidence of Stone Age habitation of these caves.Sharma, T.C. \\"Studies in the Sources of Pre-History of Manipur and Nagaland\\" (1985) pp. 13-18 in Pandey S.N. (ed.) Sources of the History of Manipur, Imphal: Manipur University The first evidence of Pleistocene man in Manipur dates back to about 30,000 BC. Other notable caves nearby include Hunding Caves, south of Ukhrul, Purul Cave in Purul and the Song Ring rock shelter at Beyang village in Tengnoupal. One of archaeologist O.K. Singh's most valuable findings is a pebble chopping tool discovered in Maring Naga Village, Machi, in the Chandel district.O.K. Singh, Archaeology in Manipur (Series-I): \\"Napachik, A Stone Age Site in Manipur Valley\\", 1984 The Marings are one of the oldest tribes of Manipur and this find is considered as a landmark in the Paleolithic archaeology of Manipur, as it confirms, the area was inhabited by Neolithic people from the early Stone Age or lower Paleolithic period. =New Stone Age= *Hoabinhian Culture - A large number of Neolithic celts have been discovered throughout Manipur and are now preserved in the State College Museum Archaeology Department. These celts are mostly edge-ground pebble and flake tools and show the presence of Neolithic culture in Manipur. Findings in the Tharon Caves in the Tamenglong district provide the first concrete evidence of Hoabinhian and Lapita culture in India, a Mesolithic Southeast Asian and Polynesian cultural pattern based on historic finds from the village of Haobihian in North Vietnam and Lapita in Tonga. Similar relics have been found in Thailand at the Spirit Caves as well as in Burma and other places in Southeast Asia, Micronesia and Polynesia. Tharon is a Liangmei village where the five caves and rock shelters were first explored in December 1979 by the State Archaeology Department. The site is located at 93.32‚Äô longitude and 25.3‚Äô latitude in the midst of the thickly forested Reyangling Hills, about north of Tharon Village. Locally, the caves are known as Kalemki (from Kalem (bat) and Ki (house), literally: The house of the bat). A stream called Kalem-ki-magu runs near the caves, which are composed of Barail series sandstone and were probably formed by rock weathering. Tharon's edge-ground pebble tools are similar to finds from Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Fiji, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Niue, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, Nauru, Tokelau, the Cook Islands, Hawaii, Samoa, American Samoa, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Pitcairn Islands and Tonga where they were used about 7000-8000 BC. The Tharons have a distinct affinity with the Haobihian culture and before the advent of the present Tibeto-Burman inhabitants of the area, Proto-Australoid people occupied these caves around 5000-4000 BC. Napachik is a Stone Age site dating to the second millennium BC. It is on a small hillock near Meetei Village, Wangu, in the southern part of the Imphal Valley, on the right bank of the Manipur River which flows into the Chindwin River in Burma. The edge- ground tools and corded wares of Napachik are similar to those found in the Spirit Cave in Thailand, the Padubtin Cave in Burma, the Lapita sites in Tonga along with Haobihian sites in Vietnam although tripod wares were also found at one of the Haobihian sites. Possible dates for the Neolithic age in northeast India are between 500 BC and 2000 BC. It is probable that, while Napachik culture has an affinity with that of Haobihian, handmade corded tripod wares from Chinese Neolithic culture arrived in the area around the second millennium BC showing that the Manipur valley was already inhabited by Neolithic men in or around 2000 BC. Ancient Manipur The source for this era is the Cheitharol Kumbaba, the royal chronicle of Manipur or Kangleipak. *Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (33-154 AD) was ruler and the creator of Manipur (or Meeteileipak or Kangleipak). He was the first crowned historical ruler whose reign began in 33 AD;according to the Cheitharol Kumbaba. Meitei culture took root during the reign of Pakhangba as did Sagol Kangjei (polo), with the first match played between the chiefs of different regions. Polo was played in imitation of a game from the traditional Hayachak era. Laisna took a major role in organizing the game. Pakhangba was succeeded by his son, Khuiyoi Tompok, in 154 AD. Known as the inventor of the drum (pung), his reign was a peaceful one. Technical innovation in metallurgy was also recorded in the chronicle. *Naophangba (428-518 AD)''' The treatise on the construction of the places of Kangla and Kangla Houba are believed to have been written by Ashangba Laiba. Manipur of Loiyumba Period in Southeast Asia Map *Meidingu Loiyumba (1074-1122 AD) was known as the \\"Great law Giver\\", his reign was an important period in the history of Kangleipak. Along with the military consolidation of the kingdom, Loiyumba introduced administrative reforms, which provided the backbone of the kingdom's administration for the next seven centuries. He systematized the administrative divisions of the country by creating six lups or divisions as well as introducing the Pana System. He left a well-organized society and economy in Meeteileipak. Medieval Manipur *Meidingu Ningthou Khomba (1432-1467) was the \\"Conqueror of Tamu\\"...One of the most well-known events of Charairongba's reign was a raid by the Tangkhul tribe from Tuisem village while he was absent. His queen Linthoingambi demonstrated courage and skill, hoodwinking the raiding tribesmen into defeat and captivity. The Meitei state was completely established during his reign. *Meidingu Senbi Kiyamba (1467-1508) was known as the \\"Conqueror of Kabaw Valley\\". He was formerly called Thangwai Ningthouba. Credit for the military and territorial expansion of the kingdom was given to King Ningthou Khomba and his son Kiyamba who had an equally colourful mother, Linthoingambi, the warrior queen in Manipur's history. This period sees the emergence of Medingu Senbi Kiyamba, who became king in 1476, at the age of 24. He was a friend of the King of Pong (Shan Kingdom). King Kyamba of Manipur along with Chaopha Khe Khomba, the king of Pong, conquered Kyang, a Shan kingdom in the Kabow Valley of present Myanmar. Jubilant at the victory, an idol of Lord Vishnu was given by the Pong king to King Kyamba. King Kyamba started worshipping the idol at Lumlangdong which then came to be known as Bishnupur i.e. abode of Vishnu. Subsequently, he built a Vishnu Temple of brick at Bishnupur which has now become a protected historical monument under the Ministry of H.R.D. (Archeology), Government of India. It is now standing as a symbol of the remains of ancient times. And the statue got by Kyamba from the Pong king is very important since it gives us the idea of the religious beliefs of those days and the very name that it had given. Manipur of Khagemba Period in Southeast Asia Map *Meidingu Khagemba (1597-1652) was known as the \\"Conqueror of the Chinese\\" (khagi: Chinese and Ngamba: conqueror). He consolidated and expanded his father's kingdom of Meitrabak, later successfully defending it from foreign invaders such as the Muslims, the Kachari and the Shans of the Kabaw Valley. Muslim settlement became more prominent after 1606 with the establishment of a Muslim Personal Law Board headed by a Qazi appointed by the king. According to the chronicle, the Meitei king attacked the principal Chinese village (or town) along with the many brave Meitei warrior and defeated their chief Chouopha Hongdei. Khagemba introduced bell metal currency in the kingdom and a number of coins from his reign have been found. His reign was considered to be the golden age of Meitei literature. He was a great patron of the traditional Lainingthou Cult. A contemporary text, the Khagemba Langjei, expresses the supremacy of Sanamahi as the Universal God of the Meiteis. Learned scholars who were well-known authorities on religion and theology in attendance at Khagemba's court were Apoimacha, Konok Thengra, Salam Sana, Yumnam Tomba, Khongngakhul Toppa and Langon Lukhoi. Khagemba was succeeded by his son Khunjaoba in 1652 who fortified Kangla and excavated a moat in the front of the brick gateway constructed by his father. Paikhomba ascended the throne in 1666 and consolidated his power in the valley. His kingdom extended as far as Samjok to the east and Takhel Tripura to the west. In 1679 the two Mughal (Chaghtai Turk) princes Shah Shuja and Mirza Baisanghar led a 37 strong Mughal entourage and settled in Manipur by taking local wives. With the dawn of the eighteenth century, *Meidingu Charairongba (1697-1709) achieved the full development of its culture, economy and state system. In this revolutionary period in the evolution of Meitrabak, three kings, father, son, and a great-grandson: Charairongba, Pamheiba and Chingthang Khomba played significant roles. After the death of Paikhomba, his nephew Charairongba, the son of his younger brother Tonsenngamba ascended the throne in 1697. His reign began the transition period from traditional Meitei culture to a Hinduised Meitei society. There were continual trade contacts and social relationships between Manipur and Burma. In 1702, the Toongoo dynasty of Awa (Burma) sent emissaries asking for the hand of a Meitei Princess. Charirongba gave his daughter Chakpa Makhao Ngambi in marriage to the Burmese King. He constructed several temples for Meitei deities such as Panthoibi, Sanamahi as well as ones dedicated to Hindu gods. Vaishnavism era Vaishnavism came to Manipur during this period and caused a significant change in the history of Manipur. The Meitei script was replaced with Bengali. *Meidingu Pamheiba (Garibnawaz) (1709-1748): Pamheiba ascended the throne on the 23rd Day of Thawan (August) 1709. His Persian name Garibniwaz, meaning \\"kind to the poor\\", was given to him by Muslim immigrants and was adopted to be used in the coinage he issued.. Actually he was the son of Charairongba. He was known as 'Kari-baniwas' which meant \\"a prince who was once lost\\" (Roy, J.- History of Manipur.p. 35.) Pamheiba's rise to prominence as a military conqueror can be divided into three phases. The first phase (1710-17) focused on internal consolidation of hill tribes. Phase two (1728-33) involved war against the Burmese kingdom of Awa, and the third and final phase (1745-48) saw a war against Tripura in the northeast. Shortly after taking power from his father Charairongba he invaded Burma after the Burmese King insulted his sister. The Burmese King asked for the hand of another of Charairongba's daughters in marriage in 1724. Instead of a princess, the King of Burma was met by cavalry, led by Pamheiba that massacred the Burmese army, and brought many prisoners of war to Imphal.Garib Niwaz: Wars and Religious Policy in 18th Century Manipur KanglaOnline The Burmese sent an expedition in revenge, but it was ambushed in the swamps near Heirok, southwest of Thoubal, and losing heavily retreated in haste. In 1735, Pamheiba invaded Myedu in Shwebo district and carried off loot, cattle and a thousand people. In 1737, Pamheiba again invaded Burma, killed two-thirds of a royal levy, including commander, who came to oppose the invading Manipuris, and swept down to Tabayin in Shwebo district, burning everything they met.Harvey 1925: 208 Again in 1738, Manipuris went and camped in Thalunbyu west of Sagaing, burnt every house and monastery up to the walls of Ava, stormed the stockade built to protect the Kaunghmudaw pagoda, slaughtering the Burmese troops like cattle in a pen and killing the commandant, a minister of the Hluttaw Council; the old door-leaves of the pagoda's eastern gateway show a gash made by the sword of Maharaj Pamheiba when he was forcing an entrance.Harvey 1925: 208-9 In 1734, Pamheiba invaded Tripura and captured 1100 prisoners, who were absorbed into the Meitei community.History of Manipur ‚Äì IIT Guwahati As a result, Pamheiba extended his kingdom from the Kabaw Valley, to the east as far as Nongnang (Cachar) and Takhel (Tripura) in the west. Conversion to Vaishnavism Pamheiba was also a major religious reformer and under his royal patronage Shri Chaitanya's school of Gaudiya Vaishnavism gradually spread across Meitrabak. The Cheitharol Kumbaba records that in October 1717, Graibnawaz was initiated into Vaishnavism by Guru Gopal Das. Later in life he also took instruction from the Ramanandi Sampradaya school of thought. Puya Meithaba (Burning of Puyas) Meetei PuYas and early literature vividly record the details of Meitei ethno-dispersion and dispersal of the Meetei outsides the geography of present Manipur into the neighbouring countries in Asia. A study of the Puyas at hand encounters the vexing problem of separating the myths from facts and locating the historical in the myriad of legends, traditions, folklore and narratives. Nevertheless, a comparative study of the various Puyas helps us in analysing the data objectively and within the historical framework. The PuYas may be defined as written records handed down to posterity by the forefathers of the Meiteis. They are a particular kind of old narratives which form a definite class in Manipuri literature. The five forms in which the Puyas are available to us and the subjects covered have been already dealt with. \\"Longthabalon and Sanggai Phammang are Puyas which are classified strictly under the group of genealogy. Leithak Leikharon, Khamlangba Erengba Puwari and Pudin are Puyas which deal with creation and cosmology in general as the central theme. Thalloi Nongkhailon and Erat Thounirol deal with various details of rituals. There is a class of Puyas which deal exclusively with a particular deity. Puyas such as Sanamahi Puya and Pakhangba Laihui help us to gather information on the parentage myths associated, names by which the deity is known, rituals to be performed for them, items of food or flowers to be offered etc. Panthoibi Khongul is another Puya which deals with a particular deity.http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.opinions.The_Effects_of_Burning_of_Meitei_Puyas_By_Madhu_Chandra # http://kanglaonline.com/2010/10/burning-of-puya-commemorated-as-black-day- by-acoam/ # https://www.imphaltimes.com/it-articles/item/11938-historical- evaluation-of-puya-meithaba-a-contemporary-re-interpretation Historical account of Meitei Pantheon Ancestor worship anywhere consists of customary beliefs and practices directed toward veneration of dead predecessors. In the religious system of the Meiteis, death is an indispensable condition for attaining ancestorhood. Leishemlon (The Meitei Christian Myth) shows two great time orders: The Hangko and Chak. The Leishemlon Ariba Puya divides the Hangko age into four major sub-periods: Ko-Hangko, Thoi-Hangko, Tayo-Hangko and Poi- Hangko. These periods were ruled by Chinggu Mapuren Sidaba, Pakhangba, Kourouhanba and Koubaren respectively. These four sub-periods cover 19,55,88,945 years, 16,29,906 years, 57,845 and 11,79,900 years, respectively, for a total of 19,84,56,596 years.http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.opinions.The_Effects_of_Burning_of_Meitei_Puyas_By_Madhu_Chandra # http://kanglaonline.com/2010/10/burning-of-puya-commemorated-as-black-day- by-acoam/ # https://www.imphaltimes.com/it-articles/item/11938-historical- evaluation-of-puya-meithaba-a-contemporary-re-interpretation Social Organisational Setup of Meiteis There are three types of such Puyas.

They are Ningthouja, Angom, Chengloi, Nganba or Khabanganaba, Luwang, Khuman and Moirang. \\"Sociologists tend to treat religion primarily as a social product.

Ancestor worship among the Meiteis find formal expression in the performance of various rites and rituals which are observed for the numerous lais through the year. The Meitei rituals are divided into two categories‚Äîprivate and public rituals. Private worship includes those rituals which are performed within the premises of a family. They are performed at three levels viz; phungga (hearth), sagei (sub-clan) and salai (clan). The public rituals, on the other hand, are observed in public places such as the premises of a local shrine, a selected site etc. The role of Maibas (priests) and Maibis (priestesses), who were not classified by birth. Every member of phungga, sagei and salai can become Maiba or Maibi. The concept of Maibi in social organisation setup and ritual practices among the Meiteis is a concept of gender equality and empowerment of women. The prophetic role of Maibis during Lai-Haraoba is reverent in a manner of fear and obedience. Social Hierarchy from Rina perspective: Social Hierarchy King Aristocratic Lineages (Belonging to the Royal Families) Salai and Sagei (Constituting the Majority of the Meitei Population) Lowest Social Group such as Lois and Yaithibis (Performing menial services for the royal household) Religious and Traditional Practices Meitei calendar replaced by Hindu calendar, e.g. Cheiraoba \\"The word Cheiraoba is derived from two words viz., chei: stick and laoba: to announce; to cry out. Cheiraoba therefore literally means ‚Äòto announce by a stick‚Äô or ‚Äòto cry out by means of a stick‚Äô. From the time of King Naophangba (428‚Äì518 A.D.), this festival was held publicly on the first day of the first month of the Meitei year through announcement of the beginning of the new year by the Lakpas (Divisional Officers).http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.opinions.The_Effects_of_Burning_of_Meitei_Puyas_By_Madhu_Chandra # http://kanglaonline.com/2010/10/burning-of-puya-commemorated-as-black-day- by-acoam/ # https://www.imphaltimes.com/it-articles/item/11938-historical- evaluation-of-puya-meithaba-a-contemporary-re-interpretation Repercussion of Puya Meithaba Widening the Gap ‚Äì the Valley and Hills In religious practice, the majority communities in Manipur also imposed on the tribal communities to adopt their culture like the wearing of dhotis, ritual dresses for tribal women when they become religious or in adopting cultural functions.http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.opinions.The_Effects_of_Burning_of_Meitei_Puyas_By_Madhu_Chandra # http://kanglaonline.com/2010/10/burning-of-puya-commemorated-as-black-day- by-acoam/ # https://www.imphaltimes.com/it-articles/item/11938-historical- evaluation-of-puya-meithaba-a-contemporary-re-interpretation New Identity Vaisnavite Meitheis Hindus acquired a new surname of \\"Sing\\" after their conversion to Vaishnavism.

Many other Meeteileipak place names in the Meitei language (Meeteilon) were also changed to Sanskrit. The Hinduised word \\"gotra\\" was introduced for the Seven Yek/Salais of Meiteis. Between 1717 and 1737, the Sanskrit epic parvas the Mahabharata and Ramayana were translated into Meitei while many other Sanskrit Parvas were written by Angom Gopi (1710-1780), the renowned scholar and poet at the court of Pamheiba. The king and all the Meiteis were converted as Kshatriya by relating to Mahabharata's Manipur.http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.opinions.The_Effects_of_Burning_of_Meitei_Puyas_By_Madhu_Chandra # http://kanglaonline.com/2010/10/burning-of-puya-commemorated-as-black-day- by-acoam/ # https://www.imphaltimes.com/it-articles/item/11938-historical- evaluation-of-puya-meithaba-a-contemporary-re-interpretation Pamheiba's forty-year reign marked the zenith of Meeteileipak in all aspects‚Äîreligious reform, military conquest, cultural and literary achievements and sound economics. He issued several coins during his reign engraved with his different names: ‚ÄòManipureswar‚Äô, ‚ÄòMekeleswar‚Äô, ‚ÄôGaribaniwaza‚Äô. He abdicated the throne in favour of his son Chit Sai (1748-52) in 1748 and was then driven out to Cachar by his brother Bharat Sai in 1752. Gourashyam (1753-58) ousted Bharat Sai in 1753 and ascended the throne. In 1758, the Burmese king Alaungpaya invaded Meeteileipak. *Meidingu Chingthang Khomba or Maharaja Bhagyachandra (1749-1798) In 1759, Gourashyam gave up the throne in favour of his brother Bhagayachandra who restored normalcy in the kingdom and tried to regain the lost glory of Meeteileipak/Kangleipak. In 1764, the new Burmese king Hsinbyushin invaded Manipur again through the Kabaw Valley. The Meitei force were defeated at Tamu and the king fled to the Ahom kingdom in Assam. He regained the throne of Kangleipak in 1768 with help of Ahom king Rajeshwar and went on to rule for more than 30 years, signing a treaty with East India Company in 1762. His reign was a landmark in the history of Meeteileipak for the propagation of Cheitanya's School of Vaishnavism. Afterward, Meeteileipak came more under the influence of Bengali language and literature. Bhagayachandra earned the title of \\"Rajarshi\\" as a king who had become a royal sage. Origin of Manipuri Classical Dance, Rasa lila According to Cheitharol Kumpaba, in February 1776, the king went to Kaina Hill in search of the jackfruit tree. Four images of Krishna were then carved from jackfruit wood. The ritual installation of Shri Govindajee was performed at the Rashmondal of Langthabal palace in 1780. The Meiteis worshipped God through dance as performed in the Lai Haraoba (Merry Making of God). As revealed in the dream, and with the help of his daughter Princess Bimbabati known as Shija Laioibi who was symbolically married and dedicated her life to Shri Govindajee, he composed the Rasa lila. Meidingu Chingthangkhomba dedicated three forms of Rasa lila to Krishna--Kunja Ras, Maha Ras and Basanta Ras. Anglo-Burmese events There were a number of wars during this era between the Meiteis, the Burmese and the British. *Meidingu Marjit (1813-1819) With help from the Burmese kingdom of Awa, Marjit invaded Kangleipak in 1813 where he defeated his brother Chaurajit. He then ascended the throne in 1813 and ruled for six years. Chahi Taret Khuntakpa, the Seven Years Devastation (1819-26) Main article: Seven Years Devastation of Manipur Meitrabak had never faced such catastrophe as that brought about by the Burmese conquest. The new king of Awa, Bagyidaw, invited Marjit to attend his coronation ceremony and to pay homage to him. Marjit refused to attend the coronation, which offended the Burmese king who then sent a large force under the command of General Maha Bandula to humble Marjit. Marjit was defeated and fled to Cachar. Meitrabak was then brought under the rule of Awa for the seven years between 1819 and 1826, which is known as Chahi Taret Kuntakpa in the history of Meitrabak. The flight of Marjit from Meitrabak and the conquest by Awa in 1819 marks the end of the mediaeval period in the history of Meitrabak. Meitrabak Princes in Cachar In the early nineteenth century, after being dislodged from Meitrabak, its princes made Cachar a springboard for the reconquest of the territory. In 1819, three brothers occupied Cachar and drove Govinda Chandra out to Sylhet. The kingdom of Cachar, divided between Govinda Chandra and Chaurajit in 1818, was repartitioned after the flight of Govind Chandra among the three Meitrabak princes. Chaurajit got the eastern portion of Cachar bordering Meitrabak which was ruled from Sonai. Gambhir Singh was given the land west of Tillain hill and his headquarters was at Gumrah, Marjit Singh ruled Hailakandi from Jhapirbond. *Meidingngu Gambhir Singh (1826-1834) With the 500-strong Meetei Levy and with help from the British East India Company, Gambhir Singh expelled the Burmese of Awa from Meitrabak beyond the Ningthi Turel (Chindwin River). He ruled the country from Langthabal and died on 9 January 1834 to be succeeded by his infant son Chandrakirti / Ningthem Pishak (1834-1844). *Meidingngu Nara Singh (1844-1850) He was the second cousin of Gambhir Singh and the regent. Kumidini, mother of Chandrakirti, was dissatisfied with the arrangement and fled to Cachar with her son. At the wish of the people of Meitrabak he ascended the throne in 1844 at the age of 51. He then shifted the capital from Langthabal to Kangla where he reconstructed the two statues of the Kangla Sha at Uttra made by Meidingngu Chaurajit and that the Burmese had dismantled and destroyed. Meidingngu Nara Singh died on 10 April 1850 and was succeeded by his brother Meidingngu Debendra Singh (1850). *Meidingngu Chandrakirti (1850-86) came from Cachar, defeated Debendra and regained the throne in 1850. During his reign, all the sacred and holy places inside Kangla were developed and maintained. Kangla thus became a well- fortified palace surrounded by five layers of defences, including the inner and outer moats, brick walls, as well as an earthen rampart and citadel surrounding the palace in the centre. He died on 20 May 1886. The Manipur Expedition The main entrance of the Kangla Fort in Imphal. Meidingngu Surchandra (1886-90) succeeded his father to the throne in 1886 when there were revolts against him led by Sana Borachaoba and Dinachandra that proved unsuccessful. However, on 21 September 1890, Princes Zila Ngamba and Angousana, with the support of Senapati Tikendrajit, revolted against Surchandra who abdicated and left Meitrabak for Brindaban (Vrindavan). His brother Kulachandra Singh ascended the throne in 1890 and Tikendrajit, the Senapati or supreme military commander of the armed forces of Manipur, became the ruler behind the scenes. Surchandra requested the government of India to reinstate him on the throne but the British decided to recognize Kulachandra as king of Meitrabak and to arrest Yuvraj Tikendrajit for having caused the palace revolution.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 186. Chief Commissioner of Assam, James Wallace Quinton, came to Manipur to execute the order of the Government of India with a 400-strong escort under the command of Colonel Charles Mac Donald Skene, D.S.O. This event led to The Anglo-Manipur War of 1891. On hearing the news, Meidingngu Kulachandra sent Kangabam Chidananda (Thangal General) with 700 Meitei sepoys to Mao Thana, a Meitrabak outpost on the border of Nagaland, then called the Naga Hills, to receive the Chief Commissioner of Assam and to make arrangements for a large escort for the Chief Commissioner.Antony Brett-James, \\"Disaster in Manipur\\" History Today (Jan 1962), Vol. 12 Issue 1, p48-55. On 22 March 1891, at about 10 a.m. Quinton arrived at Imphal with his escort. Meidingngu Kulachandra Dhaja and his younger brothers welcomed him at the western Gate of the Kangla Palace. Quinton informed Meidingngu Kulachandra that at noon there would be a Durbar (court) held at the Residency. Thus did Quinton attempt to apprehend Yuvraj Tikendrajit but he was not successful. Quinton then consulted the political agent Grimwood as well as Colonel Skene and decided to arrest Yuvraj forcibly. Grimwood was then speared to death and Quinton, Colonel Skene, Mr. Cossins, Lieutenant Simpson and Bulger were subsequently beheaded by the public executioner in front of the Kangla Sha. As soon as the news of the failure of the plan to arrest Yuvraj Tikendrajit and the execution of the British officers reached the Government of India, three columns of troops, known as the Manipur Expedition, were sent to Meitrabak from Kohima, Silchar and Tamu under the command of Major General Henry Collett, Col. R.H.F. Rennick and Brigadier General T. Graham, respectively. The column moving in from Tamu faced the strongest resistance from Meitrabak and major hand-to-hand combat took place at Khongjom on 25 April. Maipak Sana, Wangkheirakpa, Yengkhoiba, Chongtha Miya, Paona Brajabasi, Khumbong Major, Wangkhei Meiraba, Chinglen Sana, Loitongba Jamadar, Keisam Jamadar, Heirang Khonja and a number of Meitei soldiers died on the battlefield. Meitrabak lost its independence to the British on 27 April 1891. The British government selected Meidingngu Churachand Singh (1891-1941), minor son of Chaobiyaima as the king of Meitrabak. A new Kangla Palace was constructed at Wangkhei and Kangla was kept under British occupation. During British colonial rule, Kangla was known as Manipur Fort and a battalion of Assam Rifles was stationed there. Noted Meitei writer, M. K. Binodini Devi (1922-2011) was the youngest daughter of the ruler. World War II World War II came to Manipur with the bombing of Imphal, the capital of Manipur by the Japanese air force. The first bombing was on 10 May 1942, causing many civilian casualties. Another air raid occurred on 16 May 1942. A major thrust by the Empire of Japan in 1944 was stopped at Imphal by British and Indian forces. This marked the furthest westward expansion of the Empire. The British left Manipur in 14 August 1947 one day before Indian independence. Manipur became an independent country till 15 October 1949 when it was merged into India following the Shillong Merger Agreement.

Biography=Early life Meade was born in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales. His parents, John and Phyllis (n√©e Watts) were joint masters of the Curre Hounds at Itton and set up Britain's first Connemara stud. He was educated at Lancing College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read Engineering and was a member of the Hawks' Club. He served in the 11th Hussars and briefly worked in the City of London before embarking on a life committed to the equestrian sphere.Richard Meade. sports-reference.com Equestrian career Throughout his eventing career Meade was the outstanding rider of his time and the lynchpin of British teams for 21 years.

Biography Allday was born in 1957 in Huntsville, Texas. When he was one year old, his mother and father moved to Maryland, where they had bought a horse farm that included Thoroughbreds, Quarter Horsess, and show horses. It was here that he became accustomed to working with and taking care of horses, including assisting veterinarians who were occasionally called in.

A scaled-down version for the Sega Genesis was released in 1990 by Electronic Arts, and in 1993 it was released for the Apple Macintosh System 7 by Bethesda Softworks. Plot Set in a medieval fantasy world, Lordan is the ruler of the northern kingdom. Zoras, an evil necromancer, is in his tower made of human bones, planning to make a second attempt to overthrow Lordan, after his first attempt was defeated by Sodan, the hero. Zoras studied ancient parchments where he learned to experiment with long forgotten spells. His new knowledge enabled him to conjure all kinds of nightmarish creatures, which he sent marching towards Lordan's castle, leaving a path of death and destruction. To protect his twin children, son Brodan and daughter Shardan, Lordan arranged for them to be taken from the castle across the Cthol mountains to the farthest corner of the land. After Lordan's defeat and death at Zoras' hands, his children were raised by an old, bitter man, who also trained them in the art of sword combat. Before they start their journey to defeat Zoras, the old man hands over to them the sword of Sodan. Armed with the sword, they fight their way to castle Craggamoor and face the tyrannical Zoras. After they defeat Zoras, the people accept them as the true rulers and saviors of the land.Summarized from the Amiga manual Gameplay=Amiga Amiga screenshot There are two playable characters: Brodan or his twin sister Shardan, whose gameplay characteristics are identical despite their physical differences. The character walks in a horizontally scrolled world from left to right, defeating enemies with their sword, wielded either standing or kneeling. Though the player is also equipped with a shield, it is merely for decoration. It was completely removed from the Sega Genesis version. Before each level starts, a map appears, showing the player's progress through the land on their way to castle Craggamoor. Scrolls give additional information about the current location. Once the player enters the castle, the map is replaced by a gloomy picture of an outside view of the castle. Most of the levels consist of simply fighting enemies with the sword, but sometimes the player must avoid traps or solve puzzles. The player starts with five lives, an energy meter and a hit strength level. A player's energy is reduced every time they are hit by enemies, but their hit strength can be increased by using potions. There are different types of potions. Some increase hit strength, some give an extra life, some provide short-term invincibility, while still others kill the current opponent immediately. There are eleven different areas, five in the area surrounding the castle, and six within. The player starts at their own city gate, and progresses through the countryside towards the castle, passing through city streets, a forest and a graveyard. Once within the castle, the player wanders through catacomb-like levels, which lead to the wizard's tower at the end. The world is inhabited by 13 different enemies and a single supporting character, the ostrich-like creature called \\"the animal\\". Sega Genesis While the gameplay mechanic is very similar to the Amiga version, there are several differences. First, enemies attack from both directions, instead of the single direction in the Amiga game. Second, the player relies more regularly on potions, which are also dropped more frequently and can combined to achieve different effects. Third, the areas have been reduced from eleven to eight, with some completely deleted (e.g. the forest), while others combined. Finally, there are only eight enemies, as opposed to the thirteen in the Amiga game, however, the enemies are spawned more frequently, and in different areas. Development Sword of Sodan was created by three Danish engineers from Discovery Software in 1988. Two years later Innerprise Software, whom purchased the game rights, created a scaled-down port of for the Sega Genesis system which differs in reduced graphics and sound quality, as well as notable changes in overall gameplay. The Genesis port was published by Electronic Arts. The game was again ported in 1993 by Bethesda Softworks for the Apple Macintosh System 7. Unreleased Apple IIGS port A partially completed port for the Apple IIGS was advertised and shown at the CES Expo in 1989 by Visual Concepts, Ltd (then known as \\"Visionware\\"). Playable with a joystick, it was approximately 70% complete. Soon after, a three level self- playing demo was released and displayed in stores, virtually indistinguishable from the Amiga version in terms of graphics and animation fluidity. Originally set to be released in mid-1989, it was pushed back several months when its programmer, Scott Patterson, was fired for misconduct and a replacement had to be found. Programmer Jimmy Huey was eventually hired, however Discovery Software went bankrupt soon after in 1990. Despite these developments, appearing in magazines ads, on display in stores and the game being included on vendor's price lists, the port remained in limbo and never released. Nearly 30 years later, on May 26, 2018, the unreleased Apple IIGS port was unearthed and made public, revealing an entirely playable and very polished version of the game.http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/a-development-version-sword-of- sodan-is-now-archived-it-s-playable-although-bugs-remain-on-the-iigs-right- now/ It was revealed all levels are present, however four are missing enemy sprites‚Äìincluding the final boss stage. The Apple IIGS source code required to complete programming of the game has still yet to be found. Canceled sequel and other ports Ports for the IBM PC, Atari ST and the Commodore 64 systems were planned but never developed.Computer + Video Games 90 Magazine (Apr 1989) A sequel was developed but never released, however a single screenshot was shown in a magazine.http://www.playright.dk/screens/swordofsodan2_ami_01.jpg Reception According to programmer S√∏ren Gr√∏nbech's homepage, Sword of Sodan on the Amiga was at the top 10 selling charts for more than six months and selling about 55,000 copies. Due to the violent nature of the game, it was indexed by the German BPjS/BPjM in 1989. The original 1988 release for Amiga got mostly favorable reviews by the magazines, with praise for the graphics, which included large, detailed sprites, unusual for that time. However, the budget re-release in 1993 was met with negative reviews. For the Sega version, websites like I-Mockery.com or Somethingawful.com mocked the game for its bad graphics, annoying sound effects, frustrating controls and difficult gameplay.

History In 2004, Justin Greaves, previously drummer of several doom and sludge bands like Iron Monkey, Electric Wizard and Teeth Of Lions Rule The Divine, began recording on acoustic guitars some primitive sounds he had in mind for years. He was encouraged by Dominic Aitchison of Mogwai, and their ideas would lay the backbone for Crippled Black Phoenix. The name of the band was taken from the lyrics (by Johnny Morrow of Iron Monkey) of \\"Big Loader,\\" a song on the debut album Iron Monkey. Greaves even used \\"Crippled Black Phoenix\\" as a pseudonym. The musicians centered around the main songwriter Greaves used to play in other bands, including Iron Monkey, Gonga, Mogwai, Electric Wizard, Hearts of Black Science and many others. Greaves and the band write what they call \\"endtime ballads\\" signifying both the melodic but slightly macabre nature of their songs and their unusual blend of styles, as the final evolution in music. This blend has led to them being called everything from progressive rock to dark folk, to psychedelic, to post rock/metal.Artist listing: Crippled Black Phoenix from Drowned in Sound Initially the band was produced by Geoff Barrow of Portishead fame, under his label Invada Records. Barrow occasionally played live in the first appareances of the band in 2007. Crippled Black Phoenix have made live shows a focus and have performed onstage - usually in a formation from 7 to even 9 members - also in peculiar venues, using folk and Victorian-era instruments in tandem with their rock elements. The innate, ever ongoing evolution of Crippled Black Phoenix has reflected on multiple turnovers in his line-ups, both studio and live. Of the first versions of the band, the most relevant changes were the departures of original singer/guitarist Joe Volk, who embarks in a solo career (2012) and guitarist Karl Demata (2014), who later founds the band Vly together with also departing bassist Christian Heilmann. Justin Greaves and Demata have been engaged in a legal dispute over the registered trademark of the band's name. In the second half of 2015 the issue with former guitarist was resolved and mastermind Greaves could continue his run under the monicker Crippled Black Phoenix, following his vision and continuing to be very prolific with different incarnations of the band and his cast of rotating musicians. A new phase of CBP started already in 2013 with the arrival of Swedish guitarist/vocalist Daniel Anghede: a voice that Greaves confesses to have always wanted to work with, at the point he was supposed to be on the debut album of the band. As a parallel project, female singer Belinda Kordic and Greaves formed the duo Se Delan. A second project involving Greaves and Kordic is called World War. Another major change on CBP path happens in 2019, when Daniel Anghede leaves the band after six years. He later announces a project (\\"Venus Principle\\") in a sort of CBP spin-off with other former bandmates. Greaves announces in the summer of 2020 the start of a new era of the band, continuing temporarily with a main core of 4 members while in search of a new singer. A brand new album, Elleng√¶st was announced to be released in October 2020, featuring several guest vocalists.

Critically, accreditation is not just about standard-setting: there are analytical, counseling and self-improvement dimensions to the process. There are parallel issues in evidence-based medicine, quality assurance and medical ethics (see below), and the reduction of medical error is a key role of the accreditation process. Hospital accreditation is therefore one component in the maintenance of patient safety. However, there is limited and contested evidence supporting the effectiveness of accreditation programs. Broadly speaking, there exist two types of hospital accreditation: #Hospital and healthcare accreditation which takes place within national borders #International healthcare accreditation. Background Hospitals and healthcare services are vital components of any well-ordered and humane society, and will indisputably be the recipients of societal resources. That hospitals should be places of safety, not only for patients but also for the staff and for the general public, is of the greatest importance. Quality of hospitals and healthcare services is also of great interest to many other bodies, including governments, NGOs targeting healthcare and social welfare, professional organisations representing doctors, patient organisations, shareholders of companies providing healthcare services, etc. However, accreditation schemes are not the same thing as government-controlled initiatives set up to assess healthcare providers with only governmental objectives in mind - ideally, the functioning and finance of hospital accreditation schemes should be independent of governmental control. How quality is maintained and improved in hospitals and healthcare services is the subject of much debate. Hospital surveying and accreditation is one recognised means by which this can be achieved. It is not just an issue of hospital quality. There are financial factors as well. For example, in the USA, up until recently the Joint Commission exercised a de facto veto over whether or not US hospitals and other health providers were able to participate, and therefore earn from, the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This situation has changed in recent years. National schemes Accreditation schemes recognised as providers of national healthcare accreditation services include: * Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) - based in the United States * American Accreditation Commission International (AACI) - based in the United States * CHKS Ltd is a specialist provider of healthcare accreditation programmes based in the UK and accredited to ISQua and ISO 17021:2011 standards www.chks.co.uk *The Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa www.cohsasa.co.za * Malaysian Society for Quality in Health, or MSQH - based in Malaysia * QHA Trent Accreditation - based in the UK-Europe * The National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (NSQHS Standards) developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) * Australian Council for Healthcare Standards International, or ACHSI - based in Australia * Accreditation Canada, formerly known as Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation, or CCHSA - based in Canada * Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP) -based in the United States * The Joint Commission (TJC) - based in the United States * Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) - based in the United States * Accreditation Commission for Health Care Inc.

They also vary considerably in terms of the cost incurred by hospitals and healthcare institutions. They have varying degrees of commitment to assessing medical ethical standards and clinical standards. International schemes Some accreditation schemes also undertake international healthcare accreditation work outside of their base country. One of the large number of accreditation schemes in the United States, the Joint Commission (TJC) currently being the best known, has created Joint Commission International, or JCI. In recent years, DNV have been challenging TJC in the USA. Accreditation Canada accredited its first organization internationally in 1967 in Bermuda . In 2010, Accreditation Canada International (ACI ) is created to provide accreditation to hospitals, clinics, primary care centers and health systems. Acreditas Global (formerly AAAHC International) is present in Peru since 2012 and Costa Rica. The former Trent Accreditation Scheme (TAS) from the UK was the first to accredit a hospital in Asia, in Hong Kong in 2000 , and QHA Trent Accreditation from the UK have continue to work in the same field. Since TAS started the process, others, such as JCI and ACI, have entered the market. DNV Healthcare is a Norwegian-US health care accrediting organisation providing a quality management system constructed in accordance with ISO 9001 and approved by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CHKS Ltd is a specialist international provider of healthcare accreditation programmes based in the UK and accredited to ISQua and ISO 17021:2011 standards www.chks.co.uk AACI is an international accreditation provider based in Hendersonville,NC,USA and accredited to ISQua, as well as ISO 17021:2015 standards www.aacihealthcare.com The Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA) is the only internationally accredited quality improvement and accreditation body for healthcare facilities in Africa. In the past 23 years over 600 facilities throughout the continent have entered the COHSASA program to improve the quality and safety of healthcare provided to patients. COHSASA holds a fourth consecutive accreditation by the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua), the global authority responsible for ensuring health accreditors themselves meet standards.

History The toponym, recorded in Domesday Book as Opopille, derives from the Old English uppan pylle, meaning \\"above the creek\\", referring to the mouth of the Axe. There is evidence of a port at Uphill since Roman times, probably for the export of lead from the Mendip Hills. The mouth of the River Axe is sheltered by Brean Down. The small quay at Uphill fell under the limited jurisdiction of the Port of Bristol, however it was a free port as it did not have the customs officers to collect revenues which were present at larger ports. In 1591 the captured French ship the Gray Honde from Bayonne was brought into Uphill, however; the normal trade from the 16th century was in livestock, brought from South Wales to be fattened on the local rich grassland. During the English Civil War the port was used to bring two regiments, about 1,500 men, of the Royalist Army from South Wales before the Battle of Langport. It continued as a small landing stage for many centuries including the import of coal and iron and the export of local produce. After the Enclosure Act of 1813 a public wharf was constructed for trade and was also used occasionally by passenger excursion ships. The Bristol to Exeter railway line runs through a steep cutting between Uphill and nearby Bleadon. This cutting is spanned by a high brick bridge known as \\"Devil's Bridge\\" and designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The former Bleadon and Uphill railway station served the village from 1871 until 1964. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. The parish became a civil parish in 1866. In 1933 the civil parish was abolished and absorbed into Weston-super-Mare.Vision of Britain website Geography Uphill is situated at the south end of Weston Bay, where the River Axe flows into the Bristol Channel, and was once a busy port. The Mendip Way long-distance footpath has its western trailhead at Uphill near the wharf. The village is dominated on its southern side by a large hill, the southern slope of which and the quarry at its western end form the Uphill Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest, notable for its species- rich calcareous grassland. It consists of species-rich calcareous grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids, Somerset Hair Grass (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort (Trinia glauca), and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) along with several species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea). The hill and Walborough common, which are adjacent to each other, are local nature reserves making a total area of . There are a range of flowers including cowslip, primrose and green-winged orchid. The Salt marsh has sea barley, slender hare's-ear and sea clover and limestone grassland with Somerset hair-grass, honewort, green-winged and early purple orchids. These attract redshank, dunlin, shelduck, black-tailed godwit, skylark, linnet, rock and meadow pipit. A tower on the hill is the remains of a 14th-century windmill. Religious sites Old Church of St Nicholas On top of the hill stands the unroofed Norman Old Church of St Nicholas. It is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The present day Church of St Nicholas is situated on lower ground towards the north end of the village. In addition, a separate Methodist Church is present in the village, located on Uphill Road South. Public services Uphill is home to Weston General Hospital.

In ordinary speech, an instant has been defined as \\"a point or very short space of time,\\" a notion deriving from its etymological source, the Latin verb instare, from in- + stare ('to stand'), meaning 'to stand upon or near.'Webster's New World College Dictionary, 4th ed. (1999), p. 740. The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by Aristotle in his Physics, where he wrote on Zeno's paradoxes. The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later. In physics, a theoretical lower-bound unit of time called the Planck time has been proposed, that being the time required for light to travel a distance of 1 Planck length. The Planck time is theorized to be the smallest time measurement that will ever be possible, roughly 10‚àí43 seconds. Within the framework of the laws of physics as they are understood today, for times less than one Planck time apart, one can neither measure nor detect any change. It is therefore physically impossible, with current technology, to determine if any action exists that causes a reaction in \\"an instant\\", rather than a reaction occurring after an interval of time too short to observe or measure. , the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 850 zeptoseconds (850 √ó 10‚àí21 seconds).

He was famed for his knack of organizing the civil service system efficiently, but his downfall began in 678, when he, over his objection, was put in command of an army against the Tibetan Empire and was defeated. He was removed from his post soon thereafter, and while he would return to imperial service, he would never regain the power he had.  Background  Li Jingxuan was born in 615, late in the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. His family was from what would become Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, roughly modern Bozhou, Anhui). His father Li Xiaojie (ÊùéÂ≠ùÁØÄ) served as the secretary general of Gu Prefecture (Á©ÄÂ∑û, part of modern Luoyang, Henan) during Sui's succeeding dynasty Tang Dynasty. Li Jingxuan was said to be studious in his youth, and was particularly well-studied in various traditional ceremonies. Late in the reign of Emperor Taizong, the chancellor Ma Zhou, knowing Li Jingxuan's talent, recommended him to be a resident scholar to study with Emperor Taizong's crown prince Li Zhi.As Li Zhi did not become crown prince until 643, and Ma Zhou died in 648, this event must have occurred between those years. He was allowed to study books in the imperial collection of books. It was said that Li Jingxuan appeared stern and arrogant, but was diligent in his duties. Both Ma and another official, Xu Jingzong, endorsed Li Jingxuan for his abilities.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 649, Emperor Taizong, and Li Zhi took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong). Li Jingxuan's activities during the earliest years of Emperor Gaozong's reign are not clear, but as of the early part of Emperor Gaozong's Qianfeng era (666-668), he was serving as a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (Ë•øËá∫, Xi Tai), as well as an imperial scholar. In 669, he was promoted to the post of Xi Tai Shilang (Ë•øËá∫‰æçÈÉé) -- the deputy head of the legislative bureau; he also carried additional titles as a staff member for Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Hong and acting deputy minister of civil service. He also received the designation of Tong Dong Xi Tai Sanpin (ÂêåÊù±Ë•øËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. He would serve as a chancellor for a decade, with his service only interrupted by his observance of a parent's (unclear which one) death in 670. It was said that one of Li's assistants, Zhang Renhui (Âºµ‰ªÅË§ò), was capable, and Li entrusted him to draft civil service regulations and forms, which Zhang did with skill. Zhang, however, overworked himself and died early from exhaustion. Li adopted the regulations and forms that Zhang drafted, and was able to make the civil service system more efficient than before, and it was said that since the start of Emperor Gaozong's reign, many officials had been in charge of civil service, but few were good at their duties, with Li being an exception and praised for his abilities. The reserve officials who visit Chang'an to request positions number in the thousands each year, and it was said that Li was capable of remembering their names and their strengths and weaknesses. The people were impressed with his memory and did not dare to deceive him. One particular example cited in by historians was one Xu Taixuan (ÂæêÂ§™ÁéÑ). Xu had, while serving as a prefectural official, encountered the situation where his colleague Zhang Hui (ÂºµÊÉ†) was due to be executed for receiving bribes. Xu knew that Zhang had an old mother, and therefore told the investigator that some of the bribes were his‚Äîthus decreasing the amount that Zhang was responsible for and causing him to be spared from death, but because of this, Xu was stuck at his position and not promoted for more than a decade. Li found out about this and was impressed with Xu's character, and so promoted him, earning Li praise for being a good judge of character when Xu eventually served with distinction. In 675, Li was formally made the minister of civil service and continued to serve as chancellor as well. In 676, Li was made Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) -- the head of the legislative bureau, which by this time was renamed Zhongshu Sheng (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ) -- a post considered one for a chancellor. Emperor Gaozong also created him the Duke of Zhao. Li, having been in charge of civil service for a long time, had many people trying to endear themselves to him. All three of his marriages were to daughters of prominent clans, and he was recognized by another prominent clan, the Li clan of the former Zhao Commandery, as a member. Because of this, he began to favor the prominent clans in his selections, drawing displeasure from Emperor Gaozong, but Emperor Gaozong did not outwardly disapprove. However, in 678, his discordant relationship with another chancellor, Liu Rengui, would eventually begin his downfall. Liu, who had been a major general before becoming chancellor, had been sent to Taohe Base (Ê¥ÆÊ≤≥Ëªç, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) to defend against Tufan attacks and to plan a counterattack, but suggestions that he submitted from Taohe were often blocked by Li. To retaliate, Liu, while knowing that Li had no military talent, nevertheless submitted a proposal to Emperor Gaozong that stated that Li would make the best possible general for the coming military action against Tufan, and when Li declined, Emperor Gaozong responded, \\"If Liu Rengui told me to go, I would go; how can you not go?\\" Emperor Gaozong had Li take over Liu's post at Taohe. In fall 678, Li's forces engaged those of the Tufan general Gar Trinring Tsendro (\\"Lun Qinling\\" (Ë´ñÊ¨ΩÈôµ) in Chinese) and suffered a great defeat, and even Li's deputy Liu Shenli (ÂäâÂØ©Á¶Æ) was captured by Tufan forces. Li himself might have been captured if not for a disruptive counterattack that the general Heichi Changzhi launched to disrupt the Tufan pursuit, and Li was able to withdraw back to Taohe. After returning to Taohe, Li made repeated requests to return to Chang'an, claiming that he was ill and needed treatment. In 680, Emperor Gaozong recalled him to Chang'an, but found out that not only was Li not ill, but that Li, upon returning to Chang'an, immediately went to the legislative bureau to resume his duties. Emperor Gaozong was incensed, and demoted him to the post of prefect of Heng Prefecture (near modern Hengyang in Hunan). After some time, he was promoted slightly to be the secretary general to the commandant at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). He died in 682 and was posthumously honored, including with the honorable posthumous name of Wenxian (ÊñáÊÜ≤, meaning \\"civil and knowledgeable\\"). His brother Li Yuansu later served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian.

Originally intended to connect the Susquehanna Valley with Tyrone and the ore lands to its northeast, it was built in two discontinuous and never-connected pieces, one from Tyrone to Fairbrook and one from Lewisburg to Lemont. These served as lightly trafficked branches of the PRR into the early 20th Century. The line from Tyrone to Fairbrook passed into the hands of the short line Bellefonte Central Railroad in 1927, but the PRR's manipulations ensured its abandonment in 1941. The line between Lewisburg and Lemont was severed in 1970 and was gradually cut further back towards Montandon. Regular service ended on the last remaining part of the line in 1997, and it was abandoned in 2008. Lewisburg, Centre and Spruce Creek The Lewisburg, Centre and Spruce Creek Railroad was chartered on April 1, 1853, to run westward from the vicinity of Lewisburg, on the west bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, through the southern valleys of Centre County, Pennsylvania to Spruce Creek, on the main line of the PRR. Its charter was amended on March 3, 1854, allowing it to reach the PRR at Tyrone, a town more industrially developed than Spruce Creek. Funding was hard to come by, and construction slow in starting. During the mid-1860s, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad considered building a line to Bellefonte to reach the LC&SC;, and then use the LC&SC; to reach the Catawissa Railroad. The plan fell through, but it drew the attention of the PRR to a potential competitor. The railroad was leased to the PRR on July 23, 1869, and it was the PRR that would provide support for construction and operate the railroad. By the next year, the railroad had been opened from Montandon, on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad east of the Susquehanna, across the river into Lewisburg. In 1871, it was open as far west as Mifflinburg, about up the Buffalo Valley. The company continued grading west towards Laurelton and did some work on the line east of Tyrone, but the Panic of 1873 slowed construction again. However, by 1877, the railroad had pushed its line through the narrow valley of Penns Creek to Rising Springs (now Spring Mills). The twisting line required two tunnels, through Paddy Mountain and Tunnel Mountain, cutting across loops in the winding course of Penns Creek through the mountains and extending its total length to . On December 13, 1879, the company defaulted on its bonds, and on December 31, 1879, it was reorganized as the Lewisburg and Tyrone Railroad. The new company was leased to the PRR as well on January 1, 1880. Lewisburg and Tyrone For the time being, the controlling PRR saw little prospect of traffic from completing the railroad. The projected western division of the Lewisburg and Tyrone, however, had considerable promise. A line east from Tyrone to Scotia and the surrounding iron ore region held great potential, particularly when Andrew Carnegie invested in the Scotia deposits. The new line left the PRR main line just east of Tyrone, in the Brush Mountain narrows of the Little Juniata River, and followed Logan Spring Run north to Eyer. Ambling up the broad valley between Bald Eagle Mountain and Tussey Mountain, it turned southeast at Marengo to pierce Gatesburg Ridge by the gap of Halfmoon Creek, which it followed to Spruce Creek below Pennsylvania Furnace. Running north along Spruce Creek and then the Beaver Branch, it ended in a station near Fairbrook by 1881, in all. No further construction in the direction of State College and the eastern division was undertaken, but the Scotia Branch swung through another gap in Gatesburg Ridge and ran another to reach the vast ore pits of Scotia. In 1882, another short line of , the Juniata Branch, was built off of the Scotia Branch just north of Gatesburg Ridge to reach ore pits of the Juniata Mining Company west of Scotia. The PRR began to extend the Lewisburg and Tyrone again in 1884, laying rail west from Spring Mills along Sinking Creek and then out across Penns Valley to Centre Hall and Oak Hall, from which the new line followed Spring Creek to Lemont. The new line, long, was opened in 1885. However, it was not now intended to reach the western division. Instead of connecting Lemont and Fairbrook, the PRR incorporated a new company, the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, to build a line from Lemont to the PRR-owned Bald Eagle Valley Railroad at Bellefonte. The new line, from Montandon to Bellefonte (and on to Milesburg via the Bald Eagle Valley) became the Bellefonte Branch of the PRR, while the disconnected western division was operated as the Fairbrook Branch. Several tributary branches were also built from the Lewisburg and Tyrone where it cut through the mountains. In 1880, a short branch was laid along Poe Creek to reach a sawmill at Poe Mills. After the area had been timbered and the sawmill burned, the branch was removed in 1904. Later years and abandonment The Lewisburg and Tyrone Railroad continued to operate as a PRR subsidiary. On June 16, 1913, it was again foreclosed on, and reorganized on December 30, 1915 as the Lewisburg and Tyrone Railway. However, in just over a year, on April 30, 1915, it was merged into the PRR. The two divisions continued to operate as the Fairbrook Branch and the Bellefonte Branch. The Juniata Branch was removed before 1920, and the Fairbrook and Scotia Branches were abandoned in 1927. The Bellefonte Central Railroad received permission to take over the Fairbrook Branch, building down from State College along the likely route of the unbuilt middle division of the L&T;, but the PRR's manipulation of rate divisions ensured that the Bellefonte Central could not operate the branch except at a loss. It was embargoed in 1933, and rail was removed in 1941‚Äì1942, after a long series of unsuccessful legal proceedings by the Bellefonte Central. Between 1923 and 1945, there was one significant addition to the former Lewisburg and Tyrone line: the Laurelton Branch was built north from Rutherton Station to serve Laurelton State Village, a state home for the mentally retarded. In 1970, Penn Central abandoned the middle of the Bellefonte Branch from Mifflinburg to Coburn, a section by then bereft of traffic potential. A short section of that has since become the Penns Creek rail trail. Further damage by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 resulted in the abandonment of the line from Lemont to Coburn. The remaining segment, from Montandon to Mifflinburg, was operated by Conrail until 1981. In 1983, Conrail sold it to the West Shore Railroad. In 1988, the West Shore bought part of the old Reading line across the river, including a bridge at Milton and abandoned the now-redundant line from Lewisburg to Montandon. Service ended on the line in 1997, and damage from Hurricane Floyd in 1999 rendered it impassable. Its acquisition for a rail trail in 2008 marked the end of railroading on the Lewisburg and Tyrone. Construction on the Buffalo Valley Rail Trail began in March 2011 and the first phase of construction, from Lewisburg to Mifflinburg, was completed at the end of November 2011. An expansion of the trail east in Lewisburg from 12th Street to 5th Street is dependent on approval by PennDOT for a proposed at-grade signalized crossing of Route 15.

It is an amide of pelargonic acid (n-nonanoic acid) and vanillyl amine. It is present in chili peppers, but is commonly manufactured synthetically. It is more heat-stable than capsaicin. Nonivamide is used as a food additive to add pungency to seasonings, flavorings, and spice blends. It is also used in the confectionery industry to create a hot sensation, and in the pharmaceutical industry in some formulations as a cheaper alternative to capsaicin. Like capsaicin, it can deter mammals (but not birds or insects) from consuming plants or seeds (e.g. squirrels and bird feeder seeds).http://www.aversiontech.com/hot-and-spicy/nonivamide- pava/Retrieved 16 July 2010 This is consistent with nonivamide's role as a TRPV1 ion channel agonist. Mammalian TRPV1 is activated by heat and capsaicin, but the avian form is insensitive to capsaicin. Nonivamide is used (under the name PAVA) as the payload in \\"less-lethal munitions\\" such as the FN Herstal's FN 303 projectiles or as the active ingredient in most pepper sprays, which may be used as a chemical weapon.Rohini J. Haar, Vincent Iacopino, Nikhil Ranadive, Sheri D. Weiser & Madhavi Dandu, Health impacts of chemical irritants used for crowd control, BMC Public Health (2017), 17: 831. As a chemical irritant, pepper sprays have been used both as a riot control munition and also a weapon to disperse peaceful demonstrators; they have also been used in other contexts, such as military or police training exercises. While irritants commonly cause only \\"transient lacrimation, blepharospasm, superficial pain, and disorientation,\\" their use and misuse also presents serious risks of more severe injury and disability. Treatment There are various treatments to combat the effects of nonivamide. One popular method includes administering a one-to-one solution of Milk of Magnesia and water to the eyes. Doctors also recommend not using oils or creams on the skin and to not wear contacts if one expects to encounter nonivamide.

He became involved in popular music after meeting a local musician who taught him how to play guitar.  Early life  Vargas was born in 1961 in Las Matas de Santa Cruz in the Monte Cristi province. He grew up in a poor household. He became involved in bachata music after meeting a local musician who taught him how to play guitar. He developed his style with influences from Blas Dur√°n and Eladio Romero Santos.  Music career  Vargas entered onto the bachata scene in the early 1980s. He was one of the first bachata artists to go into the Latin mainstream. Vargas is credited as the first bachatero to use guitar pedals, who he got the idea from bachata sound engineer Rafael Montilla. Montilla added a chorus pedal to Vargas guitar while recording his album El Maiz in 1991. He is also credited as the first bachatero to implement the use of humbucker pickups on acoustic electric guitars. Luis Vargas self-produced, promoted and sold his first albums in the early 1980's. Supported by local artists Pedro Pimentel, Artemio S√°nchez, and Antonio Carrasco, his music began being played by local radio stations. After issuing his music through an independent label called Jos√© Luis Records, Sony Discos (now Sony Music Latin) signed him in 1996, releasing Volvio el Dolor in 1997. He is the first bachata artist signed to Sony Music Latin. Antony Santos, considered by some to be one of the most influential bachata musicians of all time, was his g√ºira player. Vargas was Santos guitar mentor. After Santos left Vargas group to form his own, they soon became rivals. They even released diss tracks to one another. Songs like \\"El Envidioso\\", \\"El Brazo Largo\\", \\"El Gato Seco\\", \\"El Charlatan\\", among others. Vargas became famous for his guitar licks and doble sentido (double play) on words. He is known as El Rey Supremo de la Bachata, not to be confused with Aventura, Los Reyes de la Bachata Moderna. Aventura has credited Luis Vargas as one of the groups inspirations, although they had conflicts with Vargas in the past.

It is black, with white forequarters. In Britain it was amalgamated with the Essex pig to form the British Saddleback, and it is extinct as a separate breed in Britain. However, the Wessex Saddleback survives in Australia and New Zealand. Description The Wessex Saddleback is black, with a white band about the forepart of the trunk, extending from one fore-foot over the shoulder to the other, forming a white band resembling a saddle (or \\"sheet\\"). It is a tall, rangy animal, adapted to foraging in woodland, its traditional use. This use survived longest in the New Forest, where pigs are still allowed to forage in woods for mast (acorns, beech-nuts and chestnuts) ‚Äì but the New Forest pigs no longer include pure-bred Wessex Saddlebacks. History There is some confusion about the origin of the Wessex Saddleback. Some sources state that it began as a cross of \\"the black breed of the New Forest\\" and \\"the Old English Sheeted breed\\", spreading through Hampshire and the Isle of Purbeck in the 18th century.Malden, W J, \\"The Wessex Saddleback Breed\\" (original publication unknown), reprinted in Saddleback Times 2:2, Summer 2005. However others simply say that the breed is \\"of unknown origin\\". The breed has been claimed to be one of the few British pig breeds to have been little affected by crossing with \\"Neapolitan\\" pigs of Far Eastern origin, and if this is true, it is perhaps one of those closest to the landrace pigs which foraged in woods throughout Britain for many centuries.Layley, George W and Malden, Walter James (1935), The Evolution of the British Pig: Past, present and future. London, J Bale & Co. (quoted in Hall, Stephen J G and Clutton-Brock, Juliet (1989), Two Hundred Years of British Farm Livestock, British Museum (Natural History), , p 210) The Wessex Saddleback breed society began in 1918 in Britain, but by the middle of the 20th century pig farming was becoming more and more intensive. The more extensive systems to which the Wessex is suited declined, and the breed declined with them. Meanwhile, the similarly coloured (but otherwise rather different) Essex had followed a similar course, and in 1967 the two breeds were merged in an effort to prevent both becoming extinct.Hall, Stephen J G and Clutton-Brock, Juliet (1989), Two Hundred Years of British Farm Livestock, British Museum (Natural History), , p 210 This formed a hybrid breed, the British Saddleback (confusingly, the name \\"Wessex Saddleback\\" is often used loosely in Britain for the British Saddleback). A few herds of Essex Pigs survived in a relatively pure form in Britain, and efforts are being made to revive them as a separate breed, but the Wessex is currently considered extinct in its country of origin. However, before amalgamation some Wessex Saddlebacks had been exported to other parts of the world, and the breed survives in small numbers in Australia,Fiona Chambers (2004) Status of Pig Breeds in Australia Rare Breeds Trust of Australia New Zealand,Wessex Saddleback Pigs: A Rare Breed of British Origin, Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand and perhaps elsewhere. In Australia in 2008 there are less than 100 registered breeding sows, and they are considered critically endangered by the Rare Breeds Trust of Australia. In the early 19th Century, similar pigs from Hampshire were exported to North America, and formed the basis of the Hampshire pig, one of the commonest commercial breeds there. The Hampshire has since been re-imported to Britain, but it is now of a different type to the Wessex. Uses Regarded as an excellent eating pig, the Wessex Saddleback was traditionally used as a \\"baconer\\" and grown out for bacon and hams.

The show is a parody of the BBC's children's television series Teletubbies, and it tries to envisage what this show would have looked like, had the Nazis won World War II. Nazit√ºbbies features the four colourful characters: Heinrich Himmler as Tinky Winky (actually Dipsy) (who is black instead of green), Joseph Goebbels as Dipsy (actually Laa-Laa) (who is gold instead of yellow), Hermann G√∂ring as Laa-Laa (actually Tinky Winky) (who is blue instead of purple) and Rudolf Hess as Po (who is brown instead of red). Named after the four Nazi leaders of the same name, they live in an underground air-raid shelter in a flowering meadow, and engage in various wholesome activities such as stealing Nazi gold from one another, marching their Alsatians, or learning how to goose-step under the command of the leading Nazit√ºbbie, Luftmarschall G√∂ring. Like the Teletubbies, the Nazit√ºbbies show short movieclips on TV-screens on their bellies. These clips are usually taken from Die Deutsche Wochenschau, a series of German newsreels running from 1940 until the end of World War II, often focusing on the accomplishments of Fritz Todt and the construction of the Autobahn. Adolf Hitler is frequently seen on the show, where he is pictured as the Sun shining down on the meadow. Every time he is shown, the sound of child-laughter can be heard in the background. The music score is a mixture of typical light-hearted children's TV music and military march music. The sketches open with Adolf Hitler as the sun rising over the meadow and the camera overlooking the air raid shelter with the narrator saying \\"The Nazit√ºbbies live at the great bunker in the green forest. They are having a real good time.\\" The Nazit√ºbbies then all run out of the bunker and then stand the way the Teletubbies stand in the opening sequence. But this time, they all stand up straight as the logo appears and disappears the way the Teletubbies logo does so. We then see a voice trumpet similar to the ones on Teletubbies and it says \\"Here Come the Nazit√ºbbies! Here Come the Nazit√ºbbies! Here Come the Nazit√ºbbies!\\" and the Nazit√ºbbies chant \\"Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!\\" and it then cuts to clips of the Nazit√ºbbies bumping tummies like in the Teletubbies opening, with clips of the Nazit√ºbbies knocking each other down and a clip of G√∂ring hitting Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler sitting on Hess and the latter wrestling the former and G√∂ring chasing Goebbels, as the narrator says the Nazit√ºbbies' names and as he says them, the camera zooms in on that Nazit√ºbby. The Nazit√ºbbies then sing \\"Nazit√ºbbies, Nazit√ºbbies! Heil! Heil! Heil!\\" and then running off. The sketches end with the voice trumpet saying \\"Now it's time for Nazit√ºbby bye-bye. Now it's time for Nazit√ºbby bye-bye.\\" The Nazit√ºbbies then all say \\"Bye-bye.\\" and then run into their house one by one as the narrator says \\"So long, Nazit√ºbbies. Have a good time until we meet again!\\" G√∂ring is the last Nazit√ºbby to go into the house and when he does, he closes the doors. But he then opens them again and says \\"Bye-bye.\\" and then closes the doors and laughing is heard. The talkshow den 11. time on which Nazit√ºbbies formerly appeared was broadcast until 2008 on Danmarks Radio, the national Danish public service broadcaster and on Kanal 5.

The first team play in the . History Although Northfield Town F.C. came into being in 1966, its origins go back to the early 1950s. After spells in the Kings Norton League, Warwickshire & West Midlands Alliance and the Mercian League, they joined the Combination in 1957 (then the Worcestershire Combination). Playing under the name of Allen's Cross they won the League Challenge Cup in their first year and the League Championship in 1961‚Äì62. Following amalgamation with another successful local side, Castle Rovers, the club played briefly as Cross Castle United before adopting the present title of Northfield Town. In 2013 Northfield Town F.C amalgamated with Shenley Radford Youth F.C to create a youth system. This was the beginning of Northfield Town Juniors F.C, with the teams competing in the Central Warwickshire Youth Football League. The 2013‚Äì14 season was the last season in the Midland Football Combination, in which Northfield Town finished 13th before entering the newly formed Midland Football League for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Northfield Town finished the 2016/17 season in 4th place in Midlands Division Three, narrowly missing out on promotion. The team also finished runners-up in the Challenge Vase, losing the final 2‚Äì1 to NKF Burbage. Also that season, the club twice broke its record for largest attendance, firstly against Paget Rangers when 101 people watched the game, and then again against Montpellier on the last day with an attendance of 124 people.  Club badge and colours  The Northfield Town F.C's Logo is based on the history of the club. The red cross represents Allen's Cross F.C and the castle represents Castle Rovers F.C who amalgamated to form Northfield Town F.C in 1966. The club used to wear black and white due to the amalgamation with Shenley Radford Youth F.C. However, for the start of the 2016/17 season they reverted to their yellow and blue kit, with the black and white strip being used as an away kit. Ground The home games for both Northfield Town F.C and Northfield Town Juniors F.C are played at Shenley Community Association and Sports Centre, based in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham. Kings Heath Old Boys F.C who play in the Birmingham & District Football League and Northfield Town S G F.C who play in the Coronation Football League & Alliance (formerly Shenley Green F.C) also pitch share at the Shenley Community Association and Sports Centre. The present sports ground was initially the playing fields for The Allens Cross Community Association and they remained the \\"parent body\\" until 1983. The field was opened in 1935; that year King George V and Queen Mary were celebrating the Silver Jubilee of their reign to mark the event a fund was set up, called the King George V Playing Fields Fund. At Allen's Cross funds were also obtained from the Birmingham Branch of the National Playing Fields Association, the Birmingham Civic Society, Bournville Village Trust and other donors. Eventually, in 1937, work started on a clubhouse pavilion, provided by the Feeney Trust, tarmac tennis court and caretaker's house, all of which were officially opened on 27 August 1938 by George Cadbury. The ground itself was laid out for two football pitches and one cricket pitch. When Cadburys formed a partnership with Schweppes in the early 1970s, three of their properties, the Allens Cross Sports ground, Weoley Hill Cricket and Tennis Club and the Cadbury Club in Bournville Lane, were allowed to have a bar. The sports club then went from strength to strength while the Community Hall was struggling and in the red. In 1983 the committee from the sports ground requested to break away from Allens Cross Community Association. Discussions took place and Chris Cadbury, President of the Association, reluctantly agreed on the understanding that they became a Community Association. With that, the sports ground \\"broke\\" from the \\"parent body\\", Allen's Cross. It became a registered charity in its own right and was renamed Shenley Lane Community Association & Sports Centre. It originally comprised Northfield Town F.C, Allens Cross Cricket and Shenley Radford Youth Club. From this time cricket was the longest surviving sports group at the ground. Allen's Cross Cricket Club ran from 1938 to 2002. In the latter years they survived by recruiting many immigrant cricketers of considerable ability, but these had no permanent connection with the association and the club folded completely in 2002. Cricket is still played regularly at Shenley Lane by a number of local clubs. At the same time a development plan was put into place and with the help of the Prince's Trust a brand new changing block, entrance, stand and toilets were added. Later an all-weather pitch was built. Various developments have taken place over recent years, most significantly the security fencing, but are usually limited to \\"refurbishments\\" due to limited funds.

In January 2019, Metal Slug XX was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam. Story Two years following the events of Metal Slug 4, the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force, the SPARROWS, and the Ikari Warriors are once again on a search for General Morden and his army, this time on a giant island landfill that has been converted into a military fortress, in order to stop his latest coup d'√©tat. After having his newest weapon crushed by the heroes, Morden receives unexpected help when a time portal opens up and high-tech soldiers from the future appear to pledge their support. With their advanced technology, Morden is able to further fortify his base, but the heroes push forward despite the incredible odds. At the very end, the heroes are able to destroy the time portal and cut off the Rebel Army's suppliers. Morden escapes in a giant mechanical Kraken and confronts them over a lake of molten lava. After a long and arduous battle, Morden is defeated and his weapon begins to sink into the lava. The heroes capture Morden and escape via helicopter, but he escapes when the Martians attack the helicopter. The final scene shows the heroes chasing Morden and his men off into the sunset. Gameplay There are seven levels and three difficulties: Beginner, Normal and Hard. Metal Slug 7 uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen as a map of the level, making it easier for the player to look at the level and where to get power ups or captured prisoners. The usual weapons make their return from the series including a new weapon called \\"Thunder Shot\\", which fires a homing electric blast to the enemy. New to Metal Slug XX is downloadable content which includes the addition of Leona Heidern from The King of Fighters series as a playable character. Soundtrack The music in the game was composed by Toshikazu Tanaka, following on from his work on Metal Slug 4, Metal Slug 5, and Metal Slug 3D. Reception Metal Slug 7 received mixed to positive reviews. GameZone's Steven Hopper gave the PSP version a 7 out of 10, saying \\"If you are a hardcore Metal Slug fan (and there are many out there) then this is a good portable fix. It controls well and offers up plenty of action. The campaign is super-short (clocking in at a little under an hour from start to finish), but this is a game that is meant to be played over and over again.

UN DESA assists countries around the world in agenda-setting and decision-making with the goal of meeting their economic, social and environmental challenges. It supports international cooperation to promote sustainable development for all, having as a foundation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice, and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and continues to play a key role in monitoring progress towards internationally agreed-upon development goals. It is also a member of the United Nations Development Group.  Background  UN DESA is part of the UN Secretariat, which is funded through regular assessed contributions from Member States. The Department was reorganized into its present form in 1997. The Department is headed by Liu Zhenmin who assumed the office of Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, following his appointment to this position by Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres on 26 July 2017. Mr. Liu advises the Secretary-General on the three pillars of sustainable development ‚Äì social economic and environmental, and nurtures key partnerships with governments, UN agencies and civil society organizations, including the SDGs. In directing and managing UN DESA, the Under-Secretary-General is supported by the Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.  Mission  UN DESA's mission is to promote sustainable development for all, focusing on the most vulnerable. This reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. It underscores the need for all stakeholders ‚Äì governments, UN and other international organizations, civil society and the private sector ‚Äì to do their part to improve economic and social well-being. This emphasis on equitable participation by all people and nations is what makes the United Nations unique and gives the development agenda its universal legitimacy.  Function  UN DESA's work programme can be categorized into three areas: Adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015 Norm-setting: By facilitating major global conferences and summits, as mandated by UN Member States, UN DESA assists countries as they find common ground and take decisive steps forward. Specifically, UN DESA is tasked with supporting deliberations in two major UN charter bodies: the UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), including ECOSOC's subsidiary bodies. In addition, UN DESA organises and supports consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. In this regard, UN DESA's main priorities are promoting progress toward and strengthening accountability in achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, UN DESA is responsible for ensuring civil society engagement with the UN through the ECOSOC bodies.

The research and analytical work covers a range of economic, social and environmental issues. The Department produces a host of flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports, which are essential to UN negotiations and global policy decisions. The publications are distributed in print and electronic formats around the world. Capacity-building: UN DESA also advises Member States / Governments on implementing the policies and programmes developed at UN conferences back in their home countries. It assists interested Governments in translating policy frameworks developed in UN conferences and summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities. Divisions Economic Analysis and Policy Division: The Economic Analysis and Policy Division is the think-tank for development economics within DESA and the main development research unit within the United Nations. The core functions of the Division include monitoring the global economic and social situation, promoting macroeconomic policy co-ordination and analyzing development trends to improve the implementation of the UN Development Agenda. It has recently been contributing an array of analyses and policy recommendations to the international debate on the global financial and economic crisis. The division is responsible for publishing the yearly World Economic Situation and Prospects and the World Economic Social Survey reports, as well as a monthly briefing on the world economic landscape. It is also host to the Committee for Development Policy, which monitors and benchmarks the Least Developed Countries. Division for Sustainable Development Goals: The Division for Sustainable Development Goals supports intergovernmental processes related to sustainable development at the UN and serves as the substantive secretariat to the High-level Political Forum on sustainable development. The Division provides leadership and catalyses action to promote and implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related 17 SDGs by conducting research and undertaking substantive analysis to inform policy making, providing capacity development, and facilitating UN inter-agency coordination and the engagement of Major Groups and other Stakeholders in the United Nations' work on sustainable development. The Division also houses a Unit that is mandated to support the further implementation of intergovernmental agreements related to the sustainable development of small island developing states (SIDS), including the SAMOA Pathway, the Mauritius Strategy for the further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.

Financing for Sustainable Development: The Financing for Sustainable Development Office provides support for sustained follow-up to the commitments contained in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, building upon the 2008 Doha Declaration and the 2002 Monterrey Consensus, in seven main areas: (i) domestic public resources; (ii) domestic and international private business and finance; (iii) international development cooperation; (iv) international trade as an engine for development; (v) debt sustainability; (vi) addressing systemic issues; and (vii) science, technology, innovation and capacity-building. The Addis Agenda also deals with data, monitoring and follow-up in its conclusion and establishes a dedicated and strengthened follow-up and review process for the financing for development (FfD) outcomes, and all the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Financing for Sustainable Development Office supports the FfD follow-up and review process, working with Member States, major institutional stakeholders, other relevant organizations, civil society, the business sector. SDG's on UN building Office of Intergovernmental Support and Coordination for Sustainable Development: The Office of Intergovernmental Support and Coordination for Sustainable Development provides substantive support and promotes consensus in the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly.

The Office also supports the General Assembly quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) and is the entry point for NGOs seeking consultative status with ECOSOC, through its support to the NGO Committee. Population Division: The Population Division in DESA is a world leader in demographic research. It prepares estimates and projections on matters such as total population, fertility, mortality, migration and urbanisation, which serve as reference for the UN system, many Governments, academics, the media and corporate users throughout the world. The Division is the substantive secretariat of the Commission on Population and Development and therefore monitors the implementation of the Programme of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and its follow-up commitments. It produces selected indicators related to the reproductive health targets of the Millennium Development Goals and assists the deliberations of the General Assembly in the area of international migration and development. Division for Inclusive Social Development: The Division for Inclusive Social Development assists governments and civil society organizations formulate social policies that foster more secure, just, free and harmonious societies. The Division works with development partners to promote the realization of a 'society for all', where all members, including older persons, youth, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and other often-marginalised groups all have equal say and equal participation. It provides the primary support and servicing to the Commission for Social Development, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Conference of State Parties to the convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Forum on Forests: The United Nations Forum on Forests Secretariat is the DESA focal point on all forest policy issues.

Language nests originated in New Zealand in the 1980s, as a part of the MƒÅori-language revival in that country. The term \\"language nest\\" is a translation of the MƒÅori phrase . In a language nest, older speakers of the language take part in the education of children through intergenerational language transference.  Europe = Estonia  There is only one language nest for V√µro working three days a week in Haanja and several initiatives, so called \\"language nest days\\" (keelepes√§p√§iv) that are working one day in week in 18 different kindergartens of V√µro area. V√µro language nest initiatives are organised by V√µro Institute.  Finland  There are language nests for Inari S√°mi, Skolt Sami, and the Karelian languages in Finland.  Russia  There is a language nest in Vielj√§rvi, Karjalan Tazavaldu (Vedlozero, the Republic of Karelia): Karjalan Kielen Kodi. Language nest is kielipez√§ in Karelian.  North America = Canada  A study in 2004 reported on two language nests in British Columbia: a Cseyseten (\\"language nest\\") at Adam‚Äôs Lake in the Secwepemc language, and a Clao7alcw (\\"Raven‚Äôs nest\\") at Lil‚Äôwat Nation in the Lil‚Äôwat language written about by Onowa McIvor for her Master's thesis. The First Peoples' Cultural Council in Canada provides grants to First Nations communities in British Columbia as part of the Pre-School Language Nest Program. In the Northwest Territories, there are language nests for each of the official Aboriginal languages, with more than 20 language nests in total.  United States  In Hawai'i, the Hawaiian-language equivalent, the P≈´nana Leo, has been running for 24 years and has also been successful in producing first-language speakers of Hawaiian. In Minnesota, the Enweyang Ojibwe Language Nest, started in 2009. In collaboration with UMD's College of Education and Human Services Professionals and Eni-gikendaasoyang, the Center for Indigenous Knowledge and Language Revitalization, the program targets 4-5 year olds in a half day session in the Duluth area. In North Dakota, Lak»ü√≥l‚Äôyapi Wah√≥»üpi, the Lakota Language Immersion Nest, opened on September 12, 2012. Full day schooling aimed at 3-year olds, with parents also receiving training to encourage at home efforts is key to this program.  Oceania = Australia  In August 2009, the Australian government pledged to pilot language nests as part of its National Indigenous Languages Policy. The first of five Aboriginal language and culture nests in New South Wales launched in 2013, although these are government service delivery centres and not immersion pre-schools.

Pedro Campa√±a (1503-1586) was a Flemish painter of the Renaissance period, mainly active in Italy and Spain. His actual name was Pieter de Kempeneer, translated into French as Champaigne, and was also known as Peter van de Velde.  Biography  Born in Brussels, he trained there with Bernard Van Orley. His early life appears to have been spent in Italy, where he carefully studied the paintings of Raphael, and declared himself as his pupil. In 1530 he was at work at some scene-painting, representing a triumphal arch to be erected on the occasion of the coronation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna, and he then left for Spain, on the advice, it is said, of Cardinal Domenico Grimani, and spent the rest of his life in that country, only returning to Brussels about 1563 or 1565. Between 1537 and 1562 he was associated with Luis de Vargas and the Italian sculptor Torregiano in establishing a school of painting in Seville, which eventually became the academy of the place; among the pupils educated in it was Morales. He painted for the monastery of St. Mary of Grace, Church of Santa Cruz, in the city, an altar-piece representing the Descent from the Cross (1548), which is now in the cathedral, having been removed there when the church fell into ruins. There are other works by the same painter in Seville Cathedral, especially two representing the Purification of the Virgin and the Resurrection, the impressive main retable of Santa Ana, and others in various churches of the city, such as San Isidoro, San Pedro, Santa Catalina, and San Juan de la Palma. One of his last works was the restoration and repainting of a chapel belonging to Hernando de Jaen, an important resident of Seville. Murillo requested that he be buried near Campa√±a's picture, and his burial took place in the Church of Santa Cruz, close underneath the Descent from the Cross, but the whole building was burned to the ground during the Napoleonic Wars, and the tomb perished.

The road is located entirely in the county of Lincolnshire and is single carriageway for almost its entirety. The road is approximately long. The road gets quite congested with holiday traffic during the summer. Lincoln to Horncastle Approach to Lincoln at North Greetwell The road begins outside Lincoln as part of the by-pass at the A46 roundabout with Nettleham Road (B1182). The road does not enter the borough of Lincoln, and begins in the parish of Nettleham in West Lindsey. Before the Lincoln Bypass was built (in stages) in the mid-1980s, the A158 historically went along Wragby Road (now the A15). Even earlier the A158 followed the northern end of Canwick Road, the former B1188, over Pelham Bridge since its opening in 1958, and along South Park Avenue which was also built in 1958, to meet the former A46 at St Catherine's. This was parallel to the former western section B1190. The A15 at the time followed the west of Lincoln town centre, then along Silver Street. It heads south-east for before reaching a roundabout where the A15 joins from the centre of Lincoln. From here the route heads north-east through the village of North Greetwell along a former Roman road, where it is the parish boundary between Nettleham to the north and Greetwell to the south, Nettleham and Reepham, then Sudbrooke and Reepham. It passes Sudbrooke to the south, where there is a crossroads, with the main road for Sudbrooke to the left, and Star Energy's Welton Gathering Centre (in Reepham) for the Welton oilfield (part of the East Midlands Oil Province). The Cherry Tree Cafe is at the junction. It passes to the south of Sudbrooke Park (a Scout camp site), and crosses the Lincoln to Grimsby railway in the parish of Barlings, next to the Oriental Express Restaurant (former Station Inn). At Langworth there is a crossroads for Scothern, to the left, and Barlings, to the right, and passes St Hugh's church and The George at Langworth. It crosses the Barlings Eau at Langworth Bridge and there is a left turn for Stainton by Langworth, and a right turn for Newball, and the Woodside Wildlife and Falconry Park.Woodside Falconry Further on in the parish of Stainton by Langworth, near Rand Wood, the B1399 heads north-east while the A158 changes direction and heads east to Wragby. In Bullington it passes Bullington Hall and in Rand, it passes Brown Cow Farm, and there is a left turn for Rand and Rand Farm Park.Rand Farm Park The Rand Group construction company was based there until October 2009 when it went into administration. It is briefly the parish boundary between Rand, to the north, and Goltho, to the south, and passes Goltho Gardens,Goltho Gardens with a teashop. Approaching Wragby it enters East Lindsey. Here it crosses the B1202 at traffic lights near the Turnor Arms then forks with the A157 which heads through the Lincolnshire Wolds to Louth. The A157 formerly followed the A158's current route to Lincoln, and the A158's western terminus was at Wragby before the 1940s. It passes the parish church of All Saints, and crosses the former Louth to Bardney Line. From here the route gets quite twisty then heads south-east around the south end of the Wolds. It crosses Stainfield Back at Langton Bridge, and passes through Langton by Wragby, where there is a left turn on a bend for Panton, then a right turn on a bend for Chambers Farm Wood,Chambers Farm Wood part of the Lincolnshire Limewoods nature reserve.Lincolnshire Limewoods At Hatton Bridge, it is the parish boundary between Langton by Wragby, to the west and Hatton, to the east. There are crossroads for Hatton, to the left, and another crossroads at the (unoccupied) New Midge Inn, where the road becomes the parish boundary with Minting to the south. At Baumber the B1225 joins from the north as the A158 continues towards in a more southerly direction towards the town of Horncastle. The B1190 and B1191 both join just outside Horncastle where the road crosses the A153. Horncastle to Skegness The A158 in Hagworthingham After leaving Horncastle the route heads east with the B1195 heading off later to Spilsby. Further on the road passes through the village of Hagworthingham. The road then reaches a roundabout with the A16 at Partney. Both roads used to go through Partney but now bypass it. The construction of this bypass was preceded by a significant archaeological investigation. The A158 continues east until reaching another roundabout with the A1028 which provides a short cut from the A16 further north. The B1196 also heads up to Alford from here. The A158 becomes dual-carriageway for from here until becoming single again through Gunby. The road then joins with the newly opened Burgh Bypass, before finally reaching Skegness where it terminates at a junction with the A52 ReferencesExternal links * SABRE Roads Category:Roads in England Category:Roads in Lincolnshire Category:West Lindsey District Category:East Lindsey District ","title":"A158 road"},{"id":"13372380","text":"The Birmingham Ladywood by-election of 18 August 1977 was held after Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Brian Walden resigned in order to concentrate on his career as a journalist and broadcaster.

A former British colony, it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1960 and became a Commonwealth republic in 1961. The Republic of Cyprus is a developed country and has been a member of the European Union since 1 May 2004.  Status of the Republic of Cyprus  The Republic of Cyprus is an internationally recognised sovereign country, a portion of which is under foreign military occupation by Turkey. The occupation, which began on 20 July 1974 and continues to the present day, has been in direct contradiction with a number of passed resolutions of the UN Security Council.  Armed Forces of the Republic of Cyprus  The Republic of Cyprus is protected by a combined arms force known as the Cypriot National Guard. This force comprises land, air, naval and Special Forces units, within a highly organised and modernised structure of command, control and communication. The Cypriot National Guard performs a variety of military exercises, usually involved in the combined-arms role rather than favouring individual units. The largest military exercise is named Nikiforos-Toxotis, and this is the main annual war games of the Republic of Cyprus, with cooperation from the Hellenic armed forces.  Nikiforos-Toxotis  The Nikiforos-Toxotis exercise is typically held on an annual basis, though on several occasions, it has been cancelled for political reasons. The exercise involves the mobilisation of all active forces and the majority of first-line reserve forces, as well as elements of the second-line forces and Home Guard. Participating units are usually instructed to implement live-fire practice of their associated armaments as part of an organised training program, routinely against mock-up targets. This includes tanks, armoured vehicle mounted weapons, general artillery, anti-tank artillery, mortar artillery and the full spectrum of infantry carried small arms. The exercise implements the organisation and tactics of combined-arms warfare, and also invites participation from the Hellenic Air Force and Navy, as well as the Greek ELDYK contingent in Cyprus.  Turkish reactions  The Turkish Government routinely reacts to the Nikiforos-Toxotis exercise by organising its own military exercises in northern Cyprus, and occasionally by conducting penetrative violations of the Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR) with its Air Force jet aircraft. The Turkish Government routinely denounces the use of the Nikiforos-Toxotis exercise.

They did not open their association football section until 1903 however with a slight name change.La squadra del mio cuore \\"La Roma\\", allegato a Corriere dello Sport - Stadio - Modena, Franco Cosimo Panini Editore 1995 p.19 During the earliest days of the Italian Football Championship, only Northern Italian football clubs gained entry into the league so Roman had to wait until 1912‚Äì13 to make their championship debut and finished mid-table in the Lazio group. The following season the club played well, but did not progress past the Lazio group stage as SS Lazio themselves were more dominant. Their third season in the championship was more successful, they finished top of the Lazio group earning progression to the Central and Southern finals; even beating rivals SS Lazio 5‚Äì2. However, before the competition could progress any further, it was called off because of World War I. Post-war After World War I, Roman were weaker, they finished bottom of their group in the 1919‚Äì20 return season as they had to forfeit several games. Similar results were returned in the following season. During the Italian Football Federation splinter of 1921, Roman participated in the CCI variation rather than the FIGC one. When the leagues merged back together, Roman performed poorly and were relegated down to \\"I Divisione\\" (now known as Serie B). Roman could not gain promotion after several seasons of trying, and in 1927 they merged with Alba- Audace and Fortitudo to form AS Roma. References Category:A.S.

The Kaunas City Theatre, where the first session of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania took place (pictured before the First World War) The Kaunas State Musical Theatre is a musical theatre in Kaunas, Lithuania. It was established on November 27, 1940, in the former State Theatre hall adjoining the Laisvƒós Alƒója. For some time, it mostly presented operettas. The building The decision to build a Kaunas City Theatre was made in 1891, and the first play was staged there on January 9, 1892. Renaissance Revival architecture was chosen as a style for the building, and it was built in the City Garden square. The two-storey building incorporated a hall of 500 square meters in size. Spectators also could watch plays from the two-storey balcony rows. In the balconies, special loges were established for the Governor of Kaunas and the commandant of Kaunas Fortress. After Lithuania established independence in 1918 and Kaunas became the temporary capital, the theatre became a cradle for modern Lithuanian drama, opera and ballet theatres. The theatre was reconstructed in 1922‚Äì1925, 1930-1933 and 1980. The exterior of the building took on characteristics of Baroque Revival architecture, and the audience hall was enlarged to 763 seats, with a third row of balconies and a central loge added. Romas Kalanta set himself on fire in 1972 as a protest against the Soviet regime in the nearby square. Musical theater In 1948, the company of the Lithuanian Opera and Ballet Theatre, which resided in the State Musical Theatre, was moved to Vilnius, and musical theatre became the only dramatic genre cultivated in the building. It built its reputation on staging musical comedies. After Lithuania regained independence, the theatre added opera to its repertoire. Notable performances *Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto, 1951.

The two most common areas with cartilage piercings are the ear and the nose. Many people outside of the body modification community often informally use the term \\"cartilage piercing\\" to refer a helix piercing. The cartilage ear piercing is known to be more sore than the lobe as in the cartilage there is less blood so it takes longer to heal.  Types of Ear Cartilage Piercings  * Helix: The outer rim of cartilage on the ear, extending from just above the lobe to its apex and then curving down slightly to meet the head. ** Forward Helix: The area of the helix closest to the head; generally any piercing between the apex of the helix and where the helix joins the head. ** Industrial: Two piercings joined by a single piece of jewelry, usually a barbell, commonly with one piercing in the helix and the other in the forward helix, though other multiple-piercing placements may still be termed industrials. *Antihelix: The raised ridge of cartilage between the helix and ear canal. **Rook: The upper ridge of cartilage of the antihelix; between the tragus and apex of the helix. For most people, a rook piercing through a prominent ridge of cartilage will give the jewelry a vertical appearance as the piercing goes from top to bottom of the surface. **Snug: The lower ridge of cartilage of the antihelix. A snug piercing also has a unique appearance as the cartilage is pierced from one side to the other, rather than from front to back. *Conch: Can refer to a piercing of either the inner or outer conch. **Inner Conch: The cup-shaped portion of the ear directly in front of the ear canal, used for capturing sound. **Outer Conch: The relatively flat area between the rim that forms the helix and the ridge that defines the antihelix. *Daith: The small flap of cartilage just above the ear canal. With a correctly placed daith, the entrance and exit holes will be unseen and the jewelry will appear to be coming out of the ear canal itself. It will rest in the inner conch. *Tragus: The small, thick flap of cartilage directly over the ear canal, connected to the head. *Antitragus: A small knub of cartilage just above the earlobe and across from the tragus.  Types of Nose Cartilage Piercings  *Nostril: A piercing passing through the nostril on either side and ending in the inside of the nose. **High Nostril: A piercing placed further towards the top of the nose, much closer to the bone than a standard nostril piercing. *Nose Tip: A piercing that begins within either nostril and exits at the tip of the nose. *Nasallang: A set of three piercings connected by one piece of jewelry, usually a barbell. Both nostrils are pierced, as well as the septum. Depending on anatomy, the piercer, and the preference of the client, the septum piercing may or may not go through cartilage. *Septum: The piece of tissue in the middle of the nose separating the two nostrils. A septum piercing is often incorrectly regarded as a cartilage piercing. While some people do have septum piercings which pass through cartilage, most septum piercings pass through the small bit of tissue directly beneath the cartilage and above the skin.

According to the ISI Web Of Science, he was the most highly cited computer scientist in Brazil. Jorge Stolfi was born in Vila Carr√£o, a suburb of S√£o Paulo. His parents had immigrated to Brazil from the Veneto region of Italy only two years earlier, and so he spoke Venetian as his first language. He obtained an engineering degree in electronics (1973) and M.Sc. in applied mathematics (1979) from the University of S√£o Paulo. From 1979 to 1988 he was a student of Leo Guibas at Stanford University, where he got a Ph.D in computer science. He had a CNPq grant from 1979 to 1983, then a research internship at Xerox PARC until 1985, and also at the DEC Systems Research Center (SRC) until 1988. After obtaining his Ph.D. he became a research engineer at SRC. In 1992 he returned to Brazil to take a position at the Computer Science Department of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), which later became the university's Institute of Computing. He was the institute's chairman from 2004 to 2008. Despite that, Stolfi has been criticised by students for not correcting undergraduate tests in 2016 and awarding random grades. Research While at Stanford, Leo Guibas and Jorge worked on the then-new field of computational geometry. Among other results they developed the quad-edge data structure for two-dimensional maps, the kinetic framework for computational geometry. Jorge's Ph.D. dissertation on oriented projective geometry was later published as a book. From original Stanford Ph.D. dissertation, Primitives for Computational Geometry, available as DEC SRC Research Report 36, published by HP Labs. Accessed 2010-12-28. He also drew dozens of cartoons for the DEC SRC technical reports. In 1992 Jorge collected and widely disseminated (through the historic DEC gatekeeper ftp archives and Prime Time Freeware) a set of wordlists that later formed the basis of the ispell resources (later myspell, currently part of OpenOffice.org and Mozilla as hunspell). After moving to UNICAMP, Jorge developed affine arithmetic, a model for self-validated computation (which he had conceived in 1991), in collaboration with Marcus Andrade, Jo√£o Comba, and Luiz Figueiredo. At UNICAMP Jorge also worked with C. Lucchesi and T.Kowaltowski on finite state transducer technology for spell checking and other natural language processing tasks. With his student H. Leit√£o he developed an efficient algorithm for pottery fragment reassembly by multiscale outline matching, and analyzed the density of useful information contained in those outlines. He has also contributed to the study of the Voynich manuscript. Since 2001 Jorge has been involved in efforts to raise public and government awareness about the insecurity of Brazilian electronic voting machines, which are of the direct recording electronic (DRE) type and therefore vulnerable to massive and undetectable software-based vote-stealing. Bitcoin activities In late 2013, Jorge took an active interest in the economics of cryptocurrencies. He became skeptical about its underlying soundness and chances of success and has been advising the Brazilian public against investment in bitcoin.(2013) Cuidado com Bitcoin!.

It enables states to share resources during natural and man-made disasters, including terrorism. EMAC complements the national disaster response system. EMAC is used alongside federal assistance or when federal assistance is not warranted. EMAC facilitates the maximum use of all available resources within member states' inventories.GAO Report to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate: Emergency Management Assistance Compact: Enhancing EMAC's Collaborative and Administrative Capacity Should Improve National Disaster Response. June 2007. How it works Under EMAC, requests and deployment of resources are made at the discretion of the affected state. At all times, affected states retain the choice of seeking resource support from states, the federal government, or both as may be determined by the size of the disaster event. The main contact for agencies, organizations, and the private sector to learn more about EMAC is the state emergency management agencies. EMAC works as follows: When a disaster occurs, the governor of the affected state or territory declares a state of emergency. The impacted state assesses its resource needs and identifies shortfalls for which assistance will be requested, and authorized representatives from the affected state then activate EMAC. These authorized representatives as well as EMAC Advance Team (A-Team) members then determine the state's needs for personnel and equipment and broadcasts an EMAC requisition to other states. States with available resources negotiate costs with the affected state through the EMAC network, executing EMAC Form Req-A. Assisting states that commit to an agreement then mobilize and deploy the agreed-upon resources (personnel or equipment) to the affected state. Once the mission is completed, the resources are demobilized and redeployed to their home states. Deployed personnel provide receipts and records to their home state to develop a reimbursement package, which is then sent to the affected state, which then reimburses the assisting state. EMAC is administered by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), which provides the day-to-day support and technical backbone for EMAC education and operations at its headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky. History EMAC was proposed by former Florida Governor Lawton Chiles after 1992's Hurricane Andrew. It was formed in 1993, and in 1995 any state was allowed to join and the National Emergency Management Association was made the administrator. Following the 1996 consent of the 104th U.S. Congress to EMAC (PL-104-321), which is required by the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution for any compact between states, EMAC has grown to become a nationwide system for providing mutual aid. To be a member of EMAC, each state or territory legislature must have passed legislation which was signed into law, adopting the standard language of the Compact. Since at least 2003, all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam are members of EMAC. In 2004, EMAC was utilized during the response to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. Through EMAC, more than 800 state and local personnel from 38 states (including California, which was not an EMAC member at that time) were deployed to Florida, Alabama, and West Virginia. The cost was approximately $15 million in personnel, equipment, and National Guard expenditures. In 2005, EMAC was activated ten times in response to one wildfire, one flood, one tropical storm, two winter storms, and five hurricanes. Most striking, more than 65,000 personnel from 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were deployed under EMAC through the state emergency management agencies in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Total costs for the 2005 EMAC events are expected to exceed $840 million.Emergency Management Assistance Compact: 2005 Hurricane Season Response After Action Report. Titan-L3. September 2006. Benefits In addition to providing another avenue for states to receive assistance in times of disaster, EMAC offers the following benefits: * Assistance may be more readily available. EMAC allows states to ask for whatever assistance they need for any type of emergency‚Äîfrom earthquakes to acts of terrorism. EMAC's simple procedures help states dispense with bureaucratic wrangling. * Legislation solves the problems of liability and responsibilities of cost. Once the conditions for providing assistance to a requesting state have been set, the terms constitute a legally binding contractual agreement that makes affected states responsible for reimbursement. Responding states can rest assured that sending aid will not be a financial or legal burden, and personnel who are deployed are protected under workers compensation and liability provisions. * Legislation allows for credentials to be honored across state lines.

There was one single released from Creedence Country, \\"Cotton Fields\\" b/w \\"Lodi\\", in November. The single charted in Billboard magazine's Hot Country Singles chart, while the album did not chart. The album has been re-released in multiple formats, including a 2004 remastered CD with three bonus tracks.  Compilation and songs  According to an article in Billboard magazine, the idea for Creedence Country came from Bob Saporiti after listening to CCR's albums and hearing a prominent country influence in the group's songs. In the article, Saporiti said that the (former) members of the band compiled the songs for the album; although, he did not specify which members were involved. Of the 12 songs on the original album, none were from the group's self-titled debut album or Bayou Country, three were from Green River, two were from Willy and the Poor Boys, five were from Cosmo's Factory, and two were from Mardi Gras. Of the three reissue bonus tracks two were from Mardi Gras and one was from Pendulum.

Reid as a one-design racer and first built in 1969.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 22-23. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was initially built by the designer himself through his company Marine Plastics in Foster City, California, United States starting in 1969. As demand increased he subcontracted construction to other companies. Barrett Bruch formed Banshee International, Inc. in Santa Cruz, California in August 1974, with Reid as vice-president, to take over construction. Additional company production capacity was added in Scotts Valley, California in 1982. A total of 9,000 boats were built, but Banshee International is no longer in business and the boat is now out of production. Abbott Boats in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada was licensed to construct 500 Banshees, but it is unknown if that number were actually completed. Design Banshee The boat was derived from the Flying Junior hull design and envisioned by Reid as a mass-market boat, with more appeal for racing than the contemporary Sunfish. The Banshee is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with foam flotation, making the boat unsinkable. It has an unstayed catboat rig, with aluminum spars, including a non-rotating mast, a loose-footed, four-batten mainsail, a spooned raked stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung, kick-up rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable daggerboard. The hull alone displaces . The boat has a draft of with the daggerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer or car roof rack. For sailing the boat has a boom vang, a Cunningham and an adjustable outhaul. The mast can be pivoted fore and aft, normally raked aft when sailing to windward and adjusted forward when on a run downwind. The mainsail is mounted via a sleeve over the mast and so is not hoisted by a halyard. The daggerboard may be adjusted fore-and-aft to balance the mainsail, when the sail is reefed by rolling it around the mast. Variants ;Banshee :The base model has a sail of and a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 94.3. ;Banshee T :This model has a reduced sail area of to improve stability and has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 99.9. ;Griffon (or Gryphon) :An experimental model built by Banshee International, with a slightly modified hull shape. It was made from carbon fiber with a hull weight of . A total of 15 were constructed. Operational history The class rules allow modifications to the running rigging, including the sail shape, but no changes to the hull, spars or the sail. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote that the Banshee is \\"a high-performance boat designed for cartopping. Maximum capacity is two, or in a pinch, three.\\" In 1994 it was reported that 50 fleets in five countries were racing the design.

Both ships were designed by French foreign advisors to the early Meiji government in the employ of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. As with Kaimon, construction took much longer than initially anticipated, and she required over seven years to complete. However, even after launching, numerous issues needed to be addressed, including a problem with stability that required the addition of bulges to the hull. Operational history Tenry≈´ saw combat service in the First Sino-Japanese War, at the Battle of Lushunkou and subsequently at the Battle of Yalu River. On 21 March 1898, Tenry≈´ was designated a third-class coastal defense ship, and was used for coastal patrol duties. She caught fire on November 1897, and required extensive repairs.

It is also known as the plasmoid ring, vortex ring, or helicon ring. This physical model treated electrons and protons as elementary particles, and was first proposed by Alfred Lauck Parson in 1915. Theory Instead of a single orbiting charge, the toroidal ring was conceived as a collection of infinitesimal charge elements, which orbited or circulated along a common continuous path or \\"loop\\". In general, this path of charge could assume any shape, but tended toward a circular form due to internal repulsive electromagnetic forces. In this configuration the charge elements circulated, but the ring as a whole did not radiate due to changes in electric or magnetic fields since it remained stationary. The ring produced an overall magnetic field (\\"spin\\") due to the current of the moving charge elements. These elements circulated around the ring at the speed of light c, but at frequency ŒΩ = c/2œÄR, which depended inversely on the radius R. The ring's inertial energy increased when compressed, like a spring, and was also inversely proportional to its radius, and therefore proportional to its frequency ŒΩ. The theory claimed that the proportionality constant was Planck's constant h, the conserved angular momentum of the ring. According to the model, electrons or protons could be viewed as bundles of \\"fibers\\" or \\"plasmoids\\" with total charge ¬±e. The electrostatic repulsion force between charge elements of the same sign was balanced by the magnetic attraction force between the parallel currents in the fibers of a bundle, per Amp√®re's law. These fibers twisted around the torus of the ring as they progressed around its radius, forming a Slinky-like helix. Circuit completion demanded that each helical plasmoid fiber twisted around the ring an integer number of times as it proceeded around the ring. This requirement was thought to account for \\"quantum\\" values of angular momentum and radiation. Chirality demanded the number of fibers to be odd, probably three, like a rope. The helicity of the twist, was thought to distinguish the electron from the proton . The toroidal or \\"helicon\\" model did not demand a constant radius or inertial energy for a particle. In general its shape, size, and motion adjusted according to the external electromagnetic fields from its environment. These adjustments or reactions to external field changes constituted the emission or absorption of radiation for the particle. The model, then, claimed to explain how particles linked together to form atoms. History=Beginnings The development of the helicon or toroidal ring began with Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, who in 1823 proposed tiny magnetic \\"loops of charge\\" to explain the attractive force between current elements. In that same era Carl Friedrich Gauss and Michael Faraday also uncovered foundational laws of classical electrodynamics, later collected by James Maxwell as Maxwell's equations. When Maxwell expressed the laws of Gauss, Faraday, and Amp√®re in differential form, he assumed point particles, an assumption that remains foundational to relativity theory and quantum mechanics today. In 1867 Lord Kelvin suggested that the vortex rings of a perfect fluid discovered by Hermann von Helmholtz represented \\"the only true atoms\\".William Thomson, \\"On Vortex Atoms\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, V6, pp. 94‚Äì105 (1867) {reprinted in Philosophical Magazine, V34, pp. 15‚Äì24 (1867)}. Then shortly before 1900, as scientists still debated over the very existence of atoms, J. J. ThomsonJ. J. Thomson, \\"Cathode Rays\\", Philosophical Magazine, S5, V44, p. 293 (1897). and Ernest RutherfordErnest Rutherford, \\"Uranium Radiation and the Electrical Conduction \\", Philosophical Magazine, S5, V47, pp. 109‚Äì163 (Jan 1899). sparked a revolution with experimentsSee Thomson experiment and Rutherford experiment for details. confirming the existence and properties of electrons, protons, and nuclei. Max Planck added to the fire when he solved the blackbody radiation problem by assuming not only discrete particles, but discrete frequencies of radiation emanating from these \\"particles\\" or \\"resonators\\". Planck's famous paper,Max Planck, \\"On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum‚Äù, Annalen der Physik, V4, p. 553 ff (1901). which incidentally calculated both Planck's constant h and Boltzmann's constant kB, suggested that something in the \\"resonators\\" themselves provided these discrete frequencies. Numerous theories about the structure of the atom developed in the wake of all the new information,J. J. Thomson, \\"On the Structure of the Atom... \\", Philosophical Magazine, S6, V7, N39, pp. 237‚Äì265 (Mar 1904).Ernest Rutherford, \\"The Scattering of Œ± and Œ≤ Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom \\", Philosophical Magazine, S6, V21, pp. 669‚Äì688 (May 1911). of which the 1913 model of Niels Bohr came to predominate. The Bohr modelNiels Bohr, \\"On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules \\", Philosophical Magazine, S6, V26, p. 1‚Äì25 (July 1913). proposed electrons in circular orbit around the nucleus with quantized values of angular momentum. Instead of radiating energy continuously, as classical electrodynamics demanded from an accelerating charge, Bohr's electron radiated discretely when it \\"leaped\\" from one state of angular momentum to another. Parson magneton In 1915, Alfred Lauck Parson proposed his \\"magneton\\"Alfred L. Parson, \\"A Magneton Theory of the Structure of the Atom\\", Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection, Pub 2371, 80pp (Nov 1915) {Reprinted Pub 2419, V65, N11 (1916)}. as an improvement over the Bohr model, depicting finite-sized particles with the ability to maintain stability and emit and absorb radiation from electromagnetic waves. At about the same time Leigh Page developed a classical theory of blackbody radiation assuming rotating \\"oscillators\\", able to store energy without radiating.Leigh Page, \\"The Distribution of Energy in the Normal Radiation Spectrum\\", Physical Review, S2, V7, N2, pp. 229‚Äì240 (Feb 1916). Gilbert N. Lewis was inspired in part by Parson's model in developing his theory of chemical bonding.Gilbert N. Lewis, \\"The Atom and the Molecule \\", Journal of the American Chemical Society, V38, pp. 762‚Äì786 (1916). Then David L. Webster wrote three papers connecting Parson's magneton with Page's oscillatorDavid L. Webster, \\"Notes on Page's Theory of Heat Radiation\\", Physical Review, S2, V8, N1, pp. 66‚Äì69 (Jul 1916). and explaining massDavid L. Webster, \\"The Theory of Electromagnetic Mass of the Parson Magneton and other Non-Spherical Systems\\", Physical Review, S2, V9, N6, pp. 484‚Äì499 (Jun 1917). and alpha scatteringDavid L. Webster, \\"The Scattering of Alpha Rays as Evidence on the Parson Magnetron Hypothesis\\", Physical Review, S2 (Feb 1918). in terms of the magneton. In 1917 Lars O. Grondahl confirmed the model with his experiments on free electrons in iron wires.Lars O. Grondahl, \\"Proceedings of the American Physical Society: Experimental Evidence for the Parson Magneton\\", Physical Review, S2, V10, N5, pp. 586‚Äì588 (Nov 1917). Parson's theory next attracted the attention of Arthur Compton, who wrote a series of papers on the properties of the electron,Arthur H. Compton, \\"The Size and Shape of the Electron ‚Äì American Physical Society address (Dec 1917)\\", Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, pp. 330 (Jan 1918).Arthur H.

Compton, \\"The Magnetic Electron\\", Journal of the Franklin Institute, V192, N2, pp. 145‚Äì155 (Aug 1921) and H. Stanley Allen, whose papers also argued for a \\"ring electron\\".H. Stanley Allen, \\"The Case for a Ring Electron\\", Proceedings of the Physical Society of London, V31, N1, pp. 49‚Äì68 (Dec 1918).H. Stanley Allen, \\"Optical Rotation, Optical Isomerism, and the Ring Electron\\", Philosophical Magazine, S6, V40, N6, p. 426 (1920).H. Stanley Allen, \\"The Angular Momentum and Some Related Properties of the Ring Electron\\", Philosophical Magazine, S6, V41, N6, p. 113 (1921). Current status The aspect of the Parson magneton with the most experimental relevance (and the aspect investigated by Grondahl and Webster) was the existence of an electron magnetic dipole moment; this dipole moment is indeed present. However, later work by Paul Dirac and Alfred Land√© showed that a pointlike particle could have an intrinsic quantum spin, and also a magnetic moment. The highly successful modern theory, Standard Model of particle physics describes a pointlike electron with an intrinsic spin and magnetic moment. On the other hand, the usual assertion that an electron is pointlike may be conventionally associated only with a \\"bare\\" electron. The pointlike electron would have a diverging electromagnetic field, which should create a strong vacuum polarization. In accordance with QED, deviations from the Coulomb law are predicted at Compton scale distances from the centre of electron, 10‚àí11 cm. Virtual processes in the Compton region determine the spin of electron and renormalization of its charge and mass. It shows that the Compton region of the electron should be considered as a coherent whole with its pointlike core, forming a physical (\\"dressed\\") electron. Notice that the Dirac theory of electron also exhibits the peculiar behaviour of the Compton region. In particular, electrons display zitterbewegung at the Compton scale. From this point of view, the ring model does not contradict QED or the Dirac theory and some versions could possibly be used to incorporate gravity in quantum theory. The question of whether the electron has a substructure of any sort must be decided by experiment. All experiments to date agree with the Standard Model of the electron, with no substructure, ring-like or otherwise. The two major approaches are high-energy electron‚Äìpositron scatteringD.

At present, the Compton region of virtual processes, 10‚àí11 cm across, is not exhibited in the high-energy experiments on electron‚Äìpositron scattering.

Many of the historic items related to Coptic Christianity are on display in many museums around the world and a large number is in the Coptic Museum in Coptic Cairo. Apostolic foundation Egypt is identified in the Bible as the place of refuge that the Holy Family sought in its flightHoly Family in Egypt from Judea: \\"When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod the Great, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I called My Son\\" (Matthew 2:12-23). The Egyptian Church, which is now more than nineteen centuries old, regards itself as the subject of many prophecies in the Old Testament. Isaiah the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says \\"In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.\\" The first Christians in Egypt were mainly Alexandrian Jews such as Theophilus, whom Saint Luke the Evangelist addresses in the introductory chapter of his gospel. When the Church of Alexandria was founded by Saint Mark Coptic history on Egypt state information during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero, a great multitude of native Egyptians (as opposed to Greeks or Jews) embraced the Christian faith. Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Saint Mark's arrival in Alexandria as is clear from the New Testament writings found in Bahnasa, in Middle Egypt, which date around the year 200 AD, and a fragment of the Gospel of John, written in Coptic, which was found in Upper Egypt and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local language, namely Coptic. Catechetical School The Catechetical School of Alexandria is the oldest catechetical school in the world. St. Jerome records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by St. Mark himself.Coptic Church.net Around 190 AD under the leadership of the scholar Pantanaeus, the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as Athenagoras, Clement, Didymus, and the native Egyptian Origen, who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. Origen wrote over 6,000 commentaries of the Bible in addition to his famous Hexapla. Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before Braille, wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write. Cradle of Monasticism and its missionary work Many Egyptian Christians went to the desert during the 3rd century, and remained there to pray and work and dedicate their lives to seclusion and worship of God. This was the beginning of the monastic movement, which was organized by Anthony the Great, Saint Paul, the world's first anchorite, Saint Macarius the Great and Saint Pachomius the Cenobite in the 4th century. Christian Monasticism was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the Coptic Orthodox Church character of submission, simplicity and humility, thanks to the teachings and writings of the Great Fathers of Egypt's Deserts. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. A great number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations to this day. All Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example: Saint Basil the Great Archbishop of Caesaria of Cappadocia, founder and organiser of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around 357 AD and his rule is followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches; Saint Jerome who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt, while en route to Jerusalem, around 400 AD and left details of his experiences in his letters; Benedict founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, but in a stricter form. Countless pilgrims have visited the \\"Desert Fathers\\" to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives.

Two types of thread were used, but only the white linen threads have survived, and the red woolen threads have mostly deteriorated.Art in Needlework: A Book About Embroidery (1901) Edict of Milan The Edict of Milan issued by the Roman Emperor Constantine I 313 A. D. marked an end of anti Christianity ; afterwards Constantine made Christianity legal, which may have led to the decline of many Pagan practices including mummification in Egypt.calcademy Council of Nicea In the 4th century, an Alexandrian presbyter named Arius began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as Arianism (not to be confused with the Nazi ideology Aryanism). The Ecumenical Council of Nicea 325 AD was convened by Constantine under the presidency of Saint Hosius of Cordova and Saint Alexander of Alexandria to resolve the dispute and eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the Nicene Creed. The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was based largely on the teaching put forth by a man who eventually would become Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, the chief opponent of Arius. Council of Constantinople In the year 381 AD, Saint Timothy I of Alexandria presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, which completed the Nicene Creed with this confirmation of the divinity of the Holy Spirit: :\\"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Universal, and Apostolic Church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen.\\" Council of Ephesus Coptic Icon in the Coptic Altar of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Logos was not hypostatically joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title \\"Mother of God\\" (Theotokos) to the Virgin Mary, declaring her instead to be \\"Mother of Christ\\" Christotokos. When reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark, Pope Saint Cyril I of Alexandria acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent. When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope Cyril I of Alexandria, supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as \\"The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.\\" This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: \\"The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.\\" In these anathemas, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, \\"Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title Theotokos is Anathema!\\" Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431), over which Cyril I of Alexandria presided.David W. Johnson, \\"Nestorius,\\" Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia The First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus confirmed the teachings of Saint Athanasius and confirmed the title of Mary as \\"Mother of God\\". It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Cyril had said that there is \\"One Nature [and One Hypostasis] for God the Word Incarnate\\" (Mia Physis tou Theou Logou Sesark≈çmenƒì). Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows: :\\"We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God (Theotokos) for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen.\\" Council of Chalcedon St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria When in 451, Emperor Marcianus attempted to heal divisions in the Church, the response of Pope Dioscorus ‚Äì the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled ‚Äì was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the Church. It was at Chalcedon that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response of his boldness. The Council of Chalcedon, from the perspective of the Alexandrine Christology, has deviated from the approved Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed, \\"Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary,\\" thus the foundation of the definition according to the Non- Chalcedonian adherents, according to the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria is valid. In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is \\"One Nature‚Äîthe Logos Incarnate,\\" of the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians understanding is that Christ is recognized in two natures, full humanity and full divinity. Oriental Orthodoxy contends that such a formulation is no different from what the Nestorians teach. This is the doctrinal perception that makes the apparent difference which separated the Oriental Orthodox from the Eastern Orthodox. The council's findings were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the Byzantine Empire, including Egyptians, Syrians, Armenians, and others. From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark and the \\"Melkite\\" or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the Greek Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa.Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria. Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria). Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in communion with the other leading churches of Rome and Constantinople. The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the Oriental Orthodox Church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria regards itself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. There was an opinion in the Church that viewed that perhaps the Council understood the Church of Alexandria correctly, but wanted to curtail the existing power of the Alexandrine Hierarch, especially after the events that happened several years before at Constantinople from Pope Theophilus of Alexandria towards Patriarch John Chrysostom and the unfortunate turnouts of the Second Council of Ephesus in 449 AD, where Eutichus misled Pope Dioscoros and the council in confessing the Orthodox Faith in writing and then renouncing it after the council, which in turn, had upset Rome, especially that the Tome which was sent was not read during the Council sessions. To make thing even worse, the Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was, according to the Alexandria School of Theology, particularly in regards to the definition of Christology, considered influenced by Nestorian heretical teachings. So, due to the above-mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, an impasse was to be and there was a scape goat, i.e. Pope Disocoros. By anathemizing Pope Leo, because of the tone and content of his Tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Discoros was found guilty of doing so, without due process, in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449 AD. It is important to note that Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons. Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.Romanides, John S. Leo of Rome's Support of Theodoret. Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians \\"monophysites\\", though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as \\"dyophysite\\". A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is miaphysite, which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called \\"the nature of the incarnate word\\", which was reiterated by Saint Cyril of Alexandria. Copts, thus, believe in two natures \\"human\\" and \\"divine\\" that are united in one hypostasis \\"without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration\\". These two natures \\"did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye\\" (Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea). From Chalcedon to the Arab invasion of Egypt Copts suffered under the rule of the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire. The Melkite Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred the Egyptian population whom they considered heretics. Many Egyptians were tortured and martyred to accept the terms of Chalcedon, but Egyptians remained loyal to the faith of their fathers and to the Cyrillian view of Christology. One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of that period is Saint Samuel the Confessor. Arab- Muslim conquest of Egypt The Arab Muslim conquest of Egypt took place in 639. Despite the political upheaval, historians estimate that the majority of the Egyptian population remained Christian until somewhere between the 9th century and the middle of the 14th century.. O'Sullivan concludes in favor of an early date for Islamization during the 9th century, but cites Tamer el- Leithy as a recent defense of a later date during the 14th. There were major persecutions during and following the reign of the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi- Amr Allah (reigned 996‚Äì1021) and Copts were massacred during the reign of the Mamluks. Acceptance of Arabic as a liturgical language took place under the papacy of Pope of Alexandria Gabriel ibn-Turaik.Kamil, op cit. During Islamic rule, the Copts were required to pay a special tax, comparable to Byzantine taxes, called the jizya in return for defense from the Caliphate and exemption from military service.The payment of the jizya tax also meant that Copts were required to wear special clothing to distinguish them from Muslims and that they could practice their own Coptic Law exempt from Shari'a law courts. This tax was abolished in 1855 under Sa'id Pasha. From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution The position of the Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of Muhammad Ali's dynasty. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit and, by 1855 the Jizya tax was lifted. Shortly thereafter, Christians started to serve in the Egyptian army. The 1919 revolution in Egypt, the first display of Egyptian identity with respect to its homogeneity of Egypt's modern society with both its Muslim and Christian components occurred.

The History of Cornwall The shaft at Creddis was no deeper than thirty fathoms (55 m) and employed about forty men. Adjoining Creddis, but in the parish of St Issey, was the copper mine of Legossick. This had a steam engine on it, being a large adventure, it employed many men. There were a few mines of this sort in the area; and one, Wheal Paynter showed a course of lead at twelve fathoms (22 m).Berry, Claude Cornwall; p. 136 Little Petherick Creek The village gives its name to the tidal creek of the River Camel, the location most likely being chosen as the highest navigable point with evidence of quays here still being visible. Between Little Petherick and the River Camel is Sea Mills. Here a tidal lagoon was created to capture the rising tide, the outflow being diverted via a tide mill used to grind flour.

He played a major role in the transition from Mannerist to Baroque painting in Spain. Life Details about the life of the artist are scarce and largely uncertain. Accepted opinion about his life, including his birth in Seville, was overturned in the year 2000 when a Spanish scholar demonstrated that early biographers had mixed up the painter with a contemporary Carmelite canon with the same name who was a native of Seville. The revised view is that the painter Juan de Roelas was not a native of Seville, but was a native of Flanders. The documentary evidence for this was found in two notarial documents which show the presence of a Flemish painter named Juan de Flandes, along with his father, in Valladolid in 1594 (the accepted opinion placed the painter's presence in this city at a later date, somewhere from 1598 to 1602). In the first document (relating to a loan repayment) Juan and his father declare themselves to be painters from Flanders. This has led to the conclusion that Juan de Roelas was Flemish by birth and not a native of Seville. This view is further supported by the fact that Juan de Roelas was later given the commission to paint the Martyrdom of Saint Andrew for the Chapel of the Flemish in the Saint Thomas Church in Seville (now at the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville). Saint Andrew was at the time the patron saint of Flanders. A Flemish background also offers an explanation for the stylistic characteristics of de Roelas' work which had been explained traditionally by a presumed trip to Venice and an apprenticeship with a follower of Titian.Antonia Fern√°ndez del Hoyo, 'Juan de Roelas pintor flamenco', in: Boletin del Museo Nacional de Escultura National Sculpture Museum in Valladolid The new findings about the prior mix-up of the biographical details of the painter with those of a Spanish monk and the lack of other documentation have made it difficult to separate and confirm the details of his life. It is known that in 1598 he worked in Valladolid in the commemorative ceremonies for the death of king Philip II of Spain, contributing to the design of his funerary monument. He remained there until 1604, when he obtained a benefice or favour from the Count-Duke of Olivares. In the village of, Olivares, near Seville, de Roelas made several large paintings to decorate altars in and around Seville. It is reported that he moved to Madrid where he tried to obtain an appointment as painter to the royal court, but that when he failed he returned to Olivares where he died in 1625. He had many disciples, among whom Francisco Varela from Seville and Pablo Legote from Luxembourg. Work Juan de Roelas is now regarded as a pivotal artist in the evolution of the history of painting in Seville, especially in the years prior to the appearance of Zurbar√°n, Cano, Herrera, de Castillo, Murillo and Leal. The latter two artists in particular were influenced by de Roelas, both in terms of iconography and composition as well as technique. Above all, his fundamental influence lies in the assimilation of Baroque naturalism which would emerge fully with Murillo and would be one of the constants of Seville Baroque painting. De Roelas contributed to Sevilian painting of the early 17th century what was formerly interpreted as the expressive and technical aspects of the Venetian art of Titian and Veronese, causing his paintings to be considered Italianate in their variegated and theatrical compositions, their richness and warmth of colour ranges, the use of broad and bold brushstrokes and their unusual size.'Juan de Roelas' In light of recent scholarship, however, scholarly consensus is that Roelas' oeuvre is better understood in the context of Flemish painting than in the supposed influence of the Venetian school. The calling of St Peter and St Andrew, Bilbao Fine Arts Museum Trained in the style of late Mannerism, de Roelas introduced light effects that are similar to those of Jacopo Bassano. He was particularly adept at depicting everyday life, completing his compositions on sacred themes with vulgar elements of daily life. This aspect of his art was criticised by some contemporary painters such as Francisco Pacheco. Through its interest in the study of nature, de Roelas's work forms a transition from the artificiality of Mannerism to the naturalistic realism of Spanish Baroque. He popularized the use of a particular format of altarpiece which was divided into two juxtaposed halves, the upper half depicting the divine world, and the bottom half representing the underworld. This division is typically Mannerist, and had already been used successfully by El Greco. This division of the canvas was very successful in Andalusia.Enrique Valdivieso Gonz√°lez et al., 'Juan de Roelas, h. 1570-1625', Junta de Andaluc√≠a, Consejer√≠a de Cultura, 2008 Roelas' paintings are very numerous in Seville. His masterpieces include Martyrdom of St. Andrew and El Transito de San Isidoro (Death of St. Isidore), an altarpiece residing in the Church of San Isidore; another of his finest works is the painting Santiago at the Battle of Clavijo, hung in the Chapel of Santiago in Seville Cathedral, which represents the saint riding victoriously over the Moors. Cean Bermudez praised it for its force and grandeur. The writer Richard Ford, well-versed in Spanish art, was especially impressed by the picture of the Conception (Concepci√≥n), in the Academy, and by three in the chapel of the University at Seville. Roelas has been compared to TintorettoBaticle 1987, p. 47 and Carracci, and is ranked among the best of the Andalusian painters. He excelled in design and composition, and his work displayed a grandeur of form and character common to the great masters of painting.

History As a vision of Henry W. Grady, (the editor of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper in the 1880s), Grady Memorial Hospital opened in May 1892 with 100 beds and established the first citywide ambulance service in 1896 with several horse-drawn modified enclosed wagons. Prior to 1892, the city did not have any formal ambulance service and regular horse-drawn wagons at best served to transport the sick and injured. Grady, along with Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Bellevue Hospital in New York City and Cincinnati General was among the first hospitals to operate ambulances in America. In 1890, the population of Atlanta was recorded as 65,533 and included both the downtown area and Inman Park. Its Northern limits did not extend much past 14th street and travelling further north quickly transitioned into rural countryside. By 1895 the city limits was expanded and saw the annexation of West End in 1896. Like other hospital based ambulance service, interns or even surgeons would often ride the ambulance to the most severe ambulance calls and had a medical bag complete with instruments that had proven effective in treating civil war battlefield injuries several decades prior. According to old records, as Grady Hospital entered the twentieth century in 1900, the ambulance service responded to 2140 ambulance calls. As motorized \\"horseless carriages\\" began to appear on Atlanta streets, so did the adoption by Grady to this \\"new fangled\\" technology. And ambulance design also began to improve in the vehicles suspension and overall design of the Ford Model T. Atlanta area funeral homes had also entered the arena of providing ambulance service as a community service using hearses that could be quickly changed to accommodate a Bumgartner or Washington Mortuary Company single level stretcher. In the 1930s and during World War II, Grady Hospital Ambulance Service used Packards as ambulances. In 1946, many Grady ambulances responded to the tragic Winecoff Hotel fire in Downtown Atlanta which injured hundreds and killed 146 and is still regarded as the Nation's worst hotel fire disaster. That same year, a Grady Ambulance responded to \\"Five Points\\" in downtown Atlanta to transport \\"Gone With The Wind\\" author Margaret Mitchell to Grady where she later died from her injuries after being hit by a taxi. In the 1950s the service gradually changed over to GMC truck chassis when the hospital's operation was taken over by the City of Atlanta. With the municipal takeover, the ambulance service became a part of the hospitals security department and Tom Moreland was appointed as the first security department director who also oversaw ambulance operations. The ambulances were driven by security hospital employee's who wore the uniform of the Atlanta Police Department and were commissioned as an Atlanta Police \\"Special Officer\\" and also wore a duty belt with firearm, handcuffs and flashlight. In the early 1950s Grady began using low-roof white over red International \\"Travelall\\" trucks as ambulances that had a single roof mounted beacon and a siren mounted on the front fender. There was only a stretcher, a fixed upright oxygen inhalator, a basic splint box and a \\"physicians black bag\\" as a first aid kit. Somewhere around the early 1960s, the ambulance service was being looked upon to provide basic first aid to stricken citizens especially when interns were becoming less available to respond. Tom Moreland later hired Julius Day who, at that time, was the director of safety Service for the local Red Cross Chapter on 5th Street, to become the first official director of the now newly created Grady Ambulance Service. The ambulances in those days were units 591, 592, 593, 594 and 595 and were dispatched by the Atlanta Police on Decatur Street. Atlanta citizens would either call Atlanta Police of Grady Hospital for an ambulance. The Police would notify the Grady Hospital operator by phone, who would then page the ambulance crew over the hospital's P.A. system to report to their ambulance. Upon entering the ambulance, the ambulance crew would then get the call from the police dispatcher. By the latter 1960s, the drivers had changed over to wearing a white shirt and gray pants with a black stripe and a drivers hat. The Grady ambulance attendants wore blue jeans with a White \\"interns\\" smock which displayed a large patch on the back of the smock that was emblazoned with the word \\"AMBULANCE\\" in red letters on a white background with a black border. On the left smock shoulder, the Grady Ambulance Service patch was worn which featured a red cross on a round patch with Grady Ambulance Service - Atlanta, GA in Black Lettering on a white background. Over the left front pocket was either an American Red Cross \\"Advanced First Aid\\" or \\"Instructor First Aid\\" patch, a black plastic engraved name plate over the right chest and an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) EMT patch on the right shoulder. In 1967, the ambulance service changed over to using low-roof Chevy \\"Carryall\\" trucks. During these years, Grady also established its own dedicated ambulance dispatchers and radio system. The dispatchers sat in a small room that was between the Surgical Emergency Clinic (SEC) and the Medical Emergency Clanic (MEC. The dispatcher sat on a stool and had window with a slit that opened to a small waiting room where all of the Grady drivers and attandants sat awaiting calls. The units operating in 1970 were Ambulance 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 since Grady only used even numbers to identify vehicles. Grady also depended on the J. Austin Dillon Funeral Home on Pryor Street (near downtown), Donahoo, and Hershel McDaniel Funeral Homes to run Grady backup calls on the Southside before private ambulance services began appearing in the late 1960s. The Frank Loundes Funeral Home (on 14th Street) ran back-up calls in the Northeast and the R.T. Patterson Funeral Home in the far Northwest before the legendary Metro Ambulance Service first opened on Spring Street in 1969 which took over all Northside backups when the funeral homes ceased their ambulance operations. The inner-city funeral homes of Haugabrooks, Cox Brothers, Hines, Handley and Pollard also ran both private family and Grady back-up ambulance calls in the inner-city downtown area as well as the inner-portion of the Northwest side of Atlanta. In 1972, Grady received its first 54\\" raised roof Chevrolet ambulances from Southern Ambulance Builders in LaGrange, Georgia as Ambulance #26, #28 and #30. Additional Southern vehicles of this type were placed in service as Ambulance #32, #34 and #36. In 1973, the service received three 54\\" raised roof Chevrolet \\"Zephyr\\" ambulances from the Modular Ambulance Corporation in Dallas, Texas as Ambulance #38, 40 and 42. Additional units replaced the original Zephyrs as Ambulance #44, 46, 48, and 54. In 1975, the service received its first raised roof van ambulances on a Dodge chassis from the Starliner Corporation in Florida as Ambulance #56, 58, 60, 62 and 64. The following year, Grady received delivery on three Dodge \\"Medicruiser\\" raised roof vans as paramedic units and Grady's initial paramedics completed training at Georgia's first paramedic class to be held at nearby Dekalb Community College. These vehicles were placed in service as Ambulance #66, #68 and #70. The Federal funded Regional EMS Project \\"Metropolitan Emergency Medical Services\\" (MEMS)also provided funding for complete radio/EKG telemetry systems for four of Grady's ambulances along with Life-Pak 4 defibrillator/scope/EKG units which were installed in Ambulance #56, #58, #66 and #68. In the 1970s Grady's uniform also changed to that of a light blue uniform style shirt and dark blue pants as well as a redesigned patch and the ambulance service was renamed to that of Grady EMS. In the latter 1970s Grady received its first modular ambulances from Southern Ambulance Builders and by the early 1980s, the service was mostly operating paramedic staffed Type I and Type III ambulances. In the latter 1970s, Julius Day stepped down as director to drive the new Neonatal transport ambulance \\"Angel 1\\" and Ted Smith took over as director. Later, Ted retired from Grady and Ray Hawkins became the next director of Grady EMS. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Grady EMS continued to enhance both in terms of EMS training, EMS technology and vehicles and continue as the primary EMS authority for the City of Atlanta and Fulton County with support from both the Emory University and Morehouse College Schools of Medicine. Today's Grady EMS Grady EMS provides advanced life support to any citizen or visitor in the City of Atlanta in Fulton County. Grady EMS staffs more than 350 personnel and maintains a fleet of more than 46 ALS ambulances. Grady EMS is one of the largest providers of pre-hospital care in the southeast handling approximately 100,000 requests annually for emergency services dispatched at the appropriate life-threatening response level as determined through Emergency Medical Dispatch. Grady EMS operates a high performance system with units strategically located throughout the city designed to optimize response times. Inter-facility transports are provided by the non-emergency division which handles an additional 20,000 calls annually. Other services provided include the Bike Response Unit, Critical Incident Stress Management Team, Tactical Support, Critical Care Transport Team, Field Training Officers and Neonatal Transport. Grady Fact Sheet 2009 Operations The Field Operations division includes all field staff deployed on the ALS and BLS 911 emergency ambulances. The ambulances are deployed using peak-load staffing and system status unit deployment. The shifts are 12-hour, 10-hour, and 8-hour fixed day‚Äôs schedules. At peak times, Grady deploys 22-ALS, 1-ALS Special Operation unit, and 3-BLS units. In addition to ambulances, Grady EMS deploys a District Supervisor and District Commander at all times and an Operations Manager during business hours. When available, an ALS Quick Response Vehicle (QRV) responds when needed and a paramedic Navigator is deployed to assist crews with hospital turn-times. Grady EMS through the non- emergency division provides all discharge and inter-facility transportation planning for the hospital which includes ambulatory vans, wheelchair vans and BLS units for stretcher patients. The Field Division transports patients to hospitals within the Atlanta area and specific Grady clinics through a new program called the Alternate Destination Care Program. Alternate Destination Care Program permits the field provider to transport stable ambulatory patients that meet specific criteria to one of the GHS ambulatory care clinics. The responding ambulance will be notified prior to arrival if the patient meets the EMD determinant code to qualify for the program. Upon arrival the field provider will complete an assessment and establish concordance with the EMD determinant. If the patient meets this concordance, the patient will be offered transport to one of four pre-selected ambulatory clinics. Should the field assessment result in discordance, the patient will be transported to an emergency department. Grady EMS recently completed the RAMPART seizure medication study. Special Operations Special Operations Paramedics are responsible for all of the Center for Disease Control's high- risk and hazardous materials transports. They provide the critical care transport services for Grady Health System. They are also responsible for providing tactical emergency medical support to designated law enforcement agencies. They also field a bike team staffed by medics to provide first response during major events in the City of Atlanta. Communications Grady‚Äôs communications center is a secondary public service answering point (PSAP) receiving all emergency calls through the city of Atlanta. Once received, our EMD trained dispatcher uses the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch protocol system that evaluates the patient‚Äôs condition and assists in appropriate allocation of resources. Based on the Medical Priority Dispatch System, ProQA is the EMD software package that guides the call taker through the process of collecting vital information with medically approved protocols until the dispatched unit arrives on scene. An estimated 100,000 emergency calls per year are processed using two dispatchers, four call takers and one supervisor per shift on a 12-hour rotating shift. Due to the growth of the 911 Communications Center, Grady EMS Communications relocated to an upgraded facility in February 2011. Grady‚Äôs EMS Communications Center is working toward becoming an Accredited Center of Excellence (ACE) through the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch. Upon achieving this very high standard, we will be one of three agencies in the state of Georgia, and one of only 153 agencies in the world. On Nov. 1, 2011, Grady EMS implemented the Nurse Advice Program. The Nurse Advice Program allows 911 callers who have been triaged by Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) as a low-level call to be transferred to a nurse, who can assist the caller by providing care. The primary goal of the Nurse Advice referral is to match non-life-threatening EMS calls to appropriate resources and expertise. The Nurse Advice nurse‚Äôs responsibilities include providing EMS callers with efficient medical resource and transportation options. New Training Lab Grady‚Äôs EMS Communications Center uses a state-of-the-art training lab to perform hands-on training to new and current employees. The lab is equipped with the Tri Tech CAD system, Pro QA and phone system to simulate real life emergencies in real time. Medical Direction Medical Direction for the all ALS service in Fulton County is provided by a team of doctors led by Dr. Arthur H. Yancey II, MD, MPH. Dr Yancey is an Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, and has served for more than a decade as an experienced member of the Emory Department of Emergency Medicine Section of Pre-Hospital and Disaster Medicine.

The Amidei, according to a tradition came from Rome, but lived in Florence since the foundation of the city. History The Amidei were a prominent family in Florence and Tuscany. They owned lands and a castle in Mugnana. The family business began as production of olive oil and wine, and had developed into banking. In fact there was one or more wills in which the father stated he was leaving some credits that had to be withdrawn. In 1182, Bongianni of the Amidei was a Florentine councillor. In the early thirteenth century, the Amidei were allied with the Ghibelline faction, led by the Uberti and Lamberti families. Their stronghold was on via Por San Maria, which connected the Ponte Vecchio to the Mercato Nuovo and Mercato Vecchio. The remains of their tower, Torre degli Amidei, can still be seen. Saverio Altamura. The Amidei are best remembered for a particular event during the Guelf and Ghibelline conflicts. In 1215, during a banquet celebrating the ennoblement of a young Florentine, one of the guests, Buondelmonte de' Buondelmonti, stabbed a rival in the arm. In restitution for the injury and dishonor, the elders decided that young Buondelmonte should wed a girl from the Amidei. That arranged, the Amidei and Buondelmonti families arranged an engagement ceremony, where Buondelmonte was to publicly pledge troth to the Amidei girl. With the Amidei assembled in the piazza, the young Buondelmonte man rode past the Amidei, and instead asked for the hand of a girl from the Donati family, members of the Guelf faction. Furious, the Amidei and allies plotted revenge. They debated whether they should scar Buondelmonte's face, beat him up, or kill him. Mosca di Lamberti took the floor and argued that they should kill him at the place where he had dishonoured them. His famous words, 'cosa fatta capo ha', were recorded in Dante's Inferno and an earlier chronicle known as Pseudo-Latini. On Easter morning on his way to marry the Donati girl, as Buondelmonte crossed the Ponte Vecchio, he was waylaid by the Amidei and their allies, and murdered. The Buondelmonte murder and its associated clan rivalry became the legendary origin of the Guelf and Ghibelline conflict in Florence, but early 14th century chroniclers, including Dino Compagni and Giovanni Villani, manipulated the story to lay blame for the conflict on one group or another.*The Chronicle of Dino Compagni: Translated by Else C. M. Benecke and A. G. Ferrers Howell, Publisher JM Dent and Co., Aldine House , London, 1906, pages 5-6. On 20 April 1749, Maddalena Amidei married Carlo Barbiellini and they agreed to keep her name, since she was one of the last descendants of the Amidei. Legend The family descended from the family of Cotius or Cozzi, who, always according to a legend, descended from the Gens Julia family, of which Julius Caesar was part. Marcus Julius Cottius was a king in the Cottian Alps, whose alliance with the Emperor Augustus is recorded on a stone arch in Susa, Piedmont. The Amidei were related to the Piccolomini for a certain Giulius Piccolominis Amideis, and as soon as they knew that their relatives descended from the Gens Julia, they decided to call one of them Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who became Pope Pius II, and his nephew became Pope Pius III. Saint Amadeus Santissima Annunziata, in which Amadio resuscitates a drowned boy One of the Amidei was called Bartholomeus Amadeus of the Amidei and was one of the seven saint founders of a religious congregation, that spread worldwide, especially in Germany, the Servites. He moved from Florence to Mount Senarius (18 km away from the city), with his six friends, in order to be left alone and to concentrate on his devotion to God. He died on 12 February 1266, and according to the legend, the other Father Founders saw a flame rising to the sky as a symbol of his love for God. In 1888 he, along with the six saints, was sanctified by Pope Leo XIII. Coat of arms Their coat of arms consists in a gold shield with three red stripes on it.

In 1800 there was a wedding of Filippo Barbiellini Amidei with a Lelmi or L'elmi, a rich family that only had a female issue, and in order to maintain their name, they came to an agreement so that the last name could be kept and would become Barbiellini Amidei Lelmi. The Barbiellinis still live mainly in Rome and Elba.  Notable figures  A Count Alessandro Barbiellini Amidei was mentioned in historical records transacting with representatives of the Benedictines who wanted to construct a monastery and school of Sant' Anselmo in Rome. Having heard of the difficulty in finding an appropriate and viable site for the edifice, the count volunteered to sell a property he owned, which was a wedge-shaped site on the western peak of the Aventine beside a parcel of land owned by the Knights of Malta. The deal was concluded swiftly and to this day, it is the home to the Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino church, monastery, and college. The Count Bernardo Barbiellini Amidei emerged as an important political figure between 1920 and 1940. He was the son of the daughter of Anna Rosa Gattorno, who was beatified in the 9th of April 2000. Count Bernardo was the founder of a school in Naples, which teaches oriental languages. In his honor, a street in Rome was named after him. He was also ian adherent of fascism and credited to have founded one of the earliest dopolavoros on record in Italy. An account revealed that by 1923, the count and his cohorts were the undisputed arbiter of the life of the province of Piacenza and \\"were now dedicating themselves to social work and worker education and presided over cultural, educational, and welfare associations of singular importance.\\" The children of Bernardo Barbiellini Amidei with the Countess Anna Maria Pull√® are (in descending age order): * Rosanna Barbiellini Amidei, an Italian art historian; * Gaspare Barbiellini Amidei, a famous Italian journalist and writer; * Guido Barbiellini Amidei, a famous Italian physicist, involved in the discovery of the top quark; * Silvia Barbiellini Amidei; and, * Carla Barbiellini Amidei. One of the possessions of the Barbiellinis was a mansion in the center of Rome which was then sold at the end of the nineteenth century to the State and a palace in Placense. In Elba island, another mansion was given first to Napoleon and then it was transformed into a museum. The family is now very numerous and is even related to a marquise, Clarice Barbiellini Amidei de' Medici Tornaquinci, who descended from the family of the Medici Tornaquinci of Florence. A castle in San Martino was then sold from the husband in the second marriage, to a rich owner of an industry who later on donated it to the Church. The family's villa at San Martino in Elba was sold to a convent and is now the Park Hotel Napoleone, a 4-star hotel. Some properties and a few castles still remain part of the Barbiellini family.
