It contains about 1300 species including the Old World warblers, Old World babblers, swallows, larks and bulbuls. Members of the clade are found worldwide, but fewer species are present in the Americas. Systematics The superfamily Sylvioidea was first proposed in 1990 in the Sibley‚ÄìAhlquist taxonomy of birds based on DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization experiments. More recent studies based on comparison of DNA sequences have failed to support the inclusion of some families such as Certhiidae (treecreepers), Sittidae (nuthatches), Paridae (tits and chickadees) and Regulidae (goldcrests and kinglets) but instead support the addition of Alaudidae (larks). Some of the families within the Sylvioidea have been greatly redefined. In particular, the Old World warbler family Sylviidae and Old World babbler family Timaliidae were used as wastebin taxa and included many species which have turned out not to be closely related. Several new families have been created and some species have been moved from one family to another.Boyd, John H. (2010): Sylvioidea, Aves ‚Äî A Taxonomy in Flux. Retrieved 2010-01-07.

It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. History The Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, opened an academy in the Washington Heights section of New York City in September 1889. The classes included were grades 1 through 12. At that time, the first academy resembled the large estates which surrounded it. Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school. The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students. Facilities were not sufficient even with this change, so it was necessary to build a much larger school. In the fall of 1953 the old building was sold and the academy moved to its present location at 2250 Williamsbridge Road. The school continues to undergo a series of renovations and improvements. The present enrollment of St. Catharine Academy is approximately 500 girls. Sisters of Mercy St. Catharine Academy is a high school sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy of the Regional Community of New York. Annual tuition is approximately $10,000. There is also an annual general fee of $700, which covers calculators per student, paper supplies, report cards, student IDs, and other necessities. Accreditation St. Catharine Academy is chartered by the Board of Regents of the State of New York and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Mercy Secondary Education Association and the National Catholic Education Association. Programs for each student are planned to meet the requirements of the New York State Education Department.

This is achieved by simplifying the task of coding to allow focus on the business task being coded. Based on the context of the code, content assist provides the developer with a list of accessible keywords according to a programming language specification, variable, methods, data types, ...  Autocomplete  Autocomplete allows quickly typing names in the context of the code. It can be further improved to assist the developer. For example, in an XML context, when the developer types an opening tag \\"<\\" he is offered a list of tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the closing tag. Other autocomplete techniques exist. For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can just type in the first letter if lowercase and the uppercase letters from a type/variable name then press Ctrl+space to be offered all the choices that match the entered letters that are valid for the current context (class name, interface name, variable or field names).  Code snippet / Code templates  Code snippets allow the developer to add a complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code snippets can only be used in a valid context (statements snippets are only offered when you can insert statements). For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can type in \\"instanceof\\" then press Ctrl+space which will replace \\"instanceof\\" by the following code snippet: if (obj instanceof MyClass) { MyClass myClazz = (MyClass) obj; } This code snippet can be further customised by the developer, with the IDE placing the cursor: # on the \\"obj\\" variable to choose between the available variables at this point, # on the \\"MyClass\\" type to allow the developer to choose the type, after he pressed the tab key, # on the \\"myClass\\" variable to allow the developer to rename the local variable, after he pressed the tab key, # on line 3 to allow the developer to continue typing the rest of the code, after he pressed the tab key.

Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the town's Winter Gardens and all three Blackpool piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues. In 2000, a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester. At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta. By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony. At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to- month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver. A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear. The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long- time rival Luminar Leisure. All that remains of the corporation as of 2007 is the Esporta health and fitness chain.

Gillis van Stralen, Antonie's father, was a textile merchant. The family originated in Weert but moved between 1584-1590 to Gorkum, presumably because of Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma's armies marching through the area. We don't hear much from Anthonie Verstraelen, until 1635 when he married Catalijntje van Oosten from Antwerp. The location of the wedding is unknown. The couple went to live in Oude Spiegelstraat, near Singel. In Amsterdam Antonie got into a dispute with the Sint Lucasgilde, for its laxness in allowing in too many non-citizen painters. In 1641 he was buried in the Westerkerk. In 1644 his two children inherited two hundred guilder each from the sale of their father's paintings. The paintings must have been sold very cheap.

The Commission on Secondary Schools of the Middle States Association first granted the academy accreditation effective 2003‚Äì2010. In 2009‚Äì2010, the academy completed the review for re-accreditation and received the renewal of certification. Accreditation has been renewed until December 2017.  History  St. Raymond Academy was established in 1960 by the Sisters of Charity, a congregation of religious women in the Catholic Church whose primary missions are education and nursing. For nearly 200 years, the Sisters of Charity of New York have served the needs of the poor. The congregation's history began with its foundress, Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was later canonized as the first American-born saint. Since Saint Raymond Academy for Girls opened its doors, its motto has been \\"Commitment to Excellence\\". St. Raymond Academy for Girls began as a small, parish-based high school with an enrollment of 95 students. Msgr. John Corrigan, the pastor at the time, appointed Sr. Regina Angela, a Sister of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, as the first principal. The school occupied the third floor of the school building built in 1952 and through the years has prided itself on serving a relatively small school population. In order to better meet its educational goals, the school was recognized with a NYS Board of Regents Charter in 1965 and with an additional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 2003, which was recently renewed. The Sisters of Charity were joined through the years by the Sisters of St. Dominic Blauvelt and Sparkill, the Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of the Holy Child, and lay women and men.  Academics  The school's program of studies is primarily college-oriented, with business, computer and science electives included in upper years. In addition to preparing students for a New York State Regents Diploma with four-year programs in English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Spanish and Science, the school also offers Advanced Placement courses in English Literature and Composition, United States History and Government, and Spanish Literature and Language.

There are numerous historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens, chemical substances used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context. Common era A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old. New World The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well- documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia. Olmec entheogens The Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens: #Burials of Bufo toads with priests #The use of entheogens in later Olmec-inspired cultures #Sculptures of shamans and other figures have strong Therianthropic imagery. Maya The Maya (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way. The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b, \\"Mushroom Stones of Middle America,\\" in Mushrooms, Russia and History by Valentina P. Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson, eds. N.T.) Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi: > \\"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is > based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at > Kaminaljuyu.

Mound E-III-3, > Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology & History No. > 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de > Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 ) The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendants of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today. Aztec The Aztec entheogenic complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonan√°catl (translated as ‚Äúmushroom of the gods,\\" a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs. Native Americans of the southwest United States There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences. Old World= Paleolithic During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the \\"Flower Burial\\" in Shanidar Cave, a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from Tassili, Algeria cave paintings depicting Psilocybe mairei mushrooms dated 7000 to 9000 years Reprinted at ArtePreistorica.com before present. From this region, there are several therianthropic images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited effect of many psychedelic drugs, Ego death or unity). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom. There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired. Mesolithic A cave painting in Spain has been interpreted as depicting Psilocybe hispanica.

New operators will take over beginning September 2016. History The upon which the golf course was built has always been devoted to recreation in some form or another. The original architect was James Harrison Smith. Originally part of the \\"Lucky\\" Baldwin Ranch, Santa Anita's history dates back to the days when its broad oaks sheltered places where Indians camped. Across its broad acres traveled Mission Fathers from San Gabriel on their way up Little Santa Anita Canyon for lumber needed to build the Mission. From 1907 through 1909 horse racing was a feature on Lucky Baldwin's famed track. The clubhouse turn was right where No. 16 is now and when you're on the hill on the backside of No. 14, that's the turn where the horses turned for home. World War I Years Hangars from the U.S. Army's Ross Field Balloon School, 1922. The site of the hangars is now the 4th hole on the Santa Anita Golf Course During World War I, Ross Field, Named after Lt. Cleo J. Ross of the U.S. Army Air Service, housed a United States Army balloon school. Ross was an observer with the 8th Balloon Company and was killed in action in France on September 26, 1918, the only U.S. Army balloonist to die in combat. The balloon school closed in the spring on 1919. Anita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club. Depression Era In 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex. The Course Opens The Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938. 1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open‚Äîheld each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of \\"The Open\\" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70. The Course Changes In the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes. As part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened. During the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play. The Course Record The current record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. Moore is attributed with the current record as mentioned above several holes have been changed since \\"The Open\\" era and the course is now a par 71 rather than the original par 70.

It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading. Location and origins Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor. Buildings and structures The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road.  Electoral ward  The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards. As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four. In the 2011, 2012 and 2014 a Labour Party candidate won each election. These Councillors are currently, in order of election: Graeme Hoskin, Jo Lovelock and Debs Absolom.2014 results Reading Borough Council2011 results Reading Borough Council References Category:Suburbs of Reading, Berkshire Category:Tilehurst Category:Wards of Reading ","title":"Norcot"},{"id":"12678324","text":"George M.

The school fields 16 sports teams ‚Äì seven men and nine women ‚Äì and compete in the Mountain West Conference. Background The first intercollegiate athletic event in the school's history took place on November 25, 1892, when the Agriculturalists defeated the football team from the University of Utah, 12-0. The football program has a rich history (Merlin Olsen and Phil Olsen are alumni) throughout the mid-20th century, but has struggled lately, following two ill-fated stints as an independent program and two more years in the geographically distant Sun Belt Conference, after the Big West Conference, which had housed the Aggies since 1978, elected to stop sponsoring football in 2001. USU's other teams remained in that conference until the school was invited to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2005. USU had lobbied to join its in-state rivals Utah and BYU in the WAC for many decades prior to 2005, but were only allowed in after the two other schools had left to form the Mountain West Conference. Subsequently both Utah and BYU departed the Mountain West Conference and USU was invited to join that conference, where they currently reside. Recently, the men's basketball team, under coach Stew Morrill, has become a nationally respected program, with several conference championships and trips to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The basketball program has been one of the most successful programs in the country since 2000, winning at least 23 games in each season, many conference championships, and appearing in the NCAA tournament numerous times. In fact, many Aggie sports have been extremely successful for many years, though this is often overlooked due to the recent futility of the football team. Utah State's logo used from 2000 until 2012 Following the great heights of the 1960s and 70's, Aggie football has fallen upon hard times in recent decades, leading to a disproportionate lack of USU sports coverage in statewide and national media. Many of the Aggie faithful attribute the decline to administrators at both Utah and BYU freezing then- superior USU out of the newly formed WAC. However, other factors cited as leading to the decline include a failure to upgrade facilities until recently, a lack of donors to athletics, and the complacency of past athletics directors. The futility of the football program has had an extremely negative effect on the perception of the university as a whole, and it is something that the Aggies are only now recovering from. 2011 saw the first winning season in many years, a bowl game, and in May 2012, an invitation to the Mountain West Conference, which will give USU its first stable, promising conference home in a half-century. However, former athletic director Scott Barnes recently inked deals with TV stations, replaced the head football coach, raised funds, and accomplished numerous necessary reorganizations, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and conference schools. In large part due to his efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses. The Aggies brought in WAC championships in five sports during the 2008‚Äì09 academic year, tied for the most in school history. Football Maverik Stadium during a USU vs. BYU game, September 29, 2017 As of January 2016, Aggie football has an overall record of 547‚Äì533‚Äì31 (.506) After many years of futility, the Aggies experienced a renaissance under head coach Gary Andersen, who replaced Brent Guy following the 2008 season. The 2011 campaign was the team's first winning season in many years, resulting in a postseason bowl berth. 2012 has brought the school's first-ever 10-win season and WAC championship (its first outright conference championship since 1936), and national Top 25 rankings in all three major polls. Andersen left USU after the 2012 season and has been replaced by his former offensive coordinator Matt Wells. The Aggies have played in eight bowl games in their history, winning three. The team's first victory came in the 1993 Las Vegas Bowl against Ball State. The team has made three consecutive bowl appearances, the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, in 2011 and 2012, and the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, in 2013. The team lost to Ohio in the 2011 edition and defeated Toledo 41‚Äì15 in the 2012 edition. In 2013 USU defeated Northern Illinois University in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl. USU football is played at Maverik Stadium, which seats 25,100. Other men's sports The men's cross country team has been impressive in recent years, winning the WAC title for the past five years in a row‚Äîeach year since joining the WAC. Members of the team have garnered numerous conference and regional awards, and have competed in the NCAA Championships. Likewise, the men's track and field team has long enjoyed success, with a bevy of All- American athletes from decades past. In recent years, the team has also won WAC championships in 2007, 2009, and 2010 (outdoor) and 2008 and 2010 (indoor). Golf has spent many years attempting to return to the heights achieved in the early 1980s by alum Jay Don Blake. As a member of the Aggie golf squad, Blake won the NCAA Championship in 1980 and was named NCAA Player of the Year in 1981. He turned pro that year, and in 1987 joined the PGA Tour, where he has one victory and several top-10 finishes, mostly in the early '90s. He has won three times on the Champions Tour. The tennis team has a difficult time attracting major recruits due to the lack of indoor on-campus facilities. The team trains and plays its home matches at an upscale local gym. Despite this deficiency, the team has produced a number of athletes who have won all-conference honors in recent years, drawing from both local and international talent pools. Women's sports Of women's sports at USU, gymnastics has probably been most successful historically, heading to the postseason 26 times, including five trips to the national championships. The soccer team has been successful as of late, finishing the 2008 season with a perfect record in conference play, as well as a WAC title. Despite falling in the conference tournament in 2009, Aggie soccer landed three players on the All-WAC first team. Women's volleyball and softball are two of the sports at USU that boast of national championships in their history. In 1978 the Aggie volleyball team defeated UCLA to win the AIAW Large College volleyball national championship. The following year, the team fell to Hawaii in the championship match. The Aggie softball team has appeared in four Women's College World Series, in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1984, winning the AIAW Division I softball national championship in 1980 and 1981. Neither team has returned to such heights in recent years, though each has been consistently good. The women's tennis team struggles with the same disadvantages as the men's. The women's basketball program began rebuilding in 2003 after a 16-year absence. At the time, USU was the only Division I school that did not have a women's basketball program besides the mostly male Virginia Military Institute and The Citadel.Rebuilding Utah State program, step by small step, https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/womensbasketball/bigwest/2002-10-16-cover- utah-state_x.htm It took eight years for Utah State to post a winning record, finishing the 2010‚Äì11 season at 16‚Äì15 after reaching the second round of the WNIT. The 2011‚Äì12 team finished 21‚Äì10 for the first 20-win season in school history, exiting the WNIT in the first round. Following the season, Raegan Pebley, who had been head coach since the return of the sport, was hired away by Fresno State, with Jerry Finkbeiner being hired as her replacement. Facilities Romney Stadium from outside the south entrance The most used sports venue is the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics events are held. TV and radio announcers visiting the Smith Spectrum for the first time commonly state that the spectrum is one of the loudest basketball venues in the country with one of the most enthusiastic crowds in the country, rivaling Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University. It is a tradition that near the beginning of games the crowd chooses one player from the other team who commits a blatant foul, taunts the crowd, etc., and every time that player touches the ball the entire crowd boos loudly until he passes the ball. This pressure on opposing players created by this tradition has cut many outstanding players down to below average while at the Spectrum. The football team plays in Maverik Stadium, slightly north and west of the main campus. The stadium had natural grass until 2004, when artificial turf was installed. Romney Stadium is built on a hillside, and appears much smaller from outside than it actually is, as much of the seating and the field are below street level. In 2009, the field at Romney Stadium was named Merlin Olsen Field, in honor of the Hall of Fame alumnus. Aggie name and mascot The name Aggies, short for Agriculturalists, is a fixture of many universities that began as land-grant and agricultural colleges. Early USU sports teams were sometimes simply referred to as the \\"Farmers\\" as well as the Aggies, though the former name was never official. Beginning in the 1930s, an image of a \\"bean-pole farmer\\" with a pitchfork in hand and hay stalk in mouth began to be used to represent the college, though this too was never made official, and disappeared following the transformation into a full-fledged university in 1957. During the late 1960s and early '70s, a movement began on campus to shed the Aggie name in favor of the Utah State Highlanders, but the movement met with widespread opposition and was abandoned. The name \\"Highlanders\\" was a nod to the university's historic ideological tie to Scotland, which came about very early on in the college's history, mostly due to the university's setting on a hill in a high mountain valley. In fact, for a brief period, USU's teams were indeed nicknamed the \\"Scotsmen\\" as well, and a remnant of this era lives on in the current and popular fight song \\"The Scotsman\\". Big Blue A November 7, 1901 meeting decided that the college's official color would be blue. It originated as more of a royal blue, morphing fully into navy by the 1920s. The term \\"Big Blue\\" came about in the 1960s simply to refer to the uniform color, as opposed to any particular mascot. The image of a bull first appeared on a football game program in 1975, and the following year it was adopted as USU's mascot. For a few years, USU used an actual white bull, painted blue, which was brought to sporting events and corralled on the sidelines. However, when the Smith Spectrum was built, there were concerns with the bull ruining the floor. For a short time, the bull was outfitted with red rubber boots, which did not pan out and the bull was retired. In 1987 USU Student Athletics Vice President John Mortensen decided that Utah State should still have a mascot and spent $750 on a costume for Big Blue. The costume was somewhat of a disappointment because it was royal blue, not navy, had real animal horns, and was not easy to move around in. The costume has since undergone at least one redesign, but is now one of the most active and recognized college mascots in the region. Possibly Big Blue's most well-known antic was his tradition of rappelling from the JumboTron to kick off team introductions for men's basketball games. He also enjoys crowdsurfing. As of 2003, four of the six people who had played the Big Blue role had gone on to become mascots for professional sports teams. The Hurd The HURD is the student section at Utah State University. The HURD started in 2006 and has grown every year since. Beginning as a club in the USU Student Association, the HURD moved to total inclusion of the entire USU student body in the summer of 2012. At capacity, the HURD fills 6,500 seats at Romney Stadium for USU Football and 4,000 seats in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum for USU Basketball. The HURD helps organize major activities, with leadership and help from the HURD Committee, such as tailgates, camp outs, away game watch parties and more for the student body and community. Drawing from its motto \\"Be Seen. Be Loud. Be HURD!\\", the HURD ensures that the teams who visit Utah State University will experience the best atmosphere in the country for collegiate athletics by being known as one of the craziest student sections in the country. Fight songs=Hail the Utah Aggies The Aggies' principal fight song is known as \\"Hail the Utah Aggies\\" as well as simply \\"Fight Song\\". It was composed in 1933 by Mickey Hart, with words by Darwin Jepsen and Mark Hart. The main verse is sung twice, with the chant once in between. The Scotsman The popular Scotsman song was composed by student Ebenezer J. Kirkham, class of 1918. At athletic events, \\"The Scotsman\\" is often sung immediately following \\"Hail the Utah Aggies\\". The words are sung twice through without a break, accompanied by synchronized arm gestures originally created by a small students in Section K of the Spectrum in the early 90s to represent milking of a cow by hand eventually spread to the entire student section. The motions are yet another example of USU students ingenuity creating longstanding traditions at sporting events. During the final words of the second \\"verse\\", the students' pitch often rises to a full-out yell. Show me the Scotsman who doesn't love the thistle. Show me the Englishman who doesn't love the rose. Show me the true blooded Aggie from Utah Who doesn't love the spot . . . Where the sagebrush grows!

The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland. In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. Nuoli had the ace of hearts, Vinha the ace of clubs, Sy√∂ksy the ace of diamonds, and Raju the ace of spades. Combat history On 6 July 1941 Sy√∂ksy and Vinha sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead Sy√∂ksy dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond. On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. Vinha was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while Sy√∂ksy made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it. On 1 September 1941 Sy√∂ksy and Vinha were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. Sy√∂ksy torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS Meero, 1,866 tons). On 22 September 1941 Sy√∂ksy sank the Soviet minehunter T-41 (Kirov) east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with Vinha. On 1 October 1941 Nuoli participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from Sisu that sank the target. Sy√∂ksy, Vinha and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. Sy√∂ksy managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank.

It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed Bloodhound) was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team. Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).  History  The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger. Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non- cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound- Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename Bloodhound). Network Monitor 3 is a complete overhaul of the earlier Network Monitor 2.x version. Originally versions of Network Monitor were only available through other Microsoft products, such as Systems Management Server (SMS). But now the fully featured product with public parsers is available as a free download.

Day (August 8, 1853 ‚Äì September 12, 1927) was a career American army officer who received the Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military decoration, for his actions during the American Indian Wars in the latter half of the 19th century. Day was a longtime officer with the African- American 9th Cavalry Regiment, seeing action during the Apache Wars against the Apache leaders Victorio and Geronimo. Day later achieved fame as a marksman while participating in the U.S. Army's annual rifle marksmanship contest, and served in the Philippines during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. He eventually rose to the rank of colonel and served as the commander of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry. West Point Mathias Walter Day was the second of seven children of Mathias Day (the founder of Daytona Beach, Florida) and Mary Blymyer, both native Ohioans. He was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1873. A graduate of the class of 1877 alongside Henry Ossian Flipper, the first African-American to graduate from West Point, Day was popular with his classmates, but was \\"ranked close enough to the bottom to be assigned to a black regiment\\".Kenner, page 193. Kuhl, et al. states that Day \\"stood near the foot of the West Point Class of 1877 at graduation, but near its head in popularity\\". Kuhl, et al., page 3. Retrieved on August 7, 2007. However Gott in endnote 23 of \\"In search of an elusive enemy: the Victorio Campaign\\" states that Day was ranked seventh. Gott, page 48. Day was not assigned to the 9th Cavalry Regiment until August 1878. The 9th Cavalry was one of four African-American regiments which became known as the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\". Day was ordered to El Paso, Texas, where he assumed command of A Troop. Service in the American Indian Wars In 1879, Day and his troop were transferred west to New Mexico where they joined the rest of the regiment. After the Apache chief Victorio launched two successful raids on 9th Cavalry outposts near the Warm Springs Reservation after he left the San Carlos Reservation on August 21, the rest of the regiment was mobilized to go after him, marking the beginning of the Victorio Campaign. On the morning of September 18, Day, along with Captain Byron Dawson and twenty-two men of Troops A and B together with three Navajo Scouts, were following Victorio's trail through Las Animas Canyon in New Mexico. Here, they fell into an ambush, with the Apache above them on three sides of the canyon pinning them down with rifle fire. They were subsequently reinforced by two companies led by Captain Charles Beyer, which made contact with them but were unable to drive the Apaches from their positions. By the end of the day, the trapped troopers were running low on ammunition. His own ammunition supply running short, Beyer ordered a withdrawal and had Dawson withdraw his men under covering fire to avoid encirclement. Day noticed two wounded men caught out in the open some distanceGott gives \\"about\\" for Jeremiah Crump, the man rescued by Day. Gott, page 21. Kenner gives the distance as away for Alfred Freeland, who was helped by Denny. Kenner, page 194 from their position, exposed to enemy fire and unable to move. Assisted by Sergeant John Denny, who helped support one man, Day carried the other on his back through \\"a hail of bullets so thick it seemed 'no one could pass this open rocky space alive'\\" to safety.Kenner, page 194. Despite his heroism, Captain Beyer was furious with Day for disobeying orders and his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Dudley, wanted to court-martial him. However, Day was later cleared by a board of inquiryGott, page 21 and subsequently received the Medal of Honor on May 7, 1890. John Denny and Second Lieutenant Robert Temple Emmet, who like Day had graduated from West Point in 1877, also received the Medal of Honor for their actions at Las Animas Canyon. Following Las Animas Canyon, the 9th Cavalry continued its pursuit of Victorio, but he was able to escape across the Mexican border. Taking a break from campaigning, Day was married on Thanksgiving Day, 1879, to Emilia Schultz, his wedding attended by Governor Lew Wallace.Kenner, page 196 He resumed campaigning against Victorio in 1880, but apart from two actions in which he was involved in the early part of the year, served as a staff adjutant and later returned to command of A Troop, seeing little action. Victorio was later killed by Mexican forces in October. In late 1881, the 9th Cavalry was transferred to the Southern Plains. Day was promoted to first lieutenant in 1884 and assigned to I Troop, which was stationed at Fort Reno near present-day Oklahoma City. The troop was responsible for removing white settlers known as \\"Boomers\\" from the Unassigned Lands located in the middle of what is now the state of Oklahoma. During this time, Day became something of a celebrity through his skill as a marksman by winning the annual rifle marksmanship contest for the U.S. Army's Division of the Missouri.This army territorial division covered \\"roughly everything between Chicago and the Continental Divide\\". Kenner, page 202. He also captained the team which represented the Division of the Missouri in competition against opposing teams from the Divisions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and artillery. The team won the long-distance target shooting competition and Day himself was acknowledged to be \\"'the best skirmisher'\\" when involved in a competition that involved \\"shooting at targets under conditions 'that were an approximation to actual service'\\".Kenner, page 202‚Äì203. In early 1885, the 9th Cavalry was reposted to Wyoming and Nebraska. Day volunteered for service with the Apache scouts when he learned that the army was in need of officers with desert experience. He participated in a lengthy, strenuous pursuit of Geronimo later in the year that engaged the Apache leader twice and nearly captured him once.Kenner, page 205‚Äì206. Day was eventually reassigned to the 9th Cavalry and served as its regimental quartermaster, a position that he held after the close of the Indian Wars in 1890. Later career Day's headstone at San Francisco National Cemetery From 1891 to 1895, Day was professor of Military Science and Tactics at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio. After the United States declared war on Spain on April 21, 1898, Captain Day was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of volunteers and assigned to command the 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, which had been reactivated after being mustered out at the end of the American Civil War. The 1st Ohio was a part of the Second Cavalry Brigade which included among its regiments the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, better known as the Rough Riders. The 1st Ohio reported to Port Tampa, Florida on July 12, for transportation to Cuba, but its sailing was delayed due to a shortage of transports and as a result, the regiment did not see action in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Day however, later saw action in the Philippines against the Moros. After postings to various units, he served as the colonel of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry, for a year before retiring from the army in 1912. Day died on September 12, 1927, in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in the San Francisco National Cemetery. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Second Lieutenant, 9th U.S. Cavalry.

Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 ‚Äì 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province.  Biography  Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871. Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evang√©lica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law's company which was now renamed, Ernesto Tornquist y Cia. With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, Refineria Argentina, in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the Bieckert brewery, the Seeber margarine manufacturer and the Bianchetti scale manufacturer. Marriott Plaza Hotel On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company Sansinena and its cold- storage plant La Negra in Riachuelo and set up the plant Cuartreros in Bah√≠a Blanca. Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the Compa√±√≠a Argentina de Pesca, oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital. Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil. In 1903 he built the estancia, Sierra de la Ventana, in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays. He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910). In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires. He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.  References  * Ernesto Tornquist, por Fernando M.

After a successful trial period at the club, he signed a contract to be a part of Stan Ternent's squad in 2001. 'King Arthur', as he was effectively nicknamed, became a firm fans' favourite at the club with his dominant displays and his excellent runs up the field from defence. His finest hour was in a local derby away at Preston North End. He stunned the Lilywhites with two goals, including one from a classy set up from Alan Moore. He was a constant fixture in the Burnley team during the 2001/2002 season, where Burnley looked likely to gain promotion to the Premier League.  Queens Park Rangers  Gnoh√©r√© failed to live up to his early form at Burnley in the following seasons and was subsequently released when his contract expired. He joined Queens Park Rangers after an initial loan, but left the club at the end of the 2004/05 season. During his spell at QPR, he scored once in the Football League Trophy against Kidderminster Harriers.  Oxford United  After a spell out of the game, Gnoh√©r√© signed for Oxford United in August 2007. However, after a string of poor performances for the U's and the return of regular defenders from injury, the club decided not to renew his month-to-month contract, and he was released on October 2007.

It is the longest running magazine in the Russian language. The first issue was printed in Saint Petersburg, in December 1861, almost thirty years before the establishment of the National Geographic Magazine. Thus, it is one of the oldest popular science magazines in the world. Release of Vokrug sveta was suspended twice: from 1918 to 1927, during the Russian Revolution, and from 1941 to 1945, during World War II. Nevertheless, the magazine always resumed and continues to be published to this day. History=Before the Revolution The magazine was conceived by a Warsaw-born entrepreneur, Boleslaw Wolf, who defined Vokrug Sveta as a lavishly illustrated yearly publication, dedicated to \\"physical geography, natural sciences, the most recent discoveries, inventions and observations\\". Its roster of authors included: Alfred Brehm, Camille Flammarion, Nikolai Przhevalsky and Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai. The Wolf edition was discontinued after 1868 for unclear reasons, but the project of a popular geographical journal was revived in 1885 by Ivan Sytin, a printer who directed his periodicals toward a wider audience. Sytin's Vokrug sveta was issued monthly and featured original translations of popular adventure fiction from such authors as Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle. Sergey Parkhomenko, the magazine's editor-in-chief, showing a digitized 1867 edition of Vokrug sveta After the Revolution The Russian Revolution brought this period of the magazine's history to an abrupt termination. Like many other periodicals of Imperial Russia, Vokrug sveta suspended publication for ten years. It was back in print under the auspices of the Young Communist League, specifically targeted toward the youth audience. Contributing editors included some of the finest Soviet science fiction authors, including Alexander Belayev, Vladimir Obruchev and Ivan Yefremov. In 1938, the magazine's headquarters relocated, from Leningrad to Moscow and its publication was altogether suspended during World War II. For Soviet readers, Vokrug sveta represented a rare source of authentic, fully illustrated information about foreign cultural attractions. This is despite the insistence of Soviet officials that the magazine should cover domestic tourist attractions, rather than those situated outside the USSR. In the 1960s and 1970s, the magazine continued to grow in popularity and increased the circulation to 2,300,000 copies by 1971. A television subsidiary was also popular, particularly in the early 1990s. As of 2007, Vokrug sveta ranks third among Russia's popular monthlies, with a circulation hovering around 250,000. The free archives of past issues (starting from 1970) are available on their website.

History The current church in Narborough dates from the 13th century, although it is highly probable an even earlier church dating back to the 10th century or before stood on or near the site. A Saxon hogback tombstone was found near the church and is on display at the Jewry Wall Museum in Leicester. The church was largely rebuilt in 1856‚Äì1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area. The church includes a number of memorials/windows to the Everard family. The original Norman south porch was rebuilt in 1860 at a cost of ¬£60. The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door. In the actual churchyard there is a gravestone to a Harry Baker who died aged 49 in 1901 after being \\"thrown from a trap\\". Current status The parish is part of the benefice of Narborough and Huncote, within the Diocese of Leicester. The church has weekly Sunday services and other events, including a yearly Christmas Tree Festival. The church is normally locked, but regular events and open days are held. All Saints' Church itself is a Grade II* listed building.

History The current church is believed to have existed since at least 1256, and thought to have been commissioned by Roger Le Peytevin of Altofts Hall.Dodsworth's Yorkshire Notes. The Wapentake of Agbrigg, Printed for the Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Association, 1884 However, a prior church is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is likely that the current church stands on the lines of the original. In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland. The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation. Notable monuments and contents The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield. His benefice still provides funding for the current secondary school in Normanton, the Freeston Business and Enterprise College. In 1906, a medieval altar slab bearing five incised crosses was found under the sanctuary floor, where it had probably lain since the reformation. It now stands in the Lady Chapel and is used for weekly Eucharist. There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave. The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War. The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts. All Saints' possesses two ancient silver cups, now housed in a collection at York Minster. The oldest was made in London in 1655 and is inscribed \\"Normanton cupp 1674\\". The second is two-handled porringer inscribed \\"The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699\\" In \\"Normanton, Past and Present,\\" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: \\"The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton.

The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets. On the wall above the tomb is an undated tablet recording that 'Mrs. Elizabeth Levett made benefaction for the poor of Normanton and Snydale, and for teaching poor children.'Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica, Joseph Jackson Howard (ed.), Vol. I, Third Series, Mitchell and Hughes, London, 1896 There also are tombs of the Torres mentioned under Snydale.\\" The Mallets and the Levetts had lived in Normanton for centuries.

Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as tulkus (reincarnated teachers). Tibetan Buddhists believe lamas and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These tulkus are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as living Buddhas. In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, based on the prior Religion Work for Some Questions„Ää‰∏≠ÂÖ±‰∏≠Â§Æ„ÄÅÂõΩÂä°Èô¢ÂÖ≥‰∫éËøõ‰∏ÄÊ≠•ÂÅöÂ•ΩÂÆóÊïôÂ∑•‰ΩúËã•Âπ≤ÈóÆÈ¢òÁöÑÈÄöÁü•„Äãpublished in 1991http://xgcs.org/content/?132.html, that reincarnated lamas must be approved by the Central Government.  Decree  On August 3, 2007, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are \\"illegal or invalid\\". The decree states, \\"It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country.\\" It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be \\"legally- registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha.\\" Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council.  Regulation  The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law. The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, \\"The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs\\".  Impact  The official Xinhua News Agency said the new rules are \\"an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas\\". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power. The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas \\"against religious ritual and historical convention\\", according to the Chinese government. The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 Panchen Lama, whose influence in Gelug Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama. Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991.  Historical precedents  The Golden Urn was established by the Qing Qianlong Emperor to allow the Qing dynasty Emperor of China to determine the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in Yonghe Temple in Beijing for choosing Mongolian Jebtsundamba Khutughtu reincarnations.Foster 2008, pg. 171 The 7th Panchen Lama, Palden Tenpai Nyima, used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso. In 1936, Golden Urn was also institutionalized in the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas„ÄäÂñáÂòõËΩâ‰∏ñËæ¶Ê≥ïhttps://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%96%87%E5%98%9B%E8%BD%89%E4%B8%96%E8%BE%A6%E6%B3%95„Äã by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government. Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name Qoigyijabu (Gyancain Norbu) as the 11th Panchen Lama. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the Government of Tibet in Exile. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso had named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama.Goldstein 1997, pp. 102-9 The Khalkha Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols. The 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai, to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in Lhasa (who had selected a boy from Xikang) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. Guan Jiyu, the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, joined Kuomintang Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at Kumbum Monastery. The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen.Melvyn C. Goldstein, in McKay 2003, p. 222 The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be \\"liberated\\" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic. In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the 17-Point Agreement and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement.\\"The Tenth Panchen Lama\\" He was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama when they met in 1952. The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day Garz√™ Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as \\"the real 6th Dalai Lama\\" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama.Mullin 2001, pp. 276-82 He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen.Seventh Dalai Lama Kelsang Gyatso His reign started when he was 12.

The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia Law School and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that the plan would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less -- almost 90% of all current filers -- would not have to pay income taxes or file tax returns. The Competitive Tax Plan would provide a new payroll tax offset to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate \\"would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors\\". In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015.  About plan author  Michael J. Graetz is professor at Columbia Alumni of Tax Law. He was born at November 20, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is married and has five children. He is also a leading expert on national and international tax law. He has taught at University of Virginia Law School, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and Yale Law School, and also worked as assistant to the secretary and special counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Graetz won the Daniel M. Holland Medal by the National Tax Association. He has written more than 80 articles on a wide range of tax, international taxation, health policy, and social insurance issues.  The \\"Competitive Tax Plan\\" updated for 2015  In his work we can see that in comparison to OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development), he call the U.S. as a \\"Low Tax Country\\" , meant as the total federal, state and local tax revenues as a percentage of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) are much lower than the one of OECD. What can be interesting is that the Income Tax in the U.S. in comparison to EU27 and OECD is equal or even higher. The U.S. has according to Graetz's data from 2010 low consumption tax as a percentage of total taxation. Further he mentions that the U.S. has been the only OECD country without a VAT in comparison to more than 160 countries all over the world that has already have a VAT. This needs to change according to his work. So he came with the so-called \\" the five pieces of competitive tax plan\\" The steps are: * \\"First, enact a VAT, a broad-based tax on sales of goods and services, now used by more than 160 countries worldwide. Many English-speaking countries call this a goods and services tax (GST).\\" * \\"Second, use the revenue produced by this consumption tax to finance an income tax exemption of $100,000 of family income‚Äîfreeing more than 120 million American families from income taxation‚Äîand lower the income tax rates on income above that amount.\\" * \\"Third, lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent.\\" * \\"Fourth, protect low-and-moderate-income workers from a tax increase through payroll tax cuts.\\" * \\"Fifth, protect low-and-moderate income families from a tax increase by substantially expanded refundable tax credits for children, delivered through debit cards to be used at the cash register.\\" There are some basic principles in the proposal for the goods and service tax: * Broad-base, Single Rate, Credit-Method * \\"Models are modern VATs like New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and South Africa, not the archaic European VATs.\\" * \\"Destination-Based, Border-Adjusted\\" * \\"High-threshold for Registration\\" * \\"Incentive for States to piggy back\\" * \\"Eighteen Month to Two- Year Interval between enactment and implementation for businesses and IRS to gear up\\" Proposed VAT is 12.9%. The next point in the competitive tax plan is to shrink the income tax. He proposed to limit the income tax only to high income earners in order to ensure federal tax progressivity. Another step is to provide a Family Allowance of $100,000 for married couples ($50,000 for singles, $75,000 for heads of households). This step will eliminate great part of income tax return( more than 120 million), and it also will resulted in fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. tax units will be required to file income tax returns. He stated specific levels of income tax rates. For example, for married couples it will be: * 14% for income between $100,000 and $200,000 * 27% for income between $200,000 and $600,000 * 31% for income over $600,000 The next step of the Proposal is to \\"Reduce and Reform the Corporate Income Tax\\". Proposed tax rate is 15 percent. This step should solve the problem with international income taxation as it reverse current law's incentives to locate deductions here and income abroad. It will also repeal the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. It should simplify small businesses taxation. Another part of the plan is to protect low and middle income families in the way that delivering new child credits through debit cards that can be used at the cash register. All children qualify for $1,500 per child( but for married couples with more than $150,000 ($75,000 singles and heads of households), these credits phase-out at a rate of 5%*). For low and moderate income workers it will be even more. Next to protecting low and middle income families, the plan also speaks about protecting low and moderate income workers by providing a Payroll Tax Credit of 15.3 percent for wages up to $10,000 and $1,530 per worker for all workers with earnings between $10,000 and $40,000. This credit eliminates all payroll taxes for workers with $10,000 or less of earnings, also it eliminates at least the employees‚Äô share (half) of payroll taxes for workers with earnings below $20,000. Above $40,000 this credit phases out at a rate of 7.65 percent. No formal bill for the Competitive Tax Plan itself is in Congress; however Senator Ben Cardin's Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many similar features.

CGAS San Diego operates three MH-60T Jayhawk helicopters off the Coast Guard ramp. CGAS San Diego is also adjacent to Sector San Diego which houses two 41-foot Utility Boats, two USCG rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB's), one RB-HS and three RB-S. Being implemented are two Special Purpose Craft-Law Enforcement (SPC-LE), which are USCG vessels used for maritime Law Enforcement. The SPC-LE's have three Mercury Marine engines along with some of the most advanced electronics systems in existence. Also at the station are two USCG Coastal Patrol Boats. The air station is physically separated from the rest of the airfield, such that USCG fixed-wing aircraft must cross a busy, 6-lane city street to reach the runway; street light activation opens the locked gates to the airfield and the air station, and also stops traffic while aircraft are traversing the street. History An HH-3F over CGAS San Diego, 1981. Lindbergh Field opened on October 16, 1934 on the Pacific Highway. The San Diego International Airport East Terminal opened on March 6, 1967, and the West Terminal opened July 11, 1979. A new Commuter Terminal opened July 23, 1996. It is self-contained, full service facility with four gates used by seven commuter airlines to handle 25,000 passengers each day. Construction of the expansion of the West Terminal ended in November, 1997. Almost 14 million passengers travel through Lindbergh Field each year. The 27 passenger and cargo airlines operate more than 500 flights each day from the runways. On December 11, 1935 negotiations between the City of San Diego and the U.S. Government were concluded which provided of tideland for the construction of a Coast Guard Air Station adjacent to Lindbergh Field, the Municipal Airport. This project had the strong support of many people and agencies, and particularly the Harbor Commission and Department of San Diego and the Chamber of Commerce. The area for this station was deeded to the Coast Guard at no cost, after approval by citizens of San Diego, at a municipal election held in April 1935. Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures. In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California. CGAS San Diego, circa 1938. Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly. In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project. In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost- effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies.

He was born in Budapest, capital of Hungary. He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973. Early life His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madar√°sz. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation. Tennis career In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934. Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won. In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938. From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses. Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punƒçec and John Bromwich. In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A¬£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame. Playing style He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy. Personal life Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely \\"Lovely as Spring\\" and \\"What Did You Dream Last Night?\\". He also starred in the 1938 musical Happy Landing and the 1941 war comedy Caught in the Draft, although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California.

It was also known as the Longparish Branch and by the nickname of Nile Valley Railway. The passenger services was withdrawn on 6 July 1931. The line was then used for freight only between Hurstbourne to Longparish until 1934 and Longparish to Fullerton Junction until 28 May 1956.  Origins of the nickname  Nile Valley Railway was a nickname given to this line. It is believed the Victorians named it because of the anglers who visited the area to fish the River Test which has a reputation of being one of the finest trout rivers in the UK. Remains of Fullerton Junction  Operators  * London and South Western Railway 1885-1923 * Southern Railway 1923-1948 * British Railways 1948-1956  History  This railway branch was completed as a double-track line in 1885. It was built by the London and South Western Railway in response to the planned Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway. The DN&SR;, with the support of the L&SWR;'s rival the Great Western Railway, planned to build a main line route from the Midlands to Southampton in the heart of the L&SWR;'s territory, with its own terminus and an entirely separate line. The L&SWR; was well aware that the DN&SR;, like most start-up railway companies, was short of finances. It built 7.5-mile (12 km) Fullerton to Hurstbourne line to provide a complete line between Hurstbourne and Romsey. The L&SWR; would offer the DN&SR; the much cheaper alternative of building its line from Newbury to Hurstbourne, where its trains would then run on the new route along L&SWR; track to the Southampton Terminus. The DN&SR; would get its route to Southampton whilst the L&SWR; would be able to exercise control over its competitor. Since the Fullerton to Hurstbourne Line was intended to handle heavy freight and express passenger traffic from the Midlands via the DN&SR; it was built with double tracks and large stations at Longparish and Wherwell complete with extensive goods yards. Despite the line's short length it included some substantial engineering, including a 50-foot (15.2m) deep cutting near Longparish. In the event the DN&SR; rejected the L&SWR;'s proposal and pushed on with its own independent route. Ironically construction of the line stalled for lack of funds at Winchester, but from there it was impossible to link with the Fullerton to Hurstbourne Line. The L&SWR; opened the Fullerton to Hurstbourne Line under its own operation on 1 July 1885 with three passenger trains a day operated by a locomotive and a single carriage shuttling between Fullerton and Whitchurch (the DN&SR; had its own station at the latter village). By the 1890s the service had increased to 5 trains a day but the line remained lightly used. An attempt to reduce costs was made by introducing railmotors on the line in 1910. The line did serve a useful role as a diversionary route between Eastleigh and Southampton for special trains or during engineering works on the main line. Queen Victoria, attracted by the scenery surrounding the line, had the Royal Train sent down the line on several occasions when travelling between Windsor Castle and Osbourne House. It is rumoured that she preferred this route on the way to and from Osborne House because it did not involve passing through any tunnels. By 1913 it was realised that the substantial investment put into building a line to main line standards would never be repaid on the light local traffic. The line was then reduced to a single-track line on 13 July 1913. A saw mill near Longparish station employed more than 100 men between 1914 and 1919 and up to 30 wagons a day carried goods from the mill. The passenger services was withdrawn on 6 July 1931. During the Second World War, an ammunition storage depot was built near Longparish and the line handled a considerable amount of military traffic. The stores remained in place until the early 1950s. The freight service last ran on 28 May 1956, but the track remained and was used to store condemned vans and wagons. The line was taken out of use in April 1960, although a short section at Fullerton remained until 1 June 1964.

Regulation means the employment of legal instruments for the implementation of socio-economic policy objectives, for example the government can establish economic and social regulations in order to realize goals like allocative efficiency, stabilization, or fair and just income distribution In modern economies, the allocation of scarce resources is mainly coordinated by the market. In theory, this allocation of resources is optimal, but these conditions are frequently not complied in practice. The allocation of resources is not optimal and there is need for methods for improving the allocation. One of the methods for achieving efficiency in the allocation of resources is government regulation. According to public interest theory, government regulation is the instrument for overcoming the disadvantages of imperfect competition, unbalanced market operation, missing markets and undesirable market results. Regulation can improve the allocation by facilitating, maintaining, or imitating market operation. The exchange of goods and production factors in markets assumes the definition, allocation and assertion of individual property rights and freedom to contract. Public Interest Theory is a part of welfare economics and emphasizes that regulation should maximize social welfare and that regulation is the result of a cost/benefit analysis done to determine if the cost to improve the operation of the market outweighs the amount of increased social welfare. The following costs can be distinguished in this: 1\\\\. The costs of formulating and implementing regulation; 2\\\\. The costs of maintaining regulation; 3\\\\. The costs of compliance with the rules for industry; 4\\\\. The dead weight costs resulting from distortive changes in connection with 1-3. Public interest theory is developed from classical conceptions of representative democracy and the role of government, and it has considerable confidence in the civil service, according to Max Weber civil servants are office carriers dedicated to carry out the duties that constitute their particular role or task within a strictly ordered and specialized hierarchy. The combination of merit and tenure with unambiguous norms of impartiality support rational decision making based on administrative decision making where individual decisions are attributed to either the subsumption under norms or the balancing of means and ends. In this conception, regulatory administration neither adds to nor subtracts from the policy decided by lawmakers. The public interest may be served, but it is served exactly as interpreted by lawmakers. Bureaucracy does not usurp the public interest, nor does it protect against its usurpation by particularistic interests seeing regulation as a vehicle for their own concerns. Contrary to the capture theory, it states that the ultimate goal of regulation is to pursue some conception of the general good  History  The theory of public interest regulation prevailed up to the 1960s until public choice theory launched its critical attack on established theory. While there is no pointed origin or categorical articulation of this theory, its notions can be traced back to works of Arthur Cecil Pigou;Pigou, A. C. (1932) The Economics of Welfare. London: Macmillan and Co. related to his analysis of externalities and welfare economics. This theory was prevalent, especially during the New Deal progressive era, as stated above, starting the 1960s, economists of the Chicago school began critiquing the assumption of benevolent regulators, proposing counter theories, like the Public choice theory, which is based on personal-interests of agents. Regulation, according to Public interest theory however, is assumed initially to benefit society as a whole rather than particular vested interests.Deegan, C., Unerman, J. (2011) Financial Accounting Theory. Maidenhead: McGraw-Hill Education. The regulatory body is considered to represent the interest of the society in which it operates rather than the private interests of the regulators.Richard A. Posner, Theories of Economic Regulation, The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Autumn, 1974), pp. 335-358  Public Interest Theory in the Practice  One example of the application of Public Interest Theory can be seen in an investigation in Sweden and the energy market: > We test the public interest and regulatory capture hypotheses, in the > context of the Swedish electricity market, by studying the factors > influencing the Swedish Energy Agency‚Äôs decision to replace decision-makers > it employs to hear customer complaints against utilities. > We test if the regulator‚Äôs decision to retain, or replace, the decision- > maker, following a sequence of decisions, can be explained by whether the > customer or utility is being favored by the civil servant. Based on whether > the regulator replaces the decision maker that it has the power to appoint, > we draw inferences about what theory can best explain the behavior of the > regulator. The regulator can choose to favor the customer. To do so would be > consistent with the fact that the primary objective of the electricity > market reform in 1996 was to put the onus on the Swedish Energy Agency to > provide stronger consumer protection against market abuse by the electricity > utilities. On the other hand, the regulator might be captured because the > utilities have more financial and legal resources and they have a well- > established lobby organization which the customers do not have. It is not > clear, therefore, whether customers or utilities have benefited most during > the post-reform regulation.  Criticism and other theories  The most critiqued aspects of Public Interest Theory, are its ambiguity, and inability to determine when and if public interest has progressed. Two problems with public interest theory are: # Different theories arise regarding how much regulation is optimal, and # It is difficult for the legislature to ensure the regulator is acting in the public‚Äôs best interest and not its own When the regulatory agency is established, during a period of regulatory reform, the agency is subject to close scrutiny from the government and the public alike and the regulatory agency faces strong pressure to protect consumers from market abuse. However, over time, the focus of government and public attention turn to other issues, removing the spotlight from the activities of the regulator. With this development, the regulator becomes more susceptible to regulatory capture. The competing hypothesis is that even when a regulatory body is established to protect consumers from monopolistic abuse, it will be captured by the firms that it is established to discipline.

His first match in Divizia A (Romanian First Division) was Olimpia Satu Mare ‚Äì Petrolul Ploie≈üti 3‚Äì0 on 1 August 1998, while playing for Petrolul Ploie≈üti. He was selected once in the Romanian Divisionary National Team (comprising players playing only in the Romanian leagues). Career Born in C√¢mpina, Prahova county, Costescu began playing football with Sterom C√¢mpina in Divizia D (Romanian Fourth Division), and in 1996 he moved to the representative team of the same town, Poiana C√¢mpina, in Divizia B, the Romanian Second Division. He played 2 years for Poiana C√¢mpina, scoring 15 goals in 60 games, helping the team getting a top 10 finish in both seasons. He then attracted the interest of Petrolul Ploie≈üti in Divizia A, the best team from the Prahova county, three-time champions of Romania. At Petrolul Ploie≈üti he established himself as an important striker in the Romanian league, scoring 27 goals between 1999 and 2002. During his time at Petrolul Ploie≈üti he caught the eyes of Romanian greats Steaua Bucure»ôti and Dinamo Bucuresti. After his experience at Petrolul Ploie≈üti, he changed the team but not the city, signing for Astra Ploie≈üti, where he had a prolific season, scoring 10 goals in 26 games, helping them to a record-high 9th position in Divizia A. After his short spell at Astra Ploie≈üti, he returned to Petrolul Ploie≈üti, where he played for another 2 years, scoring 9 goals in 36 games. In 2004, he transferred to a well-established club in Romania, FC Arge≈ü Pite≈üti, 2-time champions of Romania and the team that gave players like Nicolae Dobrin, Adrian Mutu, Adrian Neaga, DƒÉnu≈£ Coman and Paul Codrea. But, unfortunately for him, his time at FC Arge≈ü was not one of the best, managing to score just 2 goals in 1 season. He was transferred in 2006 by Divizia A newcomers Unirea Urziceni, who were in need of an experienced man upfront. Unirea proved to be a surprise-pack, finishing 10th in the league, and Daniel scored 2 goals for his new team. After his season at Unirea he transferred to CeahlƒÉul Piatra Neam≈£.

Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1.Walsh Diamond Responses The convention has its origins in the Walsh SystemThe Walsh System is also known as Western Roth- Stone, West Coast Scientific and Western Scientific. Reference: developed by Richard Walsh. In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand. When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1. Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 - 1; 1NT - 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead. When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 - 1; 1NT - 2\\\\. The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints). It is a form of Canap√© and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 90. Vohidov was returned to his native Tajikistan on 28 February 2007. Imprisoned by the Taliban Vohidov was one of nine former Taliban prisoners the Associated Press pointed out had gone from Taliban custody to American custody. The Taliban had accused Vohidov of spying for Russia, and imprisoned him for nearly three years. At Kandahar Airfield, he complained to Cpt. Danner that he had been housed in a more humane prison by the Taliban, where he had been given a radio, fresh fruit and proper toilet facilities.Begg, Moazzam. Enemy Combatant, 2006. p. 120 Trial in Tajikistan Vohidov and Rukniddin Sharipov were to stand trial in Tajikistan. They were charged with *illegally crossing the Tajik border into Afghanistan in early 2001; *joining fighters of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Vohidov and Sharopov received sentences of 17 years on 18 August 2007. The two men were convicted of serving as mercenaries. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald on 7 July 2009, reported that Umar Abdulayev, the sole remaining Tajikistani, reported that a delegation of Tajikistani security officials threatened to retaliate against him Sharipov and Vohidov, unless they agreed to pretend to be militant jihadists, and report on real militant jihadists, following their repatriations. McClatchy interview On 15 June 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. McClatchy reporters interviewed Airat Vakhitov by telephone. Vohidov told his interviewers he was suffering ongoing mental problems, and that he was worried that if interviewers visited him in person he would be punished by Russian security officials. Vohidov had been an imam in Tatarstan, who was imprisoned following a general round-up when Russian officials were cracking down on Chechens. He was temporarily freed, and fled Russia when he learned that security officials were looking for him. He said he was kidnapped by the forces of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and eventually transported to Afghanistan, against his will. 2012 elections Bridget McCormack, a candidate for a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court, helped defend Vohitov, and in 2012, the Judicial Crisis Network broadcast an advertisement which criticized her for \\"freeing a terrorist.\\" Andrew Rosenthal, of The New York Times criticized the Judicial Crisis Network ad, which contained footage of Teri Johnson, the mother of Joseph Johnson, a GI who was killed in Afghanistan, who says: Rosenthal pointed out that Vohitov was freed through the non-judicial review, through the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants in 2007. Reports Vohidov volunteered in Iraq or Syria In 2016, reports emerged that Vohidov had volunteered to fight in Iraq. John Kerry classes Vohidov a terrorist On 29 June 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry, citing Executive Order 13224, classed Vohidov as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.

The Williams brothers confessed to killing the couple because they were gay. Background=Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder were together as a couple for 14 years. They lived in Happy Valley, California, just outside Redding. Matson, 50, earned a Master of Science degree in environmental horticulture from UC Davis in 1984. Afterwards, he and Mowder founded Matson Horticulture and Florabundance Nursery in Redding. Matson helped found a community garden to help feed the hungry (called the Redding Farmers Market), the Carter House Natural Science Museum (for children), and the Redding Arboretum. He was divorced from his wife, Marcia Howe, who was also responsible for the founding of Carter House Natural Science Museum, which eventually evolved into Turtle Bay Exploration Park, and with whom he had a daughter, Clea. Mowder, 40, held a Bachelor of Science degree in anthropology and worked part-time as an associate in Orchard Supply Hardware's Garden Department, while also attending Chico State University. He frequently spoke at local high schools, serving as a source of knowledge and support for both gay and straight teens. Together in 1997, Matson and Mowder founded Plantstogo.com, an online nursery specializing in plants for hot climates. The Williams brothers The Williams brothers operated a landscaping and lawn service out of their parents' home in Palo Cedro, California. Neighbors said that the family was known for their fundamentalist Christianity, and that recordings of sermons and religious music were often heard from their house. Prior to moving to Redding, the Williams lived in Gridley, California, a farming community in Butte County, California. According to neighbors, the family kept to themselves. The boys were not allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. When the family moved to Redding, on what the father‚ÄîBenjamin Williams‚Äîtold neighbors were \\"God's orders\\"‚Äîmail from militia groups, addressed to the family, continued to arrive at their home. After the move, Matthew Williams briefly served in the Navy, while stationed in Bremerton, Washington. While living in Moscow, Idaho, Matthew joined the Charismatic Christian church, Living Faith Fellowship, and then became fascinated with white supremacist and antisemitic literature he read on the Internet. The murders On the morning of July 1, Oscar Matson called his son, Gary, and heard a newly recorded outgoing answering machine message saying that the couple were both ill and were leaving to visit with a \\"specialist friend\\" of theirs in San Francisco for a week. Police said the man on the recording sounded distressed and seemed to be feigning illness. Detectives said they believed that the man in the recording was trying to send a message that a close acquaintance had forced him to make the recording. Another male voice was heard in the background telling the man in the recording to \\"just calm down.\\" Believing that the male voice did not sound like Matson or Mowder, Roger Matson drove to his brother's home and discovered the bodies. The couple's nude bodies were found in their bed. Shell casings from a .22 caliber gun littered the floor, and the walls and ceiling were stained with blood. There was no sign of forced entry, and no apparent signs of robbery or anything being taken from the house. Matson's Toyota Tercel station wagon was gone, and police recovered it 50 miles south near Yuba City. Investigators said that, after being forced to make the recording, the couple was forced into their platform bed, which stood seven feet off the floor. The killers then stood on chairs at the foot of the bed and fired at the couple. Matson received five shots to the head and one to the back. Mowder was shot seven times in the head and once in the neck. The arrests Matthew and Tyler Williams were arrested after police found Matson's vehicle abandoned at the side of the road near Oroville, California. The brothers were arrested at about 4:30 p.m. on July 7, 1999, as they left a Yuba City shopping mall. Both carried handguns. Matthew wore a bulletproof vest. Police were alerted by a phone call made two hours after Matson and Mowder were killed, to a company in Scottsdale, Arizona.The caller ordered ammunition and other equipment worth $2,276.09, and asked that the order be sent to a Yuba City private mailbox firm, care of Gary Matson. The order was paid for with Matson's credit card. Detectives traced the address and arrived just as the Williams brothers showed up. Searches of the brothers' residences yielded finds of literature from white supremacist organizations, including the World Church of the Creator (now known as the Creativity Movement). The World Church of the Creator was a pantheistic white separatist, anti-Christian religion. Investigators examined whether the case was part of a conspiracy of hate-crime violence by members of the World Church of the Creator. The Matson and Mowder murders took place just days before World Church of the Creator associate Benjamin Nathaniel Smith went on a shooting spree targeting racial and ethnic minorities in Illinois and Indiana. Unnamed federal resources were cited as having found a handwritten letter from Matthew Williams to National Alliance leader William Pierce. In addition, investigators also found .22 caliber shells and 13 lbs. of black powder. Tyler Williams' account After the brothers' arrest, authorities said they believed the brothers were acquainted with Matson and Mowder through their involvement in the local landscaping industry. In a pre- sentencing interview with Shasta County deputy probation officer Gerald Salles, Tyler Williams recounted how he and his brother planned and carried out the murders. Tyler Williams said he and his brother first talked about killing Matson and Mowder two weeks before the July 1, 1999 shootings, after Matthew Williams told Tyler that he'd met Matson and Mowder at the Redding Farmers Market. The couple, like Matthew Williams, had a booth. Ed Smith, who owned a Palo Cedro nursery where Matthew Williams worked for six months, also said Matthew Williams knew Matson and described them as friends. Tyler Williams said he did not know how his brother decided to single out the couple, but that Matthew told him they were a homosexual couple. Olin Gordon, of Olinda‚Äîwho had considered hiring the Williams brothers to do some landscaping‚Äîsaid that Matthew Williams had mentioned knowing Matson was homosexual. According to Tyler, the brothers drove out to Happy Valley late on the night of June 30 or early on July 1, in a Toyota Corolla registered to their father. Matson and Mowder were asleep in their bed. He then said that Matthew Williams did the shooting, emptying a magazine from his .22 calibre semiautomatic handgun before reloading and firing five more shots. Other than labored breathing, Tyler Williams said the victims made no sound before or after the shootings. After the shooting, Matthew Williams drove away in Matson's Toyota Tercel while Tyler Williams returned to his parents' house and went to sleep. Tyler Williams' account did not include an explanation for the newly recorded outgoing message on the answering machine, which investigators believed the couple had been forced to make, suggesting that they were awake at time of the shooting, and not asleep as Tyler Williams claimed. Motive In his account of the murders, Tyler Williams said that his brother did not consider the killing of Matson and Mowder to be murder, but a \\"judgment\\" instead. In November 1999 Matthew Williams began giving interviews to various media outlets. In an interview with The Sacramento Bee, he admitted to the murders and said that when he killed Matson and Mowder he was \\"obeying the law of God.\\" Williams said that he committed the murders because he believed their homosexuality violated God's laws, and he hoped his actions would incite more killings. Williams insisted that his actions did not constitute murder and claimed that he expected to receive a fairly light sentence even if found guilty, ignoring the fact that he was on trial for first-degree murder and would face either the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole under California law if convicted. Because the Bible holds that homosexuality is a sin that must be punished by death, he claimed, the responsibility lies with the victims. Williams expressed regret that more \\"people who claim to be Christians\\" didn't \\"have the guts\\" to act as he had. Admitting the possibility of his future execution, he said he hoped to become a \\"Christian martyr\\" whose death would inspire others to lash out against Jews, homosexuals, and other minorities. Matthew Williams' sexuality questioned In interviews with media, two friends from Matthew Williams' past recounted incidents concerning questions about his sexual orientation. Todd Bethel served in the Navy with Williams, and claimed to have been his best friend during that period. He briefly rented an apartment with Williams when they were both assigned to a ship in Bremerton, Washington. Bethel, who reportedly tried to sell a videotape and photographs of Williams, said that he and others thought Williams acted too \\"prissy\\" and \\"sat too close to other men.\\" Bethel asked Williams if he was gay, and said Williams denied it but seemed disturbed by the idea that he might be perceived as such. In August 1999 Dan Martin, Williams' best friend from his time in the Living Faith Fellowship, gave an interview to The Advocate, which described their relationship as a romantic friendship. According to Martin, the two shared poetry, skinny-dipped, and traded stories over campfires in the Idaho mountains. When Williams left the church to drift into the white supremacist movement, Martin went on to become a gay rights activist. According to Martin, shortly before the murders Williams called a mutual friend looking for Martin's home number in Moscow, Idaho. When he was told that Martin identified as openly gay and was coordinator of an HIV prevention group, Williams began to sob uncontrollably. Martin said he thought the revelation may have triggered the murders of Matson and Mowder. Aftermath=Synagogue and clinic arsons During searches of the brothers' homes and storage utilities, authorities also found a \\"hit list\\" of prominent Jewish civic leaders in the Sacramento, California area. The list was apparently compiled after the June 18, 1999 arson attacks against three synagogues in Sacramento -- Congregation B'nai Israel, Congregation Beth Shalom, and Knesset Israel Torah Center. The fires caused over $1 million in damage. On March 17, the brothers were charged with setting the three synagogue fires and the July 2 fire at Country Club Medical Center, which housed an abortion clinic. The charges carried of up to 235 years in prison. Matthew Williams later admitted to reporters that he was one of eight or nine men who set fire to the synagogues and the clinic. He also claimed that his brother Tyler had not been involved. Arson pleas In September 2001, the brothers pleaded guilty to their 1999 arson attacks against synagogues and clinics. In December 2001, the brothers were sentenced for the arsons‚ÄîMatthew Williams to 30 years, and Tyler Williams to 21 years, and were ordered to pay more than $1 million in restitution. Congratulations to Reverend Williams In June 2000, Matthew Williams' court-appointed attorney paid for an advertisement that appeared in the June 18 edition of The Redding Record Searchlight, congratulating Williams on being ordained as a minister by the Christ's Covenant Church. The two-column-by- four-inch advertisement depicted a dove bearing an olive branch, and was labeled as having been placed by \\"the family and friends of Benjamin Matthew Williams.\\" The ad, which appeared on Father's Day, read \\"Rev. Williams: May your knowledge and faith continue to grow during your current persecutions and trials.\\" William's attorney, Frank J. O'Connor, placed the ad and paid the $107.70 bill to The Redding Record Searchlight. O'Connor and the Williams family refused to comment on the ad. The newspaper said that the advertising representative did not focus on Williams' name when the order was placed, and that the ad would not have been printed had the paper been aware of its content. Matthew Williams' suicide On June 22, 2002, Matthew Williams and another inmate attacked prison guard Timothy Renault with a homemade hatchet. Renault suffered a skull fracture and a broken jaw. Matthew Williams was kept in a segregation unit following the attack. At 6:30 a.m. on November 17, 2002, Matthew Williams was found dead in his cell, an apparent suicide. It is believed that he killed himself sometime late the previous night, November 16, or early in the morning on the 17th. Williams jammed his cell door with a piece of cardboard, and then spread a blanket between his cell toilet and the wall, so that he would not be seen by his jailers. He bled to death from multiple self-inflicted slash wounds to his arms, legs, and neck from a disposable jail-issue razor he had modified to expose the blade, attached to a handle fashioned from a ballpoint pen, and fastened to his wrist with dental floss. Around his neck he wore an amulet fashioned from dental floss and aluminum foil, containing various items, including two Bible verses. Officials did not say which Bible verses the amulet held, but in Williams' cell a Bible was open to Psalms 22 and 23. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 2. After Matthew Williams' suicide, it was reported that the Shasta County jail had been ordered by the court to make sure that Williams had no narcotics in his system, so he could be drug-free for a brain scan his attorneys had arranged. Williams was to be weaned off his medications, but Shasta County jail staff stopped Williams' medication abruptly. Two days prior to committing suicide, Matthew Williams mailed a signed confession to his brother's attorney, taking full responsibility for the murders of Matson and Mowder. In the one-page letter, Williams wrote that it was an \\"accepted fact\\" that he killed Matson and Mowder, whom he referred to as \\"the 2 perverts.\\" He expressed concern about poisoning a jury against his brother, whose innocence he maintained. Tyler Williams' attorney turned the letter over the court for review on the case. While he later attempted to use this document to dismiss the charges against his client, the court rejected this approach, stating that the \\"confession\\" had no legal value and that they would neither dismiss any charges against Tyler nor consider any leniency in a plea bargain as a result of it. Sentence In March 2003 Tyler Williams pleaded guilty to the murders of Matson and Mowder.

He struggled to establish himself at Ewood Park and was loaned to a number of clubs before being released at the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season. A highlight of his loan spells was when he scored the winning goal for Sheffield United against Preston North End, helping them win 3-2 when they had at one stage trailed 2-0. Another loan spell at Bristol Rovers yielded one goal against Rochdale. He scored three goals during his time at Blackburn; once in the league against Bolton Wanderers and twice in a League Cup tie against Portsmouth. In May 2002 he joined Swansea City and quickly established himself in the first team.

It is found in Magdalena, Orinoco, Amazon, Paraguay-Paran√°, and S√£o Francisco Rivers. It is also the only aspredinid genus found west of the Andes, found in the Atrato, San Juan, and Pat√≠a Rivers. This genus is a part of the family Aspredinidae, known as banjo catfishes for their large, flattened heads and slender tails that give the appearance of a banjo. Most species exhibit cryptic coloration, and the same holds true among Bunocephalus species. The skin is completely keratinized and is covered by large, unculiferous tubercles. Bunocephalus species may reach up to 13 centimetres SL. Species There are currently 12 recognized species in this genus: * Bunocephalus aleuropsis Cope, 1870 * Bunocephalus amaurus C. H. Eigenmann, 1912 (Camouflaged catfish) * Bunocephalus chamaizelus C. H. Eigenmann, 1912 * Bunocephalus colombianus C. H.

Cardoso, Friel & R. E. dos Reis, 2015 * Bunocephalus verrucosus (Walbaum, 1792) (Gnarled catfish) The removal of Pseudobunocephalus from Bunocephalus was an attempt to make it monophyletic. Even in this reduced state, Bunocephalus is still the largest genus in the Aspredinidae. In the aquarium B. coracoideus is the most common species of banjo catfish found in the aquarium fishkeeping hobby. These fish are nocturnal. This species is peaceful and a good idea for a community aquarium. These fish may be kept with sand to allow them to bury themselves or with a flat rock to hide underneath. Reproduction has been accomplished in the home aquarium. These fish can be easily sexed because females are much fatter and fuller than males. The mating pair should be conditioned on live foods for at least a month. Spawning is induced by a larger water change; the pair will spawn within two days. Spawning occurs at night. Some sources say they spawn under a fallen leaf or on a large rock, incubating their eggs by sitting on them, while others list them as egg-scatterers.

It was an UFO investigation group, famed for its investigation of the black triangle incidents in Belgium, known as the Belgian Wave, in 1989 and 1990. The society was formed in 1971 and had 700 registered members before the end of the year. It was hosted in a small office room owned by its general secretary, Lucien Clerebaut, and its main activity was the publication of a magazine, Inforespace, in 1972. Membership rose to 1750 in 1976, and Clerebaut purchased a building in Anderlecht for the society the same year. However, its popularity then started to decline, with a drop in membership down to 500 members in 1985; Inforespace went from a publication rate of six per year down to only two per year. But in November 1989, a wave of UFO sightings struck Belgium, bringing the SOBEPS into the mediatic spotlight. It received hundreds of testimonies and collaborated with the Belgian Air Force on a fruitless UFO hunt in April 1990. Due to financial difficulties, the SOBEPS dissolved on 31 December 2007, and the COBEPS (Comit√© Belge pour l‚Äô√âtude des Ph√©nom√®nes Spatiaux or Belgian Committee for the Study of Space Phenomena) was formed to continue some of the SOBEPS's activities.

A \\"pioneer in the risky business of war reportage\\", his torture and death during the Second Opium War was a factor in the British and French decision to raze the Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) in Beijing. Early life Born in Gibraltar, he was the son of Thomas Bowlby, a Captain in the Royal Artillery, and Williamina Martha Arnold Balfour, daughter of Major-General William Balfour, a former Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. Bowlby's parents moved while he was young to Sunderland, where his father became a timber merchant. Bowlby was educated by Dr Cowan, a Scottish school teacher living in Sunderland. After finishing his schooling he trained as a solicitor under his cousin Russell Bowlby of Sunderland and on completion of his training he moved to London where spent some years as a salaried clerk to a law firm in The Temple. In 1846 he became junior partner to the firm of Lawrence, Crowdy and Bowlby. However, Bowlby found the law uncongenial and felt drawn to a career in writing. Career Although he remained as a member of the firm of Lawrence, Crowdy and Bowlby until 1854, Bowlby went to Berlin as a special correspondent for The Times in 1848 to report on the revolutions occurring in Europe at the time. In 1860, Bowlby was engaged to travel to China as the special correspondent of The Times to cover the Second Opium War, which was fought by the Chinese Qing Empire against the British and French. Lord Elgin and Baron Gros were his fellow passengers on the steamship SS Malabar, which sank in Galle harbour on 22May 1860 after being beached in a severe storm. Bowlby's report of the shipwreck was considered one of his best pieces of work. Bowlby's reports from China were informative and popular with readers of The Times. Whilst focusing on political and military developments, he also described many elements of local culture, such as gardening.  Imprisonment and death  After the capture of Tientsin (Tianjin) on 23August 1860, Bowlby accompanied the British envoys Henry Loch and Harry Smith Parkes and their escorts to Tungchow (present-day Tongzhou District, Beijing) to arrange a peace treaty with the Qing Empire. However, when the negotiations broke down, the Qing general Sengge Rinchen arrested Bowlby and the delegation. Bowlby and the other captives were held at Tungchow and tortured, sometimes to death, over several days. Constricting ligatures were applied to their bodies; as they dried, they tightened. Those who cried out for water had dirt poured into their mouths. Bowlby died on 22September. In retaliation for the treatment of the delegation, the British and French burnt down the Qing Empire's Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) in Beijing. Lord Elgin reportedly told a French commander \\"What would The Times say of me, if I did not avenge its correspondent?\\" Bowlby's mangled body was retrieved later and buried in the Russian cemetery outside the Anding Gate of Beijing on 17October 1860. He was survived by his widow and five young children, among whom included the surgeon Sir Anthony Alfred Bowlby.

The operation was a follow-up operation of Operation Anaconda and was meant to kill or capture the remaining Al-Qaida and Taliban rebels. The operation has been called a \\"mopping up\\" operation after Operation Anaconda. The operation is named after an African bird type, jacana, described in one manual as \\"shy, retiring, easily overlooked\\". Operation Jacana includes the following operations: *Operation Ptarmigan *Operation Snipe *Operation Condor *Operation Buzzard All these operations were meant to \\"clean up\\" the remaining Al-Qaida and Taliban forces out of the area of operations. Events=Operation Ptarmigan On 16 April 2002, a Royal Marine taskforce had been deployed to Bagram Airbase as part of Operation Ptarmigan: A 5-day operation with the aim is to clear high mountain valleys (up to 11,000 ft, south east of Gardez, searching for Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces and to destroy their bunkers and cave complexes. The Operation took place in coordination with Coalition forces conducting Operation Mountain lion (whose objectives were the same) that began a day earlier. 400 troops from the Royal Marines reconnaissance troop supported by the RAF, discovered a number of previously unknown cave complexes, one of which contained over 20,000 rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition in the Shah-i-Kot area, which was destroyed.Clements, Frank A., Conflict in Afghanistan: An Encyclopedia (Roots of Modern Conflict), ABC-CLIO, 2003 More than 400 Royal Marines went into \\"action\\" alongside a small number of US and Afghan troops, after the US requested help, they did not encounter Taleban or al-Qaeda- supporting suspicions that many have fled across the nearby border to Pakistan- but there was evidence and indications that the facilities had been used and a coalition troops seized a \\"great deal\\" of papers, maps and radios in Shah-i-Kot area which was studied for intelligence information. The operation ended on April 18 2002.Clements, Frank A., Conflict in Afghanistan: An Encyclopedia (Roots of Modern Conflict), ABC-CLIO, 2003 By 20 April 2002, a total of nearly 1,700 Royal Marines had been deployed as part of the task force. Operation Snipe May 10, 2002. Operation Snipe; this was reportedly the largest explosion by Royal Engineers since World War II In May 2002, 600 Royal Marines and 400 Afghan soldiers supported by U.S. air power and U.S. special operations troops began Operation Snipe, a continuation of Operation Ptarmigan in Patika Province. The Royal Marine force carrying out the operation did not come across any al Qaeda or Taliban fighters (whilst moving into position the marines found a small-arms ammunition hidden in a cave and some old defensive positions belonging to al-Qaeda), however on 9 May, the troops discovered caves and removed 30 truckloads of anti-aircraft, anti-tank ammunition and other heavy munitions and military equipment, including mortars, 2 Russian- made tanks were also found outside the cave. On 10 May, British troops destroyed \\"a vast arsenal of weaponry\\" (more than 20 truckloads of ammunition and weapons were destroyed in the biggest controlled explosion British forces have carried out since World War II) and al Qaeda or Taliban infrastructure by blowing up an enormous cache of weapons stored in a cave complex. The operation lasted 2 weeks (other sources say 16 days) and ended on 13 May 2002, the operation was part of a much larger operation led by the 101st Airborne Division and designed to show the al-Qa'eda and Taliban fighters, the vast majority of whom were known to be in sanctuaries inside Pakistan, that they could not operate inside Afghanistan with impunity. One reason for the failure of not finding any al-Qaeda or Taliban militants was the refusal by Major- General Franklin Hagenbeck, the US force commander, of several British requests for a blocking force of American troops from 101st Airborne Division to plug two valleys as the Marines moved through them. Operation Condor On 17 May 2002, coalition forces began Operation Condor following after an incident in Patika province the previous day: On May 16, an Australian SAS patrol and came under fire for five hours from heavy mortars and machine guns and were chased by 20 or 60 suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban militants, Apache helicopter gunships and AC-130 gunship carried out airstrikes killing about 10 people, the rest of fighters are thought to have dispersed into small groups and blended in with local residents or fled across the border to neighbouring Pakistan; the next day, and other coalition forces had been deployed to assist them where a 1,000-strong coalition force (500-800 were Royal Marines) led by the Royal Marines surrounded the Khost-Paktia region, American, British and Australian forces were in \\"blocking\\" positions as the British Royal Marines swept the area, supported by US attack helicopters and gunships who bombarded the area; the operation was conducted at heights of between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. On 17 May Brigadier Roger Lane, the top British commander in the coalition forces were battling a \\"substantial force\\" of suspected al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in the mountains, but British Royal Marines spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Ben Curry said on 18 May: \\"There has been no combat, we have established a forward operating base and are now clearing the area,\\" Coalition jets and helicopters supported ground troops throughout the day. Coalition troops searched the area without meeting any resistance, but a small amount of ammunition including two 120 mm rockets On 20 May, Brigadier Roger Lane, the commander of the Royal Marine force in Afghanistan was replaced by Brigadier Jim Dutton, relations between Lane and the head of the US military were said to be poor after US General Tommy Franks allegedly found out about the Royal Marines' Operation from CNN rather than from Brig Lane. He also contradicted the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, by saying the war in Afghanistan would be over in a few weeks. Mr Rumsfeld publicly disagreed; he lost the confidence of his men, his junior commanders and his tactical decisions look increasingly \\"desperate for some success\\". Operation Buzzard On 28 or 29 May 2002, the Royal Marines began Operation Buzzard: the aim of the operation was to \\"prevent freedom of movement of al-Qa'eda and Taliban and to deny them sanctuary from which to operate\\" according to Royal Marine Lieutenant-Colonel Ben Curry. 45 to 300 British Marines from Taskforce Jacana and local Afghan soldiers were deployed into Khost close to Afghan- Pakistan border, accompanied by several US civil affairs officials on a \\"hearts and minds\\" operation; amid fears that al-Qaeda and Taliban forces were plotting terrorist attacks from across the frontier. The Marines conducted patrols in populated and rural areas using a mixture of helicopter, foot and vehicle patrols and setting up checkpoints; this new method was to be \\"unpredictable, operating in smaller sub-unit attachments operating in an area sometimes covertly and introducing that unpredictability and doubt into the minds of the al-Qaeda and Taliban.\\"Clements, Frank A., Conflict in Afghanistan: An Encyclopedia (Roots of Modern Conflict), ABC-CLIO, 2003 Caves and bunkers containing arms, ammunition and supplies were found and destroyed. Over 100 mortars, a hundred anti-tank weapons along with hundreds of RPGs, anti-personnel mines, rockets and artillery shells and thousands of rounds of small-arms and anti-aircraft ammunition. Two British marines confronted nine armed rebels and made them surrender. The operation came to an end on 9 July 2002, the operation had shown that al-Qaeda and the Taliban had abandoned a large scale presence in the region.Clements, Frank A., Conflict in Afghanistan: An Encyclopedia (Roots of Modern Conflict), ABC-CLIO, 2003 A Norwegian Soldier on patrol in Afghanistan - their expertise in altitude and climate became indispensable 45 Commando had been chosen for this operation due to their expertise in high-altitude warfare, for which they train regularly in the Norwegian mountains; despite this experience, altitude sickness still became a problem with some of the marines, who needed to be airlifted out due to this condition. Norwegian special forces were also specifically asked by NATO to operate in these highland areas because of their experience in high altitudes and cold weather.

Influence in architecture and the arts Egyptian architecture and the low-perspective, hieratic styles of Egyptian art have undergone several revivals in the Western world. Various obelisks have been carried off as trophies by colonial powers, or bestowed as gifts by Egyptian leaders, and these stand in a number of locations far from Egypt. The \\"Cleopatra's Needles\\" that stand in London, Paris, and New York City are examples of these transported obelisks. Egyptian architectural motifs appear in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,Francesco Colonna, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: The Strife of Love in a Dream (Joscelyn Godwin, translator). (London & New York: Thames & Hudson, 1999 and re-editions) and Athanasius Kircher's Oedipus Aegyptiacus contains a fanciful attempt to translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. Egyptian themes became much more widespread, however, after Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics, enabling Egyptian works to be read. The nineteenth century proved to be a heyday for Egyptianizing themes in art, architecture, and culture; these persisted into the early 20th century, and were revived briefly after the discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamen. Various mystical and fraternal groups incorporated Egyptian themes.Joscelyn Godwin, Christian Chanel, and John Patrick Deveney, The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Historical and Initiatic Documents of an Order of Practical Occultism (York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1995) The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn had an \\"Isis-Urania\\" lodge in London, and an Ahathoor lodge in Paris.Greer, Mary K. Women of the Golden Dawn. (Park Street, 1994) . The Shriners incorporated both Islamic and Egyptian themes into their visual imagery, including their characteristic fezzes. The Murat Shrine Temple in Indianapolis, Indiana contains a celebrated Egyptian Room, decorated with hieroglyphic motifs and Egyptian themed murals.Murat Shrine Temple history (official site), accessed Aug. 6, 2007 The Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) opened a Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in 1928. In literature, Rick Riordan has written three books based on Egyptian mythology in the modern world: The Kane Chronicles - The Red Pyramid, The Throne of Fire, and The Serpent's Shadow. These books are about the adventures of two siblings, Sadie and Carter Kane, who discover that the ancient Egyptian world is still amongst them and they discover that they have the blood of pharaohs and must learn to become magicians in the House of Life. In their adventures they meet and interact with several ancient Egyptian Gods. In The Age of Ra by James Lovegrove, humanity is ruled by the Egyptian pantheon. The Egyptian gods have taken over the world by defeating all other Pantheons that once existed. They have since carved the world into different realms named after themselves.

The naming could also be due in part to the fact that in later Egyptian myths, Set basically replaced Apep in most every sense and aspect. * In Rick Riordan's The Red Pyramid, The Throne of Fire and The Serpent's Shadow of the series The Kane Chronicles, Apophis is locked away in battle with Bast before the first book but is released. He is revealed as the villain at the end of the first book, and is the main antagonist of the series before being destroyed at the end of The Serpent's Shadow when his shadow is trapped and destroyed by the Kanes after he swallows Ra. * There is a card in the Yu-Gi- Oh!

Here, Sutekh is the last of a powerful alien race called the Osirians and has power over robotic mummies and an archeologist called Marcus Scarman. He needs to destroy the Eye of Horus, a force that keeps him trapped. * In the animated series Mummies Alive!, Set is a dog like minor villain. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. * Neopets features a Petpet called Seti that looks similar to Set. * In The Kane Chronicles, Set is the main antagonist in the first book The Red Pyramid, but a minor anti-hero of sorts in The Throne of Fire and The Serpent's Shadow. Sobek * The statue on the island in the American TV show Lost is of Sobek. * The American death metal band Nile refer to Sobek/Sebek in several songs, the most obvious being \\"Sacrifice Unto Sebek\\" from their 2005 album Annihilation of the Wicked. * In the Egyptian-themed first person shooter game PowerSlave, there is a mystical artifact called the \\"Sobek Mask\\", which allows the bearer to breathe underwater. * A fictional supervillain published by DC Comics first appearing in 52 #26 (2006). * In the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game there is a card called \\"Sebek's Blessing\\" which is based upon Sobek. * In the online video game League of Legends, a champion named Renekton is based on the god Sobek. * In season 5 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode 8 Shadow, an artefact purchased by the character Glory is referenced as belonging to the cult of Sobek, who is referred to as a general 'god of reptiles' rather than just crocodiles. It is used as part of a transmogrification spell to turn a cobra into a giant snake monster capable of hunting The Key. * In the British television series Primeval, in which a team investigate time portals that lead to prehistoric eras, it is implied that Sobek was in fact a Pristichampsus worshipped by the Egyptians. * He appears in The Kane Chronicles as an antagonist in The Red Pyramid, working for Set. He attacks Carter and Sadie Kane as well as their protector Bast at the Rio Grande and tries to kill them. Bast ends up sacrificing herself to banish Sobek back to his realm, the Duat. After Set's defeat, he supports Horus and returns in The Serpent's Shadow as a guard on Ra's nightly journey. When Ra is reborn, he announces it and battles Apophis with Ra, Bes and Bast. He isn't seen again and leaves the Earth with the other gods. In the Son of Sobek, a petsuchos, referred to as a \\"son of Sobek\\" fights Percy Jackson and Carter Kane and is defeated. Carter initially thinks the monster might be Sobek himself when he sees it is a crocodile and is annoyed as Sobek had promised to behave since they are on Ra's good side. * In the online video game SMITE, Sobek appears as a playable character as a Guardian of the Egyptian Pantheon. * In the videogame Assassin's Creed: Origins, Ubisoft published a new challenge where Bayek, the main character, face Sobek.

In The Serpent's Shadow, he aids the Kanes in figuring out how to kill Apophis, but won't help them too much directly as it is forbidden. * In the PSP game Kamigami no Asobi: Ludere Deorum (translated as Mischief of the Gods), Thoth is one of the 8 main characters in the game where the player will take on the role of the heroine and choose one of the male characters as her love interest. An anime television series adaption of the game was aired in April 2014. * In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Boingo's Stand Thoth takes the form of a divinatory comic book. * In the online video game SMITE, there is an item called Book of Thoth which is a direct reference to Thoth, and also appears as a playable character as a Mage of the Egyptian Pantheon.  General Pantheon  In the Palladium Fantasy and Rifts role-playing games, both from Palladium Books, the Church of Light and Dark is based on the Ancient Egyptian pantheon, with Ra, Thoth, and Isis being chief among the gods of light and Set, Anubis, and Apepi being the chief gods of darkness. In Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods, history is re- imagined so mythological gods of Europe, Africa, and Asia were brought to the New World as ideas who manifest in physical form, and are waging a war against new gods. Mr. Ibis (Thoth) and Mr. Jacquel (Anubis) own a funeral parlor together in Cairo, Illinois, with their cat Bast (Bastet) and Horus. Aside from the aforementioned, the third arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has four other Stands named after gods from the Ancient Egyptian pantheon: Atum (belonging to Telence T. D'Arby), Horus (belonging to Pet Shop), Khnum (belonging to Oingo) and Osiris (belonging to Daniel J. D'Arby). Of note, all of their users are antagonists of the arc. The Mummy * The title character in the 1932 Universal horror film The Mummy is the reanimated Prince Imhotep, who uses the alias Ardeth Bay (an anagram of 'Death by Ra') who was renamed Mehemet Bey in later adaptations of The Mummy, but as a separate character from the monster himself. * The 1999 version of The Mummy, its sequel The Mummy Returns, and the spinoff film The Scorpion King delve deeper into the mystical aspects of Egyptian mythology than the original version did. Also, a \\"Medjai\\" named Ardeth Bay, a reference to the original movie's alias for the reanimated Imhotep, helps the O'Connors fight the Mummy. * In League of Legends, a champion named Amumu is also based on The Mummy.

Storz was regarded as a \\"giant in the brewing world\\".Schmittroth, L and Rostek, M.K. (1994) Cities of the United States: A Compilation of Current Information on Economies.

NEGenWeb Project - Douglas County. Retrieved August 8, 2007. After arriving in Omaha, Storz worked at Joseph Baumann's brewery. In 1876, Bauman died. Storz was renamed the foreman under Baumann's widow, then rented the brewery from her to run it himself. In 1891 Storz founded the Omaha Brewing Association, with himself as president. After purchasing the company, in 1892 Storz built a state-of-the-art facility at 1819 North 16th Street in North Omaha, located at the intersection of Sherman Avenue (North 16th Street) and Clark Street.Storz Brewery. Omaha Public Library. Retrieved August 8, 2007. Storz also owned many saloons, also called \\"tied houses\\", and ran one next to his plant. In response to pressure from the Prohibition Movement, in 1907 the Nebraska Legislature passed the Gibson Law which made it illegal for breweries to own saloons. In response, Storz transferred his saloons to the Independent Realty Company. While this appeared to meet the letter of the law, in 1914 the Nebraska Supreme Court revoked an Independent Realty Company saloon's liquor license, finding that the grounds were still controlled by Storz Brewery. Additionally, they also found that the company's president was Storz's wife, Minnie; the vice-president was Maggie Buck, who was also the Storz brewer and Minnie's cousin, and; the secretary/treasurer had also previously worked for the brewery.\\"Storz: Can of the month,\\" RustyCans.com.

When Nebraskans voted to repeal the state's constitutional prohibition in 1934, Storz was again in business and quickly was making up to 150,000 barrels a year. Gottlieb Storz died in 1939.

Family Gottlieb's brother, Charles, built a fine home that today is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is his own home. His first son, Aldoph Gottlieb Storz, was born in 1884. His adopted daughter Louise was noted for her short marriage in 1912 to Carl Hans Lody, who was to win notoriety as the only German spy to be publicly tried for espionage in either World War. Lody was executed in the Tower of London in November 1914 after a spectacularly short and unsuccessful career as a spy. His marriage to Louise was equally a failure; she first filed for divorce alleging assault and battery a mere 2 months after marriage. Lody left the USA for 6 months soon after this but returned to a (blissful?) state of matrimony after the suit was withdrawn. However, Louise (or perhaps it was the whole family) was not to be denied and after reinstatement of the suit, decree nisi was eventually granted in March 1914. His son Arthur Charles Storz was born in 1890, and Robert Charles Storz was born in 1898.

It has replaced Euclidian Zoning in many new developed communities. The \\"SmartCode\\" model is a version of Form-based code that was developed by leading new- urbanist planner Andres Duany. These model of zoning codes are regulatory documents that prescribe a fundamentally different vision of how development should occur. They focus more on the form of development rather than the use. Form-Based Codes use a larger neighborhood perspective to determine the mass of buildings, their design elements, connection between sites, and their relationship to the public realm. Across the state, most zoning and subdivision regulations actually promote the sprawling development patterns that citizens generally oppose. One reason why many communities implement form-bases codes are to reduce the future impacts of urban sprawl. Form-based codes offer an opportunity to fix a city or town's zoning and subdivision rules and regulations in order to promote streetscapes that activate the public realm through careful analysis and planning. Form-based code specify what type of development a community desires versus conventional zoning which often results in development a community does not want. Form-based codes are not mere guidelines but regulatory standards to follow Another community that has used form-based codes in Massachusetts is Lowell, Massachusettshttp://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-fbc.html Key Elements Regulating Plan, A regulating plan or map of the designated planning area that shows the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded. Building Form Standards, Building Form Standards control the configuration, features and functions (such as height, massing, setback, parking and use) of buildings that define and shape the public realm. Public Space Standards, These standards set specifications for the elements within the public realm such as sidewalks, travel lanes, street trees, street furniture, bike lanes and utilities. Streetscape Standards, The primary purpose of streetscape standards are to enhance the public realm through physical improvements and provide clear standards for urban infill development via the Form-based code. Architectural Design Standards, These regulations control external architectural materials and quality. Importantly, they do not usually dictate architectural style, but rather address design on a number of broader levels to establish a matrix of standards and guidelines that will allow projects to develop over time in a consistent scale and character. Sign Standards, As with all well-crafted Form-based codes, the purpose of sign standards is not uniformity, but elimination of those elements that result in a cluttered and unattractive physical environment.http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-fbc.html Benefits The use of form-based codes, like many other smart growth tools, saves money for both developers and municipalities by streamlining the permitting process. It also protects neighborhood property values and offers a unique opportunity for municipalities to obtain the significant financial benefits of high-quality, higher-density developments. Studies have demonstrated that well-designed developments create superior property values than conventional developments with the same type of housing. This increase in value is the direct result of enhanced site amenities including uniform and consistent design standards, site layout, views, and preservation of existing cultural and historic resources.http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-fbc.html Disadvantages Some disadvantages include the lack of standardization, relative newness of the tool, the perceived support of an urban agenda, and possible gentrification. Until form-based codes become a more common practice across Massachusetts, inexperienced planners and urban designers must investigate form-based codes through a process of trial and error. Further, because of the relative newness and unconventionality associated with form- based codes, developers, local government leaders, lending institutions and homeowners could prove resistant to such a dramatic change.http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-fbc.html Early history SouthField is a Form-based code planned community located on the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station in South Weymouth, Massachusetts. It is a site south of Boston that overlaps three towns: Weymouth, Abington, and Rockland. Developed by LNR Property Corp., SouthField will contain 2,855 housing units and up to that include single-family homes, apartments, and townhouses. The site will also have up to 1.7 million square feet of commercial development, a 45-acre recreational facility, an 18-hole golf course, walking trails and 1,000 acres of undeveloped land.http://www.southfield.com The project encompasses the pre-existing South Weymouth South MBTA station (Old Colony Purple Line) and includes a new 3.5 mile parkway which will connect Route 18 with Route 3. Governor Deval Patrick has committed $42.5 million in a 30-year bond bill that includes $15 million in federal stimulus money to go with $8 million in previous federal aid.http://www.wickedlocal.com/weymouth/news/x1730864822/Hangar-set-to-come- down-at-former-Weymouth-airbase-VIDEO#axzz1pzYw0F8b New residents began moving into SouthField's first neighborhood, SouthField Highlands in 2011. The Highlands comprises four distinct (and different) residential options: The Commons (apartments), The Meadows (townhomes and single-family homes), Parkview Village (townhomes and single-family homes) and Fairing Way (55+ apartment living). The SouthField Form-Based Code community is only 12 miles south of Boston.http://news.southfield.com/2012/02/southfield-highlands-the- first-neighborhood/ Form-Based Code Regulating Plan Village Center District: This district is located centrally within the Base and is characterized by New England traditional neighborhood design. This district is intended for mixed-use, containing the highest density of housing allowed in the bylaw, as well as office, commercial, and retail spaces such as convenience stores, restaurants and shops. Main Street Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to ensure that first floor active uses (such as retail and restaurant uses) are located along the two (2) main streets of the Village Center District. Mixed-Use Village District: The primary purpose of this district is to provide a mix of residential housing types with some neighborhood commercial uses, including retail and restaurants. The density of residential uses in the district is less than the Village Center District, with fewer commercial uses. Residential District: This district serves to accommodate a lower density of housing types. Shea Village Commercial District: This district is the commercial center of the Base. Shea Village Transition Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to create an appropriate transition in the scale of buildings within ¬º mile of where this district meets the Village Center District. Golf Course/Open Space District: The purpose of this district is to facilitate operation of a public golf course and associated uses, including a club house and golf-related retail operation, and other recreational uses. If, for any reason, the golf course is not built, the only other permitted uses for the district are open space and recreational uses. Recreation District: This district is established to foster passive and active indoor and outdoor recreational uses on the Base and will house some institutional uses already existing and required within the Base. Open Space-Corporation District: The primary purpose of this district is to encourage the preservation of large contiguous wetland areas and open space for park land, active and passive recreation, reservations, community gardens, rivers and streams, and similar uses. Coast Guard District: This district is the area currently used by the United States Coast Guard for housing.http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/CS-fbc-s- weymouth.html Notes Category:Weymouth, Massachusetts ","title":"SouthField, Massachusetts (development)"},{"id":"12679385","text":"Captain Peter ‚ÄúWrongway‚Äù Peachfuzz was a supporting character on the animated television programs Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show, now known collectively as The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. He made his debut in Jet Fuel Formula, the first Rocky & Bullwinkle story arc, originally broadcast late 1959 and early 1960. According to the narration of Jet Fuel Formula, Peachfuzz was, from his youngest days, an incompetent sailor. As a child, even his toy boats sank. At the age of 18 he joined the Navy. He was awarded numerous medals, all of which were donated by the enemy. Sailing the wrong way through the Panama Canal and becoming the only captain of an icebreaker in the South Seas earned him the nickname \\"Wrongway\\" (an allusion to the American pilot Douglas \\"Wrong Way\\" Corrigan). After receiving a large inheritance from an aunt, he purchased and took command of the S.S. Andalusia (called Athabaska in some episodes). His crew considered mutiny but decided rather to install a dummy control room, so that Peachfuzz would think he was in command, while the crew actually controlled the ship from another location. Unfortunately, Peachfuzz took a wrong turn and wound up in the real control room. In another episode Peachfuzz tried to dive overboard to help Rocky save Bullwinkle but, being Peachfuzz, he only succeeded in diving up and back onto the ship. In Upsidaisium, it is revealed that Peachfuzz eventually sailed his ship up Wall Street, whereupon the S.S. Andalusia was given a permanent street address: 17¬Ω Wall Street. In an effort to get rid of him, his board of directors arranged for him to get a government job counting penguin eggs (Q.2) because \\"we couldn't find any place further away.\\" However, the secretary, a niece of the captain, mistyped the order and as a result Peachfuzz is made head of G.2, the main spy agency (Government Intelligence System). As \\"the muddle-headed head\\" of G.2, Peachfuzz demonstrates more examples of his usual incompetence when he tries to confiscate telephone books (because they list his name and telephone number) and sets up dozens of pairs of spies (who only spy on each other); likewise in Greenpernt Oogle, it is revealed that, having attacked the Supreme Court Building (thinking they are enemy agents, again satirizing real-life criticism of the Warren Court's numerous controversial decisions of the era), he is reassigned to the one place felt fit for a man who is wrong all the time: the Weather Bureau. For a time he replaced the Greenpernt Oogle as the chief adviser for New Greenpernt, with the instructions to do the opposite of what he said. The Goof Gas Attack story arc mentions Peachfuzz as being an alumnus of Waxahatchee Normal School (as part of a pun that, having reverted \\"back to normal\\" after being hit by goof gas, he had returned to his alma mater for a short visit). Peachfuzz's voice was provided by \\"Disney Legend\\" Paul Frees. At first he spoke with a high-pitched squawk reminiscent of a stereotypical cartoon parrot, but soon adopted another voice based on that of Ed Wynn. According to Jay Ward's widow Billie Ward, the captain was named for Rocky and Bullwinkle producer Peter Piech. Other appearances In addition to appearing in several Rocky & Bullwinkle story arcs, Peachfuzz appeared in the supporting feature The Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club. Peachfuzz makes his return after nearly 50 years in Dreamworks Animation's 2014 short film, Rocky and Bullwinkle. He was voiced by Stephen Stanton. In the short, he served as the officiant and DJ at the wedding between Bullwinkle and a robotic female moose controlled by Boris Badenov. In the 2018 reboot The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, the character has been reimagined as being renamed Director Peachfuzz, an African-American woman who is the head of a secret government organization called S.H.H. She is a major antagonist-heroine. She is also more competent and ill-tempered than the original Peachfuzz.

He was born in Oni, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) into the family of the leading Georgian Zionist David Baazov. At the age of 14, he published his first poems under the pen name of Ger-Bi (1918). In the 1920s, he systematically published poems, historical stories and journalistic essays in Georgian-Jewish press and garnered acclaim with his Georgian translation of Song of Songs in 1924. In 1925, he organized a Tbilisi-based Georgian-Jewish dramatic troupe \\"Kadima\\" and began writing plays depicting the life of the Georgian Jews. In 1927, he graduated from the Faculty of Law, Tbilisi State University, and briefly served as a lawyer. Through his 1928 play Dilleamari (·Éì·Éò·Éö·Éö·Éî·Éê·Éõ·Éê·É†·Éò), Baazov established himself as a leading writer in Georgian on Jewish themes. He was the first Jewish writer to introduce the subject matter of the life-style, character, and routine life of Georgian Jews into Georgian literature. In an amazingly brief period, Baazov wrote ten plays (notably The Mutes Began to Speak [·Éõ·É£·Éú·ÉØ·Éî·Éë·Éò ·Éê·Éö·Éê·Éû·Éê·É†·Éê·Éô·Éì·Éú·Éî·Éú, 1931], Without Respect of Persons [·Éí·Éê·Éú·É£·É†·É©·Éî·Éï·Éö·Éê·Éì ·Éû·Éò·É†·Éù·Éï·Éú·Éî·Éë·Éò·É°·Éê, 1933], Itska Rizhinashvili [·Éò·É™·Éô·Éê ·É†·Éò·Éü·Éò·Éú·Éê·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò, 1936], etc.), most of which became standard items in Georgian repertory in the 1930s. Early in the 1930s, he conceived a trilogy on the Georgian Jews, the first part of which ‚Äì Pethaim ‚Äì appeared in Georgian (·É§·Éî·Éó·ÉÆ·Éê·Éò·Éú·Éò, 1934) and Russian (–ü–µ—Ç—Ö–∞–π–Ω, 1936). His prolific work was terminated by the Soviet political repressions under Stalin. In 1937, he was arrested in Moscow and extradited to Tbilisi where he was either shot or tortured to death during the interrogation. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955.

The event was created in 1968 as Grand Prix de Fayt-le-Franc, named after the former municipality where it started and finished. In 1970 it was renamed Grand Prix Jos√© Samyn as a tribute to Jos√© Samyn, the race's first winner who died in a race accident in 1969. Johan Capiot holds the record with three wins. History Since 2005, the race is included in the UCI Europe Tour as a 1.1 event. It is the first race of the season in Wallonia, held on the Wednesday after its Flemish counterpart, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. The race is run entirely in the province of Hainaut, starting in Quaregnon and finishing in Dour. During the course, 16 sectors of cobbled roads are traversed, prompting Belgian media to call it The Little Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. The 2005 edition was cancelled because snow had made the roads too dangerous. Since 2012, a women's edition of the race, named Le Samyn des Dames, is held on the same day as the men's race.

Early life Brooks was born on April 6, 1976 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was adopted at birth. Brooks has described himself on his old MySpace page as \\"a poor black child from the mean streets of West Philly...the REAL West Philly, not that suburb 'Fresh Prince' was from.\\" Brooks' father passed away when he was 12, and he was then raised by his mother and two older sisters. Growing up, Brooks studied classical piano from age 5 to 15, performing in many recitals. Throughout his teens, he was heavily involved in his local church, he was a competitive swimmer, ran track, and played JV baseball (for which he earned a letter). From ages 11 to 18 he acted in many plays for a neighborhood theater group, and when he was 19 he studied acting at the John Barth acting studios in Philadelphia. Brooks received several academic awards during high school (Art, English, History), and after graduation, he attended college as a business management major. After one year he left school, and he and his best friend borrowed money from their parents and opened their own business; a popular neighborhood video rental store. After 4 years and 2 stores, Brooks and his partner sold the business. Soon after, he took his first job in the nightlife industry as a bouncer in a local \\"gentleman's club\\", which turned into a ten-year career in the Philadelphia nightclub scene, becoming a well-known doorman and head of security. Also during this time, along with several co-workers, Brooks became a partner in an infamous, underground, after-hours nightclub. While Brooks was working in the Philadelphia nightclub scene, his childhood friend Charles Stone was making a name for himself in New York City as a music video director. Starting back when they were in high school, Stone would often cast Brooks in his school projects, short films and music videos. In 1998, Stone came up with the original \\"Whassup\\" concept; a three-minute film entitled True. When he decided to make the film, Stone told Brooks, \\"It‚Äôs based on us, and something we used to do back in the day.\\" \\"True\\" was a huge hit on the independent film festival circuit, which led to it becoming a popular \\"party tape\\"...it was being dubbed and bootleg copies were being passed around all across the country. One such bootleg made it into the hands of Vinny Warren, an ad exec at the DDB-Needham advertising agency. Budweiser was a client of DDB, so, Vinny approached August Busch IV, CEO of Anheuser-Busch, and sold him on the idea of turning True into a series of TV commercials. When production began on the commercials, Stone called Brooks and urged him to come to New York for an audition. He had never acted professionally before, and this was his first audition. After a week of auditions, and 3 call-backs, Brooks beat out 250 other actors, and was given the title role of \\"Dookie.\\" The commercials were shot over 3 days in November 1999 in locations around New York City. For a short while, Brooks continued to work as a bouncer even after the commercials debuted, unaware of how his life was about to change. Overnight success Brooks shot to celebrity overnight thanks to the success of the \\"Whassup\\" commercials. The campaign ran for over two-years, with 12 commercials. The specific popularity of Brooks' character \\"Dookie\\" prompted Anheuser-Busch to create several commercials based around his solo adventures. The New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, Vibe, TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, The New Yorker, People and Forbes, as well as many other magazines and newspapers across the country, all featured articles about the sensation surrounding the commercials. Brooks has also been interviewed or featured on many national & local television & radio shows, including: The Tonight Show, Oprah, Entertainment Tonight, The Today Show, CBS This Morning, Live with Regis and Kathy Lee, The Howard Stern Show, WWF Raw, 48 Hours, Inside Edition, Talk Soup, E! News Daily, VH1's The 25 Greatest, CBS's Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials, TNN's Fame for 15', The 2000 Source Awards, the A&E; documentary America's Favorite TV Commercials, and the BBC's television special Best Ads Ever. To this day, the commercials are routinely featured in magazine articles and television specials as one of the top 10 TV commercials and Super Bowl commercials of all time. The commercials were nominated for an Emmy, won the 2000 Grand Clio Award for Best Campaign and Best Commercial, and \\"Wasabi\\" (one of Brooks' solo commercials) won the 2000 Cannes Film Festival Golden Lion Award for Best Commercial in the world. Brooks also won a Best Actor Award from the Black Emmy Association. After \\"Whassup!\\" After the initial success of the commercials, the \\"Whassup Guys\\" signed a development deal with Paramount Television to create and star in a new television series, and became the hosts of ABC's prime time series Best Commercials You‚Äôve Never Seen. Later, Brooks went on to become the solo host of the Best Commercials... series, he also landed a development deal with Banyan Productions, with 2 pilots in consideration by major networks. In January 2002, Scott called into the Howard Stern show to say that although he was making up to $5000 a night doing appearances at bars, he wanted to do something else before he was only ever known as \\"The Wassup Guy\\". Howard told him he should keep doing it until there's no more money, but Scott insisted that he was finished with doing \\"Wassup Guy\\" appearances. Throughout the 2000s, Brooks continued to pursue his acting career, landing several TV and feature film roles, including; UPN's The Parkers, CBS's Hack, Fox's Jonny Zero, New Line Cinema's Dumb and Dumberer and Disney's Mr. 3000. He also continued his commercial career, doing commercials for major brands such as Mcdonald's, The WE Network, and Dodge Truck. Brooks added another popular catchphrase to his resume when he was featured in one of the Dr. Scholl's \\"Are You Gellin'?\\" TV commercials. In 2004, Brooks became the voice of Church's Chicken in their television and radio ads. From 2009 - 2010, he was the host of the Verizon-Fios \\"Home 2.0 Makover Show\\", a series of promotional infommercials for the company.

Their bombs fell over two kilometers away, damaging no civilian structures, but downed some tram lines and destroyed a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. It was not until 1947 that Thai authorities learned of the intended target.

Its 200-foot (61m) white tapered steel mast rises above Denver's northwestern skyline, connected to the bridge deck and foundation anchors by steel cables. This unique footbridge crosses railroad tracks and the regional light rail system, climbing no higher than 25 feet (8m) above street level, thereby minimizing the height pedestrians must climb. Located near LoDo (Denver's lower downtown),in Riverfront Park, the Millennium Bridge connects the popular 16th Street Mall with the Commons Park in the Central Platte Valley District of the Union Station neighborhood. The bridge is the first of three pedestrian bridges between Downtown Denver and the Highland neighborhood. Design The name, Denver Millennium Bridge, honors a milestone in time and in Denver's architectural development. To meet the structural challenge of spanning 130 feet (40m) without a steep increase in elevation, the deck's structure must be as thin as possible while remaining stable. This cable-stayed bridge uses a steel frame that derives its stiffness from tension by using a single mast that is tilted toward one end of the bridge. Cables supporting the bridge deck are welded to both sides of the mast, but cable to foundation anchors attach to the mast only from the side of the bridge toward which the mast is tilted. Supportive tension is created by using the mast as a lever to pull the deck up into a shallow arc, keeping the opposite end of the bridge secured by two steel rods. With the mast raised, concrete was poured onto the metal deck frame, pushing the deck into place and applying tension to the cables. The post-tensioned structural construction allows for a substantially thinner 6-inch-thick reinforced concrete slab-on- metal deck. The deck structure is supported by secondary I-Beams, and has an average width of 80 feet (24m). History Preliminary work on the $9-million footbridge began in 1999. The structural and civil engineering firm Ove Arup & Partners, in conjunction with the architectural design company ArchitectureDenver, developed the design. Contractor Edward Kraemer & Sons, Inc. implemented the design, subcontracting Colorado Bridge and Iron to fabricate the steel components. The mast was constructed of cone-shaped steel plate sections welded together to form a 3-foot (1m) base, 7-foot (2m) midsection and 1.5-foot (.5m) tip diameter. Glass-enclosed elevator towers on both ends of the footbridge accommodate pedestrians who have difficulty climbing the stairs leading up to either end of the bridge from street level. The Millennium Bridge was completed and officially opened by Denver Mayor Wellington Webb on April 22, 2002. On April 24, 2014, a $1-million renovation began on the footbridge to increase pedestrian accessibility to the bridge, which allows for smoother access between downtown Denver and the Central Platte Valley and Lower Highlands neighborhoods. Part of this renovation includes modifications to the east staircase and an upgrade to LED lighting which will allow for the colors to be changed and increase energy efficiency by up to 80%.http://www.confluence-denver.com/devnews/millennium_042214.aspx See also *Platte River Bridge *Highland Bridge Awards *2002 Urban Design Merit Award, Denver Chapter American Institute of Architects *Gold Award, New York Association of Consulting Engineers \\"Engineering Excellence Awards 2003\\" Photo galleryReferences *Wagner, Hol ‚ÄúMillennium Bridge Rising in Denver‚Äôs Central Platte Valley‚Äù, Rocky Mountain Construction (August 27, 2001) *‚ÄúMast-Raising Creates New Denver Landmark‚Äù (June 22, 2001) Colorado Construction‚ÄîNewswatch *‚ÄúInnovative Engineering in Colorado‚Äù Engineer It!

Personal Appearance was produced by the legendary Brock Pemberton (founder of the Tony Awards) and staged by Antoinette Perry (in whose memory Pemberton named the Tonys). It opened in 1934 at New York's Henry Miller Theatre starring the famed stage and screen actress Gladys George (now remembered especially for her role as Miles Archer's spouse in the film The Maltese Falcon). Her comic performance contributed to making Personal Appearance a Broadway hit that lasted for 501 performances. It launched Riley's career as a playwright and remains his most famous play. The New York Times characterized Personal Appearance in an October 18, 1934, review's headline as a \\"Satire of the Hollywood Dementia.\\" The play is set in the Pennsylvania backcountry, where Riley was originally from and where he long resided. It is the story of a movie star and diva, Carole Arden, who is on a tour giving personal appearances to promote her latest film, Drifting Lady. Her car breaks down, which leads to her encounter with a young and handsome gas station attendant, Chester Norton, played by Philip Ober. His fianc√©e's parents put Arden up for the night and Arden falls for Norton. But her down-to-earth press agent, Gene Tuttle, played by Otto Hulett, foils her plans to bring Norton to Hollywood with her. This frothy and satirical entertainment epitomizes Pemberton's productions at the time: He was among those who advocated such escapist fare as needed psychological relief during the Great Depression. This was in opposition to socially relevant stage productions, such as Marc Blitzstein's musical The Cradle Will Rock (1937). Personal Appearance's huge success only reinforced Pemberton in his opinion. In 1935, Samuel French (the English- speaking world's leading theatrical publisher) produced both a hardcover and a softcover edition of Personal Appearance: a New Comedy in Three Acts in Los Angeles and New York. Personal Appearance was adapted for the screen by Mae West as Go West, Young Man. It was directed by Henry Hathaway and released by Paramount in 1936. In it, West reprises George's role but with a more callous and cynical slant. It was one of the rare instances, perhaps the first, in which West starred in a role not originally conceived for her.

He was known as \\"The Duke.\\" Bellizzi was born in New York to Albanian immigrants Samuel and Teresa Bellizzi. An up-and-coming young jockey in Thoroughbred racing, during 1933 Dominick Bellizzi rode to victory in the Futurity at Chicago's Arlington Park for Charles T. Fisher's Dixiana Farm. Competing on the New York circuit, he won the Adirondack Stakes and for the prominent Brookmeade Stable, owned by heiress Isabel Dodge Sloane, he captured both the Toboggan Handicap and the Whitney Handicap. In 1934, Dominick Bellizzi rode Brookmeade's colt High Quest to victory in the Wood Memorial Stakes, an important prep race for the Kentucky Derby. However, trainer Robert A. Smith opted to run the stable's Florida Derby winner Time Clock in the Derby and under Bellizzi, finished seventh. A week after the Kentucky Derby, Dominick Bellizzi was back in New York where he rode Brookmeade's Psychic Bid in the Youthful Stakes at Jamaica Race Course. As the field turned for home, the promising but still immature two-year-old colt veered wide and when Bellizzi attempted to guide him back in, the bit slipped in the horse's mouth. The motion caused the young jockey to lose his balance and he was thrown from his mount into the path of several onrushing horses. Severely injured, Bellizzi was rushed to Marymount Hospital in Jamaica, Queens. He underwent surgery for his injuries, which included a broken spine and damage to his intestines, and died five days later. Bellizzi, whose coffin was carried by 10 other jockeys as pallbearers, was buried in his jockey uniform.

This Gothic Revival structure originally served as a place of worship for the slaves at the Bremo Plantation of General John Hartwell Cocke. Cocke was deeply concerned with the religious and moral state of his slaves, which drove him to construct this chapel. The building was moved in the late 19th century from its original location on the plantation and is now used as the parish hall for the Grace Episcopal Church in Bremo Bluff. Bremo Slave Chapel was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in December 1979 and the National Register of Historic Places in March 1980. History John Hartwell Cocke Although John Hartwell Cocke owned slaves at Bremo Plantation, he was opposed to the institution in principle and believed it was his obligation as their master to instruct his slaves and eventually return them to the African continent. Cocke first constructed a brick structure on the plantation in 1825 for his slaves, who had been gathering for worship as early as 1821. In 1834, Cocke began constructing the schoolhouse-style building and hired a student from Princeton Theological Seminary to teach his slaves. However, the instructor left by September 1835 because of local public outcry against teaching slaves. Cocke had been publicly confronted and badly beaten that year for his efforts. Teaching literacy to slaves was illegal at that time in the state. Cocke later recruited young Presbyterian minister Courtland Van Rensselaer to minister to his slaves. Van Rensselaer dedicated the chapel on behalf of the slaves in November 1837. Post-abolition use The chapel was no longer used for some time after the American Civil War. John Hartwell Cocke died in 1866 and slavery had been abolished by the time the plantation was passed down to his surviving son Cary Charles Cocke. In 1881, Cary Charles Cocke, William Cocke and Charles E. Cosby purchased land in Bremo Bluff that would become the present site of the chapel. By February 14, 1884, the building had been moved east from Chapel Field in Lower Bremo to the village center of Bremo Bluff, where it was consecrated as Grace Church by Episcopal Bishop Alfred M. Randolph. Services were held at this location until a newer brick church was built in 1924 and the chapel was moved a short distance to the north, where it was severely damaged by a falling tree the following year. After substantial reconstruction, it has since been used as the parish hall. Architecture The identity of the architect is uncertain, but is presumed by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources to be John Hartwell Cocke. The rectangular brick foundation is arranged in a stretcher bond. The building measures by , and is covered by a simple gable roof with slate shingles and three chimneys. The exterior walls utilize board and batten construction. The main entrance on the east side features Gothic double doors; the chapel's sash windows are similarly arched. The interior includes an auditorium, a sanctuary, and a kitchen in the back. The building underwent significant modification during its move in the late 19th century and a vestry was added in the 20th century. Brick facing and steps with an iron railing were added to the front of the chapel in 1966.

News, August 18, 2007. It is also the highest-rated episode of Hannah Montana ever. The episode also marked the Jonas Brothers' debut on Disney Channel. They have since starred in the film Camp Rock and the series Jonas, among other programs. The episode also led to the Jonas Brothers touring with Miley Cyrus on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008. Plot Hannah Montana impatiently waits at the recording studios to start work with her father Robby Stewart. She finally barges in on an occupied studio room and is surprised to find the Jonas Brothers at work. The band and Hannah meet each other, both mutually starstruck. But when Robby introduces himself, the Jonas Brothers instantly recognize him as \\"Robbie Ray,\\" Hannah's song-writing father. The boys soon appear to be more interested in speaking with Robby than with Hannah. Over the next several days, Robby develops a friendship with the Jonas Brothers and even writes a song for them. (\\"We Got the Party\\") Miley becomes jealous and suspects that Robby will enjoy writing for them more than he does writing for Hannah. She and Lilly devise a plan to make the Jonas Brothers lose respect for Robby as a songwriter. Miley and Lilly dress up as male rockers \\"Milo\\" and \\"Otis,\\" go back to the recording studios, and play their own version of \\"We Got the Party\\" in front of the Jonas Brothers. When the brothers claim that Robbie Ray wrote the song for them, Milo (Miley) tells them that he and Otis (Lily) in fact wrote the song and that Robbie Ray stole it from them. The Jonas Brothers apologize and let Milo and Otis have the song, but just then Robby arrives. Miley and Lilly quickly hide and Robby straightens things out with the Jonas Brothers. Miley later calls the Jonas Brothers (as Hannah) and tells them that she hired Milo and Otis as a prank. Robby assures Miley that he still loves writing songs for Hannah, and that he had a vision about having her collaborate with the Jonas Brothers on a future recording. Later at an evening beach concert, Hannah and the Jonas Brothers perform \\"We Got the Party\\" together. Later Robby and Miley stalk through the recording studios with marshmallow guns looking for the Jonas Brothers. Assuming they are in the studio room, they again barge in, only to find a gospel choir in the middle of recording \\"When the Saints Go Marching In.\\" As Robby and Miley sheepishly leave the room, they come out and wondered why they weren't there, because they promised they would be. Then, Joe emerges from around the corner and says, \\"And we always keep our promises!\\" The other brothers emerge and Miley says, \\"Duck and cover daddy, it's Return of the Jonai!\\" before they start their marshmallow war.

Presented as a beautiful femme fatale, she won her people the Kingdom of Kent through her treacherous seduction of Vortigern. Contemporary sources do not mention Rowena, which leads modern historians to regard her as fictitious. Name The name \\"Rowena\\" does not appear in Old English sources such as Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People and the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle. It was first recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his 12th- century Historia Regum Britanniae (in various spellings, including Ronwen, Renwein, and Romwenna), and may represent a Medieval Latin corruption of some lost Old English or other Germanic name. Another possibility is that it comes from the Brittonic languages, where the name becomes Welsh Rhonwen; this could be connected to the word \\"horsehair\\" (), which might be significant given her father and uncle's association with horses, but this is simply conjecture based on similarity of pronunciation. Attestations=Historia Brittonum She is first mentioned in the 9th century Historia Brittonum (traditionally attributed to Nennius) as the lovely unnamed daughter of the mythological figure, the Saxon Hengist. Following his brother, Horsa, and his arrival at Ynys Ruym (modern Isle of Thanet), Hengist negotiates with the King of the Britons, Vortigern, for more land. At her father's orders, Rowena gets Vortigern drunk at a feast, and he is so enchanted by her, he agrees to give her father whatever he wants in exchange for permission to marry her (the fate of Vortigern's first wife, Sevira, daughter of Magnus Maximus, is not specified). The text makes clear that the British king's lust for a pagan woman is a prompting by the Devil. Hengist demands the Kingdom of Kent, which Vortigern foolishly grants him. This agreement proves disastrous for the Britons and allows the Saxons to strengthen their foothold in Britain considerably. According to the Historia Brittonum, Vortigern \\"and his wives\\" (Rowena/Rhonwen is not named directly) were burned alive by heavenly fire in the fortress of Craig Gwrtheyrn \\"Vortigern's Rock\\" in North Wales. Geoffrey of Monmouth Geoffrey of Monmouth's work Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain, circa 1138) was the first to give Hengist's daughter a name, Rowena, though the spelling varies widely by manuscript. According to Geoffrey, Vortigern usurps the throne of Britain from the rightful king Constans. Geoffrey claims the drunken seduction of Vortigern created the tradition of toasting in Britain. Vortigern's friendly dealings with the Saxons, especially his allowing even more settlers to join them, causes his sons by his first wife to rebel. His eldest son Vortimer takes the British throne and drives out the Saxons, but he is poisoned by Rowena, who assumes a wicked stepmother role. Later, the Saxons kill all the British leaders at the Treachery of the Long Knives, sparing Vortigern because of Rowena. With her use of seduction and potions, Geoffrey's Rowena (a character whom the scholar Edward Augustus Freeman described as \\"a later absurdity\\") perhaps served as a basis for later villainesses of the Matter of Britain such as Morgan le Fay, and can be contrasted with his positive portrayal of British queens like Cordelia of Britain and Marcia. Another similar character is Estrildis, the rival of Queen Gwendolen, also a beautiful Germanic princess. The marriage of Rowena in the Gesta Regum Anglorum by William of Malmesbury, a work contemporaneous with Monmouth's Historia, serves as an exemplum of the unification of ruling families after conquest, in this case Briton and German, thus legitimating the authority of the couple's descendants. Malmesbury had in mind Henry I and Matilda, whose marriage in 1100 had united for the first time the lineages, respectively, of the Normans and Anglo-Saxons.‚ÄúEdith Becomes Matilda.‚Äù England in Europe: English Royal Women and Literary Patronage, C.1000‚ÄìC.1150, by ELIZABETH M.

From Vortigernstudies.org.uk. Retrieved September 29, 2007. Frisian tradition In the Spiegel historiael (Mirror of History) by the Flemish writer Jacob van Maerlant (1284-89) Rowena's father Engistus is considered to be Frisian; 15th century chronicles identify him as the founder of the city of Leiden. His daughter Ronixe is introduced by Cornelius Aurelius in the famous Divisiekroniek (1517). From then on, Rowena is considered to be a Frisian princess (the current form Ronixa is derived from French sources). In Frisia, as in Britain, it was the custom that women welcomed visitors with a kiss. Therefore, Frisians began to believe that Rowena had introduced the custom of kissing in England. According to the Frisian historian Pieter Winsemius (1622) it was Rowena's Frisian kiss that seduced Vortigern to marry her. Later adaptations She was a titular character in William Henry Ireland's play Vortigern and Rowena (1796). Her name was later borrowed by Walter Scott for the beautiful Saxon heroine in his historical novel Ivanhoe (1819), after which it came into use as an English given name. (Presumably due to the original legendary Rowena's character flaws, her name was not commonly used until after the appearance of Ivanhoe.)

The gonads initially develop from the mesothelial layer of the peritoneum. The ovary is differentiated into a central part, the medulla, covered by a surface layer, the germinal epithelium. The immature ova originate from cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac. Once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells). In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. In the testis, a network of tubules fuse to create the seminiferous tubules. Via the rete testis, the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the mesonephros, which form the efferent ducts of the testis. The descent of the testes consists of the opening of a connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the testis. A failure in this process causes an indirect inguinal hernia. Germ cells migrate from near the allantois and colonize the primordial gonads. In the female, the germ cells colonise the cortex and become oogonia. In the male, the germ cells colonise the seminiferous cords of the medulla, becoming spermatogonia. Before differentiation The first appearance of the gonad is essentially the same in the two sexes, and consists in a thickening of the mesothelial layer of the peritoneum. The thick plate of epithelium extends deeply, pushing before it the mesoderm and forming a distinct projection. This is termed the gonadal ridge. The gonadal ridge, in turn, develops into a gonad. This is a testis in the male and an ovary in the female. At first, the mesonephros and gonadal ridge are continuous, but as the embryo grows the gonadal ridge gradually becomes pinched off from the mesonephros. However, some cells of mesonephric origin join the gonadal ridge. Furthermore, the gonadal ridge still remains connected to the remnant of that body by a fold of peritoneum, namely the mesorchium or mesovarium. About the seventh week the distinction of sex in the gonadal ridge begins to be perceptible. Ovary The ovary is thus formed mainly from the genital ridge and partly from the mesonephros. Later the mass is differentiated into a central part, the medulla of ovary, covered by a surface layer, the germinal epithelium. Between the cells of the germinal epithelium a number of larger cells, the immature ova, are found. The immature ova, in turn, are carried into the stroma beneath by bud-like ingrowths (genital cords of the germinal epithelium). The surface germinal epithelium ultimately forms the permanent epithelial covering of this organ. Furthermore, it soon loses its connection with the central mass. Instead, the tunica albuginea of the ovaries develops between them. Origin of ova During early embryonic development, cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac migrate along the hindgut to the gonadal ridge. These primordial germ cells (PGCs) multiply by mitosis and once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia (diploid stem cells of the ovary). Once oogonia enter this area they attempt to associate with the other somatic cells, derived from both the peritoneum and mesonephros. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells) in an irregular manner. In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. Origin of granulosa cells The embryological origin of granulosa cells remains controversial. In the 1970s, evidence emerged that the first cells to make contact with the oogonia were of mesonephric origin. It was suggested that mesonephric cells already closely associated with the oogonia proliferated throughout development to form the granulosa cell layer.Zamboni, L., Bezard, J., and Mauleon, P. (1979). The role of the mesonephros in the development of the sheep fetal ovary. Annales de Biologie Animal Biochimie et Biophysique 19, 1153-78. Recently this hypothesis has been challenged with some thorough histology. Sawyer et al. hypothesized that in sheep most of the granulosa cells develop from cells of the mesothelium (i.e., epithelial cells from the presumptive surface epithelium of the ovary). Descent of the ovaries Just as in the male, there is a gubernaculum in the female, which effects a considerable change in the position of the ovary, though not so extensive a change as in that of the testis. The gubernaculum in the female lies in contact with the fundus of the uterus and adheres to this organ, and thus the ovary can only descend as far as to this level. The part of the gubernaculum between the ovary and the uterus ultimately becomes the proper ovarian ligament, while the part between the uterus and the labium majus forms the round ligament of the uterus. A pouch of peritoneum analogous to the vaginal process in the male accompanies it along the inguinal canal: it is called the canal of Nuck. =Pathology= In rare cases, the gubernaculum may fail to contract adhesions to the uterus, and then the ovary descends through the inguinal canal into the labium majus; under these circumstances, its position resembles that of the testis. Testis The testis is developed in much the same way as the ovary, originating from mesothelium as well as mesonephros. Like the ovary, in its earliest stages it consists of a central mass covered by a surface epithelium. In the central mass a series of cords appear, and the periphery of the mass is converted into the tunica albuginea, thus excluding the surface epithelium from any part in the formation of the tissue of the testis. The cords of the central mass run together toward the future hilum and form a network which ultimately becomes the rete testis. On the other hand, the seminiferous tubules are developed from the cords distal to the hilum, and between them connective-tissue septa extend. Via the rete testis, the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the mesonephros, which form the efferent ducts of the testis. Descent of the testes The descent of the testes consists of the opening of a connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the testis. =Opening of connection= At an early period of fetal life the testes are placed at the back part of abdominal cavity, behind the peritoneum, and each is attached by a peritoneal fold, the mesorchium, to the mesonephros. From the front of the mesonephros a fold of peritoneum termed the inguinal fold grows forward to meet and fuse with a peritoneal fold, the inguinal crest, which grows backward from the antero-lateral abdominal wall. The testis thus acquires an indirect connection with the anterior abdominal wall. At the same time, a portion of the peritoneal cavity lateral to these fused folds is marked off as the future vaginal process. =Development of gubernaculum= Also, in the inguinal crest a structure, the gubernaculum testis, makes its appearance. This is at first a slender band, extending from that part of the skin of the groin which afterward forms the scrotum through the inguinal canal to the body and epididymis of the testis. As development advances, the peritoneum enclosing the gubernaculum forms two folds, one above the testis and the other below it. The one above the testis is the plica vascularis, and contains the upper part of the gubernaculum, and ultimately also the internal spermatic vessels; the one below, the plica gubernatrix, contains the lower part of the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum grows into a thick cord. It ends below at the abdominal inguinal ring in a tube of peritoneum, the vaginal process, which protrudes itself down the inguinal canal. By the fifth month the lower part of the gubernaculum still is a thick cord, while the upper part has disappeared. The lower part now consists of a central core of smooth muscle fibers, surrounded by a firm layer of striated muscle elements, connected, behind the peritoneum, with the abdominal wall. =Translocation= As the testes develops, the main portion of the lower end of the gubernaculum is carried, following the skin to which it is attached, to the bottom of this pouch. Other bands are carried to the medial side of the thigh and to the perineum. The tube of peritoneum constituting the vaginal process projects itself downward into the inguinal canal, and emerges at the external inguinal ring, pushing before it a part of the obliquus internus and the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, which form respectively the cremaster muscle and the external spermatic fascia. The vaginal process forms a gradually elongating pouch, which eventually reaches the bottom of the scrotum, and behind this pouch the testis is drawn by the growth of the body of the fetus, for the gubernaculum does not grow proportionately with the growth of other parts, and therefore the testis, being attached by the gubernaculum to the bottom of the scrotum, is prevented from rising as the body grows, and is instead drawn first into the inguinal canal and eventually into the scrotum. It seems certain also that the gubernacular cord becomes shortened as development proceeds, and this assists in causing the testis to reach the bottom of the scrotum. =Closing of connection= indirect, scrotal inguinal hernia (median view from the left). By the end of the eighth month the testis has reached the scrotum, preceded by the vaginal process, which communicates by its upper extremity with the peritoneal cavity. Just before birth the upper part of the vaginal process, at the internal inguinal ring, usually becomes closed, and this obliteration extends gradually downward to within a short distance of the testis. The process of peritoneum surrounding the testis is now entirely cut off from the general peritoneal cavity and constitutes the tunica vaginalis. Pathology If the internal inguinal ring does not close properly, then there is a risk that other contents of the abdominal cavity protrudes through the passageway and cause indirect inguinal hernia.

Rowe. Mr. Rowe, a printer at Hampton Institute, began the Sunday School with three Newtown children, in a small section of his home. The Sunday School became so popular that they needed more space to hold the Bible sessions. History In 1869, Daniel F. Cock set aside a triangular plot of thirty-five acres divided into thirty-three lots to be sold to black persons. This area was named \\"Cock's Newtown. In March 1870, the first six lots were sold at fifty dollars each. The last was sold in 1910. During this same period, blacks also purchased lots of comparable size at the same price from Charles Smith, Edward Whitehouse, and William N. Armstrong, brother of Samuel Armstrong, Principal of Hampton Institute. These lots were close to \\"Cock's Newtown\\" or close to the area where the Little England Chapel now stands. Subsequently, \\"Newtown\\" was applied to the entire black community. In 1878, a large open arbor was built with ten rows of seating for academic and Sunday School classes on the property of Daniel Cock. The number of attendees grew to over 500 ‚Äì too many to be accommodated in the open arbor. During that same summer Mr. Rowe met with William N. Armstrong, who offered the use of a small piece of land along Ivy Home Road, if the residents in the neighborhood would contribute toward the support of a day school teacher. The money was raised and the chapel opened in 1879. Students from Hampton Institute not only designed but built the school house. The work was overseen by William Armstrong. By 1886, the chapel had become self-supporting and had grown from three to seventy children. The children of the chapel participated in missionary work for the community. As late as 1910, students from the institute rowed across the Hampton River to teach classes. In later years, they would travel by horse and buggy and the \\"School Chariot\\", a black shiny carriage drawn by two white horses. The students would serve as missionaries of the chapel for over fifty years.

The facility The Golden Boughs consists largely of a series of cottages assigned to the various inmates, along with a number of public buildings such as a pub, plus the various buildings required to run the place.

The Comet V has been in use by New York metropolitan area commuter rail operators New Jersey Transit and Metro- North since April 2002. Layout and design Suffern The main design of the Comet V is similar to its predecessors starting with the Comet III. Each trailer car has six doors for entering and exiting (like the Comet IV, the cab cars have five doors); the doors at the ends of the car are single-leaf with trap doors for low-level boarding while those in the middle are double-leaf but lack steps and trapdoors, only opening at high platform stations. The length of the cars at over the couplers remains unchanged from previous models and their width adheres to the standard loading gauge of . The one unique feature of Comet V cab cars, compared to earlier Comets and especially the Comet IV, is the lack of steps and a trapdoor at the door in the vestibule opposite the engineer's operating position. Like the Comet IV, the engineer's side of the cab vestibule has no door. The interiors of the trains have significant differences from previous Comet railcars, featuring redesigned seats and windows that are larger than previous Comet coaches. There are also new LED digital information displays along with slightly more seating. Major external differences include a stainless-steel exterior and visible, roof- mounted air conditioning units. The Comet V was the inspiration for the Bombardier MultiLevel Coach, which began construction in 2006. Door problems One prominent problem of the Comet V is failures in its door- opening mechanism. On the Comet V, Alstom added a new button to open vestibule doors that lead to the end doors labeled with \\"push to open.\\" This led to confusion among passengers about how to open the doors; eventually many resorted to opening them manually. The Comet V's software glitches came to light as doors failed to open or malfunctioned.

Today it is regarded as offering a strong insight into the state of black education in the years between the U.S. Civil War and Brown vs. Board of Education. This Henry County, Virginia school soon added another room, and operated as an educational institution until the mid-1950s, when it was consolidated into a larger segregated school. Similar to most other black schools, Rock Run School was painfully underfunded throughout its history, stunting the development and materials available to the school. The application of the registry gives this summation: \\"The Rock Run School served the African American community of Rock Run in rural Henry County, Virginia from the post-Civil War Reconstruction Period of the early 1880s through the mid-20th century. It is a highly significant vestige of the educational history of Southside Virginia, the rural south, and the black population of late 19th-mid-20th century Henry County. Although in overall poor condition, the school has not been altered over the years or damaged in any substantial way. As such, its historic integrity is remarkable, and its potential for restoration appears promising. It is a rare and irreplaceable surviving example of an educational institution that served African Americans, because it represents several phases in the evolution of African American education in Virginia.\\"National Register of Historic Places.

The Inr is the simplest functional promoter that is able to direct transcription initiation without a functional TATA box. It has the consensus sequence YYANWYY in humans. Similarly to the TATA box, the Inr element facilitates the binding of transcription Factor II D (TAF). The Inr works by enhancing binding affinity and strengthening the promoter. Overview The initiator element (Inr) is the most common sequence found at the transcription start site of eukaryotic genes. It is a 17 bp element. Inr in humans was first explained and sequenced by two MIT biologists, Stephen T. Smale and David Baltimore in 1989. Their research showed that Inr promoter is able to initiate basal transcription in absence of the TATA box. In the presence of a TATA box or other promoters, the Inr increases the efficiency of transcription by working alongside the promoters to bind RNA polymerase II. A gene with both types of promoters will have higher promoter binding strength, easier activation and higher levels of transcription activity. The TFIID, which is a component of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex binds to both the TATA box and Inr. Two subunits, TAF1 and TAF2, of the TFIID recognize the Inr sequence and bring the complex together. The interaction between TFIID and Inr is believed to be most imperative in initiating transcription. This is likey due to the Inr sequence overlapping the start site. The Inr element is also believed to interact with activator Sp1, specificity protein 1 transcription factor. Sp1 is then able to regulate the activation and initiation of transcription Location The Inr element sequence is located -6 bp upstream of the transcription start site and continues to around +45 bp downstream. This sequence encompasses where the RNA polymerase will begin transcribing. The Inr element is located about ~20 bp downstream from the TATA box. The Inr region overlaps the transcription start site but the exact start and end positions are still being debated. Sequence The consensus sequence of Inr in humans was inferred to be YYANWYY. The census sequence in Drosophila is TCAKTY. Evolutionary change Studies have shown that promoters with a functional Inr are more likely to lack a TATA box or to possess a degenerate TATA sequence. This is because a gene with an active Inr is less dependent on a functional TATA box or additional promoters. Although Inr element varies between promoters, the sequence is highly conserved between humans and yeast. An analysis of 7670 transcription start sites showed that roughly 40% had an exact match to the BBCA+1BW Inr sequence. While 16% contained only one mismatch TFIID and subunits are very sensitive to the Inr sequence and nucleotide changes have been shown to drastically change the binding affinity. The +1 and -3 positions have been identified as the most critical for transcription efficiency and Inr function. A replacement of the Adenosine nucleotide at the +1 to G or T changes transcription activity by 10% and a replacement of Thymine at the +3 position changes transcription activity levels by 22%. Significance The Inr element for core promoters was found to be more prevalent than the TATA box in eukaryotic promoter domains. In a study of 1800+ distinct human promoter sequences it was found that 49% contain the Inr element while 21.8% contain the TATA box. Out of those sequences with the TATA box, 62% contained the Inr element as well. Though the Inr element is not fully understood it has been recognized as the most frequently occurring sequence at the start site of genes in multiple species. Further research can allow for more understanding of the elements that regulate gene production. Notes In nucleic acid notation for DNA, K stands for G/T (Keto)  References  2\\\\.

He died of a heart attack in October 2002 at the age of 17 while preparing for a parade of retired New York bred horses at Belmont Park and was buried in Clare Court at Saratoga Race Course. Background Fourstardave was a chestnut gelding with a white stripe on his forehead. He was bred in New York by Richard Bomze. His sire was Compliance, a son of Northern Dancer out of Sex Appeal, and thus a full brother to champions El Gran Senor and Try My Best. Compliance was himself winless in only three starts, but his breeding made Bomze buy him from Windfields Farm as a stallion prospect. Fourstardave's dam was Broadway Joan, a daughter of obscure stallion Bold Arian. Bomze purchased her for only $2,500, but when mated with Compliance, Broadway Joan produced an impressive string of winners that earned her the title of New York Broodmare of the Year three times. Fourstardave was her second foal; Fourstars Allstar, the first American-based horse to win a European classic, was her fourth. Fourstardave was trained by Leo O'Brien. Because of his obscure breeding and \\"tough\\" temperament, he was gelded as a youngster and had a long racing career. According to O'Brien, \\"He loves racing. He comes off the farm every spring ready to run. He's never really had an injury. He never sulks. He always gives you a good race. You bet $2 on him, you get a run for your money.\\" He was sometimes almost claustrophobic in the stable though, so O'Brien cut a window in the side of his stall so Fourstardave could look at his brother Fourstars Allstar. \\"No kidding\\", said O'Brien. \\"We even put their feed tubs next to the window so they can eat side by side.\\" Racing career Fourstardave was one of the most popular horses of his time, racing from age 2 to 10. Fans called him \\"The Sultan of Saratoga\\" because he won at least one race at Saratoga Race Course each year from 1987 to 1994. Bomze said, \\"I'll never forget Tom Durkin's calls of Dave's races as he was breaking his own record year after year. Everyone was rooting for him, and Tom's calls would bring the crowd to a crescendo. I would go to Saratoga and look up in the stands and tell my wife, 'You know something, honey, there are a few thousand people here who have a heck of a lot more money than I do, but, boy, they'd give their right arm to have a horse like we've got.'\\" Fourstardave ran mostly at Belmont Park and Saratoga, but also finished in the money at Laurel, Finger Lakes, Monmouth Park, the Meadowlands, Rockingham Park, Philadelphia Park, Calder, and Canterbury Downs. The Saratoga win streak started on August 28, 1987 when Fourstardave won the 6-furlong Empire Stakes for New-York bred two-year-olds. That year, Fourstardave earned three wins in nine starts, with five seconds. The only time he finished out of the money was in the grade 1 Young America Stakes at the Meadowlands. His first graded stakes win was in 1988 at Canterbury Downs in the St Paul Derby. That year, he also won the Albany Stakes at Saratoga. Fourstardave raced 13 times as a three-year-old, with two wins, one second, and six thirds. In 1989, Fourstardave raced 14 times, with wins in an overnight handicap and the Poker Stakes at Belmont Park, and the West Point Handicap at Saratoga. He also finished second in the Daryl's Joy Stakes and fourth in the Bernard Baruch Handicap at Saratoga. At age 5 in 1990, he raced 14 times, winning four times. The highlights were wins in the Daryl's Joy at Saratoga and the Jaipur Stakes at Belmont. In 1991, Fourstardave repeated his victory in the Daryl's Joy and also won the West Point Handicap, both at Saratoga. In the 1991 Daryl's Joy, Fourstardave ran miles in an exceptional 1:38.91, setting a turf course record that would stand until 2015. He was named the 1991 New York-bred Horse of the Year. In 1992, Fourstardave ran thirteen times with only two wins in allowance races, one at Belmont and the other at Saratoga. At the age of eight in 1993, 'Dave' started thirteen times, with wins in the Neshaminy Handicap at Philadelphia Park, the Poker Stakes at Belmont and an overnight handicap at Saratoga. He also finished second in the Daryl's Joy to Lure, two-time winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf and was controversially disqualified from winning the West Point Handicap. Fourstardave was invited to race in the Group 1 Hong Kong International Bowl at Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong on December 12 at . He would finish twelfth. On July 24, 1994, Fourstardave won an allowance race at Saratoga by five lengths, keeping his streak from 1987 alive. He then started in the Bernard Baruch Handicap on August 12, in which he finished third behind Lure and eventual champion grass male Paradise Creek. His connections believe he would have won if he had not stepped in a hole while leading the race at the top of the stretch, injuring his ankle. X-Rays taken the next day revealed a hairline fracture. Fourstardave would miss the rest of the year and was never the same, finishing no better than fourth in his six starts at age 10. On August 27, 1995, he was retired. O'Brien said, \\"He's given us everything, more than a million horses could have given us. I would have loved to see him go out with a win with everybody cheering for him. But I know how bad I would have felt had he run worse than last time.\\" Fourstardave retired having made 100 starts with a record of 21 wins, 18 second-place finishes and 16 times in third. His total earnings were $1,636,737, which at the time made him the third highest earning New York-bred in history. On the turf he was at his best, winning 15 races and almost $1 million. Retirement Upon his retirement, Fourstardave was honored at Siro's Restaurant in Saratoga, where he was presented with an edible key to the city. A small lane was named \\"Fourstardave Way\\" in his honor. Starting in 1996, O'Brien brought Fourstardave back to Saratoga for \\"a well-earned vacation\\", where he would jog each morning but otherwise relax. Each year, O'Brien would walk Fourstardave to the Canfield Casino in Congress Park for the annual Fourstardave Party to raise money for the Belmont Child Care Association. In 1997 (at the age of 12) Fourstardave was entered in the High Hope Steeplechase at the Kentucky Horse Park, an amateur event for charity, and finished second. When not otherwise engaged, Fourstardave spent his final years at Another Episode Farm near Ocala, Florida. An active horse, Fourstardave was galloped by the owner of the farm every day. Fourstardave died on October 14, 2002 at the age of 17 after having been shipped to Belmont Park to take part in a parade of retired New York-breds on New York Showcase Day. Taken out onto the track in early morning to do light training, he had a heart attack while jogging around the track. Honors and Recognition In 1996, the Daryl's Joy Stakes, which he won twice, was renamed in his honour. Fourstardave led the post parade for the 1996 renewal and later joined the winner, Da Hoss, in the winner's circle. The Fourstardave is now a Grade 1 event. After his death in 2002, Fourstardave was buried in Clare Court at Saratoga Race Course, one of only three horses to be so honored. On August 11, 2013, fans at Saratoga were given a commemorative Fourstardave bobblehead figure. After a fan poll in 2015, a new sports bar at Saratoga was named the Fourstardave. Pedigree Fourstardave was inbred 4S x 5D to Nearco, meaning Nearco appears once in the fourth generation on the sire's side of Fourstardave's pedigree and once in the fifth generation of the dam's side.

Located just outside today's Martinsville, Virginia, the plantation thrived in tobacco production and textile manufacturing, as well as producing household goods and raising livestock. At one point the enslaved blacks of Beaver Creek were tending a thousand yam plants; in one day they made 660 candles. History Beaver Creek was built in 1776 under the ownership of George Hairston, son of Robert Hairston and Ruth Stovall Hairston, on a 30,000-plus acre royal land grant initially purchased from Col. Abram Penn. The original house was destroyed by fire in 1837 and was rebuilt while owned by George Hairston's son Marshall, whose profile according to family legend was incised on a window of the home when he was struck by lightning. The house was rebuilt using virgin oak from nearby Henry County forests.Beaver Creek Plantation, hairston.org Much of the plantation's rich slave history remains intact, and stories of unusual slaves are well documented and accessible. Often noted is the tale of Sam Lion,A street in nearby Martinsville, Sam Lions Trail, is named for the slave Sam Lion. a field hand on the plantation. Over the years, Lion had earned enough extra money to buy his own woodworking tools. However, when a new overseer asked to borrow one of the tools, Lion refused. The overseer attacked him, and Lion killed the man with a shovel he was using to chop kindling. Lion fled the plantation, and hid in a nearby forest for two months. Eventually, unwilling to go North without his family, Lion turned himself in. He was sentenced to hang, and was shot while trying to escape. Like Lion, other slaves were able to earn small amounts of money outside of their daily duties. Ned and Clem, two wagon masters, earned money by hauling extra loads for other planters. Clem was also a beekeeper, and amassed enough savings to buy his own honey press, which cost $10 and two gallons of honey. Although slave rebellions were typically few, Beaver Creek was almost home to such an uprising. In 1812, a slave named Tom murdered a neighbor of George Hairston's plantation. Through his confession, Hairston discovered a plot to poison himself and neighboring slaveholders, a rebellion that would have been disguised by an expected British attack in the area. Hairston Plantation, Lowndes County, Mississippi, home of George W. Hairston, c. 1909. Part of the empire of Hairston homes and plantations scattered about the South The Hairston family, who had Beaver Creek built, eventually came to control tens of thousands of acres of land in Virginia, North Carolina and elsewhere across the South. Initially planters of tobacco, the family eventually became the largest slaveholders in the South: the engine of their extraordinary wealth (they were said to be one of the wealthiest families in America) was the propagation of slaves for export to the Deep South. The family married into other prominent local families, including several intermarriages with the descendants of General Joseph Martin, for whom Martinsville is named. George Hairston, who married his cousin Matilda Martin, daughter of Col. William Martin and Susan (Hairston) Martin, represented the district in Congress.History of Patrick and Henry Counties, Virginia, Virginia G. Pedigo, Lewis Gravely Pedigo, Clearfield, 1990 The Hairston family descends from Peter Hairston, who left Scotland for America, initially locating in Pennsylvania and eventually moving south to Virginia in the 1740s.Hairston, Men of Mark in Virginia, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Vol. IV, Men of Mark Publishing Co., Washington, D.C. 1908The Hairston name is of Scottish origin but has apparently died out today in Scotland. Hordsville, built while owned by 1836 by George Hairston, Henry County, Virginia Ultimately, the fallout from the Civil War, chiefly the emancipation of slaves, put an end to the Hairston's booming business and the family's fortunes dwindled. At the center of the Plantation is the Hairston's classical revival mansion. Although the plantation was founded in 1776, the present house was not built until 1837, to replace the original home destroyed in a fire. Today, the house is owned by Bank Services of Virginia, and the home and gardens are usually open to the public during the Historic Garden Week in Virginia.

House overview The Pierce Street House was built in 1903, by Edward Spencer and the surrounding area includes a large garden and a one-room retreat called Edankraal, where Spencer did much of her writing. The word \\"Edankraal\\" is a combination of \\"Edward,\\" \\"Anne,\\" and \\"kraal,\\" the Afrikaans word for enclosure or corral. The house is a two-story modified Queen Anne style, shingle residence. Its two-bay facade is divided equally between a recessed section, covered with a hipped roof, and a slightly projecting gable-roofed bay to the right. On the first floor, one can find a living room, dining room, sunroom, front hall, and kitchen. The second floor includes four bedrooms, a full bath, and a sunroom. The third floor, which is not generally open to the public, was originally a \\"man cave\\" for Edward featuring a pool table and half bath, but later became another area for the Spencer's grandchildren. The front hall of the house reveals themes central to Anne Spencer's life. The use of color and mirrors bring the outside in, creating a garden of light and colors on the interior of the Spencer home. Edward's innovations are evident even in this small space‚Äîthere's a phone booth tucked under the staircase, arched doorways, leading into the front hall and leading into the living room. Crown molding graces the ceiling and doorways. Fountain in the gardens at the Anne Spencer House museum in Lynchburg, Virginia. The house was modified periodically as the family grew and their social lives expanded. Edward creatively recycled used materials, incorporating windows, doors, handrails, or other cast-off materials into useful components for his home. A screened porch was eventually enclosed as a cozy den, and the lattice from the porch was re-used to make an entry into the garden. Guggenheimer's Department Store in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia had no more use for some sheets of copper that were in a window display. Edward used the copper to cover, shape, and enhance the recessed paneling below the chair rail of the dining room. Bright, red leather, padded doors, originally part of the all-black Harrison Movie Theater on Fifth Street in Lynchburg, Virginia, were re-used in the kitchen and led to a side porch. Massive, oversized banister stair railings were salvaged and re-used in the attic ‚Äúdormitory room‚Äù Edward re-furbished for the visiting grandchildren in later years. He also installed a second bathroom there, which is modestly screened only with a simple hand-drawn curtain. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is located in the Pierce Street Historic District. Spencer in Lynchburg Anne Spencer was the first Virginian and first African-American to have her poetry included in the Norton Anthology of American Poetry. She was also a committed activist for equal rights, and her house also served as a political center of the community.

They were active from 1995 to 2001, and again from 2007 on. Career  In late 1995, Joe Sib after the breakup of his band Wax, decided to get together with longtime friend Steve Soto (former member of The Adolescents and Agent Orange) to write some material. They started writing songs and soon noticed that something special was taking place. They soon gathered Sandy Hansen (The Adolescents), Scott Shiflett (Face to Face), and Jason Cropper (Weezer) to form 22 Jacks. In February 1996, 22 Jacks went to The Sandbox studio in Los Angeles and recorded 12 songs which became the \\"Uncle Bob\\" record. With the three final additions to the band already having prior commitments, Sib and Soto went on a search for replacements to solidify the lineup. They found Kelly LeMieux (Fear), Jose Medeles (The Breeders, and Face to Face), and Bill Fraenza. Before a fourth album could be recorded, 22 Jacks called it quits around 2001 as Sib left the band to concentrate on the future of SideOneDummy Records. Following the breakup, Soto went on to reform The Adolescents and Medeles also joined the reunion of The Breeders as their new drummer. During its six-year lifespan 22 Jacks toured with numerous bands, including Reel Big Fish, Lit, The Bloodhound Gang, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Goldfinger, Social Distortion, Bouncing Souls, Unwritten Law, Face to Face, Voodoo Glow Skulls, and Ten Foot Pole. They also sang back up for Joey Ramone on a song for a Cheap Trick Tribute album. This helped spark a friendship that lead to Joey Ramone showing up at 22 Jacks concerts and even singing a song or two with them. Reunion and Soto's death On December 13, 2007, Punkbands.com reported that 22 Jacks had reformed to play three shows in California in January 2008, making it their first performance together since breaking up in 2001. On one of the dates, they were supported by Social Distortion. It was also announced that there may be a follow-up to that tour. As of this moment, the band has not yet expressed plans for a new studio album. On June 27, 2018, founding member Steve Soto died suddenly in his sleep at the age of 54 just days after finishing a tour with his band The Adolescents.

She became famous during the 1990s when she and her sister Aleksandra Kovaƒç were a big attraction in Serbia and surrounding countries ‚Äì R&B; band K2. She got back in the spotlight in 2007, thanks to her hit-single \\"Kolena\\" which spent more than 15 weeks at No. 1 on Serbian pop-rock charts and also entered MTV Adria Top 20. She was one of the judges on the first series of X Factor Adria. Biography Kristina Kovaƒç was born in Belgrade, Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia in 1974. She is the daughter of the prominent Serbian composer Kornelije Kovaƒç. Kristina travelled a lot while she was a child and also lived in many places in Europe, such as London. She worked in London for the management company Mismanagement until the second half of the 1990s. In 2019 Kristina moved to Stockholm, Sweden with her family. Soon after in 2020, she started selling furniture from her Belgrade apartment on Twitter. Her online sale went viral in the Serbian Twitter community, making memes out of the high prices she was asking for a decade old furniture. Some of the things for sale included IKEA shelves, a couch and a microwave. Career=Popularity and stardom Kristina become popular with the group K2 where she performed along with her sister Aleksandra. They have released four albums. In 1989, under their father's guidance, using the name Next of kin the girls recorded an English language album Way to the top in Spain. The album was also released in their home country in 1990, but failed to make much of a splash without proper media support. In 1991, the duo sang back vocals for Bebi Dol who represented Yugoslavia at the 1991 Eurovision Song Contest. They moved to London in September 1991 to support Labi Siffre on tour. Towards the end of the year they came back to Belgrade, before departing for Norway in the summer of 1992 where, under the name You dirty sisters they recorded promo material for the composer Sway. The year 1993 brought another trip to England where the sisters performed in various London clubs such as Mean Fiddler, The Orange and Tea Room des Artistes. After hearing them perform in Mean Fiddler in 1993, Errol Brown (the former singer of Hot Chocolate) booked Aleksandra and Kristina as an opening act and as backing vocals on his tour. For this occasion they performed as The Cornelias. With this, K2 got positive reactions from major records labels ‚Äì Sony, Polydor and Warner Bros.. In the next five years, Aleksandra and Kristina worked with many important names from the music industry, such as Derek Bramble (composer and producer, worked with Whitney Houston, Nona Gaye) and the composing duo Rod Argent-Peter Van Hooke (composed and produced for Genesis, Tanita Tikaram). Their first album Ajmo u zivot released for Komuna Belgrade in 1995 was very popular and the girls became famous. They released a few videos ‚Äì such as Ajmo u zivot, Dzangl manija, Milo moje. All of them were No. 1 on Serbian pop-rock charts. Only a year later the girls started making new material for their second album. The second album, called Malo soula was released in late 1996 and still had No. 1 singles. The girls also did several videos ‚Äì Dabadamdam, Sestre, Bicu tvoja devojka. In 1997 Komuna Belgrade, their label released a compilation album Time out which contained 2 new K2 songs and some other songs by other Serbian hip hop artists. A video for Srebro i zlato was released and became one of the group's biggest hits. Due to being the biggest Serbian attraction, K2 released an album in Spain in Spanish for EMI in 1998. The debut Spanish album was named just K2 and was successful. It contained Spanish versions of their previous songs. For example, their No. 1 hit Dabadamdam became Debedamdam, Sestre became Hermanas, Ajmo u zivot became Vamos de fiesta etc. The same year the remix album called Vamos de fiesta ‚Äì Remixes was also released for EMI. Hiatus, break, split up In 1997, they released a compilation with Serbian hip hop artists, which also included two new K2 songs: \\"Srebro i zlato\\", and \\"Da li zna≈°\\". A video for Srebro i zlato was also released. In later days, turbo folk music got more attention in Serbia, so the girls split up and started doing solo projects. Behind the scenes Kristina started focusing mainly on composing. She composed melodies for many advertisements, and also formed the boy band Peti element in 2001 which was quite popular in those days. She also wrote music for many famous singers ‚Äì from Tanja Banjanin to Karolina Goƒçeva. But, in 2005 she did the music for the movie Mi nismo anƒëeli 2 which was the biggest movie of 2005 in Serbia. She also sang one song ≈†ta se dobije kad se dva anƒëela klade but it was not released as a single nor got any media attention. Those days she also performed the song Pesma za kraj and also made a video‚Äîit's one of her most important songs. Some journalists wondered if that song was meant for K2, although it was clear that it was finally a solo Kristina Kovaƒç song. Going solo Kovaƒç started working on her debut album in the summer of 2006. The album was called U Nebranom Gro≈æƒëu and KK Production released it in the summer of 2007. The album contains ten songs. All songs were produced and written by her. The album features the Croatian band Cubismo, and Vinnie Colaiuta (drums, played with Sting, Eros Ramazzoti, Anastacia, Pussycat Dolls), Dominic Miller (guitar, Sting‚Äôs \\"right hand\\") and Paul Turner (bass for Jamiroquai and Annie Lennox) also did some instrument playing on the album. Her first single was \\"Kolena\\", the biggest summer hit of 2007 in Serbia. It was a Latin pop song and featured Cubismo. The single spent nine weeks at No.1. \\"Kolena\\" reached the MTV Adria Top 20. The second single was \\"Zivot je ljut\\", which is Kovaƒç's favourite song off the album, according to her. The video and the song are about love and heartbreak. Kovaƒç's fans were also able to take part in the making of \\"Zivot je ljut\\" video. The second single also reached MTV Adria Top 20, and was more successful on the chart than the previous single, \\"Kolena\\". The video gained popularity and won awards, such as the award for the best video on Beovizija 2009 and Suncane skale festivals. Kristina chose \\"Milica i ja\\" as the third single and made an unofficial statement on her official forum that her fans would be able to be in the video too. But, Kovaƒç got pregnant during late 2007, and the release and filming of the video was scrapped. Kristina stated that she would \\"not film a video for Milica i ja\\" and that she will do a video for Ko instead, a fan and critic favourite. The video was not filmed, and Kovaƒç gave birth to a girl called Tara on 1 July 2008. Her pregnancy remained almost publicly unnoticed, since Kristina did not want to make it \\"a public thing\\". After giving birth, Kovaƒç started to work on the organisation of her first concert in Belgrade and also continued to work on the story of the Ko video.

Her parents divorced when she was a teenager. She then moved to Miami with her mother where they had family and attended North Miami High School. After high school, at the age of 16, she moved back to New York City and worked as a receptionist for the Max Richards Theatrical agency which acted as an employment agency for actors. Work After a year working as a receptionist, a family friend got her a job as a publicist at Mo Braveman Associates that represented nightclubs, singers, performers; she later went to work for Dorothy Ross Associates which represented Broadway shows. She credits her publicist background with learning how to write on demand. She moved to Los Angeles in the late 1960s after Henry Rogers approached her and her husband Michael Gershman (who was also a publicist) and asked them to start a music department for Rogers & Cowan particularly in representing Rock bands. She had to step down from the role because she became pregnant with her daughter. In 1972, Corday joined and worked as a publicist for the anti-war organization Another Mother for Peace where she met its founder, Barbara Avedon who was also a new mom. Avedon got their foot in the door with their projects because she had prior experience working on TV series like The Donna Reed Show, Father Knows Best, The Danny Thomas Show, The Ann Sothern Show, Margie, Gidget, Medical Center and That Girl. Danny Arnold hired them to write a script for a Barbara Eden pilot (which never went to development). They worked so well together, they officially became writing partners. From 1972 to 1979, they wrote several episodes for television series and a few pilots as free-lance writers including 19 episodes of Fish, 4 episodes of Sons and Daughters, Executive Suite, Wonder Woman, Maude, and Turnabout (where they met Sharon Gless). In 1974, they started working on Cagney and Lacey and tried to sell the script but were unsuccessful despite having support from Ed Feldman, executive in charge of film development at Filmways and from Sherry Lansing at MGM. After giving up writing, Corday worked at several networks and made a career as top executive. In 1979, she dissolved her writing partnership with Barbara Avedon but they would team up again for a short time in 1981.

She took a position developing comedies for ABC in 1979 developing the comedies Bosom Buddies and Reggie. Over the next ten years, she moved up the executive ladder. In 1981, the script for Cagney and Lacey was finally accepted by CBS who made a movie followed by a TV series which aired from 1982 to 1988. In 1984, Columbia exec, Herman Rush, recommended that she take over his position as a president of Columbia Pictures which made her the first female senior executive at Coca-Cola which then owned Columbia Pictures. In 1987, she was named president and chief operating officer of Columbia/Embassy Television, a now defunct division of Coca-Cola Television that produced TV series and TV movies. In 1988, Larry Tisch and Howard Stringer hired her as executive vice president of Primetime Programming at CBS Entertainment; she left in 1990 after her boss, network entertainment president Kim LeMasters resigned in 1990. In 1992, Corday returned to CBS programming as co-executive producer of the popular prime-time television series Knots Landing and from 1993 to 1994, she served as president of New World Television.

It was released on November 5, 2008 for Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade. Isopod Labs was formed by three former members of Luxoflux, developer of the original Vigilante 8 series. A remake of Vigilante 8 with some elements of Vigilante 8: Second Offense included, Vigilante 8: Arcade features online play for up to eight players. Vigilante 8: Arcade received mixed reviews. Reviewers were divided; multiple reviewers felt the game was a good fit for Xbox Live, with one reviewer calling it \\"a glorious throwback to a simpler age in gaming.\\" Others praised the game's online multiplayer component and the game's salvage upgrade system. Some reviewers, however, felt that the vehicle physics were poor. Gameplay Vigilante 8 Arcade is a remake of Vigilante 8, with some influences from its sequel, Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense. Vigilante 8: Arcade is a vehicular combat game in which vehicles are outfitted with weaponry to combat opponents. Each vehicle is equipped with machine guns and one special attack that is unique to that vehicle. Weapon powerups are littered throughout each map and can range from heat seeking missiles to mines. Each can be fired in a total of four ways, the weapon's standard operation and via three specialized, more powerful attacks unique to that weapon. The game uses a salvage point upgrade system similar to Vigilante 8: Second Offense, meaning that vehicles can be upgraded by picking up salvage point icons dropped by enemies. V8 Arcade features four single player game modes. In Quest mode, players choose a character and play through the game from that character's perspective, learning about the character's background as the game progresses. In Quick Battle players are given and random vehicle to combat against random enemies until the player is either dead or victorious. Custom Battle is similar, but allows the players to choose both the characters and the arena to play in. Free Wheelin' is a mode with no AI that allows the players to drive around the environment, searching for secrets and learning the layout. Multiplayer can be played with up to four players via splitscreen, Xbox Live or in any combination of the two. It features two modes, Deathmatch, which pits all players against each other, and Team Co-Op, where all human players work together against AI opponents. The game includes five levels, each inspired by original Vigilante 8 and Vigilante 8: Second Offense levels, but with modified layouts. Some of the game's levels are inspired by multiple levels from the previous games, melded together to create a new environment. Two additional levels are available via downloadable content. The first, Stunt Track, is a circular track that has ramps, loops and other daredevil-esque hazards. The second, Garage, is an oversized level set in a giant garage, making vehicles the size of an RC car. Synopsis V8 Arcade is built around an alternate history, in which there was a serious worldwide oil crisis in the 1970s. The United States was on the verge of economic breakdown, with crime, strikes and riots rampant. All available law enforcement were called to the major cities, which left the countryside and outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), sought to monopolize the world oil trade. OMAR hired professional terrorist Sid Burn to wreak havoc and destroy the US economy. Sid organized a group of terrorists to help him with his task. Calling themselves the Coyotes, they began to destroy oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industries throughout the southwestern United States. With law enforcement all in the cities, civilians began to take the law into their own hands. A trucker known as Convoy organized a group to fight against the Coyotes, taking the name of the Vigilantes. As conditions continued to deteriorate the US government focused all its research and development to that of new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, based on alien technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. Word of the facility was leaked to Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed Site-4. As Sid and his gang packed up the weaponry the Vigilantes unexpectedly arrived to stop them. As a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry. Characters Eight characters are available at the start of the game, similar to the original Vigilante 8, each with five different colors to choose from. There is also one unlockable character, and downloadable content featuring more characters. Once a character has completed the story mode, the original Vigilante 8 vehicle model from Vigilante 8 will be unlocked, playable in all game modes. Development and marketing Vigilante 8 Arcade was announced on February 14, 2008. The game's developer, Isopod Labs, consists of three key individuals responsible for much of the production of the original Vigilante 8. The studio consisted of just six individuals and a small number of art contractors, and the title's development was self-funded. Isopod Labs originally looked to a June 2008 release; however, the game was not originally submitted for Xbox Live certification until August 12, 2008. Testers found issues on Microsoft's end in relation to the QNet code library. The issue was resolved by both parties and the game was sent back to Microsoft for resubmission. \\"We certainly wish it was a quicker process,\\" said Isopod Labs, \\"but this is how the cookie crumbles ‚Äî not much else to do, but wait.\\" In a post-release interview with Joystiq Isopod Labs' Adrian Stephens added \\"The certification issue is a tricky one and more could be done to smooth the path towards certification.\\" Vigilante 8 Arcade passed Microsoft's Xbox Live certification on September 24, 2008, and was released November 5, 2008. Although the cars are mostly based on the original Vigilante 8, the soundtrack is a remixed version of the music from Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense. V8 Arcade supports the Xbox Live Vision camera, allowing players to see their opponents face to face. Developers Isopod Labs also converted the original cars from Vigilante 8 as unlockable bonus content. J3Concepts also created a custom theme for the original blades Xbox 360 dashboard. A downloadable content addon known as the High Octane pack was released on Xbox Live marketplace on December 3, 2008. It features three new characters and two new levels. Reception Vigilante 8 Arcade received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers generally remarked on the game's multiplayer as its strong point. Official Xbox Magazine UK reviewer Ryan King called V8 Arcade \\"a glorious throwback to a simpler age in gaming.\\" He further applauded the game's online multiplayer, stating that it was some of the best that Xbox Live Arcade has to offer players. Cheat Code Central's Jason Lauritzen felt the game was nostalgic. Nate Ahearn of IGN welcomed the game's salvage gameplay mechanic while also praising the online multiplayer. Official Xbox Magazines Mitch Dyer also commented on the strong multiplayer, and added positive remarks on the amount of weaponry and number of firing modes per weapon. TeamXbox's Tom Price noted the game's \\"big levels, tons of weapon pickups, and crazy opponents\\" calling them \\"simple and effective.\\" Reviewer Andrew Hayward of 1UP.com stated the game's predecessors \\"built a solid foundation for taking the series online\\" adding that the game as fun when \\"pounding mortar shots and missiles at some unfortunate foe from afar.\\" Critics were disappointed in the poor controls, gameplay glitches, and game camera issues. OXM's Dyer commented that the game had \\"crummy controls\\" and a poor camera. Reviewer Austin Light of GameSpot also cited poor controls, physics, and gameplay glitches. Eurogamers Dan Whitehead felt the controls were weak in comparison to the original Vigilante 8. He further felt the game did not meet up to its potential. 1UP.coms Hayward further agreed with Whitehead, stating \\"sadly [...] most of Vigilante 8: Arcade's issues are technical in nature.\\" Vigilante 8 Arcade sold over 60,000 copies as of June 2010. Though reviews of the game had been mixed, some reviewers cited its relatively inexpensive 800 Microsoft Point cost as a selling point.

White spots are also present. Their tails begin red and change to yellow at the ends. Their bellies are mostly blue, but the centers are black. This subspecies can be found in southern Mpumalanga, a province of South Africa. P. i. wilhelmi may not be a subspecies of Platysaurus intermedius, as it possibly is closer to the Lebombo flat lizard, Platysaurus lebomboensis. Males have been found to run shorter distances and go into hiding from a predator earlier than females. P. i. rhodesianus P.i.rhodesianus is one of the largest subspecies of the common flat lizard, reaching 120 mm in length. A male can either have a blue-green or a yellow- green head. The head also has three white stripes. The back color is dependent on range. For the majority of its range, the front part of its back is blue- green. The only exception is in Mozambique, where the front part is red. In the eastern part of its range, the lower part of its back is green, and in the western part of its range, the lower part of its back is red. Tails can be either greenish or yellowish, like many other Platysaurus species. Two phases for the neck and chest can occur. The first phase has a blue throat, a black collar, and a mud-colored chest. The second phase has a yellow throat, black collar, and a green or blue chest. This race occurs in all of Zimbabwe except the northeast, eastern Botswana, and the Limpopo. P. i. nigrescens P.i. nigrescens is 7.5‚Äì9 cm long. The male has a black head, chin, throat, chest, and belly. Yellow scales are scattered across this lizard's body. The tail is bright orange. This subspecies occurs near the Shoshong Hills, in northeastern Botswana. P. i. subniger P. i. subniger is similar in size to P. i. rhodesianus. The male of this subspecies has a dark green back which becomes brown or black in the rear of the back, with whitish spots. In males from Trelawney, Zimbabwe, their backs are uniform red, also with whitish spots. The tail and throat are orange (though the throat can also be yellow or white), while the chest and belly are black. A female specimen lived 3.1 years in captivity. P. i. parvus P. i. parvus is 65‚Äì75 mm long. The males has a dark green back in the anterior, but the posterior part is red-brown. The back can also have whitish spots, similar to many other Platysaurus species. The tail is a dark orange, while the throat is pale blue. The neck has two black spots on either side. This is a reduced collar. The chest and belly are blue, similar to others of the genus. This race can be found on Blouberg, a mountain, in Limpopo Province. P. i. natalensis P. i. natalansis occurs in Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal, a province of South Africa. The back is dark green, with white spots and stripes. The tail is orange. The throat is yellow or pale blue, with black spots and a black collar. The chest and belly are two different shades of blue. P. i. intermedius P. i. intermedius is 85‚Äì90 mm long, and was the first subspecies to be found. Their heads and bodies are green or brown, along with nearly nonexistent spots and stripes. The tails are either red or yellow. Their throats and bellies are blue, as are many other males in this species. This subspecies is found around Pietersburg, North Province. P. i. inopinus P. i. inopinus males are similar to P. i. parvus in appearance and size. Two major differences are white thighs with black spotting and a lack of a reduced collar. P. i. inopinus can be found in the foothills of Blouberg, Northern Cape in South Africa. P. i. nyasae P. i. nyasae occurs in Malawi and central Mozambique. They were discovered in 1953.

As a fruit of his hard labour, the party put its faith in him for contesting the Assembly polls against BJP's sitting Guardian Minister, Jagdish Gupta. Deshmukh won the polls by almost 10,000 votes and wrested back the constituency for Congress. Vidhan Sabha elections, 2004 From 1999 to 2004, Deshmukh undertook developmental works of nearly Rs. 300 crores in his constituency.

Vidhan Sabha elections, 2009 Sunil Deshmukh with supporters during the Vidhan Sabha Election, 2009 In the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) elections of 2009 Deshmukh rebelled against his party, the Indian National Congress. Despite being a sitting member from Amravati for the previous two terms his claim to the Amravati seat was overlooked in favour of Raosaheb Shekhawat, the only son of then President of India, Pratibha Patil. It is alleged that Shekhawat got the ticket at behest of his mother, who lobbied strongly for his candidature, while Deshmukh was offered a ticket for the neighbouring Achalpur constituency. Deshmukh refused the offer, saying he could not seek a mandate from a constituency where he has not worked. He was also reportedly offered a Cabinet Ministry and membership of Legislative Council if he withdrew from race as an Independent. Deshmukh refused to withdraw, terming the contest as a fight between \\"an ordinary man of Amravati\\" and the combined might of \\"Rashtrapati Bhavan\\", state machinery and the Indian National Congress. In a closely contested fight, Deshmukh lost narrowly, polling 55,717 votes against Shekhawat's 61,331. Janvikas Congress Party and Amravati Municipal Corporation election, 2012 Having been expelled from the Indian National Congress due to his rebellion in the Vidhan Sabha election, 2009, Deshmukh formed his own political party called Janvikas Congress Party in December 2011. This was done keeping in mind the Amravati Municipal Corporation elections which were conducted in February 2012. His traditional supporters, including three former Mayors of Amravati, joined this party. Janvikas Congress won seven seats in the Amravati Municipal Corporation election. Vidhan Sabha Elections, 2014 Deshmukh on his way to file his nomination papers from Amravati during the Maharashtra Vidhansabha elections, 2014 In the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha Elections which were held on 15 October 2014, Deshmukh contested from Amravati constituency on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket.

Born in Clara, County Kilkenny, Prendergast first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1978 championship. Prendergast immediately became a regular member of the team and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Prendergast won one Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Clara. Throughout his career Prendergast made 26 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1987 championship. Prendergast has three sons - David, Neal and Shane. All three sons have won minor All Ireland medals for Kilkenny. Shane captained Kilkenny Senior hurling team in 2016. David has won two Dublin senior club county medals with UCD, a feat he often brags about to his friend Cathal Billings (St. Vincent's), who has none. Playing career=Colleges During his schooling at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Prendergast established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1975 he won a Leinster medal following a 6-12 to 4-3 defeat of Presentation College from Birr. On 20 April 1975 St. Kieran's faced Colaiste Iognaid Ris from Cork in the All-Ireland decider. A huge 6-9 to 2-3 victory gave Prendergast an All-Ireland medal. Club Prendergast enjoyed his first success with Clara in 1982. A 0-13 to 0-9 defeat of Carrickshock secured a championship medal in the intermediate grade. Four years later in 1986 Clara reached the senior decider where they faced reigning champions Ballyhale Shamrocks. The sides were level at half time but, in a nail-biting finish, a Joe Casey goal for Clara secured a narrow 3-10 to 4-5 victory. Minor and under-21 Prendergast first played for Kilkenny as a member of the minor team in 1975. A 2-18 to 3-4 defeat of Dublin secured a fifth successive provincial title for the team and a first Leinster medal for Prendergast. On 6 September 1975 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats proved much too strong and powered to a 3-19 to 1-14 victory, giving Prendergast an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Kilkenny retained their provincial dominance in 1976 with Prendergast collecting a second Leinster medal following 2-15 to 1-8 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 5 September 1976 saw Tipperary providing the opposition. Kilkenny were completely overwhelmed by the Tipp challenge and endured a 2-20 to 1-7 defeat. Prendergast was still only in his first season with the Kilkenny minors when he was added to the under-21 team in 1975. He was an unused substitute throughout the year, however, he did collect a set of Leinster and All-Ireland medals following Kilkenny's undefeated championship campaign. Two tears later in 1977 Prendergast won his first Leinster medal on the field of play as Wexford were downed on a score line of 3-11 to 1-10. Cork were once again waiting for Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. Having been beating the previous year, the Cats made no mistake on this occasion and secured a narrow 2-9 to 1-9 victory. It was Prendergast's first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. Senior Prendergats made his senior championship debut on 25 June 1978 in a 2-17 to 1-4 Leinster semi-final trouncing of Offaly. Kilkenny subsequently broke Wexford's stranglehold on Leinster and secured the provincial title with a narrow 2-16 to 1-16 victory. It was Prendergast's first Leinster medal at the highest level. On 3 September 1978 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider, as the Rebels were bidding to become the first team in over twenty years to secure a third championship in succession. The game was far from the classic that was expected, with the decisive score coming from Jimmy Barry-Murphy whose low shot towards goal deceived Noel Skehan and trickled over the line. The 1-15 to 2-8 score line resulted in defeat for Prendergast's side. Prendergast won a second successive Leinster medal in 1979 as Wexford were defeated by 2-21 to 2-17. On 2 September 1979 Kilkenny faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. Bad weather and an unofficial train drivers' strike resulted in the lowest attendance at a final in over twenty years. The bad weather also affected the hurling with Kilkenny scoring two freak goals as Galway 'keeper S√©amus Shinnors had a nightmare of a game. A Liam \\"Chunky\\" O‚ÄôBrien 70-yard free went all the way to the net in the first half, while with just three minutes remaining a 45-yard shot from Mick Brennan was helped by the wind and dipped under the crossbar. Kilkenny won by 2-12 to 1-8 with Prendergast winning his first All-Ireland medal. After a fallow two- year period, Kilkenny bounced back in 1982 with Prendergast winning his first National Hurling League medal following a 2-14 to 1-11 defeat of Wexford. He later added a third Leinster medal to his collection following a 1-11 to 0-12 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls and reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly. On 5 September 1982 Kilkenny and Cork renewed their rivalry in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats were rank outsiders on the day, however, a brilliant save by Noel Skehan was followed by two quick goals by Christy Heffernan just before the interval. √âamonn O'Donoghue pegged a goal back for Cork, however, Ger Fennelly added a third for Kilkenny who secured a 3-18 to 1-13 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Prendergast while his performance throughout the championship later earned him an All-Star. Prendergast won a second consecutive league medal in 1983 following a narrow 2-14 to 2-12 defeat of Limerick before later collecting a fourth Leinster medal as Offaly were accounted for by 1-17 to 0-13. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1983 was a replay of the previous year with Cork hoping to avenge that defeat. Billy Fitzpatrick was the star with ten points, giving Kilkenny a 2-14 to 1-9 lead with seventeen minutes left, however, they failed to score for the remainder of the game. A stunning comeback by Cork just fell short and Prendergast collected a third All-Ireland medal following a 2-14 to 2-12 victory. In 1986 Kilkenny bounced back with Prendergast collecting a third league medal following a 2-10 to 2-6 defeat of Galway. He later collected a fifth Leinster medal following a 4-10 to 1-11 defeat of reigning champions Offaly. Prendergast, who was now captain of the team, won a sixth and final Leinster medal in 1987 as Offaly were downed once again by 2-14 to 0-17. On 6 September 1987 Galway, a team who were hoping to avoid becoming the first team to lose three finals in-a-row, faced a Kilkenny team who for many of its players knew it would be their last chance to claim an All-Ireland medal. Galway 'keeper John Commins saved two goal chances from Ger Fennelly, while at the other end substitute Noel Lane bagged a decisive goal as Galway claimed a 1-12 to 0-9 victory. Inter-provincial Prendergast also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial championship, however, his career coincided with a low ebb for Leinster hurling at this level. His sole triumph came in 1979, when a 1-13 to 1-9 defeat of Connacht in the decider gave him a Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute.

It has also been published under the title \\"An Alien Agony\\".Aldiss, Brian (ed.)(1972): The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus. Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin Books, p. 321. It was first published in 1962, in Brian Aldiss's magazine New Worlds #122. The story has since been reprinted over 30 times in 14 languages, in anthologies and also academic textbooks. Science fiction critic Paul Tomlinson, who helps run Harrison's official website, has estimated that it is Harrison's most widely published story. Its name is a reference to a passage from the Biblical 2 Samuel 1:20, which says: \\"proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon\\". Harrison wrote the story for a Judith Merril-edited anthology, which was to contain original stories that all violated societal taboos in some way: Streets portrayed a heroic atheist and a naive, foolish missionary. When Merrill's project fell through, Harrison approached other markets; however, no American publisher accepted it, and so Harrison approached British markets instead. Streets was not published by an American company until six years later.The Streets of Ashkelon at HarryHarrison.com; retrieved August 8, 2007. Plot An atheist merchant/trader, John Garth, is the only human on an alien planet where the native Weskers, intelligent but painstakingly literal-minded amphibians, live in what seem to be utopian conditions. These Weskers have no concepts whatsoever of gods, nor religion, nor sin. Garth has been gradually teaching them the scientific method. One day Garth is surprised by the arrival of Father Mark, a missionary who is intent on proselytizing to the natives. Despite Garth's best efforts to dissuade him, even at gunpoint, the missionary is intent on \\"saving souls\\". Weeks pass, and Father Mark has been instructing the Weskers in catechism in their newly constructed church, and he has recently finished teaching the Weskers about the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. Soon afterwards, Itin, the ostensible leader of the Weskers, approaches Garth about the problem of reconciling the empirical truth of the scientific method with the symbolic truth of revealed religion and asks him to come to the church to debate Father Mark. Once at the church, Garth, who had previously made preparations to leave the planet, sees the Bible open to an illustration and orders the missionary to come with him. Not understanding what's wrong, Father Mark refuses; but before Garth can explain, several natives seize the priest and drag him to a hill, upon which is planted a cross. In accordance with what Garth taught them about the scientific method, they are experimentally testing the hypothesis that if they crucify the missionary in accordance with what he taught them about the Gospels, he will miraculously rise from the dead three days later and thereby redeem them. Three days later, after Father Mark has been buried and the hypothesis disproved, Itin asks Garth what went wrong and arrives at a simple truth: that the Weskers are now murderers. Critical response Paul Di Filippo considers \\"The Streets of Ashkelon\\" to be a response to James Blish's A Case of Conscience.Review of Harrison's 2001 anthology, 50 in 50 at SciFi.com (via archive.org). Paul Cook describes \\"The Streets of Ashkelon\\" as \\"bitterly ironic\\" and \\"one of the saddest science fiction stories ever written\\", saying that it \\"gives credence (of a kind) to the spirit of the Prime Directive\\".Fourth Lecture, from Paul Cook's official site at Arizona State University.

It presents an annual concert series in Boston and New York City, produces opera recordings, and organizes a weeklong Festival and Exhibition every two years in Boston. A centerpiece of these festivals has been a fully staged Baroque opera production. One of BEMF's main goals is to unearth lesser-known Baroque operas, which are then performed by the world's leading musicians armed with the latest information on period singing, orchestral performance, costuming, dance, and staging at each biennial Festival. BEMF operas are led by the BEMF Artistic Directors Paul O‚ÄôDette and Stephen Stubbs, BEMF Orchestra Director Robert Mealy, and BEMF Opera Director Gilbert Blin. In 2008, BEMF introduced its Chamber Opera Series as part of its annual concert season. The series presents semi-staged productions of chamber operas composed during the Baroque period. In 2011, BEMF took its chamber production of Handel's Acis and Galatea on a four-city North-American tour. In 2004, BEMF initiated a project to record some of its work in the field of Baroque opera on the CPO recording label. The series has since earned five Grammy Award nominations, including a 2015 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. At each Festival, concerts are presented every day from morning until late at night. Concerts are given by an array of established luminaries and rising stars in the field of early music worldwide. BEMF concerts also allow for unique, once-in-a-lifetime collaborations and programs by the spectacular array of talent assembled for the Festival week's events. In addition, there are many scheduled Fringe concerts and events, presented both by local and out-of-town groups at a number of venues in Boston and Cambridge. The Exhibition at the Festival is the largest event of its kind in the United States, showcasing over one hundred early instrument makers, music publishers, service organizations, schools and universities, and associated colleagues. In 1989, BEMF established an annual concert series to meet the increasing demand for year-round performances of early music. BEMF then expanded its concert series in 2006, when it began presenting performances to New York City at The Morgan Library & Museum. BEMF's annual season now sets the bar nationally for early music performance and has featured such musicians as The Tallis Scholars, Jordi Savall and Hesp√®rion XXI, and Les Arts Florissants, as well as the North American d√©buts of Stile Antico, Bach Collegium Japan, Netherlands Bach Society, and Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Berlin.

It was built in 1936 to serve as a factory for The Campana Company, which produced Italian Balm, the most popular hand lotion in the United States during The Great Depression. The Streamline Moderne and Bauhaus building features many innovative technologies, such as air conditioning. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The Campana Company was a manufacturer of hand lotion, most notably Italian Balm, and other beauty products. Despite the economic hardships of The Great Depression, Campana was prosperous due to an aggressive radio advertising campaign featuring commercials on several hit shows, including The First Nighter Program. Campana also advertised by mailing millions of free samples to potential customers. The company was successful enough to warrant a new factory in 1936. The factory was intended to use the latest technologies and architectural styles to promote its products. The entrance to the Campana factory. The Bauhaus and Art Deco inspired building was three stories tall with a central tower rising . The building is in a long, horizontal block, and the third story is half as long as the other two. The floors alternate between tile and glass brick with no mullions. The glass bricks provide interior lightning in lieu of full windows. Horizontal bands of turquoise tile stretch around the building, with vertical bands rising up the tower. The Campana logo is written in gold leaf above the main entrance and in a large, red neon sign near the top of the tower. Inside, fluorescent lights provide lighting to areas not nearby glass brick. Most walls are painted white or are tiled. The east side of the building was used as a visitors' gallery, where Campana executives could give tours of the building and its product without disturbing the workers. The manufacturing floor was visible through large plate glass windows from this wing. The interior of the tower housed a water tank for fire protection and air conditioning. The frieze in the lobby featured Art Deco depictions of nudes. The building was one of the first to be completely air conditioned. As a consequence, operational windows were considered unnecessary and were never added. Its automated assembly lines and mechanical mixers were considered to be state-of-the-art technologies. Cosmetic ingredients were dropped from the third floor to the second floor to be mixed. The company also moved its administrative offices in the building. Desks were established in rows to maximize space, a new idea at the time, but now one of the most common methods of desk arrangement. A glass block wing was added to each end of the first floor in the 1940s and is the only major addition since the plant opened. The Campana Company was purchased by Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan in the early sixties which allowed it to function as a separate unit. Because Campana's president, I. Willard Crull, was asked to briefly serve as Dow's interim president, he was afforded time to shop around Campana so that it would be kept intact by its future owner. California headquartered Purex subsequently bought Campana in the mid sixties, made Crull its vice president for health-care products and toiletries.\\"a, b, c...\\" The Standard & Poor Directory of Corporations and Executives, Volumes 1965-77.

The crematory is located at 3211 Sublette Avenue in St. Louis, just across from the State Mental Hospital off of Arsenal Street. Now called \\"Valhalla's Hillcrest Abbey\\" it is owned by the Zell Family, who also own the Valhalla Chapel and Memorial Park on St. Charles Rock Road.  Establishment  In 1885, an informal association of cremation advocates was formed, and for several months, meetings were held in various places and the idea of building a facility and apparatus for performing cremations in St. Louis was discussed thoroughly. More precise action followed and, in July, 1887, the Missouri Crematory Association was organized and incorporated with a capital stock of $10,000. When enough money had been raised, a plot of land was purchased on Sublette Avenue, just south of Arsenal Street, near the State Mental Hospital. Prior to the completion of the crematory, those desiring cremation had to have their remains transported to Lancaster, Pennsylvania for this process to be done. Many of those who supported and desired this method for themselves had to be buried, as there was not a local crematory and their family did not want to incur the expense and stress of traveling to Lancaster.  The First Families of Cremation - Cremation's Pioneers in St. Louis = The Albert Todd & John Terry Families  One of the earliest pioneers of the Cremation Movement in St. Louis was Albert Todd, who was regarded by many as being one of the earliest supporters of cremation in the west. His advocacy of cremation created much of the support and sentiment that existed in St. Louis in its favor. Before his death in 1885, he had witnessed this sentiment grow so much that a cremation society was formed and a Crematory projected. Unfortunately, he did not live to see the Crematory's completion. He did, however, request that his body be held after death until the Crematory could be completed. His body was held in a vault for a full year after his death ‚Äì and the completion of the Crematory was not yet nigh. Thus, his remains were buried, uncremated, in the family plot at Bellefontaine Cemetery. All of the members of Mr. Todd's family followed in his footsteps and had become \\"Cremationists\\" ‚Äì supporters and advocates of this method of disposing of the dead. His daughter, Elizabeth Todd Terry, wife of noted St. Louis attorney John Terry, especially regarded this method as \\"the only proper one.\\" However, she was also unable to see the Crematory come to fruition ‚Äì she died at midnight on April 14, 1888. With the completion of the Crematory on the horizon, her remains were held in the private vault of George A. Lynch, a local undertaker, following Funeral Services held at her home on April 15, officiated by Rev. John Snyder of the Church of the Messiah.  The Otto Wilhelmi and Christopher Stifel Families  Otto J. Wilhelmi, a native of Franklin county, Missouri, was raised and educated in Missouri and later pursued his studies at Washington University and abroad at Polytechnic, Karlsruhe, Germany, in France and Italy. Upon the completion of his studies he became an architect of national reputation. For a time he was the architect for the St. Louis public schools and several of the most beautiful and attractive school buildings of the city stand as monuments to his skill and handiwork. A founder and originator of the Missouri Crematory Association, he served as Secretary of the Association from its inception until his death in 1925, and designed both the Crematory and Columbarium Buildings. November 23, 1882, he married Amelia Stifel, daughter of Christopher A. Stifel, who was also on the Board of the Crematory Association.  The Inauguration of the Missouri Crematory  Although Mrs. Terry's was the inaugural cremation at the new facility, Mr. Terry requested that as few persons be present as possible, other than the immediate relatives. So it was that the only persons besides the family that were present that day were Charles Speck, Judge J. G. Normile, and from the Crematory Association, John M. Dutro (Vice President), E. P. Olshausen and Dr. Henry S. Chase (Directors), Otto J. Wilhelmi (Secretary), and the attendants who were necessary to the actual work of the incineration. The Undertaker arrived in his carriage at the Missouri Crematory at approximately 9:00 a.m. with Mrs. Todd's casketed body. The family was then assembled in the Chapel on the upper level of the building, and the casket was lowered to the cremation room below. Following the cremation, Mrs. Todd's ashes were placed in a lead casket provided by the Undertaker, and were subsequently buried alongside her father in the family plot at Bellefontaine Cemetery.  Design & Construction  The Crematory, whose work and construction began in August 1887, was completed in May 1888. The Missouri Crematory is Doric in design. A square building which measures approximately forty feet deep, thirty-six wide, and twenty-six high, it was designed by Otto Wilhelmi, a prominent citizen and Architect in St. Louis who also served as the secretary of the Missouri Crematory Association from its inception until his death in 1925. In January 1889, the crematory took fire through some fault in the cremation apparatus. The building was almost totally destroyed by the fire but immediately work began on reconstruction of the facility, and a new, fireproof edifice was completed in a matter of months. Although the building that stands today is not the original, it is identical in size and style as its predecessor.  The Chapel of the Missouri Crematory  A Chapel, at one time an example of the grandest of any of its use, composes the entire upper level of the building. The floors and ceiling are covered with intricate mosaic marble tile-work, and the walls are frescoed. Fourteen stained glass windows provide the space with natural lighting, and later, a drop-ceiling was added and fluorescent lights installed to light the area. At the far end of the Chapel, opposite the entry doors, stands a small platform, two steps above the floor level. Three of the stained glass windows are above this area, and one on the left and right side walls. Above the three windows, in the arch of the ceiling, is a relief of the Alpha and Omega symbol. In the center of the platform is a catafalque, raised about three feet above the floor ‚Äì which serves as a lowering device. Upon arrival of the remains at the Crematory Chapel, the pallbearers carried the casket or coffin into the Chapel and it was placed on the catafalque and covered with a black drape which reached to the floor. The casket or coffin was thence concealed from the view of those in attendance while it was quietly and discreetly lowered by hand-pulley to the crematory room below. This chapel was used frequently while crematory operations were still performed at the Missouri Crematory, but when a new chapel was built on the grounds as part of a mausoleum addition, funeral and memorial ceremonies were held in the new chapel rather than the one that had served for so many years. Since then, the chapel has sadly fallen in disrepair ‚Äì and like the crematory apparatus, it is no longer necessary for it to be kept up.  The Cremation Apparatus and the Process of Cremation  Originally, two retorts were in use by the Missouri Crematory. Of the \\"Venini\\" pattern, they were invented by one Giuseppe Venini, who personally came from Italy to the Crematory to oversee their construction and installation. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the following dissertation of the crematory apparatus, reporting the day Mrs. Terry's remains were cremated: > \\"The furnace is a cylinder about three feet in diameter and five feet long. > It has grate bars at the bottom and an under draft. Above it is a hopper > into which wood is placed, a panel is withdrawn and the wood falls into the > cylinder. A fire is started in this cylinder in the usual manner, and it is > kept up until the furnace has attained the heat of from 1,200 to 1,400¬∞F. > The principal object is to heat the furnace, but the surplus heat is > conducted into the oven or retort where the body is to be incinerated. > Having gotten the furnace to the required heat the lower door is put up and > hermetically sealed with fire clay. Wood is then put into the furnace > through the hopper until it is quite full, when the top is also tightly > closed. The heated furnace distills the wood, and the gas generated passes > into the retort. The fire was started yesterday an hour and a half before > the incineration was to begin. When the gas was ready it was lighted in the > retort, and instantly the place was filled with a glow of orange flame. The > retort was somewhat heated by the preliminary fire but when the gas began to > combust, the temperature rapidly rose to the required 2,200¬∞F.\\" After the casketed body had been lowered to the crematory room, it was taken to the \\"Preparing\\" room, which stood adjacent to the \\"Incinerating\\" room. In this room, the body was removed from the casket or coffin and was wrapped in an alum-saturated sheet. The alum-treated sheet prevented the clothing and the body itself from immediately igniting when placed in the furnace. Thus, it allowed proper placement of the remains in the cremation chamber, and allowed the opening of the retort to be sealed properly for maximum combustion. After the body was wrapped in the alum-treated sheet, it was placed in an iron cradle-like device and conveyed by hoist into the cremation vault or retort. At this time, the process of incineration was begun. By a process of slow combustion and distillation, a gas was generated from ignited wood in another area of the apparatus (as explained by the Post-Dispatch, above), and this, with an admixture of air, was conducted into the retort in the form of a clear, bright flame at an extremely high temperature. Again, the Post-Dispatch spoke of the scene within the cremation vault through a portal in the door of the furnace: > \\"There is an opening in the door of the retort about two inches in diameter, > through which the process can be seen. As the decomposition advances the > crumbling form is seen, and that is all. The orange flame plays all about > the retort, the gases from the body burn, adding other colors to the fiery > scene. Soon as the gases cease to arise from the body, the flame is > extinguished, and only the Bunsen burners which had been lighted to consume > the noxious gases are left burning. These burners are three. Two are set in > the points in the retort where there are openings which lead into the > chimney. They consist of two pipes, one within the other. The inner pipe > contains wood gas, the other pipe contains atmospheric air conducted from > outside the building. The flame from these burners consumes all the gases > that would escape from the body during incineration, and what gases may > escape into the chimney unburned are there met by another Bunsen burner > which consumes them.\\" The \\"Venini\\" pattern afforded the means of consuming all smoke made, as well as all gases formed during the process of incineration. Therefore, at no time could anything, by sight or by smell, be detected issuing from the chimney. There were later designs in use by the Crematory, as stated below. In a mid-1950s brochure entitled My Heart Grew Rich That Day, which was given out by the Crematory Association, the current process of cremation was described as follows: > \\"In the beginning, Cremation and its procedure was unquestionably crude and > lacked all the refinements of later methods. Today the body is not removed > from the casket and both are placed in the crematory chamber, where super- > heated chambers leave no ashes, but instead pieces of the limestone bone > structure. These are the cremated remains to be placed in a Memorial Urn.\\" It is unknown at present writing, how often the retorts' methods of operation changed or the number of which were employed over time. While there are two retorts in place at the Crematory, they are not currently utilized. All licenses are purported to be kept current, and the retorts are supposedly kept in working order and ready for use, if needed. At present, any requests for cremation received at the Missouri Crematory are fulfilled by its parent company, The Valhalla Chapel of Memories on St. Charles Rock Road, also in St. Louis. The two retorts that are in place are fueled by gas and were placed in 1982. In the operation of these furnaces, the deceased was not removed from the casket, and none of the methods previously discussed were employed. Rather, the casketed body was placed directly in the retort, the ash from the casket pulled away by fan ‚Äì and the body reduced to bone fragments by intense heat and flame ‚Äì the heat and flame acquired by the ignition of natural gas.  The Columbarium = History  In the mid-1890s, the Crematory Association came to the agreement to design and build a Columbarium for the reception of the cremated remains of those cremated in its facility.  Design & Construction  Building commenced in July, 1895 of a design drawn up by Mr. Wilhelmi, architect and secretary of the Crematory Association, and was subsequently completed in December of that same year. The St. Louis Post- Dispatch carried an announcement describing the new Columbarium in the November 14, 1897 edition of their publication: > \\"The Missouri Crematory Association has erected a Columbarium for the > reception of urns containing the ashes of the dead. It is designed in the > Ionic style, is built of granite, iron and Roman bricks and is strictly > fireproof. It is located on the Crematory grounds at Sublette Avenue and > Arsenal street. The building is imposing in appearance and looks to be as > substantial as solid rock. In designing the building the association was > even at a greater loss for precedent than when designing the crematory. The > officials finally concluded to carry but their own idea, which is at > variance with the plans of the four other existing Columbaria at Long > Island, San Francisco, Gotha, and Berlin, and succeeded in erecting the most > beautiful and appropriate building of its kind in the world. Absolute safety > is guaranteed to all classes, but provisions have been made to make the > building accessible to families of moderate means, as well as the wealthy.\\" '' The Columbarium's Ionic design forms a handsome complement to its Doric companion in the Crematory building. The original structure was a simple, rectangular building with a deep, half-circle alcove at the back. Ornate bronze doors adorn most of the niches ‚Äì with the remainder of the niches being equipped with painted glass or marble fronts. The niches in the half-circle alcove were once equipped with clear glass doors that allowed the viewing of the urns within. Now, they've been painted over to form a uniform, gold- colored surface. In the center of the alcove of this original building, an ornate, semi-spiral walnut staircase descends to the basement. Originally, the entire lower level was equipped with \\"japanned metal shelves\\" to generally store or stack urns. Now, the entire basement (save the areas reserved for men's and women's rest rooms and storage ‚Äì accessed from the exterior of the building) is equipped floor-to-ceiling with marble-fronted niches. A continuation of the half-circle alcove on the upper level is behind the staircase. In 1919, an addition was added onto the west end of the original building. It is a large, rectangular space that is fitted wall-to-wall with marble-fronted niches. In the mid-1950s, a center \\"island\\" was added in this west end addition ‚Äì this \\"island\\" is equipped with clear glass- and bronze- fronted niches. A drop-ceiling has been installed in the columbarium building, thus eliminating many of the ornate architectural features of the interior. In the course of the addition of the drop-ceiling, all of the skylights and windows that once were used to provide natural lighting to the interior, have been covered, and electric fluorescent lights have been installed. Four columns are used for the support of the ceilings and are the only remainder of the architectural accents. At the base of each of these columns, save one, sits a large, decorative marble urn. These urns originally sat in the four niches in the Chapel of the Crematory building but were moved to the columbarium upon cessation of the use of the Chapel. These urns contain the ashes of four individuals, and they now serve as beautiful focal points for the Columbarium. One of the most impressive aspects of the Columbarium building is that throughout its interior, niches line all walls, floor-to- ceiling, so that there are no areas that are put to waste.

In probability theory and statistics Chow‚ÄìLiu tree is an efficient method for constructing a second-order product approximation of a joint probability distribution, first described in a paper by . The goals of such a decomposition, as with such Bayesian networks in general, may be either data compression or inference. The Chow‚ÄìLiu representation The Chow‚ÄìLiu method describes a joint probability distribution P(X_{1},X_{2},\\\\ldots,X_{n}) as a product of second-order conditional and marginal distributions. For example, the six-dimensional distribution P(X_{1},X_{2},X_{3},X_{4},X_{5},X_{6}) might be approximated as : P^{\\\\prime }(X_{1},X_{2},X_{3},X_{4},X_{5},X_{6})=P(X_{6}X_{5})P(X_{5}X_{4})P(X_{4}X_{3})P(X_{3}X_{2})P(X_{2}X_{1})P(X_{1}) where each new term in the product introduces just one new variable, and the product can be represented as a first-order dependency tree, as shown in the figure. The Chow‚ÄìLiu algorithm (below) determines which conditional probabilities are to be used in the product approximation. In general, unless there are no third-order or higher-order interactions, the Chow‚ÄìLiu approximation is indeed an approximation, and cannot capture the complete structure of the original distribution. provides a modern analysis of the Chow‚ÄìLiu tree as a Bayesian network. The Chow‚ÄìLiu algorithm Chow and Liu show how to select second-order terms for the product approximation so that, among all such second-order approximations (first-order dependency trees), the constructed approximation P^{\\\\prime} has the minimum Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence to the actual distribution P, and is thus the closest approximation in the classical information-theoretic sense. The Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence between a second-order product approximation and the actual distribution is shown to be : D(P\\\\parallel P^{\\\\prime })=-\\\\sum I(X_{i};X_{j(i)})+\\\\sum H(X_{i})-H(X_{1},X_{2},\\\\ldots ,X_{n}) where I(X_{i};X_{j(i)}) is the mutual information between variable X_{i} and its parent X_{j(i)} and H(X_{1},X_{2},\\\\ldots ,X_{n}) is the joint entropy of variable set {X_{1},X_{2},\\\\ldots ,X_{n}}. Since the terms \\\\sum H(X_{i}) and H(X_{1},X_{2},\\\\ldots ,X_{n}) are independent of the dependency ordering in the tree, only the sum of the pairwise mutual informations, \\\\sum I(X_{i};X_{j(i)}), determines the quality of the approximation. Thus, if every branch (edge) on the tree is given a weight corresponding to the mutual information between the variables at its vertices, then the tree which provides the optimal second-order approximation to the target distribution is just the maximum-weight tree. The equation above also highlights the role of the dependencies in the approximation: When no dependencies exist, and the first term in the equation is absent, we have only an approximation based on first-order marginals, and the distance between the approximation and the true distribution is due to the redundancies that are not accounted for when the variables are treated as independent. As we specify second-order dependencies, we begin to capture some of that structure and reduce the distance between the two distributions. Chow and Liu provide a simple algorithm for constructing the optimal tree; at each stage of the procedure the algorithm simply adds the maximum mutual information pair to the tree. See the original paper, , for full details. A more efficient tree construction algorithm for the common case of sparse data was outlined in . Chow and Wagner proved in a later paper that the learning of the Chow‚ÄìLiu tree is consistent given samples (or observations) drawn i.i.d. from a tree-structured distribution. In other words, the probability of learning an incorrect tree decays to zero as the number of samples tends to infinity. The main idea in the proof is the continuity of the mutual information in the pairwise marginal distribution. Recently, the exponential rate of convergence of the error probability was provided.A Large-Deviation Analysis for the Maximum-Likelihood Learning of Tree Structures. V. Y. F. Tan, A. Anandkumar, L. Tong and A. Willsky. In the International symposium on information theory (ISIT), July 2009. Variations on Chow‚ÄìLiu trees The obvious problem which occurs when the actual distribution is not in fact a second-order dependency tree can still in some cases be addressed by fusing or aggregating together densely connected subsets of variables to obtain a \\"large-node\\" Chow‚ÄìLiu tree , or by extending the idea of greedy maximum branch weight selection to non-tree (multiple parent) structures . (Similar techniques of variable substitution and construction are common in the Bayes network literature, e.g., for dealing with loops. See .) Generalizations of the Chow‚ÄìLiu tree are the so-called t-cherry junction trees. It is proved that the t-cherry junction trees provide a better or at least as good approximation for a discrete multivariate probability distribution as the Chow‚ÄìLiu tree gives. For the third order t-cherry junction tree see , for the kth-order t-cherry junction tree see . The second order t-cherry junction tree is in fact the Chow‚ÄìLiu tree.

A radar speed sign is an interactive sign, generally constructed of a series of LEDs, that displays vehicle speed as motorists approach. The purpose of radar speed signs is to slow cars down by making drivers aware when they are driving at speeds above the posted limits. They are used as a traffic calming device in addition to or instead of physical devices such as speed bumps and rumble strips. The devices have been referred to by a wide variety of names, a partial list of which follows: driver feedback sign, radar signs, Vehicle Activated Sign (UK), changeable message sign, Your Speed sign, radar feedback sign, speed radar sign, radar speed display, speed feedback sign, traffic calming sign, speed display board, dynamic speed display (DSDS) or variable message sign. Usage Radar speed signs are often used in school zones, sometimes in conjunction with Safe Routes to School programs, in construction zones, or on busy residential roads. Some college and corporate campuses use radar speed signs to slow traffic as well. Many plants are using these signs to monitor forklifts and other type trucks. There are steps to placing a radar speed sign. Speed display signs are sometimes used in conjunction with physical traffic calming solutions. They are also used on streets that cities do not want to put physical measures on either because of snow concerns or traffic volume. Often, cities will use these signs to test streets to determine the need for further traffic calming. Features and types Signs are available in a range of costs with a variety of different features. Manufacturers of radar speed signs abound, ranging in style and features from a basic inexpensive sign to more sophisticated signs with myriad features to help analyze data and improve results. Pole mounted signs that combine speed display with variable message capability are often used in school zones, eliminating the trailer's \\"footprint\\". Standard signs have stationary block letters that display the words \\"your speed\\". More advanced models include variable messages such as Your Speed, Speed Limit, and Slow Down, which can be programmed based on motorist speed. Many manufacturers offer optional solar power, which allows the signs to be powered via solar energy with rechargeable batteries included for nighttime operation. Many users (especially in Northern climates) have reported problems with solar powered signs failing to work during winter months, and with their internal batteries failing prematurely. However, newer proprietary power efficient methods are available as well as cold weather batteries. Some of the features offered on the higher end signs include focused viewing systems to avoid distractions for motorists in other lanes, vehicle data collection, programmable software that allows you to determine sign behavior, and/or access via portable devices such as Bluetooth or PDAs. Many signs offer tampering and vandalism prevention measures built into the signs, such as Lexan and BashPlates. Some signs offer a flashing light to warn motorists who exceed a designated speed. However, many state, county and city traffic engineers in the USA specify only signs that meet the federal guidelines called MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) which, due to safety reasons, eliminate certain distracting features like strobe lights and certain color messages. A Vermont state guideline is very specific and eliminates many features.Sign Guidelines See more about MUTCD below. Effectiveness Studies conducted both in the UK and in the US have found radar speed signs to effectively slow traffic down. Although the overall speed reductions are generally less than those resulting from physical measures, the signs have the greatest effect on those drivers that are exceeding the posted speed, or traveling within speed transition zones. One sample study undertaken along speed transition zones in Shelburne, Vermont measured vehicle speeds at three locations before and after the installation of radar speed signs, and found reductions in 85th percentile speed ranging from 3 to 8 mph. http://acrpc.org/transportation/ Another study conducted in Bellevue, Washington found that various types of radar speed signs installed in thirty- one locations resulted in 85th percentile speed reductions generally ranging from about 2-6 mph, with a few exceptions; Where four locations measured a reduction of less than 1 mph, and one other location had actually increased by 0.3 mph. However, another location had measured the maximum reduction of 6.8 mph. In spite of the small average speed reduction, the city considers the signs to be successful because they have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the speed of those vehicles that were traveling in excess of the limit, while not interfering with the progress of the majority of traffic that is already traveling at or below the speed limit. The signs were most effective on streets where vehicles were driving more than 10 mph above the posted speed limit. In the Bellevue study, streets where signs were installed continued to experience speed reductions even two years after the signs were installed.Permanent Radar Signs Other Agency Experience A radar speed sign (below a \\"Speed Limit 35\\" sign) in Los Angeles, California. The radar sign reads \\"36\\" U.S. federal standards The MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices), a standards document issued by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), has specified standards regarding sign size and letter height for Speed Limit Signs (an R2-1 in the parlance) under Section 2B.13. This is the only section of the current revision of the MUTCD to mention the use of a radar speed sign and refers to them as ‚Äúchangeable message signs‚Äù, a term normally associated with work zone safety and the like. Subsequent the release of the 2009 edition of the MUTCD, an official interpretation regarding the use of radar speed feedback signs cited (in Section 2L.04) that \\"changeable message signs shall not include advertising, animation, rapid flashing, dissolving, exploding, scrolling, or other dynamic elements\\" to enhance the conspicuity of highway signs. Section 2B.13 (excerpt) ‚ÄúA changeable message sign that changes the speed limit for traffic and ambient conditions may be installed provided that the appropriate speed limit is shown at the proper times. A changeable message sign that displays to approaching drivers the speed at which they are traveling may be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit sign. Guidance: If a changeable message sign displaying approach speeds is installed, the legend YOUR SPEED XX km/h (MPH) or such similar legend should be shown. The color of the changeable message legend should be a yellow legend on a black background or the reverse of these colors.‚Äù The first paragraph allows for the use of VSL Signs (Variable Speed Limit signs), the second for use of a Speed Feedback Sign. The third is ‚ÄúGuidance‚Äù, not regulation, concerning the content and color of the ‚Äúlegend‚Äù, typically the static signage surrounding the electronic display. Two other states have been much more specific in their directive regarding Speed Feedback Signs, California and Minnesota. California‚Äôs most recent comments were somewhat more specific as to what they expected. In it they expressed specifics regarding color of the numerals, some technical specifics regarding the LEDs used and expressly prohibit the signs from being used for any VSL purpose, which several signs on the market do. They also call for a White on Black plaque rarely if ever found in the market. White on black is usually reserved for night time speed limit signs. In addition the document offers guidance on character shape, eschewing the common 7-segment style for a more graphic character resembling the fonts (D or E Series Highway Fonts) used on R2-1 signs. ‚ÄúCalifornia MUTCD Page 2B-13 (FHWA‚Äôs MUTCD 2003 Revision 1, as amended for use in California) Vehicle Speed Feedback Signs Option: A Vehicle Speed Feedback sign that displays to approaching drivers the speed at which they are traveling may be installed in conjunction with a Speed Limit (R2-1) sign. Standard: If a Vehicle Speed Feedback sign displaying approach speeds is installed, the legend shall be YOUR SPEED XX. The numerals displaying the speed shall be white, yellow, yellow-green or amber color on black background. When activated, lights shall be steady-burn conforming to the provisions of CVC Sections 21466 and 21466.5. Vehicle Speed Feedback signs shall not alternatively be operated as variable speed limit signs. Guidance: To the degree practical, numerals for displaying approach speeds should be similar font and size as numerals on the corresponding Speed Limit (R2-1) sign. Option: When used, the Vehicle Speed Feedback sign may be mounted on either a separate support or on the same support as the Speed Limit (R2-1) sign. In lieu of lights, legend may be retro-reflective film for flip-disk systems. The legend YOUR SPEED may be white on black plaque located above the changeable speed display. Support: Driver comprehension may improve when the Vehicle Speed Feedback Sign is mounted on the same support below the Speed Limit (R2-1) sign. Vehicle Speed Feedback Signs are appropriate for use with advisory speed signs and with temporary signs in temporary traffic control zones.‚Äù In Minnesota‚Äôs case their Department of Transportation got very specific.Technical Memorandum No. 13-01-T-01 dated Jan. 2, 2013 Too exhaustive to repeat here, it nevertheless addresses specific static sign color based on application, flash rates and activation speeds for violator alerts etc. In addition, a Minimum Product Specification is attached to the document. It is widely believed in the industry that the new revision of the Federal MUTCD will much more specifically address these devices and will most likely grandfather in non-compliant existing signs for some reasonable period of time.

Established in 1967, the PHPA is one of the oldest players' unions in professional sports and the only minor league Players' Association within a major league sport. Recognized by the US National Labor Relations Board as the certified bargaining unit for all members enrolled in the Association, the main function of the PHPA is to negotiate and protect various player benefits by way of a Collective Bargaining Agreement. These benefits include: health and welfare benefits, training camp allowances, travel and trade relocation expenses, per diem, housing allowances, play-off shares, licensing rights, revenue-sharing, and membership assistance programs. History The Professional Hockey Player's Association was founded in 1967 in Portland, Oregon, when members of the Portland Buckaroos (of the now defunct Western Hockey League (WHL)) recognized that Canadians playing hockey in the United States who were starting families would send their wives home to Canada to give birth to their babies. Canada's social insurance system would cover the expense for Canadian citizens in Canada, but the teams provided no coverage usable in the U.S. A number of Portland Buckaroos, including Doug Messier, Arlo Goodwin, and teammates, led the group and hired Portland attorney Curt Leichner as their legal counsel to legally form a WHL Players Association to allow WHL players to take advantage of group pension and health care plans, gaining better benefits through strength in numbers. Over the course of the 1967‚Äì68 season, players from the American Hockey League saw the benefit of forming a ‚Äúbenevolent society‚Äù of their own and approached their WHL counterparts with the vision of creating one players' association which would represent all professional hockey players outside of the National Hockey League (NHL). On May 20, 1968, WHL and AHL players voted to form the ‚ÄúProfessional Hockey Players‚Äô Association\\". After the 1973‚Äì74 season, former WHL President Max McNab became the fourth President of the Central Hockey League (CHL), a developmental league for professional minor league hockey players, which featured some teams that were affiliates for various NHL clubs. With a number of former WHL executives at the helm of the CHL, players were eager to organize a collective voice and become members of the PHPA. A small group of elected CHL player representatives was invited to the PHPA‚Äôs annual meeting of player representatives to discuss the application to the PHPA among player representatives from the WHL and AHL. On May 17, 1974, a motion was passed whereby the CHL players' application for membership into the PHPA was accepted. CHL players were represented by the PHPA until 1984, when the league folded. The WHL folded in 1974, citing financial pressures resulting from the WHL‚Äôs prime venues being taken by the expansion practices of the NHL and World Hockey Association (WHA). The PHPA remained healthy as it still represented players in two leagues, the AHL and CHL. In 1985, players in the former International Hockey League (1945‚Äì2001) (IHL) petitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to join the PHPA. IHL owners accepted the PHPA as the recognized bargaining unit for IHL players without the need for a formal NLRB vote. In 1991, Larry Landon was asked by the PHPA Executive Committee to succeed Curt Leichner, who was preparing for retirement, as the new Executive Director. Landon assumed the role of Deputy Executive Director until 1993, when he officially assumed control of the PHPA. Landon then moved the PHPA office from Portland, Oregon, to St. Catharines, Ontario. In 1994, a group of players from the East Coast Hockey League approached Landon about being represented by the PHPA. At the 1994 PHPA Annual Meeting of Player Representatives, AHL and IHL player representatives unanimously approved the effort to unionize the ECHL, and during the 1994-95 season, PHPA staff initiated efforts to represent ECHL players. Eventually, on March 17, 1995, the NLRB conducted a formal, secret ballot vote among players in each ECHL city. The result was an overwhelming response from the players in favor of unionizing the ECHL, with the first PHPA-ECHL CBA finalized in October 1995. By 2000, the AHL had a dramatically different look, as almost half of its twenty teams were new, and attendance had almost doubled since 1994. The IHL meanwhile, suffering from significant contraction and challenges in many of its markets, folded in 2001. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, players in the Central Hockey League (CHL) approached the PHPA with interest in PHPA representation of CHL players. On April 1, 2008, the NLRB recognized the PHPA as the official bargaining unit for CHL players, after a secret-ballot vote conducted by the NLRB. The league and PHPA reached an inaugural CBA in October 2009, which was retained until the CHL and ECHL consolidated in 2014. In 2010, the PHPA relocated its headquarters to Niagara Falls, Ontario. Currently, the PHPA represents approximately 1,600 players across 58 teams throughout the AHL and ECHL, which are the premier player development leagues for the NHL. Organization The PHPA‚Äôs management is led by Executive Director Larry Landon, who heads an Executive Committee of player representatives from the AHL and ECHL. For every five teams in a league, one player representative may be added to the Executive Committee. The Committee assists the Executive Director in providing direction and oversight in dealing with various matter of importance to the Association and its membership, including budgetary matters, player issues, strategic planning, and other business affairs.

Florida. Sink.‚Äù Punknews.org also praised the album and made many similar observations. They called the record \\"the type of record that most young bands wish they could create to launch their musical career.\\" Unplugged reviews noted that \\"The Gaslight Anthem blend anthemic punk-rock spirit with Springsteen-influenced storytelling (together with a folk influence that recalls early Against Me!) to create a compelling, addictive whole.\\" They also expressed appreciation for Fallon's \\"gruff vocals\\" and the contrast between up-tempo rockers like \\"We Came to Dance\\" and \\"Red in the Morning\\" and acoustic folk numbers like \\"The Navesink Banks\\" and \\"Red at Night.\\" Release In December 2010, the album was re- released in Europe exclusively on vinyl.

It is in the newly created District of Chikballapur, in the taluk (township) of Chikballapur. Kandavara is north of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), the silicon plateau of India. Downtown Chikballapur is north of Kandavara, separated by a reservoir locally known as Kandavara Amanikere, and paddy fields downstream from the reservoir. The north-south State Highway SH-74 runs at the foot of the reservoir on the east side of the reservoir. State Highway SH-74 abuts Kandavara on the west side, and links Kandavara to Chikballapur in the north and the village of Nandi in the south. The former north-south National Highway NH 7, also known as Bangalore-Bellary Road or BB Road, is about east of Kandavara connected by an east-west rural partially paved road. The current NH-7 bypasses all the built up areas of Chikballapur and is located east of the city including Kandavara. According to the 2001 Census, the population of Kandavara was approximately 4,000. Some estimates in January 2007 put the figure at 4.400. Tourist attractions Kandavara is the home of the Heritage Primary School where Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya,India's engineer statesman and Divan of the former princely state of Mysore, did his primary schooling. The classes he attended were in the U-shaped school building built in 1845. A native son of the village, Mr. Narayana Swamy Katari, also attended the same school and went on to retire as the Chief Secretary of the State of Karnataka in 1967. The Heritage Primary School was refurbished in 2006 by the Dwaraknath Reddy Ramanarpanam Trust (DRRT) under the leadership of Ms Anita Reddy. The restored building is fully functional. One classroom has been made into an interpretive centre. Settlement Profile Fifty five kilo-meters north of Bangalore (or Bengaluru), lies Kandavara‚Äîa rustic village population four thousand. Kandavara city is now considered a distinct neighbourhood of the town of Chikballapur two kilo-meters to its north. Legally Kandavara is Ward 14 of the City Municipal Council Chikballapur. The built form of Kandavara appears like a hat from the air. Google Maps has done an excellent job of presenting the Greater Chikballapur Area including Kandavara. Approximately 10000 people of Kandavara, i.e., nearly 80% of the population of Kandavara consist of dalits. The built up area of Kandavara is 7.37 square kilo-meters and is surrounded by agricultural land. It has eight temples and one mosque. Kandavara has a Heritage Primary School with classes from 1st through the 7th standard located in two buildings. The first one, a U-shaped one, was built in 1845 and the second one, a block structure, was built in 1895. The 1895 building is in a very poor condition and requires extensive rehabilitation although it is being used for classroom purposes. The Primary Health Centre (PHC) building that was at the south-western edge of Kandavara was demolished in 2009. The State of Karnataka has built a fair sized Nursing School on the 1.5 acre site. At present the School is fully functional. In 2012 January, the not-for-profit organization, Canadia Trust, opened the polyclinic CHERE (Canadia Health, Education, and Rural Empowerment). The polyclinic is fully functional at present. The well-known Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences located in the Whitefield neighbourhood of Bangalore sends a team of 10 health specialists every third Saturday of the month to provide advanced health care. The polyclinic serves the needy in Kandavara and surrounding villages. Kandavara has no sanitary sewer system. It has no solid waste disposal system. Sanitary sewers and storm sewers consist of open stone lined gutters. Water is secured through two functioning deep wells that pump water to a fair sized water tank to households have piped water supply. The water from the two wells is used for cooking and drinking and is adequate for all other purposes. Majority of households have electricity but are subject to the chronic blackouts that is endemic to India. Cable television service is available. Mobile telephone reception is excellent.

The series follows a mysterious teenage boy of unknown origin who is taken in by a family from Seattle, and his attempts to solve the puzzles of who he is and why he has no memory. Main characters *Kyle Trager (Matt Dallas) is the protagonist, a teenage boy with no bellybutton and no memory of who he is. His strange case is referred to Nicole Trager, a therapist who takes him home. Kyle must learn to do everyday things like eat and drink, speak, and avoid hurting himself. Season one follows Kyle as he learns about how people live, but nothing of who he is. Season two explains Kyle's existence, and he begins to discover his purpose. Kyle also discovers, in season 2, that he was created by scientists as an experiment. Throughout the show Kyle has encounters with scientific communities that know of his \\"special abilities\\" like Zzyzx, MadaCorp, and Latnok. His experiment name is \\"781227\\" or \\"XY\\". He is romantically interested in Amanda Bloom and then Jessi. *Nicole Trager (Marguerite MacIntyre) is a psychologist who is assigned Kyle as a patient and decides to take him in as foster child. She is married to Stephen Trager, and has two other children: an older daughter named Lori and a son named Josh. Nicole is Kyle's main source of support and his moral anchor throughout the series. *Stephen Trager (Bruce Thomas) is Nicole's husband. He is a well-paid software designer who directs a programming team. Stephen and Nicole are happily married and supportive of the kids. *Lori Trager (April Matson) is the teenage daughter of Stephen and Nicole, as well as the older sister of Josh and Kyle. Lori sneaks out to date Declan and gets drunk at parties. She loves Declan, but they have something of an on and off romance, but in the third season she starts dating her father's TA, Mark. Lori confides in her best friend, Hillary. *Josh Trager (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) is the son of Nicole and Stephen Trager, and the younger brother of Lori and Kyle. Josh is more interested in pornography than school, and is devoted to \\"G-Force\\" online gaming. He introduces Kyle to basketball. Josh struggles during the first season, first with getting admitted to high school then with getting out of remedial classes. Josh is a schemer with a mercenary personality, and is unintentionally predictive about Kyle. His only love throughout the series is Andy Jensen. *Declan McDonough (Chris Olivero) is a spoiled rich kid and high school basketball star. He is the on and off boyfriend of Lori Trager, yet remains in love with her through the series. Declan's best friend is Charlie Tanner. He also becomes very close friends with Kyle, sharing Kyle's secrets and adventures throughout the series. *Amanda Bloom (Kirsten Prout) is the girl who lives next door to the Tragers. Kyle is drawn to the sound of her piano and immediately falls in love with her. She also feels an attraction to Kyle, but her mother tries to keep them apart. Kyle is afraid that Amanda will not like him the same if she knows of his origins, though she learns about many of his strange ways and abilities. Their romance continues through the series, even though they break up in season 3, but in the last episode Amanda reveals to Jessi that she will tell Kyle that she wants him back. *Jessi (Jaimie Alexander) is introduced in the second season. She arrives in the world in the same way as Kyle but shows a very different personality. About a day after Jessi is \\"born\\" she is found by one of MadaCorp's employees, Emily, then they give her a life-full of false memories that include Jessi being Emily's sister. In only small part of the second season does Jessi believe these memories are true, until Kyle reveals the truth about them. As the series progresses, she becomes an increasingly important part of Kyle's story and falls in love with him. Her experiment name is \\"781228\\" or \\"XX\\" Recurring Characters *Tom Foss (Nicholas Lea) is the antagonist in the first season, stalking Kyle in an old red truck. He appears increasingly dangerous as the series progresses and becomes pivotal to Kyle through the second season, but later on in season 2 he tries to help Kyle discover more powers and abilities. *Carol Bloom (Teryl Rothery) is Amanda Bloom's mother and lives next door to the Tragers. She has a bad first impression of Kyle that continues throughout the series. She tries to prevent the relationship between Kyle and Amanda, but softens towards the relationship as the series progresses. *Hillary (Chelan Simmons) is Lori's best friend, though she frequently fights with Lori. She makes a career decision in season two that has unexpected consequences for all the Trager kids. *Charlie Tanner (Cory Monteith) is Declan's best friend and captain of the basketball team.

Wes likes Lori and spends more time with her than Declan likes. *William Kern (Bill Dow) was a science professor at the University of Washington. He taught Baylin and was later recruited by Baylin to work at Zzyzx. He was in charge of \\"781227\\". *Dennis Bunker (Mackenzie Gray) works in personnel at Zzyzx.

Ottoman Army Years  Beginning in 1899, he started to take active roles at numerous battles for the Ottoman Empire. He was sent to Yemen to fight against the local imams that were trying to take the control of the region from the Ottomans. His efforts would help the Ottoman Empire to control Yemen until its dissolution after World War I. Later, he voluntarily went to Ottoman Tripolitania in 1911 to defend the Ottoman territories against the invading Italian forces. After a successful beginning for the Ottoman side, the Italo-Turkish War turned out to be an Italian victory in the end. An outcome that ended the Ottoman presence in the North Africa totally. Disappointed after the defeat, ≈ûahin Bey returned to Istanbul and was sent to the Balkan front immediately. Another defeat was waiting for him there. Turks lost nearly all of their territories in Europe. ≈ûahin Bey's return to the Western front would come after the Ottoman Empire entered the World War I on the side of the Central Powers. He was sent to Galicia to help the allies of the empire. He was later transferred to the Middle Eastern front of the war, specifically to Sinai in 1917. There he took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign which resulted with another defeat for the Ottoman-German alliance. ≈ûahin Bey became a prisoner of war in the hands of the British forces. He was not released until 1919. When he returned in 1919 to his homeland, Southeast Anatolia, he became the representative of the Ottoman Army, with a duty to control the important road between Kilis and Gaziantep. There he saw the disadvantageous results of World War I.  Local leader of the revolution  1919 was an important year for the Turkish revolution against the invading Allies. Mustafa Kemal was starting a revolt in Anatolia, and the French were invading ≈ûahin Bey's homeland. ≈ûahin Bey decided to join the spirit of the revolution and became the leader of the local revolutionaries. He was hoping to defeat the French Army, as his comrades had done at the Battle of Marash. For this purpose, he attacked Charles Joseph Edouard Andr√©a's forces, a spearhead group of the actual army, that left Kilis to Aintab in the morning of 26 March 1920. The combat started with the advance of the Turkish side, but turned into a defeat when the main French force arrived onto the battlefield. ≈ûahin Bey nevertheless fought against the advancing Andr√©a's troops and managed to stop them on Elmalƒ± bridge. On 28 March, he and his men were killed, allowing Andrea's forces could enter to the city of Aintab.Sel√¢hattin √Çdil, Hayat M√ºcadeleleri: Selahattin √Çdil Pa≈üanƒ±n hatƒ±ralarƒ±, Zafer Matbaasƒ±, 1982, p. 339.

He worked at the Royal Society, where he headed the media team, for eight years until 2006. He has a first degree in geology and an unfinished PhD thesis on palaeopiezometry. He once worked at HECSU. Views on climate change Ward's first significant involvement with climate change issues was in August 2005 when, as Royal Society communications director, he called on ExxonMobil to stop misrepresenting the state of the science. Ward's communications with the company included the statement he found it \\"very difficult to reconcile the misrepresentations of climate change science ... with ExxonMobil's claims to be an industry leader\\". Ward learned from the company's charitable giving statements that it had continued to provide significant funds to 39 organizations involved in \\"... denial ... overstating the amount and significance of uncertainty ... or by conveying a misleading impression of the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change.\\" In 2009 he commented on the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, saying that \\"The politicians won't be swayed by this. It's basic physics that the world is being warmed by greenhouse gases, and politicians can see through the sceptics' arguments.\\" He supported calls for an independent investigation into the controversy but believed the emails did not reveal evidence of wrongdoing. He also commented on how climate change denial had, in his opinion, been adopted as a political cause by the far right. Ward, Bob (2 December 2009), Climate change denial is the new article of faith for the far right, The Guardian In 2010 he expressed concern over reports that some Fellows of the Royal Society disagreed with the Society's official policy on \\"Preventing dangerous climate change\\" as stated in December 2009. In a letter to The Times and in an Op-Ed in The Guardian he urged the Royal Society to clarify its stance on global warming. In 2019, on the occasion of US President Trump's visit to the UK, Ward coordinated a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May. The letter, which was signed by 250 scientists, urged her to challenge President Trump on his \\"refusal to accept and address global climate change\\". Signatories included Chris Rapley, Hugh Montgomery and Joanna Haigh.

History North Greenwich Pier was originally built in the 1880s as a coaling jetty for the former Greenwich gasworks before this closed in the late 1980s. Most of the original jetty was demolished in 1997 to make way for the new passenger pier; however eight of the original cast iron caisson columns were retained to secure the new floating pier. Antony Gormley's 'Quantum Cloud' statue stands on the downstream group of four caissons. Design The new pier was designed by architect Richard Rogers Partnership with Beckett Rankine as the engineer and Costain as main contractor. The most striking feature of the pier is its 87metre long, 160tonne, bowstring canting brow which, unusually, is supported on three bearings.

He represented the Australian Labor Party from his election until 2001, when he left the party and became an independent. Murphy was born in Queenstown, Tasmania, and became a shearer. He became involved with the union movement, rising to become State Secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. He was also the secretary of the ALP's Industry Policy Committee in Tasmania. He attributed his October 2001 resignation from the ALP to their policies on logging. In the 2001‚Äì04 Parliament, Murphy shared the balance of power with Senators Len Harris, Brian Harradine and Meg Lees, who left the Australian Democrats in 2002. This meant that the government could pass legislation through the Senate only by winning the support of these Senators. Murphy often voted with the government to pass key pieces of legislation. An example of this was Education Minister Brendan Nelson's higher education reforms, which allowed universities to increase fees. Murphy did, however, vote down several pieces of government legislation; most notably when, in March 2004, Murphy joined with Harradine to block the full privatisation of two-thirds state-owned telecommunications company Telstra. Murphy was defeated at the 2004 election. His term expired on 30 June 2005.

Plot introduction Marco is the only heir to the wealthy Polo family of Venice. Unsupervised, he freely roams the streets and canals of the city getting in trouble. When he is falsely accused of murdering the husband of his lover, he is exiled from Venice and travels east with his father and uncle to the court of Kublai Khan, Mongol emperor of the orient. Marco remains in the empire for nearly twenty years and returns home as a wealthy man. His adventures become legendary. Plot summary Marco Polo is the last of the illustrious Polo family left in Venice, after his father and uncles moved abroad, leaving him and his mother behind. His mother dies when he is seven, and he becomes increasingly unruly as he is raised by family servants like Zia Zulia, and their black slave Michiel. Marco becomes friends with Venice's \\"boat children\\", a group of orphans who live on the canals of Venice, and becomes particularly close to Ubaldo and his sister Doris. Marco becomes even more uncontrollable when Zia Zulia and Michiel are caught sleeping together and subsequently run away.

It should therefore be used with caution if combined with other drugs that affect blood pressure, such as sedatives and anesthetic drugs. In horses Isoxsuprine is most commonly used to treat hoof-related problems in the horse, most commonly for laminitis and navicular disease, as its effects as a vasodilator are thought to increase circulation within the hoof to help counteract the problems associated with these conditions. Isoxsuprine is given orally, and many horses find the pills quite palatable. Isoxsuprine is a prohibited class B drug in FEI-regulated competition, and is often prohibited by other equine associations. It may be detected in the urine for several weeks or months following administration. It is therefore important to check the drug-rules within an animal's given competitive organization, before administering the drug. Because it is a vasodilator, it should not be used in horses that are bleeding, or in mares following foaling.

The episode brought back the video's popularity and boosted its views by over one million in the days following its airing. In The Office episode \\"Business Ethics,\\" Michael Scott confesses that when he discovered YouTube, he \\"watched Cookie Monster sings 'Chocolate Rain' about a thousand times\\". This prompted the creation of several such videos a few days later. While making a guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in April 2007, Paul Reubens debuted a spoof educational movie called Journey to Banana Land that beckoned \\"Chocolate Rain\\" when the narrator mentions cocoa trees; Zonday's YouTube video is used as Reubens sings along (Zonday himself performed the song on Kimmel in August 2007, to a mixed audience reception.) On 30 Rock, Liz called Toofer \\"Chocolate Rain\\" in \\"SeinfeldVision\\". It was also a reference on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Boating Buddies\\". Squidward spills hot chocolate on himself and SpongeBob says, \\"Chocolate Rain!\\" On July 28, 2017Phish.com Official Tour Archive (Retrieved April 3, 2018) the renowned rock and roll jam band Phish paid tribute to the song by performing it as the opening number to their Baker's Dozen chocolate donut themed concert at Madison Square Garden. Performed a cappella, it included the band moving away from their mics to breathe in. Commercials In November 2007, Tay Zonday licensed the song to and recorded spoof lyrics for Comedy Central as a promo clip for their show Last Laugh with Lewis Black. On November 28, 2007, Zonday released a spoof/sequel to the song titled \\"Cherry Chocolate Rain\\". The music video is professionally shot and makes many allusions to the original song. The song makes fun of itself with its over- the-top visuals and mentions how Zonday was \\"paid a hefty, hefty fee\\" to do the video, as well as featuring professional rapper Mista Johnson, who repeats, \\"He moves his mouth away from the mic so he can breathe.\\" The video and song were created as part of a promotional campaign for Cherry Chocolate Diet Dr Pepper. License The song and video are licensed under a Creative Commons by-nc-nd license. It has been suggested that the relative openness of the license has helped to encourage the song's spread. Creative Commons has praised Tay Zonday specifically for this very reason. Zonday has expressed his own thoughts on the licensing situation on his Myspace blog, stating, \\"I want non-profit radio and small mom/pop cafes to be able to play my music for free.

Cooling is achieved by pumping the liquid helium in the bath through a cooling coil via a needle valve and vacuum pump. The reduced pressure in the coil causes some of the helium to evaporate, creating a two-phase system within the cooling coil. The heat removed via evaporation lowers the temperature of the cooling coil closer to the lambda point. Since the cooling coil is immersed in the liquid helium bath, liquid surrounding the coil is also cooled. The colder, higher density liquid sinks away from the coil toward the bottom of the bath while the warmer, lower density liquid helium rises to the top. Liquid helium typically has poor thermal conductivity, so convective currents associated with a temperature gradient in the bath provide a constant flow of this colder liquid helium toward the bottom of the bath, allowing temperatures below 4.2 K to be realized in the helium bath, typically close to 2.2 K.

A√©roplanes Hanriot et Cie. or simply 'Hanriot' was a French aircraft manufacturer with roots going back to the beginning of aviation. Founded by Ren√© Hanriot in 1910 as The Monoplans Hanriot Company Ltd. the company survived in different forms until 1916 when it established itself with the Hanriot-Dupont (HD.) fighters and observation aircraft. The company lasted through several takeovers and structural changes until in 1936 it merged with Farman to become the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautiques du Centre (SNCAC). 'Central Air Works' consortium. Hanriot aeroplanes included pre-war monoplanes with boat-like fuselages, the HD.1 and 2 World War I biplane fighters, the HD.14 trainer, and the H.220 series of twin-engined heavy fighters that eventually evolved in the SNCAC 600 fighter just before World War II. The company's main bases of operations were B√©theny (a suburb of Reims) Boulogne-Billancourt, Carri√®res-sur-Seine and Bourges. History Ren√© Hanriot, a builder and racer of motor boats and a race car driver for the Darracq motor company, built his first aircraft in 1907, although it did not fly until late 1909. It was a monoplane with a wire- braced wooden fuselage resembling the Bl√©riot XI but was almost immediately superseded by a series of similar monoplanes, which were exhibited at the Brussels Salon d'Automobiles, d'Aeronautique, du Cycles et dus Sports in January 1910. These featured a slender wooden monocoque fuselage and were powered by a 20 hp Darracq and a 40 hp Gyp.Bruce 1966, p.3. and a handful were built. Together with Darracq racing colleague Louis Wagner, Hanriot started a flying school at B√©theny near Reims, where the Hanriot factory was located. Unusually, Hanriot tested new design features using a flying model powered by a 2 kW (3 hp) Duthiel-Chalmers. In 1910 Hanriot and his staff pilots made regular appearances at air shows in France and England. Hanriot's 15-year-old son Marcel became the youngest holder of a pilot's certificate, and joined his father's pilots as a competition flyer. Ren√© Hanriot then withdrew from competition flying himself and concentrated on constructing aircraft. Hanriot's 1911 military two-seater was passed over at the French military trials, among other reasons because its fuselage was so slender that the crew were completely unshielded. It was obsolete and never had a serious chance against contemporary Nieuport, Morane-Saulnier and Deperdussin types. Nieuport's former chief engineer Alfred Pagny designed the 1912 Hanriot, and the Nieuport influence was clearly visible, but it failed to gain any orders at the 1912 military trials and attempts to sell them were unsuccessful. Faced with bankruptcy, Ren√© Hanriot sold his assets to Louis Alfred Ponnier, who reorganized the company as the Soci√©t√© de Construction de Machines pour la Navigation A√©rienne (CMNA), headed by Pagny. In 1913, Marcel Hanriot, now 18, was called up for military service. The Ponnier factory continued for several years to develop the monoplane racer, one of which was placed second in the 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy competition. Following the outbreak of World War I, Marcel Hanriot, still in military service, flew French air force bombers. The German advance stalled with the CMNA/Ponnier factories in Rheims behind German lines, but Ren√© Hanriot founded a new factory, A√©roplanes Hanriot et Cie, in Levallois. Starting as a subcontractor building airplane components, the company progressed to licence-build aircraft from other manufacturers (notably the Sopwith 1 A.2 and Salmson 2 A.2). In 1915, Marcel Hanriot, after being seriously wounded in a night-flying raid, was released from military service and joined his father's factory. Around the same time, Hanriot hired the young engineer Emile Dupont and in 1916, the Dupont-designed fighter HD.1 was produced. Although being passed over by the French air force in favor of the more powerful SPAD VII design, the HD.1 was ordered by the Belgian and Italian air force. Heavy demand resulted in a new factory being opened in Boulogne- Billancourt (84, rue des Moulineaux). Licences to build the HD.1 were also sold to Macchi in Italy. Hanriot produced 5000 aircraft and employed 2000 workers in his Boulogne-Billancourt factory alone. After the war, Hanriot continued as a manufacturer of fighters and all-purpose aircraft, building on the HD.1 / HD.2 series but also bringing out new biplane and monoplane designs. In 1924, having outgrown its Boulogne-Billancourt works, the company moved to Carri√®res-sur-Seine Ren√© Hanriot died on 7 November 1925. His heirs, Marcel and his two brothers-in-law, entrusted daily operations of the factories to Outhenin Chalandre, formerly director of a paper mill. In 1930 the Hanriot company became part of the Lorraine-Dietrich company under the name Lorraine-Hanriot. The merger lasted three years, until in 1933 the two companies separated and Marcel Hanriot stepped once again forward to lead his family business. Under his management, the company embarked on an ambitious project to design and build state-of-the-art metal military aircraft like the H.220 heavy fighter. However its main successes would be with the liaison/training monoplane H.180/H.182 and the twin-engined H.232/H.232 trainer In 1936 the company was included in Pierre Cot's nationalisation programme, Merging with Farman to become the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautiques du Centre in 1937. Unlike Maurice Farman, who left the new company in protest, Marcel Hanriot stayed on as one of the directors. Nomenclature * The pre-war aircraft designed by Ren√© Hanriot went by Roman Numerals, the 1907 monoplane being the 'Type I'. Commonly however the planes were known by a description usually featuring the year of built and some characteristic such as 'monoplane', one- or two-seater, engine and horsepower. Thus Hanriot's first airplane was the '1907 monoplane', the type IV was the '1911 military two-seater' and the Hanriot VIII was known as the 'Hanriot 100 ch' (100 Hp Hanriot). The monoplane two-seater designed by Pagny is mostly referred to as the Hanriot 1912 monoplane or the Hanriot-Pagny 1912 monoplane. * The World War I and later biplanes designed by Pierre Dupont received the code 'HD.' followed by a consecutive Arabic number (HD.1, HD.8, HD.32 ...) * During the short stint as Lorraine-Hanriot, the designation HD. was kept for aircraft already in production but the prefix was changed into LH. for new designs. Around this time, Hanriot also adopted the habit by other French factories to add a number for the subtype directly behind the two-digit type number. Thus the HD.32-series 0 became the HD.320, the next improvement, series 1 became the HD.321 and so on... * After the merger with Lorraine was dissolved, Hanriot aircraft adopted the single letter 'H.', again followed by a design number. It also kept the now universal French habit of adding the subseries number directly behind the design number.

Walker served as the head football coach at Atlantic Christian College‚Äînow Barton College‚Äîin 1926, at Elon University from 1927 to 1936, and at Wake Forest University from 1937 to 1950, compiling a career college football record of 127‚Äì93‚Äì10. At Elon, Walker was also the head basketball coach (1927‚Äì1937) and the head baseball coach (1928‚Äì1937). In 1952 Walker moved to the Canadian Football League (CFL) to become the head coach of the Montreal Alouettes. He remained with the team until 1959, tallying a mark of 59‚Äì48‚Äì1 in eight seasons. Walker also played minor league baseball with a number of clubs between 1921 and 1932. He managed the Snow Hill Billies of the Coastal Plain League from 1937 to 1939. Early life Walker was born on February 17, 1899 in Birmingham, Alabama. He was the second of nine children born to Zachary T. and Miriam Walker. Walker's birth name was Daniah Clyde Walker. He changed his first name to Douglas while in college, but was known for most his life by his colorful nickname, which he acquired by the time he was a teenager.Walker briefly attended Birmingham College (later Birmingham Southern) then enrolled at Howard College in Birmingham. Though Walker played four seasons of varsity sports at Howard, he did not received a degree from the college. He did complete college work and received a degree from Elon College while he was working there as a coach, graduating with the class of 1931., After leaving Howard and Birmingham, Walker began his professional baseball career. In the off-season he taught and coached at high schools in West Point, Ga. and in Roanoke, Ala, from 1922-25. Walker also wed his first wife, Carolyne, at about this time. They had two children, D.C. Jr., and Walter Hill Walker, both born during his high school coaching days. Baseball Walker played minor league baseball in parts of eleven seasons spanning 1921 to 1932. Primarily a shortstop, he also played at second base and third base. He posted a career .300 batting average and 30 home runs in 1078 games. Notably, he batted over .320 four times, with a career-high of .338 in 1928 with the York White Roses. From 1937 to 1939 he managed the Snow Hill Billies of the Class D Coastal Plain League, leading them to the playoffs twice and to one league championship. Football Walker's coaching career began in 1926 at Atlantic Christian College, today known as Barton College, in Wilson, North Carolina, where he also played professional baseball for the Wilson Bugs of the Virginia League. In his one year as head football coach, Walker was 6‚Äì1‚Äì1 and his \\"Little Christians\\" (later, \\"Bulldogs\\") were scored upon only once. He also had success with the Atlantic Christian basketball and baseball teams. Next, in 1927, Walker accepted the position of head coach of all three major teams at Elon College (now Elon University) near Burlington, North Carolina. He coached at Elon for ten seasons, earning a 44‚Äì41‚Äì4 record and winning four North State Conference championships. Walker coached at Wake Forest University from 1937 to 1950. He compiled a record of 77‚Äì51‚Äì6 during his 14 years at the school and led the Deacons to two bowl games, a win over South Carolina in the inaugural Gator Bowl in 1946 and a 20‚Äì7 loss to Baylor in the 1949 Dixie Bowl. He is tied with Jim Grobe as the program's winningest head coach. Walker left Wake in the spring of 1951 over a salary dispute with the college's new president, Harold Tribble. Following Wake Forest's superb 1950 football season, in which the Deacons went 6‚Äì1‚Äì2 and narrowly missed winning the Southern Conference championship, the athletic committee of the Wake Forest College Board of Trustees approved a contract extension, and a raise in Walker's annual salary from $7,500 per year to $9,000. The committee action occurred in December, but by when March rolled around President Tribble still had not approved it. Walker attempted to use a coaching offer from Yale University as leverage to force Tribble's hand, but Tribble called his bluff, offering a raise to $8,000 ‚Äî or exactly what Yale had offered Walker to work as an assistant under Walker's long-time friend, Herman Hickman. Believing Tribble had gone back on a handshake deal, and miffed at the low-ball offer, Walker accepted the Yale position, ending the tenure of Wake Forest's most successful football coach. After one year at Yale, he replaced the retiring Lew Hayman as the second head coach of the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes. There he had a 59‚Äì48‚Äì1 record in eight seasons and won four division titles before retiring after 1959 season. After his retirement he became a scout for the New York Giants. He was elected into the Wake Forest Athletics Hall of Fame after his death in 1970. Later life and death One of Walker's longtime friends was Arnold Palmer, who Walker tried to recruit to his football team while Palmer was at Wake Forest. Walker died of a stroke on July 16, 1970 in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the age of 71.

Valerian is used as a herbal sedative which may be helpful in the treatment of insomnia. It is likely that several components of the plant contribute to the effect. Valerenic acid is thought to be at least partly responsible for the sedative effects. Valerenic acid acts as a subtype- selective GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator via a binding site in the transmembrane domain at the Œ≤+Œ±‚àí interface. At receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (frog eggs) it was shown that only assemblies incorporating Œ≤2 or Œ≤3 subunits were stimulated by valerenic acid. Modulation of ion channel action was not significantly dependent on incorporation of Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±3 or Œ±5 subunits. At the 5-HT5A receptor valerenic acid acts as a partial agonist. This serotonin receptor subtype is distributed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a tiny brain region implicated in the sleep-wake cycle. A study in 2006 found valerian extract as well as valerenic acid to inhibit NF-Œ∫B, a protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA, in HeLa (cultured human cancer) cells. This was measured with the IL-6 / Luc (Interleukin-6 luciferase) assay as a measurement tool. The study mentioned that such inhibition may be connected to the reported anti-inflammatory action of the valerian plant.

The line closed to passengers in the 1960s, since when various proposals have been made to reopen it. History The first part of the line opened in 1832 as the Leicester and Swannington Railway, which carried the products of collieries and quarries along the route to Leicester and the River Soar. The Midland Railway took over the line in 1845 and opened an extension in 1848 from a junction west of to join the rest of the Midland's system at Leicester Junction just south of Burton-on-Trent. This bypassed the Swannington Incline, which had a steep 1 in 17 gradient and was worked by a stationary steam engine. In 1849 the Midland opened a new line from a junction east of to Knighton Junction on the Midland Main Line south of Leicester, thus bypassing the narrow Glenfield Tunnel and completing a route between Leicester and Burton that could carry trains built to the Midland's standard loading gauge. Most passenger trains were taken over by diesel units from 14 April 1958, taking about 66 minutes from Leicester to Burton. The passenger service from Leicester to Burton was withdrawn six years later, on 7 September 1964. Incline The Midland diverted another section of the line from its original Leicester and Swannington alignment, between and . The new alignment bypassed the 1 in 29 Bagworth incline that had been worked by a stationary engine, so that locomotives could now haul trains over the entire route between Leicester and Burton. Freight Collieries at Ellistown, Nailstone, Ibstock, Moira, Gresley, Swadlincote, Woodville, Netherseal and Bardon provided mainly coal. The massive power station at Drakelow just outside Burton was a major consumer of coal from these collieries. More recently roadstone, gravel and granite have become the norm. Railway operations around these locations are covered in detail in Anthony Gregory's Life on the Leicester Line, an autobiographical account of his experiences as a freight locomotive driver in the 1980s and 1990s. Stations was the busiest stop on the line and had collieries at Whitwick and Snibston. A less busy but more fashionable stop was , an historic spa town with connections to Lord Hastings. In 1851 the Midland built branches from the line to Baumgartner, 1996, Chapter 2 and Wooden Box.Baumgartner, 1996, Chapter 1 In 1868 Wooden Box was renamed Woodville and in 1883‚Äì84 the Midland built an extension to the Swadlincote branch to Woodville, which included digging the Woodville tunnel. The two branches thus became the Swadlincote Loop. Future A train loaded with granite chippings from the Stud Farm quarry (at Markfield) moves on to the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line at Battleflat, just to the north of Bagworth. A train loaded with granite chippings from the Bardon Hill quarry departs south from the exchange sidings on the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line. , the line sees regular stone trains from the quarries at Stud Farm (near Markfield) and Bardon Hill. At the Leicester end of the line, Knighton North Junction has been dismantled and the former course of the line to the junction has been sold and turned into an industrial estate. The line's remaining connection with the Midland Main Line is Knighton South Junction, which faces southwards, away from Leicester station. Trains between Leicester and the line therefore have to reverse direction at the junction. Nevertheless, in the 1990s BR planned to restore passenger services to the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project. However, after the privatisation of British Rail in 1995 this phase of the project was discontinued. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£49 million proposal (Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network) to restore passenger services to the line that would include reopening stations at , , , , Moira, and (for Swadlincote). There is also some support in the Leicester area for the line to have new stations to serve Leicester City F.C.'s stadium and the suburb of Braunstone. In February 2017 it was announced that ultra-cheap no-frills trains would be tested on Britain's railways in order to reopen certain lines closed during the Beeching Axe of 1963. The Burton to Leicester Line was included in the proposals. The Campaign for Better Transport has identified the line as a priority 1 candidate for reopening. In December 2018 a campaign was founded to restore passenger trains to the line. It initially called itself the Ivanhoe Line Support Group. By May 2019 it had won the support of local MPs Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire), Andrew Griffiths (Burton) and Heather Wheeler (South Derbyshire). In July 2019 Derbyshire County Council, Leicestershire County Council and Leicester City Council all pledged funds to support the group, which is now called the Campaign to Reopen the Ivanhoe Line (CRIL). In November 2019, it was announced a feasibility study would be taken out in the new year on potential reopening of the line. It is hoped it would be completed by the end of 2020.RAIL Issue 892 p.28 It was announced by the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on 23rd May 2020 that the line would be one of ten schemes shortlisted for further business case development as part of the Government's 'Restoring Your Railways Fund', to reverse cuts made as a result of the Beeching Report.

This is done with a commonly horizontal bar that is divided into vertical stripes. Each stripe has a colour combination showing the \\"mood\\" within a short part of the audio track. The colour can depend on spectrum and/or rhythmic features of the part of the track. If the audio is a song then various parts of it (intro, choruses, solos, accents etc.) as well as changes (dynamics, rhythm, texture, playing instruments) are differently coloured on the bar. If the audio is a speech or an interview then the moodbar displays different speaking segments in unique colour combinations. Moodbar was originally presented by Gavin Wood and Simon O‚ÄôKeefe in their paper On Techniques for Content-Based Visual Annotation to Aid Intra-Track Music Navigation. Moodbar has been implemented for Amarok, Clementine and Exaile music players and the GJay smart playlist creator for Linux. As of 2008, the default implementation of Amarok's moodbar only uses the spectral content of the current section of the track. It calculates the energy in the low, medium, and high frequency bands, and turns this into the amount of red, green, and blue in the corresponding stripe. Each moodbar file is 1000 samples long, which corresponds to roughly 4-5 samples every second for a typical 3-4 minute long song. This is not useful for telling anything about the rhythm of a song, but it is sometimes possible to guess where different instruments are playing. This can be useful for spotting verse, chorus, verse structure, and breaks in the music.

Service in the German military was universal in nature in these areas, however assessing the number of ethnic Poles involved is difficult due to the fluidity of national identity. At the low end, Polish estimates often place the number of native Poles at 250,000. Ryszard Kaczmarek's conservative estimate, based on documentary evidence, is 295,000; however Kaczmarek considers this very low and is inclined to accept numbers of up to 500,000. Overall, nearly 90,000 former German personnel served in the Polish forces in the West. By Victory Day in 1945, nearly a third of the Polish servicemembers in the West were formerly in the service of Germany. In the Eastern Front, prisoner-of-war camps for Wehrmacht were a significant recruitment pool for the Polish Armed Forces in the East. Service in the German military or descent from such individuals (\\"grandfather in the Wehrmacht\\") had led in Poland to repression, discrimation and ostriacization. Even in the 21st century, descendants are often excluded from the Polish national collective. Estimates Some Polish citizens of diverse ethnicities served in the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, in particular in parts of Poland annexed to Germany such as Upper Silesia and Pomerania. Service in the German military was universal in nature in these areas, however assessing the number of ethnic Poles involved is difficult due to the fluidity of national identity. At the low end, Polish estimates often place the number of native Poles at 250,000. Ryszard Kaczmarek of the University of Silesia in Katowice produced a conservative estimate of at least 295,000 based on documentary evidence, however he consider this very low and is inclined to assume category III Volksliste were mobilized as others, which leads to a maximum estimate of 500,000. Early 1944 estimates by the Polish underground are similar at 400,000-450,000 Poles from Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Silesia. German authorities assumed those classified as category III Volksliste were in fact mostly ethnically Polish, and marked their military documents with \\"Pole\\". Motivation Various factors contributed to Polish service in the German military. From the Nazi perspective, racial theory saw Kashubians and Silesians as Volksgemeinschaft. From the Polish perspective, German citizenship was advantegous though it came with obligatory military service. Early German victories in the war, lended glamor to the service. Service was not simple collaboration, but was often a result of adaptation to a complex and fluid situation as well as opportunism. In 1943-1945, German losses at the front led to liberalization of racial rules and mass recruitment of Poles. In the annexed areas, registration as Volksliste was not only encouraged by the German authorities but also by the Polish Underground State and Catholic Church who wanted to preserve the Polish character of these lands. Thus, in the Katowice district 1.4 million people registered in the Volksliste. The number of residents who refused registration was relatively negligible. There was also a German storm brigade known as Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz formed by the German minority in Poland. Many of its members were trained in the Third Reich. As soon as the war started, Selbstschutz engaged in widespread massacres of Poles and Jews in West Prussia, Upper Silesia and Reichsgau Wartheland, together with the Einsatzgruppen. Polish Armed Forces In the Western Front Polish prisoners were first encountered by the allies in Prisoner-of-war camp for Afrika Korps soldiers. After realizing that a high number of prisoners were Polish, British and Polish Armed Forces in the West created a special section for recruiting POWs for allied service. Recruitment efforts intensified in the summer of 1943. In January 1944 after Henry Maitland Wilson expressed concern over the lack of Polish replacement troop, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders assured him replacements would be recruited at the front lines. In the II Corps, there were 2,500 ex-POWs by June 1944 which rose to 18,500 by 1945. Anders optimism was founded, and the Polish army in the West ended the war as a larger formation, due to POW recruitment, than its size at the beginning of Italian campaign. Overall, nearly 90,000 former German personnel served in the Polish forces in the West. By Victory Day in 1945, a third of the Polish servicemembers in the West were formerly in the service of Germany. In the Eastern Front, prisoner-of-war camps for Wehrmacht were a significant recruitment pool for the Polish Armed Forces in the East. Postwar Service in the German military or descent from such individuals (\\"grandfather in the Wehrmacht\\") has led in Poland to repression, discrimination and ostracization. Even in the 21st century, descendants are often seen as not fully part of the Polish national collective. During the 2005 Polish presidential election, Donald Tusk was attacked by Law and Justice's Jacek Kurski due to the service of Tusk's grandfather in the Wehrmacht.

This idealistic experiment of the Age of Enlightenment was intended to manufacture \\"ideal citizens\\" for the Russian state by bringing up thousands of abandoned children to a very high standard of refinement, cultivation, and professional qualifications. Despite more than adequate staffing and financing, the Orphanage was plagued by high infant mortality and ultimately failed as a social institution. The main building, one of the earliest and largest Neoclassical structures in the city, occupies a large portion of Moskvoretskaya Embankment between the Kremlin and Yauza River, boasting a 379-metre frontage on Moskva River. The complex was built in three stages over two centuries, from Karl Blank's master plan (1767) to its complete implementation in the 1940s. Today, the ensemble of the Orphanage houses the Academy of Missile Forces and Russian Academy of Medicine. Architecture Karl Blank's plans for the Orphanage, 1760s An outgrowth of the Russian Enlightenment, the idea of a state-run orphanage in Moscow was proposed by educator Ivan Betskoy and endorsed by Catherine II of Russia on September 1, 1763. Betskoy envisaged a spacious, strictly controlled, state-of-the-art institution that could raise abandoned infants and train them depending on each child's abilities‚Äîin craftsmanship, fine arts, or in preparation for university classes. Children born in slavery were automatically emancipated, and upon graduation could join the state service or the merchant estate. The institution was set on a large lot of land between Kitai-gorod, Solyanka Street, Moskva and Yauza rivers, site of a former armoury. Construction was financed through a public subscription. The Empress herself pledged 100,000 roubles; the largest private donations, from Prokofy Demidov and Ivan Betskoy, amounted to 200,000 and 162,995 roubles. I. L. Volkevich, History of Moscow Technical University, ch.2 According to the master plan by Karl Blank (assisted by Yury Felten), the Orphanage was designed as a chain of three square-shaped buildings: the eastern wing for the girls, the western wing for the boys and the central administration block connecting them. The inauguration ceremony, attended by the Empress, was held on April 21, 1764, although the western wing was not completed by Blank until three years later. The central building, constructed between 1771 and 1781, was surmounted by a square dome with a spire. The adjacent Moskva River embankment was paved in 1795‚Äì97 and set in granite in 1801‚Äì06. Although the eastern wing did not materialize, the Orphanage expanded continuously, under the supervision of senior architects Giovanni Gilardi (1790s-1817) and Domenico Gilardi (1817‚Äì34). Domenico and Afanasy Grigoriev designed and built the Board of Trustees building facing Solyanka Street. By the mid-19th century, the Orphanage had evolved into \\"a city within a city\\" ‚Äì a largely independent and wealthy institution housing thousands of residents. The bulk of the Orphanage survived the Fire of 1812 and preserved its original aspect until the mid-20th century. In the 1940s, the missing eastern wing was finally constructed to a design by Alexander Loveyko, who generally followed Blank's original plans, albeit in a considerably simplified form. Early years (1764‚Äì1797) Portrait of Ivan Betskoy. On the inauguration day, 19 newborn babies were brought to the unfinished Orphanage. Two of them were publicly baptized Catherine and Paul, after the Empress and her heir, but both died soon afterward. This was an early portent of extremely high infant mortality that would be characteristic of the Orphanage in the 18th century. Of some 40,996 children admitted to the Orphanage during Catherine II's reign, 35,309, or 87%, died during their stay there. As a result, the vast complex housed only a handful of survivors. A 1792 report listed as few as 257 resident orphans who studied a variety of trades ranging from metallurgy to accountancy. Several attempts to decrease mortality by passing infants on to foster families did not improve the survival rate. The aged Betskoy could not be relied on for managing the expanding faculty, and the Orphanage became notorious for fraud and child abuse. Alexandra Veselova, Betskoy's Concept Children lived at the Orphanage until the age of 11, whereupon they were sent for training to local factories and government offices. Some were assigned to the Michael Maddox theater school; others managed to qualify for free admission to Moscow State University. 180 students furthered their education in the universities of Western Europe. The majority, however, graduated with little more than a rouble in cash and a passport (which served to distinguish free men from serfs). The institution was managed by the Board of Trustees and financed by private donations and two special taxes‚Äîa tax on public theater shows and a tax on playing cards. For nearly a century, all playing cards sold in Imperial Russia were taxed 5 kopecks per deck on domestic-made cards and 10 kopecks on imports. As a result, every pack of Russian cards displayed the symbol of the Orphanage, the pelican. This tax generated 21,000 roubles in 1796 and 140,000 roubles by 1803. Beginning in 1772, the Orphanage also managed three banks: Loan Treasury, Savings Treasury, and Widows Treasury. These financial institutions, initially plagued by fraud and poor management, became effective and influential under the guidance of Empress Maria. By 1828, their total assets exceeded 359 million roubles, the largest capital assets in all of Moscow. Volkevich, ch.3 This stock was the principal source of cash for the Orphanage throughout the 19th century. Orphanage Theatre Moscow Orphanage. By Fyodor Alekseyev, 19th century In 1772, plans began to be formed for a \\"domestic theatre\\" affiliated with the Foundling Home. There were classes on acting, and the first production premiered late in 1773. In the course of 1778 alone, the Orphanage Theatre produced twelve comedies, two operas, and several ballets. By October 1783, the troupe of orphans had become so popular that Baron Vanzura petitioned the Empress to open this \\"home theatre\\" for the general public. Catherine readily approved the project of a public theatre and presented to the Orphanage a disused wooden building of the Golovin Opera House near the Yauza. The public Orphanage Theatre was inaugurated on 9 February 1764 with the pantomime The Marine Brigands and the ballet Venus and Adonis. The creation of a rival theatre company enraged Michael Maddox, an English entrepreneur who held the monopoly on public entertainment in Moscow. Under his pressure, the Board of Trustees agreed to close the Orphanage Theatre in November 1784, but the orphans were allowed to continue their acting careers on the stage of the Petrovsky Theatre, which was run by Maddox. Reforms of Empress Maria (1797‚Äì1828) Maria's death. In the 1820s, the Board controlled Moscow's largest bank. In May 1797 Emperor Paul of Russia asked his wife, Maria Feodorovna, to oversee the national charities. Empress Maria remained in charge of the Orphanage and similar institutions after her husband's assassination in 1801 until her death in 1828. Step by step, Empress Maria changed the social profile of the Orphanage. She encouraged a thorough inspection of prospective foster parents and limited admissions \\"from the street\\", measures which decreased the inflow of new orphans and considerably reduced mortality. By 1826, the mortality rate was reduced to 15% per annum, a figure outrageous by modern standards but a great improvement on the 18th century. The institution, headed by retired general Ivan Tutolmin, wasn't damaged during Napoleon I's occupation of Moscow, despite its proximity to the centre of the Fire of Moscow, which completely destroyed the adjacent districts, including Kitai-gorod and Taganka. While the French held the city, the Orphanage provided shelter for 350 children and an unspecified number of wounded soldiers. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Board of Trustees capitalized on the recent disaster by building cheap rental housing on its properties. As a result of this policy, the new facilities housed up to 8,000 residents of all ranks in the 1820s. Volkevich, ch.4 Empress Maria realized the need to downsize the institution, separating children from adult tenants and improving the educational program for the former. She detested the \\"dirty\\" appearance of trade workshops and transferred the younger inhabitants to new, independent orphanages. The Moscow Crafts College, the largest spin-off, was established as an orphanage for teenagers in 1830, and continues today as the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. In the old Orphanage, a premium was placed upon high-level educational programs along the lines of the \\"Latin classes\\" for boys (established 1807) and the \\"midwife classes\\" for girls. By the 1830s, the Orphanage finally achieved the espoused aim of taking the ablest children from the streets and preparing them for state service and professional careers. Among the teachers and tenants were Gerhardt Friedrich M√ºller, Alexander Vostokov, Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Nicholas Benois, Isaak Levitan, and Vasily Vereshchagin. Until the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Moscow Orphanage ranked among the most prominent national charities. 20th century The Bolsheviks disbanded the Orphanage immediately after the Revolution. The main building was conveyed to the Soviet trade unions, followed by Dzerzhinsky Military Academy and a long succession of state institutions. The satirical novel The Twelve Chairs features a famous episode: an abandoned wife chasing Ostap Bender, her runaway husband, through numerous editorial offices of the former Orphanage. During Joseph Stalin's reconstruction of old Moscow (1937), several Orphanage buildings facing Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge were torn down to make way for the new bridge. The right wing of the Orphanage was topped out by June 1941, but the project was not completed until after World War II. Viewed from the outside, this later addition is only marginally different from the left wing, to which the top floor was added at about the same time. The main building conforms quite closely to Blank's original designs.  21st century ‚Äì Parliament Center  Moscow chief architect A. Kuzminov proposed to house Russian Parliament Center in the premises of the Orphanage.

Saint Gwladys ferch Brychan or St Gladys (Latin-Gladusa), daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, was the queen of the saint-king Gwynllyw Milwr and the mother of Cadoc \\"the Wise\\", whose vita may be the earliest saint's life to mention Arthur. Gwladys's other children were Cynidr, Bugi, Cyfyw, Maches, Glywys II and Egwine. Today her main church and associated school is in Bargoed. Traditional history The medieval lives of Cadoc (by Lifris c. 1086)Lifris, 'Vita sancti Cadoci', Vitae sanctorum Britanniae et genealogiae, ed. and trans. A. M. Wade-Evans (1944), 24‚Äì141 and of Gwynllyw (c. 1120)'Vita sancti Gundleii', Vitae sanctorum Britanniae et genealogiae, ed. A. W. Wade-Evans (1944), 172‚Äì93 preserve different legendary details of Gwladys. Among the best attested of all of Brychan's half-Irish saintly children, she is also mentioned in Welsh king-lists. Both saint's lives agree that Gwladys, daughter of Brychan married Gwynllyw and gave birth to Cadoc. In the Life of Saint Gwynllyw, the king is just and fair and the marriage is accomplished peacefully, while the tale of Glwadys' marriage in Lifris' work seems similar to abduction stories in other saints' lives as well as in other Arthurian stories, indicating that it is myth rather than history. Here, when her father refused to allow their marriage Gwynllyw accompanied by 300 men abducted her from Talgarth. A pitched battle occurred which was only stopped by the intervention of King Arthur and Cai and Bedwyr who supported Gwynllyw and his warband in the battle. This act only occurred after Cai managed to persuade Arthur not to abduct the beautiful Gwladys himself. However, both lives agree that Gwynllyw later became a hermit and local saint. It was the prompting of Cadoc and Gwladys that led Gwynllyw to abandon his life of violence and seek forgiveness for his sins. A vision led him to found a hermitage on what is now Stow Hill in Newport, South Wales. Gwladys accompanied Gwynllyw into a hermits life and for a while they lived together there fasting or on a vegetarian diet and bathing in the cold waters of the Usk but moved apart to avoid temptation: Gwladys founded a hermitage at Pencarn in Bassaleg, supposedly at Pont Ebbw,Lifris, 'Vita sancti Cadoci', Vitae sanctorum Britanniae et genealogiae, ed. and trans. A. M. Wade-Evans (1944), 24‚Äì141 where there is a supposed grave and where she is said to have bathed in the Ebbw River, though Cadoc's life says that she later moved to Capel Wladus in Gelligaer. The Lady's Well at Tredegar may also have been dedicated to her and so, it has been suggested, once was St. Basil's, Bassaleg. There are also sites at the abandoned settlement of Pencarn itself and the nearby area of Coedkernew that also could be significant.

It was directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, written by Robert Rodat and aired on HBO on July 11, 1992. Plot Major League Baseball manager Sparky Smith is fired from his job with the Seattle Mariners. His attitude has gotten him into trouble with George, the owner of the Mariners, and no other teams seem to want any part of him. The Olympic Games are coming up, however, and a spirit of glasnost exists in the post-Soviet Russia, which is trying to field its first Olympic baseball team. Sparky reluctantly accepts an offer to move to Moscow to coach the players, many of whom don't even know the game's fundamentals. The players are predictably inept at first, but Sparky begins to learn the real joy in baseball is in the effort and the camaraderie. An exhibition game ultimately is arranged in which Sparky and his young, eager Russians get to play against his old team, the Mariners. Sparky also falls in love with young Russian girl Tanya Belova. Cast * Joe Mantegna as Sparky * Natalya Negoda as Tanya * Michael Lerner as George * Mark Rolston as Voronov Production Filming took place in Nat Bailey Stadium, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and in Moscow, Russia.

Developed in the late 19th century, the park is home to the Tennessee Valley Fair and hosts several dozen expositions annually. The park covers , and includes a exposition center, a 1910-era bandstand, a 4,500-seat amphitheater, and a lake, Lake Ottosee. The park is also home to The Muse Knoxville, a children's science museum formerly known as the East Tennessee Discovery Center. Background The land that became Chilhowee Park was initially part of a dairy farm purchased by Professor Fernando Cortes Beaman (1836-1911) in 1875. In the late 1880s, Beaman converted part of the farm into a park with the construction of dance pavilions and mineral springs. In 1890, William Gibbs McAdoo extended trolley tracks along Magnolia Avenue all the way to the park, connecting it with Downtown Knoxville. Later that year, the Lake Park Springs Addition Company, which had been formed by Beaman and several partners to develop the adjacent Chilhowee Park neighborhood,Brewer and McDaniel, p. 55 purchased the park. In 1910 and 1911, Chilhowee Park hosted the two Appalachian Expositions, which were held to demonstrate progress in Southern industry. Former president Theodore Roosevelt spoke at the 1910 exposition, and President William Howard Taft spoke in 1911. The expositions featured a large exhibit hall designed by architect John R. Graf, a Tennessee marble bandstand designed by architect R. F. Graf, and a building constructed by Knoxville College students to exhibit the city's African American history. The expositions saw the first airplane and zeppelin flights in East Tennessee, and helped boost the careers of local artists Lloyd Branson and Catherine Wiley. In 1913, the park hosted the National Conservation Exposition, which promoted environmental conservation in Southern Appalachia. Furniture store magnate James G. Sterchi purchased Chilhowee Park in 1920, and leased it to the East Tennessee Division Fair (the forerunner of the Tennessee Valley Fair). In 1926, the City of Knoxville purchased the park, and continued the lease. In the 1930s, Joe \\"Smoky\\" Ellison opened one of Knoxville's first bowling alleys at the park. Jazz musician Louis Armstrong performed at Chilhowee Park in February 1957. During his performance, an unapprehended person tossed a stick of dynamite from the window of a car in an unsuccessful attempt to disrupt the event. On August 8, 1863, the Military Governor of Tennessee, Andrew Johnson, freed his personal slaves. In the early part of the 20th century, August 8 of each year was the only day blacks in Knoxville were allowed to visit the park. During the early 20th century, the day was celebrated by blacks in Tennessee as a holiday.

It functioned as a Methodist church until the 1880s. The building was then converted into the McWayne School Annex, which held classes until 1978. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Batavia, Illinois was first settled in the 1830s. In 1834, Henry Lyon and Allison Speer were the first two Methodists to move to the village. A third Methodist, William VanNortwick, arrived a year later and allowed church services to be held in his house. As Batavia grew, the size of the congregation became too large to hold in a single house, and plans were made to construct a church building. The First Methodist Church of Batavia was constructed in 1852 for $6,000.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201307.pdf In 1854, Reverend E. H. Gammon was named the first minister. Gammon later accumulated much wealth in agricultural machinery and offered funds for the construction of a newer church. Upon the completion of the new United Methodist Church of Batavia, the original church building was sold to the Batavia Community School District. The old building was re-purposed as the McWayne School Annex and it was used as a school. In 1978, the school district opened two new schools and intended to destroy the McWayne School Annex. The plans were cancelled that year when it was purchased by the Buttrey-Wulff- Mamminga Agency, Inc. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 19, 1982. The Greek Revival structure was built of locally quarried limestone. The building retains its original wood gable, but it has been covered with asphalt for economic reasons. The bell tower was removed when it was converted into a school. Doric pediments adorn the north and south ends of the building. The interior features eight wooden columns.

History  The orchestra was founded by Ernest Powell in 1941, when a group of musicians gathered to perform Handel's Messiah. The group carried on and grew to become the South Birmingham Orchestra, performing concerts to support wartime charities. By 1946, E. David Ludlow had become the orchestra's conductor, and the present name was adopted in 1949. Kenneth Page took charge from 1959 after David Ludlow's death. From this point the repertoire became more adventurous and ambitious, with performing standards having to improve to keep step. The high point of this period was a performance of Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand at the Royal Albert Hall in 1984. In 1986, Kenneth Page resigned as conductor and was succeeded by Robin Page (no relation), who did much to maintain the already high standard that had been attained. He was succeeded in 1994 by Michael Lloyd of English National Opera, who is the current Music Director. The BPO typically performs 12-15 concerts each year in Birmingham and the surrounding area. Guest conductors and professional soloists are also engaged on a regular basis, and a professional leader is usually engaged. Strong links are maintained with the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, where the orchestra performs, and with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.

For example, dynamic microphones are velocity receivers. Likewise, many electronic keyboards used for music are velocity sensitive, and may be said to possess a velocity receiver in each key. Most of these function by measuring the time difference between switch closures at two different positions along the travel of each key. There are two types of velocity receivers, moving coil and piezoelectric. The former contains a coil supported by springs and a permanently fixed magnet and require no output signal amplifiers. Movement causes the coil to move relative to the magnet, which in turn generates a voltage that is proportional to the velocity of that movement. Piezoelectric sensor velocity receivers are similar to a piezoelectric accelerometer, except that the output of the device is proportional to the velocity of the transducer. Unlike the moving coil variety, piezoelectric sensors will likely require an amplifier due to the small generated signal.

Education Kindred McLeary studied architecture at the University of Texas and earned his degree in 1927. While teaching at the University of Texas the following year, McLeary entered one of his paintings, Cotton, in a national art exhibit at the Witte Memorial Museum in San Antonio. The painting portrayed an African-American woman reclining in a field of cotton with several men standing around her, one of them strumming a guitar. Some artists and ministers attacked the picture as obscene, but the art curator of the museum defended it and kept it hanging throughout the exhibit, despite the controversy.. Career McLeary began teaching architecture at Carnegie Tech in the autumn of 1928. McLeary was also a noted muralist. His best-known mural, Defense of Human Freedoms (1942), sometimes referred to as America the Mighty, dominates the 21st Street, N.W. lobby of the Harry S. Truman Building of the U.S. Department of State. When the mural was created in 1941‚Äì42, the building was planned for the use of the U.S. War Department, which moved into the newly built Pentagon in 1947, leaving the War Department structure with the mural to the Department of State. The mural is a depiction of the chaos of war and the enduring efforts of humanity to preserve freedom and civilization. It was covered over with plywood and drapery in 1954 and restored in 2010 for the debut of the George C. Marshall Conference Center inside the building. McLeary also painted murals in, among other places, his adopted home of Pittsburgh; at the Somerset County, Pennsylvania library; and as far away as New York City (at the Madison Square Post Office). Several large murals by McLeary from 1935, funded by the Works Project Administration, survive in good shape in the US Post Office-South Norwalk Main, but were hidden from public view in 1986 when that building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. and A mural in the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Pittsburgh, titled Modern Justice was damaged and lost prior to 1952, after the painted canvas panels fell off the wall in Courthouse No. 2 during a trial. Death McLeary taught architecture at Carnegie Tech until his untimely death, aged 47, following a fall from the roof of his studio near Confluence, Somerset County, Pennsylvania in May 1949.. He was buried in the Weimer Masonic Cemetery in Colorado County, Texas. Sources * McMahan, Truman.

A founding member of Gush Emunim, he served as the chief rabbi of Tekoa in the West Bank. He was well known for promoting and leading interfaith dialogue between Jews and Arabs, focusing on using religion as a tool and source for recognizing the humanity and dignity of all people. Together with a Palestinian journalist close to Hamas, Rabbi Froman drafted a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, known as the Froman-Amayreh Agreement. The agreement was endorsed by Hamas government, but it did not receive any official response from the Israeli government.  Career  Froman, a former Israeli paratrooper who took part in the 1967 capture of the Western Wall, was a student at the Mercaz haRav and Yeshivat HaKotel yeshivas. He was among the founders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement, and supported the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He obtained rabbinical ordination from Rabbis Shlomo Goren and Avraham Shapira, and then became the rabbi of Migdal Oz, a settlement in the Gush Etzion area. He was Chief Rabbi of the Knesset. He taught at several yeshivas, including Ateret Cohanim and Machon Meir, and was a lecturer at the Tekoa Yeshiva and Otniel hesder Yeshiva.  Views and ideologies = Interfaith meetings and dialogue  Rabbi Froman was involved in interfaith dialogue with Palestinians and Muslims, and participated in informal negotiations with many Palestinian leaders as he argued that peacemaking efforts between Israelis and Palestinians must include the religious sectors of both societies. Rabbi Froman conducted meetings with controversial Palestinian leaders, including with the late PLO Chairman and President of Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat, and the Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Mahmoud Al-Zahar. (www.arabicnews.com, 9 October 1997) Rabbi Froman had close ties with Palestinian leaders, as evidenced by a letter he sent to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas about his last conversation with Yasser Arafat: After the election of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Rabbi Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar and Hamas's Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.  Froman‚ÄìAmayreh Agreement (2008)  In February 2008, Rabbi Froman reached an agreement proposal with Khaled Amayreh, a journalist close to Hamas, for an Israeli-Hamas ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would put an immediate end to all Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians or soldiers, facilitate the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and end the Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas officials have endorsed the agreement proposal. The Israeli government, however, has not responded to this initiative, effectively rejecting it. Froman drafted the agreement proposal with Amayreh after meeting with him over the course of several months. The paper was finalized and shown to Hamas leaders in Gaza and Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshal who approved of it (see External links section). The agreement proposal was also submitted to the Israeli government but according to Rabbi Froman, the Israeli government never responded to it. The efforts of Rabbi Froman and Amayreh to meet with Israeli government officials were rebuffed. The agreement proposal called for Israel to lift economic sanctions imposed on the Gaza Strip and open all border crossings. The cease-fire agreement included the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces would end \\"all hostile activities toward the Gaza Strip, including targeted killings, the setting of ambushes, aerial bombardments and all penetrations into Gazan territory, in addition to ending the arrest, detention and persecution of Palestinians in the Strip.\\" The Palestinians would be obligated \\"to take all the necessary steps to completely end the attacks against Israel,\\" including stopping \\"indefinitely all rocket attacks on Israel,\\" assaults \\"on Israeli civilians and soldiers\\" and \\"to impose a cease-fire on all groups, factions, and individuals operating in the Strip.\\" Along with Amayreh, Rabbi Froman said that even if the attempt turned out to be merely an academic exercise, its elements could be used by the Jerusalem and Gaza governments. It does not, for example, include the recognition by Hamas of the State of Israel, instead \\"recognizing that there are Jews living in the Holy Land,\\" according to Froman, thus overcoming an obstacle that has long been a deal-breaker.  The importance of religion in the peace process  Rabbi Froman lamented the early 21st century violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and laid partial blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords on the tendency of Israeli and Palestinian secular negotiators to ignore and marginalize religion and religious leaders in the peace process:  Jerusalem ‚Äì a shared capital  Rabbi Froman supported making Jerusalem (the capital of Israel, also claimed by the Palestinians as their capital) the religious capital of all three monotheistic faiths. In November 1999, he participated in a conference with dozens of international religious leaders, including the Dalai Lama., by Elaine Ruth Fletcher (World Tibet Network News , 28 November 1999) In his 2005 letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Froman cited examples from Jewish tradition of the importance of sharing Jerusalem between all 3 religions and turning it into a city of peace:  Coexistence under Palestinian sovereignty  Rabbi Froman opposed the forced eviction of Jewish settlers from their homes in the settlements in the West Bank, and advocated that the State of Israel withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, yet leave the settlements and Israeli/Jewish residents in place under Palestinian sovereignty., by Meron Rapoport (Haaretz, 30 March 2006) He claimed that, if Israel withdraws from Tekoa and most residents leave, he will nonetheless stay because of his love of the Land of Israel: He was a strong opponent of Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza. In August 2005, prior to the implementation of the disengagement plan, he moved with his family to Ganei Tal in Gush Katif in order to show support for the residents being evicted., by Yoav Stern (Haaretz, August 2005) Rabbi Froman supported the Palestinian Authority's efforts to attain statehood recognition at the United Nations on 20 September 2011, and said that the establishment of the Palestinian state will benefit the peace process and Israel.  Personal  Rabbi Froman was born in 1945 in Galilee, Mandate Palestine. He was married to educator and artist Hadassah Froman, and the couple had 10 children. Upon being diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010, Rabbi Froman declared that he would add \\"Hai Shalom\\" (living peace) to his last name and re-dedicate his life to peace and coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Despite treatment by both conventional and natural means, he died on the evening of 4 March 2013, at the age of 68. His funeral in Tekoa on 5 March 2013, lasting 4 hours, was filled with music and poetry, and was attended by thousands of people of all political and religious ideologies.

It focuses on urban culture. It was founded in 1996 by Claude Grunitzky and sold to Alliance Trace Media in 2003.  History  Trace magazine was the successor to True magazine, which the Togo-born Grunitzky had started in 1995. When True failed after less than a year, Grunitzky, then aged 25, launched Trace, choosing the name for its inquisitive connotations and its similarity to the word 'race'.Claude Grunitzky and Steven Psyllos, 10 Years of Trace, (Booth-Clibborn Editions, 2006) The magazine featured on its cover some of the most high-profile black celebrities of the day, including Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Biggie Smalls, Diddy, Iman, and Naomi Campbell. The first cover featured Snoop Dogg and was distributed in the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, the US, Australia and Japan. In 1998, after 15 UK issues, Trace moved its headquarters to the US. Grunitzky cited at least part of the reason for this as the desire for a more accessible and dynamic kind of publication than was possible in London at that time. The magazine struggled initially; at one point, financial backing for the cash-strapped publication came via a $110,000 cheque from The RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, it has since become a well-respected voice within the urban style scene. Its cover stars have included celebrities including the models Naomi Campbell, Devon Aoki, Iman and Tyra Banks, the actresses Thandie Newton and Rosario Dawson, the boxer Mike Tyson, and the musicians Diddy, Common, IAM, DMX, Erykah Badu, Kelis, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Foxy Brown, Omega Sirius Moon, Gwen Stefani, Notorious BIG, Sean Paul, Rihanna, Mary J. Blige, Lenny Kravitz, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, Sisqo, Eve and Snoop Dogg. It has featured photography by Marc Baptiste, Ellen Von Unwerth, Albert Watson and Juergen Teller. It is credited with being amongst the first publications to have discovered the artists Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Rosario Dawson and Tiffany Limos. In November 2007, Trace marked its tenth anniversary with an issue published with three different covers.  Features  In its early years, Trace focused principally on hip hop culture, reflected in the large number of rap, hip-hop and R&B; artists featured on and within its covers. Around the early 1990s, it shifted to a broader approach, incorporating more high-fashion and travel features, and appealing to a wider range of racial and cultural backgrounds. Grunitzky cited his growing interest in the concept of \\"transculturalism\\", a term denoting the increasing prominence of individuals who \\"transcend their initial culture, in order to explore, examine and infiltrate foreign cultures\\".Claude Grunitzky, Transculturalism: How the World is Coming Together, (True Agency, 2004) Accordingly, later issues included \\"Brasil 2000\\", \\"Destination: Japan\\" and \\"High on Mexico\\". Nonetheless, since 1998 it has devoted one issue per year to the catchphrase \\"Black Girls Rule!\\".http://entwire.blackvoices.com/2007/07/19/iman-proving-that-black- girls-rule/ In 2003, Grunitzky sold the magazine to Alliance Trace Media (ATM) that was funded by the Goldman Sachs Group and individual investors. ATM was organized with 2 divisions: the magazine division led by Grunitzky and the audiovisual division led by Olivier Laouchez. Richard Wayner, former banker at Goldman Sachs joined ATM to lead the holding and support the magazine division. In April 2003, the first Trace branded TV network was launched by Olivier Laouchez. Then, in 2004 and 2005, Grunitzky and Wayner left ATM and Laouchez was appointed chairman & CEO of the Group with the mission to develop the audiovisual and digital activities worldwide.

It took place on a hill called Carn Fada at the southern end of the Kyle of Tongue, between Ben Loyal and the village of Tongue. It was fought between members of the Clan Mackay and men of the Clan Sutherland. On one side was the old chief, Angus Du (Dow) Mackay and his second son John Aberach Mackay. On the other side were Angus's cousins Morgan Neilson Mackay and Niel Neilson Mackay who were backed by troops from the Clan Sutherland, led by Angus Murray. Niel Nielson Mackay and Morgan Nielson Mackay were attempting to take the Mackay lands from their cousin, chief Angus Du Mackay. Background Niel Vasse Mackay, the eldest son of chief Angus Du Mackay had been imprisoned at the Bass Rock by King James I of Scotland in 1427, after the Battle of Harpsdale.: quotingquoting Gordon, Sir Robert (1580-1656) A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland pp.63-64. (See for details on Gordon's book). Thomas Neilson Mackay, brother of Neil Neilson Mackay and Morgan Neilson Mackay had killed the Laird of Freswick by the name of Mowat. He had pursued and killed Mowat with all his company, near the town of Tain in Ross, within the chapel of St Duffus, which he also burnt to the ground. Mowat had retired himself to the chapel to find sanctuary. The King soon after denounced Thomas Neilson Mackay to be a rebel and promised his lands and possessions for a reward to any that would kill or apprehend him. Thomas was captured by Angus Murray of the Clan Sutherland with the help of Thomas's own brothers Morgan Neilson Mackay and Niel Neilson Mackay. After being handed over to the king, Thomas was executed at Inverness. quoting Gordon, Sir Robert (1580-1656) A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland pp.64-65. After these events the Mackays were divided; the elderly chief Angus-Du Mackay and his loyal second son John Mackay were at odds with Angus's cousins Morgan Neilson Mackay and Niel Neilson Mackay, who had betrayed their own brother Thomas, and the Earl of Sutherland and Angus Murray offered Niel and Morgan Mackay rewards for their services, including their daughters in marriage. In order to complete his \\"design\\"; the Earl of Sutherland ordered all his forces to support Niel Nielson Mackay and Morgan Nielson Mackay in obtaining Angus Mackay's lands. Angus Mackay, by that time, was elderly and was at a loss as to how to act, but was advised by his second son John Mackay not to yield to any of their demands and that he would defend their country or die doing so. This affair was terminated by the decisive Battle of Drumnacoub, which has been described by the historians George Buchanan, Sir Robert Gordon, and John Pinkerton. The battle The forces of Angus Du Mackay, led by his loyal second son John Aberach Mackay won the battle, although Angus Du Mackay was killed. Niel Nielson Mackay and Morgan Nielson Mackay whose forces were defeated were both also killed, as was their father-in-law Angus Murray. Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656) wrote an account of this battle in his book A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland.: Angus Murray, for the performance of his engaged promise made to Niel and Morgan, gave them his two daughters in marriage; then gathering a company of Sutherland-men, with Earl Robert his attollerance, he went on with these two brethren into Strathnver, to invade the same. Angus-Dow MacKay hearing of their approach, convened his countrymen, and because he was unable himself in person to resist his enemies, he made his son John Aberach Mackay, commander of his host. When they were ready to encounter, some two miles from Tongue, at a place called Drum-ne-coub, Angus- Dow MacKay sent message unto his cousin-germans [sic], Niel and Morgan, offering them all his lands and possessions, except what is called Kintail in Strathnaver; which offer they did refuse, whereupon there ensued a cruel and sharp conflict, valiantly fought a long time with great slaughter on either side; Niel and Morgan trusting to their forces, John Aberach reposing his confidence in the equity of his cause, encouraged his men to assault their enemies afresh, who, with the like manhood, made stout resistance; by reason whereof there ensued such a cruel fight between them, that there remained, in the end very few alive on either side. John Aberach seemed to have victory, because he escaped with his life, yet very sore wounded, and mutilate by the loss of one of his arms. His father, Angus Dow MacKay, being carried thither to view the place of the conflict, and searching for the corpse of his unkind cousins, was there slain with an arrow, after the conflict by a Sutherland-man that was lurking in a bush hard by. Niel and Morgan, with their father-in-law Angus Murray, were slain; and as they had undertaken this enterprise upon an evil ground, so they perished therein accordingly. quoting Gordon, Sir Robert (1580-1656) A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland pp.64-65. Aftermath Upon the return of Niel Vasse Mackay, who had been imprisoned on the Bass Rock and who took over his deceased father's lands, he gave his younger brother John some lands of his own. Sir Robert Gordon also writes of the events after the Battle of Drumnacoub: The Earl of Sutherland being advertised how all passed at Drum-na-coub, and being informed of Angus Murray his death, he pursued John Abeerach so hotly, that he constrained him, for safety of his life, to fly into the isles. But John returning from thence the night ensuing Christmas, he came to Strathully (Helmsdale), and there killed three of the Sutherlands at Dinaboll, having invaded them at unawares; whereupon Earl Robert pursued John Aberach the second time, so eagerly that he was constrained to submit himself, and crave him pardon for his offence, which he obtained upon his submission. Then again John Aberach settled himself into the country of Strathnaver, where he continued until the death of King James the First, that his brother, Neil-Vasse MacKay was relieved out of the Bass (in 1437), by the means of the lady of that place, who was his near kinswoman. And at Niel his return into Strathnaver John Aberach willingly surrendered unto him all his lands within the country. Yet Niel gave unto his brother John the lands about Lochnaver, as a possession to dwell in during his days; which lands his posterity, the Sleaght-ean Aberach (descendants of John) 'do possess and inhabit at this day'. quoting Gordon, Sir Robert (1580-1656) A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland pp.66-67. The 19th-century historian, Robert Mackay, disputes the account given by Sir Robert Gordon of the aftermath of the battle above, noting that Gordon was of the Earl of Sutherland's family (kindred). Robert Mackay says that it is absurd to think that John Mackay would have immediately fled to the isles in fear of the Earl of Sutherland, whose power he had just broken, and that if John Mackay did go to the isles then it would have been to visit his cousin, Alexander. Robert Mackay says it is more probably that John Mackay pursued the Sutherlanders, rather than having fled returning to kill three Sutherlanders as stated by Gordon. The son of Niel Nielson Mackay who had rebelled against Angus Dow Mackay was John Bain Mackay who dropped the surname of Mackay and was progenitor of the Bain family. The second half of the 15th century had seen a series of raids by the Mackays of Strathnaver on the Rosses of Balnagown. According to the Blackcastle MS (which was written by Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who had access to the Mackay chief's family charters and papers) the Rosses had made \\"a predatory incursion\\" into the territory of the Mackays. Sir Robert Gordon however says that the Mackays \\"often molested with incursions and invasions\\" the lands of the Rosses.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 68. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. According to historian Angus Mackay the evidence is ample that the Mackays managed to recover some of the lands in Ross-shire that had belonged to their relatives and enemies, Neil Neilson Mackay, his brother Morgan Neilson Mackay and Neil and Morgan's father-in-law Murray of Cubin, all three of whom had been defeated and killed by the Mackays of Strathnaver at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 61-66 and 68. The evidence is also ample that the Rosses managed to secure some of these lands lying in the parishes of Edderton and Kincardine in Ross- shire. So it appears that the feud between the Mackays and the Rosses arose out of a scramble for disputed lands. Finally the Rosses gathered their forces to attack the invaders who were led by Angus Roy Mackay of Strathnaver, son of Neil \\"Vasse\\" Mackay, at the Battle of Tarbat, some time in the 1480's.

The earliest written account of pre-Imperial Mali was in the 9th century by Ahmad al-Yaqubi in his Kitab al-Buldan. In al-Bakri's reference of the Western Sudan written in 1068, he names two countries \\"Daw\\" and \\"Malal\\" located near the Niger and close to gold-fields, which are likely to be the core of the eventual Empire of Mali. Al-Bakri goes on to describe how the unnamed ruler of the kingdom was converted to Islam by a merchant when he witnessed the miraculous shower of rain that ended a drought. This event occurred at least one generation preceding 1068, since al-Bakri noted that the ruler's descendants and his nobles kept Islam, even though the common people were not converted.al-Bakri in Nehemiah Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds and trans, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History (New York and London: Cambridge University Press, 1981, reprint ed. Princeton, NJ,: Marcus Wiener, 2000), p. 82-83. Ibn Khaldun, a North African historian living in Egypt interviewed shaykh Uthman, who was the faqih of Ghana and described as wide and learned. Uthman provided information on the past kings, presumably from oral tradition current in his day (1394), and named the first Muslim king Barmandana.ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds, and transl. Corpus, p. 333. In al- Idrisi's account of 1154, he noted that the two towns of Daw and Malal had four days' travel between them, located in a river valley that joins the Nile (by which he meant the Niger). Malal was described as a \\"small town, like a large village without a surrounding wall, built on an unassailable hill of red earth.\\"al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl, Corpus, p. 108. Archaeology In 1965 and beyond a Polish archaeological team excavated at Niani, reputed to be the ancient capital of Mali. They discovered remains of buildings and other artefacts that showed a fairly intensive occupation of the site since the sixth century CE, though the site could not be classified as urban until much later, perhaps the fourteenth century. At its height, Niani comprised a number of densely occupied clusters scattered over the countryside, including a remarkable number of iron-producing sites, pointing to the town as a major industrial centre. There are also evidences of an Islamic presence, supporting the idea that there was a Muslim or commercial town and a royal town, as well as other sites. These excavations provided the strongest support for the traditional claim that a state of some complexity pre-existed the imperial period in Mali's history.The team's reports are found in W. Filipowiak, \\"L'exp√©dition arch√©ologique Polono-Guin√©ean √† Niani,\\" Africana Bulletin, 4 (1966): 116-127 and L'exp√©dition arch√©ologique Polono- Guin√©ean √† Niani en 1968,\\" Africana Bulletin 11 (1970): 107-17. Oral traditions Some of what historians have written about pre-Imperial Mali is based on oral tradition collected since the late nineteenth century. Much of the tradition focuses on the \\"Epic of Sunjata\\" a series of tales about early Mali that griots assemble into longer versions. There are several of these versions in print, the most famous of which is that of D. T. Niane, thanks to its lively narrative style and early translation into other languages. Niane's work, however, is not a literal translation of an original oral discourse, though it is surely largely based on tales told by a certain Mamadou Kouyate of Keyla.Djibril Tamsir Niane, Sundiata; An Epic of Old Mali (Tr. G. D. Pickett, Essex: Longmans, 1965; original French, 1960) Rather, it is a reworking in literary form of Kouyate's tales. More literal versions of the tradition have since been published in French, English and Mandinka versions.A literal transcript and French translation as well as linguistic and historical annotations is found in Youssef Ciss√© and Wa Kamissoko, eds. and transl. Soundiata, la gloire du Mali. La grande geste du Mali, (2 vols., Paris: Karthala, 1991) According to these traditions, the Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before Sundiata‚Äôs unification as a small state just to the south of the Sonink√© empire of Wagadou, better known as the Ghana Empire.Wagadou or Empire of Ghana Translated from French.

Another detailed episode was told that instead of one there is three Bilal sons that departing to Manden and founding the country of Manden there, where the eldest became the first ruler It was common practice during the Middle Ages for both Christian and Muslim rulers to tie their bloodline back to a pivotal figure in their faith‚Äôs history. Oral chroniclers have preserved a list of each Keita ruler from Lawalo (one of Bilal‚Äôs seven sons whom settled in Mali) to Maghan Kon Fatta (father of Sundiata Keita). Chronology The French colonial administrator and historian Maurice Delafosse was one of the earliest Western historians to attempt a comprehensive history of the region in his book Haut-S√©n√©gal-Niger (1912)Maurice Delafosse, Haut-S√©n√©gal-Niger (Soudan Fran√ßais) (3 vols, Paris, 1912, reprinted 1972), 2: 56-59; 155; 162-64; 173-184. produced a fairly detailed and exact chronology of Mali. However, he never explained how he arrived at the dates he presented there, or elsewhere, and indeed, the primary sources on which he relied did not give clear indications of chronology at that level of detail. Scholars since then, while occasionally noting the issue, have accepted this chronology and it is thus widely reported and repeated. There is little question that it is approximately correct, since the Arabic materials are fairly abundant and give a number of clues, but it would be wrong to repeat this chronology as being confirmed by original material. The Kangaba province According to modern traditions, during the height of Ghana's power, the land of Manden became one of its provinces, though the contemporary evidence of al-Bakri does not support such a large extent for Ghana's rule.A. W. Massing, \\"The Wangara, an Old Soninke Diaspora in West Africa.\\" According to traditions, the Manden city-state of Ka-ba (present-day Kangaba) served as the capital and name of this province. From at least the beginning of the 11th century, Mandinka kings probably known as faamas ruled Manden from Ka-ba Heusch, Luc de: \\"The Symbolic Mechanisms of Sacred Kingship: Rediscovering Frazer\\". The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 1997 The twelve kingdoms Modern oral traditions maintain that after the fall of Ghana the Kangaba province, splintered into twelve kingdoms with their own maghan (meaning prince) or faama.Niane, D.T.: \\"Recherches sur l‚ÄôEmpire du Mali au Moyen √¢ge\\". Presence Africaine. Paris, 1975 Manden was split in half with the Dodougou territory to the northeast and the Kri territory to the southwest. The tiny kingdom of Niani was one of several in the Kri area of Manden. Archaeological work places Niani, which later writers named as the capital of the country, in this region.W. Filiopowiak, \\"Recherches archeologiques\\" The Soso hegemony According to traditions current in the fourteenth century and reported to the historian ibn Khaldun by the faqih of Ghana, shaykh Uthman in 1394, the Almoravid movement weakened Ghana, to the extent that \\"the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were overcome by the Susu, a neighboring people of the Sudan, who subjugated and absorbed them.\\"ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl. Corpus, p. 333. Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kant√© took over the land.Nehemia Levtzion, Ancient Ghana and Mali (New York, 1973), pp. 51-2; 58-60. Sundiata Keita The tradition of the final emergence of Mali as an imperial power was also first revealed by shaykh Uthman, when he told ibn Khaldun that Mali emerged following its defeat of the Soso. \\"Their greatest king, he who overcame the Susu, conquered their country and seized their power from their hands, was named Mari Jata.\\"ibn Khaldun in Levztion and Hopkins, eds. and transl. Corpus, p. 333. The story of the rise of Sundiata (or Sunjata), as he is known modern tradition is still the most widely recited tradition among Mandinka speaking people, a group of stories concerning his reign known as the Epic of Sundiata. While there are many versions of the story, most agree that he was the son of Niani‚Äôs faama, Nare Fa (also known as Maghan Kon Fatta meaning the handsome prince). Sundiata‚Äôs mother was Maghan Kon Fatta‚Äôs second wife, Sogolon K√©djou. She was a hunchback from the land of Do, south of Mali. The child of this marriage received the first name of his mother (Sogolon) and the surname of his father (Djata). Combined in the rapidly spoken language of the Mandinka, the names formed Sondjata or Sundjata. The anglicized version of this name, Sundiata, is also popular. According to shaykh Uthman in 1394 as reported by ibn Khaldun, the name was \\"Mari, which in their language means 'prince of the royal line' and Jata, which means 'lion.'\\"ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds and transl, Corpus, p. 333. Sundiata was prophesied to become a great conqueror. To his parent's dread, the prince did not have a promising start. Sundiata, according to the oral traditions, did not walk until he was seven years old. However, once Sundiata did gain use of his legs he grew strong and very respected. Sadly for Sundiata, this did not occur before his father died. Despite the faama of Niani‚Äôs wishes to respect the prophecy and put Sundiata on the throne, the son from his first wife Sassouma B√©r√©t√© was crowned instead. As soon as Sassouma‚Äôs son Dankaran Touman took the throne, he and his mother forced the increasingly popular Sundiata into exile along with his mother and two sisters. Before Dankaran Touman and his mother could enjoy their unimpeded power, King Soumaoro set his sights on Niani forcing Dankaran to flee to Kissidougou.Levtzion, Ancient Ghana and Mali, pp. 58-61 After many years in exile, first at the court of Wagadou and then at Mema, Sundiata was sought out by a Niani delegation and begged to combat the Sosso and free the kingdoms of Manden forever. =Battle of Kirina= Returning with the combined armies of Mema, Wagadou and all the rebellious Mandinka city-states, Sundiata led a revolt against the Kaniaga Kingdom around 1234. The combined forces of northern and southern Manden defeated the Sosso army at the Battle of Kirina (then known as Krina) in approximately 1235. This victory resulted in the fall of the Kaniaga kingdom and the rise of the Mali Empire. After the victory, King Soumaoro disappeared, and the Mandinka stormed the last of the Sosso cities. Maghan Sundiata was declared ‚Äúfaama of faamas‚Äù and received the title ‚Äúmansa‚Äù, which translates roughly to emperor. At the age of 18, he gained authority over all the twelve kingdoms in an alliance known as the Manden Kurufa. He was crowned under the throne name Mari Djata becoming the first Mandinka emperor. Manden Kurufa The Mali Empire was the second in a wave of successive states forged in the Sahel characterized by stronger and stronger centralization. Whereas the Ghana Empire had very little centralization outside of the edicts of its emperor, the Mali Empire would emerge as West Africa‚Äôs first federalized state with sweeping laws that were more or less uniform over an area roughly the size of Western Europe. This trend of centralization would be adopted and further developed by the Songhai during Mali‚Äôs decline as well as Bamana, Wolof and Fula states thereafter. Organisation The Manden Kurufa founded by Mari Djata I was composed of the ‚Äúthree freely allied states‚Äù of Mali, Mema and Wagadou plus the Twelve Doors of Mali. It is important to remember that Mali, in this sense, strictly refers to the city-state of Niani. Mema was a powerful city-state near the bend of the Niger River outside of Manden. It was allied to Sundiata throughout his campaign against Kaniaga. Its faama (sometimes referred to as a mansa in oral traditions) was allowed to keep his crown and not prostrate before Sundiata, because of the latter‚Äôs exile at that court. Wagadou, another land outside of Manden, was also allowed to keep its monarch. The Ghana (\\"warrior-king\\") of Wagadou received the same benefits as Mema and for the same reasons. The twelve doors of Mali were a coalition of conquered or allied territories, mostly within Manden, with sworn allegiance to Sundiata and his descendants. Upon stabbing their spears into the ground before Sundiata‚Äôs throne, each of the twelve kings relinquished their kingdom to the Keita dynasty. In return for their submission, they became ‚Äúfarbas‚Äù a combination of the Mandinka words ‚Äúfarin‚Äù and ‚Äúba\\" (great farin).Person, Yves: \\"SAMORI: UNE REVOLUTION DYULA\\". Nimes, impr. Barnier, 1968 Farin was a general term for northern commander at the time. These farbas would rule their old kingdoms in the name of the mansa with most of the authority they held prior to joining the Manden Kurufa. The Kouroukan Fouga Immediately after being crowned mansa, Mari Djata instituted a universal constitution for all subjects of his new state called the Kouroukan Fouga. At a site just outside the town of Kangaba, he formalised the government and established the Gbara or Great Assembly. =The Great Assembly= The Gbara or Great Assembly would serve as the Mandinka deliberative body until the collapse of the Manden Kurufa in 1645. Its first meeting, at the famous Kouroukan Fouga (Division of the World), had 29 clan delegates presided over by a belen-tigui (master of ceremony). The final incarnation of the Gbara, according to the surviving traditions of northern Guinea, held 32 positions occupied by 28 clans. =Social, economic and governmental reform= The Kouroukan Fouga also put in place social and economic reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing women in government circles and placing a system of banter between clans which clearly stated who could say what about in who. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had a place in the empire and fixed exchange rates for common products. Another crucial fact established at the Kouroukan Fouga was the supremacy of Manden over all realms controlled by or allied to the federation including Wagadou and Mema. All future mansas would have to be chosen from the Keita clan, and the city-state of Niani (in present-day Guinea) would become the federal capital. Mansa Mari Djata returned to and rebuilt the capital of Niani, which had been destroyed by Soumaoro in his absence, and made it the most important center of trade in West Africa for the next 200 years. =Mari Djata I= Mansa Mari Djata‚Äôs reign saw the conquest and or annexation of several key locals in the Mali Empire. When the campaigning was done, his empire extended 1,000 miles east to west with those borders being the bends of the Senegal and Niger Rivers respectively. After unifying Manden, he added the Wangara goldfields making them the southern border. The northern commercial towns of Oualata and Audaghost were also conquered and became part of the new state‚Äôs northern border. Wagadou and Mema became junior partners in the realm and part of the imperial nucleus. The lands of Bambougou, Jalo (Fouta Djallon), and Kaabu were added into Mali by Fakoli Koroma, Fran Kamara, and Tiramakhan Traore, respectively. When Mari Djata I dies, as the result of either drowning in the Sankarani river or an errant arrow in a celebration, he had a standing army and control over the coveted trans-Saharan trade routes.

Beinn Ch√πirn is a Scottish hill five kilometres west-southwest of Tyndrum, it stands on the border of Stirlingshire and Perthshire at the northern extremity of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.  Overview  Beinn Ch√πirn reaches a height of 880 metres (2887 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn. It stands in the Cononish valley in the company of three other mountains (Ben Lui, Ben Oss and Beinn Dubhchraig which are all Munros and tend to overshadow the smaller hill. When seen from the east, Beinn Ch√πirn looks like a smaller version of the neighbouring Ben Lui, both having impressive east facing corries; it is sometimes mistaken for Ben Lui by motorists on the A82 road in Strath Fillan. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as \\"cairn hill\\",All above publications give this translation. This is thought to have originated because the hill was an important point on the ancient boundary between the kingdoms of the Picts and D√°l Riata.\\"The Call Of The Corbett\\", Irvine Butterfield, David & Charles Publishing, , pages 158, Gives details of name meaning. In recent years the hill has received some publicity after the discovery of a vein of gold on its slopes.  Geography  Beinn Ch√πirn has quite a high topographic prominence of 446 metres being surrounded by glens and low cols. To the north is Glen Lochy and to the south is the Cononish valley. Two km to the east lies another Marilyn hill, Meall Odhar from which it is separated by a col of 473 metres, while three km to the south west lies the Munro Ben Lui across a col of 434 metres. The hill has a fine east facing corrie, Coire na Saobhaidhe, which is small but has steep walls.\\"Climbing the Corbetts\\" gives information on Coire na Saobhaidhe). Just north of the summit at a height of 810 metres is an unnamed circular lochan about 100 metres in diameter. A ridge that goes south east from the summit contains a gorge down which the Allt Eas Anie flows in a series of waterfalls, one of which is quite large and impressive. This gorge gives a challenging ice climb when frozen in winter.ukclimbing.com. Mentions Eas Anie ice climb. The northern slopes which fall to Glen Lochy are clothed in coniferous woodland below the 350 metre contour. Drainage from this northern slope finds its way to the west coast of Scotland at Dalmally via the rivers Lochy and Orchy. Drainage from all other parts of the mountain goes to the east coast as it forms part of the headwaters of the River Tay.  Gold mine  In 1984 a gold bearing quartz vein was discovered by the Irish firm Ennex International on the lower south eastern slopes of Beinn Ch√πirn just above Cononish Farm at Eas Anie. The company spent over ¬£250,000 doing test drillings and were hopeful that the mine would be very productive. The gold, which is the most important deposit found in Scotland so far, occurs as minute particles inside Pyrite and Galena which in turn occur in the quartz vein. Despite claims that there are up to a million tonnes of ore present on the site which could produce five tonnes of gold and about 25 tonnes of silver, the location was only developed briefly in the 1990s when an adit (tunnel) of approx 1280 metres was driven into the hillside. In 1994, The Caledonian Mining Company acquired the mineral exploration concession with the intention of putting it into production, however the falling price of gold meant that such a small deposit was uneconomic at the time. Higher gold prices in 2007 have led to renewed activity with Scotgold Resources of Perth, Western Australia, purchasing the mineral exploration concession and applying to extend the lease and start gold production within two years, for a period of eight years. To date there has been no gold production or bulk trial testing and projected output figures are based only on geochemical assay from borehole cores and samples from the tunnel. However permission to commence commercial gold production has now been granted by the Crown Estate, which owns the rights to all gold in the UK excluding Sutherland, and by the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.\\"Geology and Landscapes of Scotland\\" Page 85 Gives details of Gold mine geology.Scotsman article 9/6/07. Gives details of gold mine.Scotsman article 30/5/07. Gives details of gold mine. Furthermore, tests have been successful and an estimated one hundred and seventy million pounds worth (of which sixty five million is tax exempt) of precious metals are in the site. The mining would commence over a ten-year period and at least fifty jobs would be created. The company Scotgold are considering the local area as well, because some of the money will go to the local community to help develop a visitor and heritage centre. They are also taking into account that the initial mine structure, set up in the eighties and nineties, is within a national park; meaning they are considering the possible complications that this may bring. See \\"The Environmental Impacts of the Cononish Mine\\" section for further details.Guardian article 30/10/11. Gives updated details of gold mine and environmental impacts.  Lead mining  The Eas Anie site was a major lead mining area from 1739 until 1923. The amount of lead mined led to a lead smelter being built in the mid 18th century in Strath Fillan just outside Tyndrum. The lead ore was brought off the hill and down directly to the smelter by a \\"gravity\\" track. At the time of the 1745 Jacobite rising, the English Jacobite Sir Robert Clifton owned the lease for the mine, the Argyle Militia suspected that Clifton was making the lead into bullets and sabotaged the workings and burned the miners' houses. In the ensuing years several firms tried to make a going concern of the mine including the Company of Mine Adventurers of England and the Scots Mining Company but turnover was greatly reduced by the end of the 19th century and the last lead was extracted in 1923.\\"Climbing the Corbetts\\" Gives details of lead mining.  Ascents  Beinn Ch√πirn has two popular routes of ascent and used together they can be utilised for a complete traverse of the hill if transport can be organised. One route starts in the Cononish glen and uses the south east ridge as a means of ascent, passing the old mine workings and waterfalls around the Eas Anie gorge on the way to the summit. The other route starts in Glen Lochy at grid reference , there is no footbridge over the River Lochy but a railway bridge can be used to cross the river if it is in spate. The route then goes through the forest following the water course into the Garbh Choirean and climbing onto the summit ridge. Another route starts from Tyndrum and goes over Meall Odhar via the Sr√≤n nan Colan lead mines before continuing to Beinn Ch√πirn by the SE ridge. The summit is a large flat area with an old fence crossing it just north of the cairn.  The Environmental Impacts of the Cononish Mine  Fistly the local community down in the village of Tyndrum, a popular tourist and walking centre bisected by the West Highland Way, locals talk positively of the project in the hills above them. The area has long attracted amateur gold panners, and John Riley, of Strathfillan community council says that the community is excited about the development. He also says that \\"The mine will provide obvious advantages in employment, training and education for young people and others in the community, which will have all sorts of knock-on effects on ancillary trades and hotels and guest houses.\\" \\"People will want to come and see the mine. It will have a very beneficial effect. Obviously there are environmental issues but we think they have been adequately addressed.\\"  References  * Geology and Landscapes of Scotland, Con Gillen, Terra Publishing, * Climbing the Corbetts, Hamish Brown, Victor Gollancz Publishing, * The Corbetts and other Scottish Hills, Scott Johnstone et al., SMC Publishing, * The Corbett Almanac, Cameron McNeish, Neil Wilson Publishing,  Footnotes External links * Cononish * Minerals in Britain - Gold * July 2006 Planning Application for re-opening Cononish Gold Mine * British Mining No 99 ‚Äì The Lead Mines of Tyndrum, Northern Mine Research Society (2015) Category:Corbetts Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Southern Highlands Category:Gold mines in Scotland Category:Climbing areas of Scotland Category:Underground mines in Scotland ","title":"Beinn Ch√πirn"},{"id":"12681805","text":"The 2007‚Äì08 Serbian League East season was the fifth season of the league under its current title.

Click to enlarge 'deFENCE' is an interactive conceptual art project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of Marcel Duchamp, the two main roles of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a mirror. The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation. The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries. The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

The film is narrated by Pierre Berton and produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Production City of Gold made innovative use of archival photos, combining narration, music and camera movements to bring drama to these still images. Its innovative use of still photography in this manner has been cited by Ken Burns as an inspiration for the so-called Ken Burns effect.\\"Capturing the American Experience: A Conversation with Ken Burns\\" by Mikel Vause\\"All That Glitters: City of Gold Revisited\\" by John C. Tibbetts The film grew out of an earlier 1952 idea to promote tourism and sport in Yukon. In researching the film, Low and Koenig found some still photos in an Ottawa archive and tried to improve the panning method Low had employed on his 1955 visual arts documentary, Jolifou Inn. Low then discovered a much larger set of archival images of the Yukon Gold Rush, from photographer Eric A. Hegg's collection at the University of Washington in Seattle. The problem of how to animate the images via camera movement prior to the invention of computer-assisted animation cameras was resolved by Kroitor, who enlisted British mathematician Brian Salt to devise mathematical tables, and developed a device dubbed the 'Kroitorer' that allowed one to take single photos of the archival images as if photographing real-life scenes with a hand-held camera.

In 1842, he settled a farm in the Yamhill Valley, in what is now Yamhill County, Oregon. During this time he helped build the Star of Oregon along with Felix Hathaway, John Canan, Ralph Kilbourne, Henry Woods, George Davis, Jacob Green, and later Joseph Gale. The ship was then sailed to California where it was sold in a three-way deal where the Oregon pioneers received cattle. Armstrong and the others then drove 1,250 head of cattle, 600 horses and mules, and 3,000 sheep overland back to Oregon, arriving in early 1843. On May 2, 1843, Pleasant Armstrong attended the meetings held at Champoeg, Oregon, where the pioneer settlers voted on whether to form a government. Armstrong voted for the creation of a government, and that faction won with a vote of 52-50, creating the Provisional Government of Oregon.

In 1939, the Nazi government expelled Jewish scholars from German universities. Many of them found teaching positions in Southern universities, where they sympathized with the plight of their African-American colleagues and students. Summary The horrors of prejudice became a common thread that could bind these exiled Jewish professors with their black students and colleagues. The film pairs shocking archival footage of the KKK dressed in costume and carrying torches with footage of Nazi salutes and marching German soldiers to compare the barbarity of both ideologies. A picture of a lynching shows a mob of average white citizens standing around casually and looking up at the tree, while photographs of the Holocaust depict emaciated corpses piled on top of each other. Showing the similarities between German anti-Semitism and Southern racism through a rich compilation of interviews, archival film footage, and photographs, From Swastika to Jim Crow shows that both African- American students and their Jewish professors were familiar with prejudice and felt isolated from European American southern society. Their common understanding bonded them together to create a safe haven of interracial, intellectual dialogue and friendship. When Germany forced its Jewish intellectuals to flee, America embraced high-profile thinkers like Albert Einstein, but the vast majority of lesser-known Jewish intellectual refugees struggled in America. Not only were jobs scarce because of the Great Depression, but prevalent anti-Semitism and anti-German sentiments meant the decision to take teaching jobs in the South was not based on the prestige of the positions, but rather because African-American schools had the only slots available to these normally discriminated against German Jews. These Jewish professors brought their proper German teaching style with them to America. They approached the classroom with strict formality, wearing full suits and insisting that students rise when answering questions. Although their students were not accustomed to being treated with such formality in the classroom, with time they grew fond of their professors' quirks. In addition to developing relationships with African Americans, the Jewish professors often served as a bridge between the African-American and European-American communities. In one instance, a professor organized a dinner with both African-American and European-American families. He asked the African-American guests, who arrived first, to sit in every other chair, so that when the European American guests arrived they would be forced to interact with one another. The professor knew he couldn't force people to give up their prejudice, but he was committed to doing whatever he could to encourage tolerance. Through these simple acts, the Jewish intellectuals planted seeds that developed into the Civil Rights Movement. By treating their African- American students with the respect and dignity they deserved, Jewish professors acted as catalysts for forward thinking that recognizes all citizens as equals.

The Interstate Highway connects Pocatello and Idaho Falls, the fourth and fifth largest cities in Idaho, and the smaller county seats of Malad City, Blackfoot, and Dubois. I-15 connects all of those cities with Salt Lake City to the south and Butte to the north. The Interstate has business loops through McCammon, Inkom, Pocatello, Blackfoot, and Idaho Falls. Route description I-15 is designated the Veterans Memorial Highway for its entire length in Idaho. Woodruff to Pocatello I-15 enters Oneida County from Box Elder County, Utah, south of the hamlet of Woodruff. The four-lane Interstate heads north parallel to the Union Pacific Railroad's Malad Subdivision rail line, a road named Old Highway 191, and the Malad River along the eastern edge of the wide Malad Valley adjacent to the Malad Range. I-15 has a diamond interchange with Woodruff Road at Woodruff and follows the western edge of Caribou National Forest. The highway passes just to the east of the county seat, Malad City, where the highway has a diamond interchange with the eastern end of Idaho State Highway 38 (SH 38). I-15 continues along Deep Creek to another diamond interchange with the western end of SH 36. From there, the Interstate follows the narrow valley of Devil Creek between the Bannock Range to the east and Elkhorn Mountain to the west. I-15 has one more diamond interchange in Oneida County next to Devils Creek Reservoir before the highway reaches Malad Summit, where the highway leaves the Great Salt Lake watershed and enters the Snake River watershed. I-15 enters Bannock County and descends into the Marsh Valley, named for Marsh Creek, which the highway begins to parallel at its diamond interchange with SH 40, which heads east toward Downey. At a diamond interchange at the hamlet of Virginia, the Interstate begins to run concurrently with U.S. Route 91 (US 91) and parallel Union Pacific's Pocatello Subdivision rail line and Old Highway 91. I-15 and US 91 have diamond interchanges with Arimo Road just west of Arimo and with the southern end of I-15 Bus. south of McCammon.

I-15 crosses over the rail line and Old Highway 91 as it curves west to follow the narrow valley of the Portneuf River between the Bannock Range to the south and the Pocatello Range to the north. The highway has partial interchanges with I-15 Bus. on either side of the tiny city of Inkom. I-15 begins to curve north at its four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Highway 91 at Portneuf shortly before entering the city of Pocatello. US 30 and US 91 split off from the Interstate at the next interchange, a diamond interchange with Fifth Avenue that marks the southern end of Pocatello's I-15 Bus. I-15 veers away from the rail line and the Portneuf River, has a diamond interchange with Clark Street east of downtown Pocatello, and collects the other end of I-15 Bus. at its diamond interchange with Pocatello Creek Road. The Interstate leaves the city of Pocatello at its directional T interchange with I-86. I-15 passes along the eastern edge of the city of Chubbuck, which is accessed using I-86. Pocatello to Monida Pass Idaho Falls, ID I-15 continues north onto the Snake River Plain and into the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. The highway accesses the reservation's main settlement, Fort Hall, via a diamond interchange with Ross Fork Road on the Bannock-Bingham county line. I-15 has a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 91, at which the highway crosses over Union Pacific's Montana Subdivision rail line, near the northern edge of the reservation; I-15 Bus. splits northeast with US 91 from this interchange. The Interstate curves northeast and crosses the Blackfoot River and begins to parallel the Snake River as it passes along the western edge of the city of Blackfoot. I-15 Bus. reconnects with I-15 at a diamond interchange with US 26 (Bridge Street), which runs concurrently with the Interstate leaving Blackfoot. The highway crosses the Snake River at the northern edge of the city. I-15 has a partial cloverleaf interchange near Rose before it crosses a pair of irrigation canals. The Interstate then travels across the eastern part of the Hell's Half Acre Lava Field ahead of its interchange with River Road, which provides access to Shelley east of the Snake River. I-15 enters Bonneville County one mile before its interchange with West 65th South near Woodville, which is simply given the destination of \\"Exit 113\\" northbound. US 26 and I-15 Bus. split off onto Sunnyside Road shortly before I-15 enters Idaho Falls. The Interstate has a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 20 (West Broadway Street), from which US 20 Bus. splits east concurrent with I-15 Bus., which returns to the mainline Interstate. I-15 and US 20 run concurrently to a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange where US 20 heads northeast as a freeway towards Ucon, Rigby, Rexburg, Sugar City, St. Anthony, Ashton, Island Park, West Yellowstone, and Yellowstone National Park. The Interstate heads north out of Idaho Falls parallel to the Montana Subdivision rail line, Old Highway 91, and the Snake River. I-15 enters Jefferson County just north of its diamond interchange with Osgood Road, and the freeway diverges from the Snake River at Roberts, where it has a diamond interchange with the western end of SH 48. I-15 passes Market Lake Wildlife Management Area ahead of its diamond interchange with SH 33 at Sage Junction. The highway has a diamond interchange with Hamer Road at Hamer and briefly passes through the Camas National Wildlife Refuge and crosses Camas Creek, which flows into Mud Lake.

HARC employs a staff of about 30 researchers and administrators. Revenues are projected to reach $20 million by 2008, primarily derived from projects supported by government agencies, foundations and corporations.  History  After founding The Woodlands in 1974, billionaire philanthropist George P. Mitchell began discussions with local universities including Texas A&M; University, Rice University, and the University of Houston in order to establish a center in basic, applied, and policy research. A feasibility study was conducted by Arthur D. Little, Inc., and it was concluded that The Woodlands would be a suitable site for such a facility. Mr. Mitchell then founded the research center in 1982, then named the Houston Area Research Center. HARC's first research program, a laser study of materials, was sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiative program in 1983. The following year in 1984, the University of Texas joined the HARC Consortium which already included the original universities that Mr. Mitchell had sought out. In 1985, an act of the Texas Legislature created HARC's Geotechnology Research Institute (GTRI), to improve technology used in oil and gas exploration. That same year the Center for Global Studies was merged into HARC as an operating division. The Center organized the Woodlands Conferences, managed the Mitchell Prize competition, and developed field work in Houston, the Rio Grande and Northeast Brazil. In 1986, NEC chose HARC for the location of its NEC SX-2, its first supercomputer in North America. The Houston Area Research Center changed its name to what HARC is presently known to stand for ‚Äì The Houston Advanced Research Center ‚Äì in 1990. Construction of HARC's microwave imaging facility was completed the following year. New laboratories were opened for DNA technology and geographical information systems. In 1993, HARC researchers in the high-bay test facility set a world record for the highest current through a super- conducting cable. Working together with Varian Instruments, HARC produced the world's first actively shielded magnet for NMR spectroscopy to The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston in 1995. After a review of HARC programs, in 2000 HARC leaders decided to narrow the focus of the organization. HARC was restructured to be an organization dedicated entirely to the application and development of sustainability science at the regional level. Since 2000, HARC's six core programs have grown and its revenues have increased fourfold. In 2005, George P. Mitchell established the Endowment for Regional Sustainability Science, which provides stable income for HARC's continuing operations. As of 2013, HARC engages in projects that help people thrive and nature flourish focusing on the science and engineering needed to understand and address issues related to air quality, clean energy, and water quality and supply.  Three priorities  # Air # Energy # Water  Air  HARC's Air Quality & Climate Program includes air quality research and management, air emission reduction technologies, emissions monitoring technology and policy, and regional impacts of and adaptations to climate change. HARC's air research program is multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, objective and non- partisan. HARC also serves as Research Management Organization to the Texas Environmental Research Consortium to advise policy decisions regarding air and climate.  Energy  The mission of the Clean Energy Program is to accelerate development and adoption of clean energy technologies, services, and policies that enhance regional sustainability. The work of the program includes several areas: stationary fuel cells; combined heat and power generation; energy market tools and products; strategic energy planning; clean energy applications analysis; and clean energy policy analysis.  Water  HARC's Ecosystems and Water Resources Program emphasizes biodiversity, water quality and quantity, ecosystem informatics, economics, policy, and social and institutional analysis. The goal of the program is to link ecosystems and water resources to sustainable development through improved understanding of the interactions between humans and these resources and to facilitate regulatory, institutional and technological change and improved decision making.

Together with his ally SƒÅ ø·∏ç≈´n al-·π¢urunbƒÅqƒ´, the other important Muladi rebel leader in Western al-Andalus, Ibn Marwan expelled the Banu DƒÅnis from Coimbra. Between 876 and 877 he also erected the Castle of Marv√£o, in Portugal, a place already known in the 10th century as Amaia de Ibn Maru√°n or Fortaleza de Amaia. His dynasty lasted until 930.

Once the site of a small Appalachian community, today the stream's area is home to the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and the Roaring Fork Historic District. Like many mountain streams, Roaring Fork is volatile. While the stream presents as a peaceful trickle on any given day, it quickly becomes a raging whitewater rapid after a mild rain shower. The \\"roar\\" of the water is amplified by its echo on surrounding mountain ridges. Geography Sandstone rocks litter the ground at the Jim Bales Place The source of Roaring Fork is located nearly up along the northern slopes of Mount Le Conte, where several small springs converge. The highest of these springs, known as Basin Spring, provides the water source for LeConte Lodge.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Oregon: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 11. From its source, Roaring Fork drops over just two miles (3 km), spilling over Grotto Falls and absorbing Surry Creek before steadying in a narrow valley between Mount Winnesoka and Piney Mountain. The mouth of Roaring Fork is located at the northern end of Gatlinburg, where it empties into the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. The Roaring Fork valley is underlain by Precambrian sandstone of the Ocoee Supergroup, a rock formation formed from ancient ocean sediments nearly a billion years ago. Roaring Fork Sandstone is found throughout the mid-level elevations of the northern Smokies, and is especially common in Greenbrier to the east and the Sugarlands to the west. Over thousands of years, erosional forces have carried boulders composed of this sandstone down from boulder fields located higher up along the mountain ridges.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 29‚Äì34, 68. This process has left the streambed of Roaring Fork and the flats in the Roaring Fork valley virtually covered with sandstone rocks of all sizes. Farmers who lived at Roaring Fork, the Sugarlands, and Greenbrier were continually moving and stacking these rocks, creating the characteristic rock walls that still criss-cross these areas today. Baskins Creek Falls, located along Baskins Creek Trail in the heart of the Roaring Fork area Roaring Fork Historic District tub mill Between 1800 and 1810, the first permanent Euro-American settlers arrived in the White Oak Flats area around what is now Gatlinburg. In the following decades, their descendants spread out into the surrounding coves and valleys. Richard Reagan (1776‚Äì1829), the son of one of these pioneers, settled on a large plot of land just south of Gatlinburg along LeConte Creek. Some of Reagan's children settled to the west in the Sugarlands, while some of them moved east to the hollow along Roaring Fork, which was then known as \\"Spruce Flats.\\" By 1900, three of Reagan's grandsons, Alfred Reagan (1856‚Äì1928), Aaron Reagan, and John H. Reagan were still farming along the stream, just above Gatlinburg.Jerry Wear, The Sugarlands: A Lost Community in Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), map on the last page (not numbered). Jim Bales Place, with barn (right), corn crib (left), and the Alex Cole Cabin (center) The Bales family settled in the upper section of Roaring Fork sometime in the 1830s or earlier. Caleb Bales (1839‚Äì1913), apparently a son or nephew of the first Bales to settle on Roaring Fork, owned a farm just south of the Reagan lands. Caleb's sons Jim Bales (1869‚Äì1939) and Ephraim Bales (1867‚Äì1936) would spend most of their lives on Roaring Fork farming land inherited from their father.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community in Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), map on the last page (not numbered). As the Bales and Reagan families lived on adjoining lands, it's no surprise that they intermarried. Caleb Bales married one of Richard Reagan's granddaughters, Elizabeth, in 1861. Ephraim Bales married a great- granddaughter of Richard Reagan, Minerva, in 1889. Caleb's daughter, Martha, married Alfred Reagan in 1879.For information on the genealogy of the families of Caleb Bales and Richard Reagan, see their individual entries at http://www.smokykin.com (retrieved: 8 August 2007). Uppermost on Roaring Fork, near where the stream absorbs Surry Creek, were farms owned by the Clabo family, Gilbert Ogle, and Jasper Mellinger. Former homesteads can usually be identified by the preponderance of young tuliptrees (rather than the more common hemlock or oak), as tuliptrees are the quickest to reclaim previously- cultivated land.Roaring Fork Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1999), 6. Around 1850, the residents of Roaring Fork constructed a crude road connecting the area to White Oak Flats (this old road is now a stop along the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail). By 1900, the community had matured into a mountain hamlet with its own school, church, general store, and tub mills. In 1976, the Roaring Fork Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Jim Bales Place The first historic stop along the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail is the Jim Bales Place, a farm which Jim Bales inherited from his father, Caleb. Jim, born James Wesley Bales in 1869, lived here for much of his life. He married Emma Ogle, a granddaughter of Gilbert Ogle, whose farm was located just above the Bales Place. As Bales got older, the farm passed on to other families, one of which erected a modern frame house on the land (known as the \\"fancy house\\") where they entertained visitors.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community in Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 75-85. When the Park Service gained control of the land in the 1930s, the frame house was torn down. The Alex Cole Cabin, being more representative of the pioneer days of Appalachia, was moved to the farm from the Sugarlands.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1994), 204. Bales' corn crib and barn remain, however. The Ephraim Bales Place The Ephraim Bales Cabin Just below the Jim Bales place is the farm of Ephraim and Minerva Bales. Ephraim, Jim Bales' older brother, farmed some of his plot. The other were mostly wooded, which the Bales family used for construction material and firewood.Roaring Fork Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1999), 9. The Bales cabin was a double cabin with a passageway known as a \\"dog trot\\" in between. Dog-trot cabins, which are fairly common throughout the southeastern U.S., typically involve two adjacent cabins with roughly in between, but with one continuous roof. The space between the two halves was relatively cool in summer and warm in winter, making it attractive to dogs. Both halves of the cabin have their own chimney.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), 16. With the exception of a back porch, the cabin remains largely as it was when the Bales family lived in here in the early 1900s. Along with the cabin, Bales' corn crib, hog pen, and barn are still standing today, just a few yards from the cabin. A rock wall and paling fence behind the cabin are representative of the two major barriers used in the Northern Smokies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Alfred Reagan Place The Alfred Reagan Cabin Alfred Reagan, a descendant of the area's first settlers, owned a small farm just below the Ephraim Bales Place. Reagan was a jack-of-all-trades, operating the Roaring Fork community's blacksmith shop, general store, and its most consistent grist mill. Reagan was also a part-time preacher at the Roaring Fork Church, for which he donated the land and helped build.Roaring Fork Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1999), 11-12. Of all the buildings on Reagan's farm, only his cabin and mill remain today. Due to its sawboard paneling and coat of paint, Reagan's cabin stands out among historical structures in the Smokies today. The cabin's design is known as a \\"saddlebag\\" design, which involves two cabins constructed around a single chimney.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), 16-17. A kitchen area was added later.Roaring Fork Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1999), 13. The Reagan mill is a standard tub mill, with a flume redirecting water from Roaring Fork to power a tub-wheel turbine. The turbine turns a grindstone which breaks down corn and wheat into cornmeal and flour. Reagan's mill was well-designed and well-positioned. It is said that when other mills lacked sufficient water power due to low water levels, Reagan's mill would continue to operate.Roaring Fork Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1999), 11-13. Alex Cole Cabin The Alex Cole Cabin is the last surviving structure from the Sugarlands community proper. Built by mountain guide Albert Alexander Cole, it has been moved from its original site to the Jim Bales Place along the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail.Paul Gordon, , 17 April 1974. Retrieved: 2009-09-21.Wear, 82. The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail is a narrow one-way road that is open to vehicular traffic (cars and small pickup trucks only) in Spring, Summer, and Fall. Along with the historic district, the road passes by two overlooks and a forest that is representative of mid-level elevations in the Smokies. The trail begins just past the Rainbow Falls Trailhead on Cherokee Orchard Road, and slowly ascends Piney Mountain, topping out at an overlook on the mountain's northern slopes (the overlook's elevation is roughly 3,000 feet/914 meters). Just past the overlook, the road passes numerous large chestnut tree blowdowns. These trees, which often grew to 5‚Äì6 feet in diameter, were killed off by a blight in the 1930s. As the road descends Piney Mountain, it passes a parking lot at the Trillium Gap Trailhead. This hiking trail leads past Grotto Falls and Trillium Gap en route to the summit of Mount Le Conte. Trillium Gap ‚Äî the gap between Brushy Mountain and the main Le Conte massif ‚Äî was named by Horace Albright, who observed the trillium-filled area in the 1920s.George McCoy, Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Asheville: The Inland Press, 1935), 41‚Äì42. Past the Trillium Gap Trailhead, the road steadies as it enters the upper reaches of the Roaring Fork hollow. Patches of young tuliptrees mark the former location of the Clabo and Ogle farms. Immediately after the road crosses Roaring Fork, the Jim Bales Place is visible on the right (east). The Grapeyard Ridge Trail, which connects Roaring Fork to Greenbrier, begins just behind the barn. Past the Jim Bales Place are the Ephraim Bales Place and Alfred Reagan Place. The road continues to descend past the historic district, passing along the way a parking lot that allows for an upclose view of Roaring Fork. A thin waterfall known as \\"The Place of a Thousand Drips\\" is the last stop along the motor trail before it re-enters Gatlinburg.

It was located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and operated from 1930 to 2011. Background St. Pius V High School, known first as St. Pius Commercial School, was founded by Rev. Francis Fagan, Pastor of St. Pius V Church and the Sisters of St. Dominic of Blauvelt, NY as a 2-year commercial high school in 1930. St. Pius Commercial served to educate the children of Irish, Italian and German immigrants, and its initial mission was to prepare these young people for office work in businesses and professional offices in the South Bronx, which was at that time the commercial center of the borough. At its founding the school was housed in a room of the St. Pius V (Elementary) School at 144th St. off Willis Ave. and had a student body of five taking instruction in bookkeeping, stenography, typing, English and religion. Initially, students entered St. Pius after 8th grade. However, the importance of a four-year high school diploma soon became clear, so two years of academic high school were made a requirement before admission would be considered for St. Pius Commercial. Within a few years St. Pius Commercial consumed the entire top floor of the elementary school building. In the years leading up to the Second World War, St. Pius admitted both boys and girls, but by war's end and forever after admitted only girls. In 1950, to meet the growing demand for space, Father Cornelius Hayes of St. Pius V Church acquired the Haffen office building between Third and Courtlandt Avenues at the foot of 147th Street. With the added space, St. Pius Commercial became a four-year high school. Finally, in response to changing trends in the education of women, the Blauvelt Dominican Sisters expanded the mission of the school and in 1962 St. Pius was fully accredited as an academic high school by the New York State Board of Regents under the name St. Pius V High School. During the last seven decades the student body has mirrored the shifting immigration and social patterns of the city. A school born serving the families of Irish, Italian and German immigrants now serves Latin-American and African-American families, and the families of Caribbean and Latin immigrants. What was once a school primarily suited to young women preparing to be office support workers now prepares young women for the rigors of the marketplace by focusing on college preparation. An average of 90% of St. Pius graduates are accepted to college, some choosing private schools and schools outside the city, such as Colgate, Cornell, Boston College, Middlebury, Skidmore and Johns Hopkins. The flight of landlords during the 1970s and the collapse of city services during the fiscal crisis left abandoned buildings and burned out blocks through every square mile of the South Bronx and many parts of Harlem - a new service area for St. Pius V as a result of the loss of several high school annexes for women during that era. With the flight of businesses, professional offices and the middle class from the neighborhoods we serve; and with the decline in standards of discipline and the upheaval in cultural norms after the 1960s, educational concepts and practices at St. Pius were tested. When she became principal in 1973, Sr. Mary Jo Lynch, OP oversaw the introduction of a value- centered approach to education that was far less doctrinal than had previously been the case at Pius. Personal responsibility and individual initiative became paramount, and Sr. Mary Jo became a proponent of using small, community-based schools to augment and extend familial care as a method for education and as a method for nurturing the development of the whole person. The breakdown of the neighborhood and its families was nearly complete by 1987, with the advent of cheap, accessible drugs and the culture of violence that the drug trade left in its wake. The crash of financial markets in October of that year precipitated school closings throughout the Bronx after the withdrawal of supplementary Archdiocesan aid to schools in low-income neighborhoods that were not subsidized by religious orders or were not directly run by the Archdiocese. Slated for closure in 1989, St. Pius received a new lease on life through the efforts of Principal Sr. Mary Jo Lynch OP and her appeal to members of the corporate community through contacts established in 1988 and 1989. After a personal meeting between Sr. Mary Jo and Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor, and with pressure from Jean Kennedy Smith and Chanel Fashions President, Kitty D'Alessio, the Education Department relented in its efforts to shut the school and thereby save the costs of capital improvements to the building and continued subsidy to the operating budget. During the early 1990s, a committee was formed under the leadership of Kathy Zamechansky, a Bronx-based businesswoman with strong ties to political, business and community groups in the Bronx and Harlem, and independent sources of funding were established. Mrs. Zamechansky initiated the annual Excelsior Awards Gala, and during its inaugural dinner in April 1993, JoAnn Mazzella Murphy '59 was honored and became the school's first benefactor. At about the same time, Sister Mary Jo was approached by a group of Manhattan-based corporate executive women under the leadership of Mary G. Berner, most recently CEO of The Reader's Digest, and the St. Pius Committee was formed. In 1996, the St. Pius V Board was organized, bringing together key members of the St. Pius and Excelsior committees, and the annual Hometown Heroes event was instituted. In the years which followed, foundations, alumnae, the unified Board and Mrs. Richard G. Cashin, the school's greatest benefactor, enabled St. Pius to renovate the school, upgrade technical systems, and maintain tuition at levels lower than any secondary school in the Archdiocese of New York. After the rise of charter schools in New York, enrollment at St. Pius began a gradual decline, finally reaching levels that could no longer sustain the school. On January 11, 2011, the Archdiocese of New York announced that St. Pius was one of twenty-seven schools that would be closed at the end of the school year. After 80 years of service to the neighborhoods of the South Bronx and Harlem, St. Pius V High School held its final commencement on Saturday, June 11, 2011.

The billed performer's act consisted of a single geek, who stood in center ring to chase live chickens. It ended with the performer biting the chickens' heads off and swallowing them. The geek shows were often used as openers for what are commonly known as freak shows. It was a matter of pride among circus and carnival professionals not to have traveled with a troupe that included geeks. Geeks were often alcoholics or drug addicts, and paid with liquor ‚Äì especially during Prohibition ‚Äì or with narcotics. Etymology and meaning The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the following for \\"geek\\": In modern usage, the term \\"geek show\\" is often applied to situations where an audience is drawn to a performance or show where the performance consists of a horrific act that is found distasteful but ultimately entertaining by masses. It may also be used by a single person in reference to an experience which he or she found humiliating but others found entertaining. It is used in derision. References in pop culture Freaks (1932) is a horror film with a long history of controversy because it used real carnival performers. In its original release, it became the only M-G-M film ever to be pulled from cinemas before completing its domestic engagements. In the film noir classic Nightmare Alley (1947), based on the novel by William Lindsay Gresham, Tyrone Power plays a sideshow barker in a seedy carnival which includes a geek biting the heads off live chickens. Power's character later succeeds as a charlatan mentalist, but then descends into alcoholism and is reduced to falsely portraying a geek as a means of survival in another sideshow. In one of Gresham's non-fiction books, Monster Midway, he details the process of making an alcoholic or a drug addict perform a geek act in exchange for a fix. In the television show Starsky and Hutch (1976), Huggy tells Starsky and Hutch that the guy they are looking for, Monty Voorhees, used to be a geek. Starsky explains geeks to Hutch. He also claims that the geeks formed a union in 1932, which he then admits he made up. \\"Well, suppose all they paid you in was chicken heads.\\" (‚ÄúBounty Hunter‚Äù, Season 1, Episode 22) The artist Joe Coleman bit the heads off white rats as part of his stage act as Doctor Momboozo in the 1980s. He primarily did a 'Human Bomb' show, self-detonating at the end, but also performed with the rodents for his turn as a geek. The 1990 Troma film Luther the Geek revolves around a geek named Luther, who eventually becomes a murderer who bites the heads off his victims. A geek show figures in the Katherine Dunn novel Geek Love (1989). Crystal Lil, the debutante mother of the freaks, met their father while performing as a geek during her summer break from university. Aloysius, the proprietor of the traveling circus, comments that college boys often toured as geeks during their summer breaks, but at the sight of the lovely Crystal Lil and her eagerness they made an exception. During a recounting of her time as a geek, Crystal remarks on how damaged her teeth were from biting the heads off chickens. In the 1998 Simpsons episode \\"Bart Carny\\", Homer and Bart are asked to perform in a geek show to pay off a debt: \\"You just bite the heads off the chickens and take a bow\\".q:The Simpsons#Bart Carny .5B9.12.5D Bob Dylan's \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", from the 1965 album Highway 61 Revisited, makes a reference to the geek. It is directed at the 'straight' Mr Jones, who is unable to come to terms with the counter culture youth revolution around him: :You hand in your ticket :And you go watch the geek :Who immediately walks up to you :When he hears you speak :And says, \\"How does it feel :To be such a freak?\\" :And you say, \\"Impossible\\" :As he hands you a bone. In the 1995 X-Files episode \\"Humbug\\", real-life sideshow performer The Enigma portrays a mostly-mute geek named \\"The Conundrum.\\" True to geek form, his willingness to eat anything plays a crucial role in resolving the episode's plot. In Marvel Noir, Norman Osborn has his henchmen all employed from various sideshow attractions. Adrian Toomes was a former Geek, and seems to have lost all conscience, as he devoured Ben Parker.Spider-Man Noir #1, 2 In the film The Wizard of Gore there is a show that opens with \\"The Geek\\" (played by Jeffrey Combs) eating maggots and then biting the head off a rat. In the first two episodes of American Horror Story: Freak Show, there is a geek named Meep (played by Ben Woolf) who performs in the Freak Show biting heads off of baby chickens. He is eventually wrongfully arrested and murdered by the other inmates in prison. In HBO's Carniv√†le, Ben Hawkins' father, Henry Scudder, deserted the French Foreign Legion and fled to America where he eventually succumbed to alcoholism and worked as a sideshow geek at Hyde and Teller's carnival.

What were her hallucinations begin to take objective form on the streets. The dynamics of Greek tragedy, always waiting in the wings, step forward to take control. Zina has won awards.

She first tries to play basketball, but is rejected by the coaches and other students because of her height. Anya then decides to join the soccer team. There, she meets Julia, who is already a member of the team but never gets to play any games, because the school team is one of the best and the coach is worried that having girls on the team would weaken it. This discrimination inspires Anya to go to the principal of the school, who agrees to let her form her own team with one condition; Her team must have a test match against the school's official team. Anya, with help from her friends, forms a team consisting of the \\"misfits\\" of the school. She starts with Luise (commonly called Loo), whom she has known since elementary school, and Felicitas (commonly called Filiz) who is known for her Gothic Lolita style of dress. Filiz's style gets the team noticed, especially when she designs the team uniforms which have a clear Gothic Lolita style: mostly black with a dark maroon stripe down one side and a smaller stripe crossing it along the top. The boys on the team have similar red stripes on their shorts, while the girls wear skirts with the red stripes along with striped stockings with lace. The girls also wear lace collars. The team eventually attracts 11 members needed to form a team. The side consists of Delia, who acts as the coach of the team and has a close personal relationship with the coach of the official school team (in the third book he is revealed to be her ex-boyfriend); Leon, who Anya has hated since elementary ever since he accidentally killed her hamster; Kevin, a musician known for his temper; Fraternal twins Alexia and Hannes, who joined in support of Anya after she was denied the chance to join the basketball team; Ellis, who is not as strong as the other players; and Olga, who likes Renaissance fashion. Throughout the graphic novels, there are some unidentified characters in the stories. The group is made up of a small number of students (chiefly a group of three). They are presumed to be from another school, who are interested in facing Anya's team in a match. These characters have been seen watching, taking pictures of, and discussing the fledgling team. Their identities have not yet been revealed. The books follow the school team, named \\"Gothic Sports\\", as they train and try to compete against other school football teams, including their main rivals, Lucrece High School's official team.

He played as a quarterback for Ole Miss in college, and was the head football coach at Northwest Mississippi Community College. He has been named to seven Halls of Fame for his athletic and coaching accomplishments. After retiring as a player, he coached at Georgia Tech and then became the defensive backs and special teams for the Dallas Cowboys from 1968 to 1972. He later coached for the Baltimore Colts and scouted for the Seattle Seahawks. He served as a college coach for Northwest Mississippi Community College for 26 years, 24 of those as the team's head coach. Early years Franklin was a four-sport letterman at Clarksdale High School in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was also named All-State, All-Southern Team and All America. Franklin was recruited by both Mississippi State and Ole Miss. He chose Ole Miss and was provided a full scholarship, attending the school from 1956 through 1960. He starred at quarterback for the Rebels, and led the team to three consecutive bowl game appearances. He was chosen MVP in the 1958 Gator Bowl in which his team defeated the Florida Gators 7-3. He was also named the MVP in the 1960 Sugar Bowl, throwing two touchdown passes in a 21-0 victory as the second-ranked Rebels defeated defending national champion and third-ranked LSU. Franklin had been injured earlier in the season and had been replaced in the lineup by Jake Gibbs. LSU had defeated the Rebels in an October 31 regular season game 7-3 with the only touchdown scored on Billy Cannon's famous \\"Halloween Run\\" punt return. While Gibbs passed for one touchdown in the Sugar Bowl game, Franklin led the attack, completing 10 of 15 passes for 146 yards. The team was named NCAA national champions by various selection committees. Professional career=Cleveland Browns Franklin was an 11th round selection by the Cleveland Browns in the 1960 NFL Draft, and was also selected by the Los Angeles Chargers of the newly-formed American Football League. The Browns also selected Ole Miss teammates Johnny Brewer in the fourth round and offensive lineman/placekicker Robert Khayat in the sixth round. Brewer played for the Browns until 1967 as a tight end and linebacker. Khayat never played for the Browns as he was packaged with offensive tackle Fran O'Brien in an April 1960 trade with the Washington Redskins for running back/placekicker Sam Baker. Khayat played for Washington through 1963, primarily as a placekicker. He achieved greater fame by returning to the University of Mississippi in 1995 as its 15th Chancellor. In joining the Browns, Franklin was reunited with former Ole Miss teammate, guard Gene Hickerson, drafted by the Browns in 1957. The two became lifelong friends and Franklin delivered the presenting speech on behalf of Hickerson when the latter was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Hickerson, suffering from dementia, was unable to make his own acceptance speech. The Browns utilized Franklin in the defensive backfield, where he played right safety. Prior to joining the team as rookie, he played in the 1960 College All-Star Game. Franklin led the Browns with eight interceptions in 1960, finishing fourth in the league. Three of those came in a single game, and two were returned for touchdowns of 31 and 37 yards in a 42-0 victory over the Chicago Bears on December 11, a day in which the Browns intercepted seven passes in handing the Bears their worst defeat ever. The two touchdown returns stood as a single game team record until David Bowens repeated the feat in 2010. In 1961, the Browns employed Franklin as a kickoff specialist in addition to his defensive duties. Franklin, who also served as the holder for field goals and extra points at Ole Miss, performed the same duties throughout his years with Cleveland, teaming with kickers Baker (1960) and Hall of Famer Lou Groza (1961-1966). In his rookie season, he scored the game's first touchdown with a 19-yard run on a fake field goal in the Browns' final exhibition game, a 14-10 home victory over the Detroit Lions. He repeated the feat in a 1961 league game against the St. Louis Cardinals, going 12 yards to score in a 21-0 victory. He was a member of the 1964 world's championship Browns team that defeated the Baltimore Colts, 27-0 and paired with Groza for three extra points and two field goals in the game. Franklin, who served as Cleveland's backup punter throughout his career with the team, punted four times for the Browns in 1965 and appeared in that season's championship game against the Green Bay Packers, which the Browns lost, 23-12. Exposed by the Browns in the 1966 NFL Expansion Draft to stock the new Atlanta Falcons franchise, Franklin was selected along with teammates Larry Benz and Dale Memmelaar. Released by Atlanta prior to the start of the regular season, Franklin joined Georgia Tech as a freshman coach. He rejoined the Browns in late September. He remained with the team through the rest of the season after which he announced his retirement to rejoin the coaching staff at Georgia Tech. Dallas Cowboys, Other NFL Affiliations In 1968, Franklin joined the Dallas Cowboys coaching staff under Tom Landry, serving as defensive backfield coach for four seasons (1968-1971) and as special teams coach in 1972. He coached in Super Bowl V and Super Bowl VI, earning his second NFL Championship ring in the second game. He served as the defensive backfield coach of the Baltimore Colts for the 1973 season and scouted for the Seattle Seahawks from 1980-1985. Collegiate Coaching Franklin purchased Best Dollar Store in Tunica, Mississippi and operated it as Bobby Franklin's Dollar Store for three years before accepting an offer to join the coaching staff of Northwest Mississippi Community College in 1979. He served as offensive coordinator for two seasons under head coach Ray Poole. He was named head coach in 1981, a post he held for 24 years, leading the Rangers to eight bowl games, finishing with a record of 201-57-6 before retiring after the 2004 season. Under Franklin, the team won the National Junior College Athletic Association championship in 1982 and 1992 and was runner-up in 1991. As head coach, Franklin helped to develop 35 players who went on to have careers in the National Football League and/or Canadian Football League. Franklin was named to the school's Hall of Fame in 2003. The school named its football stadium Bobby Franklin Field in tribute to Franklin in 2005.

They are named after mitochondria, due to their similarities in working inside the cell, and their reproduction. Abilities Nanochondria would be able to replicate themselves within the body, even to the point where a mother would pass them on to her children, reducing the need for them to be implanted after the first generation. Even a single nanochondrion inside of an egg cell would be able to replicate to the point where the person that was born from the egg would have nanochondria in every cell in their body. They would interact with and modify cells in the body, potentially allowing people to modify or even make copies of themselves. Due to this, they have been criticized for their ability to make synthetic humans, or even \\"natural robots\\", as well as their potential to damage DNA. Nanochondria would even allow a person to exhale a utility fog, allowing them to in effect \\"breathe\\" a needed tool. Nanochondria would have to be incredibly small, which would limit their computational power. To remedy this, they would be likely be able to communicate with each other, as well as other devices inside and outside the body, in an internalnet, in a distributed computing network. This would be likely to be accomplished by acoustic wave communication, or using wires composed of single electrons. Anders Sandberg has commented saying that \\"mitochondria ... just react on local conditions and indirectly cooperate\\". and that \\"It might be hard to make those pipes reliable\\", although he conceded that \\"linked nanochondria will be much more versatile\\". Nanochondria could be used to perform a diagnostic test on a person's own body, and then used to fix or even modify cells.

It is owned & operated privately in association with Shreveport Community Church (formerly First Assembly of God Church) which is located on the property of the grade school sister campus. History Rodney and Frances Duron, parents of the current chancellor, Denny Duron, founded the school in 1980 as a small kindergarten to eighth grade school. The high school was added as a second campus in 1989. Evangel has grown from 21 graduating seniors in 1990 to over 100 seniors in 2001. The school currently has over 675 students. As of May 2013, according to the SACS website, Evangel is one of twenty-five schools to have earned SACS accreditation in Caddo Parish, and one of eight private schools to have done the same. Evangel Christian Academy is a state approved (K(5)-12) school through the Louisiana State Department of Education. Athletics Evangel's football team has won over a dozen state championships since 1993. In a book cataloging the top twelve dynasties of high school football, Evangel was given a prominent place. Evangel also has baseball, basketball and softball teams. The Lady Eagles softball, tennis, and basketball teams consistently compete for the state title. The baseball team has won 5 state championships in 1995, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013. Evangel also fields tennis, golf, volleyball, wrestling, track and basketball teams at the middle/high school level and football, basketball, baseball and softball teams for most grades K - 6th. The Shreveport Country Club is the training ground and tournament facility for the Evangel golf and tennis teams and the Evangel swim teams. Arts The drama department puts on at least one major musical per year along with a straight play. ECA drama regularly participates in local, state and national drama competitions. ECA's band and choir have also grown in recent years. Beyond the traditional arts, Evangel offers two spirit groups, twirlers and cheer teams for their elementary school and cheer for their high school, both competitive in their various divisions. Campus The ECA high school campus lies on approximately in West Shreveport. The high school campus is home to the \\"main\\" high school classrooms (divided into \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" wings with ten rooms on either side serving various purposes) including a library with over thirty- five Dell Dimension 3000 desktop computers (20 more of which that can be found in the computer lab), a main and student office, and a high school cafeteria with food service provided by the Sodexho food service company. These were original at the opening of the high school campus and were built by previous private schools. Further back in the campus are the \\"T\\" (temporary) buildings which were added in 1993 by founder Frances Duron to accommodate the growing number of middle and high school students enrolling in the school. The campus also includes one tennis court, one softball, baseball, and football field, and a large basketball gym (built in 1997). The campus is surrounded by woods on two sides and by homes on the other two sides. During the summers the campus is used for summer sports camps. The elementary campus and Shreveport Community Church occupy approximately just minutes from the high school campus and located next to I-20. The elementary has recently moved into a new space inside of the renovated church including a new auditorium tailored specifically for elementary school students, a two story indoor climbing playground, several new outdoor play spaces, a fully equipped computer lab, a cafe for parents, and new daycare facilities.

The sanctions were the result of an over one year long investigation into the events surrounding the Moussaoui prosecutors' failure of accountability in this matter, as well as the many misrepresentations that were made to the court concerning Carla Martin's work in the case.

Building facade The ' (also known by its acronym MAP'; in ) is an art museum in Cusco, Peru, dedicated to the display of archaeological artifacts and examples of pre-Columbian artworks drawn from all regions of pre-Columbian Peru. The museum is situated on Plaza Nazarenas in Cusco's San Blas district, and has on permanent display exhibitions of some 450 individual representative artifacts that are drawn from the wider collection of its parent museum, the Larco Museum in the Peruvian capital Lima. History of the building Ceramic statue from the Museum The building where the museum is now housed was originally an Inca ceremonial courthouse. In 1580, it was acquired by the conquistador Alonso D√≠az and subsequently built over in Colonial style to become the home of an elite member of Cusco society, the Viceroy Hernandez de Cabrera, for whom the mansion is named. It then passed through many hands and had multiple functions, ultimately falling into a ruinous state. After a restoration by the Fundaci√≥n BBVA, the Museo de Arte Precolombino re-opened in June 2003.Ybarra, M. (2004, October 10). Not just artifact, but art. Los Angeles Times, pp. E40. Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo inaugurated the museum at the summit, saying \\"we are showing the world our cultural wealth. I am profoundly proud that [we can give to the summit] a little of the culture that belongs not only to Peru, but also to Latin America‚Ä¶ [The region must] look to its past to construct together a new Latin America with more health, education, justice for the poor and culture.\\"XVII Cumbre Presidencial del Grupo de R√≠o Exhibitions Ceramic vessel from the Museum The works of art displayed at the museum, encompass a period of time ranging between 1250 BC and AD 1532. There are a total of ten galleries: Formative, Nasca, Mochica, Huari, Chancay ‚Äì Chimu, Inca, Wood, Jewelry and Stone, Silver, and Gold and Metals. The Formative Gallery houses pieces from many diverse cultures. Among these are Cupisnique, Salinar, Vicus, Viru and Paracas in its older phase or ‚Äúcavernas‚Äù. During this period (1250 B. C - 1 A. D.) there is a remarkable advance in ceramic art. Painting and sculpture take in place; there are beautifully naturalistic and symbolic representations; many of them enriched by the use of incise decoration in which the Cupisnique artist get to a high development. The Inca culture conquered all the territory of pre-Columbian Peru where they restored with great political ability the Tahuantinsuyo empire. In the Inca Gallery magnificent ceramic objects are showcased like the emblematic aribalos or monumental vessels. These pieces have many decorative elements that transmit a subtle message of organization and symbolism. One of these aribalos is of great size and is unique to the collection. Other points of interest The Museum's Auditorium seats 120 people and often houses lectures and other local events.

Saporin is a so-called ribosome inactivating protein (RIP), due to its N-glycosidase activity, from the seeds of Saponaria officinalis (common name: soapwort). It was first described by Fiorenzo Stirpe and his colleagues in 1983 in an article that illustrated the unusual stability of the protein. Among the RIPs are some of the most toxic molecules known, including ricin and abrin (the latter is the poison preferred by the characters in The Blue Lagoon). These toxins contain a second protein subunit, which inserts the RIP into a cell, making it able to enzymatically inactivate the ribosomes, shutting down protein synthesis and resulting in cell death, and eventually causing death of the victim. Saporin has no chain capable of inserting it into the cell. Thus it and the soapwort plant are safe to handle. This has aided its use in research. If given a method of entry into the cell, saporin becomes a very potent toxin, since its enzymatic activity is among the highest of all RIPs. The enzymatic activity of RIPs is unusually specific: a single adenine base is removed from the ribosomal RNA of the large subunit of the ribosome. This is the Achilles‚Äô heel of the ribosome; the removal of this base completely inhibits the ability of that ribosome to participate in protein synthesis. The fungal toxin alpha-sarcin cuts the ribosomal RNA at the adjacent base, also causing protein synthesis inhibition. The conversion of saporin into a toxin has been used to create a series of research molecules. Attachment of saporin to something that enters the cell will convert it into a toxin for that cell. If the agent is specific for a single cell type, by being an antibody specific for some molecule that is only presented on the surface of the target cell type, then a set group of cells can be removed. This has many applications, some more successful than others. Saporin is not the only molecule that is used in this way; the enzymatic chain of ricin, the RIP gelonin, the enzymatic chain of Pseudomonas exotoxin, the enzymatic chain of diphtheria toxin have also been used, again with variations in success. Immunotoxins consisting of a monoclonal antibody linked to saporin have been developed and evaluated in formal clinical trials in patients with leukaemia and lymphoma in the UK and Germany. One disadvantage of these types of immunotoxin for clinical use is their relatively narrow therapeutic window and associated potentially life-threatening toxicities at dose levels that are therapeutic. During the past 15 years the research group of Dr David Flavell at Southampton General Hospital in the UK have been investigating various ways of improving the potency and widening the therapeutic window for saporin-based immunotoxins thereby opening up new possibilities for this class of drug. Most recently saponins (not to be confused with saporin) from Gypsophila paniculata have been shown to significantly augment saporin-based immunotoxins directed against human cancer cells by several orders of magnitude. In the last 15 years, in research begun by R. G. Wiley of Vanderbilt University, saporin has been used mainly to target specific neuronal populations in lab animals and eliminate them. This allows the researcher to observe the behavioral changes and associate them with the neuronal populations that were eliminated. For instance, the elimination of the cholinergic neurons of the rat basal forebrain by the toxin created by attaching saporin to an antibody that attaches to, and then internalizes into, only these neurons has created a mimic for the crucial result of Alzheimer's disease in humans. In this way, collateral results of the progression of the disease or drugs for the intervention can be studied. More than 300 scientific articles have been published utilizing saporin for study of the nervous systems, and more than 15 specific toxins have been created. Saporin‚Äôs success is probably due to its stability. Santanche et al. have evaluated the physical characteristics of the protein and conclude ‚Äú(t)he remarkable resistance of saporin to denaturation and proteolysis suggests this protein as an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications‚Äù.

Moscati was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1987; his feast day is 16 November. Youth Moscati was the seventh of nine children born to a noble Beneventene family which came from the village of Santa Lucia in Serino, near Avellino. His father, Francesco, was well known as a lawyer and magistrate in the area; his mother, Rosa De Luca dei Marchesi di Roseto, was of noble birth. Portrait photograph of Moscati as a child Moscati was born in Benevento in 1880; to commemorate his ties to the area, a marble statue has since been erected in the chapel of the Holy Sacrament in Benevento's cathedral. He was baptized six days after his birth, and took his first Communion at eight years old. Moscati moved with his family to Naples in 1884, and would spend much of the rest of his life in the city. During this time his family would spend its summers in Avellino, and Giuseppe would see his father serve at the altar in the local chapel of the Poor Clares whenever they attended Mass. At the age of ten, he was confirmed into the Church, at which time his family met Bartolo Longo and spent some time in the household of Caterina Volpicelli. The latter was to become among his most important spiritual guides later in life. Studies After finishing his elementary schooling in 1889, Moscati entered into the Liceo Vittorio Emanuele II in Naples, where among his professors was vulcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli. In 1892 his brother, Alberto, received incurable head trauma in a fall from a horse during his military service. Observing the care which Alberto received at home inspired in Giuseppe an interest in medicine, which he pursued after graduating from the Liceo in 1897; it was in the same year that his father died. Moscati received his doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Naples in 1903. The subject of his thesis was hepatic urogenesis. Medical career Immediately upon receiving his degree, Moscati joined the staff of the Ospedale degli Incurabili,Ospedali Riuniti degli Incurabili eventually becoming an administrator. During this time he continued to study, conducting medical research when not performing his duties at the hospital. Already recognized for his commitment to his duties, he won further recognition for his actions in the aftermath of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 8 April 1906. One of the hospitals for which Moscati was responsible, at Torre del Greco, was located a few miles from the volcano's crater. Many of its patients were elderly, and many were paralytics as well. Moscati oversaw the evacuation of the building, getting them all out just before the roof collapsed due to the ash. He sent a letter to the general director of the Neapolitan hospital service, insisting on thanking those who had helped in the evacuation, yet not mentioning his own name. When cholera broke out in Naples in 1911, Moscati was charged by the civic government with performing public health inspections, and with researching both the origins of the disease and the best ways to eradicate it. This he did quickly, presenting his suggestions to city officials. To his satisfaction, most of these ideas were put into practice by the time of his death. Also in 1911, Moscati became a member of the Royal Academy of Surgical Medicine, and received his doctorate in physiological chemistry. Moscati's bedroom, seen in 2015; the armchair is that in which he died Besides his work as a researcher and as a doctor, Moscati was responsible for overseeing the directions of the local Institute of Anatomical Pathology. In the institute's autopsy room, he placed a crucifix inscribed with Chapter 13, verse 14 of the Book of Hosea, Ero mors tua, o mors (O death, I will be thy death). The doctor's mother died of diabetes in 1914; as a consequence, Moscati became one of the first Neapolitan doctors to experiment with insulin in his treatment of the disease. During World War I, Moscati tried to enroll in the armed forces, but was rejected; military authorities felt that he could better serve the country by treating the wounded. His hospital was taken over by the military, and he himself visited close to 3,000 soldiers. In 1919, he was made director of one of the local men's schools; he also continued to teach. In 1922 Moscati was given a libera docenza in clinical medicine, which allowed him to teach at institutes of higher education. Death St Giuseppe Moscati's grave, in Ges√π Nuovo church. Moscati died in the afternoon of 12 April 1927. He had attended Mass that morning, receiving Communion as he always did, and spent the remainder of the morning at the hospital. Upon returning home he busied himself with patients until around three, after which, feeling tired, he sat down in an armchair in his office; soon after this, he died. Moscati's body was initially buried in the cemetery of Poggio Reale, but three years later was exhumed and reinterred in the church of Ges√π Nuovo. Today a marble stone marks his grave. Faith Plaque in memory of Giuseppe Moscati affixed to the building in which he lived in Naples. Moscati remained true to his faith his entire life, taking a vow of chastity and practicing charity in his daily work. He viewed his practice of medical science as a way of alleviating suffering, not as a way of making profits, and would retire regularly for prayer. He also attended Mass daily, and would sometimes use a patient's faith, as well as the sacraments, in his treatments. Moscati also refused to charge the poor for their treatment, and was known to sometimes send a patient home with a prescription and a 50-lira note in an envelope. It was claimed even before his death that Moscati was a miracle-worker; some said that he could accurately diagnose and prescribe for any patient merely by hearing a list of his symptoms, and that he was responsible for impossible cures. Reports of his good works continued well after his death, with further reports that he interceded in impossible cases. Consequently, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 November 1975.Solenne rito di beatificazione di Guiseppe Moscati vatican.va, Article in Italian Moscati was canonized on 25 October 1987, by Pope John Paul II. His canonization miracle involved the case of a young ironworker dying of leukemia. The young man's mother dreamed of a doctor wearing a white coat, whom she identified as Moscati when shown a photograph. Not long after this, her son went into remission and returned to work. Moscati was the first modern doctor to be canonized; his feast day is 16 November.  Television film  In 2007, Italy's Rai Uno presented the TV film St. Giuseppe Moscati: Doctor to the Poor directed by Giacomo Campiotti. The film is based on testimonies of contemporaries of Moscati who knew him, and describes his life between his university graduation in 1903 and his death in 1927.

Conductive textiles can be made with metal strands woven into the construction of the textile or by conductive yarns which are conductive thanks to a metal-coating. There is also an interest in semiconducting textiles, made by impregnating normal textiles with carbon- or metal-based powders. Conductive fibers consist of a non-conductive or less conductive substrate, which is then either coated or embedded with electrically conductive elements, often carbon, nickel, copper, gold, silver, titanium or PEDOT. Metals may be deposited chemically with autocatalytic chemistry, printed with conductive nanoparticle inks, or applied with physical vapor deposition methods. Substrates typically include cotton, polyester, nylon, and stainless steel to high performance fibers such as aramids and PBO. Straddling the worlds of textiles and wires, conductive fibers are sold either by weight or length, and measured in denier or AWG. Because of the rapid growth in the kinds of conductive fibers and the uses of these fibers, a trade association--the Conductive Fiber Manufacturers Council\\\\--was formed to increase awareness, utilization, and possibly standardize terminology. Applications Carbon tape Taser-proof vest on Instructables Uses for conductive fibers and textiles may include static dissipation, EMI shielding,http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/48_13_47.pdf signal and power transfer in low resistance versions, and as a heating element in higher resistance versions. Their benefits over solid or stranded metal wires come from conductive fibers' flexibility and ability to use them in existing textile and wire machinery (weaving, knitting, braiding, etc.). One major use is by Micro Coax's ARACON‚Ñ¢ fiber built on a KEVLAR¬Æ base, and used for shielding cabling in air- and spacecraft and other specialty purposes where light weight, high strength, and high-frequency shielding is imperative. Another more recent use is in the production of 'stun gun' or Taser-proof clothing, where the conductive textile forms a flexible Faraday cage in a layer of the garment. Conductive fabric can also be used to make electrodes for EEG and other medical applications; such electrodes were used in a commercially available sleep-monitoring device made by former company Zeo, Inc. Highly conductive stainless steel fiber is available.https://books.google.com/books?id=6GRovXHas_MC&pg;=PA993&lpg;=PA993&dq;=Highly+conductive+stainless+steel+fiber&source;=bl&ots;=FNRAz-4vrn&sig;=Kf8yNYiUme85vPhrclGYhFKLlns&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=wlexU7DXJIKp0QW_sYGIAg&ved;=0CDcQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q;=Highly%20conductive%20stainless%20steel%20fiber&f;=false Skotheim, Terje A.

Males are up to 4 mm long, females can reach up to 6 mm. Both sexes have very long legs (especially the second pair can reach up to 5 cm), with a distinct elongated apophysis that reaches almost to the end of the tibia. This makes their pedipalps look forked. Their body is brownish with dark markings, the females being lighter colored. D. ramosus from Leverkusen, Germany The forked pedipalps and the resting posture, with the legs stretched to the sides, makes this species easy to identify, although the traditional method of collecting invertebrates does not prove adequate: of 103 individuals captured in Belgium, only one was found in a pitfall; all others were collected by hand. Adults can be found from August to November, mostly in gardens and on outer walls, but sometimes also inside. Distribution Originally the species was found in Morocco. Later it spread into Europe, with first reports in Portugal (1948), where it spread to Spain (1965) and France (1969). The Netherlands were reached in 1992. Since 2004 it is known to occur in Germany. As early as 1957, it was reported in Bournemouth, southern England, from where it spread all over the island, reaching Scotland in 2000. In 2010, one occurrence in Denmark was documented. The very similar and closely related D. gasteinensis is found in the Alps. References * (1997). Kosmos-Atlas Spinnentiere Europas.

She was the victim of a violent robbery and rape in 1986 at a vicarage in Ealing, London, a crime for which the perpetrators' relatively lenient sentences led indirectly to changes in the law. Saward was the first rape victim in Britain to waive her right to anonymity. Background Saward was educated at Lady Margaret School in London. Her father, Reverend Michael Saward, became the vicar of St Mary's, Ealing, in 1978. She married Gavin Drake, and the couple lived in Hednesford, Staffordshire, with their three sons. Ealing vicarage rape=Attack On 6 March 1986, a gang of burglars broke into the Saward family's home at lunchtime. Jill's father and her then-boyfriend, David Kerr, were tied up and beaten, both suffering fractured skulls, while she was raped.\\"Why I am the real victim of the Ealing vicarage rape\\", Daily Mail, 3 August 1998. The incident received considerable international media coverage because the house was identified as that of the vicar of Ealing, and the attack was soon labelled by the media as the \\"Ealing vicarage rape\\". Saward was effectively identified as the victim of the attack by photographs published in The Sun four days later. Trial and sentences At the trial of the perpetrators in 1987, the judge, John Leonard, gave those responsible longer sentences for the burglary than for the rape, stating: \\"Because I have been told the trauma suffered by the victim was not so great, I shall take a lenient course with you\\". The leader of the three men, Robert Horscroft, who was not involved in the rape, received 14 years' imprisonment for burglary and assault. Martin McCall, the more violent of the two attackers, was sentenced to five years for rape and five years for aggravated burglary, while Christopher Byrne received three years for rape and five years for burglary and assault. The sentence was criticised by senior British politicians of the time, including then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and opposition leader Neil Kinnock, while others complained that property was being valued more highly than a human body. Saward too complained about the sentences; in 1988, as a result of the case, a new law was passed that allowed appeals against unduly lenient sentences, and also closed a loophole that had previously only granted rape victims anonymity after a suspect was charged with the offence. Criminologist Anthony Bottoms described the case as \\"a particularly striking example of some fault lines deeply embedded within the institutional structures of the English sentencing processes\\" of the time. On his retirement in 1993, Leonard publicly apologised to Saward, saying his judgment at the trial was a \\"blemish ‚Äì I make no bones about it\\". Subsequent developments Four days after the incident, The Sun published a photograph of Saward with just her eyes blacked out, as well as an image of her home on its front page, jeopardising her anonymity. The newspaper's editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, said he printed the images because a rape victim only earned the right to anonymity once a suspect had been charged with the offence. This led to the Press Council amending its guidelines and the closure of that legal loophole. In 1990, with the help of friend Wendy Green, Saward wrote a book about her experiences, called Rape: My Story. At the same time she featured in an Everyman programme for the BBC with Jenni Murray.BFI.org In doing so, she became the first British rape victim to waive her right to anonymity. The documentary was used to educate judges about the trauma suffered by rape victims. Originally published in The Observer Magazine, 13 December 1992. In 1998, Saward met Horscroft, the leader of the gang but who had not been involved in the rape, and reportedly forgave him for his role in the crime. Horscroft had been freed in 1996; he died in 2012. Saward told Elizabeth Grice in an interview for The Daily Telegraph in 2006: \\"Of course, sometimes I thought it might be quite nice to be full of hatred and revenge. But I think it creates a barrier and you're the one who gets damaged in the end. So, although it makes you vulnerable, forgiving is actually a release. I don't think I'd be here today without my Christian faith. That's what got me through\\". Campaigning work In 1988, Saward moved from London to the West Midlands where she initially worked as a teaching assistant at a school in Birmingham.Report by Mark Andrews. From 1990, until her death, Saward worked in various roles to support victims of rape and sexual violence. In 1994, she set up a support group for rape victims and their families, and also helped to campaign for a change in the law that prevented people accused of rape from cross-examining their alleged victims.https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/09/jill-saward-obituary In a Channel 5 interview and a Daily Mail article, she argued in 1997 that men in date rape cases should be tried of a lesser offence. \\"I do [not] suggest the hypothetical victim is culpable,\\" she commented, \\"only that she did nothing to help herself\\". Feminists responded negatively. In 2009, she campaigned against a European Court of Justice ruling that the DNA of people cleared of crimes must be deleted from the DNA Database after six years, or 12 years for serious crimes. In 2015, she spoke out against a proposal for rape suspects to remain anonymous until they are charged, describing it as \\"really insulting to victims and a really disappointing move\\" and sending a \\"damaging message\\" when it was proposed as part of the coalition agreement for the 2010 Parliament. In 2014, Saward co-founded the JURIES (Jurors Understanding Rape Is Essential Standard) campaign with Alison Boydell, seeking to make it mandatory for jurors in sexual abuse and rape trials to be informed about \\"the myths, stereotypes and realities\\" concerning those issues. Explaining the goal of the campaign, Saward wrote: \\"We envisage this being done by a DVD that is played in open court that addresses some of the most common myths. Many victims are not getting justice because jurors believe incorrect information that is prejudicial to their thinking, before any evidence is heard. Currently rape myths can be addressed, but only after the evidence is heard. This is too late.\\" In January 2015, Saward debated the campaign's goals with Helen Reece, Professor in Law at the London School of Economics, on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. In 2016, Saward criticised the Crown Prosecution Service's dealing with rape cases, saying: \\"I think the issues a lot of people have is the length of time it takes the CPS to get a case to court.\\" Politics Saward stood against David Davis in the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election. She criticised Davis for \\"saying nothing at all\\" about sexual violence issues while serving as Shadow Home Secretary, and stated that the DNA Database should be extended to help detection of sexual assault. In her view, there was a disparity between the \\"thousands\\" of people affected by sexual assault each year, compared to the detention proposals of the Counter-Terrorism Bill \\"which may not affect anybody at all\\" and felt that \\"somebody needs to get the issue of rape on to the agenda\\". On the issue of detaining suspects for up to 42 days, she told Julie Bindel: \\"If the police say they need more time to work on these cases, then I support them\\". Asked about the effects on the Asian community: \\"It will target people who are seen to be a threat to our nation's freedom. At the moment, that might be some Muslim men, 10 years ago it was the IRA ‚Äî so people with Irish accents were the target ‚Äî and soon it could be Mugabe's men\\". In the by-election Saward received 492 votes (2.1%). Death Jill Saward died on 5 January 2017, in New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, following a subarachnoid hemorrhage two days earlier. She died nine days before her 52nd birthday.

The locomotive was built at Eastleigh Works in June 1942 in its original air-smoothed form, and given the number 21C9. One of a batch of eight Merchant Navy class locomotives whose air-smoothed casing was made of asbestos board, 21C9 was from the start in wartime black livery. It was allocated to Salisbury shed.Mannion, p. 123 Between 1945 and 1947 the Merchant Navy class were repainted in Malachite green livery, with yellow lining. 21C9 was one of several in a variant of this livery, in which the smokebox cowls were painted green instead of black.Mannion, p. 74 Shaw Savill was repainted in British Railways blue livery in August 1949, and in Brunswick Green in February 1953.Mannion, p. 201 Between 1956 and 1960 locomotives of the Merchant Navy class were rebuilt and the air-smoothed casing removed. Shaw Savill was rebuilt in March 1957,Mannion, p. 197 withdrawn from service in July 1964 and arrived at Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, in December 1964. At the time of withdrawal it had travelled 1,127,452 miles.Mannion, p. 205 Some time after 1984, the locomotive left Barry for preservation on the Mid Hants Railway (Watercress Line). It spent just over 4 years there but with the Mid Hants railway buying more locos it was decided to move 35009 Shaw Savill again, to Bury. By late 2009, Shaw Savill lay dismantled at Buckley Wells shed in Bury. Its current owner Ian Riley had previously offered the locomotive for sale. By 2019 Shaw Savill was still in unrestored condition following years of storage outside the shed in Bury, in September it was announced that the engine was to be restored to working order. The engines frames, boiler and other parts were moved to Riley & Son Ltd in Heywood for restoration to mainline standard.

French Revolutionary Wars On 4 April 1796, Ramilies ran down and sank the hired armed lugger Spider while maneuvering. In 1801, Ramilies was part of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's reserve squadron at the Battle of Copenhagen, and so did not take an active part in the battle. Expedition to occupy the Danish West Indies (1807) In 1807 Ramillies was in the West Indies as part of a squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, who sailed in HMS Belleisle. The squadron, which included HMS Prince George, HMS Northumberland, HMS Canada and HMS Cerberus, captured the Telemaco, Carvalho and Master on 17 April 1807. Following the concern in Britain that neutral Denmark was entering an alliance with Napoleon, in December Ramillies participated in Cochrane's expedition that captured the Danish islands of St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December. The Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. War of 1812 In August 1812, Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy took command of Ramillies and was sent to North America at the outbreak of the War of 1812. Hardy led the fleet in Ramillies that escorted and transported the army commanded by John Coape Sherbrooke which captured significant portions of eastern coastal Maine (then part of Massachusetts), including Fort Sullivan, Eastport, Machias, Bangor, and Castine. On 4 December 1813 Ramilies and Loire recaptured the whaler , J.Bowman, master, which the United States Navy had captured in the South Pacific. Her captors sent Policy into Halifax, Nova Scotia. However, on 10 August 1814, a landing party from Ramillies was defeated at Stonington, Connecticut. The party was to have burned Stonington Borough and the shipping, but was repulsed. During the Battle of North Point, a composite battalion of Royal Marines were landed from HMS , HMS Ramillies, HMS Albion, and HMS Royal Oak, under the command of Brevet Major John Robyns.Crawford, p273 with reference to Rear Admiral Codrington's memo dated 11 September 1814 The two fatalities were from HMS Ramillies. Post-war In June 1815 Ramillies was under the command of Captain Charles Ogle. In November, Captain Thomas Boys replaced Ogle, while Rear-Admiral Sir William Hope raised his flag in her at Leith.Winfield (2008), pp.60-1. In June 1818 Ramillies was at Sheerness, being fitted as a guardship. Captain Aiskew Hollis took command in September as Ramillies took up a post as guardship at Portsmouth. While at Portsmouth she employed a HMS Viper as a tender. On 30 November 1820 and 6 February 1821, Viper made some captures, presumably of smugglers, that resulted in a payment of prize money not only to the officers and crew of Viper, but also of Ramillies. In August 1821, Ramillies came under the command of Captain Edward Brace and served in the Downs on the Coastal Blockade. She then underwent repairs between May 1822 and June 1823, and was fitted for a guardship at Portsmouth again. In May 1823 Captain William M'Cullock took command. In November 1825 Captain Hugh Pigot replaced M'Cullock. The Admiralty ordered Ramillies to the Reserve for Harbour Service in 1830, and Ramillies was on harbour service from 1831. In June 1831 Ramillies was at Chatham Dockyard, being fitted as a lazaretto, a hospital for quarantine. She then moved to Sheerness to serve in that capacity. Ramillies was eventually broken up at Sheerness in February 1850. Footnotes Notes Citations References * Crawford, Michael J. (Ed) (2002). The Naval War of 1812: A Documentary History, Vol. 3.

He is shown wearing a tunic, cloak, and hose. Anglo-Saxon dress refers to the clothing and accessories worn by the Anglo-Saxons from the middle of the 5th century to the eleventh century. Archaeological finds in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries have provided the best source of information on Anglo- Saxon costume. It is possible to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon dress using archaeological evidence combined with Anglo-Saxon and European art, writing and literature of the time period. Archaeological finds have both supported and contradicted the characteristic Anglo-Saxon costume as illustrated and described by these contemporary sources. The collective evidence of cemetery grave-goods indicates that men's and women's costume was not alike. Women's dress changed frequently from century to century, while men's dress changed very little. Women typically wore jewellery, men wore little or no jewellery. The beginning of the seventh century marked the conversion of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to Christianity. Religious art, symbols and writings from the conversion years greatly influenced costume fashion from this period onward, especially's women's dress and jewellery. Historical research has shown that Anglo-Saxon children wore smaller versions of adult garments. Clothing worn by the military, the elite class and religious orders was initially similar to the daily garments of the common man and woman. Over time, and with the influence of European culture, the spread of Christianity and the increasing prosperity of Anglo-Saxon England, garments and accessories specific to each group became the standard by which they were identified. During the Anglo- Saxon era, textiles were created from natural materials: wool from sheep, linen from flax and imported silk. In the fifth and sixth centuries, women were the manufacturers of clothing, weaving textiles on looms in their individual dwellings. In the seventh to ninth centuries, Anglo-Saxon communities changed slowly from primarily small settlements to a mix of small and large settlements, and large estates. Specialized workshops on large landholdings were responsible for the manufacture of textiles and clothing for the estate community. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the growth of urban centres throughout England expanded the variety and quantity of textiles, clothing, and accessories that were made available to the public and also changed the way in which clothing and accessories were manufactured. Overview: Anglo-Saxon England=Anglo-Saxon timeline Anglo-Saxon migration map The end of Roman rule in Britain led to the withdrawal of the Roman armies in the late fourth and early fifth century. By the mid-fifth century, an influx of Germanic peoples arrived in England, many leaving overcrowded native lands in Northwestern Europe and others fleeing rising sea levels on the North Sea coast. The middle of the fifth century marked the beginning of the Anglo-Saxon era in England. The Anglo-Saxon era consists of three different time periods: The early Anglo-Saxon era, which spans the mid- fifth to the beginning of the seventh century; the middle Anglo-Saxon era, which covers the seventh thru the ninth centuries; and the late Anglo-Saxon era, which includes the tenth and eleventh centuries. Anglo-Saxon identity In Anglo-Saxon England, clothing and accessories were used to establish identity of gender, age, ethnicity, regionality, occupation and status. Initially, the early migrants to England displayed their Germanic identity through their choices in clothing and accessories. Later, Anglo-Saxon dress was shaped by European costume styles, as well as European art and religious emblems of Christianity. A person's identity as a believer in Christianity was manifested through dress. Cross-shaped designs appear on Kentish disc brooches as early as the late sixth century. Tiny crosses also start appearing on shoulder clasps and on Kentish belt buckles in the seventh century. Clothing and accessories varied from the functional, the recycled, the symbolic, the elegant, the opulent and the elaborate. Commoners typically possessed one main garment, which they wore daily. Their clothes were often recycled from older, out-of-style clothing and handed-down items. Higher- status individuals typically owned multiple items of clothing and accessories, often made with high-quality and expensive materials, and decorated in intricate detail. The archaeological record Assembly of grave artefacts, grave #2166, Milton Keynes Archaeological finds in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries have provided the best source of information on Anglo-Saxon dress. Pagan burial practices in the early Anglo-Saxon era included placing grave-goods with the clothed body. Archaeological excavations from this era have provided a rich supply of artefacts that have been analysed and compared to contemporary Anglo-Saxon and European art, writing and literature in order to reconstruct a standard Anglo-Saxon costume. Archaeological evidence for female burials is abundant in the fifth and the sixth centuries. The cemetery evidence for male burials is limited compared to female burials, with primarily belt buckles and other belt fittings and a few pins. The beginning of the seventh century marked the decline of the pagan tradition of including grave-goods in burials. This change in funerary practice coincided with the Christianisation of Anglo- Saxon England. Beginning in the eighth century, grave-goods, except for simple items like knives and belts, were no longer included with individual burials. This lack of costume artefacts makes it more challenging for historians and archaeologists to determine what Anglo-Saxons were wearing during the eighth to the eleventh centuries. Archaeological evidence from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries have alternately supported and contradicted contemporary illustrations of Anglo-Saxon costume. For example, there are burial finds of finger rings, some engraved with names, in both male and female graves; finger rings never appear in Anglo-Saxon illustrations. Alternately, the penannular brooch, arm-rings and neck-rings that show up occasionally in Anglo-Saxon art are not supported by any finds from Anglo-Saxon cemetery excavations. Women's costume=Fifth to sixth centuries Reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon woman's attire Fifth and sixth century women's costume has been reconstructed by scholars, based on the archaeological evidence of brooches worn in pairs at the shoulders. Researchers continue to fill current gaps of knowledge about female dress during this time period. The female gown is presumed to be ankle-length (women in Anglo-Saxon art and later in medieval art are usually represented in long garments). Currently, there is no archaeological evidence to support this belief. Experiments to recreate early Anglo-Saxon female dress have resulted in the creation of a female costume which includes a long under-gown, with a buckled belt which holds suspended items including knives, keys, amulets, and weaving tools. The long gown is covered with a short peplos, which could be easily hitched up to reach the tools. The age of a woman often designated the costume that would be her daily dress. Dress and accessories, specifically the peplos, the pin, a belt or girdle with tools and keys, was relevant to a woman's age and state of life, especially to the child-bearing years and marriage. The peplos was typically worn starting in the teen years and continually worn until a woman was in her forties, past childbearing age. This long garment, with its paired shoulder brooches, was a comfortable garment for breastfeeding and could expand easily when a woman was pregnant. Though most finds are long, it has sometimes been interpreted as possible to wear a short one. Although the peplos was traditionally worn starting in the teens, archaeological evidence indicates that girls as young as eight years old, wore the peplos, but marked their younger age by fastening their gowns with one brooch instead of two. Beginning in the fifth century, women in Kent wore a slightly different costume, influenced by fashions from the Frankish Empire, than women from other regions of Anglo-Saxon England. The costume consisted of a front-fastening garment and a Frankish-inspired front-fastening jacket, which was attached by four brooches. In the last third of the sixth century in Kent, women's dresses were fastened by an ornate disk brooch at the throat, replacing \\"the coat-based costume fastened by four brooches in two matched pair sets down the length of the coat.\\" There were other regional variations of women's dress, notably in Anglian areas, where wrist clasps and a third, central brooch and distinctive 'girdle-hangers' were the norm. Women's costume throughout England was enhanced by beads made of glass, paste and amber and less frequently, crystal. Garlands of beads were typically suspended between the shoulder brooches, and other bead clusters often hung from brooches, attached to girdles and were sometimes worn on their own. =Main garment= An archangel expels Adam and Eve from Paradise, C√¶dmon Manuscript, c. 1000. The typical women's costume of this era was a long peplos-like garment, pulled up to the armpit and worn over a sleeved under-garment, usually another dress. The garment was clasped front to back by fastening brooches at the shoulders. Anglo-Saxon women in this period may or may not have worn a head covering. The dress could be belted or girdled, and easily adjusted to changes in the woman's weight. It is unknown what the Anglo-Saxons called the peplos-style gown. Linen or wool could be used to make the peplos garment. There has been discussion among historians of whether a preference of one fibre over the other was a matter of fashion changes over time or related to regional differences. Fashion changes tended to begin in eastern England, reflecting contemporary fashion styles in Europe, and those changes would move slowly over time to the West Saxon region. Survival of fur is rare in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. It is likely that fleeces and furs were used as garment lining or as warm outer garments. Anglo-Saxon textile and clothing historian, Penelope Walton-Rogers, has recently identified buckled capes of animal pelt that were found in Anglo-Saxon women's graves. A simple poncho made with a neck-opening for the head could have been made from skins of domesticated sheep or cattle. Literary evidence confirms the use of fur garments, primarily in the late Anglo-Saxon period. =Accessories= Evidence of footwear from early Anglo- Saxon graves is rare until the late sixth and seventh centuries. Agricultural labourers shown ploughing and sowing in Anglo-Saxon illustrated manuscripts work barefoot, which may indicate that footwear was not the norm until the middle Anglo-Saxon era. Clothing fasteners made of organic material are rare finds, although archaeological evidence from urban settlements has shown that Anglo-Saxons were skilled at working organic material, including bone, horn, antler and wood. Evidence shows that the skin of cattle, deer, goat, pig and sheep were used to make leather goods. Although only tiny remnants of leather survive, they are usually attached to buckles and to wrist clasps. Leather was probably used to make belts, suspension straps, and cuffs, although cloth was also used to make those items. Seventh to ninth centuries Along with the spread of Christianity in seventh century England, religious art and European fashion inspired changes in women's dress. These changes were marked by the disappearance of the paired brooch, aside from very small annular and penannular brooches; occasional elaborate, round brooches were also worn individually. Linked pins appeared during the seventh century. There were fewer bead ornaments than before, and amber largely disappeared during this time period. =Main garment= Changes in Anglo-Saxon women's dress began in the latter half of the sixth century in Kent and spread to other regions at the beginning of the seventh century. These fashion changes show the decreasing influence of Northern Europe and the increasing influence of the Frankish Kingdom and the Byzantine Empire and a revival of Roman culture. Linen is used more widely for garments and under-garments. Although there is little evidence to show whether women wore leggings or stockings under their gowns, it is more than likely that these leg-coverings were worn, as men typically wore stocking and leggings during this period. =Accessories= During this period, women's jewellery, besides brooches used to fasten clothing, consisted of simple neck ornaments of small glass beads or strands of beads hung on metal rings, strung from shoulder to shoulder over garments. This fashion remained in place until the late seventh century. This era is noticeable for the decline of the paired brooch fashion. Amethyst beads started appearing at this time, along with necklaces of gold and silver wire, and, as a symbol of being Christian, small jewelled crosses. Occasionally, elaborate, round brooches were worn at the throat. Linked pins were now appearing among grave-goods. There were fewer bead ornaments than before, and amber was no longer used. Tenth and eleventh centuries The Virgin Mary in Anglo-Saxon dress, New Minster Charter, 966 In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the growth of cities throughout England expanded the variety and quantity of textiles, clothing, and accessories that were made available to Anglo-Saxon women. Textiles and accessories could be mass-produced making these items more affordable. For more affluent women, finer materials and more opulent clothing and jewellery were easily obtainable. =Overgarment= Many names for cloak appear during this time period, including , , and . A symmetrical cloak draped around the shoulders and fastened with a brooch is fashionable in this period, but is declining in popularity. Hooded cloaks attached by a circular brooch are described in the literature of this time period. =Main garment= Women wearing a sleeveless overgarment, with or without hood, can be seen in artistic representations of this time period. Women in late Anglo-Saxon art are depicted wearing hooded garments: either a scarf wrapped around the head and neck or an unconnected head covering with an opening for the face. It was assumed that the hooded style was influenced by Near Eastern art. Women are shown wearing ankle-length, tailored gowns. Gowns are often depicted with a distinct border, sometimes in a contrasting colour. In the tenth century, women's arms are typically covered. Sleeves are seen as straight, with a slight flair at the end. Braided or embroidered borders often decorated sleeves. By the eleventh century, multiple sleeve styles had come into fashion. There is little evidence to show whether women wore leggings or stockings under their gowns in the tenth and the eleventh centuries, although it probable that these clothing items were worn, as men typically wore stocking and leggings during this period. =Accessories= The girdles and buckled belts that were popular in the fifth and sixth century, with tools and personal items suspended from the belt, have gone out of fashion by the tenth century. In the art of this period, women wear simple ankle shoes and slippers, usually black in colour, but with a contrasting strip of colour on the top of the shoe. Archaeological finds of this period demonstrate that a variety of women's shoe styles were being worn.  Men's costume  Anglo- Saxon burial excavations have uncovered little evidence of what men wore during this period. Weapons were often buried with men, but dress accessories were less likely to be found except for belt buckles. The lack of fasteners and brooches in male graves resulted in few textile remnants of men's clothing. The few textile fragments that have been found, fortunately were found in good condition for analysis. To reconstruct men's costume from the Anglo-Saxon period, a review can be made of the writing, art and archaeological finds in north-western Europe and Scandinavia from previous centuries and during the Anglo-Saxon era. Romans in the second century described the use of fur and skin garments among the Germanic tribes. With the introduction of the warp-weighted loom in (c. 200 AD), wool clothing would have been available for men and may have replaced or diminished the reliance and fur and skin garments. Fifth to sixth centuries 4th century Germanic tunic found on Thorsberg moor =Overgarment= Anglo-Saxon men of 5th and 6th century England dressed alike regardless of social rank. The fashions during this time consisted of the cloak, tunic, trousers, leggings, and accessories. Short textile-made cloaks are seen on Roman sculptures of Germanic captives. It has been determined that cloaks were composed of cloth and clasped on one shoulder. Men wearing similarly styled cloaks, clasped with circular brooches, occur in late era Anglo-Saxon drawings and paintings. It is probable that this style of clothing was worn by Germanic tribes on the continent and later when they migrated to England. Male burial artefacts from the fifth to the seventh centuries rarely include brooches; any metalwork uncovered have usually been pins found in the chest area of the body. It is likely that men in this period used brooches made of perishable material, secured their cloaks with leather or cloth laces, covered themselves with cloaks without using clasps, or used poncho-style cloaks. Because of the lack of Anglo-Saxon male burial finds, archaeologist have looked to earlier period writings from Europe and earlier century finds from Scandinavian peat bogs to predict what Anglo-Saxon men might have worn. It is probable that a short, fur-lined cloak was used with the skin of the animal faced outward and the fur brushed against the undergarments. =Main garment= Roman writers and sculpture of Germanic men depict knee-length or shorter tunics with either short or long sleeves. Clasps were not needed to hold the tunic together because when pulled over the head it would sit snugly around the neck without the use of lacing or ties, indicating that the garment was one continuous piece. A belt or girdle was usually worn with the tunic and might have had a buckle, and, as Anglo-Saxon historian, Gale Owen-Crocker states, \\"pouched over the belt\\". Historians are reasonably confident that Anglo-Saxon men wore trousers. The Roman poet Ovid described the wearing of trousers by Germanic barbarians. Ankle-length trousers are also seen on Roman sculptures of Germanic men, often with a short tunic, tied around the waist with a belt or draped with a cloak. It is probable that Anglo-Saxon men wore either baggy or narrow trousers, belted at the waist and possibly attached to the legs with either garters or leggings. If loose, the excess material was bunched around the waist and, as Owen-Crocker describes, \\"hung in folds around the legs\\". Garters or leggings probably accompanied narrow trousers. =Leggings and footwear= Leg-garments, or leggings were usually worn in pairs; these items served as additional protection for the legs. Linguistic documents from this era reveal that early Anglo-Saxon males wore two types of leg-garments. The first type of leggings would have been a leather or cloth stocking; the second type was most likely cloth strips or wool tied around the leg. Binding strips to the legs had the added benefit of being able to wind the cloth around or cover the foot for extra warmth and protection. Footwear has not been found in Anglo-Saxon graveyards in the fifth to sixth centuries. It is likely that Anglo-Saxons, especially agricultural labourers, went barefoot, although linguistic documentation has revealed that there were several shoe types in circulation during this time period: slippers, raw-hide pampooties and pouch- like foot coverings. Anglo-Saxons most likely covered their bare feet, except when working. Shoes presumably would have been made of leather and secured with straps. Hats and hoods were commonly worn, as were gloves and mittens. =Accessories= The only male accessory frequently found in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries is belt hardware. Men's belt hardware tended to be more elaborate than women's belt hardware. Leather remnants have been discovered in male graves attached to buckles, which makes it more than likely that leather belts were a common clothing accessory. Men usually carried a knife, other tools, and sometimes amulets at the waist. Jewellery was found in very few male graves of this period. Some beads have been uncovered in some male burial sites and may have been decorated a belt or weapon. Anglo-Saxon literary evidence from this time period suggest that men frequently wore rings, but there have been very few rings discovered in Anglo-Saxon male graves. Seventh to ninth centuries This era marked the disappearance of furnished graves, but also saw the installation of some of the wealthiest male burials of the Anglo-Saxon era. The best example is the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which is dated to the early 7th century. It has been determined to be the burial of a king. Writings of an eighth century historian, Paulus Catena, describe Germanic peoples inhabiting the Italian Peninsula during this time period, \\"Indeed their clothes were roomy and especially linen, as the Anglo- Saxons were accustomed to have, embellished with rather wide borders woven in various colours\\" Paulus's description of Anglo-Saxon wearing linen is confirmed by eighth century writers, Bede and Aldhelm. Linen was likely the favoured fabric over wool for garments worn in eighth century Anglo-Saxon England. There are several clothing references in seventh and eighth century letters. Letters between King Offa of Mercia and the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne demonstrate that clothing in Anglo-Saxon England was similar to Carolignian Frankia. This costume has been described as a short tunic over linen shirt and linen drawers with long stockings. In winter, a cloak was worn over the costume. 8th century Franks Casket depicting Anglo-Saxon dress =Overgarment= Cloak of this period, included the cloak style seen on the Franks Casket, made with rectangular cloth, and fastened so the cloak appeared to be pleated or folded, and held together at the right shoulder with a brooch. Once in place, the brooch was left attached to the garment so that the cloak was slipped over the head. Ninth century art shows a few different styles of cloak: hooded, non-hooded with a frilled collar, and the pleated cloaks arranged over the shoulders and bound at the waist by a belt. These belts were narrower than earlier in the Saxon period, with fewer tools hanging from them. The wrap-over coat made an appearance during this era. This knee- length coat wrapped over the front of the body. Its sleeves were, as Owen- Crocker says, \\"deep, [with] decorated cuffs which [were] mostly straight\\". The cloaks of common men were simple and less decorated than cloaks of wealthier men. =Main garment= Human figures start to appear in art during this period. Most of the male figures displayed in Anglo-Saxon art wear short, above-the-knee, girdled tunics. Short tunics were most commonly worn, but longer tunics are seen on Anglo-Saxon sculpture. Eighth century writer Aldhelm describes a linen shirt worn under a tunic. Other contemporary writings describe the use of undergarments. It is possible that loin cloths were used as undergarment or on its own if a tunic was not worn. Trousers continued to be worn by men. Traditionally worn under a short tunic or with a small cloak, they were typically ankle length. The jacket appeared during this time as well. For those who could afford it, the jacket was made of fur while less costly ones were made of linen. This jacket was waist-length and tended to have a broad collar. =Leggings and footwear= Leggings and stockings continued to be worn in the seventh to the ninth centuries. Frankish fashion for elaborate gartering was very popular in the seventh century. From the beginning of the seventh century, shoes become more abundant as burial artefacts. A burial site at Banstead Downs uncovered a male skeleton with soft leather ankle-boots which included eyelets for leather thongs. This boot style is similar to archaeological finds for the same period in York. =Accessories and jewellery= Archaeological finds indicate that the belt continued to be used in Anglo-Saxon male costume in the seventh to the ninth centuries. Knives were often suspended from belts and in the early seventh century, leather sheaves started to appear with knives. Leather and fabric pouches make their initial appearance during this time period. Many of the buckles were simple and small, although more elaborate and opulent buckles have been discovered. Kent burials include a number of large, triangular belt buckles from male graves. The conversion of Anglo-Saxon England to Christianity is demonstrated in the appearance of buckles with the cross symbols and fish emblem. As seen on the St. Mary Bishophill sculpture in York of two Anglo-Saxon men, horns could be suspended from the belt. Brooches have been rare in archaeological finds for this period, but it is probable that disc-headed pins and other pins were worn by men as they have been found in Anglo-Saxon settlements. The quoit brooch is a very early type. Disc brooches such as the Harford Farm Brooch appear in Anglo-Saxon art at the beginning of the seventh century, but have not been discovered as archaeological finds in male graves. At the beginning of the ninth century, gold was scarce, and was rarely found on brooches. Brooches were typically created with base metal or silver; the Fuller Brooch and Strickland Brooch are both in silver, as is the Anglo-Scandinavian √Üdwen's brooch. The ninth century initiated elaborate finger-rings into Anglo-Saxon fashion. Gloves were commonly used in Anglo- Saxon England by the beginning of the eighth century. Falconers wore gloves and depictions of gloves have been found on Anglo-Saxon sculpture. Archaeological evidence has shown that elaborate gloves made with fine material have been found in Europe. This quality and styling of gloves could have easily migrated to England. Tenth and eleventh centuries √Üthelstan presenting a gospel book to St Cuthbert (934) The literary, linguistic and artistic evidence of the tenth and eleventh centuries reveals many examples of male fashion. There are a variety of costumes depicted, shorter garments for the average male and longer garments for elite individuals. Different occupations and functions, like farming, hunting, and soldiering required different styles of clothing. =Overgarment= Cloaks were worn indoors and outdoors and covered both short and long garments. Cloaks were rectangular or square in shape, attached with a brooch and not usually tailored. Circular brooches were the most common style brooches used by men at this time. =Main garment= The short tunic continues to be the standard garment of Anglo-Saxon men. They were usually knee-length, but sometimes worn at a shorter length. The tunic continues to be bound at the waist by a belt or girdle. It is most likely that the tunic fabric was joined at the sides, and the neck opening was probably tied by string, ribbon or cloth. Sleeves were believed to be either short or long, with longer sleeves more likely acting as an undergarment. Undergarments continue to be worn and are more detailed in decoration. Linen shirts or a garment similar to a nightgown could be worn under the main garment. =Leggings and footwear= Art from this period, including the Bayeux Tapestry indicate that men continued to wear leggings and stockings. Leg coverings often cover the shoes and probably covered the foot. The material was likely made of woven cloth as knitting would not be introduced in England until the sixteenth century. Excavations in late Anglo- Saxon and Anglo-Viking London, Winchester and York has produced many shoes: flat-soled, leather 'turn shoes' (made inside out and then turned), and thonged shoes. The most common type of shoe is the ankle-high shoe, but lower slippers and taller boots also have been found. Flat, black shoes with a white stripe on top are the typical male footwear seen in Anglo-Saxon art during this time period. =Accessories and jewellery= Knives, suspended from belts and girdles, no longer appear in Anglo-Saxon art of this period Brooches of the tenth and eleventh centuries are typically circular. The most opulent brooches are silver, others are base metal. Small, round brooches, worn as cloak fasteners, are often depicted on men in late Anglo-Saxon art. Other brooch types which have been uncovered in late Anglo-Saxon burial finds are not seen in Anglo-Saxon art during this time period. Children's costume Grave-goods identified as belonging to children are scarce in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. The little evidence suggests that children wore clothing that was similar to adults. Children's artefacts that have been found, include wrist and ankle bangles, neck-rings, small knives and beads. The most common accessory found in children's graves is the bead, worn individually or in small numbers. Both boys and girls could be buried with a belt buckle, although buckles were not typically worn until adulthood. Children's and adult's clothing show differences in the type of clothing material worn. A higher percentage of linen is found in children's graves compared to adult burials. Linen may have been preferable for children's garments, since it was much easier to wash repeatedly than wool. Illustrations and paintings from the sixth to eleventh centuries in England, always depict male children. They are usually seen in short tunics with shirts. Infants are portrayed in long gowns, and either wear no head covering or wear head covering similar to women of the period. Dress and status 7th century shoulder clasp for an Anglo-Saxon King The wealth of an Anglo-Saxon could be measured by the number and variety of garments, accessories, and jewellery he or she possessed and the quality of those items. Status in jewellery is reflected in size, intricacy, and use of gold, silver and garnet. Wealthier men and women owned footwear in the early Anglo-Saxon era, a period when many Anglo-Saxons were probably going barefoot. The affluent often had newer clothing and wore the latest fashions in clothing and accessories. Documentary evidence has shown that luxurious textiles were abundant in Anglo-Saxon England. These materials included imported silks, and textiles and clothing embroidered with gold. Most of these extravagant items were primarily used as religious garments, but it is also highly likely that royals and the wealthier members of Anglo-Saxon society owned opulent and expensive clothing. Fifth to seventh centuries Sutton Hoo belt buckle, 7th century Prosperity was marked by ownership of gold: buckles, brooches and gold embroidery or brocading on garments. Ornate buckles and clasps identified the wearer as important men of the seventh century. The jacket appeared during this time as well. For those who could afford it, the jacket was made of fur while less costly ones were made of linen. Pile woven cloaks, which probably imitated fur in their shaggy effect, were a high status alternative for men in the seventh century. The extremely affluent male buried AD 625 in the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial (mound 1) was supplied with two pairs of shoes, several yellow-dyed cloaks, and possible alternative sets of jewelled belt equipment. \\"The Sutton Hoo Mound 1 warrior can be characterized as equipped in the manner of a Roman general....His helmet is modelled ultimately on a fourth-century Roman cavalry parade helmet, his shield is similarly an oversized decorated parade item, and the gold and garnet decorated shoulder clasps probably fastened a leather tunic and imitate the epaulettes of Roman body armour. He also possessed a ring mail shirt, while a showy gold belt buckle and the garnet and gold fittings to his sword and sword belt help to complete the picture.\\" Eighth and ninth centuries Edgar I from the New Minster Charter, 966 Leggings were more elaborate from the seventh to the ninth centuries with Frankish dress fashion providing the inspiration. In wealthier graves of this time period, buckles could be found under the knees and ankles of skeletal remains. Lace remnants found near the legs of skeletons in Kent is another indication of Frankish influence in clothing. Art of this era was abundant in illustrations of English kings wearing long garments. The change from shorter tunics to long garments was likely influenced by European fashion. Gowns were often loose, with a variety of sleeve styles. Tenth and eleventh centuries Fur, which has been used in previous centuries to keep the body warm, was becoming more popular outside of England, In England, fur became more of a fashion choice as a luxury item during the tenth and eleventh centuries Military dress helmet Historian Gale Owen-Crocker, in her book, Dress in Anglo-Saxon England writes, \\"Despite allusions to mailcoats in the heroic poetry of the Anglo-Saxon period, the general absence of archaeological evidence for them, even in graves equipped with fine weapons, suggests that, at least in the earlier centuries of the Anglo-Saxon era, they were a rare luxury, and it was not unusual to fight without protective clothing; on the Franks Casket some spear-carriers are not equipped with armour\\". Burial finds from the fourth or early fifth century in Oxfordshire (prior to the Anglo-Saxon migration) have found evidence that military leaders of that time period wore belts that were elaborate, wide, and fastened by \\"a narrow strap which was riveted to the broad belt and passed through a buckle which was much narrower than the belt itself\\" leaving the end of the belt to hang down; attached to the belt were pouches which allowed soldiers to carry their weapons. The Abingdon Sword, late Anglo-Saxon era Archaeological excavations in the 1990s uncovered three 7th century male graves, each with tablet-woven bands. The clothing remnants appeared to be part of a jacket garment. The artefacts were analysed and later interpreted to be the front borders of a wrap-over fighting jacket, as seen on the Sutton Hoo helmet panels and other 7th century art. Historians believe that Anglo-Saxon soldiers wore wrap-over, knee-length coats decorated like chain mail with sleeves that narrowed at the wrists. The jacket would be decorated with \\"patterned tablet woven bands stitched to the front opening and perhaps also to the hem and cuffs....Most of the comparative material suggests that the jacket was usually worn over trousers.\\" In the ninth and tenth centuries, military attire did not differ much from that of civil attire. The only changes were in the form of short linen tunics with metal collars and the addition of a sword, spear, shield, and helmet. Weapons and clothes fittings worn on the battlefield were highly decorated with jewellery techniques, as seen in the discoveries at Sutton Hoo and in the Staffordshire Hoard; the concept of parade wear did not exist for the Anglo-Saxons. Dress and religion 19th century costume historian and writer, James Planch√©, believed that the clergy of the 9th and 10th centuries dressed similarly to the laity, except when saying mass. Beginning in the later 8th century, the clergy were forbidden to wear bright colours or expensive or valuable fabrics. He also asserted that the clergy wore linen stockings. The clergy of the 11th century had shaved heads and wore hats which, according to Planch√©, were \\"slightly sinking in the centre, with the pendent ornaments of the mitre attached to the side of it\\". Other garments included the chasuble, the outermost liturgical vestment, which retained its shape, and the dalmatics, a tunic like vestment with large, bell shaped sleeves, which tended to be arched on the sides. The pastoral staff was generally found to be plain in colour and ornamentation. Clothing construction=Raw materials Horned Soay ram From the fifth to the eleventh centuries, the raw materials available to create textiles were wool from sheep, linen from flax, and imported silk. Wool was produced from a variety of sheep breeds, including primitive brown sheep (ancestors to the Soay sheep breed), white sheep brought by the Romans to Britain, and black- faced sheep that were introduced during the Viking invasions. Clothing made from the wool of sheep would be available in a selection of colour variations from white to brown and black. Silk was not cultivated in England but imported as finished garments, lengths of cloth, or sewing/embroidery threads. According to Owen-Crocker, \\"Linen production was a longer process, involved planting flax seed, weeding, harvesting, removal of seed pods, retting (rotting) the woody stems in water or a dewy field, drying, beating, and ‚Äòscrutching‚Äô the flax stems to break them and release the fibres inside, then repeated heckling or combing of those fibres to prepare them for spinning.\\" Manufacturing In the fifth and sixth centuries, women were the manufacturers of Anglo-Saxon clothing, weaving textiles on looms in their homes. About 70% of a woman's year was spent making textiles. Between the seventh and ninth centuries, Anglo-Saxon communities changed slowly from small villages to larger villages and larger estates. Specialised workshops on the big estates would be responsible for the manufacture of textiles and clothing for the residents of the estate. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the growth of urban centres around England changed the variety and quantity of materials, clothing, and accessories that people had access to and the way in which clothing and accessories were manufactured. Dye-testing of textile remnants from Anglo-Saxon graves has revealed that clothing was not dyed in the Anglo-Saxon era, except for tablet-woven-bands which edged women's garments. This could signify that artificial pigment was never present or that garment colour has been lost over time due to deterioration. It is probable that garments were not washed often. Washing would fade any artificial dyes that had been used, and laundering would diminish the natural weather-proof qualities of wool. Analysis of textile fragments from burial artefacts has indicated the absence of felting, which shows the lack of frequent washing. Anglo-Saxon jewellery Men and women's garments were fastened by brooches, buckles, clasps and pins. Jewellery could be created from a variety of metals, including iron, copper alloy (bronze), silver or gold, or a combinations metals. The precious metals were obtained by melting down older metal objects, including Roman coins. Many brooches and buckles were decorated by techniques including casting, engraving and inlaying. Jewellery fashion 7th century disc brooch Fashion changes in women's jewellery occurred frequently in the Anglo-Saxon era. In sixth century Kent, for example, single jewelled disc brooches were in style until the end of the sixth century when more elaborate plate brooches with cloisonn√© garnet and glass settings were the fashion. This fashion trend was followed by opulent composite jewelled brooches that disappeared around the middle of the seventh century. Dress pins began to appear at the beginning of the seventh century. Pendants also became fashionable at this time. Necklets came into fashion, typically created with silver-wire rings and coloured glass beads. 7th century buckle with triangular plate In male graves, belt sets with triangular plates inspired by Frankish fashion appear in the late sixth century and span the first half of the seventh century. Later in the seventh century, small buckles with rectangular plates become typical. Finger rings are worn in the early Anglo-Saxon era, but declined in popularity in the seventh and eighth centuries, and became fashionable again in the ninth century. At the end of the seventh century, circular brooches increased in popularity over long brooches, and annular and disc brooches start appearing in grave-goods. Eighth century circular brooches are rarely found, but many examples have been found from the ninth to eleventh centuries. Anglo-Saxon rings, 7th to 11th century Brooches which resemble modern safety pins appear in the seventh century. Straight pins continue to be popular in the seventh century, and are sometimes made of gold and silver. Garlands of beads, which decorated women's garments in the fifth and sixth centuries, fade from view in the seventh century. The most noticeable jewellery fashion change in the seventh and eighth century was the use of necklace pendants. These style pendants were inspired by a combination of Frankish, Byzantine and Roman art. Straight pins continue to be popular in the tenth and eleventh centuries. They are considered functional items during this time period and are being mass-produced. Finger rings continue to be popular. Anglo-Saxon gold pectoral cross Jewellery production Men and women continued to wear prominent jewellery, much of which was practical, as clasps to fasten clothing (buttons were not used). Precious metals were used by those who could afford them. In the early Anglo-Saxon era, most jewellery was perhaps created by itinerant craftsmen who would move from village to village. Some jewellery was made by monks, who also made religious metalwork. In the seventh to the ninth centuries, the Anglo-Saxon communities changed slowly from small villages to increasingly larger villages and large estates. On larger estates, specialised workshops would be responsible for the manufacture of jewellery and metalwork for the residents of the estate. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the growth of urban centres throughout England changed the variety and quantity of jewellery made available to Anglo-Saxons and the methods in which jewellery was produced.

He is known for his interpretations of the works of Mahler, Haydn, Shostakovich, Beethoven, Bruckner and Hans G√°l. He has conducted orchestras including the English Chamber Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Royal Northern Sinfonia and National Symphony Orchestra.  Conductor of the English Symphony Orchestra and English String Orchestra  In 2013, Woods was appointed as the third Principal Conductor of the English Symphony Orchestra/English String Orchestra (the orchestra performs under both names), succeeding Vernon Handley. In 2015, he became the ESO's Artistic Director. Woods joined the ESO when the orchestra was mired in a period of financial and artistic stagnation. Early in his tenure, the orchestra commissioned their first major new work in several years, a violin concerto by Deborah Pritchard inspired by oil paintings of Maggi Hambling called \\"Wall of Water.\\" That work was premiered on a concert all 21st Century music by women composers, alongside works by Kaija Saariaho, Thea Musgrave and Emily Doolittle with violinist Harriet Mackenzie in LSO St Luke's in October 2014. The critical response to that concert and the ensuing live recording on Nimbus, the orchestra's first in over a decade, quickly re- established the ESO as one of the UK's most innovative and influential orchestras. As conductor of the ESO, Woods has since premiered, commissioned or made first recordings of new works by Robert Fokkens, David Matthews, Emily Doolittle, Tom Kraines, Kile Smith, Geoffrey Gordon, Deborah Pritchard, Stephen Gerber, Nimrod Borenstein, Toby Young, Paul Patterson, Hans G√°l, Donald Fraser, James Francis Brown and Jesse Jones. Woods has long been a champion of music by composers whose lives were disrupted or music banned by the Nazis. In 2015-6, the orchestra made the first integral recording of the Complete Piano Concertos of Ernst Krenek in two volumes for Toccata Classics. Those recordings were named one of the Best Recordings of 2016 in The Times of London, and one of the 11 Best Recordings of 2017 in Forbes Magazine. Appropriately for an orchestra based in the home town of composer Edward Elgar, that composer's music features largely in Woods' work with the ESO. In 2015, the orchestra undertook a series of concerts called an \\"Elgar Pilgrimage\\" with concerts in the cities of the Midlands where Elgar lived and worked. The series culminated in the premiere on the Birmingham University campus of a new orchestration of Elgar's Piano Quintet by composer Donald Fraser. That concert was named 2015 Classical Music Magazine Premiere of the Year. In 2018, Woods' was appointed as Artistic Director of the Elgar Festival, established by the City of Worcester as the official celebration of the life and music of Edward Elgar in the city of his birth. The inaugural Elgar Festival in 2018 was Critic's Pick in both The Times and The Guardian. In 2019, Woods and the ESO gave the official 100th Anniversary performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto with Raphael Wallfisch at the Elgar Festival. Woods has also expanded the ESO's repertoire to include opera. The orchestra's first full-length opera was Jane Eyre by John Joubert, given its world premiere by the orchestra under Woods' baton in October 2016. The premiere of Joubert's opera was subsequently name Classical Music Magazine Premiere of the Year, the second year in a row the ESO received this honour, and was hailed by the Birmingham Post as the highlight of classical music in Birmingham in 2016. In 2019, the ESO made their first foray into the operas of Wagner with an acclaimed performance of Act One of Die Walk√ºre. In 2013, Woods re-established the position of Composer-in-Association, previously held by Sir Michael Tippett and Nicholas Maw. The first composer to hold this position during Woods' tenure at the ESO was John McCabe. Following McCabe's death in 2015, Woods appointed the English composer Philip Sawyers to the position which has since been renamed in memory of McCabe (\\"John McCabe Composer-in-Association Chair\\"). Sawyers work with the ESO has included a song cycle commemorating the centenary of the outbreak of World War I (Songs of Loss and Regret), a Fanfare, a Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, a Trumpet Concerto, an Elegiac Rhapsody for Trumpet and Strings in Memory of John McCabe and his Third Symphony. The ESO's recording of Sawyers' Songs of Loss and Regret, Fanfare and Third Symphony was 2017 Gramophone Magazine Critics' Choice \\"Best of the Year'. Sawyers was succeed in 2018 by David Matthews, whose tenure saw acclaimed recordings of his Ninth Symphony, Variations for Strings and Double Concerto for Violin and Viola. In 2020, Adrian Williams takes up the position. Sawyers Third Symphony also became the first work in the ESO's 21st Century Project, an effort to commissions nine new symphonies by leading composers. Subsequent works in the series have included David Matthews' Ninth Symphony and the Fifth Symphony of Matthew Taylor.  Orchestra of the Swan  In 2009, Woods was appointed Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra of the Swan, a professional chamber orchestra based in Stratford-upon-Avon.Perhaps the most important achievement of Woods' tenure at the Orchestra of the Swan was making the first complete recording of the symphonies of Austrian composer Hans G√°l for Avie Records. His recordings with the orchestra also include the complete symphonies of Robert Schumann, Gustav Mahler's first and last song cycles for orchestra, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellan and Das Lied von der Erde as orchestrated by Schoenberg, Brahms' Serenade in D Major. A key impact of Woods' time with the orchestra was an emergence of the orchestra as a presence on radio, particularly in the United States, where live recordings of Woods' cycles of Schuman and G√°l symphonies became popular on the nationally syndicated Performance Today. In 2012, his recording with the Orchestra of the Swan of new works for traditional Japanese instruments and orchestra, Springs Sounds, Spring Seas, was a MusicWeb Recording of the Year.  Colorado MahlerFest  In 2015, he took over the leadership of Colorado MahlerFest, one of only two North American musical organisations (the other being the New York Philharmonic) to receive the Gold Medal of the International Gustav.Mahler Society. As the festival's second artistic director, Woods established a new training institute for young conductors (the Mahler Conducting Fellowship), a chair for an annual visiting composer, and an expansion of the festival's chamber music and contemporary music offerings. Visiting composers during Woods' MahlerFest tenure include David Matthews, Jesse Jones and Kurt Schwertsik. In 2017, Woods led the MahlerFest Orchestra in their first performance of the Cooke Performing Version of Mahler's Tenth Symphony in a new edition using revisions and corrections from Colin and David Matthews and Peter Wadl. In 2019, Colorado MahlerFest again broke new ground with the world premiere performance of the new Critical Edition of Mahler's First Symphony by Brietkopf & H√§rtel.  Guest conductor  Orchestras he has worked with include the National Symphony Orchestra, Cincinnati Symphony, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the Budapest Festival Orchestra, English Chamber Orchestra, Royal Northern Sinfonia, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, South Bohemian Chamber Philharmonic, North Czech Philharmonic, National Orchestra of the Dominican Republic, and the State of Mexico Symphony Orchestra. Work at music festivals has included Aspen, Lucerne, Round Top, and Scotia. He has been involved in broadcasts on BBC Radio 3, National Public Radio, and CBC Radio 2.  Arranger and composer  Woods' orchestrations and arrangements of music by other composers includes a symphonic realisation of Brahms' Piano Quartet No. 2, recorded with the ESO for Nimbus and named one of The Arts Desk's Ten Best Classical Recordings of 2018. In 2012, the English Chamber Orchestra recorded his orchestration of Viktor Ullmann's Third String Quartet. Other notable arrangements and orchestrations include works by Mahler, Schubert, Humperdinck and Tchaikovsky. Woods' own music has been recorded on Avie Records.  Entartete Musik  Woods has been a particularly notable advocate for the music of composers whose music was condemned or banned by the Nazis as Entartete Musik (Degenerate Music), including composers who were imprisoned in the Theresienstadt camp and later executed in Auschwitz. Woods was the cellist in the second American performance of Vitkor Ullmann's Third String Quartet, which he studied with Henry Meyer, longtime second violinist of the LaSalle String Quartet and himself a concentration camp survivor. Inspired by Meyer's teaching and experiences, Woods has made recording and performing of music of this generation of composers a central focus of his musical life. He has made acclaimed recordings of music by Hans Kr√°sa, Ernest Krenek, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Mieczyslaw Weinberg and particularly Hans G√°l. Woods is Honorary Patron of the Hans G√°l Society  Conducting Training and Early Career  Woods pursued advanced conducting studies at the University of Cincinnati ‚Äì College-Conservatory of Music and studied at other summer institutes and workshops. He studied conducting with Leonard Slatkin, David Zinman, Jorma Panula and Gerhard Samuel. In Spring, 2000, David Zinman selected Woods to be a fellow in the inaugural class of the American Academy of Conducting at Aspen. In Spring, 2001, Woods was selected by Leonard Slatkin as one of four participants in the Kennedy Center National Conducting Institute. At the completion of the Institute, he led the National Symphony Orchestra in a debut concert, drawing a return invitation from the NSO. Woods was music director of the Grande Ronde Symphony from 1999 to 2002, and the Oregon East Symphony from 2000-9. At the OES he was the founding artistic director of a new training orchestra and training institute and oversaw an expansion of educational and outreach activities. He has led the creation and programming of educational concert series, been active in community outreach and as a collaborator with music educators. Woods has conducted productions of operas from Britten to Puccini, and ballet scores such as Giselle, The Nutcracker, The Firebird, and Konservatoriet. Woods's activities as a proponent of contemporary music include collaborations as a conductor or cellist with such figures as John Corigliano, Krzysztof Penderecki, Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen, and others.  Teaching  Woods was invited by the Rose City Chamber Orchestra to start a new international workshop for young conductors. The Rose City International Conductor's Workshop became a successful training center for emerging conductors. At Colorado MahlerFest, Woods established the Mahler Conducting Fellowship, attracting three outstanding young conductors each year to work in the festival. Woods has also taught conducting in master classes organized by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and The Bridgewater Hall, and is a consultant and has been an adjudicator at institutions such as the Royal College of Music. From 1999-2002 he was head of conducting, strings and chamber music at Eastern Oregon University. Working with young orchestras has been an important part of Woods' conducting career. He was Music Director of the Dayton Philharmonic in 1999, Music Director of the Grande Ronde Youth Orchestra 1999-2002, and founded the Oregon East Symphony Preparatory Orchestras in 2001 and served as their director until 2009. He has been a guest conductor and cello instructor at the University of Wisconsin School of Music Summer Music Clinic. In the UK, he was a regular conductor of the Kent County Youth Orchestra and in 2018, helped found a new advanced training orchestra through the English Symphony Orchestra youth programmes. During his tenure at the ESO, Woods has led the effort to establish the orchestra as a partner with the music hubs in Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  Cellist and Chamber Musician  As a cellist, Woods has been a recipient of the Aspen Fellowship, the Dale Gilbert Award, the Strelow Quartet Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Arts Rural Residency Grant. He has also recorded and toured as cello soloist and chamber musician. He has played chamber music with members of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and the Tokyo, LaSalle, Borodin, Lark and Pro Arte Quartets. He was founding cellist of the Taliesin Trio and of the Masala Quartet, who have recorded for Vienna Modern Masters. In 2006 he became a founding artist of the Clocktower Chamber Music Festival in Durango, Colorado. In 2008, he became artist in residence at the Ischia Chamber Music Festival. That year he also become the founding cellist of the string trio, Ensemble Epomeo, with whom he toured the United States and Europe in 2009. Ensemble Epomeo would go on to be ensemble-in-residence at the Newburyport Chamber Music Festival, the Scotia Festival of Music and the Two Rivers Festival. The trio's first CD comprised the world premiere recordings of the complete string trios of Hans G√°l, coupled with those of Hans Kr√°sa, a 2012 Gramophone Editor's Choice. Their next disc included string trios by Schnittke, Penderecki, Weinberg and Kurt√°g. In 2014, Ensemble Epomeo released Auricolae: The Double Album, a collection of new storytelling works for violin, cello and narrator including new works by David Yang, Jay Reise, Andrew Waggoner, Kile Smith and Woods' own setting of Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Ugly Duckling.\\" Ensemble Epomeo included the complete Beethoven String Trios in their repertoire, and premiered over 25 new works between 2009 and 2017. In 2018, Woods made his first recording as cellist of the newly-formed Briggs Piano Trio, a disc including Shostakovich's Piano Trio in E minor and two piano trios by Hans G√°l. That disc was also a Gramophone Editor's Choice and was featured in Gramophone's year-end Best CD's of 2018 issue.  Writer  Woods is also the author of a blog, A View from the Podium, often cited as one of the most popular classical music blogs in the world. He has been commissioned to write essays, features and programme notes for Gramophone, BBC Music Magazine, Classical Music Magazine, EMI Records, ICA Classics, Warner Classics, Avie Records, Somm Recordings, Toccata Classics, Listen Magazine and others.

The most typical domino games are layout games, i.e. games in which the players add matching tiles from their hand to a layout in the middle of the table. These can be either blocking games, in which the object is to empty one's hand, or scoring games, in which the players can score during the game by creating certain configurations. Other games using domino sets are often adaptations of card games. On the other hand, there are also domino-like card games, e.g., Sevens and the once very popular card game Pope Joan. Layout games=Blocking gamesBasic Trains= The games of the Trains family, of which this is the most basic representative, are typically played with at least double-nine or double-twelve sets. The number of tiles that each player draws initially depends on the number of players and the size of the set. If one player does not have a double, the tiles are shuffled again. In the first round each player plays a double to start a private line of play, known as a train. In subsequent rounds, players first add a tile to their own train or pass if they cannot do this. A player who did not pass can also add at most one tile each to each of the other players' trains. A player who empties their hand wins the game and scores 120 points plus 5 points for each tile that remains in an opposing players' hands. =Bendomino= This minor variation of the standard Draw game is due to Thierry Denoual. It is played with a double-six domino set which is standard except that every tile is bent into a 120-degree curve, so that three tiles can be assembled into a circle. This allows either end of the line of play to be blocked or both ends to connect. =Block= The Block game for two players is the simplest basic domino variant. It requires a double-six set, from which each player must draw seven tiles; the remainder is not used. The first player places a tile on the table which starts the line of play. The players alternately extend it with one matching tile at one of its two ends. A player who cannot do this passes. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. The winner's score is the total remaining pip count of the loser's hand. The winner of a blocked game is the player who has a lower pip count, and the score of the game is the difference of the pip counts.. Republished 1994 by Wordsworth Editions. There are also variants for four players. =Chicken Foot= Chicken Foot is a modern game related to the Cyprus family. =Cyprus= Cyprus is a variant of Sebastopol, but played by 4‚Äì10 players with a double-nine set. It is best described as a variant of the Draw game. Most, in some variants all, tiles are drawn by the players. The layout starts with a double, and the next eight tiles played must be attached to it, so that the layout is a star with eight open ends. The game proceeds like the Draw game, except that a player who cannot play need not draw more than once. =Draw= The Draw game is the game most often referred to as just Dominoes. It can be regarded as a variant of the Block game. Initially each player draws seven tiles from a double-six set.The first player places a tile on the table which starts the line of play. The players alternately extend it with one matching tile at one of its two ends. The main difference to the Block game is that players who cannot play must draw tiles until they find one which can be played or the stock consists of exactly two tiles. The pip count of the remaining stock (at least two tiles) is added to the losing player's remaining pip count to form the score of the game. =Maltese cross= Maltese cross is a variant of Sebastopol for 2‚Äì4 players. Like Sebastopol, it uses a double-six set. Each player draws 5 tiles (7 tiles in the case of two players). As in Cyprus, a player who cannot play must draw one tile and may play it if possible. Once the central spinner and the four adjacent tiles have been played, the next four tiles to be played must be doubles, which are turned crosswise to form the likeness of a Maltese cross, but do not act as spinners. =Matador=Mexican Train= This member of the Trains family of games, similar to Basic Trains but with an additional Mexican Train, is played mainly in the United States. It is typically played by at least four players using at least a double-twelve set. The game starts with a double in the middle of the table, acting as a spinner from which the players' \\"private trains\\" branch off. An additional \\"Mexican train\\", initially of length zero, also starts from the central spinner. Unless the tile played is a double, only one tile can be played per turn. Tiles must normally be played to the player's own train or the Mexican train. A player who cannot play must draw a tile and play that; if the stock is empty or the tile drawn cannot be played, the player must pass and mark their own train as public, allowing other players to use it like their own train and the Mexican train. The train becomes private again as soon as the owner adds a tile to it. Some variations of the game have special rules for the first round, and additional rules to ensure that doubles at the end of trains are \\"satisfied\\" as quickly as possible. Mexican Train can be regarded as a synthesis of the Trains and Cyprus families of games, with the addition of the Mexican train. =Rivers, Roads & Rails= This transportation-themed variation of the Draw game uses 140 square tiles. A small number of tiles allow the line of play to branch. Due to 90-degree curves the line of play can also get blocked in one or more directions. =Sebastopol= Sebastopol is best described as a four-player variant of the Block game. The game starts with a double in the middle, from which the line of play takes off in four directions. The next four tiles played must be attached to this central spinner. =Spinner= This game, developed by James F. and Edna Graham, is played with a standard double-nine set plus eleven additional tiles representing combinations of the standard values 0‚Äì9 with an additional \\"spinner\\" symbol and the double \\"spinner\\". A \\"spinner\\" matches any other value (similar to a wild card). Each player draws 14 (two players) or 7 (three to eight players) tiles. Play starts with the double 9, or with the double \\"spinner\\" to replace it. The second and third tile played must match with a 9 or a \\"spinner\\". Whenever a double is played later in the game, it serves as a spinner in the ordinary sense, and the line of play cannot be continued elsewhere before there are tiles on all four sides of the double. A player who cannot play must draw a tile from the stock and may play it immediately if it matches. The second game starts with the double 8, the third game with a double 7, and so on down to the double 0. Scoring gamesBergen= This is a variant of the Draw game in which scoring happens mostly during the game. There are no spinners, so that the line of play does not branch. Players score 2 points by playing a tile that makes the same value appear at both ends of the line of play, and 3 points if moreover there is a double at one end. Another 2 are scored by the player who empties their hand and ends the game, or by the player who is determined (by variable and sometimes complicated rules) to be the winner of a blocked game. A variant in which the line of play must start with a double, which acts as a spinner, is known as Double Bergen. =Muggins= Muggins, also known as All Fives or Five Up, is a variant of the Draw game in which, in addition to the scoring at the end of the game, players can score in each move if the total pip count of the endpoints of the line of play is divisible by 5. In some variants of this game the first double, or all doubles, can be used as spinners, in which the line of play branches. In the variant All Threes, players score if the total pipcount of the endpoints is divisible by 3, in Fives and Threes they score if it is divisible by 3 or 5. Other games using domino sets=5s and 3s A skillful version of dominoes played in pairs or fours used in competitions and in leagues. The aim is to be the first player to exactly reach a set number of points in a round often 61. Each player has a hand of dominoes and play proceeds as normal dominoes matching an open end. The total number of pips at the open ends (with doubles counting twice) are used to decide if a player scores points. One point is scored for each time this total is exactly divisible by either 5 or 3. So if the play started double 6 it would score 4 points as 12/3 is exactly 4. If the next player played a 6-3 then the maximum is scored for a single turn of 15 for 8 points (5 for the 3s and 3 for the 5s). If the next player were to play 6-1 the total would be 4 and they would score no points. 42 42, also known as Texas 42, is a trick-taking game played with a standard set of double-six dominoes. The rules are similar to the card game of Spades. Originally invented in Texas, it is often referred to as the \\"national game of Texas\\". Bingo This trick-taking game for two players is similar to Sechsundsechzig and Bezique. Each player draws 7 tiles from a double-six set. Then a tile is turned up from the stock, and the higher of its two values determines the trump suit. For this rule and in general, the value of a blank is considered to be 7, not 0. The winner of a trick is determined as follows. 0‚Äì0 (the bingo) beats everything else, the double of trumps beats all other trumps, and trumps beat all non-trumps except 0‚Äì0. If both tiles are non-trumps one simply compares their total pip counts. In the first phase of the game each trick is followed by both players drawing a tile from the stock. As soon as the stock is exhausted or one player \\"closes the game\\" by announcing that they will score at least 70 points, the players stop drawing. From this point on the second player in each trick is obliged to follow suit as follows: Whenever possible, a trump must be answered by a trump, and a non-trump by a tile that matches its higher end if possible, or otherwise its lower end. Scoring in this game is relatively complicated. Concentration This adaptation of the Concentration card game is generally played by two players. The tiles are placed face down on the table, shuffled and then arranged in a simple rectangular grid. The goal is to collect the largest number of pairs of tiles. With double-six dominoes, pairs consist of any two tiles whose pips sum to 12. For example, the 3‚Äì5 and the 0‚Äì4 form a pair. In some variations, doubles can only form pairs with other doubles so that the 2‚Äì2, for example, can only be paired with the 4‚Äì4 but this presents a problem with the 3-3 being unpairable. Players, in turn, try to collect pairs by turning over and exposing the faces of two tiles from the grid. If the four values of the two sum to 12, the player takes the two tiles, scores a point (in some rules a point for each tile taken), and plays again. If the tally is any other number, the bones are turned face down again and the player's turn is over. The first player to accumulate 50 (or 100) points wins the series. Double Fives This trick-taking game can be played by two or three players with a double-five set (obtained from a double-six set by removing the seven tiles showing a 6) or by four players with a full double- six set. After shuffling, each player draws 8 tiles (four-player variant: 6 tiles). The first player can play any tile from their hand. Each of the other players adds another tile to the trick; if possible it must have one value in common with the lead tile. Among those tiles for which the higher value is the same as the higher value of the lead tile, the one with the highest pip count takes the trick. Each four in a trick scores one point for the player who takes it.

King. It was nominated for the Agatha best novel award and was deemed a Notable Young Adult book by the American Library Association. In this novel, King presents the first meeting between fifteen-year-old Mary Russell, the young Jewish-American protagonist, and Sherlock Holmes. Their meeting leads to a collaboration between the two, though this first novel focuses primarily on the detective training that Holmes gives to Russell. The series that this novel begins currently stands at eighteen novels, with the latest having been published in February 2018. Plot After losing her family in a tragic motor accident in California, fifteen-year-old Mary Russell goes to live with her aunt in Sussex, England. Wandering the Sussex Downs in April 1915, she literally runs across fifty- four-year-old Sherlock Holmes, who has retired from his London practice and keeps bees. The two quickly become fast friends, Russell finding in Holmes a kindred spirit and steadfast teacher and Holmes finding in Russell a quick mind and a worthy apprentice in the art of detecting. By the time Russell enters Oxford University in the autumn of 1917, she is well-versed in Holmes's methods of disguise, tracking, and deduction. At Oxford, Russell reads chemistry and theology, immersing herself in the Bodleian Library and participating on the side in the dramatic society and elaborate pranks. Between terms, Russell solves her first cases as Holmes's apprentice, catching a German spy disguised as a neighbor's butler and apprehending a thief who had burgled the local pub. In August 1918, Holmes is consulted on the kidnapping of Jessica Simpson, the American senator's daughter, and brings Russell, elevating her apprenticeship. The pair journey in disguise as gypsies and trace the missing girl into Wales, where Russell takes initiative in rescuing Jessica, who develops a bond with her. However, Jessica's kidnappers are merely hired hands, and they fail to find the mastermind behind the plot. Russell and Holmes emerge from the case with a stronger sense of partnership, having solidified their mutual trust of each other's instincts. One afternoon in December, Russell returns to her lodgings to find Holmes, injured from a bomb and having defused another one set at Russell's door. A third fails to kill Dr. Watson. Their mysterious opponent stalks Russell and Holmes by savaging their cab and leaving a puzzling series of slashes on the cab seat. They deduce she is a formidable woman who knows Holmes's methods thoroughly and has infiltrated some of his secure boltholes in London. Faced with a powerful opponent, Holmes elects to frustrate her by leaving England entirely with Russell. The pair set off for Palestine for six weeks on a mission with two of Mycroft's spies (this interlude becomes the focus of King's later novel O Jerusalem). Upon their return, Russell and Holmes embark on a charade of estrangement from each other, hoping that Holmes's vulnerability will draw their enemy in for the kill. However, playing the part takes a toll on both. They are also under heavy surveillance by the enemy and unable to converse frankly. In May, Russell discovers that the slashes on the cab seat spell MORIARTY in Roman numerals according to Base 8, and connects the case with her missing maths tutor, Patricia Donleavy, who had given her exercises in Base 8. At her lodgings, she finds Holmes, who informs her that their attacker is preparing to strike. The two make for Sussex to set a trap, only to find Donleavy already lying in wait for them. Donleavy reveals herself as the orchestrator of Jessica Simpson's kidnapping and the revenge-seeking daughter of Professor Moriarty, whom Holmes hurled to his death at the Reichenbach Falls. Holmes provokes her to attack him, and Russell intervenes, leading to a struggle in which Donleavy is killed and Russell is heavily injured by the same bullet. During her long recovery, Russell sinks into depression due to the heavy emotional toll of the estrangement from Holmes as well as Donleavy's betrayal, as a figure of authority she had trusted. A letter from Jessica Simpson provides some catharsis, causing Russell to revive her partnership with Holmes. Reception Feminist scholar Lillian Doherty calls The Beekeeper's Apprentice \\"vivid and highly entertaining\\", saying her strong identification with the character of Mary Russell produced a temporary enhancement of her own sense of competence. BBC Radio adaptation In 2000 The Beekeeper's Apprentice was adapted as a 4-part BBC radio dramatization starring Monica Dolan as Russell, James Fox as Holmes and Sian Thomas as Donleavy. Shaun Prendergast, who wrote the adaptation also starred as Watson.

It was founded in 2000 by Tom DeVesto in collaboration with Henry Kloss, who noticed a gap in the consumer audio market for a high-quality, well designed and affordable AM/FM radio. Tivoli Audio is best known for its Model One Radio. History The Company was founded in Massachusetts in 2000 by legendary audio engineer Henry Kloss and entrepreneur Tom DeVesto, who noticed a gap in the consumer audio market for high-quality, well designed and affordable audio products. Their first product was the Model One, a simple to use mid-century modern designed table top radio with a high-performance tuner, receiving FM radio in congested urban locations, while maintaining the ability to pick out distant or low power stations. Kloss had noted that the mid 60's wave of Japanese radios lacked the ability to receive FM stations in congested locations, and this became a defining goal of his radio designs throughout his career. Kloss passed away in 2002, but Tivoli Audio continued. By 2006, Tivoli Audio had become a global luxury brand, selling in over 30 countries and gaining recognition in the audio and design world. As of 2015, the company is operated under new management consisting of Tivoli Audio veterans Paul DePasquale, Chief Executive Officer & Designer, and Dan Atanasov, Chief Financial Officer. They have developed new products, ideas and opportunities to further diverse and steer Tivoli Audio as a lifestyle brand. DePasquale developed the initiative to connect the brand with the hospitality industry, focusing on products and practices, which have led to global partnerships with Ritz Carlton, Marriott Hotels and Ace Hotels using Tivoli Audio products to enhance their guest‚Äôs stay. In 2016, Tivoli Audio launched the ART wireless collection, injecting the latest in audio technology and music features, such as wi-fi streaming and Spotify Connect, while staying true to luxury designs and quality craftsmanship. The company also has continued to explore unique partnerships to expand the brand‚Äôs lifestyle approach with new collaborations, such as the 2018 limited-edition model with global fashion brand Supreme. As of 2019, Tivoli Audio opened a flagship showroom and shop on Boston's Newbury Street. Products After the Model One, Tivoli Audio continued to produce and release products that were true to their mission statement, making simple- to-use high-quality audio products at a fair price. The next decade saw many new releases such as the PAL (Portable Audio Laboratory), Model Three (Alarm Clock Radio) and the All-in-one Music System, to name a few. The DAB+ product range portable PAL+ and PAL+BT received awards and excellent reviews over the years for best portable radio as well as best tested from Lyd & Bilde. This range of products, recognizable with the + in the product name experienced great success in Scandinavian DAB+ countries like Denmark and Norway since their introductions following the PAL+ in 2011.In 2016 Tivoli Audio further diversified their product line by releasing the ART Collection, merging high quality audio, wireless streaming and smart home technology in a range of mid- century modern designs. Tivoli has released many collaborations and special collections, fully recognizing the consumer demand for custom made products. Different styles and finishes were released and collaborations forged between Tivoli and brands like Coach, Cappallini, Anthropology, NPR, and Supreme.

Finley inserted him to replace Merle Harmon. Moore traveled west when the team moved to Oakland in , remaining the team's principal radio voice through the season, and its television voice until .Broadcasters: Moore says Finley never directed his opinions He would return to head up the team's television broadcasts from 1988 through 1992. Broadcast partners During Moore‚Äôs tenure, he had a number of co- announcers with him in the booth, including Harry Caray, Bob Elson, Al Helfer, Red Rush and Jim Woods, all of whom had achieved fame as major-league broadcasters elsewhere before joining the A‚Äôs, and Jon Miller, who went on to success with the Orioles and Giants. Former major league players Curt Flood, Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, and Jim Piersall served as A‚Äôs announcers at one time, as did former player and manager Bill Rigney. Perhaps his longest and most remembered pairing was with Ray Fosse, who joined the A's television broadcasts on a part-time basis in 1986. Fosse was the A's full-time color analyst by 1988 and his pairing with Moore remained until Moore's retirement. Moore has said that his \\"worst year was 1970 with Harry Caray.\\" Catchphrase Moore is fondly remembered by A's fans for his \\"There She Goes...\\", \\"Dinger\\" home run calls, \\"The Swinging A's\\" and \\"The Good Guys In The White Shoes !!\\"Cahill good as gold uniform in 6th straight win which he uttered many a time while calling games during the early years of A's notables such as Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Bert \\"Campy\\" Campaneris, Mark McGwire and Jos√© Canseco.

He also announced on NBC's Saturday Game of the Week broadcasts from 1978‚Äì80 and on the USA Network's Thursday Game of the Week broadcasts from 1979-83. He returned to the A's in to handle local TV play-by-play on a part-time basis with Ted Robinson until , and full-time thereafter before retiring at the end of the season. Dick Stockton replaced him to start the season.STOCKTON HAS HAPPY REUNION Later career Following his retirement from baseball broadcasting, Moore put his radio experience to work in heading up a radio station, KTIP 1450 AM, in Porterville, California, where he resides. Among those who came under his tutelage were the current radio voice of the USC Trojans, Pete Arbogast, and Wayne Garcia, currently the lead news anchor for KPTV in Portland, Oregon. Pete roomed with, and trained, Garcia when the latter was still in high school.

The sanctuary is known for the Marian apparition of Our Lady and Holy Family. Dzhublyk is situated in the Irshava raion of Zakarpattya region, also known as Transcarpathia. In the years following the revelation of August 2002, an ever increasing number of pilgrims arrive to Dzhublyk. Background The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was heavily persecuted by the Soviet authorities from 1946 to 1989. In 1988 Ukraine celebrated a \\"Millennium of Christianity\\" marking one thousand years since the \\"baptism of Kievan Rus\\" in 988. In June 2001, Pope John Paul II visited Ukraine and at a Byzantine-rite liturgy in L'viv, canonized twenty-seven Greek Catholic martyrs of the twentieth century. From 1989 to 2006, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church went through a period of re-building and re-organization, starting with the legalization of the UGCC.Horiacha, Mariya and Hurkina, Svitlana. Churches In-between: Greek Catholic Churches in Postsocialist Europe, Chap 3.5, \\"Ukraine\\", LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2008 Nyzhnye Bolotnye is an exceptional place in Transcarpathia, as the local Greek Catholic Church building was never fully closed or turned into a sports hall, but remained a place of prayer throughout communism. Nyzhnye Bolotnye became one of the main areas of operation of the most prominent underground priests of Transcarpathia, Petro Oros, Petro Pavlo Madjar and Ivan Margitych. Apparition It is said that on August 27, 2002 near the water- spring at Dzhublyk the Mother of God appeared to two girls, ten-year-old Olena Kuruts from Vilkhivka and her friend, nine-year-old Mariana Kobol.Naumescu, Vlad. Modes of Religiosity in Eastern Christianity: Religious Processes and Social Change in Ukraine, Chap. 7, \\"The Religious Imaginaries of Western Ukraine, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2007 The girls were fetching water from a spring when they saw a beautiful young woman, dressed in white clothes with a blue belt, standing on a low-hanging cloud. She smiled but did not speak. The frightened children returned home and told their parents. Mariana's father, Petro, is a Greek Catholic priest. Father Petro instructed the girls to ask the woman her name should they see her again. Later that day they saw the woman again on their way home from picking up Olena'a sister from kindergarten; this time accompanied by two angels. The woman identified herself as the Virgin Mary and said that she had come to help. Father Petro joined the girls on the third day. According to social anthropologist Agnieszka Halemba, Father Petro is active in promoting \\"a type of religiosity based on a combination of strict discipline and high emotional involvement.\\"Halemba, Agnieszka. \\"National, transnational or cosmopolitan heroine? The Virgin Mary's apparitions in contemporary Europe\\" in Cosmopolitan Sociability: Locating Transnational Religious and Diasporic Networks, ed. Tsypylma Darieva, Nina Glick Schiller, Sandra Gruner-Domic, p.59, Routledge, 2014 During the following apparition, on Saturday, August 31, the Mother of God asked the girls to inform the church authorities that it was in fact her, the Mother of God, who came and asks here, on the place of revelation to pray. To the question of Father Petro, \\"Which bishops to inform about this\\", Mary answered - \\"The elderly vladyka Margitych\\", who was auxiliary bishop of Mukachevo at that time. Later the children reported that the visions included Jesus and St. Joseph. The apparition of the Mother of God became that of the Holy Family. Mariana stopped seeing visions. After one particularly stressful vision, Olenka was left temporarily speechless, and conveyed to her parents, using pen and paper, that she would not be able to attend school during Lent which had just begun.Vlad, Mariya. \\"Appearances of the Virgin in a remote village\\", Welcome to Ukraine Magazine The local bishop supported and promoted the visions. Bishop Margitych died one year later September 7, 2003, 83 years old during the archi-hierarchic church service, for which he came to bless the new throne. Veneration One of the visions requested the construction of a monastery of the Holy Family in Dzhublyk. Construction was begun in the summer of 2003 but halted soon after due to a conflict between locals and the clergy. The monastery \\"Appearance of the Holy Family\\" was later completed, built as convent. At present there is a Chapel of Saint John the Baptist, with a large roofed assembly square in front of it. A copy of the Icon of God's Mother of Jerusalem is kept in the chapel. Stations of the Cross lead to the top of the hill behind the chapel. According to Father Atanazji Cijpes, manager of the site, all the buildings are planned and designed by the Virgin. The site has developed into an important pilgrimage destination. On the 27th of each month busloads of pilgrims arrive, mainly from Ukrainian Galicia and neighboring Slovakia. Each year on August 27, an anniversary of the apparitions is celebrated with fireworks.Halemba, Agnieszka. \\"Virgin Mary and the Border: Identity Politics of the Greek Catholic Church at the Ukrainian/Slovak Borderland\\", Sociol√≥gia 40, 2008, ƒç. 6 p. 548 Analysis According to Vlad Naumescu, the apparitions at Dzhublyk represent a call for unity. Mary is reported to have said, \\"I want to raise the authority of priests in the people, unite this divided nation and unite the Church.\\" Halemba sees the site as an example of Ukrainian national identity building, even to the point of the Virgin expressing a preference for the liturgy in Ukrainian rather than Old Slavic. She further sees this as reflective of a tension between one group, led by Archbishop Semedii, who saw Transcarpathia as a multi-ethnic area in need of a separate administration; and a Ukrainian-unity group led by Bishop Margitych, who saw no need for that. The Vatican supported a sui iuris status, and the Mukachevo eparchy is directly answerable to Rome. The Virgin Mary, however, would appear to support the view of the late bishop Margitych. Chronicle of Dzhublyk apparitions * The Virgin Mary also asked for a hospital to be built. * Visible signs on the sun - for those who do not believe in this. The sun performs a \\"dance\\", rotates around its axis, changing its colours. Besides that, on the place of revelation, often appears a rainbow - visible sign of union between God and people. * \\"Message, that is passed by girls from Nyzhnye Bolotnye - \\"is in spirit of God's Mother\\", - so it is regarded at Apostolic Nunciature in Ukraine (according to the words of Bishop Marhitych).

One year later, Katherine returned from walk with Lilian and she found out that Wayne had visited Dylan while Mary Alice babysat her and gave her a new doll. Katherine put the doll on top of a heavy oak dresser and got into a fight with Wayne, hitting him with a candlestick. After Wayne left, Katherine discovers Dylan had tried to retrieve her doll and died when the dresser fell on top of her. Fearing Wayne‚Äôs wrath, Katherine and Lillian buried Dylan in nearby woods and she left Wisteria Lane, lying Susan and Mary Alice that she had taken a job offer in Chicago. Katherine adopted a girl very similar to Dylan from a Romanian orphanage. Katherine began raising her new daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), and they moved to Chicago. Later Katherine married gynecologist Adam Mayfair (Nathan Fillion) from Harvard. Katherine lied to Adam that Wayne killed her biological daughter; he agreed to keep her secret and protect them from her ex-husband. After short affair between Adam and Sylvia Greene (Melora Walters), which took all their savings and friends from them in Chicago, the Mayfairs moved to Wisteria Lane, Fairview to care for Lillian, now terminally ill, and escape the humiliation of Adam's alleged sexual harassment. Season 4 Twelve years after leaving Wisteria Lane, Katherine, Adam and Dylan move into Lillian's house. Susan introduces Katherine to Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle, her friends and neighbours; Katherine immediately clashes with each of them, particularly Bree. Meanwhile, Dylan doesn't remember living on Wisteria Lane. Katherine begins integrating herself into Susan's circle of friends but continues to conflict with Bree, Gabrielle and Lynette. Katherine's mysterious and cold exterior and Dylan‚Äôs lack of memories about life on Wisteria Lane raise the suspicions of their neighbours. Dylan questions Katherine about her birth father but Katherine only says that he is too dangerous to let back into their lives. Lillian moves into the Mayfairs' guest bedroom and writes a detailed account of the original Dylan‚Äôs death in a note addressed to Dylan Mayfair, but dies before she can give it to her. Sylvia Greene (Melora Walters), the woman who accused Adam of sexual harassment in Chicago, visits him - hoping to rekindle their romance. Katherine thinks Sylvia's accusations are false but Adam admits having had an affair with her, which is why he settled out of court and they \\"lost everything\\" in Chicago. Katherine kicks Adam out of the house. While packing, he finds Lillian's note and leaves after confronting Katherine about her lies and she throws the note in the fire. However, Dylan salvages a few pieces and deducts that Katherine killed Wayne. She calls Adam for more answers but he calls Katherine. He promises to give her one last alibi and lie to Dylan but their marriage is still over. Katherine and Bree finally put aside their rivalry to start a catering business. Meanwhile, Wayne tracks down Dylan and the two start meeting in private; eventually, she reintroduces the two. Hoping to drive Wayne away, Katherine tells him that Dylan is not his daughter and a DNA test confirms that. Adam learns that Wayne has located Katherine and Dylan and offers to help them escape, deciding to take Dylan on a graduation trip and never return but Wayne kidnaps Adam. Fearing Wayne has killed Adam, Katherine begs Dylan to leave immediately but Dylan demands the entire truth. Katherine tells her, prompting Dylan to walk out. Later, Wayne corners Katherine and takes her hostage. Before he can shoot her, Adam arrives. Knowing Wayne will always track her, Katherine shoots him. Bree, Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle tell the police that her actions were in self-defence and Katherine is finally integrated into their social group. Dylan returns and reunites with her mother. =Five-year jump= Bree and Katherine open up their catering company and Katherine is the head chef. Katherine is jealous that Bree is taking credit for some stuff that is not hers. Season 5 During the five years between seasons four and five, Katherine remains on Wisteria Lane. Katherine briefly moves in with Bree, a recovering alcoholic who relapses when her husband, Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), leaves for jail.\\"Mirror, Mirror\\". David Grossman (director), Jeff Greenstein (writer). Desperate Housewives. ABC. October 26, 2008. Season 5, no. 5. Katherine's rivalry with Bree continues despite their shared business. Katherine is unhappy when she realises that Bree has used her recipes in her cookbook and leaves her to run the business while she publicises it. Her resentment deepens when Bree hires Orson as an employee. Yearning for romance, Katherine secretly begins dating Mike Delfino (James Denton), Susan's ex-husband. Eventually, Susan finds out about the relationship and feels betrayed. She eventually gives them her blessing but is uncomfortable with their relationship. Katherine begins spending more time with Susan and Mike's son, M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) and move in together. Susan tells Mike and Katherine that she's marrying Jackson but is horrified to learn that Mike will no longer have to pay her alimony. Katherine deceives Susan by letting her think Mike will pay alimony regardless. When Susan wants to thank Mike herself, Katherine admits not telling him that Susan's engagement to Jackson isn't real, afraid that he would leave her for Susan. The couple elope to Las Vegas, but Mike leaves Katherine at the airport when he learns that their neighbour, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), plans to kill M.J. in revenge. M.J. escapes unharmed and Mike and Susan share a passionate kiss following the ordeal. Season 6 In the sixth season premiere, it is revealed that Mike married Susan, not Katherine. When Susan is out, her wedding dress is delivered to Katherine's house. Katherine wears it while cooking to annoy Susan. She also demands that Susan publicly apologize to her for taking Mike away. Susan initially refuses and locks her in a closet, Katherine then breaks free and crashes the wedding. Susan then apologizes, but Katherine's feelings remain bitter. When Susan is away, Katherine visits Mike, gives him a kiss and tells him she'll be there for him. Katherine then tells Orson that Mike made a pass at her, hoping this will get back to Susan. Bree becomes concerned when she sees Katherine spying through Susan and Mike's windows one night. After an incident at a wedding they were catering, Bree fires Katherine and advises her to seek professional help. Furious, Katherine scratches Bree's car. Katherine's rivalry with Susan intensifies as she continues pursuing Mike. Things come to a head at a neighborhood watch meeting after Susan ignores Katherine when she tries to volunteer, escalating into Susan publicly threatening Katherine if she doesn't leave her and Mike alone. Realizing the danger Katherine poses, Susan begins suspecting Katherine attacked her daughter, Julie Mayer, out of revenge. Though Katherine has an alibi, Susan and Mike's fears about Katherine are soon realized. When Mike hears Katherine told M.J. that Susan is a bad mother, he coldly tells her that he never loved her. When he leaves, Katherine stabs herself in the stomach with a knife that has Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike and he is sent to jail while she is in hospital. Susan worries that Katherine has suffered a nervous breakdown and asks Dylan to visit and have her mother committed for psychiatric observation. She then learns that Katherine has been telling Dylan that she, not Susan, was married to Mike. When Katherine realizes she's been caught, she has a complete breakdown. Katherine is institutionalized for a couple of months. When Katherine returns to Wisteria Lane, she develops a friendship with Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz), a former stripper who moves in with Susan and Mike. In order to preserve her friendship with Susan, Robin moves in with Katherine. Katherine is surprised to learn that Robin is a lesbian and begins to develop a physical attraction to her, as well as an emotional connection. Katherine is very confused by these new feelings. Soon, the two become sexually involved. When their relationship is made public, Katherine decides that she cares too much about what others think and suggests that she and Robin take a vacation in Paris while they work on defining their relationship. Robin agrees and the two leave town that night. Season 8 Katherine returns to the series in the final episode \\"Finishing the Hat\\". Katherine has made a huge wad of cash as the owner of a frozen food company in France. She returns to Wisteria Lane to offer Lynette Scavo a job as the head of her United States expansion.

The Neo- Assyrian Empire arose in the 10th century BC. Ashurnasirpal II is credited for utilizing sound strategy in his wars of conquest. While aiming to secure defensible frontiers, he would launch raids further inland against his opponents as a means of securing economic benefit,Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 7 as he did when campaigning in the Levant. The result meant that the economic prosperity of the region would fuel the Assyrian war machine.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 10 Ashurnasirpal II was succeeded by Shalmaneser III. Although he campaigned for 31 years of his 35-year reign, he failed to achieve or equal the conquests of his predecessor,Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 13 and his death led to another period of weakness in Assyrian rule. Assyria would later recover under Tiglath-Pileser III, whose reforms once again made Assyria the most powerful force in the Near East,Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 17 and transformed it into a fully fledged empire ‚Äì the first of its kind. Later, under Shalmaneser V, Sargon II and Sennacherib, further Assyrian offensives occurred, although these were designed not only for conquest, but also to destroy the enemies ability to undermine Assyrian power. As such, costly battles raged taking tolls on Assyrian manpower. Esarhaddon succeeded in taking lower Egypt and his successor, Ashurbanipal, took the southern upper half of Egypt. However, by the end of the Ashurbanipal's reign it appears that the Assyrian Empire was falling into another period of weakness,Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 54 one from which it would not escape. It appears that years of costly battles followed by constant (and almost unstoppable) rebellions meant that it was a matter of time before Assyria ran out of troops. The loss of the outer regions meant that foreign troops were gone too. By 605 BC, independent political Neo- Assyrian records vanish from history. Background The Assyrian empire has been described as the \\"first military power in history\\". Mesopotamia was the site of some of the earliest recorded battles in history. In fact, the first recorded battle was between the forces of Lagash and Umma c. 2450 BC. Like many Mesopotamian records, it contains elements of fiction. The ruler of Lagash, Eanatum, was inspired by the god Ningirsu to attack the rival kingdom of Umma; the two were involved in minor skirmishes and raids along their respective borders. Although Eanatum triumphed, he was struck in the eye by an arrow. After the battle, he had the Stele of the Vultures erected to celebrate his victory. Akkadian and Old Assyrian According to legend, Sargon, the first ruler of the Akkadian Empire, was discovered by a gardener in Mesopotamia in a basket. In time, he would found the city of Agade and raise an army of 5,400 men, and then conquer much of modern-day Iraq. His inscriptions boast of 34 victories and \\"5,400 men eating bread before Sargon\\", exemplifying both the vast manpower and the obedience of his troops (and possibly a standing army as well). Though small by the standards of later kings, Sargon's army was larger and more sophisticated than others of the time, utilizing a combination of spears and missile weapons. Bronze swords and four wheeled chariots brushed aside any resistance as he carved out his empire, which may well have included (at least briefly) parts of the Mediterranean, Anatolia and western Iran. Siege warfare was not a problem; most of the cities that were walled at the time of Sargon were made of mud and his inscriptions further boast of the destruction he brought on their walls. The earliest Old Assyrian king Tudiya was a contemporary of Ibrium of Ebla.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 6 It evolved from the Akkadian Empire of the late 3rd millennium BC. Assyria was a strong nation under the rule of Ilushuma (1945‚Äì1906 BC), who founded colonies in Asia Minor and raided Isin and other Sumero-Akkadian states in southern Mesopotamia. Middle Assyrian Under Shamshi-Adad I (1813‚Äì1791 BC) and his successor Ishme-Dagan (1790‚Äì1754 BC), Assyria was the seat of a regional empire controlling northern Mesopotamia and regions in Asia Minor and northern Syria. From 1365 to 1076 BC, Assyria became a major empire and world power, rivalling Egypt. Kings such as Ashur-uballit I (1365‚Äì1330 BC), Enlil-nirari (1329‚Äì1308 BC), Arik-den-ili (c. 1307‚Äì1296 BC), Adad-nirari I (1295‚Äì1275 BC), Shalmaneser I (1274‚Äì1245 BC), Tukulti-Ninurta I (1244‚Äì1208 BC), Ashur-resh-ishi I (1133‚Äì1116 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1115‚Äì1077 BC) forged an empire which at its peak stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caspian Sea, and from the foothills of the Caucasus to Arabia.The encyclop√¶dia britannica:a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968 The 11th and 10th centuries BC were a dark age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Caucasus, Mediterranean and Balkan regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria, at heart it remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy and secure borders, was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media.According to George Roux, Ancient Iraq, p. 282‚Äì283. Information on the Assyrian army during this time is difficult to make out. The Assyrians were able to establish their independence on two occasions, during the Old Assyrian Empire and the Middle Assyrian Empire, with the latter reaching as far as Babylon in their pursuit of conquest. However, military tactics mainly involved using troops raised from farmers who had finished planting their fields and so could campaign for the king until harvest time called for their attention again. The result was that military campaigning was limited to a few months of the year. As a result, armies could not conquer vast amounts of land without having to rest (and hence allow their enemy to recover) and even if they did they would not be able to garrison conquered lands with troops for long. Organization of the military The Assyrian army's hierarchy was typical of the Mesopotamian armies at the time. The King whose rule was sanctioned by the gods, would be the commander of the entire army of the Empire. He would appoint senior officers on certain occasions to campaign in his place if his presence on the battlefield could or had to be spared. The Neo-Assyrian Empire took advantage of many different types and styles of militaristic vessels and engines for warfare. This includes chariots, cavalry, and siege engines. Pre-reform Assyria's greatest pre-reform military commander, Ashurnasirpal II Before the reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III, the Assyrian army was also very much similar to the other Mesopotamian armies of the time. Soldiers were mostly raised farmers, who had to return to their fields to collect the harvest. Professional soldiers were limited to a few bodyguards that protected the King and or other nobles and officials but these would not have been deployed or wasted in battle unless the situation became urgent, as it later did. Assyrian armies could be very large; Shalmaneser III once boasted a force of 120,000 men in his campaigns against Syria.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 23 Such a force required men to be extracted from conquered peoples. A large army also needed more food and supplies and for this the Assyrians organized what they needed for a campaign before they set out. Preparations for a new campaign Preparations for a new campaign required first and foremost the assembly of troops at a designated base. In Assyria, the designated locations included Nineveh, Kalhu or Khorsabad. On some occasions the designated meeting points would change depending upon the campaign. Governors were instructed to accumulate supplies of grain, oil and war material. Other requirements of the Governors included calling up the needed manpower. Vassal states were in particular required to present troops as part of their tribute to the Assyrian king and in good time: failure to do so would have almost certainly been seen as an act of rebellion. The arrival of the King and his bodyguard ended the preliminary stage and the army would move on to the target of their campaign. The army would march in good order; in the vanguard came the standard of the Gods, signifying the servitude of the Assyrian Kings to their primary God Assur. Following this was the King, the humble servant of Assur surrounded by his bodyguard with the support of the main chariot divisions and cavalry, the elite of the army. In the rear was the infantry; the Assyrian troops followed by the conquered peoples. Following this would be the siege train, supply wagons and then the camp followers. Such a formation would have been very vulnerable to a rear attack. Some columns of troops could travel 30 miles a day and such speed would have been used to surprise and frighten an opponent into submission. Reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III An image of Tiglath- Pileser III's troops. In the background, a siege engine can be seen. Before long, the weaknesses of the Assyrian army soon began to show itself. Battle after battle killed off important soldiers, while the seasons ensured that soldiers returned after a short time to their fields without achieving decisive conquests. By the mid-eighth century BC, the Assyrian levy-army could not cope with the demands of an empire that often stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 18 All was to change when Tiglath-Pileser III came to the throne in 745 BC. After increasing the efficiency of the Assyrian administration, he went on to change the Assyrian army as well. The most important aspect of his reform was the introduction of a standing army. This included a larger number of foreign soldiers but mixed in with other Assyrian soldiers.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 19 These men could be supplied by vassal states as tribute or when demanded by the Assyrian King. They were given Assyrian equipment and uniform which made them indistinguishable from one another, possibly to increase their integration. While the infantry in the standing army contained a large number of foreigners (including Aramaeans and even Greeks), the Assyrian cavalry and charioteers continued to be dominated by Assyrians. There were exceptions however, and as casualties mounted additional troops would not be unwelcome; Sargon II reports that he managed to incorporate 60 Israelite chariot teams into his army. Transportation and communication Assyrian army crosses a river, probably the Euphrates. Some soldiers are swimming while others are loading chariots on to a boat. Reign of Ashurnasirapl II, 865‚Äì860 BC, from Nimrud, currently housed in the British Museum Assyrians using inflated sheep skins to transport chariots across the Euphrates (or Tigris). With the rise of the Assyrian Empire, new demands were placed on transport and communication. Prior to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, roads in Mesopotamia were little more than well-trodden pathways used by the locals. However, this was inadequate for an empire whose armies were constantly on the move, repressing one revolt after another. The Assyrians were the first to institute, control and maintain a system of roads throughout their empire. A state communication system with regular way stations for messengers to rest and/or exchange mounts were established. Later, these would form the basis for the Persians to expand this system to their own empire. Rugged mountains were cut through thus greatly decreasing travel time. Engineers built fine stone pavements leading up to the grand cities of Assur and Nineveh, so as to impress foreigners with the wealth of Assyria. By the 2nd millennium BC, wooden bridges were built across the Euphrates. By the 1st millennium BC, Nineveh and Assur had stone bridges, testament to the wealth of the kingdom of Ashur. The construction of roads and increased transport meant that goods would flow through the empire with greater ease, thus feeding the Assyrian war effort further. Of course, roads that sped up Assyrian troops would not discriminate and would speed up enemy troops as well. Use of camels The Assyrians were the first to use camels as beasts of burden for their military campaigns. Camels were of greater use than donkeys because they could carry five times the load but required less watering. Camels were not domesticated until shortly before 1000 BC, on the eve of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The first camel to be domesticated was the dromedary.

In any case, the Assyrians were the first to manufacture tires of metal, made from copper, bronze and later iron. Metal-covered wheels have the advantage of being more durable.

Detail of a gypsum wall relief from Nimrud, currently housed in the British Museum The core of the Assyrian army lay in its chariots. The chariot was a fast and extremely maneuverable vessel. The use of chariots in warfare resembled a well disciplined army that dominated the battlefield in flanking maneuvers, causing opposing forces to divide or flee the battlefield. Chariots usually consisted of two or three horses, a platform with two wheels, and two soldiers. One soldier would have control of the reins to steer while the other wielded a bow and arrow to fire at enemy troops. The use of chariots is limited to a relatively flat battleground, making it effective in certain locations. The Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians used war chariots in this fashion as firing mobile platforms or as mobile command platforms; the elevated view would give the general some ability to see how the troops fared in battle. Because the chariot was fast and easily maneuverable, an alternative use for chariots was to send messages to and from the battlefield. They were also a prestigious vessel used by Assyrian kings to display wealth and power. However, the rise of cavalry in the 1st millennium BC meant that by the 7th century BC, the chariot was demoted to combat duties only; lighter chariots consisting of two to three horses were later upgraded under the reign of Ashurbanipal to heavy four-horse chariots. Such chariots could contain up to four men. Heavier chariots also found new roles, smashing into enemy formations and dispersing the infantry in the process.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 20. The Assyrian cavalry and infantry would then be able to exploit the gap and rout the enemy, thereby taking the battlefield. Cavalry Assyrian cavalry charges the enemy, dating back to the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, 865‚Äì860 BC. In this period, cavalry was relatively new. Detail of a gypsum wall relief from Nimrud, currently housed in the British Museum The use of cavalry was the result of having different and new enemies in rough and mountainous terrains. Chariots could not operate on rough terrain which meant that a new tactic needed to be developed. The cavalry operated as the chariot corps did, as an intimidating, well armored, elite class of soldiers that could dominate the battlefield and turn the tides of war. Cavalry units were well equipped with light armor, spears or lances as well as bows and arrows. The use of the cavalry in the 9th century operated almost the same as the chariots did; two horses with one soldier controlling the reins while another soldier wielded a ranged weapon. Over the course of nearly two centuries, the Assyrians were able to master the art of the cavalry. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath-Pileser III, the Assyrian cavalry continued to be paired, but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies. Cavalry could dominate the battlefields but their one weakness when attempting to divide enemy troops would have been long spears. Long spears were capable of eliminating cavalry units from a safe distance, allowing enemy troops to hold the line. Cavalry were rarely used by the Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is mentioned during the reign of Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors who raided Assyrian lands relied on cavalry. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 21. Perhaps the greatest outside influence was that of the Iranian Medes. The raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. Large units of cavalry were required to be deployed by the Assyrians; some units consisted of hundreds or even a thousand horsemen. There is little doubt that without a continuous supply of horses, the Assyrian war machine would have collapsed. As the empire suffered horrendous casualties under Ashurbanipal's campaigns of conquest, the rebellions following his death may have contributed significantly to the downfall of the empire as fewer vassals were available to pay tribute horses and other war material needed. Horses were a very important war resource and the Assyrian king himself took a personal interest in overseeing an adequate horse supply. Three main sources of horses were: * Raids designed to steal horses from opponents, such as the Scythians or other steppe peoples. * Tribute paid by vassal states. * High-ranking state officers overseeing horse production and reporting to the King. Horses were be drawn from outlying provinces and brought in to be trained with new recruits for war. Infantry Assyrian archers taking aim, under the protection of a shield bearer. While cavalry provided the most expensive and effective arm of the Assyrian Empire, infantry were cheaper and more numerous. In the right circumstances, they were also more effective, for example in siege warfare, where the mobility provided by horsemen would be of no advantage. Assyrian infantry were composed of both native Assyrians and foreigners employed as auxiliaries, spearmen, slingers, shield bearers or archers. The latter type was the most dominant in Assyrian armies. From the time of Ashurnasirpal, archers would be accompanied by a shield bearer while slingers would aim to distract the enemy into lowering their shield to protect against the stones, thereby allowing the archers to shoot above their shield walls and slay their enemies. Even in siege warfare, arrows were used to drive back defenders from the wall while engineers advanced against the fortifications. Many different types of bows are recorded by the Assyrians, including Akkadian, Cimmerian and their own \\"Assyrian\\" type. However, it is most likely that these were simply different variants of the powerful composite bow. Depending upon the bow, an archer would have a range of anything between 250 to 650 meters. Vast numbers of arrows could be expended in battle so in preparation for war many arrows would be made. Facilities also existed that would travel with the army's supply train that could manufacture more arrows.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 22 Lancers were introduced to the infantry under Tiglath-pileser III. Depictions of infantry with special bronze scale metal protection are rare and reconstructions show the smallest vests to weigh as much as 20 pounds (9 kg), with armoured suits up to the ankles tripling that weight of metal and leather.R. Hachmann, Fr√ºhe Ph√∂niker im Libanon. [German] p. 94-100 Strategy and tactics=Tactics From The Historians' History of the World : \\"The spear of the Assyrian footman was short, scarcely exceeding the height of a man; that of the horseman appears to have been considerably longer‚Ä¶ The shaft was probably of some strong wood, and did not consist of a reed, like that of the modern Arab lance.\\" Assyrian frontal assaults were designed to shock the enemy and surprise them. However, they were also a strategy employed when time was not on their side: Despite the above, Sargon II's instinct saved the day; leading his exhausted troops, he launched a surprise attack against his Urartian opponents who broke at the speed and surprise of the attack. So vicious was the battle that the Urartian King abandoned his state officials, governors, 230 members of the royal family, many cavalry and infantry, and even the capital itself. Overall war strategy Assyrian warships. The Assyrians would have used these to transport horses, chariots and supplies across rivers. Although they reached the Mediterranean on numerous occasions, rebellions in the Fertile Crescent would have made such sea ventures into the Mediterranean unlikely. The nature of Mesopotamia, plain and fertile with few natural defenses, meant that defensive operations were out of the question; only a decisive attack could defend such vulnerable yet valuable locations. The cities of Assur and Nineveh were both sandwiched between rivers; Nineveh was more enclosed and protected by the Tigris, while Assur, while being close to the Tigris, was a fair distance away from the Euphrates. The result was that both cities had a measure of natural protection. However, rivers would not stop a determined army, so attacking and destroying their enemies' ability to wage war was the best method of ensuring the survival of the Assyrians. To this end, the Assyrians sought a decisive encounter that would destroy their enemies' armies. Colonization: The Assyrians, in conjunction with their deportation policies (see below), would also send some of their own into foreign lands and settle them as colonists. The primary aim was to establish a loyal power base; taxes, food and troops could be raised here as reliably as at their homeland, or at least that must have been the hope. Furthermore, their presence would bring innumerable benefits: resistance to other conquerors, a counter to any rebellions by the natives and assisting the provincial Assyrian governors in ensuring that the vassal state was loyal to Assyria. Destruction of cities: One must be careful before assuming that the Assyrians utilized total war. However, it is known that the Assyrians, as part of their overall strategy of weakening their opponents and of exacting revenge, would violently destroy what they could not take back or could not consolidate. Regarding the Assyrian conquest of Elam, Ashurbanipal recorded: Psychological warfare The Assyrians fully appreciated the use of terrorizing their enemies. To conserve manpower and rapidly move on to solve Assyria's multiple problems, the Assyrians preferred to accept the surrender of their opponents or else destroy their ability to resist a surrender. This in part explains their offensive strategy and tactics. Deportations Detail of a gypsum wall relief depicting the deportation of the inhabitants of the city of Lachish by the Assyrian army. Reign of Sennacherib, 700-692 BC, from Nineveh, Iraq, currently housed in the British Museum The Jews were one of the many peoples deported by the Assyrians. It is not known if the Assyrians were the first to deport people, although since none before had ruled the Fertile Crescent as they did it is likely that they were the first to practice it on a large scale. The Assyrians began to utilize mass- deportation as a punishment for rebellions since the 13th century BC. The purposes of deportation included, but were not limited to: 1) Psychological warfare: the possibility of deportation would have terrorized the people; 2) Integration: a multi-ethnic population base in each region would have curbed nationalist sentiment, making the running of the Empire smoother; 3) Preservation of human resources: rather than being butchered, the people could serve as slave labor or as conscripts in the army. By the 9th century BC, the Assyrians made it a habit of regularly deporting thousands of restless subjects to other lands. Re-settling these people in the Assyrian homeland would have undermined the powerbase of the Assyrian Empire if they rebelled again. As a result, Assyrian deportation involved removing one enemy population and settling them into another. Below is a list of deportations carried out by Assyrian Kings: * 744 BC: Tiglath Pileser III deports 65,000 people from Iran to the Assyrian-Babylonian border at the Diyala river * 742 BC: Tiglath Pileser III deports 30,000 people from Hamath, Syria and into the Zagros mountains in the east. * 721 BC: Sargon II (claimed) deports 27,290 people from Samaria, Israel and disperses them throughout the Empire. However, it is likely that his ousted predecessor, Shalmaneser V ordered the deportation * 707 BC: Sargon II deports 108,000 Chaldeans and Babylonians from the Babylonian region * 703 BC: Sennacherib deports 208,000 people from Babylon Tiglath Pileser III re-introduced deportation on a grand scale, deporting tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. Deportations were also coupled with colonization; see above for more details. Dealing with rebels Assyrians flaying their prisoners alive Whenever a rebellion broke out in the Assyrian empire, the Assyrian kings inevitably brutally crushed it (as an alternative to deportation) and enforced great punishments on the rebellious vassals. Ashurnasirpal II assured that the rebellions whom he encountered would be crushed with the same cruelty so that his opponents would never do it again. In one of his expeditions, Ashurnasirpal II described how he faced the rebels, in which they were being flayed, impaled, decapitated, or burned alive: The brutal treatment of Ashurnasirpal II succeeded in pacifying the rebels. While campaigning in Syria, he was able to take a large number of soldiers from Mesopotamia, without fear of a rebellion cutting off their supply lines. They were so successful in their brutality in the northern cities of Syria in that many of the smaller settlements were immediately handed over to their troops, then they marched south in parallel of the Mediterranean. The Assyrians considered their kings as ruling with the gods‚Äô (or the god Ashur) sanction. To rebel against this most humble servant of Ashur, it means defying Ashur himself, something that could only bring divine destruction; therefore, the glorification of such brutality. Other acts of brutality are: rape, mutilation of men to death, putting heads, arms, hands and lips even down the walls of the conquered city, skulls and noses on the top at stakes. Alternatively corpses can also be stacked or even being cut and fed to the dogs. On some occasions, blinding people in that as they roam around talking about the Assyrian terrors to demoralize the local population. Siege warfare Hamanu, sacked by the Assyrians. Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against Elam in 647 BC is triumphantly recorded in this relief. Here, flames rise from the city as Assyrian soldiers topple it with pickaxes and crowbars and carry off the spoils. In 647 BC, the Assyrian king Assurbanipal leveled the city during a war in which the people of Susa apparently participated on the other side. A tablet unearthed in 1854 by Austen Henry Layard in Nineveh reveals Ashurbanipal as an \\"avenger\\", seeking retribution for the humiliations the Elamites had inflicted on the Mesopotamians over the centuries. Ashurbanipal dictates Assyrian retribution after his successful siege of Susa: The plains and fertile lands of Mesopotamia were not only ideal for warfare but actually attracted war. Raiders from all nations coveted the lands of the Assyrians: Scythians to the north, Syrians, Arameans and Cimmerians to the West, Elamites to the East and Babylonians to the south. In fact, the latter never tired of rebelling against Assyrian rule. As a result, in order to prevent chariots and cavalry from completely overwhelming these settlements, walls were constructed though often from mud or clay since stone was neither cheap, nor readily available. In order to destroy the opponents, these cities had to be taken as well and so the Assyrians soon mastered siege warfare; Esarhaddon claims to have taken Memphis, the capital of Egypt in less than a day, demonstrating the ferocity and skill of Assyrian siege tactics at this point in time: Sieges were costly in terms of manpower and more so if an assault was launched to take the city by force‚Äîthe siege of Lachish cost the Assyrians at least 1,500 men found at a mass grave near Lachish. Before the advent of standing armies, a city's best hope would be that the harvest would force the enemy to return to their fields and therefore abandon the city. However, with the reforms of Tiglath Pileser III Assyria's first standing army was forged and could therefore blockade a city until it surrendered instead. Nonetheless it is known that Assyrians always preferred to take a city by assault than to settle down for a blockade: the former method would be followed by extermination or deportation of the inhabitants and would therefore frighten the opponents of Assyria into surrendering as well. Siege weapons The most common siege weapon and by far the cheapest was the ladder. However, ladders are easy to topple over and so the Assyrians would shower their opponents with arrows to provide cover fire. These archers in turn would be supported by shield bearers.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 22 Other ways of undermining the enemies' defences included mining. A 9th- century Assyrian relief depicts soldiers using ladders to scale walls, while others use their spears to scrape the mud and clay from the walls. A soldier is also depicted beneath a wall, suggesting that mining was used to undermine the foundations and bring the walls down on their opponents. The battering ram appears to be one of the best Assyrian contributions to siege warfare. Although looking nothing like the tougher weapons used by the Greeks and Romans many centuries later, they nonetheless served their purpose. They consisted of a tank-like wooden frame on four wheels. There was a small tower on top for archers to provide covering fire as the engine moved forward. When it had reached its destination, its primary weapon, a large spear, was used to batter away and chip pieces of the enemy wall. While this would have been almost useless against stone walls, one must keep in mind that mud and not stone was used to build walls. Even when dried, these mud walls could be attacked with such engines. Walls were strengthened with time and the Assyrians responded by building larger engines with bigger \\"spears\\". In time, they closely resembled a large and long log with a metal tip at the end. Even stone would not withstand pounding by a larger weapon. Larger engines accommodated greater numbers of archers. To protect against fire (which was used by both sides at the Siege of Lachish) the battering ram would be covered in wet animal skins. These could be watered at any time in battle in case they dried. Siege towers, even ones that could float were reported to have been in use whenever there was a wall facing a river. * Video on The Assyrian assault on Lachish and a water tunnel in Jerusalem.

Elastic instability is a form of instability occurring in elastic systems, such as buckling of beams and plates subject to large compressive loads. There are a lot of ways to study this kind of instability. One of them is to use the method of incremental deformations based on superposing a small perturbation on an equilibrium solution. Single degree of freedom-systems Consider as a simple example a rigid beam of length L, hinged in one end and free in the other, and having an angular spring attached to the hinged end. The beam is loaded in the free end by a force F acting in the compressive axial direction of the beam, see the figure to the right. Moment equilibrium condition Assuming a clockwise angular deflection \\\\theta, the clockwise moment exerted by the force becomes M_F = F L \\\\sin\\\\theta. The moment equilibrium equation is given by F L \\\\sin \\\\theta = k_\\\\theta \\\\theta where k_\\\\theta is the spring constant of the angular spring (Nm/radian). Assuming \\\\theta is small enough, implementing the Taylor expansion of the sine function and keeping the two first terms yields F L \\\\Bigg(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\theta^3\\\\Bigg) \\\\approx k_\\\\theta \\\\theta which has three solutions, the trivial \\\\theta = 0, and \\\\theta \\\\approx \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{6 \\\\Bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{k_\\\\theta}{F L} \\\\Bigg)} which is imaginary (i.e. not physical) for F L < k_\\\\theta and real otherwise. This implies that for small compressive forces, the only equilibrium state is given by \\\\theta = 0, while if the force exceeds the value k_\\\\theta/L there is suddenly another mode of deformation possible. Energy method The same result can be obtained by considering energy relations. The energy stored in the angular spring is E_\\\\mathrm{spring} = \\\\int k_\\\\theta \\\\theta \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2} k_\\\\theta \\\\theta^2 and the work done by the force is simply the force multiplied by the vertical displacement of the beam end, which is L (1 - \\\\cos\\\\theta). Thus, E_\\\\mathrm{force} = \\\\int{F \\\\mathrm{d} x = F L (1 - \\\\cos \\\\theta )} The energy equilibrium condition E_\\\\mathrm{spring} = E_\\\\mathrm{force} now yields F = k_\\\\theta / L as before (besides from the trivial \\\\theta = 0). Stability of the solutions Any solution \\\\theta is stable iff a small change in the deformation angle \\\\Delta \\\\theta results in a reaction moment trying to restore the original angle of deformation. The net clockwise moment acting on the beam is M(\\\\theta) = F L \\\\sin \\\\theta - k_\\\\theta \\\\theta An infinitesimal clockwise change of the deformation angle \\\\theta results in a moment M(\\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta) = M + \\\\Delta M = F L (\\\\sin \\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\theta ) - k_\\\\theta (\\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta) which can be rewritten as \\\\Delta M = \\\\Delta \\\\theta (F L \\\\cos \\\\theta - k_\\\\theta) since F L \\\\sin \\\\theta = k_\\\\theta \\\\theta due to the moment equilibrium condition. Now, a solution \\\\theta is stable iff a clockwise change \\\\Delta \\\\theta > 0 results in a negative change of moment \\\\Delta M < 0 and vice versa. Thus, the condition for stability becomes \\\\frac{\\\\Delta M}{\\\\Delta \\\\theta} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} M}{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta} = FL \\\\cos \\\\theta - k_\\\\theta < 0 The solution \\\\theta = 0 is stable only for FL < k_\\\\theta, which is expected. By expanding the cosine term in the equation, the approximate stability condition is obtained: \\\\theta > \\\\sqrt{2\\\\Bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{k_\\\\theta}{F L} \\\\Bigg)} for FL > k_\\\\theta, which the two other solutions satisfy. Hence, these solutions are stable.  Multiple degrees of freedom- systems  Elastic instability, 2 degrees of freedom By attaching another rigid beam to the original system by means of an angular spring a two degrees of freedom-system is obtained. Assume for simplicity that the beam lengths and angular springs are equal. The equilibrium conditions become F L ( \\\\sin \\\\theta_1 + \\\\sin \\\\theta_2 ) = k_\\\\theta \\\\theta_1 F L \\\\sin \\\\theta_2 = k_\\\\theta ( \\\\theta_2 - \\\\theta_1 ) where \\\\theta_1 and \\\\theta_2 are the angles of the two beams. Linearizing by assuming these angles are small yields \\\\begin{pmatrix} F L - k_\\\\theta & F L \\\\ k_\\\\theta & F L - k_\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\theta_1 \\\\ \\\\theta_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} The non-trivial solutions to the system is obtained by finding the roots of the determinant of the system matrix, i.e. for \\\\frac{F L}{k_\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\mp \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\\\approx \\\\left{\\\\begin{matrix} 0.382\\\\2.618 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Thus, for the two degrees of freedom-system there are two critical values for the applied force F. These correspond to two different modes of deformation which can be computed from the nullspace of the system matrix. Dividing the equations by \\\\theta_1 yields \\\\frac{\\\\theta_2}{\\\\theta_1} \\\\Big_{\\\\theta_1 e 0} = \\\\frac{k_\\\\theta}{F L} - 1 \\\\approx \\\\left{\\\\begin{matrix} 1.618 & \\\\text{for } F L/k_\\\\theta \\\\approx 0.382\\\\ -0.618 & \\\\text{for } F L/k_\\\\theta \\\\approx 2.618 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. For the lower critical force the ratio is positive and the two beams deflect in the same direction while for the higher force they form a \\"banana\\" shape. These two states of deformation represent the buckling mode shapes of the system. See also * Buckling * Cavitation (elastomers) * Drucker stability Further reading *Theory of elastic stability, S.

Preceding structures The Orthodox Church of Ghelar was first made of wood, but it was pulled down in the 19th century. A newly built church made of stone that can be seen today was built by a feudal lord, Gheorghe Berevoii, from Gov√£jdia (a neighboring village) in 1770, built to thank God for having healed his wife. The church is orthodox, although the feudal lord was a Calvinist, and has an outstandingly beautiful painting, which includes scenes from Passion Week and portraying the soldiers that insulted Christ, wearing the clothes of the people who had oppressed the Romanians from Transylvania. Construction A new incumbent of Ghelar began the construction of a larger and more impressive church in 1939, owing to the increase in population. Nerva Florea, from a village in the Apuseni Mountains, was born in 1906. He graduated from the theology faculty of the University of Sibiu (1924‚Äì1927) and the law department of the University of Cluj (1932‚Äì1936). He was a teacher in the town Hunedoara and priest in Ghelari from March 1939. While sitting on a park bench, he had a revelation that when he had graduated from Sibiu that he should build an impressive church. The revelation revealed the entire building, including precise architectural details. Arriving in Ghelari he began building in September 1939 and oversaw the whole building process. He regarded himself only as the architect of the project. The church was founded on a hill in the center of the village near the ancient stone church. It needed 100 kg of dynamite to level the place, this one having been the edge of a stone hill. They laid the foundation of the church in September 1939. Due to the great need of money, the people created in the fanfare of Ghelar (created at the end of the 19th century), and made a tour of country at the big factories to collect money for the building. The walls of the building were raised at three meters in 1945. Between 1945 and 1955 the workings must have been stopped due to the communist persecution that had as a victim the reverend nerve, too. That one had been arrested (but the hand-cuffs couldn't be put on his hands because they couldn't be closed) and jailed, but he was set free because he couldn't have been uncharged. Work was resumed in 1955, and the church was finished in 1973 and hallowed on 3 November of that year. The building was made of brick having the walls with a breadth over one meter, the architectonic style being the one of \\"Greek Cross\\". The architecture combines more style so that the experts can not, two on the front side with a 47 meters height, the most imposing one being that of the middle of the church, i.e. the cupola. The natives made many material sacrifice for the building of the church. The material were brought by the train to base of the hill where is situated the village of Ghelari and by there with an axon cart. Sometimes the people dragged the materials with the aid of an inclined plane, being transported again by the train through the mine drift, then with the cableway (especially built) almost near the church and then with a cart to the place of building, being the only way of communication with Hunedoara town (situated at 18 km). Afterwards a road that connects Ghelari to Hunedoara was built in 1958. The Painting having an area over 4000 meter is made of fresco in the style \\"bunon fresco\\". Every saint that was painted fronts the person who watches him. The iconostasis is gilded with gold and the icons too; this being used over 8 pounds of gold for this purpose. The painter of the church was Constantin Nitulescu and the achievement had lasted for seven years (1960‚Äì1967) in spite of having only five painters. The sculpture made of oakwood was achieved by the artist Ioan Cristea. At the beginning of the 1980s the church began to crack because the ceiling of the laying under the church couldn't support the weight of the church any longer. There was the only one solution to stop the further deterioration of the church: the consolidation which was made immediately the reverend. First he strengthened the whole land by injecting cement in the present cracks, then by surrounding the church with a belt of ferro-concrete. The reverend Nerva Florea died on 22 July 1990 being buried in the church. His death represented the end of many of the plans for the arrangement of the church. The consolidation on vertical line couldn't be done because of the straitened circumstances and the reverend's projects are unachievable nowadays because of the exaggerated price. His dream was to paint the exterior side of the church in mosaic, to surround it by seven artesian well and to make the monumental entrance of marble. The hope of the people of Ghelar is that the church will be as the one in the model from the museum of the church. The church was visited by a lot of people from all the world, people that were impressed by the marvelous church built by the \\"Preot Iconom Stavrofor Nerva Florea\\". The church is always opened for all those who want to visit it.

Early life Meli was born on February 16, 1897, in San Cataldo, Sicily, the youngest son of 13 children born to Vincenzo Meli and Maria Antonia Gugaglio. Meli immigrated to the United States at the age of 17, settling in Scranton, Pennsylvania, working as a coal miner. He worked in a Pittsburgh foundry and moved to Detroit in 1918. His brother Frank and nephew Vincent \\"Little Vince\\" Meli were members of the Detroit Partnership. In 1924, Meli married Jennie Dimercurio, and had two sons, Vincent H. and Salvatore, and two daughters, Maria Antoinette and Angela. In 1929, Meli became a naturalized citizen. In 1945, Meli's nephew, Marie Antoinette Meli, married attorney Bill Bufalino, a cousin of Northeast Pennsylvania mob boss Russell Bufalino. In 1950, Meli's son, Vincent, married Pauline Perrone, daughter of Santo Perrone, a Detroit bootlegger. In 1952, his daughter Maria, married Detroit Mafia boss Jack Tocco, son of mob boss William Tocco. Criminal career In the early 1920s, Meli, Leo Cellura, and Chester LaMare opened the Venice Cafe in Detroit. The Meli Boys excelled in extorting brothels, gambling houses and bootlegging operations. With Meli's assistance, LaMare soon dominated crime in that city. It required an effort by state investigators on recommendations from Michigan Governor, Alex Groesbeck to smash the organization. Thirty-one criminals were convicted of liquor law violations. Meli escaped the crackdown and entered into an agreement with Salvatore Catalanotte, boss of Detroit's Unione Siciliana. With Catalanotte's support, Meli formed the Eastside Mob with top aides Leo Cellura, William Tocco, and Joseph Zerilli. Catalanotte was instrumental in establishing the partnership between the Eastside Mob and the River Gang and other Jewish groups. After Catalanotte's death on February 14, 1930, LaMare began raiding Meli-controlled speakeasies, and liquor storage houses. Meli responded by ordering LaMare's murder, which happened on February 6, 1931. After LaMare's murder, Meli oversaw the merger of Detroit's various mob factions into what later became the Detroit Partnership. After the establishment of the Partnership Once the Detroit Partnership was established, Meli became consigliere. He was a major figure in illegal weapons smuggling and in settling labor disputes. His involvement in labor racketeering helped Jimmy Hoffa's rise in the Teamsters Union. He suffered only one conviction; on charges of carrying a concealed weapon. Meli had extensive legitimate business holdings in the Michigan area. Death Meli died on December 1, 1969, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On December 6, 1969, he was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery, Southfield, Michigan.

She off-loaded between 8 and 10 February; returned to the United States; and was back at Pusan on 2 April. The next day, the ship got underway for San Francisco, but stayed only to embark troops and supplies before beginning the return voyage, via Amchitka, to Japan. The transport made voyages to Korea again in May and August. She returned to San Francisco on 10 September 1951 and did not sail west of the Hawaiian Islands until 1954. Final inactivation and decommissioning APA-30 cruised to the Far East in August and December 1954 before returning to San Francisco for inactivation. She was placed in commission, in reserve, on 7 March 1955 and out of commission, in reserve, on 18 July of that year.

Considered a milestone of nascent Argentine rock, as well as one of the first rock operas and concept albums of rock en espa√±ol, La Biblia centers on the Bible's narrative, starting from Genesis and concluding with the Apocalypse. A preview of some compositions were debuted at the B.A. Rock Festival in November 1970, and the album was presented with four shows at Teatro Presidente Alvear, followed by a tour throughout the country's major cities. The album was Vox Dei's breakthrough and is widely considered their magnum opus. In 2007, the Argentine edition of Rolling Stone ranked it 14 on its list of \\"The 100 Greatest Albums of National Rock\\". In 1974, , who produced the original album, and musician Billy Bond decided to undertake a recording of the album as a proper rock opera. Utilising the classical musicians of the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires, the album featured various important Argentinian rock musicians including Bond, members of the band La Pesada del Rock & Roll, members of the band Pescado Rabioso, Raul Porchetto, and members of the band Sui Generis, all under the artistic direction of pianist and composer Gustavo Beytelmann. Produced by Jorge √Ålvarez, the album, La Biblia, was released in 1974 on the label Talent Cat# SE-515.  Background  \\"La Biblia\\" is considered by Argentinian rock fans to be Vox Dei's indisputable masterpiece; it has been called \\"magnificent for both its music and lyrics\\".Vox Dei - La Biblia The Magic Land Review Guitarist and vocalist Ricardo Soul√© did a terrific job summarizing in just a few lines the most important stories of the Christian Holy Book. Musically the band adopted a hard psychedelic direction, with chiming 12-string guitar and overdriven solos alternating with folky acoustic passages and harmony vocals sometimes reminiscent of The Moody Blues. The Argentinian Archbishop, while at first requesting to review the lyrics, ended up recommending that young people purchase and listen to the album. During the recording sessions, \\"Yody\\" Godoy left the band. To promote the album live, guitarist Nacho Smilari (formerly La Barra de Chocolate) joined the band.

Early life Coat of Arms of Ashbel Smith Smith was born on August 13, 1805 in Hartford, Connecticut, United States, and attended Hartford public schools. He graduated from Yale University at the age of 19 where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa Honor society. Smith taught briefly in a private school in Salisbury, North Carolina and then attended medical school at Yale graduating as medical doctor in 1828. He later lived in France and during the Paris cholera epidemic of 1832, Smith helped to treat the sick and wrote a pamphlet on the disease.Handbook of Texas Online Returning to the United States, Smith began his medical practice in Salisbury, North Carolina. He became active politically and part owner of the nullification newspaper the Western Carolinian. In the fall of 1836, Smith was persuaded to move to Texas by J. Pinckney Henderson, whom Smith had become friends with in Salisbury and was already in Texas. Texas settler Upon arriving in Texas in 1837, Smith quickly became a close acquaintance of Sam Houston and was appointed to the post of surgeon general with the Republic of Texas Army. Even though militarily the Texas Revolution was over, Smith set up an efficient system of medical operations and established the first hospital in the area that would become Houston.Ashbel Smith Papers, The Center for American History As President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston called on Smith to negotiate a treaty with the Comanches in 1838. The Texas Congress failed to ratify the treaty, which would have recognized a Comanche homeland, the Comancheria, thus leading to the Council House Fight and Great Raid of 1840.Johnson, Sid S. Texans Who Wore the Gray. A supporter of public education, Smith was a charter member and first vice president of the Philosophical Society of Texas. The society immediately set about to request that the Texas Congress establish a system of public education in Texas. In 1839, a yellow fever epidemic broke out in Galveston, and Smith treated the victims of the disease while writing reports about the treatment of the disease in the Galveston News. As a result of this experience, he wrote the first treatise on yellow fever in Texas. He purchased land near Galveston Bay and built his plantation, Evergreen, in southeast Harris County in what is now Baytown, Texas.Silverthorne, Elizabeth.

Texas diplomat and secretary of state In President Sam Houston's second term (1841‚Äì1844), Dr. Smith was Minister Plenipotentiary from the Republic of Texas to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and France, residing in London and Paris, respectively. He also traveled to Rome on a diplomatic mission to Pope Gregory XVI. In Europe, Smith secured ratification of a treaty of amity and commerce between England and Texas and improved the Republic's relations with France, which had been ruffled by the so-called Pig War. On his return from Europe in 1845, Smith was appointed Secretary of State by President Anson Jones. With the possibility of annexation by the United States Smith worked to give the people of Texas a choice between remaining an independent republic and being annexed. To facilitate this, he negotiated a treaty, in which Mexico recognized the independence of Texas, won in 1836, and in return Texas would not be annexed by another country. This treaty, known as the Smith-Cuevas Treaty, angered many Texans who were strong supporters of annexation, and Smith was burned in effigy by citizens of Galveston and San Felipe. This treaty was rejected by the Texan Congress which preferred the annexation resolutions, and thus, Texas was annexed by the United States on December 29, 1845 and became the 28th state of the Union in early 1846.The Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association, Vol. IX, July 1905-April, 1906.

He also served as president of the board of visitors to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1848. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Smith returned to Texas and, in 1851, he served as a commissioner from the United States to the London Industrial Exposition. The following year he accepted the role as manager of the first Lone Star Fair in Corpus Christi, lending a measure of credibility to that event.Lone Star Junction In the early 1850s, Dr. Smith worked with Gail Borden to develop and promote a dried beef biscuit. When the Texas Medical Association came into being in 1853, Smith was one of the founders. In 1855, Smith was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from Harris County. In his first term, Smith supported measures to aid railroad construction, validate land titles, improve the common schools. He also served as headmaster of Houston Academy before the Civil War. Civil War Smith supported Texas' secession from the Union in 1861. When it was clear that war was inevitable, he organized the Bayland Guards, also known as Company C of the 2nd Texas Volunteer Infantry Regiment to fight for the Confederacy. He outfitted and drilled the company, and the men elected Smith as their captain. While commanding Company C at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, Smith received a severe arm injury and was cited for gallantry, along with the rest of his company. For his bravery, Smith was brevetted a Colonel and was given command of the 2nd Texas Volunteer Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of Vicksburg, the regiment was distinguished for its defense of a crescent-shaped fortification, which came to be known as the Second Texas Lunette. The fortification was located in the center of the Vicksburg line of defense. Under the command of Col. Smith, the Second Texas Infantry withstood two Union assaults of brigade strength directed against the lunette on May 22, 1863.Lone Star Brigade After the surrender of the Confederates at Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, Smith was in charge of defenses in the vicinity of the Matagorda Peninsula on the Texas Gulf Coast and finally at the end of the war, the remnants of Second Texas was charged with defending the port of Galveston from Union control. After the war: focus on public education At the conclusion of the Civil War, Smith and William P. Ballinger were sent by Texas Confederate Governor Pendleton Murrah as commissioners to negotiate peace terms for Texas with Union officials in New Orleans. In 1866, Smith and his cousin Henry Gillette founded the Bayland Orphanage to care for the children of deceased Confederate veterans.At Rest: A Historical Directory of Harris County, Texas, Cemeteries (1822-2001). Compiled by Trevia Wooster Beverly. Tejas Publications & Research, Houston, 2001. Smith was also elected again as a Democratic Party state representative from Houston to the Eleventh Texas Legislature, serving for one term in 1866. The Texas Historical Society was organized in Houston in 1870 with Ashbel Smith as its president.Houston History According to the Handbook of Texas Online in the 1870s, \\"[Smith] championed public education for blacks and women and was one of three commissioners appointed by Governor Richard Coke to establish an 'Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, for the benefit of the Colored Youths.' This school, located five miles east of Hempstead, is now Prairie View A&M; University. Smith, with Greensville Dowell, reorganized the troubled Galveston Medical College into the Texas Medical College in 1873. As president of the Texas State Medical Association and trustee of the University of Texas, he advocated keeping the medical school in Galveston, arguing before the Texas Legislature that Galveston presented the best opportunity to study diseases. Smith was appointed by the United States Centennial Commission in 1876 to act as a judge on the Jury of Awards at the Great International Exhibition in Philadelphia. In 1878 President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him one of the two honorary commissioners from Texas to the Paris International Exposition.Biographical Data from the Texas State Cemetery Elected to a final two-year term in the Texas House of Representatives in 1878, Smith again represented his home county in the Sixteenth Texas Legislature. His primary focus was the establishment of a liberal arts public university with a first- class medical department. Smith was made President of the newly established University of Texas Board of Regents in 1881. Smith's goals were to recruit the best professors available for the faculty and to establish a curriculum that would make the university, which in the 1880s was still on the western frontier, a distinctive national institution of higher learning. He also saw to it that the medical branch was established in Galveston, near his home. Smith never married. He died on January 21, 1886, at his plantation home Evergreen. In 1886, in a special meeting of the regents immediately after Ashbel's death, the regents passed resolutions affirming the school was the \\"living monument to the high and noble aims of Ashbel Smith,\\" adding: \\"It may be said of him that he was insofar as the practical inauguration of the University is concerned the \\"Father of the University of Texas.\\" He is buried in the State Cemetery in Austin.

Plot Uncle Scrooge catches sight of his two loafer nephews, Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander, from his Money Bin. Although he feels his fortune is secure in the hands of his chosen heirs, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, he feels he should do something for his other nephews, and decides to put them through a test to see what kind of business they would be good at.

At the same time, Gladstone lies around in a hammock reading comic books while amazing opportunities get dropped into his lap. The next day, Scrooge is initially pleased at how well Gladstone has done (to Donald's chagrin), but then a clerk pulls Scrooge aside and tells him that all of Gladstone's opportunities have resulted in losses to McDuck Enterprises.

He is the publisher of Men's Fitness, Muscle and Fitness, Flex, Fit Pregnancy, Shape and Star. He was also the publisher of National Enquirer, Sun, Weekly World News, and Globe. In 2018, Pecker became embroiled in controversy regarding his involvement in a catch and kill operation to buy exclusive rights to stories that might embarrass his friend Donald Trump, to prevent the stories from becoming public during the 2016 presidential campaign. In 2019, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen said he assisted Pecker in this operation. Early life David Jay Pecker was born to a Jewish family on September 24, 1951, in The Bronx, New York City. His father was a bricklayer who died in 1967 when Pecker was sixteen. To support his mother, he started bookkeeping for local businesses in New Rochelle, New York and in the Bronx. He graduated from Pace University. Career After college, Pecker began his career as an accountant at Price Waterhouse and in 1979 joined the accounting department at CBS's magazine division, rising to vice president and controller. Eight years later, CBS sold its magazine division in a leveraged buyout to its manager, Peter Diamandis; Pecker stayed on in his position . Diamandis later sold the magazines to Hachette Filipacchi M√©dias. After Diamandis's departure three years later, Pecker was appointed CEO at Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.. In 1999, Pecker left Hachette when he raised capital from Thomas H. Lee Partners and Evercore Partners to buy American Media, publisher of the Star, the Globe, the National Enquirer, and the Weekly World News. Pecker is the chairman and chief executive officer of American Media, Inc. He is the publisher of Men's Fitness, Muscle and Fitness, Flex, Fit Pregnancy, Shape and Star. He has served in his current role at AMI since 1999 and previously served as Chairman and CEO of Hachette Filipacchi M√©dias; He was also the publisher of supermarket tabloids National Enquirer, Star, Sun, Weekly World News, Globe. Sun and Weekly World News have ceased publication. In 2019, Pecker announced that he had agreed drop more of AMI's tabloids and sell the National Enquirer, Globe and National Examiner to Hudson News. Pecker serves on the board of directors of iPayment Holdings, Inc., Sunbeam Products, Inc., Next Generation Network, Inc, AMI Paper, Inc., and American Media, Inc. In August 2018, after his interactions with President Donald Trump were heavily reported, Pecker resigned as a director of Postmedia Network Canada Corp., a leading Canadian media company, a position he had held since October 2016. In 2016, Pecker revealed to the Toronto Star that American Media Inc. now relied on support from Chatham Asset Management and its owner Anthony Melchiorre due to financial troubles. By the time Pecker agreed to sell the National Enquirer on April 10, 2019, Chatham Asset Management owned 80 percent of American Media Inc's stock. Melchiorre, who expressed dismay towards the National Enquirer's scandals involving assistance to Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign and blackmail of Jeff Bezos, was also instrumental in forcing Pecker and American Media Inc. to sell the National Enquirer as well.  Involvement with Donald Trump  Beginning in March 1998, Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., of which Pecker was then CEO, began producing Trump Style, which was distributed to guests at Donald Trump's properties. Pecker has described himself as a close friend of Trump. Pecker supported Trump's initial run for president as part of the Reform Party in 2000. In an August 2014 meeting at Trump Tower, Pecker offered to Trump that he would use the National Enquirer to catch and kill any allegations of sexual affairs against him. Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen requested that Pecker's AMI buy the rights to Stormy Daniels's story, though Pecker refused to do so. By 2018, Pecker and AMI found themselves under investigation for using catch and kill payments, in which AMI purchased the exclusive rights to stories that might have been damaging to Trump's 2016 campaign for President and then refused to publish them. Such a tactic may have represented illegal and/or undeclared \\"in-kind\\" campaign donations under Federal Election Commission rules. In March 2018, Karen McDougal filed a lawsuit against American Media in Los Angeles Superior Court, aiming to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement preventing her from speaking about an alleged affair with Trump. Pecker had directed AMI to purchase the exclusive rights to the story for $150,000 in 2016, allegedly to keep it from the public. In April 2018 the lawsuit was settled and McDougal was released from the agreement. AMI also agreed to feature her on the cover of another AMI magazine, Men's Journal, in September 2018. In April 2018, FBI agents searched the office and residences of Michael Cohen, in part to search for evidence of Trump's involvement in the payment to McDougal. In July 2018, a tape became public which confirmed this payment; the tape was secretly recorded by Cohen during a conversation with then candidate Trump in 2016. In late 2015, AMI paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a doorman at Trump Tower, to obtain the rights to his story in which he alleged Trump had an affair in the 1980s that resulted in the birth of a child. Sajudin in April 2018 identified the woman as Trump's former housekeeper. AMI reporters were given the names of the woman and the alleged child, while Sajudin passed a lie detector test when testifying that he had heard the story from others. Shortly after the payment was made, Pecker ordered the reporters to drop the story. In April 2018, AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard denied the story was \\"spiked\\" in a catch and kill operation, insisting that AMI did not run the story because Sajudin's story lacked credibility. CNN obtained a copy of the contract between AMI and Sajudin in August 2018, after AMI had released Sajudin from the contract. CNN published excerpts of the contract, which instructed Sajudin to provide \\"information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child\\", but did not contain further specifics of Sajudin's story. Federal investigators subpoenaed Pecker and AMI in April 2018, with Pecker providing prosecutors details about the hush payments Cohen had arranged. In August 2018, Pecker was also granted witness immunity in exchange for his testimony of Trump's knowledge of the payments. On February 27, 2019, Cohen testified under oath to the House Oversight Committee that he and Pecker conspired to \\"catch-and-kill\\" stories which had the potential to damage Trump.  Accusations of extortion by Jeff Bezos and Ronan Farrow  In January 2019, Pecker's National Enquirer published what it called \\"sleazy text messages and gushing love notes\\" between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and a romantic partner. Bezos began investigating how his personal communications reached the paper. The next month, Bezos accused the National Enquirer of extortion and blackmail by threatening to release Bezos' intimate pictures, criminal accusations Pecker denied through an attorney. Bezos wrote that AMI proposed in writing that Bezos state publicly that he and his security consultant \\"have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI's coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\\" In return, AMI would withhold publication of the pictures. Both AMI and the Manhattan prosecutor launched reviews of the accusations. Any violation of law by AMI would constitute a breach of the immunity agreement the company reached with prosecutors in 2018 after the paper agreed to \\"catch and kill\\" a story on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump. Ronan Farrow, a journalist, said he and another journalist received similar demands from AMI. Personal life In 1987, he married Karen Balan.
