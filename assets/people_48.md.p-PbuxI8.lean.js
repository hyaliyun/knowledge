He returned to Iceland after four seasons to captain the IA side again and participated in IA Akranes glory years when they won the championship title five consecutive times from 1992–1996. After the 1997 season he was hired as player/manager at Fylkir and got them promoted in 1999. In the autumn same year he was appointed as manager of IA Akranes which he managed until mid season 2006 when he was sacked because the team were battling in the relegation zone. Ólafur also played briefly with the team but his last game in football was 2002. Under his management IA Akranes won the championship in 2001 and snatched up the VISA-bikar twice 2000 and 2003.

But in start of October 2008 he was announced as new manager of Fylkir and returned to the club where he started his coaching career. After three decent seasons with Fylkir finishing 3rd place in 2009, Ólafur decided to step down from the coaching role after the 2011 season after guiding them to a mid-table finish, allegedly due to disagreement with the Fylkir board over player transfer issues. Ólafur was quickly picked up after the 2011 season, in October the same year, to coach Víkingur Reykjavik. The Vikings had been unfortunate to suffer relegation in the 2011 season and were eager to regain their place among the best.

It is endemic to the island of Borneo. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the Sumatran treepie (D. occipitalis). Description It is a fairly large bird, 40 centimetres in length, including a long graduated tail, broad rounded wings and short weak legs. The underparts are pinkish-brown. The head is also pinkish-brown with a pale silver crown and a dark stripe over the eye and across the forehead. The back is greyish and the rump is pale. The wings are black with a white patch and the tail is grey with black tips to the feathers. The bill and legs are grey-black and the eyes are reddish. The Sumatran treepie differs in having a pale brown back, a dark brown head with a white nape and a thinner bill. The Bornean treepie is a noisy bird with a variety of loud, explosive calls including a bell-like whistle and various grunting and chattering calls. It is able to mimic the calls of other birds. Ecology It is fairly common in most mountain ranges in the northern and central parts of Borneo. It mainly occurs between 300 and 2,800 metres above sea-level, being most common in valleys and foothills at the lower end of that range. It inhabits forest, forest edge, bamboo thickets and scrubland and is sometimes seen in cultivated areas. It forages in the tree canopy, alone or in small groups, searching for small fruit, seeds and large insects such as beetles and cockroaches. It can become tame, visiting villages to feed on scraps. Little is known about its breeding habits. The nest is shallow, built of fine twigs and placed in a low tree. The eggs are greenish-white with brown markings concentrated in a ring at the wider end.

The kidney consists of irregular cysts of varying sizes. Multicystic dysplastic kidney is a common type of renal cystic disease, and it is a cause of an abdominal mass in infants. Signs and symptoms When a diagnosis of multicystic kidney is made in utero by ultrasound, the disease is found to be bilateral in many cases. Those with bilateral disease often have other severe deformities or polysystemic malformation syndromes. In bilateral cases, the newborn has the classic characteristic of Potter's syndrome. The bilateral condition is incompatible with survival, as the contralateral system frequently is abnormal as well. Contralateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction is found in 3% to 12% of infants with multicystic kidney and contralateral vesicoureteral reflux is seen even more often, in 18% to 43% of infants. Because the high incidence of reflux, voiding cystourethrography usually has been considered advisable in all newborns with a multicystic kidney. Cause The cause of multicystic dysplastic kidney can be attributed to genetics. Renal dysplasia can be a consequence of a genetic syndrome, which in turn may affect the digestive tract, nervous system, or other areas of the urinary tract. If the mother had been taking certain prescription drugs such as those for hypertension, this may be a precipitating factor as well. Ultrasound Scan -Vesicoureteral reflux Pathophysiology The mechanism of multicystic dysplastic kidney is a result of an abnormal induction of metanephric mesenchyme. This could be a result of a formation difficulty of the mesonephric duct. Some mutations in genes associated with renal dysplasia (in syndromes) have been determined. The mutations in question occur at EYA1 or SIX1 genes (branchio-oto-renal syndrome). The PAX2 gene is also thought to play a role in MCDK. The contralateral kidney often undergoes hypertrophy. This is believed to be a compensatory mechanism to the non-functional MCDK. About 90% of patients with an MCDK will have contralateral hypertrophy into adulthood. The impact of contralateral hypertrophy on long-term renal outcomes is unknown. Diagnosis MCDK is usually diagnosed by ultrasound examination before birth. Mean age at the time of antenatal diagnosis is about 28 weeks A microscopic analysis of urine in individuals with probable multicystic dysplastic kidney should be done.One meta-analysis demonstrated that unilateral MCDK occurs more frequently in males and the greater percentage of MCKD occur on the left side of the body. Treatment MCDK is not treatable. However, the patient is observed periodically for the first few years during which ultrasounds are generally taken to ensure the healthy kidney is functioning properly and that the unhealthy kidney is not causing adverse effects. In severe cases MCDK can lead to neonatal fatality (in bilateral cases), however in unilateral cases the prognosis might be better (it would be dependent on associated anomalies). Epidemiology In regard to the epidemiology of multicystic dysplasia kidney, the incidence of MCDK is estimated to be 1 in every 4,000 live births, making it rare in terms of the general population.

She was one of the foremost authorities on encaustic painting techniques. Life and career Geller studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and taught there with Karl Zerbe. It was at the Museum School that she began painting with encaustic, a mixture of pigment and hot wax. She first received acclaim as a painter of \\"organic abstractions\\" in the 1940s when she exhibited with a group of other emerging artists later known as the Boston Expressionists. Her work was more abstract than that of Zerbe and other Boston figurative expressionists. After marrying the composer Harold Shapero in 1945, An interview about Harold Shapero and Irving Fine.Driscoll (1952). Driscoll, covering both Geller's \\"one man show\\" at the Boris Mirski Gallery and another by Louis Kronberg, wrote, \\"Taking the lady before the gentleman (to prove that chivalry isn't dead, of course) one finds Miss Geller, in real life, the wife of Harold Shapero...\\" before going on to observe that her style had become more abstract in recent years and praising her \\"flair for rhythm, deftly handled patterning, and integrated composition\\". Geller continued painting and exhibiting, and taught art classes at the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Massachusetts. She was active as a painter for over seventy years. As recently as 2012 her encaustics were shown in a major exhibit, The Future of the Past: Encaustic Art in the 21st Century, at the Mills Gallery in Boston. The exhibit also included a video demonstration by Karl Zerbe and an interview with Geller. Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Danforth Museum, and the DeCordova Museum.

Seiter and starring Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea. Norman Krasna was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story. It was remade in 1944 as Bride by Mistake with Laraine Day and Alan Marshal. Plot When the Titanic sinks, infant Dorothy Hunter (Miriam Hopkins) is left an orphan. She is brought up by John Connors (Henry Stephenson), whose wife was also lost in the disaster. He goes to such great lengths to protect her privacy that, though she has grown into adulthood and acquired the title of the richest girl in the world, the newspapers do not have an up-to-date photograph of her. She returns to America, but her friend and secretary, Sylvia Lockwood (Fay Wray), impersonates her in a meeting with the managers of her fortune. After seeing how happy Sylvia is with her new husband, Phillip (Reginald Denny), she broaches the topic of setting a wedding date with Donald (George Meeker), her longtime fiancé. He is forced to admit that he has fallen in love with someone else and was getting up the nerve to tell her. Since she is not the least bit in love, she congratulates him. However, it is too late to cancel the party in which she had planned to announce their wedding. At the party, Dorothy and Sylvia continue pretending to be each other. Dorothy meets Anthony \\"Tony\\" Travers (Joel McCrea) and, after winning $60 from him playing billiards, takes a great liking to him. However, stung by Donald's confession that he was never sure he was attracted to her or her money, Dorothy decides to see if Tony would prefer her to the woman Tony thinks is her. She does all in her power to encourage him to court \\"Dorothy\\", even lending him money to do so. Connors warns her that she is being foolish, that no man could resist choosing such a seemingly wealthy and beautiful woman, but Dorothy is adamant. Sylvia and Phillip reluctantly play along. Tony is invited to a weekend retreat. Connors, Sylvia, and Phillip arrive a day late, using the bad weather as an excuse to give Dorothy time alone with Tony (though there are plenty of servants at the mansion). By this point, Dorothy is deeply in love. Tony tells her how much he likes her, but then adds that the richest girl in the world \\"wouldn't have him anyway\\". Unable to bear being his second choice, she tells him that he would probably succeed if he proposed, so he does. Sylvia, having been forewarned by Dorothy, accepts him. That night however, Tony sees Phillip sneaking into Sylvia's room. The next morning, he breaks the engagement. Dorothy claims that Phillip came into her bedroom, putting Tony to the ultimate test. When Phillip shows up for breakfast exceptionally pleased with himself, Tony punches him. Then, finally realizing who he really loves, he picks Dorothy up and carries her off to get married in spite of what he believes she did the night before.

Possession is usually expressed as a percentage (for example, 60% for team A, 40% for team B). Ball possession is also the ability of players or team through their acquisition of skills, speed, and confidence to be in control of the ball against the opponent facing the pressure from the opponent. Historically, Dutch clubs (especially Ajax) were famous for dominating ball possession, but more recently Barcelona of La Liga became the best in maintaining ball possession; Germany's Bayern Munich came out second. However, after the arrival of Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich, the team is considered to dominate possession more than Barcelona, which they did during the semi-final of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Xavi is considered to be the most possessive player in recent years. Paul Scholes of Manchester United and England, was also very famous for his passing skills and the ability to dominate ball possession. Teams that play possession football often try to press their opponents high in the pitch, so to recover the ball rapidly. As a result, the defensive line of team that play possession football is usually place very high in the pitch, around the halfway line and not unusually, in the opponents half. When the team loses the ball the defensive line must move rapidly otherwise the team may be subject to dangerous counter-attacks because of their high defensive line. Supremacy in ball possession is generally seen as desirable and useful by coaches, but it is by no means certain that it can guarantee victory; for example, Italian clubs are extremely successful in European football without putting much emphasis on ball possession.

Roughly speaking, the Freidlin–Wentzell theorem gives an estimate for the probability that a (scaled-down) sample path of an Itō diffusion will stray far from the mean path. This statement is made precise using rate functions. The Freidlin–Wentzell theorem generalizes Schilder's theorem for standard Brownian motion. Statement Let B be a standard Brownian motion on Rd starting at the origin, 0 ∈ Rd, and let Xε be an Rd-valued Itō diffusion solving an Itō stochastic differential equation of the form :\\\\begin{cases} dX_t^\\\\varepsilon = b(X_t^\\\\varepsilon) \\\\, dt + \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\, dB_t, \\\\ X_0^\\\\varepsilon = 0, \\\\end{cases} where the drift vector field b : Rd -> Rd is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. Then, on the Banach space C0 = C0([0, T]; Rd) equipped with the supremum norm *∞, the family of processes (Xε)ε>0 satisfies the large deviations principle with good rate function I : C0 -> R ∪ {+∞} given by :I(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^T  \\\\dot{\\\\omega}_t - b(\\\\omega_t) ^2 \\\\, dt if ω lies in the Sobolev space H1([0, T]; Rd), and I(ω) = +∞ otherwise.

They were created originally for the defence of Bombay (Mumbai) and were stationed initially in Pune, but they were soon called upon to quell the Indian Rebellion of 1857. They were deployed to Central India and were part of the 2nd Brigade of the Central India Field Force. They were instrumental in Sir Hugh Rose’s Central India Campaign of 1858, participating in the siege and recapture of strongholds captured by the rebels such as Sagar, Rahatgarh, Jhansi and Gwalior. They received two battle honours for this particular campaign. After the rebellion was quelled, the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred power from the British East India Company to the British Crown. Wide-ranging reforms emanated from this act. The 3rd Bombay European Regiment was disbanded in 1862 and incorporated into the British Army as the 109th Regiment of Foot. Formation Bombay (now Mumbai) was one of the islands that came to Britain as part of the marriage agreement between King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza, the daughter of the King of Portugal, John IV. To undertake the defence of Bombay, King Charles II created the Bombay Regiment of Europeans in 1662.Mainwaring, p. 1 In 1668, Bombay was ceded to the East India Company and along with it the Regiment, creating the Bombay Army of the East India Company that was in effect on loan from the Crown.Mainwaring, p. 30 Between 1796 and 1798 this army was twice reorganized, becoming a formidable force. The Bombay Army by 1808 had grown to a strength of 26,500, comprising 6,500 British troops and 20,000 local troops. In this early part of the 19th century locally raised cavalry also increased the effectiveness of the Bombay Regiment. The officers of the Bombay Army were trained at Addiscombe Military Seminary, England, or recruited from direct appointment. In 1853 the East India Company further increased the size of the force and created the third infantry regiment on 15 November 1853.General Order By The Most Noble Governor-General of India In Council (20 October 1853), Allen's India Mail, p. 13 The 3rd Bombay European Regiment was initially stationed in Poona (Pune), a popular destination for Europeans in the rainy season and very popular with the troops. However, the relative peace they acquired was broken by the Indian Rebellion of 1857.East India Company Register, p. 1833 Rahatgarh Hugh Rose commanded the Central India Field Force to capture Rahatgarh, Garhakota, Jhansi and GwaliorAs part of the Central India Field Force, 2nd Brigade, the 3rd Bombay Regiment departed Poona on 1 October 1857 with the objective of capturing the rebel stronghold of Jhansi. For the early part of the campaign, the 3rd Bombay Regiment spent their time at Sehore before moving on in January 1858 to Bhopal and then to Rahatgarh. On 26 January 1858, the 3rd Bombay Europeans commenced the preparation for the siege by helping with the placement of the artillery in difficult terrain.Maj. Gen. Rose to Col. Green, Following severe bombardment of the fort, on 28 January, the 3rd Bombay Europeans ignored the direct order of the commanding officer and were the first troops to enter the besieged fort. They discovered that their 500 strong enemy had escaped, but before doing so had inflicted atrocious injuries on the European women who had been caught up in the siege.Sylvester, p. 59 On 30 January, Sir Hugh Rose led a detachment of the 2nd Brigade, including the 3rd Bombay Europeans in pursuit of their enemy who were routed at the River Beena by the 3rd Bombay Europeans. The 3rd Bombay Europeans charged and drove the enemy out of the thick jungle. This was quickly followed by the 3rd Bombay Europeans occupying the fort at Barodia. In his report back to England, Sir Hugh Rose singled out the 3rd Bombay Europeans and their C.O. Lt. Col. Liddell for praise. 5 men of the 3rd Europeans were injured in the engagement. Garhakota By 9 February, the 3rd Bombay Europeans were once more heading for action as part of the force to attack Garhakota.Lowe, p. 187 Once they had pitched camp near the fort, the enemy started a bombardment of round shot and rockets.Lowe, p. 191 The rebel sepoys of the 51st and 52nd Bengal regiments advanced in force towards the guns of the horse artillery but were beaten back twice by the 3rd Bombay Europeans and eventually retreated back into their fort. The fort was then continuously bombarded by heavy shells and eventually on 13 February, Sir Hugh Rose's force was successful in causing the sepoys to abandon the fort, which was entered by the 3rd Bombay Europeans early in the morning.Lowe, p. 192 Having been successful with the capture of Garhakota, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment returned to rejoin the 2nd Brigade at Sagar on 17 February, to recuperate before the next phase of the progress toward the rebel stronghold of Jhansi.Lowe, p. 196 During this period of rest, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment were permitted to experiment with a new battle uniform to replace the traditional heavy red and blue uniform typically worn by them. This new battle uniform was developed by the Regiment itself to create stone- coloured cotton shirts and trousers. This was possibly the first time any British unit was permitted to wear a khaki uniform. The experiment was deemed to have worked as the 3rd Bombay European Regiment became known as the \\"Brassheads\\" in recognition of their ability to withstand the high temperatures of India.Lowe, p. 200 Respite was however short and by late February, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment moved north with the 2nd Brigade towards Jhansi. Three more obstacles faced the 2nd Brigade before Jhansi, these being the stronghold of Narut and the passes Mundinpur and Malthon.Sylvester, p. 66Lowe, p. 212 At the pass of Mundinpur, the enemy opened fire on the 2nd Brigade from the hills on both sides of the pass. The 3rd Bombay European Regiment and the Hyderabad Contingent drew the attack and attempted to clear the hills of the enemy. They charged into the jungle while the artillery opened fire on the rebels beating them back from the hills and through the pass.Lowe, pp. 213–214Sylvester, p. 67 Following a brief respite, the 2nd Brigade continued on their route to Banpore and thence to the river Betwa.Lowe, p. 221Lowe, p. 227 Jhansi On 21 March, the 2nd Brigade, including the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, was before the formidable city of Jhansi.Lowe, p. 232 The defences of Jhansi and its fort were reported to look impregnable and the battle plan involved taking the city prior to an attack on the fort. Preparations for a bombardment took place during the 24–25 March and the action commenced on 25 March 1858.Lowe, p. 239 The enemy too kept up their matchlock and round shot fire. The 1st Brigade arrived at Jhansi on the 25th and their artillery added to the bombardment which lasted eight days. Progress was made, with much of the defences of the city and the fort in poor shape as a result of the combined bombardment, but the logistics of battle were kicking in and the continued availability of ammunition was becoming critical.Lowe, p. 240 On 31 March, a force of 20,000 troops of the enemy was reported to be making their way to attack the British and relieve the city.Lowe, p. 244 Battle of the Betwa With the capture of Jhansi previously looking imminent, Sir Hugh Rose then concluded that the relieving 20,000 strong force commanded by Tantia Tope combined with the 11,000 still in the city and fort would outnumber his own force. Rose had little option but to now defend his position on two fronts. A force of 1200 troops was assembled, which included 226 men of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, who now faced the relieving force.Lowe, pp. 245–246 At dawn, a single line of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment together with the 24th Bombay Native Infantry faced the advancing army of Tantia Tope. Rose however, had planned well and each flank of the line had in place field artillery that moved into position to provide cross-fire into the advancing force.Sylvester, pp. 95–98 With Tantia Tope caught off- balance, Rose ordered the 14th Light Dragoons to charge on both flanks and himself rode leading the left flank cavalry attack. As Tantia Tope's forces reeled under the cavalry, the 86th Regiment and the 24th Bombay Native Infantry advanced to complete the rout. The 3rd Bombay European Regiment fought on and by the evening, although with vastly superior numbers, the forces of Tantia Tope was beaten and dispersed with fatal casualties exceeding one thousand men.Lowe, p. 248 Total British losses were fifteen killed in action, of which two were from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment and sixty-six wounded including three from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment.Lowe, pp. 244–253 The siege of Jhansi resumes With the relieving force dispensed with, the capture of the fort resumed. On 3 April the 3rd Bombay European Regiment moved into position to attack the city wall on either side of the Orcha Gate. Two attacking formations of one hundred men each, the left column led by Captain Robison, 3rd Bombay European Regiment, the right by Lieutenant- Colonel Liddell, advanced with great steadiness through a very heavy fire of musketry and wall pieces towards the ladders, on reaching which they were assailed with rockets, earthen pots filled with powder and various projectiles.Brig. Steuart to Ass. Adj. General, CIFF, Lowe, p. 254 But a serious miscalculation had occurred – the ladders used by the 3rd Europeans were found in some instances too short, in others too weak, breaking under the men. The regiment came under heavy fire, who despite some minor success in scaling the walls with many acts of gallantry and being reinforced by another 100 men of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, was eventually forced to retire.Sylvester, pp. 103–104 A parallel attack on the left flank of the fort by the 86th Regiment succeeded in breaching the wall and a party from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment led by Captain Robison followed the 86th through the breach. Lt. Col. Liddell, on finding his ladders of no use, ordered Lt. Goodfellow, Bombay Engineers, to try a bag of powder at a postern but no entry could be effected. By the time, Captain Robison had made good his lodgment, and was followed by the right column. Pushing on for the Palace, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment were engaged in difficult street fighting until the Palace was reached and jointly captured by the 3rd Bombay European Regiment and 86th Regiment, though both regiments suffered casualties when the enemy ignited a powder room causing an explosion.Lowe, p. 257 Although the Palace was taken, the battle was not yet over. A detachment from the 3rd Bombay Regiment was sent to overcome the Afghan troopers who were bodyguards of Rani Laxmibai and although the Afghans inflicted significant casualties on the Regiment, they were eventually all disposed of and the standard of the Rani was retrieved. An English union flag of silk was also retrieved. Lord William Bentinck had given it to the grandfather of the husband of the Rani, with the permission to have it carried before him, as a reward for his fidelity-a privilege granted to no other Indian prince. The soldiers were allowed to hoist the flag on the place.Maj. Gen. Rose to Col. Green, Lowe, p. 259 The fighting in the city continued for a further day culminating in Lieutenant Baigrie of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment announcing that he had entered an abandoned fort, and so the fall of Jhansi was claimed.Lowe, p. 260 Described as a significant tactical victory, the toll on the Regiment was 7 killed in action and 52 wounded.Casualty report, Siege of Jhansi, Lohari With the fall of Jhansi behind them the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, still part of the Central India Field Force, were divided. Part of the Regiment was left in charge of the fortress at Jhansi under the command of Lt. Col Liddell whilst the remainder marched with Sir Hugh Rose in his pursuit of Tantia Tope.Lowe, p. 269 Sir Hugh Rose, on arriving at Poonch, sent Major Gall to the fort at Lohari. The fort and village of Lohari were situated in an extensive level plain. The fort itself was square and flanked by round towers at the corners. It had a ditch and a second line of works outside the ditch. A company of the 3rd Europeans crossed the open space between the village and fort without opposition and established themselves in a guard-house close to the ditch. The garrison of the fort paid no heed to the summons of surrender. Major Gall concluded that no option remained, after reconnaissance, but to open the third gate with a bag of gunpowder and carry the fort by storm. Twenty-five files of the 3rd Europeans, under Lieutenants Armstrong and Donne and Ensign Newport occupied the gateways as the storming party. Lieutenant Bonus, Bombay Engineers, under the cover of sharp fire from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in front of the closed gate, and the firing party withdrew. The explosion occurred and the storming 3rd Europeans rushed in through the smoke and almost immediately met the enemy face to face. The stormers were assailed by a shower of stones and brickbats as well as by men who cut, stabbed and shot at them from the walls. Lieutenant Donne and Ensign Newport were severely wounded while fighting hand-to-hand, but beat off their assailants and retreated under bayonet protection. Lieutenant Rose now came opportunely to the front for a final charge and the 3rd Europeans, with some of the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, drove their foe before them and a bloody melee ensued. A last stand by the foe near the gateway was also crushed. The bugler private, Private Whirlpool, who made it through the gate first in the final charge, later received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. The 3rd Bombay Europeans had a toll of 1 killed in action and 17 wounded.Major Gall to Chief of Staff, Lowe, p. 271Sylvester, pp. 120–123 Konch to Kalpi On 7 May, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment marched off for Konch and thence to Kalpi. This involved marching over with full kit in temperatures exceeding , and in such temperatures there were many casualties due to heat exhaustion, for amongst all the units in the force, only the 3rd Bombay European Regiment marched in lightweight khaki cotton; the rest were in heavy duty red. In the operations before Kalpi, Lieutenant Baigrie, Ensign Mackintosh and Ensign Trueman of the 3rd Bombay Europeans were mentioned in dispatches for their gallantry in action.Maj. Gen. Rose to Col. Wetherall (22 June 1858), Captain Forrest of the 3rd European was also commended for his actions in the capture of the village of Sonorie in December 1858, commanding his troops in fighting against the enemy who used their knowledge of the terrain effectively.Cpt. Forrest to Lt. Col. Liddell, On 14 January 1858, near the village of Dewsa, the 3rd Europeans assisted Brigadier Showers in catching up with the enemy force, commanded by Tantia Tope. The cavalry was able to disperse the enemy in separate directions. They kept up the chase, marching for , before it was halted out of exhaustion.Brig. Showers to Chief of Staff (18 January 1859), The fighting that took place at Kalpi was ferocious with the heat inflicting as many casualties as their foe. Tantia Tope's army attacked the British and at one stage Rose again led from the front as the 86th, the 3rd Europeans and the 25th Native Infantry advanced in the hand-to-hand fighting. The temperature was now recorded as in the shade and all the officers of the Central India Field Force were suffering severe effects of the sun. Yet the Regiment carried on and in the victory of Kalpi, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment contributed much in battle.Lowe, pp. 287–289Sylvester, p. 155 Yet Tantia Tope's army refused to admit defeat. Bolstered by the Rani of Jhansi and her escape from Jhansi, Tantia Tope had captured Gwalior.Lowe, pp. 299–300 Whilst Rose once more took his force off to recapture Gwalior he did so without the 3rd Bombay European Regiment who were initially left to garrison Kalpi, and by the time they arrived at Gwalior on 18 June, the order of battle did not require them in the front line. At Gwalior, the Rani of Jhansi was killed in action and it was not until April 1859 that Tantia Tope was executed.Lowe, p. 301 Celsius Temperatures are way off, should be around 48. Post-rebellion and disbandment The Indian Mutiny was over and in May 1859 the 3rd Bombay European Regiment moved to Mhow, where they learned that the Crown had assumed responsibility of the HEIC and its armies. They were given the choice of either submitting to the Queen's service or be returned to England. The men of the Regiment declined the offer to re-enlist and were sent back to England. In 1862 the regiment was joined by 500 men of the Jaeger Corps who had volunteered from the Cape Colony for service in India on the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. In 1862, on the amalgamation of British and HEIC forces, the 3rd Europeans and the Jaeger Corps were incorporated into the British Army as the 109th Regiment of Foot in Karachi. The formal ceremony took place on 30 July 1862 with a strength of 770 troops commanded by Lt. Col. C.S. Whitehall (former 3rd European). On 3 September 1863, the 109th Regiment of Foot were awarded with the battle honour \\"Central India\\" in recognition for their contribution as the 3rd Bombay European Regiment. On 1 July 1881, as part of the Cardwell Reforms of the British Army, the 109th became the 2nd Battalion, The Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians).Military dispatch no. 28 to Governor-General of India (18 January 1861), Parliamentary Papers v.10, p. 21 NotesReferences=Primary References (archived documents) *Bulletins And Other State Intelligence For The Year 1858 Part III (1860), Harrison and Sons, London Gazette Office *Bulletins And Other State Intelligence For The Year 1859 Part I (1860), Harrison and Sons, London Gazette Office *Bulletins And Other State Intelligence For The Year 1859 Part II (1860), Harrison and Sons, London Gazette Office *Allen's India Mail and Register of Intelligence Vol. 11 (1853), H.

Fetzer also designed the building that houses the Manhattan New York Temple, although the temple itself and spire were constructed 18 years after his retirement. All of Fetzer's temples were designed with single spires (see Temple architecture (LDS Church)). Many of his temples (including the temples in Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti, Australia, and Chile) are similar in floor plan, but differ slightly for a locale-specific flair. The Ogden and Provo temples had nearly identical exteriors with large orange central spires that symbolized the pillar of fire by night set upon a large white building that represented the cloud by day, referring to the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt spoken of in Exodus 13:21–22. The spires of the Ogden and Provo temples were later painted white. Other church buildings Other buildings he designed include the South Visitors Center on Temple Square.Church News, 1 April 1995. Fetzer was also the general supervisor of the refurbishing of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall.Joann Jolley, \\"Century-Old Assembly Hall Is Renovated\\", Ensign, February 1983. Personal life Fetzer was the son of John Fetzer, Sr. (one of six architects for the Idaho Falls Temple) and Margaret Baer. He was the brother of Primary song composer Elizabeth Fetzer Bates. He married June Alma Seyfarth on June 14, 1940, in the Salt Lake Temple. Fetzer died of causes incident to age.

History Ostrich was laid down 10 November 1943 as YMS-430 by the Tacoma Boatbuilding Company of Tacoma, Washington; launched 23 March 1944; and commissioned 10 October, Lt. R. G. Bates in command. After shakedown, she sailed for Pearl Harbor 19 December as part of a screen for a small convoy. She arrived 28 December and sailed 4 January 1945, escorting a convoy to Eniwetok. She then sailed to Ulithi arriving 5 February. She remained in the area until departing 14 June for Okinawa to engage in Minesweeping operations. YMS-430 remained there until 8 September, when she departed for Japan. Arriving at Wakayama, she remained in Japanese homewaters, clearing Japanese harbors and waters of mines, until 16 February 1946, when she sailed for home. She arrived at San Pedro, California, 2 April, and shortly after departed for Charleston, South Carolina, arriving 3 July. There YMS–430 was immobilized and placed in reduced commission due to a lack of personnel. On 10 December, YMS-430 was once again placed in full commission and began training operations along the Southern Atlantic Coast. On 18 February 1947, YMS–430 was named Ostrich and redesignated AMS–29. Ostrich, in company with other sister ships, continued her operations along the Atlantic coast going as far north as Labrador and south as Florida, making frequent port calls. On 7 February 1955, Ostrich was redesignated MSC(O)–29. Besides participating in several minesweeping training exercises, Ostrich also performed hydrographic work on occasion. Ostrich continued in this capacity until December 1957. She proceeded to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she was decommissioned in January 1958. Struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register 1 November 1959, Ostrich was sold for scrap early the next year.

Life and career Andrews began playing guitar at age five, taught by his father, John Andrews of the 1960s band, Mother Earth. At an early age, he began attending shows at the blues venue, Antone's, to see blues musicians such as B. B. King and Albert Collins perform. At age eight, Andrews first went onstage to play guitar with Albert King. Impressed with the young guitarist, King invited him to play with him for his entire second set. That moment sparked Andrews' young career, and he continued to hone his skills in the clubs of Austin, Texas, regularly performing with local musicians such as Jimmie Vaughan. Andrews has performed with B. B. King, Buddy Guy, and Albert King. He has also performed at music festivals such as the San Francisco Blues Festival and Madison Blues Festival with Ray Charles. He has been featured on CBS, Austin City Limits, Texas Monthly, Guitar Player, and Vintage Guitar amongst numerous other publications. He has also toured the US and Europe extensively. At the age of 17, Andrews was signed to Jericho Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Working with the record producer, John Porter at the Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, in 1999, Andrews released his debut album Time to Burn. The first title single scored a Top Ten Rock Radio hit, and Andrews earned the award of \\"Breakout Rock Group\\" in 1999 by R&R; (Radio and Records). The record was supported with a major US tour with artists including the Allman Brothers, The Doobie Brothers, Susan Tedeschi, and George Thorogood. In 2002, Andrews released a second self-titled album produced by Carla Olson. The album was recorded at Willie Nelson's Perdernales Studios outside of Austin. In 2006, Andrews joined Guitar Shorty, on his Alligator Release, We The People. The album won \\"Album of the Year\\" at the Blues Music Awards in May 2007. Andrews toured with Guitar Shorty in that year. In 2007, Andrews released his third album, Feelin' Good Again. The album was recorded in Austin, and was produced by Andrews and Mike Sconce. Andrews wrote all of the songs, and was featured as guitarist and vocalist. He enlisted the drummer Alvino Bennett and Michael Ramos on keyboards. Andrews was featured on a solo album by Paul Jones released on March 10, 2009, on CRS (Europe, Collectors’ Choice Music (USA). Backing Jones on the project were Eric Clapton, who played guitar on two tracks (\\"Choose or Cop Out\\" and \\"Starting All Over Again\\") and by Jake Andrews; Tony Marsico; Alvino Bennett; Mike Thompson; Ernie Watts; Darrell Leonard; Tom Junior Morgan; and Mikael Rickfors.

W. Hawking (1995) \\"Virtual Black Holes\\" It is an example of quantum foam and is the gravitational analog of the virtual electron–positron pairs found in quantum electrodynamics. Theoretical arguments suggest that virtual black holes should have mass on the order of the Planck mass, lifetime around the Planck time, and occur with a number density of approximately one per Planck volume.Fred C. Adams, Gordon L. Kane, Manasse Mbonye, and Malcolm J. Perry (2001), \\"Proton Decay, Black Holes, and Large Extra Dimensions\\", Intern. J. Mod. Phys. A, 16, 2399. The emergence of virtual black holes at the Planck scale is a consequence of the uncertainty relation :\\\\Delta R_{\\\\mu}\\\\Delta x_{\\\\mu}\\\\ge\\\\ell^2_{P}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar G}{c^3} where R_{\\\\mu} is the radius of curvature of space-time small domain; x_{\\\\mu} is the coordinate of the small domain; \\\\ell_{P} is the Planck length; \\\\hbar is the Planck constant; G \\\\- Newton's gravitational constant; c is the speed of light. These uncertainty relations are another form of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle at the Planck scale. Proof: Indeed, these uncertainty relations can be obtained on the basis of Einstein's equations where G_{\\\\mu u} = R_{\\\\mu u} - {R \\\\over 2} g_{\\\\mu u} is the Einstein tensor, which combines the Ricci tensor, the scalar curvature and the metric tensor, \\\\Lambda is the cosmological constant, а T_{\\\\mu u} energy-momentum tensor of matter, \\\\pi is the irrational number originally introduced as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, c is the speed of light, G — Newton's gravitational constant. In the derivation of his equations, Einstein suggested that physical space-time is Riemannian, ie curved. A small domain of it is approximately flat space-time. For any tensor field N_{\\\\mu u...} value N_{\\\\mu u...}\\\\sqrt{-g} we may call a tensor density, where g \\\\- determinant of the metric tensor g_{\\\\mu u}. The integral \\\\int N_{\\\\mu u...}\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,d^4x is a tensor if the domain of integration is small. It is not a tensor if the domain of integration is not small, because it then consists of a sum of tensors located at different points and it does not transform in any simple way under a transformation of coordinates.P. A. M.Dirac(1975), General Theory of Relativity, Wiley Interscience, p.37 Here we consider only small domains. This is also true for the integration over the three-dimensional hypersurface S^{ u}. Thus, Einstein's equations for small space-time domain can be integrated by the three-dimensional hypersurface S^{ u}. HaveA.P.Klimets(2012) \\"Postigaya mirozdanie\\", LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Deutschland : \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int\\\\left (G_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\right )\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,dS^{ u} = {2G \\\\over c^4} \\\\int T_{\\\\mu u}\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,dS^{ u} Since integrable space-time domain is small, we obtain the tensor equation where P_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\int T_{\\\\mu u}\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,dS^{ u} is the component of the 4-momentum of matter, R_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int\\\\left (G_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\right )\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,dS^{ u} is the component of the radius of curvature small domain. The resulting tensor equation can be rewritten in another form. Since P_{\\\\mu}=mc\\\\,U_{\\\\mu} then :R_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{2G}{c^3}mc\\\\,U_{\\\\mu}=r_s\\\\,U_{\\\\mu} where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, U_{\\\\mu} is the 4-speed, m is the gravitational mass. This record reveals the physical meaning of the R_{\\\\mu} values as a components of the gravitational radius r_s. In a small area of space-time is almost flat and this equation can be written in the operator form :\\\\hat R_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{2G}{c^3}\\\\hat P_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{2G}{c^3}(-i\\\\hbar )\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\,x^{\\\\mu}}=-2i\\\\,\\\\ell^2_{P}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\,x^{\\\\mu}} or \\\\Psi(x_{\\\\mu})\\\\rangle=\\\\hat R_{\\\\mu}\\\\Psi(x_{\\\\mu})\\\\rangle cellpadding border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} Then the commutator of operators \\\\hat R_{\\\\mu} and \\\\hat x_{\\\\mu} is :[\\\\hat R_{\\\\mu},\\\\hat x_{\\\\mu}]=-2i\\\\ell^2_{P} From here follow the specified uncertainty relations Substituting the values of R_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{2G}{c^3}m\\\\,c\\\\,U_{\\\\mu} and \\\\ell^2_{P}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\,G}{c^3} and reducing identical constants from two sides, we get Heisenberg's uncertainty principle :\\\\Delta P_{\\\\mu}\\\\Delta x_{\\\\mu}=\\\\Delta (mc\\\\,U_{\\\\mu})\\\\Delta x_{\\\\mu}\\\\ge\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} In the particular case of a static spherically symmetric field and static distribution of matter U_{0}=1, U_i=0 \\\\,(i=1,2,3) and have remained :\\\\Delta R_{0}\\\\Delta x_{0}=\\\\Delta r_s\\\\Delta r\\\\ge\\\\ell^2_{P} where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, r is the radial coordinate. Here R_0=r_s and x_0=c\\\\,t=r, since the matter moves with velocity of light in the Planck scale. Last uncertainty relation allows make us some estimates of the equations of general relativity at the Planck scale. For example, the equation for the invariant interval dS в in the Schwarzschild solution has the form :dS^2=\\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{r_s}{r}\\\\right)c^2dt^2-\\\\frac{dr^2}{ 1-{r_s}/{r}}-r^2(d\\\\Omega^2+\\\\sin^2\\\\Omega d\\\\varphi^2) Substitute according to the uncertainty relations r_s\\\\approx\\\\ell^2_P/r. We obtain :dS^2\\\\approx\\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{\\\\ell^2_{P}}{r^2}\\\\right)c^2dt^2-\\\\frac{dr^2}{ 1-{\\\\ell^2_{P}}/{r^2}}-r^2(d\\\\Omega^2+\\\\sin^2\\\\Omega d\\\\varphi^2) It is seen that at the Planck scale r=\\\\ell_P space-time metric is bounded below by the Planck length (division by zero appears), and on this scale, there are real and virtual Planckian black holes. Similar estimates can be made in other equations of general relativity. For example, analysis of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for a centrally symmetric gravitational field in spaces of different dimensions (with help of the resulting uncertainty relation) indicates a preference for three-dimensional space for the emergence of virtual black holes (quantum foam, the basis of the \\"fabric\\" of the Universe.). This may have predetermined the three-dimensionality of the observed space. Prescribed above uncertainty relation valid for strong gravitational fields, as in any sufficiently small domain of a strong field space-time is essentially flat. If virtual black holes exist, they provide a mechanism for proton decay. This is because when a black hole's mass increases via mass falling into the hole, and is theoretised to decrease when Hawking radiation is emitted from the hole, the elementary particles emitted are, in general, not the same as those that fell in. Therefore, if two of a proton's constituent quarks fall into a virtual black hole, it is possible for an antiquark and a lepton to emerge, thus violating conservation of baryon number. The existence of virtual black holes aggravates the black hole information loss paradox, as any physical process may potentially be disrupted by interaction with a virtual black hole.The black hole information paradox, Steven B.

A member of the court party, later the Tories, he sat for Stamford from 1665 to 1679, and from 1685 to 1687. Most active in Parliament during the 1670s, he and other members of his family were consistent political supporters of Bertie's brother-in-law, the Duke of Leeds throughout several reigns. While he never achieved significant political stature, he did hold several minor government offices: he was a captain in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards until 1679, and a commissioner of the Alienation Office and a customs officer. The death of his wife's brother brought the couple an estate in Waldershare, Kent, where Bertie ultimately settled. He sat for Westbury after the Glorious Revolution, but showed little political activity compared to others of his family. Bertie stood down from Parliament in 1695 and died in 1701, leaving two daughters. Early life He and his younger brother Richard left England after the death of Charles I. As a volunteer with the Duke of York in French service, he fought under the command of Turenne at the Siege of Arras. Lord Hatton reported seeing him in Paris that year, speaking in abusive terms of Charles II, and preparing to carry a message from the Duke of Buckingham to Cromwell. Thereafter, he disappeared from public life until the Restoration. Cavalier Parliament He was commissioned a cornet in the King's troop, Royal Regiment of Horse Guards in 1661. He may have unsuccessfully contested Stamford that year; his father, a royalist, joined with interest of the Hatcher family, Presbyterians, to oppose the borough's principal patron, the Earl of Exeter, but in the event it was Exeter's candidates, William Stafford and William Montagu that were returned. The election was appealed on petition, but the election committee resolved that the franchise in Stamford was limited to freemen paying scot and lot only, and the election of Stafford and Montagu was upheld. After Stafford died in 1665, Bertie was returned at the ensuing by-election. Bertie was not a particularly active member, though certain invocations of parliamentary privilege by him suggest he was solicitous for the honour of the office. He first sat in the fifth session of the Cavalier Parliament, held at Oxford. On the day of his introduction to Parliament, he and his elder brother Lord Willoughby followed their brother-in-law Sir Thomas Osborne in voting against Lord Clarendon's measure for imposing an oath of nonresistance on the whole kingdom, which was thus unexpectedly defeated. Later in the session, he sat on the committee for the act of attainder against Joseph Bampfield and other English republicans in Dutch service. On 14 September 1667, he was made a lieutenant in Lord Hawley's troop of the Horse Guards. During the same year, he was appointed to the commissions of assessment for Westminster and Lincolnshire. Bertie continued to be identified with the court party (the future Tories) for the duration of the Cavalier Parliament. He was named to committees involved with the suppression of Catholicism and Nonconformism, but most of his Parliamentary activity in the early 1670s was related to the Bertie family's interests, or local affairs in Lincolnshire. In 1671, he was appointed to the commission on accounts for the loyal and indigent officers fund. In this role, he and John Grobham Howe were sent to Sir Edward Turnour, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, in January 1673/4 to request that he speed the passage of Sir John Bennet's accounts for the fund at the Exchequer. In early February, he participated in the debate on the conduct Duke of Buckingham, suggesting that the Commons hear Sir Thomas Williams, who had reported Buckingham's condemnation of the King, before seeking concurrence from the House of Lords in their resolution condemning Buckingham. Peregrine's daughter Bridget (pictured) later became Countess Poulett by marriage. Soon after, Bertie married Susan Monins, daughter of Sir William Monins, 2nd Baronet, by whom he had three daughters: *Bridget Bertie (d. 23 March 1748), married on 14 April 1702 John Poulett, 1st Earl Poulett; *Elizabeth Bertie, died unmarried; *Mary Bertie, married first Anthony Henley, second Henry Bertie (d. 1735), her half-first cousin. He was removed from the Westminster commission of assessment in 1674, and was made a commissioner of the Alienation Office in August 1675, replacing Alexander Halsall. During that year, he was the teller against the adjournment of debate on the King's Speech. He was also appointed to the committee to prevent Roman Catholics from sitting in the Lords and Commons. On 15 July 1676, after the death of Sir Francis Wyndham, Bertie succeeded him as captain of a Horse Guards troop. From Osborne, now Lord Danby and Lord High Treasurer, he continued to receive patronage; in July 1676, Danby appointed him a searcher of customs in London upon the death of George Peake, and from 1677 to 1678, he was the receiver of ship tax in Kent. Not surprisingly, given his official appointments, Bertie was identified by his contemporaries with the court party. In 1678, his younger brother Charles was also returned for Stamford at a by-election. Bertie naturally opposed the proceedings against Danby that began in December 1678, but was nonetheless appointed to the committee to consider Danby's impeachment. In the general election of March 1679, Sir Richard Cust, formerly an ally of the Berties, and William Hyde obtained the support of the new Lord Exeter at Stamford. The Exclusion Crisis had weakened the Berties' position; the Stamford electors were now indifferent to the sensibilities of the Court, and Exeter's electoral interest was strong enough that both Charles and Peregrine withdrew from the contest without a poll. Peregrine's Horse Guards troop escorted the commissioners appointed by the new Parliament to disband the standing army through East Anglia in June 1679. Later that month, he resigned his commission and was replaced by Thomas Lucy. The death of his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Monins, 3rd Baronet in 1678 had left his wife co- heiress of the estate of Waldershare. She eventually became the sole possessor, and Bertie was to make his residence there for the rest of his life. In 1680, he was removed as a commissioner of assessment in Lincolnshire and appointed a justice of the peace in the Parts of Holland and Lindsey, and he became a member of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1682. He exchanged his post as a deputy searcher of customs for that of a surveyor of landwaiters in 1683, replacing the late Samuel Cust; he was succeeded by Edward Le Neve. By 1686, he had become surveyor of the searchers instead. Under James II The borough of Stamford was re-chartered in February 1685 to place it firmly under court influence. Lord Exeter was ousted as recorder in favor of Peregrine's eldest brother, Lord Lindsey, and Peregrine and Charles were named aldermen of Stamford. Peregrine was also appointed an alderman of Boston, and was a member of both corporations until October 1688. Both brothers were returned as members for Stamford in the Loyal Parliament, probably without a contest. Peregrine served on six committees in that Parliament, and was made a freeman and bailiff of Oxford in 1687. The Berties, like many Tories, were attached to the Church of England, and forced into opposition by the religious policies of James II. After the dissolution of Parliament, Lindsey suggested that the corporation would return Charles and William Hyde, the latter's candidacy conciliating Lord Exeter's interest. Lindsey attempted to find a place for Peregrine at Grantham on the interest of the Earl of Rutland, who had married their niece Catherine Noel and was recorder of the town. However, it was the sitting MP and alderman, Thomas Harrington, who in fact dominated the Grantham corporation and rejected Peregrine's candidature. After the Revolution After the Glorious Revolution, Peregrine was returned to the Convention Parliament for Westbury on the interest of his half-brother, the Earl of Abingdon. He was one of the minority of the House of Commons who concurred with the Lords that the flight of James II had not vacated the throne; otherwise, he showed little activity in this Parliament. He did propose a motion to except Sir William Williams from the act of indemnity, but the Commons narrowly voted not to except individuals from the act by name. Danby proposed Bertie as envoy to Holland, but William III rejected him as unfit for the post. Bertie was again returned for Westbury in the 1690 election without a contest. A Tory like the rest of his family, his role in this Parliament was overshadowed by his kinsmen, including his more active nephew and namesake, Peregrine Bertie. The disaffection of Danby, now Marquess of Carmarthen, with the other Tory peers seems to have drawn the Berties, to some extent, into opposition to the Court during this time. By 1694, however, Peregrine was writing to Lindsey to suggest that Charles might take the occasion of a by-election at Stamford to put himself in better standing with the Court. In 1693, he gave up his customs surveyorship and was replaced by John Dove. Bertie stood down at the 1695 election and was replaced by his nephew Robert. He died in 1701 and was buried at All Saints Church, Waldershare with his wife, who predeceased him in 1697. His will suggests that he was well-to-do when he died (Bridget and Mary each received dowries of £10,000), and on good terms with his brother-in-law Carmarthen, now Duke of Leeds.

His career spanned more than half a century, beginning with performances in his family's touring theatre company. He then toured extensively in burlesque and other comedies and also appeared in London. In 1895, he toured in South Africa in a musical comedy, The Shop Girl.

Its population is included in the civil parish of Laxton and Moorhouse. It was centred on Ossington Hall, the ancestral home of the Denison family, but the house was demolished in 1964 and all that remains are a few outbuildings and a private chapel that now serves the parish as Holy Rood Church, Ossington. This is a Grade I listed building, originally 12th century and rebuilt in 1782–1783 by the architect John Carr, with minor 19th- century alterations and additions. It includes earlier monuments and stained glass. There is a barrel organ built by Thomas Robson in 1840. Ossington Hall The estate can be traced back to Saxon times, when it was known as \\"Oschinton\\" and then later in 1144 as \\"Oscinton\\". The lord at that time, Roger de Burun, gave the estate to the Cluniac order of monks, when he entered the order as an act of penitence. He neglected to recall that he had earlier made the property over to the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem. A legal dispute followed between the two religious orders, which the Hospitallers won. They retained ownership until the Dissolution of the monasteries around 1539. The estate was eventually bought by the Cartwright family, of whom there are monuments in the church. The house was damaged during the Civil War and in 1753 passed to William Denison, a merchant of Leeds. He and his brother Robert made substantial improvements. William was appointed High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1779.Ossington Holy Rood, History Southwell and Nottingham Church History Project. Accessed October 2014. The house was then inherited by Denison's nephew, John Wilkinson, who changed his name to Denison and made further improvements to it. John Denison's heir was his eldest son, John Evelyn Denison (1800–1873), Speaker of the House of Commons, who held the estates from 1820 until his death in 1873, and was created Viscount Ossington in 1872. After his death with no direct heir, the estate passed to William Evelyn Denison (1843–1916), Sir William Thomas Denison, son of Ossington's brother, and after him to a cousin, William Frank Evelyn Denison, who died two years later. The estates then reverted to Lady Elinor Denison, widow of William Evelyn Denison, until her death in 1939, when it devolved on William Frank Evelyn Denison's cousin, William Maxwell Evelyn Denison (1904–1972). Air base During the Second World War a large Royal Air Force station known as RAF Ossington was laid out on land close to the Ossington estate. It opened on 18 January 1942 as the base for No. 14 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit and was transferred to No. 93 (Training) Group RAF Bomber Command in 1943. In January 1945 it was finally transferred to RAF Transport Command No. 6 Lancaster Finishing School, before it was closed in August 1946. The hall formed part of the accommodation for the airfield. Demolition After the Second World War, the hall fell into disrepair and was pulled down in 1964. Ossington Hall was built in 1729, enlarged about 1790 and demolished in 1964. The gates remain as a grand entrance to a drive that now leads only to the parkland and Holy Rood church.

He held more than 125 patents, receiving his first at age 22. He was foremost an Inventor but also a successful businessman. His tenacity and determination to improve on everyday objects helped enhance the quality of life for established businesses, as well as the average person. His inventive mind and creative genius developed the first Knot Tying machine (No.237,966 ), the low wheeled trotting sulky (No.494,113), the Elliott addressing machine (No.707,961), the pneumatic tire (No.487,874), the ball bearing (No. 483,836) and last but not least the unequal turning of the front wheels or steering knuckle (i.e.- kingpin) that would turn out to be a critical element in the success of the automobile. Inventions Mr. Elliott's first well-known invention was the non-turning front axle and self- equalizing brake system he incorporated on his four-wheel quadricycle when he discovered that the wheels on the bike squealed when turning. That is when he realized that you couldn't just connect the front wheels of a normal pair of bicycles with a tie rod, that somehow the inside wheel must turn at a slower speed than the one on the outside if you were to prevent that squeal. With this in mind, Mr. Elliott went home and into his pantry that was between the kitchen and the dining room, there he fastened a piece of string between the inside surfaces of each door. Then, whether swung to the right or the left, the doors remained parallel and swung exactly the same. Next he shortened the string so that the doors were at an angle, their hinges being further apart than their front edges. Standing in the pantry he pushed the left hand door toward the kitchen and noted that only a small amount of movement in this direction produced considerably more movement to the right hand door. After again closing the doors he pushed the right hand door a small distance into the dining room and noticed that the kitchen door opened again wider than it had before. It didn't take long for him to convert that principle to his quadricycle. It took an imaginative bicycle manufacturer to come up with the steering solution, so simple, that it has remained to this day the basic system of front wheel steering implemented in automobiles worldwide. Although this patent expired in 1907, the records show that a number of early automobile manufacturers paid royalties to Elliott for this invention. Among these were the Duryea, Haynes, and Stanley Elliott's Quadricycle (Velocipede), for which he received United States Patent No. 442,663 on December 16, 1890, featured the non-turning front axle, the unequal turning of the front wheels, a differential rear axle, independent vertical action of all four wheels, and self-equalizing brakes. Many of Sterlings inventions, including the quadricycle, can be found in the Elliott Museum which was founded by his only son, Harmon Elliott.http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/DocumentView.asp?DID=644  Early life  Sterling Elliott was born in 1852 on a farm in Ortonville, Michigan. At the age of twelve years all of the farm work was turned over to Sterling. At the age of seventeen, with help from his mother, Sterling Elliott packed a bag and left home. He walked the 92 miles to Grand Rapids where he arrived in 1869 with about $8.00 in his pocket. His first job in Grand Rapids was to work on the railroad trains selling candy and fruit. In 1870 he went to Chicago where he worked for a wealthy business man, Mr. Matthew Laflin. In Chicago Sterling Elliott was granted several United States Patents on his invention, but he had no shop of his own and contracted with others to manufacture his inventions. Mr. Elliott decided to move to Boston, Massachusetts where he opened his first machine shop. In 1882 he bought some land a few miles west of Boston and moved into his own factory (Elliott 5-11).  Bicycle era  From 1885 to 1896 Sterling Elliott made many products, but his principal products were bicycles and trotting sulkies and as a side line he published \\"The Bicycling World\\" and was President of the League of American Wheelmen and Chairman of its committee that controlled Bicycle Racing (Pridmore and Hurd 10). In 1887 Sterling Elliott made a four-wheeled bicycle which he called a quadricycle and with it experienced all the problems that automobile manufacturers were later to face. Sterling Elliott sold the Elliott Bicycle Factory to the Stanley Brothers of Stanley Steamer car fame and opened the Elliott Addressing Machine Company in 1900 (Elliott 21-25).  Elliott Addressing Machine Company  Sterling Elliott had invented the addressing machine to address his magazine wrappers in 1898. In 1909 Sterling Elliott asked his only son Harmon Elliott to become his partner at the Elliott Addressing Machine Company. Harmon accepted the position and took over management after Sterling's death on February 13, 1922 (Elliott 52).

Sivkov studied from 1966-73 at the renowned Novosibirsk State University in Akademgorodok (Russian: Академгородок), a suburb of Novosibirsk. Sivkov lives and works In St. Petersburg, Russia. Career After completing his training; Anatolii Sivkov in 1976 entered the faculty at the Leningrad Institute of Theatre. In pre-perestroika Soviet Russia Sivkov began to work as a creative director for a number of theatres in Leningrad and Perm. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 his career as an artist grew independently from the artistic mainstream. He is recognized as a member of the Union of Artist of the Russian Federation. Sivkov has participated in exhibitions in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Paris, London, Amsterdam and North America. In 2002 a retrospective of his work was held in Regensburg, Germany. Modernist influences As a student Sivkov yearned to explore outside the teleological-milieu of socialist realism the official aesthetic of the Soviet Union since the 1930s. In a rare public exhibition held in 1967 Novosibirsk he was introduced to the radical work of Pavel Nikolayevich Filonov (Russian: Павел Николаевич Филонов). Filonov was an influential artist of the early Russian avant-garde whose canvases examined the inner substance of their subject. Along with Filonov's analytical art Sivkov’s oeuvre illustrates the influences of Wassily Kandinsky's (Russian: Василий Кандинский) inner necessity, and Joan Miró's biomorphic masses. Work Sivkov's paintings are characterized by a kaleidoscopic complexity of colour, the layered impasto of his palette, and an applied etching technique that reinforces a sense of flatness in his composition. Sivkov’s style is enormously individualistic and is evasive of classification. His art holds a tense equilibrium between unrelinquished expression and compositional exactitude. Colour 250px Sivkov’s art is nurtured by the heavy, garish sumptuousness of his palette. His colours and application of, are powerfully expressive. The eloquence of his colours come to delineate the non-perspectival pictorial space. Combined with the impasto texture of his work, Sivkov's palette effectively creates a technically sensorial opus. Sivkov's Lines Sivkov's line art aesthetic, which he employs by a process of applying a heated needle to his thickly coated canvases, adds a compositional element that distinguishes his style from his contemporaries. His work draws inspiration from the ancient temple reliefs of Egypt and Mesopotamia. This is most evident in his proportionality, sense of imposing permanence and almost exclusively depicting the facial profile of his subjects. A correlation can be inferred in his work between ancient bas-reliefs and line art. Despite the fact that line art tends to be monochromatic Sivkov's engraved lines act in a semi-autonomous relationship from the other elements in his compositions. In this fashion his lines act independently from the artist's palette to emphasize form and outline.

The game is the second game in the Ratchet & Clank series released for the PlayStation Portable and the sixth in the Ratchet & Clank series released for the PlayStation 2. The theme of the game is a spoof of the James Bond series, and is based on the Secret Agent Clank element of Up Your Arsenal. To fit with the James Bond theme, Clank has an array of helpful gadgets and devices on his tuxedo, such as a bow tie that he can use as a boomerang and a rose that turns into a carnivorous plant to devour enemies. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Store in North America but not in Europe or Australia. Gameplay Unlike previous Ratchet & Clank games, Clank's gameplay is more like Ratchet's. In previous titles, Clank's gameplay consisted mostly of brief, puzzle-platform-oriented segments with minor melee combat elements; in Secret Agent Clank, he has weapons and gadgets of his own. Featured are quick time events where the player must press a sequence of buttons correctly to sneak through an area undetected. Giant Clank, wherein Clank transforms into a monster-sized fighting machine, also makes an appearance. Other playable characters Besides Clank, both Ratchet and Captain Qwark are playable in the game, as are the Gadgebots. Qwark's gameplay segments are based on dubious accounts of his own exploits and are more action-based. Ratchet's segments in prison are more like the arena gameplay featured in previous games in the series. The Gadgebot segments require switching between Gadgebots to solve puzzles. Weapons and gadgets Clank has six weapons in his inventory: the Tie-a-Rang, Cuff Link Bombs, Tanglevine Carnation, Blowtorch Briefcase, Thunderstorm Umbrella, and Holo-Knuckles. Also, throughout the game, Clank will find weapons that Ratchet can use. Clank secretly puts the weapons in cakes, then sends them to prison for Ratchet to pick up.PSP Playable Demo Clank has the opportunity to gain access to a snowboard and other vehicles. The player can upgrade Clank's \\"Clank-Fu\\" fighting moves and weapons, similar to the weapons-leveling system in traditional Ratchet & Clank games. The player can learn new techniques, as well as various finishing moves. Plot The game begins at the Boltaire Museum, which houses a precious gem known as the Eye of Infinity. The gem, however, was stolen and Ratchet is at the scene of the crime. Skeptical about his involvement, Clank infiltrates the Museum to find out more about the precious Eye of Infinity. But much to his dismay, Clank finds only coordinates to Asyanica Rooftops. Meanwhile, in jail, Ratchet is forced to fend off his inmates in a battle to stay alive. Clank travels to the Asyanica Rooftops, but is held captive. He contacts the agency Gadgebots to free him. Once freed, he sets to find information about Number Woo, the owner of Asyanica. Although he admits he took the Eye of Infinity, he actually gave the gem to a fellow villain, Countess Ivana Lottabolts. While this is happening, concurrently Captain Qwark is writing an autobiography about the adventures that never happened. He defeats a monster terrorizing the city. Meanwhile, Clank heads to her snowy domain and asks her for the Eye, but in the process is challenged to a dance of death, After avoiding all the traps during the dance, Ivana says the Eye has been taken to Rionosis and it is in the possession of a Kingpin. Armed with the information, Clank escapes on his snowboard. En route to Rionosis, Clank gets a distress call that Ratchet is in trouble. Ratchet is forced to fend off more inmates in the Prison Cafeteria. Clank lands in Rionosis and begins to tail the Kingpin; however, he escapes. Clank is forced to jump on numerous gondolas to reach safety. Clank finds out that the Eye is taken to the Casino. Concurrently, Qwark arrives in Rionosis to continue his autobiography where he defeats the Jack of All Trades. Meanwhile, Clank reaches the Casino's Main Room however he is denied entry due to his not having a password. Back in jail, Ratchet reencourters Slim Cognito (a shady weapon tradesman met in Going Commando). Slim trades the password with Ratchet on condition that he defeats his associates. Once he is successful, Clank gets the password and is challenged to a game of poker in exchange for the box goods he saw earlier in the Casino. But once again the gem has been taken to another destination, this time in the Venantonio Labs. At the end of Venantonio Labs is a scientist who was ridiculed for his inventions. With the help of the scientist, Clank escapes on a speedboat to Fort Sprocket, the real location of the Eye of Infinity. Concurrently Qwark arrives in Venantonio and \\"reminisces\\" his days of performing in the mermaid play. In the prison showers, Ratchet meets the Plumber who was called to fix a broken pipe. He accidentally throws the pipe to another fellow guard. Enraged, the guard, together with the fellow inmates engage in battle yet again. Meanwhile, Clank reaches Fort Sprocket. He makes his way to the main vault but is trapped. He contacts the agency Gadgebots to release him. Once inside he finds the Kingpin went to the Spaceship Graveyard. Clank ventures into the Graveyard and the kingpin finally reveals himself – it is Klunk (his doppelganger from Up Your Arsenal). Klunk proceeds to destroy Clank he manages to escape on a Giant Clank Pad. Qwark arrives in the Graveyard and talks about his adventure in saving the orphanage nuns. Meanwhile, there is chaos in the Jail and Ratchet is forced to defend the other inmates from the enemies. Clank manages to locate Klunk's base of operations on Hydrano. It turns out it is an underwater base. After exploring, Clank finally is face to face with Klunk. Klunk reveals he wanted success by destroying every planet in the universe but saving it in time by Clank (who resembles Klunk) the plot thickens when Klunk will make it seem as if the fake Klunk (Clank) destroys the planets only for Clank (portrayed by the real Klunk) to thwart his plans. They engage in battle. Midway through the battle. Klunk says the Eye of Infinity is poised in the center of the universe, either way if Clank or Klunk dies, Klunk will still succeed in his plans. Qwark manages to move the Eye from destruction and saves the galaxy. The game ends with Ratchet and Clank back in their Megapolis apartment using a vacuum cleaner which resembles Klunk. The camera focuses on the vacuum cleaner's filter. The eyes reactivate, implying he is still alive. Development and release The game was in development before the release of Size Matters. In July 2007, rumors of the game's existence surfaced when David Bergeaud, who composes music for the Ratchet & Clank series, accidentally revealed the game in his online resume. The actual game was not confirmed by Sony until a pre-TGS 2007 conference. Reception The PlayStation Portable version of Secret Agent Clank received mixed to positive reviews, receiving a Metacritic score of 72/100. The PlayStation 2 version received lower score reviews, with Metacritic giving it a 61/100.

Biography  The band came together in 2004 through a mutual love of German krautrock, early electronica, art rock, noise and psychedelia. Other shared influences encompassed elements of noise, repetition, sonics and song which became key elements in The Early Years sound. The band were initially championed by Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens and XFM's John Kennedy, and subsequent radio play brought them to the attention of Beggars Banquet Records. After signing a three-album deal in late 2005, the band released three EPs and their self-titled debut album, all to critical acclaim. Following their debut album release in 2006 they embarked on numerous UK tours and performed at festivals including ), Bestival, Truck and Standon Calling. They recorded various live sessions for Radio 1 and XFM, and toured Europe and the United States including a string of shows in New York and a number of performances at the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. The band went on hiatus in 2008, after which various members recorded two further albums, both of which remain incomplete and unreleased. The full band reformed in 2011 with a new double A-side single \\"Complicity\\" / \\"Fallen Star\\" on Sonic Cathedral and a concert in London. Marc Riley invited the band in for a live session on his BBC 6Music show and Paul Weller - on hearing the band's latest disc - asked them to remix tracks from his kraut-infused album Sonik Kicks. Later that year the band were invited to perform at the inaugural Festival Number 6 in Portmerion, North Wales. In 2014, they performed at the Liverpool International Festival of Psychedelia and the 100 Club in London, releasing a limited edition of 100 cassettes to coincide with the 100 Club show. The band released their second album – simply titled II – in September 2016, ten years after their debut. Self-recorded and self-produced at home in London and Cheshire, it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios. It was released on Sonic Cathedral Records on Double LP, CD and Digital formats earning widespread critical acclaim, with Shindig Magazine hailing it 'a classic from the first track to the last'. The band were invited back to play at the Liverpool International Festival of Psychedelia and a small UK tour was performed in November 2016. 2017 saw the band make festival appearances at Standon Calling in Hertfordshire, Bluedot at Jodrell Bank and Bristol's Simple Things festival as well as a one off London Show to promote the release of their Remixes EP. After helping the band tour album II, musician Mylar Melodies joined the band as a full time member at the start of 2018.

The knot is a disentanglement puzzle in which a group of people in a circle each hold hands with two people who are not next to them, and the goal is to disentangle the limbs to get the group into a circle, without letting go of grasped hands. Instead, group members should step over or under arms to try to untangle the knot. Not all human knots are solvable (see unknotting problem) and can remain knots or may end up as two or more circles.http://mathlesstraveled.com/2010/11/19/the-mathematics-of-human-knots/ An easy way to ensure that the game will end up with a single circle with no nodes is to start from a circle of people holding each other hand, looking all towards the center of the circle, and ask some of them to cross his/her arms and swap his left hand with his right hand grasping again the same neighbors. When the game is successfully completed a certain number of people will appear to be outside of the circle. This number equals the number of people having crossed arms. The challenge is to solve the game several times starting each time with an increasing number of crossed people. The game is recommended for children from 12 years and up, and is best suited to a group of ten or so players. No materials are required. The purpose of the human knot puzzle is to gain team building skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills among a group of people and onto the individuals participating.

Jean Duvet (1485 - after 1562) was a French Renaissance goldsmith and engraver, now best known for his engravings. He was the first significant French printmaker. He produced about seventy-three known plates, that convey a highly personal style, often compared to that of William Blake,\\"inevitably compared\\" says Marqusee, 1976, p 14, \\"inescapable\\" says Blunt. with very crowded compositions, a certain naive quality, and intense religious feeling. According to Henri Zerner, his work has a \\"freedom and immediacy that have no equivalent in Renaissance printmaking\\".Grove Art Online (accessed October 5th, 2007) A degree of mystery surrounds his biography, as there is disagreement as to whether or not he was the Jean Duvet from Dijon who spent sixteen years in the militantly Calvinist city-state of Geneva. Life The Annunciation, 1520. He was born to a Dijon goldsmith in 1485,According to the inscription on the first plate of the Apocalypse series presumably in Dijon itself, which until a decade before had been part of the independent state of the Duchy of Burgundy. He became a master of the Dijon Goldsmiths' guild in 1509, and may have travelled to Italy in about 1519; this is purely an inference from his prints, which show considerable Italian influence. His first dated print is The Annunciation from 1520 (left), although others are probably earlier. A misunderstanding of the nature of a pilaster in this print, which shows a putto wrapped round one as though it were a thin sheet, unattached to the wall behind, perhaps suggests that his understanding of the Italian style was derived purely from prints, books and other objects brought back to France.The Annunciation, Eisler no. 12; see Zerner (1994) p.211. Blunt however points out that one borrowing from Raphael reflects the original in Italy, rather than the several print copies of it, concluding that either Duvet saw the original, or an unknown drawing of it. Although he remained in the provinces, he was appointed goldsmith to both Francis I and Henry II. The first of these appointments was on the occasion of the King's visit to Langres, where he was already living, in 1521; he had been involved in the decorations for the Royal Entry.Marqusee, 1976, p.8 By the next royal visit, in 1533, he was in charge of the festivities and decoration. The influence of pageant tableaus and scenery has been detected in his prints. No identified examples of his goldsmithing survive, though commissions for Francis I and others are documented. He died, probably in Langres, after 1562, when he is recorded as attending a town meeting there,Becker p.99 though Zerner gives his death date as 1561 and Marqusee says that there is no specific documentation of Duvet after the last Geneva mention in 1556.Marqusee, p.9 His last dated print is the Frontispiece of 1555. He was certainly dead by 1570, but some authorities think he was alive until about then - 1570 is the death date given by the Getty Union Artist Names List for example. Geneva theory Henry II between France and Fame, c. 1548 A Jean Duvet from Dijon is also recorded working as a goldsmith in Calvinist Geneva from 1540–56, but most scholarly opinion now believes that this was someone else, probably his nephew. The question perhaps cannot be regarded as entirely settled. The Geneva Duvet was recorded as the son of \\"Loys Duvey, alias Drot de Dijon\\", probably Jean Duvet's brother, who became a Master in 1509. Eisler and Blunt favour the Geneva figure being Duvet himself, followed by Marqusee; Zerner and R. May do not. Yet another Jean Duvet, working as a goldsmith in Geneva, was condemned to death for extortion in Geneva in 1576. The (earlier) Geneva Duvet is rather better documented, working for the city authorities in a number of capacities, and holding official office. Both Langres and Dijon were strongly Catholic centres during the period before the Wars of Religion, and Duvet is recorded in Langres as member of a militant Catholic lay fraternity founded in 1548.Marqusee, 1976, p 8, Blunt:77 If his religious views had changed, Langres might well have been an uncomfortable place to remain. The printer of the Apocalypse was Jean de Tournes; his son, also called Jean de Tournes, moved from Lyon to Geneva in 1585 to escape religious persecution.Tournes ‹turn›, Jean de (o J. Detournes) (in Italian). Enciclopedie on line. Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana. Accessed July 2013.Marqusee op cit p.8 No less than three Duvet engravings depict the Suicide of Judas, an exceptionally rare subject outside full cycles of the Passion of Christ, suggesting a \\"passionate interest in the subject\\", which may connect with personal religious struggles.Zerner (1994), p.223-4 (also for the Eisler dates) Eisler dates these three between 1527 and the end of Duvet's career. On the other hand, it is hard to reconcile the Geneva theory with his appointment as goldsmith to Henry II, who reigned from 1547, and the three plates celebrating Henry and the \\"mystique of divine monarchy\\" in extravagant terms, which may celebrate the re-dedication of the Order of Saint Michael by Henry in 1548.Zerner (1994), p. 215. See also Edict of Châteaubriant for the increasingly anti- Huguenot climate of these years, and the role of Geneva as a centre for exiles. Works All seventy-three prints listed by Eisler are very rare - only seven copies of the Apocalypse with text are known, each with slightly different contents, although impressions of individual prints are commoner, and mostly earlier.By the 1561 edition the plates are becoming worn. Zerner (1994), p. 216. Becker says there are 24 in the series, unlike Zerner and Marqusee. The last print in the Boston series, linked below, is not included in Marqusee. Some individual engravings survive only in unique impressions.Becker p.99 n 5; Zerner (1994), p.215 It is assumed that most of his prints in his characteristic crowded style and round-topped format date from the period 1540-55, based mainly on the 1555 date of the Apocalypse frontispiece. A few simpler but intense prints are usually taken to date from his last years, when his horror vacui, or inability to leave space unfilled, abated somewhat.Zerner (1994), p.223-224 He copied prints by Marcantonio and Mantegna, and his burin technique is especially indebted to the former. A very free copy of Mantegna's Entombment shows him imposing his own vision with complete confidence on the composition of another artist.Zerner (1994), p.212 The Apocalypse series Frontispiece to the Apocalypse series, 1555. His most famous works are his series of twenty-three engravings on the Apocalypse, the frontispiece of which (above) is dated 1555. They borrow heavily from the famous series in woodcut of Albrecht Dürer (1498) but are very different in style - crowded, even confused, but urgent and intense. Eight of the series derive their composition in some way from Dürer.One of the closest is the illustration of St John eating the book in Chapter 10:Duvet and Dürer This was published, with the accompanying text, in Lyon in 1561. Like many of his mature prints these use a round-topped shape. The frontispiece has the Latin inscriptions: \\"Jean Duvet goldsmith of Langres aged 70 made these histories 1555\\" (on the plate on the table) and \\"The Fates are pressing, already sight fails, the mind remains victorious, and the great work is completed\\" (by the swan), suggesting this was last of the series to be completed.Zerner translations (1994), p.216. The Unicorn and other works His other famous work is his series of six prints on the unicorn, still very personal but more lyrical in style; until the nineteenth century he was known as the \\"Unicorn Master\\" after these. Series celebrating the French monarchy and Genesis were left aside after a few plates each.Three on the Monarchy; it is thought that The Marriage of Adam and Eve and Moses surrounded by the Patriarches were for a projected Genesis series. See Becker p.99; Zerner (1994), p.215 Style and Legacy The Fall of Babylon, from the Apocalypse series, circa 1555, Engraving, Plate size: 11 7/8 x 8 3/8 in. Duvet's work contrasts strongly with the sophisticated art produced at the court of Fontainebleau. In its religious mysticism and quasi-Gothic sensibility, it partly harks back to the Middle Ages.Blunt p.75. Duvet's engraving known as Moses Surrounded by the Patriarchs (1540–50), for example, draws on a common medieval theme, the ancestors and antetypes of Christ.Blunt p.75. The driving force of Duvet's composition is the visionary nature of his material, which inspires him to place symbolic expression ahead of considerations of proportion, scale, or space. He also illustrates his texts literally.Blunt p.76. When St. John speaks of a voice \\"as if it were a trumpet\\", Duvet depicts a trumpet blasting into the saint's ear. The urgency and confidence of Duvet's vision triumph over his technical limitations.Blunt p.76. As well as recalling the medieval past, Duvet's work also looks forward to the more agitated style of the art produced during the French Wars of Religion later in the sixteenth century.Blunt p.77. Duvet's work was produced, like that of Rosso and Pontormo in the Florence of the 1520s, in an urban atmosphere of religious excitement, since the town of Langres was in the grip of an enthusiastic and emotional Catholic revival at the time.Bishop Claude de Longwy, Cardinal de Givry, led a Catholic reform movement in the town. Duvet was a member of a devotional confraternity called the Holy Sacrament. Blunt p.77. Duvet shares with those Florentine artists the style of distorted and crowded figures and borrowings from Dürer, though his use of Gothic elements is more pronounced. Some scholars have also compared Duvet's art to that of William Blake (1757–1827). Both were visionary artists with the \\"supreme confidence of the mystic\\"; both were in some ways technically incompetent.Blunt p.77. Duvet is in thorough control of the engraving medium however. Weaknesses in his figure drawing are often similar to those of Blake. They were also both inspired by medieval artists and by engravers of the High Renaissance and drew on Mannerist forms. Blake may have known of the earlier artist, since certain echoes of Duvet's work in Blake's seem more than coincidental.Blunt p.77, traces a possible route for this.

History In 1937, the silver jubilee coronation of the HEH Nizam VII was held here, hence the name. A special gold plated chair was made on this occasion with his crest inscribed. The chair is now exhibited at Purani Haveli. The Nizam, on the occasion, received gifts and mementos. The Royal works and paintings from the Durbar still adorn the building. At the time the world was yet to see another Indian spectacle of pomp and power as that of the Jubilee Durbar, with warlike display of 10,000 Hyderabad troops. Architecture Jubilee Hall The building was designed by Zain Yar Jung. The building has an elegant facade built in the Indo-Persian style. At the center, a small but high stage for the throne of Nizam was built, in the shape of 'Dastar'(Crown) of the Nizam. It is clearly visible as the white square in the middle.

Built to commemorate the jubilee year of the incorporation of the town, it is best known for the natural amphitheatre in its southeastern area, which holds regular concerts and live music performances during the summer months.  Geography  The park is located in the centre of Wrexham. It is bordered by Bradley Road on the west, Ruthin Road on the south, Tenters Square on the east/northeast and Bellevue Road on the northwest.  Regeneration  During the 1970s Bellevue Park was neglected and many of the amenities were in a poor state of repair. A major project was undertaken to refurbish the park back to its original splendour. This was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Urban Parks Project, Welsh Development Agency, and the European Regional Development Fund. The park reopened in June 2000. It now boasts children's play areas, a bowling green which is home to the Parciau Bowling Club, tennis and basketball courts, an original Edwardian bandstand set in an amphitheatre, and a jogging route for walkers and joggers. The park itself has many walkways through mature tree-lined avenues as well as affording some magnificent views of the parish church. The park is well lit and has a number of CCTV cameras installed to deter antisocial behaviour. Bellevue Park has once again regained its popularity with the people of Wrexham. Throughout the summer months a broad spectrum of social events take place, such as music concerts for all tastes and \\"fun days\\" for children.  History  In the late 19th century requirements for a park were identified, although it was not until 1906 that the location of \\"The Parciau\\" was finally secured as an add-on to the existing Ruabon Road cemetery site. It was designed to commemorate the Jubilee Year of the incorporation of Wrexham. The Parciau was developed from 1910, with the entrance gates and lodge being provided by public subscriptions. The statue of Queen Victoria was originally placed in 1905 by the Guildhall, and moved in the 1920s to a location in the Parciau next to the pavilion. The pavilion was converted in the 1970s to provide a community centre. During the Second World War the Parciau was turned over for the production of food to supply school canteens. The bandstand which is built in its own natural amphitheatre was often used for Sunday brass concerts, but by the late 1960s it had become disused and unsafe and was nearly demolished: however, it was refurbished in 1973.

The material may be finite length sections or continuous coils. Decambering resembles flattening or levelling processes, but deforms the material edge (left or right) instead of the face (up or down) of the strip. Processes Decambering may be accomplished by a choice of several processes: The material may be \\"stretchformed\\" or stretched typically 1-2% elongation past its elastic limit, such that the camber is strained out, and the strip relaxes straight. Typically this is accomplished by routing the strip through two sets of 180 degree or more wrap driven \\"bridle rolls\\" with the second rolls rotating faster than the first. Cut strip can be gripped each end then stretched on a static rig with one end being mechanically pulled. The \\"stretchforming\\" process is most suited to thin strip. Wider material can be flat rolled with the rolls tilting such that the \\"short\\" edge is lengthened, with thickness slightly reduced, to equal the \\"long\\" edge. The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self checking features. If the material has residual stress as in toothed bandsaw blades, the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of sawblades with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the tooth gullet, and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge. If the strip is narrow and thick enough, side rolls with guide grooves can be used to bend the material laterally to remove the camber. There are many patented designs of these machines, with the best engaging the material on both edges of the strip over the worked portion, preventing the material from twisting or \\"cheating\\" the corrective lateral bending. Note that camber is often caused by slitting, where slitting knives extend the edge being slit. Outer edges left untreated usually have a shorter length than the inner edges being formed by slitting. The outer mults from slitting will therefore usually have camber, while inner mults frequently will not. Decamberers are cost effective when material is not laterally straight enough to suit a given process, and needs upgrading. Cambered material is usually lower in cost than straight material, and decamberers offer savings in these cases. Various types of decambering machines cater to wide or narrow materials.

Biography Born in Mason County, Kentucky, Boyd came down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to join his oldest brother, Gordon D. Boyd (1802–1850), in Wilkinson County in the southwest corner of Mississippi, near the Louisiana border. James assisted his brother, editor and publisher of The Woodville Republican, a newspaper founded in 1823. The two brothers subsequently came to Jackson when it was a small town and fledgling capital in the 1830s. Brother Gordon Boyd moved up the Natchez Trace to Kosciusko, and James Hervey Boyd settled permanently in Jackson. He was an enthusiastic entrepreneur, first operating a drug store in 1835 and often advertising as an auctioneer. During his second mayoral term in 1843, Boyd married Eliza Ellis (1823–1902), another Kentucky native. The following year, he joined the Presbyterian Church, where he was an elder for nearly thirty years. In 1853, the Boyds built a Greek Revival style cottage, now known as the Oaks House Museum at 823 North Jefferson Street, on a urban farmstead at the city's edge. There they reared six children. Three generations of the Boyd family lived in the Oaks, the last in 1960, when the property was sold to the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in the State of Mississippi (NSCDA-MS).

The three head down and discover a system of cave drawings, including what appears to be a depiction of people fighting off a Plesiosaurus, thus providing evidence that dinosaurs existed at the same time as humans did. However, a flaming meteorite crashes into the lake just overhead, resulting in a cave-in that destroys the cave system and the drawings, while the three scientists are barely able to escape alive. The local sheriff, Steve Hanson, sees the meteorite crash and radios in the incident before continuing on his patrol. Several months later, Sheriff Hanson meets with the three scientists to go search for the meteorite. Turner and Patterson dive down to the bottom of the lake, only to find out that the meteorite is still too hot to recover and has resulted in the entire lake becoming significantly warmer than before, rising to approximately ninety degrees. Somewhere else on the lake, a birdwatcher is setting up his equipment when the monster suddenly rises out of the water, moves onto the shore, and kills him. Two friends, Arnie Chabot and Mitch Kowalski, running low on money, decide to start a boat rental service. Their first customer is U.S. senator Jack Fuller, who rents a rowboat for a quick fishing trip for $20. However, he is attacked and killed by the monster. Arnie and Mitch see the empty boat drifting in the middle of the lake and go out to retrieve it, finding only some large blood stains inside the boat. They bring the boat back to shore as evidence for the Sheriff. Then the sheriff finds many dead animals, and takes the case. Some time later, a performer named Ross Conway and his wife Paula are on their way to a show when their car suddenly begins to break down. They stop at a gas station and learn from the mechanic that their car won't be repaired for several more days. The attendant tells them that the fastest method of transportation at this point is by boat across the lake. The couple heads down to Arnie and Mitch's dock to rent a motorboat for $25 and head out. While out on the lake, they are attacked by the monster, but manage to outrun it due to the boat's motor and run it aground. When the monster pursues them onto the shore, Ross empties the can of gasoline into the boat and sets it ablaze, fending off the monster. Arnie and Mitch, as they walk away from renting the boat out to the couple, begin to argue about their boat-renting service. Mitch claims that he is tired of being bossed around by Arnie, and the two eventually fight. Their scuffle leads to the water, where the two discover the severed head of Fuller floating in the lake just as the Sheriff arrives. As he takes in the head for evidence, he orders them to stay away from the lake, and to not use any more boats. Realizing that the couple from earlier is still out there, Arnie and Mitch head out in another boat to search for them. They eventually discover the charred remains of the motorboat and the distraught couple, both too mortified to explain what happened to them. The couple is taken away in an ambulance, and the Sheriff issues a stern warning for Arnie and Mitch to not head back out onto the lake. At the local diner, the sheriff spots a man who is wanted for armed robbery in the nearest town. During the crime, the clerk and another customer were killed. The sheriff pursues the suspect into the forest. After the suspect drives his car off a cliff and jumps out, the sheriff pursues him on foot. The chase eventually leads them down to the shore, where the Sheriff shoots the suspect in the knee, before stopping to hide behind a tree and reload his weapon. During the brief pause, the monster snatches the suspect, dragging him under the water. The sheriff does not hear the attack happen, but he discovers a large blood stain on a nearby rock. Meanwhile, Calkins's autopsy report comes in, and the coroner notifies the sheriff that the wounds were caused by an animal's teeth and that the attacking animal is not only of a significant size, but also lives in the lake. When the sheriff returns the next day to the location where the robbery suspect went missing, he finds several massive footprints before the monster suddenly emerges. He fires all six shots in his revolver at it, before jumping into his car and driving away. He tells Calkins, Turner, and Patterson about the incident, and his description of the monster fits that of a plesiosaurus. While the three scientists are excited at the idea of a living dinosaur in the lake, the sheriff is determined to kill it before more lives are put at risk. The sheriff, Calkins, Turner, and Patterson host a town meeting in the diner the next day, informing the town of the danger and what they plan to do to stop the monster. Arnie and Mitch ultimately take the scientists' side in favor of keeping the monster alive, saying it'll bring in a significant amount of money for the town. However, a man named Ferguson is attacked by the monster and barely manages to make it to safety inside the diner. The Sheriff, Turner, Patterson, Arnie, and Mitch all head outside to confront the monster, which is just outside the barricade of farming vehicles and a wall of hay bails. The Sheriff starts up a bulldozer, but Arnie attempts to stop him at gunpoint, saying that the monster must live. The Sheriff convinces him that nothing will stop the monster without killing it, and Arnie jumps in the back, shotgun at the ready. As the monster draws closer, Arnie panics and attempts to flee, only to be caught and killed by the monster. The Sheriff slams into the monster with the bulldozer, causing it to drop Arnie's corpse. When it reaches its head down to try to pick up Arnie's body again, the Sheriff drives the bulldozer forward and repeatedly slams into the monster's neck, finally killing it. In the aftermath of the battle, the Sheriff, Calkins, Turner, Patterson, and Mitch all mourn Arnie's death, with Mitch vowing to continue the boat rental service that he and Arnie started, softly repeating \\"our boats...our boats.\\" Cast * Richard Cardella as Sheriff Steve Hanson * Glenn Roberts as Arnie Chabot * Mark Siegel as Mitch Kowalski * Bob Hyman as Richard Calkins * Richard Garrison as Dan Turner * Kacey Cobb as Susan Patterson * Michael Hoover as Ross Conway * Suzanne Lewis as Paula Conway * Marv Eliot as Senator Jack Fuller * Garry Johnston as Blackmailer * Susy Claycomb as waitress * Jim Goeppinger as Villager Production The film suffered from financing and publication problems with Crown International, as Cardella recounts: There was no post work done on the film resulting in day for night scenes being just day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgH1jjhYdnE&pbjreload;=10 Parts of the movie were filmed on location at Huntington Lake, California, and Palomar Mountain, California. Reception George R. Reis from DVD Drive-In called it \\"one of the worst giant monster flicks of all time\\". Buzz McClain from Allmovie wrote, \\"With virtually no budget (not even for a competent tripod to hold the camera steady) and using amateur actors, the movie employs the most laughable devices to render the impression of a raging dinosaur—an immobile rubber head, for instance—and the most unpredictable shuffling of scenes of tension and humor.\\" Andrew Smith from Popcorn Pictures gave the film a score of 1 out of 10, writing, \\"The Crater Lake Monster is nearly as bad as its reputation claims, but the brief stop motion special effects are worth one look... It’s just a shame that these effects are wasted in this hokey micro budget film, and are not displayed in something bigger budgeted and more professional.\\" Keith Bailey from Radio Times gave it 1/5 stars, calling it \\"so slow and shoddy, it makes some of the worst 1950s monster movies look like masterpieces\\".

She is best known as one of the original co-hosts on the ABC morning talk show The View, on which she appeared from 1997 to 2006. She was also one of sixteen contestants of the fourth installment of The Celebrity Apprentice in 2011, coming in fifth place. Early life Jones was born in Badin, North Carolina and grew up in Trenton, New Jersey with her mother, a human services administrator, and her stepfather, a municipal security chief. Jones graduated from Notre Dame High School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. She earned a B.A. degree in Administration of Justice at American University, where she was initiated into the Lambda Zeta chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Jones earned a J.D. degree from the University of Houston Law Center in 1986, and was admitted to the New York state bar in 1987. Television career From 1986 to 1991, Jones was a prosecutor with the Kings County District Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, New York. In 1992, she was elevated to senior assistant district attorney. She was recruited by Court TV in 1991 as a commentator for the William Kennedy Smith rape trial and spent several years as a legal correspondent for NBC's Today and NBC Nightly News. In 1994, she was given her own court show, Jones & Jury, which mimicked the arbitration-based reality format of The People's Court, though with a talk show like set as opposed to a courtroom set. Although the show was canceled after only one year, Jones became the first black person and female to serve as a television arbitrator of a courtroom series. Jones then became chief legal analyst on Inside Edition, where she led the coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case. She was the only reporter to interview Simpson during his civil trial, which she covered for American Journal. The View In 1997, Jones joined The View as one of its original four co-hosts. Jones's nine-season tenure on The View was marked by controversy at times. Jones, who had been diagnosed as morbidly obese, Star Jones' Weight Loss Journey, Oprah.com began to undergo dramatic weight loss beginning in 2003. In a September 2007 essay in Glamour magazine, she revealed that she had undergone gastric bypass surgery in August 2003, resulting in a loss of over three years. Many criticized Jones for her initial dishonesty when she claimed she had lost weight via diet and exercise. Barbara Walters told Oprah Winfrey in May 2008 that she had kept Jones' gastric bypass surgery a secret because Jones had asked her to, and that lying on the show turned the audience off.Star Jones on Barbara Walters on The View, Oprah.com; accessed 24 May 2015. Additionally, when she married investment banker Al Reynolds in 2004, Jones reported her wedding plans on The View for months beforehand, including \\"plugs\\" (public mentions) for her suppliers, such as the wedding invitations, clothing, and airlines. It was later revealed that Jones had pushed product-placement in exchange for receiving those products and services for free.Star Jones says 'I do' to wedding freebies, USA Today, November 10, 2004 ABC claimed that her excessive self-promotion alienated viewers. On April 21, 2006, Jones discovered that her contract would not be renewed for the following season. ABC, Barbara Walters and Bill Geddie then told Jones she could go out on \\"her own terms\\". They had collectively decided for Jones to announce her impending departure on Thursday, June 29, 2006, but Jones surprised her co-hosts by announcing it two days earlier on Tuesday, June 27, 2006 when they returned from their first commercial break that she would be leaving the show. She stated that she would remain on the show through July, and she would not return in the fall. She did not reveal during her announcement that her contract wasn't renewed. After Jones revealed her departure live on air, co-host Joy Behar jokingly said, \\"Who am I going to fight with now?\\" to which Jones replied, \\"I have a feeling you'll have someone else to fight with.\\" Despite this, Walters announced the next day that Jones would no longer appear on the show with the exception of previously recorded segments, publicly claiming feeling \\"betrayed\\" by Jones for unexpectedly making the announcement two days ahead of schedule. In an interview with People, Jones claimed the decision to leave was not hers and that in April, producers told her that her contract would not be renewed. Walters later stated that ABC executives had decided not to renew Jones' contract due to diminished approval for Jones through their market research. Jones's contract was due to expire July 13, but after the program finished on June 27, ABC had discovered Jones had released an article with People magazine about her contract not being renewed, and that the decision to leave was not her own, saying, \\"What you don't know is that my contract was not renewed for the 10th season... I feel like I was fired.\\" The next day, Barbara Walters gave a statement to the audience at the start of the program revealing that she had been \\"blindsided,\\" and that Jones would no longer appear on \\"The View\\". When the series went into summer reruns, only programs in which she had been absent from the panel were rebroadcast. Jones was removed from the opening credits, leaving only Walters, Joy Behar, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Shortly after her dismissal, Jones appeared on Larry King Live to respond to questions about why ABC had refused to renew her contract. Regarding her wedding controversy, Jones insisted that every mention of her wedding had been specifically approved and negotiated by the network, and not in violation of any policy. She also denied that she had caused a ratings drop, and claimed that the ratings during the 2004-05 season were the highest The View had had in the nine years she was a co-host. Jones' departure caused a rift between her and Walters that lasted nearly six years. In May 2008, in response to allegations in Barbara Walters's autobiography, Audition, Jones told Us Weekly: \\"It is a sad day when an icon like Barbara Walters, in the sunset of her life, is reduced to publicly branding herself as an adulterer, humiliating an innocent family with accounts of her illicit affair and speaking negatively against me all for the sake of selling a book. It speaks to her true character.\\" Walters did not respond.\\"Star Jones Slams Barbara Walters As An \\"Adulterer\\" In The \\"Sunset Of Her Life;\\" Barbara \\"Will Not Dignify\\" Comment With Response\\", HuffPost, May 7, 2008.

Background  Abdel-Shafi was born in Gaza, one of six children of Sheikh Muheiddin Abdel-Shafi, head of the Higher Islamic Council Waqf and custodian of the holy places in Gaza and Hebron (from 1925–27). He attended primary school in Gaza; secondary education as a boarder at the Arab College in Jerusalem and graduated in 1936. He graduated in 1943 from the American University of Beirut College of Medicine in Beirut. At the University he joined George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement dedicated to Arab nationalism and the \\"liberation of Palestine\\". Political and community service career=Pre-1948 Abdel-Shafi worked at the British Mandate of Palestine's Municipal Hospital in Jaffa. In 1944-1945 he joined the Desert Army of the British Jordanian Army, then part of a new British Ninth Army intended to open a second front - which never materialized - in the Balkans. Spent the war instead in various locations in Palestine: Al-Azraq, Ashona, Jericho, Gaza, and resigned his commission at the war's end. He returned to Gaza and entered private medical practice. He then co-founded a branch of the Palestine Medical Society in 1945, and participated in the first Palestine Medical Congress in 1946. In 1947 and during the Arab-Israeli clashes following the UN partition plan, he provided medical support for the Palestinian fighters. During the 1948 Arab Israeli war, he ran a clinic in Gaza to serve the refugees who flooded into Gaza in large numbers. During this period he worked closely with the Quakers , who provided humanitarian relief for the refugees until UNRWA was established in 1951. 1948–1967 In 1951 he began his studying medicine at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. He returned to Gaza in 1954, by which time it was under Egyptian rule. He worked as a surgeon at the Tal Zahur Hospital. In 1956, as the Gaza strip came under the control of Israel, a municipal council with Abdel-Shafi as one of its ten (10) members was installed. In 1957 Dr. Abdel-Shafi married Hoda Khalidi, from a prominent Jerusalemite family. 1948. Dr. Abdel-Shafi was appointed as Head of medical services in the Gaza Strip from 1957 until 1960. During this period, he became a strong admirer and personal friend of Gamal Abdel Nasser. In 1960, he returned to his private medical practice. He held a two-year term as chairman of the first Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza beginning in 1962. He was also a delegate to the first all-Palestinian conference (Palestinian National Council) which convened in Jerusalem in 1964 and helped establish the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). He served as a member of the first PLO-Executive Committee (1964-1965). By 1966 he was a leading PLO figure in the Gaza Strip. 1967–1991 In June 1967, Israel controlled Gaza after the Six-Day War. During and shortly after the war, Dr. Abdel-Shafi volunteered at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. He was later temporarily detained by Israel, suspected of support for the military activities of George Habash's new guerilla faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an offshoot of the Arab Nationalist Movement. Abdel-Shafi denied membership, but expressed his sympathy for the group's goals. Upon his release, he refused all co-operation with Israel's plans to tie Gaza to Israel through the development of a common infrastructure. Moshe Dayan expelled him for three months to the isolated Sinai village of Nekhl in 1969. Deported again on September 12, 1970, this time to Lebanon for two months, along with five other prominent members of the Gazan leadership, in retaliation for a PFLP hijacking. He was the founder and director of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in the Gaza Strip in 1972, his own rallying organisation for Palestinian improvement. He was attacked by Islamists, who, in 1981 burned down his clinic.The Economist, October 6th 2007, page 115 During the First Intifada in May 1988 he was one of three Palestinians (the others were Saeb Erekat and Hanan Ashrawi) to participate in Nightline's Town Hall meeting from Jerusalem. It was the first time that Palestinians and high ranking PLO members had directly addressed Israeli and Western audiences. The Madrid Conference and after In 1991, he led the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference and subsequently led the Palestinian negotiation team for 22 months in the Washington talks (1992–93). He broke with the Palestinian negotiating team over the Oslo peace agreement over the question of the Israeli settlements. He was one of the first to predict that the Oslo process would collapse because it failed to tackle the issue of settlements. In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) with the highest number of votes as member for Gaza. He took up leadership of the PLC's political committee. He resigned as a deputy in the PLC in late 1997 to protest what he described at the time as the failure to deal with corruption in the Palestinian Authority. Two years later he initiated unity talks for all factions in Gaza. Following the outbreak of the second Intifada, he urged the Palestinian Authority (PA) to organize the Intifada rather than distance itself from it, and to widen its democratic base by forming a government of national unity. He co-founded the Palestinian National Initiative in 2002 along with Edward Said, Mustafa Barghouti and Ibrahim Dakkak as a national platform for combining the struggle for national liberation and the return of refugees with the values of national unity, democracy and social justice. On April 8, 2007 he was presented with the Palestinian Star of Honor by President Mahmoud Abbas largely for his role as founding member and President of the Palestinian National Initiative. He died from cancer in Gaza aged 88. His funeral rally was attended by various political factions in Gaza in a rare show of unity.

Concert arias have often been composed for particular singers, the composer always bearing that singer's voice and skill in mind when composing the work. Apart from only denoting arias for singer and orchestra, the term is also used to indicate arias which were specifically composed as insertion arias for already-existing operas, either as additions to the score or as substitutions for other arias. These are sometimes performed in concerts because they are no longer required for their original purpose, though they were not, strictly speaking, composed for performance in concert. The concert arias which are most commonly performed today were written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but there are many examples by other composers, such as: *\\"Son qual nave ch'agitata\\" by Riccardo Broschi (written for the famous castrato Farinelli) *\\"Ermina\\" by Juan Arriaga *\\"Ah! perfido\\" by Ludwig van Beethoven *\\"Der Wein\\" for soprano and orchestra by Alban Berg *\\"Scena di Berenice\\" by Joseph Haydn *\\"Infelice!\\" by Felix Mendelssohn  Mozart concert arias  Among the more well-known of Mozart's concert arias are: *\\"Popoli di Tessaglia!\\", K. 316, for soprano, with its two famous G notes (i.e., the G above high C - according to the Guinness Book of Records, the highest musical note ever scored for the human voice) that come shortly before the end. This aria was composed in order to be inserted into Gluck's opera Alceste, and also specifically to showcase the superlative vocal skills of Mozart's sister-in-law, Aloysia Weber, who was only 18 at the time. Sopranos who are able to cope with the aria's demands have been few and far between, and the aria is usually omitted from performances of Alceste. It has been therefore redesignated a concert aria, to be presented in concerts by such rare singers as are able to deliver its fiendishly difficult coloratura. *\\"Nehmt meinen Dank, ihr holden Gönner!\\", K. 383, for soprano. *\\"Ch'io mi scordi di te?\\", K. 505, written for Nancy Storace *\\"Vorrei spiegarvi, oh Dio!\\", K. 418, written for Aloysia Weber *\\"Bella mia fiamma\\", K. 528, written for Josepha Duschek *\\"Per questa bella mano\\", K. 612, for bass, double bass obbligato, and orchestra  References  Notes Sources * * Category:Musical terminology ","title":"Concert aria"},{"id":"13346853","text":"240px Nephrocytium is a genus of green algae in the family Oocystaceae.

It is primarily set in New York City, United States. Plot summary An eccentric millionaire, Cadmus Cole, visits the newly founded offices of Ellery Queen, Confidential Investigations, in a rare incidence of disembarkation from his yacht. The investigation company is actually the brainchild and sole responsibility of his partner, \\"Beau\\" Rummell, an established private eye. The eccentric Mr. Cole pays $1,500,000 as a retainer to hire Ellery Queen for an investigation—the details of which he refuses to divulge, saying only \\"You'll know when the time comes.\\" Upon his departure, he leaves behind a well-chewed fountain pen with which he's signed the retainer cheque. Almost immediately, Ellery's appendix bursts, and Cadmus Cole is reported dead and buried at sea. Rummell, in the guise of Ellery Queen, begins to investigate both the circumstances of Cole's death and his heirs; he soon meets two beautiful young women and the case becomes complicated by romance and the appearance of a claimant under the will. When the claimant is murdered, and Rummell married to one of the beauties, the real Ellery Queen must take a hand and solve the case, using the vital clue of the chewed fountain pen. Literary significance & criticism After many popular mystery novels and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel in the Ellery Queen canon was perhaps influenced by the Ellery Queen radio show and films that were popular at the time; Beau Rummell is never seen again in the canon, and Ellery Queen never opens another detective agency in the books (although he maintains an office in more than one film). \\"Ellery directs his partner in a vague investigation of a recluse millionaire's death at sea.

Major IRD functions are: *Logical CP Management - where IRD dynamically varies logical processors on- and off-line. (This does not apply to zIIPs or zAAPs.) *Weight Management - where IRD dynamically redistributes LPAR weights between members of an LPAR Cluster. (An LPAR Cluster is the set of members of a Parallel Sysplex on a single mainframe footprint.) The total of the weights for the LPAR Cluster remains constant as weights are shifted between the members. (Linux on IBM Z LPARs can also participate in Weight Management.) *CHPID Management - where logical channel paths are moved between members of an LPAR Cluster. IRD's objective is to optimise the use of computing resources while enabling WLM to meet its workload goals.

The titles of the pieces, reluctantly added by the composer after the work's completion upon the request of his publisher, are as follows: The Five Pieces further develop the notion of \\"total chromaticism\\" that Schoenberg introduced in his Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11 (composed earlier that year) and were composed during a time of intense personal and artistic crisis for the composer, this being reflected in the tensions and, at times, extreme violence of the score, mirroring the expressionist movement of the time, in particular its preoccupation with the subconscious and burgeoning madness. The work had its world premiere in London at a Promenade Concert on 3 September 1912, conducted by Henry Wood.Edward Clark, \\"IV. Successes in Berlin, Involuntary Pilgrimage of Arnold Schoenberg\\", The Listener (17 January 1952): 107. At Wood's suggestion, Schoenberg's British pupil and friend Edward Clark (later to become a renowned BBC music producer and conductor) invited the composer to make his British conducting debut with this work at the Queen's Hall, and on 17 January 1914 he conducted it at the same venue.Anon., \\"Herr Schönberg in London.

Echoes of the work appear in The Planets (originally titled Seven Pieces for Large Orchestra), and in the opening of his ballet The Lure (1921), which closely resembles the third of Schoenberg's Five Pieces.David Lambourn, \\"Henry Wood and Schoenberg\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 128, No. 1734 (August 1987), pp. 422–27. Instrumentation The work exists in two different scorings: the original 1909 version for a very large orchestra and the revised version of 1949 which reduces the size of the orchestra to more- or-less normal proportions, \\"giving up the contrabass clarinet, as well as the four-fold scoring of the other woodwinds and two of the six horns\\". This version was published posthumously in 1952.

One scholar holds that Schoenberg's \\"now-famous statements about 'Klangfarbenmelodie' are, however, reflections, which have no direct connection to the Orchestra Piece op. 16, no. 3\\". An attempt to refute this view was published in the same journal issue. Schoenberg explains in a note added to the 1949 revision of the score, \\"The conductor need not try to polish sounds which seem unbalanced, but watch that every instrumentalist plays accurately the prescribed dynamic, according to the nature of his instrument. There are no motives in this piece which have to be brought to the fore\\".

Luminosity functions are used to study the properties of large groups or classes of objects, such as the stars in clusters or the galaxies in the Local Group. Note that the term \\"function\\" is slightly misleading, and the luminosity function might better be described as a luminosity distribution. Given a luminosity as input, the luminosity function essentially returns the abundance of objects with that luminosity (specifically, number density per luminosity interval). Schechter luminosity function The Schechter luminosity function provides a parametric description of the space density of galaxies as a function of their luminosity. The form of the function is :n(L) \\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}L = \\\\phi^* \\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{L^*}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{e}^{-L/L^*} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}L}{L^*}, where L is galaxy luminosity, and L^* is a characteristic galaxy luminosity where the power-law form of the function cuts off. The parameter \\\\,!\\\\phi^* has units of number density and provides the normalization. The galaxy luminosity function may have different parameters for different populations and environments; it is not a universal function. One measurement from field galaxies is \\\\alpha=-1.25,\\\\ \\\\phi^* = 1.2 \\\\times 10^{-2} h^3 \\\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}. It is often more convenient to rewrite the Schechter function in terms of magnitudes, rather than luminosities. In this case, the Schechter function becomes: : n(M) \\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}M = 0.4 \\\\ \\\\ln 10 \\\\ \\\\phi^* [ 10^{ 0.4 ( M^* - M ) } ]^{ \\\\alpha + 1} \\\\exp [ -10^{ 0.4 ( M^* - M ) } ] \\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}M . Note that because the magnitude system is logarithmic, the power law has logarithmic slope \\\\alpha + 1 . This is why a Schechter function with \\\\alpha = -1 is said to be flat. Integrals of the Schechter function Integrals of the Schechter function can be expressed via the incomplete gamma function : \\\\int_a^b x^\\\\alpha e^{-x} \\\\mathrm{d} x=\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1,a)-\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1,b) White dwarf luminosity function The white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) gives the number of white dwarf stars with a given luminosity.

He has performed as a soloist in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and has also released several acclaimed recordings. Glatzer specializes in the literature for solo violin, such as the unaccompanied works of Bach, Paganini, Bartók, and Locatelli, and calls upon his strong academic background in world history and civilization in presenting frequent lecture-recitals of the solo violin literature. Early life and musical training Glatzer was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Fred and Miriam (Feder) Glatzer. He began violin lessons at age five. Glatzer's primary teacher in Dallas was Henry Brahinsky; he pursued additional musical studies with G. Clinton Davis, Marvin Gross, and Leonard Posner. At 14, Glatzer performed a movement of the Violin Concerto No. 4 by Henri Vieuxtemps with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra conducted by Walter Hendl. In 1956, at age 17, he was the winner among all string players and runner-up for the Grand Prize at the Merriweather Post Competition in Washington, D.C., and performed a movement of the Brahms Violin Concerto with the National Symphony Orchestra under Howard Mitchell. Glatzer's playing was strongly praised by Washington music critics Day Thorpe and Paul Hume. Following his graduation from Forest Avenue High School (now James Madison High School) of the Dallas Independent School District, Glatzer attended Yale University, where he studied violin with Joseph Fuchs while earning a bachelor's degree summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in history. Glatzer, a Rhodes Scholar, subsequently earned an honours degree in history from Oxford University. He undertook further music study at the Musik Akademie in Basel, Switzerland, under Sándor Végh. Career In the 1960s, Glatzer performed as concertmaster of the Sándor Végh String Orchestra. He participated in the Prades Festival, where he worked with the legendary cellist Pablo Casals. Glatzer settled in Portugal, where he came to the attention of Maxim Jacobsen, an influential Russian violin pedagogue whose protégés included Benito Mussolini and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. Jacobsen, then in his 80s, chose Glatzer as the young artist with whom he wished to share certain unpublished writings of the great 19th-century Italian virtuoso violinist Niccolò Paganini, which until then had been kept among Mussolini's papers. In these writings, Paganini described \\"secret\\" techniques for producing desired tone colors in his Caprices, Op. 1. Glatzer has since incorporated these techniques into his performances and describes many of them to listeners at recitals and on recordings. Glatzer has performed concerts and recitals in more than fifty countries and on every continent (presumably excepting Antarctica). Most of his recitals include visual components such as films and slides, as well as spoken discourse. He has led numerous master classes and gives frequent presentations for schoolchildren.

It tells of a single mother, the relationship she forms with a jazz musician who has Tourette syndrome, and her young son—a piano prodigy—also with the disorder. The musician and the boy form a friendship, and the film is loosely based upon the experiences of Draper's jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who provided the film's score. Draper, known for her role in Thirtysomething, portrays the mother; Gregory Hines plays the musician; and Christopher George Marquette stars as the young boy. Principal photography took place in 1997 in New York City. The Tic Code appeared at several film festivals in 1998 and 1999, where it won a number of awards. It received a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 4, 2000, and a DVD release in February 2001. Critical response to the film was generally favorable.

Filming The Tic Code was in development for five years before finally being made. Principal photography took place on location in New York City in 1997, on a budget of US$2 million. The film was directed by Gary Winick, who took over after original director Norman René died during pre-production. It was written by Polly Draper, who also produced alongside Karen Tangorra, Midge Sanford, Sarah Pillsbury and Larry Meistrich. Draper based the screenplay on the experiences of her jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who has Tourette syndrome. Wolff's involvement as co-producer ensured the cooperation of jazz club The Village Vanguard, which granted the production permission to use its name and exterior shots of the building. Herman Leonard loaned his collection of photographs of famous jazz musicians, and the Blue Note jazz club allowed its name to be used on fake fliers. Wolff provided the film's score and played the piano. Alex Foster also contributed to the soundtrack for scenes of Hines playing the saxophone.

He also studied tapes of Alex Foster to learn how to finger the saxophone. *Polly Draper plays Laura Caraday, a single mother. *Christopher Marquette plays Laura's son Miles Caraday, a young jazz piano prodigy with Tourette Syndrome. Marquette learned how to play the piano from Wolff. He also studied ticcing from Wolff and watched videotapes, including the documentary Twitch and Shout, to perfect his technique. In preparation for the role, Marquette practiced ticcing in public. The film also features Desmond Robertson as Todd, Miles' friend; Carol Kane as Miss Gimpole, Miles' music instructor and teacher; Robert Iler as Denny Harley, a bully; Bill Nunn and Tony Shalhoub as bartenders Kingston and Phil; Camryn Manheim as Mrs. Lily Swensrut, one of Laura's customers; and James McCaffrey as Michael Caraday, Laura's ex-husband.

Pyrénée is a 1998 French feral child graphic novel (bande dessinée) by Regis Loisel and Philippe Sternis, about a naked feral girl who is brought up in the mountains of the French Pyrenees by a bear. Plot summary When a huge earthquake devastates a town in the French Pyrenees, a bear escapes from a circus in the confusion and later finds a small girl whose mother has been killed in the quake. The bear rescues the girl (and her teddy bear) and raises her as his own cub like a female version of Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli, high in the inaccessible mountains, naming her “Pyrénée” after them. They came to a place where little Pyrénée took off his collar to set the bear free, and found the cave. Later on she also learns philosophy and wisdom from a blind old eagle, taught herself as a hunter and a fisherman, and eventually - like Mowgli - has to try to make her way back to human society.

History Merchant Taylors' Girls' School was established in 1888, having inherited the buildings from the boys' school that had moved less than a mile away in 1874. The then governing body was dilatory in providing for the 'new' school and it was due to the insistence of James Fenning, the Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, that the girls' school was started. At the School's opening all of the female staff were graduates. This was a feat, considering that at the time only four universities granted degrees to women. In June 1888, twelve pupils attended the school, by the 1920s it had grown to 300 and, in 2014, the figure has almost doubled. The continuing increase in pupil numbers enabled the purchase in 1911 of the adjoining house, \\"The Mulberries\\", which doubled the existing space. One of the buildings is the now Grade II-listed 1620s building (currently housing the library). Two generous donations from a former headmistress ensured further development of facilities forming the basis of the network of buildings. The early prefect system was replaced in 1972 with the more democratic system of Sixth Form committees still in place today. In 2008, the House System was reintroduced and the four houses were renamed Minerva, Thalia, Gaia and Selene. The houses compete as they have since 1917 in points, academia, and sports. Latin was taught at the school from the beginning, as was mathematics, although if students chose to study higher mathematics they had to be chaperoned up to the boys' school. Early governors of the school insisted that the girls learnt traditional female pastimes alongside these more rigorous subjects, hence sewing, cooking and singing all played their part on the curriculum. Sport ranges from hockey, hill-rambling, badminton, cross-country running and rowing to self-defence. Organisation As of 2013, it has 511 pupils, ranging in age from 11 to 18. The current headmistress is Mrs Claire Tao. The school also has an associated prep school, Stanfield Mixed Infants and Junior Girls' School, which takes both boys aged 4–7 and girls aged 4 to 11. After attending the mixed infants school, the boys go on to the Junior section of Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby, less than a mile down the road. The school is one of nine with links to the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, including boys' school Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby. The school's motto is that of the Worshipful Company: Concordia Parvae Res Crescunt. (Small things grow in harmony.) The school is independently run and charges tuition fees of £11,733 per year.http://www.merchanttaylors.com/key- information/admissions/ Fees were partially subsidised by the Government under the Assisted Places Scheme until the closure of that scheme in 2001. The Schools now run their own means tested Assisted Places Scheme under which about 20% of pupils benefit from free, or reduced-fee places. The schools offer around £1 million a year in bursaries. About 17 per cent of pupils at the two senior schools receive assistance, worth up to 100 per cent of the annual fees. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association. Headmistress Mrs Louise Robinson was President of the Association in 2012. In 2013, Merchant Taylors’ was Crosby’s best performing school with 100% of pupils at the Girls’ school achieving five Cs or above in any subject at GCSE. Community links Links with the local community have always been important. In 1911 the school adopted a 'waif' from the local children's home and formed a link which continued beyond the 1940s. A war effort was also undertaken during WW2, making camouflage netting, scrubbing floors at local hospitals and raising money for 'Warships Week'. Today's Sixth Formers continue this tradition by helping local schools, charity shops and nursing homes. Exchange programme Merchant Taylors is partnered through the British Council's Connecting Classrooms Programme with Nelson Mandela High School, Sierra Leone. Since 2010, the schools have participated in exchange visits. The partnership has enabled Nelson Mandela High to become a 'Sustainable School'. Sport=Rowing The school (along with the associated boys' school) runs the Merchant Taylors' School Boat Club which is affiliated to British Rowing (boat code MTS). The school competes in the British Rowing Championships. The junior under 14 double scull won the national title at the 2015 British Rowing Junior Championships and the junior under 15 double scull (composite with Trafford RC) won the national title at the 2016 British Rowing Junior Championships.

In 1867 he published another newspaper called \\"El Radical\\" that only lasted until 1873. After El Radical he published another newspaper called El Ahuizote. In 1876 he resigned as governor to dedicate himself to writing. In 1884, he was accused of conspiracy and was imprisoned, where he wrote his second volume of what became the five- volume México a través de los siglos. After prison Riva Palacio retired from the military and left for Spain where he met Spanish artists and politicians. In 1896, Vicente Riva Palacio died in Madrid.

Career Finlayson joined London club Millwall after a trial in February 1948 and quickly made his league debut against West Bromwich Albion on 28 February aged 17. He remained with the Lions for six full seasons in the Third Division. In one notable game against Walsall, he was taken to hospital with the team losing 1-3, only to return patched up during the second half and play on to help the side to a 6-5 win. He was first choice at The Den, making 251 appearances in total, a figure that would likely have been higher but for his time on National Service in the Royal Air Force where he played in the same football team as Ron Flowers.Report by Tim Nash. He was sold to First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1956 for £3,000, primarily as cover for England international Bert Williams. He made 13 appearances in his first season at Molineux, and his performances earned him the first choice spot during the 1957–58 season as the club won the league title. The goalkeeper kept his place the following season as he picked up yet another league title winners' medal. He added an FA Cup winners' medal when Wolves defeated Blackburn Rovers 3–0 in the 1960 FA Cup final. The club's domestic success meant Finlayson played in the European Cup against the likes of Barcelona. Finlayson announced his retirement in May 1964 after playing 203 games in total for Wolves. After his playing retirement, he went on to become a successful businessman with his steel stockholding company, R & F Steel Stockholders of Kingswinford. He also spent a brief spell back at Wolves as vice-chairman during 1982, following an attempt to buy the club in 1981 with Doug Ellis which was outbid by the Bhatti Brothers.

Lyons (1960) and O'Brien (1957) have Blane. Walker (1978) has Blaine. The Times usually has Blane but sometimes Blaine. The Freeman's Journal (13 January 1899) actually has Blane and Blaine on the same page (p.6). Blane is used here because it occurs most often and is the version given in the 1911 Census return. (c.1850–7 February 1917) was an Irish nationalist politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for South Armagh, 1885–92. He was a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell during the Split in the Irish Parliamentary Party, and later a pioneering Socialist. In 1876 he was appointed agent to the Catholic Registration Association, an organization dedicated to maximising the Catholic vote. He was also president of the Prisoners’ Aid Society.The Times, 1/12/1885 and 5 July 1892 Early life Blane was the son of Alexander (of County Armagh and of Sydney, Australia) and Bridget (of County Armagh) Slane. He was born about 1850The Times stated on 1 December 1885, that Blane was then ‘about 30 years old’, but Blane himself gave his age as 61 in the Census of 1911, indicating a birth date about 1850. and was a native of the city of Armagh. Blane was educated by the Christian Brothers at Greenpark. He became a master tailor. Political career In 1881 Blane was asked by the Land League at Armagh to stand for parliament for the county if there was an election, without result. Tim Healy claimed in his 1928 memoirs to have helped nominate Blane as an Irish Parliamentary Party candidate in 1885: :\\"During the General Election, the late Alex Blane, a tailor, was returned for S. Armagh as a member of the Irish Party. At Parnell's urging I went to the Convention there, which was to choose the candidate. He wanted to keep out a man named Dempsey, although Dempsey had been his nominee for Co. Derry in 1882. Meanwhile, he was supposed to have become a Davittite. An anti-Davitt prejudice swayed the minds of James O'Kelly and T. P. O'Connor, who had become the inspirers of Parnell in such affairs. Their nominee was Ivor McGuinness, of Poyntz Pass. Objections were raised against him, and I avoided putting the issue as long as I could as the Armagh priests favoured Dempsey. For this the late Canon Quinn, P.P., described me as the \\"most tyrannical chairman he ever knew.\\" His attack was just, but he knew nothing of my \\"sailing orders.\\" Parnell's dislike of Dempsey had been fanned, on anti-Davitt grounds, and I dared not allow him to be accepted as a candidate, if a substitute could be found. :In my perplexity, after some hours' contention, I turned to Father McElvogue, C.C., and asked, \\"Have you no local man on whom you could unite?\\" He replied, \\"Did you see a chap on a ladder in his shirt-sleeves putting up the decorations as you came in? \\" \\"Yes\\", said I. \\"Well, that fellow is good at registration and election work. His name is Alex Blane. He is a tailor, and his father was a Protestant.\\"Healy's memoirs chapter 18 Subsequently, in November 1885 he was returned unopposed as Nationalist MP for South Armagh, and was again unopposed in 1886. He helped organise the Plan of Campaign, aimed at agricultural rent reductions, in Gweedore, Co. Donegal, together with the local priest, Father James McFadden, and the two of them were put on trial at Dunfanaghy in January 1888 as a result. Blane was sentenced under the Irish Coercion Act to four months imprisonment, increased on appeal in April 1888 to six months. The Chief Secretary for Ireland, Arthur Balfour, was challenged in the House of Commons when he said that the sentence had been reduced. He responded ‘The original sentence, I believe, was four months with hard labour, and the new sentence was 6 months, without hard labour, I believe, and I say that is not an increase of the sentence, but it is a matter of taste’. Blane's health suffered from his imprisonment and he was released three weeks early as a result. In 1888 the Irish-American Catholic journalist WH Hurlbert investigated the situation in Gweedore in some detail.Hurlbert W., \\"Ireland under Coercion\\" 1888 pp.66-121 online. IPP split in 1890 When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over the Parnell's leadership, Blane supported Parnell. At the general election of 1892, Blane stood as a Parnellite both in his own seat of South Armagh, and in North Westmeath. South Armagh was a three-way fight, with Parnellite, Anti-Parnellite and Unionist candidates. Blane received only 59 votes, just over 1 per cent of the votes cast. This electoral performance was not uniquely bad; all four Parnellite candidates in the province of Ulster at this election performed almost equally poorly, the best score being 123 votes at Mid Tyrone. North Westmeath was a straight fight between Parnellite and Anti-Parnellite, but Blane lost heavily here also, with under 12 per cent of the vote. Blane was unusual in being a working-class member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and seems to have encountered some prejudice as a result. Parnell is reported to have said, on encountering him for the first time, ‘Who is that convict-looking fellow?’.Lyons (1977), p.343. O'Brien 1957, pp.325-6 said Blane was ‘reputed to be one of the simpler members of the party’, adding that in the debates in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons leading to the Split he ‘achieved the tour de force of defending Parnell….from an extremist Catholic and patriotic point of view…..This defence (was) exhilarating in its combination of classicism and audacity….’. Later life Blane did not stand for Parliament again. However he became active in working class politics. On 7 June 1896 he chaired an open-air meeting on the steps of the Custom House in Dublin which launched the Irish Socialist Republican Party, although he declined to join it himself.Lane (1997), p.218. The first elections for Dublin Corporation under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, held on 17 January 1899, involved a huge extension of the municipal franchise, from 7,954 to 38,769 in the constabulary borough, and opened up new possibilities for working class politics. Blane stood as a labour candidate in Trinity ward but although several labour candidates were successful in other wards, he missed election by 55 votes. The 1911 Census shows him living, unmarried, as a lodger at 3.2 Burgh Quay in Dublin, and gives his profession as tailor.To date it has not proved possible to find an obituary and it is therefore not known what he did in later life or when he died. He died on 7 February 1917 at 16 D'Olier Street, Dublin, aged 67. In the arts Alexander Blane appears as a minor character in Darran McCann's novel, 'After the Lockout' (2012).

The period of time taken by the drive to perform this process is referred to as its spin-up time, the average of which is reported by hard disks as a S.M.A.R.T. attribute. The required operational speed depends on the design of the disk drive. Typical speeds of hard disks have been 2400, 3600, 4200, 5400, 7200, 10000 and 15000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Achieving such speeds can require a significant portion of the available power budget of a computer system, and so application of power to the disks must be carefully controlled. Operational speed of optical disc drives may vary depending on type of disc and mode of operation (see Constant linear velocity). Spin-up of hard disks generally occurs at the very beginning of the computer boot process. However, most modern computers have the ability to stop a drive while the machine is already running as a means of energy conservation or noise reduction. If a machine is running and requires access to a stopped drive, then a delay is incurred while the drive is spun up. It also depends on the type of mechanism used within. A drive in the process of being spun up needs more energy input than a drive that is already spinning at operation speeds, since more effort is required for the electric motor to accelerate the platters, as opposed to maintaining their speed. Staggered spin-up In computers with multiple hard drives, a method called staggered spin-up can be employed to prevent the excessive power-consumption of spin-up, which may result in a power shortage. Power consumption during spin-up is often the highest power draw of all of the different operating states of a hard disk drive. Staggered spin-up typically starts one drive at a time, either waiting for the drive to signal it is ready or allowing a predefined period of time to pass before starting the next drive. If the power supply is able to supply sufficient current to start multiple drives at a time, that, too, is common. Staggered Spin-up (SSU) and Power-Up In Standby (PUIS) are different features that can help control spin-up of multiple drives within a computer system or a disk subsystem. Both are defined in the ATA Specifications Standards. See Serial ATA for more information. One feature, called Power-up in standby (PUIS) (also called PM2Jumper Settings Info Sheet ) is used on some Serial ATA (SATA) and Parallel ATA (sometimes called PATA or IDE) hard disk drives. PUIS requires BIOS and/or driver support to use. When power is applied to the hard disk drive, the drive will not spin-up until a PUIS Spin-Up command is issued. The computer system BIOS or RAID controller must issue the command to tell the drive(s) to spin-up before they can be accessed. PUIS can be enabled by tools such as hdparm for drives which support this feature. Another feature, called Staggered Spin-up (SSU) is used on most Serial ATA (SATA) hard disk drives. This is more common than Power-Up In Standby (PUIS) because it does not require any special commands to get the drive to spin-up. The drive electronics waits for the SATA Data Phy (Physical I/F) to activate to spin-up the drive. The computer system BIOS and/or RAID controller or RAID driver set can delay and control when the different drives will spin-up. With Western Digital hard disk drives, Pin 11 of the SATA Power Interface controls whether Staggered Spin-Up (SSU) is enabled or not. Pin 11 is also used as an activity LED connection. When the drive is initially powered on, the drive senses whether Pin 11 is left floating (high or '1' logic state) or grounded (low or '0' logic state). SSU is disabled when Pin 11 is grounded. When disabled, the drive will spin-up as soon as power is applied to it. SSU is enabled when Pin 11 is left floating or driven high (high or '1' logic state). The drive will not spin-up until the SATA Phy Interface becomes active with a connection to a SATA controller or SATA RAID controller. The SATA or SATA RAID controller can control when and how many drives can be spun- up. SSU and PUIS are features that are configured in software or firmware by the manufacturer. Information from the Fujitsu Serial ATA Interface for Mobile Hard Disk Drives whitepaper:http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/COMP/fcpa/hdd/mobile-sata- single_wp.pdf Note that staggered spin-up of disks is a feature of many multi- drive systems using SATA and RAID. It is not typically used on mobile platforms.

He went into exile after the Russian government issued a bounty for his capture. Czyński was one of the most vocal supporters of the Uprising and founded the first daily newspaper in Lublin, Kurier Lubelski. In his later life, he moved to Paris, France, where he was an advocate for Polish emigrants. Czyński served on the Polish National Committee. He authored multiple publications and edited several newspapers.  Biography  He was born on 20 January 1801 in Warsaw, Prussian partition of Poland, South Prussia province of the Kingdom of Prussia, in a Polish Jewish family of Frankists (followers of Jacob Frank - Jews who converted to Roman Catholicism). After finishing his studies at the University of Warsaw, Czyński became a lawyer and activist in Lublin, supporter of Polish Jacobins and member of Patriotic Society (Towarzystwo Patriotyczne). In 1830, he participated in the November Uprising (1830–1831) as an adjutant to the local Polish commander, Col. Wincenty Szeptycki. He became known as one of the most vocal supporters of the Uprising and the founder of the first daily newspaper in Lublin, \\"Kurier Lubelski\\". After the Uprising was defeated, the Russian government issued a bounty (1,000 chervonets) for his capture; Czyński went into exile, escaping to Prussia and eventually joining the Great Emigration in France. In Paris, France, he became one of the important activist of the Polish emigrants, where he successfully merged the Polish independence and pan-European thought (particularly Fourierist utopian socialism).

In June 2010, the band announced that they had re-entered the studio to \\"rediscover\\" and re-record the album. This nine-song version was released on August 10, 2010. 1998 recordings In 1997, the band decided to end their Rubberneck tour and began work on their follow-up album. In the beginning of 1998, the band entered Arlyn Studios and Pedernales Studio with producer Paul Leary. They recorded 15 songs in consideration for the album, initially planning for a fall 1998 release. By August, due to 'scheduling problems', the album, which now had the tentative title Feeler, was still not mixed or mastered, although there was still hope that it would be released in early 1999. During this time, the band was considering adding more songs for consideration for the album, including the new songs \\"You'll Come Down\\" and \\"Trust Game\\", as well as older songs including \\"Cut Me Out\\" and \\"Broke Down Stupid\\". Interscope Records did not approve the finished product, and rejected its release. The band went back into the studio, salvaging some of the songs recorded during the Feeler sessions, and eventually released their second full-length album Hell Below/Stars Above in the spring of 2001. The band was planning on releasing the music and were asking for suggestions for tracks to put on it on their message board before it unexpectedly went down. At this point the record company claims to have lost the master recordings for the album. Listed below are the original Feeler songs. Note that an official track list order was never finalized, and not all of the songs would have necessarily appeared on the album. Non-mastered versions have been leaked online.

However, Interscope refused to relinquish their rights to the original recordings. This led to the band deciding to re-record the songs from the album, although as Kirtland Records' Tami Thomsen stated, \\"it's not necessarily the exact same album\\", and that this version of Feeler is \\"the band's interpretation of those songs, completely new and completely from scratch.\\" The songs \\"Twitch\\", \\"Tornado\\", \\"Clarksville\\", \\"Littlefish\\", and \\"Your Day\\" were not recorded for the new album, while \\"Trust Game\\", and \\"ATF Theme\\", originally demos from around the same time, were.

With regards to human anatomy myosin and actin constitute the basic functional unit of a muscle fiber, called sarcomere, playing a role in muscle contraction. Biochemically viewed meromyosin form subunits of the actin-associated motor protein, myosin, Following proteolysis, two types of meromyosin are formed: heavy meromyosin (HMM) and light meromyosin (LMM). Light meromyosin has a long, straight portion in the “tail” region. Heavy meromyosin is a protein chain terminating in a globular head portion/cross bridge. HMM consists of two subunits, Heavy Meromyosin Subunit 1 and 2 (HMMS-1 and HMMS-2). The majority of myosin activity is concentrated in HMMS-1. HMMS-1 has an actin binding site and ATP binding site (myosin ATPase) that determines the rate of muscle contraction when muscle is stretched.

History The origins of the school can be traced to the will of Bartholomew Hickling, a leading citizen of Loughborough, who in 1683 provided an endowment for a girls' school - to match the existing grammar school for boys. The Hickling School for Girls opened in 1690 and lasted until 1876 when, with the pressures of industrialisation, it became the Hickling Boys' School. In 1917 it underwent a further change becoming a Junior Technical School, under the control of Dr Schofield's Loughborough Technical Institute (or Loughborough College as it became known, later Loughborough University). In 1921 the word \\"Technical\\" was dropped and, as Loughborough Junior College, the school became a grammar school for boys. The first boarders joined the school in 1923; there were three, one each from New Zealand, Shanghai and Puerto Rica. The first boarding house was in Victoria Street under Mr. & Mrs. Mason and nicknamed the \\"Masonic Lodge\\". By 1926 there were eighteen boarders. The numbers continued to increase and in 1933 the College purchased Field House for £4000 which is still in use today. In 1971 the boy boarders moved to Charnwood Hall, newly purchased by the Leicestershire County Council and Field House became the boarding house for girls (today both boys and girls use Field House). In 1938 came yet another change of name, this time to Loughborough College School. Dr. Schofield the principal of the Senior College retired in 1950. With his retirement came the transfer of the school to the Leicestershire Education Committee. At the same time the Junior College of Art, which was part of the Colleges Art department, was also merged with the school, bringing with it fifty girls making the school coeducational. The re-admittance of girls after a break of 75 years. The first boarder joined the school in 1952 and 10 years later Field House was purchased to house 50 boys from overseas. With these increasing numbers, new buildings were planned and in 1956 the College moved to its present site at Thorpe Hill. Even then the buildings were not large enough and the two junior years remained in the William Street huts until 1962. In 1967 Loughborough College School became a co-educational upper school taking pupils from fourteen to nineteen under the Leicestershire Plan. In 1972 Burleigh Community College was founded \\"as a base where all members of the community can be involved in their own education\\" and in 1997 Burleigh became one of the first six Specialist Sports Colleges in the country. As of September 2012 Burleigh Community College and Garendon High School merged to become Charnwood College, a through school from ages 11 to 19. Campus Burleigh had a large facilitated campus, which was spread over four main blocks; K, S, E and G, along with Sports Facilities. Before the closure of the school, Block G was mainly homed to the English, Expressive Arts, Music, PE Theory and the majority of the Science departments. Block G also contained the Main Hall which was where assemblies were held for the lower school and Year 12 (as the Burleigh Centre had become too small) and the main canteen. Block G also housed the Gymnasium, Multi-Workout Gym and a changing room that could be used by either gender PE group. Block E was another large block which was located furthest from the main road, residing nearer to the fields; this was where the ICT, Business and Humanities departments were all situated as well as the School's LRC (Learning Resource Centre / Library), the Post16 only area (The Grove Room) and a dance studio. Block S was fully dedicated to lessons such as Design, Textiles and Art and computer access rooms, it also housed a dance studio. Block K was the newest out of the four blocks and housed Languages and Mathematics. Meanwhile, Biology had a separate set of classrooms which were attached to S Block and were also counted as part of S Block. The school had a Sports Centre, Sports Hall, heated indoor swimming pool, outdoor pitches, an athletics track and all-weather pitch.  Community  As well as students using the college's facilities, most were open for adult classes as well. On site there was a nursery and an all day open day care centre for adults with physical disabilities. Some local primary/infant schools and high/secondary schools (Thorpe Acre, Boothwood, Garendon High School) used the sports coaching and swimming pool, in lessons. Results In 2007, results improved from 43% 5A*-C to 57%. After the 2009 Ofsted report, the college was put on special measures due to the following reasons: Safeguarding The school did not comply with government requirements for the safety of pupils. (A technical problem of not having updated their policy on the official database). Equal opportunities The college failed to tackle the differences in performance between boys and girls. (A technical problem of not having updated their policy on the official database). Attainment Attainment has remained consistently low over the past three years and students have made significantly less progress than they should in English and mathematics. As of October 2010, Burleigh Community College passed a follow-up inspection by Ofsted.

Active in fighting with the Welsh in 1402, he was still living in 1432, when it was discovered that he had married a daughter of Owain Glyndŵr. Family background A Scudamore received lands allotted him by the new Norman King, William the Conqueror, in the 11th century after the defeat of Harold Godwinson in 1066. He received the demesne of 'Sancta Keyna' as recorded in the Domesday Book, later called Kenchirche, which evolved into Kentchurch. The Scudamore family split into two lines over the generations and centuries, one line based at Holme Lacy and the other line based at Kentchurch. The Holme Lacy line were anti-Welsh and opponents of the Welsh rising under Owain Glyndŵr. The Kentchurch line were more sympathetic to the Welsh grievances, possibly because their geographical location, closer to Wales, enabled a greater understanding and knowledge of the people and their culture first hand. In the 13th century, through marriage they also inherited property and land within the Lordship of Abergavenny, at Troy, very near Monmouth. A Sir Alan Scudamore married the sole heiress of Troy House. A Philip Scudamore of Troy became a leader of some of Owain Glyndŵr's forces and was captured at Shrewsbury in 1409 and beheaded for his part in the rebellion. A branch of the Scudamore family later achieved prominence through agricultural developments in the seventeenth century. Officer of the Crown Sir John Scudamore held lands in Ewyas, Kentchurch and Holme Lacy and was the Deputy Squire of King Henry IV's Lordship of Brecon. In 1402 Sir John Scudamore was actively defending Carreg Cennen Castle in Carmarthenshire against Welsh forces and actually repelling successive onslaughts of Owain Glyndŵr. The siege lasted one whole year and considerable damage was inflicted on the castle - in 1416 the repair bills record that the walls had been 'destroyed and thrown down by rebels'. He is recorded as referring to Owain Glyndŵr as a 'false traytor' at this time. The castle didn't fall to the Welsh. Sir John Scudamore as constable of the castle wrote to John Fairford, the Receiver at Brecon: \\"He (Owain) lay last night at Dryslwyn with Rhys ab Gruffydd, and there I was and spoke to him upon Wales and prayed for a safe conduct under his seal, to send home my wife and her mother and their company, and he would none grant me\\". Secret marriage Sir John Scudamore married one of the daughters of Owain Glyndŵr, Alys. When this marriage, to a Welsh woman and the daughter of the rebel himself, came to the notice of King Henry VI in 1432, he summarily stripped Sir John Scudamore of the honours he held at that time as steward of the castles of Monmouth, Grosmont and White Castle. Harbourers of Glyndŵr It has been postulated that Sir John Scudamore and Alys were the harbourers of Owain Glyndŵr after his disappearance after 1412 and kept him in his final years in secret on their estates. Their ability to keep their marriage and Alys's identity secret from the wider world for over twenty years gives credence to this possibility. References *J.E. Lloyd. Owen Glendower *Chris Barber.

Because he was unwilling to repent and worship the gods of the state, he was tormented and beheaded, and his body cast into a cistern. According to one legend, at this point all the trees on the south side of the island shed tears for Isidore, and this was the origin of the mastic that is still collected regularly on the island.Victoria Finlay, Color According to tradition, his friends Ammonius and Myrope, both destined to martyrdom, would have retrieved the body and interred it properly. Later Myrope was buried beside Isidore, and on their grave miraculous recoveries were reported. There was built a chapel, and in the 5th century a church, thanking Saint Marcian. This church could be that of which a few ruins can now be admired in Chios town. St Isidore’s veneration spread in all the Mediterranean sea and he became a sailors’ protector. In 1125 his remains were brought from Chios to the Venetian Basilica of St. Mark, which contains a small chapel containing the sarchophogus. References 3\\\\.

Bruguier is credited as being the first white settler of what would become Sioux City, Iowa. Early life Bruguier was born at L'Assomption near Montreal, Canada on August 31, 1813. His parents were Elizabeth Kipp from England and French- Canadian Jean Bruguier. He studied law and began to practice as an attorney. He soon became engaged, but his fiancée died from cholera, and Bruguier then left Quebec on October 12, 1835. Fur trader Fort Pierre during the 1830s Bruguier arrived in St. Louis on November 15, 1836. He spoke French and English and became an interpreter and fur trader with the American Fur Company, working in the Missouri River area. On January 13, 1836, he arrived for his next assignment for the fur company at Fort Pierre, Dakota Territory, where he learned the Dakota language of the Sioux Indians. He befriended Yankton Sioux Chief War Eagle. Bruguier became an independent fur trader and helped to settle tensions between white settlers and Native Americans. Settlement in Iowa Theophile Bruguier Cabin, listed on the National Register of Historic Places Bruguier established a farm and trading post in 1849 at the confluence of the Big Sioux River and Missouri River, along with War Eagle and his family members. His original homestead claim extended from the Big Sioux to the Floyd River, land that became the original town of Sioux City, a French settlement, about 1852. Bruguier continued in the trade business, and was a wagon freighter and an Indian commissioner. In August 1853, he was one of 17 people to vote in the first election in Woodbury County. Personal life He married two daughters of War Eagle, Dawn and Flaming Cloud. He fathered thirteen children with them. By the late 1850s, both of his wives had died. He met a widow, Victoria Turnott, during a visit to St. Louis. They married and she returned with him to Sioux City. In the 1860s, they settled on a farm in the Salix, Iowa area. On February 18, 1896, Bruguier died from pneumonia. He was interred at the Catholic cemetery near Salix. In 1926, he was re-buried near the grave of his first two wives and War Eagle.

Foundation and early years Plaque commemorating the foundation of S.S. Lazio at Piazza della Libertà (Roma, Prati). Società Podistica Lazio, or Lazio Athletics Club, was founded on 9 January 1900 in the Prati district of Rome, making it the oldest Roman football team currently active. Wanting to encompass more than just the city of Rome, the club's nine original founding membersLuigi Bigiarelli, a non-commissioned officer in the Bersaglieri, Giacomo Bigiarelli, Odoacre Aloisi, Arturo Balestrieri, Alceste Grifoni, Giulio Lefevre, Galileo Massa, Alberto Mesones, Enrico Venier. chose to name the club Lazio, the same name as the region where the city of Rome was built. The primary colour of sky blue was chosen as a tribute to ancient Greece and pays homage to the advent of the Olympic Games. The club's first ever match came in 1902 against Virtus, a match considered, albeit unofficially, the first Rome Derby. That match was played at Piazza d'Armi, near Piazza Mazzini, and Lazio duly won 3–0 with a hat-trick from centre-forward Sante Ancherani. In 1907, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) sponsored a Roman championship called I Categoria, which Lazio won, defeating early rivals Virtus in the final. Nonetheless, they were not invited into any national championship despite their success. After this friendly football activity, Lazio officially gave birth to its football section in 1910 and joined official league competition in 1912 as soon as the FIGC began organising championships in the centre and south of Italy. Lazio reached the national final three times, but never won, losing in 1913 to Pro Vercelli, in 1914 to Casale and in 1923 to Genoa. When FIGC launched its first full national championship in 1926, Lazio started from the Prima Divisione, the forerunner of present-day Serie B. In 1927, Lazio was the only major Roman club which resisted the fascist regime's attempts to merge all the city's teams into what would become Roma the same year. This was due to Giorgio Vaccaro, a general in the fascist regime and influential in the sporting landscape. A true Lazio fan, Vaccaro defended the club's right to keep its identity and Lazio were the sole opposition to the new team. The 1930s: A unified national championship The club played in the first organised Serie A in 1929 and made their league debut on 6 October 1929, defeating Bologna 3–0 at the Rondinella ground on Via Flaminia. However, the inaugural championship was less than brilliant for Lazio, who on the final day managing a meagre 15th-placed finish. Lazio also had a considerable Brazilian influence in their early Serie A years, known as \\"Brasilazio\\". Their coach of the day, Amílcar Barbuy, was the first Brazilian to become involved with Italian football. However, this did not bring them success, as they finished eighth in 1930–31 and 13th in 1931–32. In the summer of 1932, Barbuy was replaced by an Austrian coach, Karl Stürmer, and he led the club to their first eve win in a Rome Derby, beating the giallorossi 2–1 at home. Two-straight tenth-placed finishes under Stürmer saw him replaced by compatriot Walter Alt in 1934. His arrival also coincided with those of two star players of the day, Silvio Piola and Attilio Ferraris IV. Ferraris had arrived from Roma, where he had played over 200 games, while Piola went on to become a legend of Lazio, the highest goalscorer in Serie A history and, in 1938, he also became a World Cup winner with the Italy national team. Led by the legendary striker Piola, Lazio achieved a second-place finish in 1937, their highest pre-war result. The coach that season was Hungarian József Viola. They also competed in European competition for the first time, losing in the final of the Central European Cup against Ferencváros. Lazio rounded out the decade with a memorable away derby win by 2–0 at the Campo Testaccio in 1939 and a solid fourth-placed finish in 1940. The 1930: World War II and mediocrity 1940–41 Lazio team This particular decade was dominated by Il Grande Torino, and Lazio could achieve no better than mid-table finishes. The Championship was suspended in 1943 due to the effects of World War II, and the club, now without the national hero Piola, participated in the local Campionato Romano until 1945–46 when the national championship returned, albeit in a regionalised and unofficial format. The following year, the Serie A returned to its usual format and Lazio duly finished tenth, a mediocre season, albeit ahead of Roma, who narrowly avoided relegation. The 1948–49 season was a difficult one for the biancocelesti, as players were reduced to the minimum wage and several went on strike. They finished 13th, although they recovered the following season to record an impressive fourth-placed finish, made even sweeter by the difficulties of the previous year and the miserable campaign of Roma, who once again narrowly avoided the drop to Serie B. The 1950s: The first taste of silverware Lazio made a return to Europe in 1950, playing in the Latin Cup, then considered the most prestigious continental title. The following season, the aquilotti again played in Europe, this time finishing fourth in the Mitropa Cup. These European campaigns were also complemented with successful domestic campaigns, with two further fourth-placed finishes. From 1952 to 1955, the club had to endure three poor mid-table finishes, but these were followed by two-straight seasons in which they finished third. The two major signings of this time were Swedish forward Arne Selmosson and Juventus mainstay Ermes Muccinelli. In 1958, Lazio won its first major piece of silverware, a Coppa Italia. First, the club had topped their group of four, consisting of Palermo, Napoli and rivals Roma, before eliminating Marzotto and Juventus on the road to the final, where they met Fiorentina. Led by coach Fulvio Bernardini, Lazio beat la Viola 1–0 with a goal from striker Maurilio Prini, who had ironically just left Fiorentina. The 1960s: The first seasons of Serie B The 1960s did not start brightly for Lazio. They finished their 1960–61 campaign in a record-low 18th place (last place) and were relegated alongside Napoli and Bari. Their first season in Serie B, 1961–62, ended in grave disappointment as they missed out on direct promotion back to the top flight by a one point. The following season made up for that, however, as they were promoted back to Serie A with a third-place finish. Their coach of the day was an Argentine, Juan Carlos Lorenzo, and Lazio's tight defence ensured a credible eighth-place finish in 1964 with a paltry 21 goals scored and a stingy 24 conceded. A 3–0 away win over Juventus was a highlight of the season. The club was soon hit by a financial crisis, and the presidency of the club was taken up by Umberto Lenzini, an Italian American, who made a significant impact upon the history of the club. Lazio were soon relegated back into Serie B and despite being expected to challenge for promotion, they could only manage a poor 11th place. Juan Carlos Lorenzo returned to the bench which he had left four years earlier, and with some new signings, he led Lazio to win Serie B in 1969. Stars of the side in those years included midfielder Nello Governato, who later went on to work as a manager for the club. 1970s 1973–74 Lazio team The 1970s began just as the 1960s did, with relegation following the 1970–71 season. However, promotion the following year ushered in Lazio's first truly successful period. They took to the field in the 1972–73 season with a team comprising English-born captain Giuseppe Wilson in defence, Luciano Re Cecconi and Mario Frustalupi in midfield, Renzo Garlaschelli and Giorgio Chinaglia up front, and coach Tommaso Maestrelli. With Chinaglia providing the goals and the defence giving little away, Lazio emerged as surprise challengers for the Scudetto to Milan and Juventus in 1972–73, only losing out on the final day of the season after conceding a late goal at Napoli (while Juventus left it late to secure a win at Lazio's bitter rivals Roma). It served as a prelude to a breakthrough for the 1973–74 season, when Lazio would sweep all before them to win their first league title, having led throughout the season. Unfortunately, this was not built upon, as fourth place the following year would be followed by a struggle against relegation in 1975–76 and a mid-table finish in 1977–78 (with a fifth-place finish in 1976–77 in between). The tragic deaths of Luciano Re Cecconi and scudetto- winning trainer Tommaso Maestrelli, in addition to the departure of Chinaglia in 1976, would be a triple blow for Lazio. The emergence of Bruno Giordano during this period provided some relief as he finished as the Serie A's top scorer in 1979, when Lazio finished eighth. 1980s Lazio were forcibly relegated to Serie B in 1980 due to a remarkable scandal concerning illegal bets on their own matches, along with Milan. They remained in Italy's second division for three seasons in what would mark the darkest period in Lazio's history. They would return in 1983 and manage a last-day escape from relegation the following season. The 1984–85 season would prove harrowing, with a pitiful 15 points and bottom-place finish despite the emergence of promising, though albeit unfulfilled, talent of Francesco Dell'Anno and Francesco Fonte. In 1986, Lazio was hit with a nine-point deduction (a true deathblow back in the day of the two-point win) for a betting scandal involving one player, Claudio Vinazzani. An epic struggle against relegation followed the same season in Serie B, with the club led by trainer Eugenio Fascetti only avoiding relegation to the Serie C after play-off wins over Taranto and Campobasso. This would prove a turning point in the club's history, with Lazio returning to Serie A in 1988 and, under the careful financial management of Gianmarco Calleri, the consolidation of the club's position as a solid top-flight club. 1990s The arrival of Sergio Cragnotti in 1992 changed the club's history forever as he was prepared to invest long term in new players for the club in order to make the team a competitor on the Serie A level. Cragnotti repeatedly broke transfer records in pursuit of players who were considered major stars, including Juan Sebastián Verón for £18 million from Parma, Christian Vieri for £19 million from Atlético Madrid and breaking the world transfer record, albeit only for a matter of weeks, to sign Hernán Crespo – also from Parma – for £35 million. In 1993, Lazio finished fifth in Serie A, fourth in 1994, second in 1995, third in 1996 and fourth again in 1997, then it lost the championship just by one point to Milan on the last championship's match in 1999 before, with the likes of Siniša Mihajlović, Alessandro Nesta and Pavel Nedvěd in the side, finally winning its second scudetto in 2000, as well as the Coppa Italia for a \\"double\\" with Sven- Göran Eriksson (1997–2001) as manager. In addition to the 2000 Coppa Italia win, Lazio also won the 1998 edition. Lazio also won the last ever UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1999 and reached the UEFA Cup final in 1998, but lost 0–3 against a Ronaldo-inspired Internazionale. Lazio won the Supercoppa Italiana twice and defeated 1999 Champions League winners Manchester United in 1999 to win the UEFA Super Cup. In 2000, Lazio became the first Italian football club to be quoted on the Italian Piazza Affari stock market. 2000s 2015–16 Lazio team Lazio began the decade brightly by winning the Supercoppa Italiana and finishing in third place in the league, but the departure of manager Sven- Göran Eriksson accelerated the decline of the club. With money running out, or wasted on transfer flops such as the Spaniard Gaizka Mendieta for £28 million from Valencia, Lazio missed out on the all-important qualification for the UEFA Champions League in 2001–02, finishing in a disappointing sixth-place. A financial scandal involving Cragnotti and his food products multinational Cirio forced him to leave the club in 2002, and Lazio was controlled until 2004 by caretaker financial managers and a bank pool. This forced the club to sell their star players and even the \\"symbol\\" of the club – club captain Alessandro Nesta – in quick succession. Lazio was subsequently sold to entrepreneur Claudio Lotito, who is the current majority share owner. That summer, 36-year-old former Lazio star Paolo Di Canio accepted to join the club he supported as a youth, taking a 75% pay cut. The 2005–06 season saw Lazio lose veterans such as Fernando Couto, Paolo Negro and Giuliano Giannichedda who were let go by the club, among other things, to lower its salary expenditure. The 2005–06 season under the coaching of Delio Rossi saw the club compete beyond all expectations with a team which blends remaining veterans such as Angelo Peruzzi and midfield fan favourites Fabio Liverani and Ousmane Dabo with an infusion of motivated players with lower salary demands. The policy had proven successful as the club qualified for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. On 14 July, it was announced that they had been relegated to Serie B with a seven-point penalty for their supposed involvement in match-fixing scandal. The club's appeal was successful and in a judgment released on 25 July, Lazio's penalty was reduced to an 11-point deduction in the following Serie A season (subsequently further reduced to three points) and a 30-point deduction in the previous Serie A season, resulting in the loss of their qualification to the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. Despite a later-reduced points deduction, Lazio achieved a third-place finish in the 2006–07 Serie A, just falling short of breaking the club record for games won in succession; the current squad racked up eight wins in a row, compared to the 2000 Scudetto-winning squad which set the record of nine-straight victories. In the 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons, Lazio finished in 12th and 10th place respectively, winning the Coppa Italia on 13 May 2009. Lazio started its 2009–10 season contesting the Supercoppa Italiana against Internazionale in Beijing, winning the match 2–1 through goals from Matuzalém and Tommaso Rocchi. Lazio won the 2012–13 Coppa Italia 1–0 over rivals Roma with the lone goal from Senad Lulić. Lazio won the 2018–19 Coppa Italia 2–0 over Atalanta, winning their seventh title overall.

Member species of the genus are found in warm seas from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Taxonomy The first description of the genus Aipysurus was published by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1804, accommodating his description of a new species found in Australian seas, Aipysurus laevis, the type species of the genus. The description was accompanied by an illustration of the new species. The genus is one of a small group of the viviparous sea snakes (Hydrophiinae: Hydrophiini) with Emydocephalus, also mostly restricted to the seas between Timor, New Guinea and northern Australia. The following is a list of species. *Aipysurus apraefrontalis – short-nosed sea snake *Aipysurus duboisii – Dubois' seasnake *Aipysurus eydouxii – spine-tailed sea snake *Aipysurus foliosquama – leaf-scaled sea snake *Aipysurus fuscus – dusky sea snake *Aipysurus laevis – olive sea snake *Aipysurus mosaicus *Aipysurus tenuis Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Aipysurus. A subspecies nominated in 1974 as A. laevis pooleorum was elevated in 1983 to full species status, as A. pooleorum, without explanation by the authors. The same revision (Wells and Wellington, 1983) also resurrected the species name Aipysurus jukesii (Gray, 1846), recognised as a synonym of Lacépède's Aipysurus laevis.

The SS Alcoa Puritan provided freight and passenger service between U.S. and Caribbean ports. The ship was typically staffed with 10 officers and 33 crew, and could also accommodate 8-10 passengers.  Torpedoing  On about 1 May 1942, the SS Alcoa Puritan sailed from Port of Spain, Trinidad, alone and unarmed, to Mobile, Alabama loaded with bauxite. Newly in command of the ship was Capt. Yngvar A. Krantz. (The former master of the ship, Axel B. Axelsen, had just left command after unsuccessfully urging shoreside management that the ship be armed.) Among the ten passengers were six survivors from the torpedoed Standard Oil tanker T.C. McCobb. By April 1942, the German submarine campaign was reaching its height. Records made public after the war revealed that 35 American merchant-marine ships were sunk in March; 42 were sunk in April, and May saw 52 more sent to the bottom. Just before noon on 6 May 1942, a torpedo passed astern of the Puritan - its wake sighted by one of the T.C. McCobb survivors. General alarm was sounded. A submarine surfaced a few moments later, off, and fired a warning shell that passed overhead and landed in the water ahead of the ship. Krantz ordered the ship to full speed, hoping to outrun the attacker, and steered a zig-zag course. The sub fired a few more shells that missed, but then refined its targeting and barraged the Puritan with about 70 hits over the course of about 25 minutes. The shelling laid open the ship's superstructure, perforated the funnel, broke all the windows and instrument faces, set fire to parts of the interior, and finally disabled the steering mechanism at the stern. At about 12:30 p.m., with the ship turning in circles, Krantz ordered the engines stopped and personnel to abandon ship. Soon after everyone was in the water, the submarine fired a second torpedo which struck the ship in the engine room on the port side. The Puritan started to list heavily to port and soon sank below the surface. The submarine approached the survivors, which had been gathered into lifeboats. The 34-year- old captain of the sub shouted across the water that he was sorry and that he hoped the survivors \\"make it in all right.\\" He then gave a wave, followed his crew down a hatch, submerged, and departed. In an hour or less, a United States Navy patrol aircraft - summoned by the Puritan's radio operator during the shelling - spotted the survivors, and at about 4:05 pm the United States Coast Guard cutter Boutwell arrived on the scene and rescued all the passengers and crew - some of them badly injured. Postwar research revealed the attacking sub to be U-boat , commanded by Kapitanleutnant Harro Schacht. Schacht was still in command of the U-Boat when it was bombed and sunk off Brazil on 13 January 1943, by U.S. Navy aircraft.  Crew and passengers  In addition to Capt. Yngvar A. Krantz, the crew of the ship comprised: * E.D. Albertson (Lockport, LA, Second Assistant Engineer) * N.M. Anderson (3206 General Taylor St, New Orleans, Second Mate) * G.E.

Senna (New Bedford, MA) * Genaro Videllon (Houston, TX)  Discovery  Six decades later, contractors performing deep- tow marine surveys for Shell International Exploration and Production encountered a large shipwreck about south-southeast of the entrance to the Mississippi River, in the Mississippi Canyon area. Based on survey data and historical information, marine archaeologists identified the wreck as the Puritan. C&C; Technologies was hired by Shell to conduct further investigations, which began in 2002 and continued for several years. Visual inspections by Sonsub's ROV vessel HOS Dominator found the hull mostly intact, with moderate superstructure damage. Video footage from the Puritan's resting place at 1,965 meters depth shows the \\"ALCOA PURITAN, NEW YORK\\" legend on the stern of the ship. The C&C; work formed part of a larger project concerning archaeological and biological analysis of World War II shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico, and particularly their artificial reef effect in deep water. Other vessels included in the study were the oil tankers Virginia, Halo, and Gulfpenn; the German U-boat ; the steamer Robert E. Lee; and the Anona (a steam yacht, repurposed as a freighter). All were concluded to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, for both their historical and archaeological import.

The title of the album refers to the Seven churches of Asia mentioned in the Book of Revelation. \\"The Exorcist\\" begins with producer Randy Burns' version of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, arranged and performed as it was in the 1973 horror film of the same name. About.com named the album one of \\"10 Essential Death Metal albums\\". Background According to David Konow's Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal, the album was recorded during the Spring Break of 1985 when Pinole Valley High School juniors Jeff Becerra and Larry LaLonde had ample time for studio production. Up until the release of the album, the band had practiced at manager Debbie Abono's house in Pinole, but had formed in the El Sobrante/San Pablo area, which was the location of Mike Torrao's and Mike Sus' garage band. In November of the same year, the band flew to Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the WWIII Weekend Festival in support of the Seven Churches release, playing alongside Celtic Frost, Destruction, Voivod and Nasty Savage; the concert was Possessed's first and largest arena appearance, with nearly 7,000 in attendance. Legacy and impact While Florida's Death had released more albums and is also cited as an enduring death metal progenitor, Seven Churches pre-dated the latter band's 1987 debut, Scream Bloody Gore by two years. The book Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal & Grindcore credited bassist/vocalist Jeff Becerra as initially creating the term in 1983. Seven Churches has been interchangeably described as \\"connecting the dots between thrash metal and death metal\\", being \\"monumental\\" in developing the death metal style, and as being the \\"first death metal album\\", the latter attributed to interviews with (or literature by) musicians including Kam Lee (ex-Mantas/Death, ex-Massacre), the late Ronnie James Dio (ex-Dio, ex-Black Sabbath) and Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree, Opeth). Former Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris said his introduction to metal was Possessed's Seven Churches album, a personal recommendation to him by then-guitarist Justin Broadrick. In its July 1986 review of Seven Churches, SPIN described the album as belonging to the \\"sub-mutated genre of death- metal\\" and being a \\"full-on Japanese-commuter-train-without-brakes of what this genre should sound like...bassist/vocalist Jeff Becerra regurgitates what have to be the most Stygian vocal utterances to date.\\" British extreme metal record label Earache Records stated that \\"....the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they were doing in their formative years on the Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary Seven Churches recording. Possessed arguably did more to further the cause of 'Death Metal' than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80's.\\" \\"The Exorcist\\" is covered on the Cannibal Corpse's 1993 EP Hammer Smashed Face and on Cavalera Conspiracy's 2008 album Inflikted. In August 2014, Revolver placed Seven Churches on its \\"14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own\\" list.

Plot Otello Celletti (Alberto Sordi) is an unemployed ex-soldier from a small town in Latium. Since the end of the war, he has been living with his family and father at the expense of his brother-in-law, Nando. One day he receives a letter that says he has been given a job as a carrier in the town's markets, despite his request to join the local police. Unwilling to accept the new job, he manages to meet the town's Mayor (Vittorio De Sica) and get the position he sought for. As a policeman, Otello can finally take revenge on all who had been teasing him during the post-war period when he was a jobless man, but soon starts having trouble with his duties. Incapable of directing the traffic properly at a rather busy crossing, he is moved to a peripheral area where his tasks are much easier and gets here the occasion he has always been waiting for: one day he is told by a man passing by that a car got stuck not far from there and that the car is no less than Sylva Koscina's (in the role of herself). He hurries to the spot and makes friends with the actress, managing to invite her for a coffee at a near bar, and after repairing her car (he actually only makes the situation worse and is then forced to call his little son who is a mechanic) asks Sylva to greet him on television at that night's broadcasting of the program Il Musichiere (the Italian version of Name That Tune). Although the woman is missing her driving license and car documents, he lets her go, looking forward to the moment when she will make his name in front of 18 million viewers. At Il Musichiere, that night, Sylva greets Otello publicly and dedicates to him her performance of Adriano Celentano's Il tuo bacio è come un rock, but can't help saying whom Otello is and why she knows him, revealing also how he let her go when he should have fined or even arrested her. Otello is eventually called up by the Mayor and told how grave what he has done is, and that he is at risk of losing his job if he fails to fulfill his duties again: as a policeman, in fact, he must act according to law and make no distinctions. Some time after, Otello is in the workplace when a car passes by exceeding the 50 km/h speed limit in the area by 15 km/h. Driving the car is no less than the Mayor himself. Remembering what he had been told the day before and believing he is merely being tested by the Mayor, he gives him a speeding ticket and, as the Mayor drives away, follows him. He thus finds out the Mayor has a secret love story, despite being married. However, when he inspects the house where he thinks he will catch the man he is told by a woman (the Mayor's secret partner) that he is wrong and that there is no Mayor in there. The day after, despite being advised by his superiors not to proceed and fine the Mayor, he does so, confident of being in the right, revealing also about the possible skeletons in the Mayor's closet. The Mayor decides therefore to punish Otello, who soon gets fired, and chooses to go on trial rather than paying the fine. The town is, however, close to elections, and the disappointed policeman, unemployed again, is made the candidate of the Monarchist National Party, which opposes the current Mayor and uses Otello's case as evidence that the current government does not operate justly. Certain to have the whip hand, he threatens the Mayor, declaring he will cause his government to fall and get elected himself, to which the Mayor replies by showing Otello secret information about him that he and his party have collected. The information concerns his family, specifically his sister, who was thought to be a masseuse living in Milan and is instead a prostitute, his marriage, which is not a legal one for his wife's ex-husband is still alive, and his father, who shot the King during the war, an action that would be considered an outrage by the monarchists. Fearing for the consequences this information might cause if revealed to the public, Otello decides to finally give up, and on the next day's trial he admits, pretending, that he was wrong in fining the Mayor, a mistake that was caused by a broken Odometer, and that such a man as the Mayor himself can't but be always right. The final scene goes to show how common people are unable to compete with the powerful, and must, in the end, submit.

History The SMSS was developed for the US Army as transport and logistics support by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control division. The SMSS Block 0 could travel up to and carry up to in gear. Unloaded, it weighed up to and could potentially be parachuted from an aircraft. It can be driven by an operator or remotely operated, or operate in supervised autonomy. Currently the SMSS is unarmed, but there are plans to arm it with either RPG or small missile systems. The SMSS Block 1 went to Afghanistan for a military utility assessment in late 2011. The Block 1 version has a lighter frame, infrared driving lights, a smaller and more efficient sensor package, and insulated exhaust and hydraulics that make them quieter in the field.Gizmag SMSS It is heavier, at unloaded, but can carry a larger, payload, and has a operating range.Lockheed SMSS pdf - Lockheed The SMSS can operate autonomously, be programmed to \\"follow the leader,\\" be tele- operated, or controlled manually by getting on the vehicle and using a joystick to steer. The vehicle has a litter-carrying kit for casualty evacuation.Robotic Mule Vendors Seek Opportunities Outside Military - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, July 2013 Four vehicles were deployed to Afghanistan. They were used to resupply small combat outposts and strongpoints, and construction projects on its larger forward operating base. One unit used the SMSS to carry a total of of supplies over the course of two days to a small combat outpost two kilometers away, regularly carrying 2,000-pound loads. One time, soldiers overloaded one vehicle up with filled sandbags, which was estimated to weigh (exceeding Lockheed’s recommended carrying weight of 1,200 pounds), and successfully drove it up a 30-degree slope. While initially planned as a squad-level asset, it was used more at the platoon level. From fielding experiences, Lockheed planned improvements to the system, considering adding another alternator to increase its power output since one group of soldiers in Afghanistan had been trying to use it as a mobile operations center by loading it up with generators and batteries while out on missions. Lockheed is also considering adding a manipulator arm so it can load and unload cargo itself.SMSS in Afghanistan - Unmanned Systems Technology.com, May 24, 2012 The deployment to Afghanistan for operational evaluations lasted from January to May 2012. In February 2013, the SMSS performed a successful demonstration while being controlled by satellite from its operator. The vehicle had an adjustable-height mast with a Gyrocam 9M, acquiring on-the-move, high-resolution electro-optical and thermal video. Movement and sensor functions were controlled from a remote station via tele- operation. In a simulated mission, the operator provided a pre-planned route and SMSS autonomy allowed navigation with minimal operator intervention, while other autonomous functions, such as follow-me, go-to-point and retro-traverse, were also demonstrated. The demonstration proved that the combination of autonomy, vehicle mobility, surveillance sensors, and satellite communications can provide a means of battlefield situational awareness without human intervention.Lockheed Martin’s SMSS Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle Operates Via Satellite Control - Lockheed press release, February 19, 2013 From 7-10 October 2013, the SMSS took part in testing, along with other systems, at Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the U.S. Army's Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) program. The program objective is to find an unmanned robotic platform to transport soldier equipment and charge batteries for their electronic gear. Requirements for the vehicle are to carry of gear, equal to the amount a nine-man infantry squad would need on a 72-hour mission. Cubic volume is seen as more of a problem for load-carrying unmanned vehicles, as their center of gravity changes when more gear has to be stacked. It has to travel for eight-hour marches and speed up in bursts of up to for 200 meters. The proposed S-MET vehicle needs to traverse forward and backward on slopes of up to 30 percent and descending on slopes of 60 percent. Moving on rough terrain was a challenge for the four SMSS vehicles deployed to Afghanistan in 2012; they could not discern between soldiers and obstacles like trees, so they mostly traveled on roads instead of complex terrain.UGV models face off over firepower, load carrying - Armytimes.com, 12 October 2013 The SMSS was not selected to continue S-MET trials.Four companies advance to build Army’s equipment transport ground robot - Defensenews.com, 14 December 2017 On 7 August 2014, the SMSS was used in an exercise at Fort Benning to combine the abilities of both an unmanned ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle. It involved the SMSS and an unmanned K-MAX helicopter, both Lockheed Martin systems, operating in a simulated area deemed too risky for human presence. The K-MAX autonomously transported the SMSS by sling load into the area and set it down over an intended point, releasing it upon command from a remote operator. The K-MAX returned to base, then the SMSS used autonomous operation and limited tele-operation from a remote site to move around the area. Once deployed, the vehicle used a mast-mounted Gyrocam electro-optical sensor and satellite communications (SATCOM) terminal with a data-link for area surveillance. The exercise was intended to demonstrate that large UAVs and UGVs could operate alongside each other by themselves and beyond line-of-sight to perform missions to keep personnel out of harm's way.US Army, Lockheed Martin Test Collaborative Robotics at Ft Benning - Defense-Update.com, 18 August 2014 ReferencesExternal links *Lockheed Martin Develops Supervised Autonomy For Unmanned Ground Vehicles *How Stuff Works *SMSS - Lockheed.com Category:Unmanned ground vehicles Category:Lockheed Martin ","title":"Squad Mission Support System"},{"id":"13347915","text":"Tuomas Kantelinen (born 22 September 1969 in Kankaanpää) is a Finnish composer.

A member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilkenny City from 1886 to 1892 and Treasurer of the Irish National League and the Irish Land League of Great Britain. In the Split in the Irish Parliamentary Party over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, he began as a supporter of Parnell but changed allegiance to the Anti-Parnellite majority in May 1891.  Early life  Quinn had a humble background. He was the son of Matthew Quinn of Longford, Co. Longford. He was educated at Longford and Mullingar, Co. Westmeath. At an early age he went to London, where he lived for the rest of his life. He learned the building trade as a journeyman carpenter, eventually creating a large building business of his own, and winning government contracts. He was one of the pioneers of the building of flats. In 1863 he married Mary, daughter of Michael Canlan, and they had four children.  Political career  He stood as a Home Rule candidate for County Leitrim in 1880, but came 170 votes short of winning a seat. He remained active in the Nationalist cause; as of 1883 he was Treasurer of the National League and Land League of Great Britain.Letter by ‘Nemo’ in The Times, 10 July 1888. This letter formed part of The Times’ \\"Parnellism and Crime\\" campaign against Parnell and his party. Presumably most of what was stated in the letter was false, but there is no reason to doubt the statement that Quinn was the League’s Treasurer. In August 1885 he was adopted as a Nationalist candidate for County Longford, and at a convention in October 1885 it was decided that he would fight the South seat. He had to withdraw before being formally nominated because of an indirect connection with a government contract,The Times, 17 July 1886 but in the following July 1886 general election, he was returned unopposed for Kilkenny City. Quinn was a particular target of the \\"Parnellism and Crime\\" campaign by The Times newspaper against Parnell and his party.Moody (1968) appears to be the most up-to-date and authoritative overview of this episode, although he does not refer specifically to Thomas Quinn. Whereas the main accusation against Parnell was simply that according to a corrupt journalist Richard Pigott he had privately expressed support for the Phoenix Park Murders, Quinn was effectively accused in an anonymous letter published on 13 June 1887 of being an accessory to the murders themselves. He was effectively exonerated, along with his co-accused, by the collapse of The Times’ case before the Parnell Commission in February 1889. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split over the question of Parnell's leadership in December 1890, Quinn supported Parnell. However he disagreed with Parnell over the latter's treatment of the disputed \\"Paris funds\\"The Times, 4 May 1891 and in May 1891 he applied for the Whip of the Anti-Parnellite Parliamentary Party chaired by Justin McCarthy. The Anti-Parnellites were seriously divided between the factions led on the one hand by Timothy Healy, and on the other by John Dillon and William O'Brien; between them Quinn was a neutral.The Times, 16 April 1892 In February 1892 he saw off an attempt by a creditor to have him committed to prison, when the judge at Westminster County Court threw out the case on the ground of Parliamentary privilege. Quinn retired from Parliament at the general election of July 1892 due to ill-health.The Times, 4 November 1897 He died at his home in Kensington on 3 November 1897, having never recovered from a severe chill contracted when attending a Gaelic athletic sports event four months previously.

He was convicted of the murder of John Innes Nisbet, which took place on a train travelling between Newcastle railway station and Alnmouth railway station, on 18 March 1910. Nisbet had been carrying a bag containing the wages for a colliery. His body was discovered in a train compartment; he had died of gunshot wounds and his bag had been stolen. On 6 July Dickman was convicted of the murder of Nisbet, and he was hanged in Newcastle Prison on 10 August, the last man to be hanged in a Newcastle jail. There was some doubt over the conviction, as it appeared to some people to rest on inconclusive identification evidence. There was a campaign for him to be reprieved, with leaflets distributed in stations. The writer C H Norman was among those who were convinced of John Dickman's innocence. It has also been claimed that Dickman's defence lawyer was incompetent. The case is not widely remembered today. However it did figure in the 1976 BBC television series Second Verdict, 2018 BBC television series Murder, Mystery and My Family and a 2008 television programme Nightwatch. The latter programme suggested that two witnesses who said they saw Dickman and Nisbet entering the same compartment may even have been the real killers. Two episodes of the radio show \\"The Black Museum\\" hosted by Orson Welles were based on Dickman's case. One, \\"The Tan Shoes\\" featured Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson.

History Aerial view of the campus looking from the southwest. Main building Meetinghouse on campus Olney Friends School has enjoyed over 150 years of success in the field of educating young men and women. The school was founded in 1837 by the Ohio Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). As early as 1814, this group of newly settled Ohio Quakers began plans for a boarding school for both boys and girls, which was to be modeled on Quaker boarding schools in Philadelphia. Finally, in 1835, the building of the school commenced and was opened for students two years later. This early school, which was simply known as the Friends Boarding School, was located at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, northeast of its current location. The name \\"Olney\\" was informally adopted from a poem entitled \\"Olney Green,\\" written by Louis Taber, a visiting minister from Vermont and teacher at the school in the 1840s. In 1854 there was a division in Ohio Yearly Meeting, the principal organizing body of Ohio Quaker Meeting groups, over doctrinal differences. The division occurred between two groups that had differing visions for the future of Ohio Yearly Meeting. Eventually the Ohio Supreme Court awarded the original school building to the \\"Gurney\\" group of Quakers in 1874. The other group, known as the \\"Wilburite\\" Quakers built a new school building at the present Barnesville location in 1876. In March 1910, Olney's main building was gutted by a fire that started in its belfry burned to the ground, leaving only the outer brick walls and the front porch. Although the building had housed the classrooms, the student living quarters and the dining area, the class of 1910 remained through the year to graduate on time thanks to local families who opened their homes. The main building was rebuilt and separate boys and girls dormitories were added. Even before the buildings were completed, the students moved back into their new school in November, 1910. The gymnasium was added in 1938; a new girls dormitory was built in 1967. While Olney Friends School originally only served students from Quaker families, by the 1960s students from a variety of religious, cultural, and geographic backgrounds began attending the school. In 1978 the school's official name was changed to Olney Friends School. In 1998 Ohio Yearly Meeting decided to end its governance of the school due to low enrollment and increasing financial burden. A group of individuals, mostly Olney Friends School alumni concerned for the continuance of the school, formed a new corporation: Friends of Olney, Inc. After much deliberation Ohio Yearly Meeting agreed to turn over the management of the school to this group and negotiated a lease for the use of the school property, about 350 acres, including the farm. When the transition was completed a board of trustees began operating the institution as an independent Quaker school no longer under the care of a Friends Meeting. The former name, Olney Friends School Inc., was legally transferred and continues to provide a sense of continuity based on the school's Quaker roots. In late June 2004 an agreement for the purchase of the main campus property from Ohio Yearly Meeting was successfully negotiated, while the farm land continuing to be leased. Today, Olney Friends School's 35-40 students come from diverse international, religious, social and economic backgrounds. In the 21st century, Olney Friends School is chartered by the Ohio State Department of Education and is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Central States. Olney Friends School also holds memberships in the Ohio Association of Independent Schools, Midwest Boarding Schools, the School Scholarship Service, Friends Council on Education, the Association of Boarding Schools, and the National Association of Independent Schools. In 2015 the school received its USDA Certificate, making it the U.S.'s first USDA Certified Organic high school.

The story expands to involve a hit man, a call girl and the Hollywood producer. The film itself makes several mentions of the Dogme 95 style of filmmaking, and has been described as a \\"Dogme film-within-a-film.\\" Reception The film was not a financial success and received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert noted this and pointed out the complex nature of the film: > Many critics have agreed that Hotel is not successful, but I would ask: Not > successful at what? Before you conclude that a movie doesn't work, you have > to determine what it intends to do. This is not a horror movie, a behind- > the-scenes movie, a sexual intrigue or a travelogue, but all four at once, > elbowing one another for screen time.

He later became a manager, taking charge of Shrewsbury Town and Weymouth. Playing career Born in Liverpool, Davies began his football career when he joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1957 at the age of 17. His first season at the club was spent in the reserves and Davies became disillusioned with the coaching process at the club, claiming \\"I couldn't see myself learning anything because I had no one to learn from\\". However, Davies later met former Wolves goalkeeper Bert Williams in his shop and Williams offered to help train Davies in his spare time, the pair having training sessions at Wolves' Castlecroft training ground. He had to wait five years before making his debut on 27 January 1962 in an FA Cup tie against rivals West Brom. He managed 12 appearances during this season, and made the position his own in the 1962–63 campaign, replacing Malcolm Finlayson. He faced competition throughout his time at Molineux, but was the club's main goalkeeper during the mid 1960s as they suffered relegation from the top flight, only to win promotion back in 1966–67. He also played for the Wolves team which, playing as the Los Angeles Wolves, won the 1967 United Soccer Association championship. In 1968, the goalkeeper left Wolves for Second Division side Cardiff City for a fee of £10,000. He played over 100 games in total for the Bluebirds, winning the Welsh Cup on three occasions, before moving on to Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic (soon to be renamed AFC Bournemouth) two years later. He won another promotion here as the club went up to the (old) Third Division in 1970–71. Coaching career Upon retiring from playing, he joined his former Bournemouth manager John Bond as a coach at Norwich City during the 1970s. Bond had been instrumental in Davies' move into coaching having encouraged him to get his coaching badges during a lengthy injury spell during their time at Bournemouth together. He was a coach under Alan Ball at Blackpool in the 1980–81 season.Blackpool F.C.'s official Twitter account, 3 September 2020 He later had two spells on the coaching staff at Swansea City during the 1980s. He joined up again with John Bond in the early 1990s at Shrewsbury Town and stepped in as caretaker manager after Bond's resignation in May 1993. His first season as manager of Shrewsbury was a success as he guided the club to the Division Three championship, and he was officially appointed on a full- time basis in January 1994. He took the club to Wembley for the first time in their history in April 1996 when they reached the final of the Football League Trophy, only to lose 2–1 to Rotherham United. Davies steered the club clear of the drop in the third tier for two seasons before relegation struck in 1996–97, which cost him his job at the end of a season where the club had looked set for mid-table security for most of the campaign before a late slump in form. He made a quick return to management with non-league Weymouth, managing the Dorset club for two seasons, winning promotion to the Southern Premier League in his first season there. Death Davies, who latterly lived at Telford, Shropshire, died on 2 September 2020 aged 81, eighteen months after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.

He practiced medicine in several French hospitals and asylums during his career, including the Asylum of Ville-Evrard and the hospital of Sainte- Anne. He also worked as a physician at the Asylum of Marsens in Switzerland. Sérieux is best known for research of psychoses and delusional thought processes, and his collaborative work with Joseph Capgras (1873–1950). With Capgras, he described a type of non-schizophrenic, paranoid psychosis called délire d’interprétation, which is defined as a \\"chronic interpretive psychosis\\". Sérieux was also instrumental in introducing the theories of German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) into French psychiatry. With his one-time mentor Valentin Magnan (1835–1916), he co-authored the book Le délire chronique a evolution systématique (1892), and in 1909 with Capgras, he published a treatise called Les folies raisonnantes. Sérieux traveled widely throughout Europe, and created an extensive report on the state and conditions of psychiatric treatment in French, German, Swiss and Belgian mental asylums.

S. Cardone. Set on a small island near the Atlantic coast, the plot concerns two couples who upon visiting the island get trapped there due to an oncoming hurricane. As one of the women knows from her plaguing nightmares that the island is dangerous, over the next three days they begin to be killed by something unseen. The film is notable for gaining notoriety and being classified in the United Kingdom as a \\"video nasty\\" in the 1980s. The film is presented in non-chronological order, leaving it unclear as to which sequence is the actual climax, and three mutually-exclusive interpretations of the films' events are offered, with narrative evidence in favor of each. Plot Kay is an abstract visual artist who has been plagued since childhood by a series of disturbing dreams. The intensity and frequency of the dreams have fluctuated over the course of her life, as has their content; some of her dreams are simply of glimpses of desolate locations that leave her feeling dread upon awakening, while others feature the gruesome deaths of her friends and loved ones at the hands of a supernatural force. Recently, her dreams have become more frequent and disturbing than ever, resulting in a shift in the quality of her work. Afraid that the dreams are aggravated by stress and depression, and fearful that her newfound success may be slipping away, Kay's family and friends plan a vacation for her to a small island off the coast of Georgia. Accompanying Kay are her husband David; Kay's brother Eric, who introduced her to David; and Eric's wife Brooke. As the couples' plane prepares to land, their pilot, Marsh, informs them that he's just received notification that an Atlantic hurricane has shifted course towards the island. Marsh hurriedly drops the couple off, telling them that he has to leave the island before he's stranded there. The couples discover that, against expectations, the island is deserted, and populated largely by derelict buildings and the ruins of a once-thriving resort town. Kay informs the rest of the quartet that the island is the place she has been dreaming about since childhood, and that they are all in danger if they stay. Unable to leave due to the hurricane, the others try to assuage her fears. The following evening, David is murdered by an unseen assailant, and Kay dreams of waking up next to his severed head. That day, she finds David's decapitated body hanging in an abandoned playhouse on the island. Eric believes that Marsh never left the island and brought the couples there to kill them, a supposition that is granted some support when Marsh is later seen on the island. Kay believes that the island has allowed her dreams to cross over into reality, and that the creature from her nightmares is responsible—a theory supported by the fact that the deaths only occur when Kay is asleep. Additionally, it becomes apparent that Kay herself may be the killer, murdering in the throes of a somnambulistic trance out of repressed resentment towards her loved ones. As night falls, Eric goes to retrieve flares from a boathouse, and is murdered on the beach before being dragged into the ocean. Later, Brooke is attacked in the boathouse and impaled with a pitchfork. After finding their bodies on the beach, Kay barricades herself in the beach house and struggles to stay awake, incessantly drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes to remain stimulated. In the middle of the night, Marsh attempts to gain entry into the house. Kay shoots him with a flare gun which kills him and sets the house on fire. In the chaos, Kay discovers a flaming, skeletal creature waiting for her at the front door. As the grotesque creature approaches her, Kay—as a child—is woken up on Christmas morning by her parents. Kay tells them that she had a nightmare and describes the events of the film; it is unclear whether the scene is a flashback or if the film itself was merely a nightmare. After telling her parents about the dream, Kay's father presents her with a black cat, and Eric enters the room. Kay looks at the cat and becomes visibly frightened. CastAnalysis The Slayer has received critical attention from film scholars and horror film enthusiasts due to its ambiguous sensibility, with part of its narrative being told in a non-chronological order, allowing for multiple mutually-exclusive interpretations supported by various elements of the script.Kerswell et al. 2017 (0:12:07) The core events of the film which occur on the island have been noted by critics for their dubious nature, as they can alternately be interpreted in three ways: The events which take place are entirely part of a dream or premonition; a monstrous creature in fact exists on the island and is responsible for each of the murders; or the characters of Kay or Marsh are responsible for the killings.Kerswell et al. 2017 (0:12:59) However, the script does not resolve this fundamental issue, instead referring back to itself. Additionally, each of the characters in the film foreshadow their own deaths in dialogue which occurs in the film's first act.Kerswell et al. 2017 (0:11:58) Production In 1981, writer-director J.S. Cardone was working at a liquor store in Los Angeles while attempting to break into the film business, and pitched the idea for The Slayer to producer William R. Ewing. The International Picture Company, an independent film studio based in Atlanta, agreed to help produce the project on a budget of approximately $750,000. As a result of the studio's basis in Georgia, the crew scouted areas in the state to shoot the film, settling in Tybee Island, east of Savannah, Georgia. Upon arriving at the island—which at that time was largely uninhabited and dilapidated—Cardone recalled it fit perfectly with the vision he had had for the film while writing the script. Filming took place in the winter of 1982 on Tybee Island with additional photography in Savannah. Release After the film's production company, The International Picture Show Company, went bankrupt, the film was acquired for distribution by 21st Century Film Corporation. It was subsequently given a brief theatrical release in October 1982, showing in New York City in an edited rough cut that had not been color-corrected. This print of the film would later be used for VHS releases in the mid-1980s.  Critical reception  Allmovie wrote \\"The Slayer boasts some effectively eerie atmosphere and a dark, downbeat attitude. Unfortunately, sluggish pacing eliminates the tension that might have been established between the minimal cast and the sinister deserted-island setting.\\" Gordon Bowker of Variety deemed The Slayer a \\"boring horror film for hit-and-run bookings.\\" In his 1989 video guide The Horror Film: A Guide to More Than 700 Films on Videocassette, James Mulay notes: \\"Director J.S. Cardone manages to present this overly familiar material with considerable flair, considering his low budget, and the film does have a genuinely surreal, nightmarish quality.\\" Film historian Adam Rockoff praised the film's special effects, and called it a \\"straightforward, sophisticated, and unexpectedly well-acted film.\\" Film historian John Wiley Martin called the film \\"a pretty modest, sub-Repulsion exercise in escalating alienation from the point of view of a troubled young woman.\\" Scholars David Kerekes and David Slater praised the film's opening sequence and noted elements of German Expressionism present in the film, but added that the latter portion of the film paled in comparison to its opening act. Home media The Slayer was released in the United States on double feature video format by Continental Video alongside another feature: Scalps. It was cut by five minutes or so, in order to make room for the second feature, but all the gruesome scenes and violence are intact.Ziemba, Joseph A. (September 1, 2005). In the United Kingdom, the film was initially released uncut on pre-cert VHS format in 1983. However, it was subsequently seized and banned by the BBFC and placed on the infamous \\"video nasty\\" list in October 1983 in jurisdiction of the then upcoming Video Recordings Act 1984, which stated that all video content must carry a classification for home video releases. Films which contained extreme or excessive violence, gore or sex had to be edited to fit the 18 classification or banned outright. The Slayer was removed from the list in April 1985. The film received a 14-second cut version by the BBFC when it was picked up by the now defunct Vipco (Video Instant Picture Company) for VHS distribution and released on March 1, 1992. This VHS would later become a collectible after going out of print, with an average resale price of $75 in 1996. On August 13, 2001, Vipco released the film complete and uncut on both VHS and DVD, from their \\"Vaults of Horror\\" collection. On October 13, 2003, Vipco again released the same uncut version on DVD-only format for their \\"Vipco's Screamtime Collection\\" which contained newly commissioned artwork that differed from all previous releases. Although the company was popular, it was also criticized for stating that their DVD releases were digitally remastered, when in fact they were simply VHS transfer prints, which unfortunately led The Slayer to remain in its cropped 4:3 aspect ratio. Vipco's company dissolved in 2007 and distribution rights were later held by the defunct Cornerstone Media for a brief time under their subsidiary Beyond Terror, releasing the film on DVD on February 15, 2010. However, Cornerstone Media made the film available only with updated artwork; the disc itself is from Vipco's Screamtime Collection release, which is something the company did with all titles they picked up from Vipco. The inserted discs were perhaps Vipco's unsold or refurbished copies. Arrow Films released the film on dual format Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom on August 21, 2017, and in the United States on August 29, 2017. The set contains a 4K transfer of the film and is available for the first time in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and contains English Mono uncompressed PCM audio and English subtitles for hard-of-hearing. It includes several interviews with cast and crew members as well as three audio commentaries.

It was the first NYCHA development to be completely demolished.  Former development  Prospect Plaza Houses had four buildings, 12 and 15 stories tall with 368 apartments and approximately 1,171 residents. It was completed on June 30, 1974.  Demolition  In 1999, NYCHA applied for a $21.4 million HOPE VI grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to rebuild the complex after noting its deterioration. The proposed plan contained approximately 670 units, 323 of which are public housing rental units, 273 are non-public housing rental units and 37 are two-family homeowner units. The total project was anticipated to cost over $255 million. Developer Michaels Development Company was hired in 2003 and the first building was torn down in 2005 and the New York City Housing Authority plans to demolish the other buildings and build new apartments as this would be cheaper than renovating the existing units. In 2007, NYCHA terminated its agreement with Michaels. Michaels sued the agency for $5.6 million for breach of contract. Against federal guidelines, New York City amended its 2010 annual plan with HUD, after the public hearing. Instead of adding one building, it would tear down the entire development and replace it with 80 public housing rental units and add affordable housing. In the summer of 2014, the other three buildings were torn down and new buildings are currently being built. Construction has started on the buildings on Prospect Place.

Many of these residents were instead given vouchers to alternative Section 8 housing. Many former residents have expressed dissatisfaction with what they claim was an unfair deal to remove them in order for the city to turn the buildings into condominiums and bring in more money.

The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2005.The Studio Building, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaThe Studio Building, National Register of Historic Places Designated by the City of Toronto under the Ontario Heritage Act by By- law 115-200325 Severn Street, City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties Situated at 25 Severn Street, it is located in the Rosedale ravine immediately east of the above-ground Ellis portal that brings subway trains into and out of the north end of the Bloor-Yonge subway station. The site and positioning takes advantage of the northern exposure that illuminates the artist's canvas with very even, neutral light. History Financed by Lawren Harris, heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune, and Dr James MacCallum, the Studio building was conceived a nonprofit facility, where the rents were pegged at $22 per month, a level that would cover only expenses. Harris and MacCallum intended the building to be a living, meeting, socializing and, most importantly, a working facility for artists to foster and promote a uniquely Canadian art movement based largely on portraying the landscape of the country. The building, located at 25 Severn street in Toronto, was designed by Arts and Crafts architect Eden Smith. Harris, overseeing construction of the building, was too busy to concentrate on his own artistic endeavours and loaned his own studio space, over the Commerce Bank branch at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor streets, to a newly arrived Montrealer, A.Y. Jackson. Construction was completed in January 1914. Tom Thomson was another of the first residents of the building. The epitome of the starving artist, he had been persuaded to quit the Grip Ltd art design agency, take up residence in the Studio Building, and devote his energies, full-time, to his art. MacCallum financially supported Thomson, who initially shared studio 1 with A. Y. Jackson, for the first twelve months. When Jackson left to work for the government documenting Canadians fighting World War I and Harris departed to be a gunnery instructor, Thomson moved in to share a studio with Franklin Carmichael. When Carmichael married and left a few months later Thomson, still commercially unsuccessful (he would never, in his lifetime, earn enough to make a living from painting alone) could not afford the $22 monthly studio rental fee. There was another factor: Thomson had never really enjoyed working in the city, felt that a studio was \\"pretentious,\\" and wanted to work in an environment closer to his beloved wilderness settings. His obvious talent was a great inspiration to the other, older artists, and they were unwilling to see their friend move away. MacCallum spent $176 (a considerable sum in those days) to refurbish a workmen's shed on the east side of the building; it was there, for $1 a month, that Thomson spent his last winters. (Thomson would spend the summers in Algonquin Park as a ranger and fire-fighter and then decamp, during the winter, to Toronto and the Studio Building to work oil sketches made during the summer and fall into full canvases.) A.Y. Jackson at work in the building On his return from World War I, Jackson again took up residence, but this time on the top floor, in Studio 6. He removed Thomson's easel, made by Thomson's own hand, from the shed and used it for all the subsequent pictures he produced in the Studio Building. Shortly after he returned from wintering on Georgian Bay, he learned that in his absence he had been included in an informal group of Studio Building artists, exhibiting for the first time, called the Group of Seven. The resulting show had mixed results, but the Group was able to capitalize on the criticism they received; they were seen as vanguards of a new art style that was uniquely Canadian and challenging dated tastes. By 1940 Harris was living in Vancouver, and his ties to the Studio Building, except emotional, were for all intents and purposes severed. In 1948 he sold the Studio Building to lawyer-turned-artist Gordon MacNamara and a partner for $20,000. The building was once nestled in a serene valley, but trains now rattle along the nearby subway line The Studio Building was well beyond its heyday. A.Y. Jackson, who by now was the only remaining member of the original tenants and even of the Group of Seven still living in the building, said in his autobiography \\"A Painter's Country\\", that MacNamara slipped notes under the door of his studio complaining about the noise of his hammering while stretching canvases - MacNamara was a watercolourist working on paper - and mandating that Jackson would have to do his prep work in the basement. He left other notes, admonishing Jackson for walking about in his studio, insisting that he wear felt-soled shoes to muffle the noise. An unhappy Jackson left the building in 1955 with Lawren Harris mourning, in a letter from Vancouver: > Your moving from the Studio Building marks the end of an era, the one era of > creative art that has the greatest significance for Canada... You were the > real force and inspiration that led all of us into a modern conception that > suited this country, and the last to leave the home base of operations. It was only after lengthy negotiations with MacNamara that art collector Robert McMichael, in 1962, was able to purchase Tom Thomson's old shack and have it removed for exhibit at the McMichael gallery in Kleinberg, northwest of the city. MacNamara was concerned that locals, who were well aware of the shed's historic significance, might think him too eager to dispose of it. The terms, when finalized, stipulated that McMichael would pay MacNamara $800 and landscape the resulting vacant spot so as to remove any trace of the shed's presence. MacNamara himself faced challenges near the end of his long life when the City of Toronto approved a proposal by Canadian Tire in 2003 to construct 18- and 25-storey condominium towers on the western side of the ravine. As the condominium buildings threatened to destroy the quality of light that artist tenants had enjoyed for nine decades, MacNamara appealed the approval to the Ontario Municipal Board. MacNamara eventually withdrew his appeals, and the condominium approvals came into full force and effect.Nasmith, Catherine. \\"Studio Building-Post Script\\". Built Heritage News. Issue no. 39. 2004-09-03. Retrieved 2008-07-01. As a condition of his withdrawal, he received a $75,000 settlement from Canadian Tire. Backed by endorsements from the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, MacNamara applied for — and won — National Historic Site status for the building. Gordon MacNamara died in 2006, leaving the future of the building in some question. His son has expressed interest in selling the building, appraised for $1.37 million. While its designation as an historic site protects only the outside of the building, many hope that a new owner will do as much as possible to protect its legacy as a Canadian art treasure.

Narrow strips of land separate it from Richardson Bay (to the northwest) and Raccoon Strait. The lagoon is owned and maintained by the Belvedere Lagoon Property Owners' Association. The lagoon is not accessible by boat from San Francisco Bay, and no public access is provided. Until somewhat late in the 20th century houseboats were present in Belvedere Lagoon.Russell Conder. 1992 There used to be a natural passage between the lagoon and the San Francisco Bay through the southern spit. The passage was spanned by a drawbridge. From the late 19th century, the drawbridge would be raised twice a year, once in the Spring to allow pleasure boats of the Corinthian Yacht Club to exit the lagoon, where the boats wintered, and go to their Summer moorings, and once in the Fall, to allow the boats to return. This raising of the drawbridge signaled the beginning of the pleasure boat season. In 1917, that informal celebration morphed into a more formal and elaborate parade of boats that has now evolved into the Opening Day on the Bay involving the 104 clubs of the Pacific Inter-Club Yacht Association. Belvedere Lagoon was partially filled after World War II to provide building sites for tract houses and to improve access to Belvedere Island. It was also once the site of a 9-hole golf course.

Early years Theodorsen was born at Sandefjord in Vestfold, Norway to parents Ole Christian Theodorsen, a chief engineer in the Norwegian merchant marine, and his wife Andrea Larsen. He was the oldest of six children. When Theodore’s father took the examinations for a merchant marine engineer's license, he was the only applicant who correctly answered a particularly difficult question. To his father’s surprise his then 12-year-old son was also able to solve the problem. At age 16, after finishing compulsory schooling, Theodorsen attended gymnasium in the nearby town of Larvik. Theodorsen's grades were so outstanding that he was admitted to the leading engineering university in Norway, the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. Emigration In 1922 Theodorsen graduated with a master's degree in mechanical engineering and was offered a position at the university as an instructor. That year one of his students was Lars Onsager, who became a lifelong friend and later went on to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Theodorsen, like many Norwegian engineers, decided after some years as an instructor in Norway to emigrate. There were few jobs for engineers in Norway at the time. His wife's family knew a retired Norwegian sea captain who lived in Baltimore, so that became their American destination. They arrived in the United States on board the on August 25, 1924.Theodor Theodorsen. Trondhjem, Norway (The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc.) Johns Hopkins University Because there were few jobs in Baltimore, Theodorsen took a job working the third shift as an oiler at the Sparrows Point electrical generating plant 20 miles from Baltimore. Then Johns Hopkins University advertised for an instructor in mechanical engineering and he obtained the position. He taught at Johns Hopkins for five years. In 1928, Onsager, taught at Johns Hopkins for one semester. It was at that time that Onsager suggested to Theodorsen that he obtain a doctorate in physics. Theodorsen's thesis dealt with thermodynamic and aerodynamic themes that were to permeate much of his later work, which was developed in two parts: 1) shock waves and explosions and 2) combustion and detonation. Through the urging of Joseph Ames, president of Johns Hopkins University and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), Theodorsen went to NACA in 1929 as an associate physicist. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics The NACA facility adjoined Langley Air Force Base near Hampton, Virginia. The only in-house research arm of NACA at the time, it had a highly motivated young staff. The work atmosphere was informal though competitive, with much open stimulating discussion. However, conditions were rather primitive. The library consisted of one small shelf of books. Theodorsen used as his mainstays Hutte Mechanical Engineering Handbook and a set of the 1929 edition of the Handbuch der Physik. Within a short time Theodorsen was made head of the Physical Research Division, the other research divisions being Engine Research and Aerodynamics. Langley NACA was then in the process of expanding its experimental facilities to include a Full Scale Wind Tunnel and a Hydrodynamic Towing Basin for testing flying boat hulls. The proposed location of the towing basin had formerly been a bombing range. One of Theodorsen's first activities was the invention of an instrument for detecting buried metals and on its first use it located a live bomb. The ensuing years were highly productive ones for Theodorsen in a number of experimental and theoretical areas. Theodorsen improved thin airfoil theory by introducing the angle of best streamlining, developed the now classical and elegant theory of arbitrary wing sections, performed the first in-house noise research, worked on fire prevention in aircraft and on means of icing removal and prevention, contributed to the theory of open, closed and partially open wind-tunnel test sections, developed the basic theory of aircraft flutter and its verification, made early measurements of skin friction at transonic and supersonic speeds, developed the use of freon for experimental aeroelastic work, gave damping properties of structures and expanded general propeller theory. During World War II Theodorsen was called on for the analysis and troubleshooting of many aircraft problems and to help devise necessary modifications.\\"The Cowling Program: Experimental Impasse and Beyond\\". Aerospace Historian, Fall 1985. Expanding on significant themes Theodorsen was an innovative practical engineer at a time in which most of his contemporary theoretical aerodynamists were at educational institutions and thus not involved in practical engineering solutions. Theodorsen’s work is especially significant in that it still plays an important role in current research and technology.\\"The Piston Engine – Part 2\\". Jetrader, September/October 2008, p. 30. The theory of arbitrary airfoils based on conformal mapping developed by Theodorsen, is a model of classical applied mathematics. Two key concepts made Theodorsen’s approach different from and a clear improvement on the methods that preceded it, such as that of von Mises and von Karman. One was the important use of the complex variable not in the usual form of a polynomial or power series, but in the form of an exponential to power series. The equation led directly to the basic boundary value equation which, as an integral equation, represents an exact solution of the problem in terms of the given airfoil data. This solution gave the exact pressure distribution around an airfoil of arbitrary shape. Seldom in aeronautics are solutions \\"exact\\". This is one of the very few. The method has been automated so that complete pressure distributions for a given airfoil section can be obtained in a matter of seconds. The philosophy in Theodorsen’s approach was that an exact formulation is often simpler and preferable to an approximate one and that although approximations are essential in applied mathematics, they should be delayed as much as possible.Raymond L. Barger. \\"Adaptation of the Theodorsen Theory to the Representation of an Airfoil as a Combination of a Lifting Line and a Thickness Distribution\\". (NASA TN D-8117, Langley Research Center). Theodorsen's approach on flutter was also direct and clean, leading to an exact solution, as contrasted with previous implicit and approximate results. This exact flutter solution including results for control surfaces has had a key role in the development of flutter methods in the United States. It has enabled an engineering feel for the effects of variables and parameters in complex situations and has been available as a model against which approximate solutions can be compared. Although Theodorsen leaned strongly toward basic theoretical analysis, he usually accompanied his work with experimental verification. He was highly innovative in engineering and experimental activities, where he always sought a theoretical framework or was guided by physical intuition. He was responsible for proposing a wind tunnel for flutter work that employed a mixture of air and freon with variable pressure to greatly increase the scope of research with aeroelastic models throughout the Mach range and with lower horsepower requirements. The Transonic Dynamics Wind Tunnel now used exclusively for aeroelastic research is based on the same principles. Another unique facility due Theodorsen was the helicopter rotor tower for aerodynamic and noise research. Ideal propeller dynamics was given a definitive treatment in several reports and a book. Theodorsen was the earliest to obtain reliable skin-friction drag data at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic speeds.John L. Crigler. \\"Application of Theodorsen’s Theory to Propeller Design\\". Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, 1948. Later years After leaving NACA in 1946, Theodorsen helped organize and administer the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (Aeronautical Institute of Technology) (1947–1950) in Brazil. Then he served as Chief Scientist for the U.S. Air Force from 1950 to 1954, during which time he did important work on the structure of turbulence. Theodorsen then became the Chief of Research for Republic Aviation Corporation, manufacturer of the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane of World War II, and the later F-84 Thunderjet and the F-105 Thunderchief, a post from which he retired in 1962 when he became an active consultant to Sikorsky Helicopter Corporation, where he specialized in ducted propeller work and helicopter rotors. Turbulence theory A significant development was his contribution to the structure of turbulence in a paper honoring Ludwig Prandtl’s 75th birthday. The universality of turbulence from microphenomena to astrophysics is well known. Turbulence remains the major unsolved domain of fluid mechanics. Theodorsen identified the main turbulence-creating terms in the equations of motion as (q x curl q . curl curl q); he showed that two-dimensional turbulence cannot exist; that vortex lines stretching and bending is the important mechanism and ingredient of turbulence. He also discussed the hierarchy of vortices (Kolmogorov). Theory of relativity Although Theodorsen's life work was in aerodynamics, and he published numerous books and papers in that field, he had other interests. In particular, he wrote a paper, \\"Relativity and Classical Physics\\" which sought to show that the results of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity could be obtained without resorting to curved space-time by a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitation. The paper presents \\"a successful transformation of the theory of relativity into classical physics... The mathematical entities of the Einstein development have been redefined into rational physical quantities and rearranged in an organized classical framework. Einstein's space-time has been eliminated and replaced by cognitive time.\\" It was published in the Proceedings of the DKNVS Theodorsen Colloquium and on two later occasions.Proceedings of the Theodorsen Colloquium 1976.

Personal life In 1922 Theodorsen married Johanne Magdelene Hoem. Her family was from Trondheim. They were married in Nidaros Cathedral, the largest existing medieval church in Scandinavia. The wedding party was held at the Britannia Hotel. Their daughter Muriel Gerd-Preutz and sons Theodore Elliott and John Willman were all born in the United States. In 1976, Theodorsen was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters also held a colloquium in his honor at Trondheim. After a short illness, Theodorsen died in 1978 at the age of 81 at his home in Centerport, Long Island, New York.Æresdoktorer . Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

It connects State Highway 20 in the south at Mt Roskill to State Highway 16 in the west at Point Chevalier, and is a part of the Western Ring Route. The Waterview Connection is 4.5 km long, of which 2.5 km are in the form of twin tunnels. The Waterview Tunnel supersedes the Lyttelton Road Tunnel as New Zealand's longest road tunnels. By 2026, the link is expected to carry 83,000 vehicles a day. There are three lanes of traffic in each tunnel.  Planning history  The project had an extensive planning history, with the earliest consultation in 2000, though the proposal for a route roughly in the area dates from much earlier.  Routes considered  Oakley Creek, near where the bored tunnels in the final (2010) alignments stop (and will be joined to cut and cover built tunnels for the last section towards SH16). Several routes were considered, all being variations of either a connection to SH16 along the Rosebank Peninsula (e.g. AR1, AR3) or at the Great North Road interchange at Waterview (e.g. AW1, AW4).Consultation (from the Transit New Zealand website) It was generally assumed that below-ground construction would be required where AR3 passed through Avondale Heights, to a maximum depth of 41 m. On the basis of technical and environmental assessments, the AR3 and AW4 route options were dismissed. Transit New Zealand selected the Waterview connection as its preferred route,\\"AW1 is the confirmed preferred route for the Waterview Connection\\" Newsletter 8, February 2006 (from the SH20 project website of Transit New Zealand) with the support of the Auckland City CouncilDecember 2005, Auckland City voted to support the extension of SH20 through Waterview and Waitakere City Council,\\"Waitakere City conditionally support Waterview option\\" 9 February 2006, City Development Committee page 2-9\\"Waitakere City conditionally support Waterview option\\" 27 November 2006, Council page 8 over the Rosebank option, which was the preferred route of the Auckland Regional Council.14 March 2006, ARC media release ARC supports Rosebank route for SH20 extension The previous AW1 and AW4 routes favoured a New North Road interchange with ramps facing south, and full connections at the Waterview interchange. The preferred route was announced with a Great North Road interchange replacing New North Road and no southbound access at Waterview. This proved unpopular with local residents, and it was considered unlikely a bored tunnel could accommodate an interchange because of its depth.  Bored tunnels preferred  On 7 February 2008, bored tunnels were announced as Transit's preferred option. The NZ Transport Agency's preferred option was a pair of two-lane tunnels costing $1.89 billion, rather than a pair of three-lane tunnels costing $2.14 billion. NZTA's traffic modelling indicated that two-lane tunnels would reach capacity within 10 years of operation. Map of Tunnel Route Transit NZ's board resolved to seek a designation over land for a $1.89 billion pair of motorway tunnels through Waterview.4 June 2008 TRANSIT BOARD SEEKS TO PROTECT TUNNEL ROUTE FOR WATERVIEW The board called for a report from officials on managing fumes from the tunnel \\"to benchmark the proposed approach incorporated in the design work to date against current international best practice\\". In response to submissions questioning the adequacy of just two traffic lanes running in each direction, it sought a comparative assessment of the operational performance and costs of providing three-lane tunnels, initially estimated at $2.14 billion. Public-private partnership investigation The government set up a joint public-private sector steering group to investigate the feasibility of a public-private partnership (PPP) as a procurement method for the Waterview Connection Project, evaluating the PPP alongside a conventional public sector procurement method to determine how the two methods compared in terms of value for money. The steering group had as an independent chairperson, Sir Brian Elwood, and reported directly to the Ministers of Finance and Transport. It was announced on 26 August 2008 that the steering group had advised the Government that a public-private partnership (PPP) - which would require a $2 toll per trip - was the best way of building the new $2 billion section of the city's Western Ring Route. Transport Minister Annette King asked officials to do more work on several critical factors before the Government committed to a PPP.  Air quality concerns  In October 2008 the NZ Transport Agency released report findings which showed that tunnel emissions would have a negligible effect on local air quality. These findings were disputed by Waterview Primary School representatives, who claimed that the report hadn't taken into account the impact of tolling \\"which could add more traffic to surface roads\\", hadn't given sufficient consideration to \\"international best practice on air filtering\\", and had failed to account for \\"ventilation fans being turned off during off-peak times, allowing emissions to escape through the tunnel openings\\". They also asked for reconsideration of \\"taking a section of the school’s playing field for use during the five-year construction period\\". Concern was also expressed by developer Greg Burgess, who had consent for building 83 new homes 19 metres away from the Owairaka ventilation stack. The developer wanted the ventilation stack moved further away, but there were worries that fumes might be pushed closer to Christ the King School.  Request to reconsider Rosebank route  The Auckland Regional Council requested NZTA to reconsider whether the proposed Waterview Connection was the most cost-effective way of completing the Western Ring Road, with a reconsideration of the costs and benefits of the alternative Rosebank route.ARC agenda 24 November 2008 ARC minutes 24 November 2008  Cost of bored tunnels questioned  In 2009, the CEO of Federated Farmers, Conor English (brother of Finance Minister Bill English), announced that Federated Farmers wanted the government to review the tunnelling with a view to cancelling it. He argued in an editorial that the project represented a \\"tunnel with no hill\\", costed at that time at about $1.9 billion or about $600 million a kilometre. Therefore, the motorway should instead be built as a surface road, and the savings invested into water storage projects benefitting farming. On 30 January 2009 Transport Minister Steven Joyce announced his concern with the $3.16 billion cost (including financing costs of more than $500 million and an upgrade of the nearby Northwestern Motorway for $240 million) of three-lane tunnels. Because he was \\"not comfortable\\" with the idea of reducing the tunnels to two lanes with no ability to enlarge them for future traffic demand, he gave officials until April to review all options for a connection of State Highway 20 to the Northwestern Motorway at Waterview, including a potentially disruptive surface route through Mount Albert and previously discarded \\"cut and cover\\" proposals. He was unable to predict a completion date for Auckland's 42 km western ring route, saying officials regarded a 2015 target of the previous Labour government as \\"aspirational\\".  Combination tunnel method announced  Local protests, such as here at the end of the existing stub of SH20, played a role in a combined surface and tunnel being reconsidered. On 13 May 2009 NZTA announced its new preferred route for the Waterview Connection motorway as a combination of surface, bored tunnel and cut and cover tunnel. The tunnels would be constructed with provision for three lanes in each direction. A raised surface motorway through Alan Wood ParkTransit Waterview Connection website, Allan Wood Reserve cross- section and the short section between the bored and cut and cover tunnel portals near the Great North Rd and Blockhouse Bay Rd intersectionTransit Waterview Connection website, Artist's impression of tunnel portal at Avondale Heights were the largest differences between this new preferred route and the previous bored tunnel option.Transit Waterview Connection website, Route Map At $1,165 million, it was cheaper than the $1,974 million two-lane bored tunnel option and the $2,335 million three-lane bored tunnel option.Transit Waterview Connection website, presentation of preferred route  Combined surface/tunnel alignment confirmed  On 11 September 2009 the NZTA Board confirmed the combined surface/tunnel alignment for the Waterview Connection. The Board was confident that the project's effects could be managed in a fair and reasonable way and that many of the community concerns would be addressed through good design. Over the following two months the NZTA was to provide the Board with details on how a range of issues would be addressed,NZTA Media Release 11 Sep 09 including: * the subsequent process of engagement to be adopted with respect to the community and other stakeholders; * air quality effects; * open space replacement and enhancement; * noise mitigation; * other environmental impacts; * tunnel design options to minimise or remove the separation between the 'bored' and 'cut and cover' tunnels; * urban design – including cycle and walkway connections and access; and investigating a 'central' interchange;NZTA Board paper 09/08/0250 Report on Community and Stakeholder Engagement (Supplementary Paper) Subject to board approval on 27 November 2009 of a final design for the motorway, the NZTA was to lodge a land designation application early in 2010 with Auckland City, for a construction start in 2011-12 and completion in 2015.NZTA Board meeting dates and agendas  \\"Final\\" alignment confirmed  On 21 December 2009, NZTA announced that the tunnels would be built further east as continuous tunnels without an (open) gap halfway, and expressed confidence that they would be able to be completed within the original project budget. NZTA argued that this would be the most cost-effective option for constructing this section, and would require 205 houses to be bulldozed. Underground land would need to be purchased from 105 properties. The board had decided against including a central interchange at New North Road. Construction on the project was proposed to start in mid to late 2011 with an anticipated completion date in the 2015/16 financial year.NZTA Media Release 21 Dec 09 The revised route mapRevised Route Map 21 Dec 09 shows road header constructed tunnels running from Alan Wood Park opposite Range View / Stewart Roads, under the north end of Hendon Ave and under Pak 'n Save, continuing under the ends of Powell St & Craddock St, under the Phyllis St softball fields, under the Oakley Creek waterfall and reserve with a final section of cut & cover under Great North Rd and emerging in Waterview Park as per previous options.  \\"Road of National Significance\\" & Fast-tracking  In 2009, Minister of Transport Steven Joyce declared the project one of the \\"Roads of National Significance\\". Crucially, this step allowed the application to be considered by a new governmental body, the Environmental Protection Authority, a fast-track process which bypasses normal resource consent and Environment Court processes, in favour of a fixed 9-month process led by a \\"Board of Enquiry\\", whose decision cannot be appealed except on points of law. The decision to fast-track was cited as necessary to avoid approval delays which had held up other projects for over 15 years, though local groups were pessimistic about their chance to achieve fair mitigation within the tight process. The tunnel sections would now be approximately 2.4 km long. Also included in the fast-tracked project was the decision to undertake significant capacity-related widening works on State Highway 16, which are outside of the Waterview area (from St Lukes Road interchange to beyond Te Atatū), which were bundled into the application process which consists of 54 resource consents and 7 designations. With around 40 folders of materials and plans to go through, local community groups expressed anger in October 2010 that they would have only four weeks to formulate submissions regarding the fast-tracked applications. Calls by Auckland City Council and an affected community board to extend the deadline were rejected on the grounds of the tight statutory timeframe.  Consent approvals =Process and hearing The consenting process was (as of the end of 2010) continuing in parallel with the tendering process in order to save time (i.e. NZTA was assuming that the project would achieve consent largely as applied for). On 3 September 2010, NZTA's application for designation and resource consents for the Waterview Connection section of the Western Ring Route ‘road of national significance project’ was referred to a Board of Inquiry, chaired by Environment Court judge Laurie Newhook. The EPA publicly notified the application package on 18 September 2010, with the period for public submissions closing 15 October 2010.http://www.epa.govt.nz/applications/waterview/news-and- notices/presentation-24-09-2010.pdf Evidence needed to be produced and provided to NZTA by 17 December 2010. The Board of Inquiry hearing was to run February to April 2011 (actually taking 16 days of hearings until March), with a draft decision by the Board of Inquiry expected in May, with the final decision due by 20 June 2011. This was later slightly pushed out to 30 June. A number of matters came into public focus during the hearings process. One of them was the shape and locations of the two proposed ventilation shaft buildings near the northern and southern tunnel entries, and their likely effect on local visual amenity (with the shafts, at 25m-27m height, proposed to tower visibly over surrounding suburban areas) and local air pollution levels (where an indepependent report considered that the NZTA had been too optimistic in terms of pollution conditions during traffic jams and due to induced demand). Other matters included effects on local neighbourhoods, even those where demolition was not expected, such as for several apartment buildings directly adjacent to a multi-year construction site.  Board of Inquiry decision  On 9 May 2011 it was reported that the board had directed NZTA to, among other mitigation changes: * build the northern tunnel exhaust tower on the other (eastern) side of Great North Rd, further away from Waterview Primary School than planned - NZTA had opposed the change arguing extra costs of up to $29 million * build the southern tunnel exhaust tower, in Owairaka, 70 to 80 metres southeast of NZTA's preferred site, away from a narrow chokepoint in Alan Wood Park, requiring a short extension to the 2.5 km tunnels, also reducing the project's open space displacement - NZTA had opposed the change arguing extra costs of up to $21 million * build the two towers to a height of \\"15 metres above ground - not more - not less\\" * pay $8 million towards construction of a walk- and cycleway between Owairaka and Waterview, to mitigate open space loss by providing local connections for the communities The draft decision on the overall project was released end of May 2011, confirming the matters of the earlier direction, with the final result not significantly different when released end of June 2011. While community groups still expressed negative views about the motorway after the hearings process, many noted that they felt that the tunneling (compared to a 2009 surface alignment) and the added mitigation prescribed on NZTA by the board, had helped to make the result more acceptable for the local communities. While some described the process as a \\"David and Goliath\\" fight, most agreed that the board had handled the process well, and listened to local concerns.  Construction = Start of enabling works  In March 2010, NZTA announced that $10 million enabling works would start at the southeastern end of the route, diverting a sewer line and a tributary of Oakley Creek in preparation for the new Maioro St interchange. While the works would occur on land already designated as motorway, local groups were concerned that the move preempted the consenting process for the main alignment, which still was to happen at that stage. In October 2010, NZTA signed a contract with Fletcher construction to complete stage 2 of the $40m project at the Maioro Street interchange.NZTA media release, 29 Oct 2010 In November 2010, NZTA continued to negotiate the acquiring of the Faulkner Collins factory and offices from Stoddard Rd in Mt Roskill under the public works act, in order to make way for the Maioro St interchange connection to Stoddard Rd. Faulkner Collins employees took turns sleeping at the factory, fearing that NZTA would change the locks during the night. Local jobs must be protected in Faulkner Collins dispute say Local Board Members, InfoNews 12 Nov 2010  Contract awarded  16 November 2010, NZTA announced the two shortlisted competitors to construct the project, being two alliances of companies, one jointly led by McConnell Dowell and Fletcher Construction and one led by Fulton Hogan in partnership with Australia's Leighton Contractors. A third consortium led by Baulderstone missed out on selection. As of May 2010, it was known that each of the two remaining tenderers had about 140-150 staff preparing bids for the project, and one tenderer, after the decision, noted that they had spent about $18 million preparing the bid. Construction start was expected to be before Christmas 2011. In mid-2011, it was announced that the 'Well Connected' consortium led by Fletcher Construction had won the tender, for $1.3 billion. The consortium also included McConnell Dowell Obayashi Corporation, PB New Zealand, Beca Infrastructure and Tonkin + Taylor, as well as five sub-alliance partners and contractors: SICE, Wilson Tunnelling, Downer EDI Works, Boffa Miskell and Warren and Mahoney. The consortium worked on the alliance model, in which financial risks and incentives are shared among all partners.  Proposal to relocate northern vent stack  In December 2011, the construction consortium proposed relocating the northern stack from the east side of Great North Rd, to the north side of Herdman Street. As the Earth Pressure Balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) would be able to bore much closer to the surface than techniques assumed during the design phase, the cut and cover tunneling technique was not required below Great North Road. That meant that a duct below Great North Rd to a stack on the east side could not be constructed at the same time as the tunnels. The northern location for the stack had been studied earlier but dismissed because of greater cost, and the location had also created concerns among locals due to greater visual effects than that finally chosen by the Board of Inquiry.  Enabling works  Enabling works began in January 2012 between the Maioro Street interchange and Alan Wood Park and included: * Establishment activities (e.g. construction zone fencing /project and way-finding signage) * Removal of properties from within designation * Construction of two temporary soccer fields (senior and junior), ablution block and a temporary car park at Valonia Street (with field drainage and grass seeding from March 2012) * Site access for heavy vehicles from Richardson Rd (and 8 metre-wide haul road west through Hendon Park) * Construction of temporary stream crossings (for construction vehicle access) * Excavation and temporary diversion of a section of Oakley Creek adjacent to the sports fields to facilitate their construction * Excavation of new stream channels in Alan Wood Park and temporary diversion of sections of Oakley Creek into the new alignment * Diversion of utility services around Richardson Road to enable the construction of a road diversion * Temporary realignment of Richardson Road while building new Richardson Rd bridge. Local electricity distribution company Vector also carried out enabling works to supply electricity to the tunnel portal sites for construction, and included: *Installing an 11 kV feeder line from the Chevalier zone substation on Great North Road to the northern portal site to supply the northern portal during construction. *Installing a 33 kV capable, 22 kV operating, underground cable from the Avondale zone substation on Blockhouse Bay Road to the southern portal site to supply the southern portal and the TBM during construction. This also involved installing a 33 kV capable switchboard at Avondale to connect the tunnel supply to the two 22 kV cables feeding Avondale zone substation from the national grid at Mount Roskill. *Installing a new 11 kV local feeder line from Chevalier zone substation to the Waterview area, to transfer some existing load off Avondale zone substation, as Avondale could not supply both the TBM and its existing load without overloading. *Installing a second 22/11 kV transformer at the Chevalier zone substation, as the existing transformer could not supply the northern portal and Waterview feeder lines without overloading.  Southern Portal works  Beginning July 2012 Northern Portal works and Great North Road Interchange Beginning May 2013 (note that works at the northern end will not initially involve tunnel boring)  Tunnelling =Opening On 24 March 2017, it was announced that the planned April 2017 opening of the $1.6 billion project was being held up for another two months because of issues with its fire sprinklers. On 11 June 2017 it was announced that the tunnel would open in early July 2017. The tunnels opened at 12:47 am on 2 July 2017, with three police cars leading the first vehicles through the northbound tunnel. Mitigation and related projects Great North Road and the overbridge of the Northwestern Cycleway. The tunnel will surface just to the west (right hand of the picture). A number of not directly motorway-related projects will form part of the SH20 connection works, either to mitigate negative effects on the environment, or to provide for other transport modes. Avondale–Southdown railway line Enabling works and allowance for the Avondale–Southdown Line are a part of constructing SH20.FAQ How will the new section of motorway affect the existing Southdown rail designation (from the SH20 project website of Transit New Zealand)SH20 Mt Roskill includes enabling works for a future rail line (from the Transit New Zealand website) KiwiRail sees this route as strategically important as it is the only real alternative for a cross-isthmus heavy rail route, as upgrading of the existing Newmarket Line is not realistically feasible or possible. KiwiRail requested that any tunnel construction not preclude rail above it in the future, nor the possibility of rail being trenched to cross below New North Road to connect to the existing North Auckland Line. Passive open space Passive open space will be lost during construction of the motorway to construction lay down areas and lost permanently where the motorway & associated structures are built. NZTA has proposed replacement passive open space below & around the Waterview interchange ramps, and the existing privately owned empty site adjoining Alan Wood Park and future surface motorway.NZTA project website Active open space The existing fields at Waterview Reserve and Alan Wood Park will be lost. NZTA propose to construct new fields adjacent to the Waterview interchange, and above the tunnel entrances at Alan Wood Park. These would likely be used as construction lay down areas during construction. During the project Expo's, NZTA had proposed to develop additional fields at Phyllis St for use during the construction period but this was dropped for the EPA submission.Expo Posters Walkways and cycleways Documents shown during the public consultation phase in early 2010 showed a proposed walkway and cycleway generally following the line of the motorway / tunnel alignment, connecting the existing SH16 Cycleway with the end of the then-existing SH20 Cycleway, including a walking/cycling bridge over Oakley Creek at Phyllis Street. However, at lodgement time in 2010, NZTA clarified that it would only build cycleways along the sections that are not located in a tunnel, leaving the potential for a connecting cycleway between SH16 and SH20 in doubt. After a several-months-long hearing process, the Board of Inquiry in mid-2011 however came to the decision that a walkway and cycleway along the tunnel alignment was a required mitigation for open space loss in the areas around both tunnel portals (though not technically as transport mitigation), and that NZTA will have to pay for (though not build) the facility. Cycling advocates Cycle Action Auckland lauded the decision as a resounding win for cycling in Auckland, and a key part in making the Waterview Connection into a truly multi-modal project. The approximate route of the cycleway will be from near Alford Street in Waterview, crossing a new bridge over Oakley Creek, then through Phyllis Reserve, before crossing to Alan Wood Park in New Windsor/Owairaka via a new bridge over the rail line at Soljak Place. The bridge from Soljak Place over the railway to Harbutt Reserve is the first priority of the Alan Wood Park / Soljak Place to Waterview area cycleway, public consultation to be undertaken early 2012.ONW community liaison meeting 2, meeting notes, 13 Dec 2011 Auckland Transport designed the 2.5 km long \\"Waterview Shared Path\\" from Alan Wood reserve, with construction happening from March 2016 to mid-2017.

Primarily known today as the first credited big-screen role for Julia Roberts, Satisfaction is also one of the few theatrical productions by either Aaron Spelling or the NBC network. Plot Jennie Lee is the lead singer of an all- girl rock band in Baltimore named the Mystery. At her high school graduation, Jennie gives her valedictorian speech at the ceremony while fellow band member, bass guitarist Daryle is accepting a marriage proposal from her high school sweetheart Frankie. Jennie and the band are planning to go to Florida to audition for a gig at a nightclub in West Palm Beach, Florida for the summer. However, problems seem to plague their plans when, first Jennie's older brother (and caretaker) doesn't want to let Jennie go because he feels it will dissuade her from continuing her college plans; second, the band's keyboardist has unexpectedly left the band, and third, Mooch (the drummer) insulted a gang member who then in turn destroyed the band's van. Mooch tells the band that she borrowed another van from her friend but in fact, assisted by the help of guitarist Billy, she stole the gang member's personal van. After recruiting a male keyboard player Nicky, the band heads south to audition for the gig. Arriving at the nightclub after closing hours, the band fears they have missed their audition. Not wanting to have to return, the band finds the owner Martin Falcon's home address and decide to make him listen to them play. However, when they arrive at his beach house, they let themselves in and find Falcon is not home. They do find Hamlet, Falcon's pet Doberman Pincher dog, who, after Billy sings him a song, becomes fast friends with the band. Falcon arrives, drunk and assumes the band are thieves. Explaining who they are, Jennie pleads with Falcon to listen to their music, but Falcon informs them that they are in fact a day early, the auditions for the gig isn't until the next night. Having very little money and no place to stay, Falcon offers them the room that the winners are supposed to be staying at for the summer. The \\"room\\" turns out to be a tool shack with room enough for 5 beds. The next night, the band auditions and the overwhelming applauding crowd response convinces Falcon to hire the band for the summer. The band members stick out like a sore thumb in the preppy beach side area they temporarily reside in, especially Mooch, who refuses to take off her black leather jacket, although the weather is hot. Daryle (who has broken up with Frankie) started dating a local rich boy and tried to get the band invited to his parties. Billy, outside her comfort zone, started taking more pills than usual to cope with her depression. Jennie encouraged Mooch to spend time with Nicky, who seemed to have a crush on her and Jennie began a romantic relationship with the older Falcon. Falcon tells Jennie he has a music agent friend who books bands for gigs all over Europe, and is going to be coming to the club to watch the band perform. Falcon, after learning from Jennie that she is considering moving in with him, breaks up with Jennie because he doesn't want her to give up any opportunities because of him. Billy nearly overdoses and Frankie causes a small riot when he goes to the club and sees Daryle on stage being ogled by the local guys. On the night the music agent goes to the club, Jennie runs out just after performing a song written by Falcon especially for the band and the street gang finally catches up with Mooch for stealing their van. The band all help out Mooch as she fights off the leader and finally Hamlet the dog chases the gang from the club, who are then arrested. When asked about what the music agent said, Jennie implies that the agent loved their music but she turned down his offer for the band to play in European clubs. Upset with Jennie that she would turn down such a huge opportunity, Nicky explains to the rest of the band that the music agent did not want the band, he only wanted Jennie to stand in front of studio musicians. But Jennie decides that it wouldn't have been any fun without them. Jennie says goodbye to Falcon and the band heads home with Hamlet now a part of the band.

It was the first book ever printed in Sweden (1483). The fables are organised in sections according to the different kinds of protagonists: first the astronomical, then the elements, followed by living things. The fables tell of the interactions of various anthropomorphized animals and ends with a moral explanation. Common human problems are solved according to the teachings of the Bible, church fathers or classical Greek or Roman philosophy. The author is unknown, but surviving manuscripts suggest the fables may have been gathered and edited by either Mayno de Mayneri (Magninus Mediolanensis) or Nicolaus Pergamenus, both active in the 14th century. A number of the fables are from Aesop, such as The Lion's Share, The Frog and the Ox and The Wolf and the Lamb. Publication left thumb The book was first published in 1480 by Gerard Leeu at Gouda, and several times reprinted by him. Each tale was illustrated by a woodcut. A second edition followed in 1481. He printed at least three more Latin editions, one more at Gouda in 1482 and two at Antwerp in 1486 and 1491. He also published two editions in Dutch in 1481 and 1482 and one in French in 1482. The popularity of the work is clear from the number of editions published. Other printers soon published Latin texts: Conrad Winters de Homborch in 1481 at Cologne, Jean Bellot in 1500 at Geneva, Claude Nourry in 1509 at Lyon and Pigouchet in 1510 at Paris. It was the first book printed in Sweden. It was printed on Riddarholmen island in Stockholm on December 20, 1483 by Johann Snell, an immigrant from Rostock. Five copies from the original run survive today. At the book’s 500th anniversary in 1983, Bra Böcker, a Swedish publishing house, produced a facsimile edition with added translation and commentary. The first English translation, The Dialoges of Creatures Moralysed, was published around 1530. In 1584 the book was printed by de Jode for Plantin as the Apologi Creaturarum, with plates by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder.

Possessing a powerful shot which allowed him to score several goals from free kicks, he spent the vast majority of his professional career in Portugal, representing four clubs and amassing Primeira Liga totals of 141 games and 13 goals over the course of eight seasons. Football career Born in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Maurício did not start playing organized football until well into his 20s. He represented mainly modest sides in his country, with the exception of Fluminense FC in 2002, helping the Rio de Janeiro team to the Campeonato Carioca. In 2003, Maurício signed with S.C. Braga in Portugal, being rarely used by the Minho side during three years (he was inclusively demoted to the reserves) and also being loaned to fellow Primeira Liga club C.F. Estrela da Amadora, where he excelled, scoring four goals as the team finished in mid-table in the 2005–06 season. Subsequently, returned to Braga, Maurício left for the Pohang Steelers of South Korea in the 2007 January transfer window. After appearing rarely in the K-League, he returned to Portugal and former club Estrela, netting another four goals as it again managed to maintain its top flight status after finishing 13th, notably in a 2–2 home draw against eventual champions FC Porto. After one year in Greece with Ergotelis FC, 33-year-old Maurício returned once again to Portugal, signing with C.D. Feirense in the second level.

M. Pollock, was a Republican member of the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1901–1902 and served as Speaker of the North Dakota House of Representatives. He was also a member of the constitutional convention that drafted the North Dakota Constitution in 1889. Personal life Pollock was born in Racine County, Wisconsin to James Pollock and Evaline Halstead. His father was a farmer who moved to Wisconsin from New York City in 1848. Pollock had 8 brothers and sisters. He attended public schools in Wisconsin and studied law, passing the Wisconsin Bar in 1879. In 1880, he came to North Dakota via Fargo, North Dakota. According to some of his descendants, he originally was discouraged by the \\"river town\\" and the climate, and briefly considered returning to Racine. However, the Northern Pacific Railroad was being built through the area, and he ultimately followed it west to the current town of Casselton, North Dakota where he settled. Within a year and a half, he had established himself in the town, and opened a law practice. In December 1881 he married Christine Corse in Racine, and they had seven children. He was a Mason and member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Political career During his time in Casselton, Pollock alternatively served as the city attorney and mayor. He was also a member of the 1889 constitutional convention that drafted the North Dakota Constitution. In 1891, Governor John Burke appointed him to the commission tasked with compiling the new state's laws. He also served as state attorney for Cass County from 1893 to 1897. In 1897, he moved to Fargo where he reestablished his law practice. In 1900, he was elected as a Republican to the North Dakota House of Representatives and selected by the members of that body as its speaker. He represented Fargo in the 9th legislative district. Pollock died October 19, 1920, at the age of 65. References This article incorporates text from the Compendium of History and Biography of North Dakota (1900), a publication now in the public domain.

It is spoken by the Kallawaya people, a group of traditional itinerant healers in the Andes in their medicinal healing practice living in Charazani, the highlands north of Lake Titicaca, and Tipuani. Characteristics Kallawaya is a mixed language. The grammar is partially Quechua in morphology, but most of its words are from either unknown sources or from an otherwise extinct language family, Pukina. Pukina was abandoned in favor of Quechua, Aymara, and Spanish. Kallawaya is also a secret language, passed only by father to son, or grandfather to grandson, or rarely, to daughters if a practitioner has no sons. It is not used in normal family dialogue. Although its use is primarily ritual, used secretly for initiated men, Kallawaya may be a part of everyday conversation between those familiar with it. Kallawaya was one of the subjects of Ironbound Films' 2008 American documentary film The Linguists, in which two linguists attempted to document several moribund languages. Bolivians refer to the region where the speakers live as \\"Qollahuayas,\\" meaning \\"place of the medicines\\", because the Kallawaya are renowned herbalists. Since they treat or cure with plants, minerals, animal products, and rituals, peasants refer to the speakers as \\"Qolla kapachayuh\\", meaning \\"lords of the medicine bag\\".

The candy is similar to Turkish Delight and was first developed in 1918 by apple farmers as a way to dispose of surplus crops. A 2009 effort to legally designate Aplets & Cotlets as Washington's official candy failed due to provincial competition between legislators from the state's two geo- cultural regions. Description Aplets & Cotlets are small, gelatin-like confections baked in powdered-sugar around walnuts. They are similar in taste and consistency to Turkish Delight, on which they are based, but the pectin in the fruit acts as a gelling agent. Aplets are made with apples and Cotlets are made with apricots. History=Development Apples have traditionally been the most important cash crop in Washington. By the 1920s, the state had become the leading producer of the fruit in the United States. In 2003, Washington produced more apples than the rest of the United States combined. In the early 20th century Armenian immigrants Armen Tertsagian and Mark Balaban, proprietors of an apple orchard in Cashmere, Washington, began producing Aplets as a way of disposing of their surplus crop; the idea for the candy came from their faint recollections of eating Turkish delight as children. Aplets were followed, several years later, with Cotlets. The candies were originally sold at a roadside fruit stand but gained greater attention in 1962 as a result of the Seattle World's Fair. Manufactured versions of the candy are limited to those produced by Liberty Orchards of Cashmere, Tertsagian and Balaban's original company. According to the firm, there is \\"not a huge market\\" for the product outside Washington, though in the late 1990s the company began limited retailing at national chain stores such as Target (the bulk of Aplet & Cotlet sales prior to this had been in local retailers like Frederick & Nelson, Bartell Drugs, and Pay 'n Save, and through its mail-order catalog). Despite their obscurity nationally, they are available at many farmstead style shops west of the Rocky Mountains. Recipes for homemade versions also exist. Official status In 2009, members of the Washington State Legislature attempted to designate Aplets & Cotlets the \\"official candy of the state of Washington\\". The measure faced opposition from some who felt Almond Roca or Mountain Bar should receive the honor instead. In its report on the measure, the House of Representatives' Committee on Government and Tribal Affairs claimed that designating the candy as the state's official candy would help strengthen unity between the state's two geo-cultural regions, explaining that Aplets & Cotlets \\"represents the goal of one Washington – Eastern Washington where much of the fruit is grown and Western Washington where products use transportation links to get to market\\". The bill ultimately failed to pass in 2009 and after a re-introduction in 2010.

She is the founder of The Donna Foundation, which provides the necessary funds to care for local women living with breast cancer. On September 19, 2007, Deegan stated that a CT scan showed a small \\"suspicious\\" lesion in her lower left lung. A PET scan confirmed the lesion was there, but nothing more was found anywhere in her body. Initially, doctors were uncertain if the lesion was indeed cancer. However, on September 21, 2007, after surgery to remove the lesion, it was confirmed that it was; Deegan yet again went under treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy. 26.2 with Donna On June 22, 2006 the Mayo Clinic and The Donna Foundation announced the inaugural run of the 26.2 with Donna: The National Marathon to Fight Breast Cancer, benefiting Mayo Clinic and women living with breast cancer.

Deegan announced that over $800,000 was raised to benefit the Mayo Clinic and women living with breast cancer. This money was used to help further a plan in which specialized treatment is used, instead of a \\"one size fits all\\" treatment. The second run of the race took place on February 15, 2009. Deegan stated in a recent interview that she was hoping the race would be bigger and better than the inaugural, but cited tough economic times as the reason for the same turnout as the prior year's race.

It is a mystery novel primarily set in the fictional town of Wrightsville, a place that figures in several later Queen books. Plot summary Ellery Queen moves into the small town of Wrightsville, somewhere in New England, in order to get some peace and quiet so that he can write a book. As a result of renting a furnished house, he becomes peripherally involved in the story of Jim Haight and Nora Wright. Nora's father is president of the Wrightsville National bank, \\"oldest family in town\\", and when the head cashier Jim Haight became engaged to his daughter Nora, he built and furnished a house for them as a wedding present. That was three years ago—the day before the wedding, Jim Haight disappeared, the wedding was called off, and the \\"jinxed\\" house became known as \\"Calamity House\\". Ellery rents it, just before the return of Jim Haight, and the wedding is soon on again. Ellery finds some evidence that Jim is planning to poison Nora and, after the wedding, she does display some symptoms of arsenic poisoning. But it is Jim's sister Rosemary who dies after drinking a poisoned cocktail. Jim is tried for the murder and it is only after some startling and tragic events that Ellery reveals the identity of the murderer. Literary significance & criticism Inspector Queen is not seen as a character in this novel. After many popular mystery novels and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This is the first of what became known as the \\"Wrightsville\\" novels, the first three of which were at one time published in an omnibus edition called \\"The Wrightsville Murders\\". The Wrightsville novels all take place against the backdrop of that small imaginary New England town, feature some characters that repeat between books, and generally are more character-driven and realistic than the earliest Ellery Queen puzzle mysteries. They also contain a considerable amount of observation on the nature of small American towns. > Wrightsville was a place in the U.S. where people lived, worked and died in > an atmosphere of decency and independence.

They live in the Bautista Saavedra region, a mountainous area north of La Paz. They are members of the Mollo culture and are direct descendants of Tiwanaku culture. According to the UNESCO Safeguarding Project, the Kallawaya can be traced to the pre-Inca period. The Kallawaya performed brain surgery as early as 700 CE and knew how to effectively prevent and treat malaria with quinine before the Europeans. They also helped to save thousands of lives during the construction of the Panama Canal. There were 11,662 of them in 2012 throughout Bolivia.  Etymology  According to Enrique Oblitas Poblete, a Bolivian ethnobotanical specialist, Kallawaya may be a corruption of khalla-wayai (\\"beginning of a drink offering\\") or k'alla or k'alli wayai (\\"entrance into priesthood\\").  Healers  Kallawaya doctors (médicos Kallawaya), are known as the naturopathic healers of Inca kings, and as keepers of science knowledge, principally the pharmaceutical properties of vegetables, animals and minerals. Most Kallawaya healers understand how to use 300 herbs, while specialists are familiar with 600 herbs. Kallawaya women are often midwives, treat gynecological disorders, and pediatric patients. Kallawaya healers travel through northwestern Bolivia and parts of Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. Often they are on foot, walking ancient Inca trails, through the tropics, mountain valleys and highland plateaus, while looking for traditional herbs. Prior to leaving their homes to heal the sick, the Kallawayas perform a ceremonial dance. The dance and regalia are expressed as the yatiri (\\"healer\\"). The choreography is noted for the llantucha of suri, clothing made of rhea feathers and used as protection against the elements while they travel to their patients, carrying khapchos (\\"male bags\\") that contain herbs, mixes, and talismans. Groups of musicians perform Kantu, playing drums and pan flutes during the ritual ceremonies to establish contact with the spirit world before the healer visits patients.  Language  The language of their trade is the Kallawaya language, a language based on Quechua grammar but retaining an esoteric vocabulary for terms reflecting medicinal knowledge, which appears to be a remnant of the vocabulary of the now extinct Puquina language. For general conversation, they speak the more common Quechua language.  References  Further reading  * Abdel-Malek, S, et al. 1995. Drug Leads from the Kallawaya Herbalists of Bolivia. 1.

It is a mystery novel primarily set in New York City, US. Plot summary Mrs. Cornelia Potts is the elderly matriarch of the Potts family, and their large fortune was earned by the manufacture of shoes, so when a murder mystery takes place at their New York estate, it's not surprising that the newspapers refer frequently to \\"the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe\\". Cornelia has had two husbands—one deceased, one living in the household—and three children by each. Her children by her first husband are all extremely eccentric. Thurlow Potts engages in dozens of lawsuits to protect the family honor; Louella believes herself to be a great chemist and inventor, a sentiment shared by no one else; and Horatio, an adult, is determined to live the lifestyle of a child of six. By contrast, her other three children by her second husband are relatively sane—the twins Robert and Maclyn, who run the business, and the beautiful Sheila. Thurlow's lawyer Charley Paxton is engaged to Sheila and invites Ellery Queen to dinner at the Potts mansion to meet the family. Thurlow challenges Robert to a duel, using revolvers from which the bullets have been carefully extracted but, when the duel is fought, Robert is shot dead because the bullets have been returned to the gun. Next, his twin Maclyn is shot in his bed, and the body is found with whip marks on his face next to a dish of broth. As Ellery postulates that the murders are somehow tied to the nursery rhyme, the next death is that of the Old Woman herself. She dies of heart failure and leaves behind a confession to the first two murders. It is only at the marriage of Charley and Sheila that Ellery finally realizes the truth of the bizarre events and unmasks the real criminal. Literary significance & criticism After many popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel returns to the unrealistic puzzle-mystery format of earlier years, in which realism in characterization and plotting is sacrificed to the need to make events fit into the nursery-rhyme format. At the end of the novel, Sheila announces that, in order to escape the stigma associated with her heritage, she is changing her name to \\"Nikki Porter\\"; Nikki Porter is Ellery's romantic interest that was developed in radio and film but not seen in novels before this time.

The second ship to be named Skimmer by the Navy was laid down as LCI(L)-1093, a large, infantry landing craft, on 11 September 1944 by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan; launched on 23 September 1944; and commissioned on 28 September 1944.  World War II service  LCI(L)-1093 made her way through Lake Michigan and the Chicago Drainage Canal, down the Illinois River and the Mississippi river, and arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 11 October 1944. She drydocked at New Orleans, then commenced her shakedown cruise to Galveston, Texas. After completing shakedown and amphibious training, she departed Galveston on 25 November 1944.  Transfer to the Pacific Theatre  She transited the Panama Canal on 1 December, and arrived in San Diego, California, on the 18th. In mid-February 1945, following further exercises and training at San Diego, LCI(L)-1093 got underway for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, en route to Guam in the Marianas. She entered Pearl Harbor on 11 March and departed soon thereafter, visiting Eniwetok Atoll along the way to the Marianas. She arrived at Guam on 8 April and stayed there until the 24 April.  Saipan and Okinawa operations  From there she sailed to Saipan and, after about a month of miscellaneous duties there, headed for Okinawa. She spent the next month, 30 May to 30 June, providing smoke screens, carrying troops and supplies, and helping other landing craft retract from the beaches.  End-of-war operations  The conquest of Okinawa was fairly well complete by the end of June, but the LCI(L) continued to operate in that vicinity until 12 September. At that time, she was sent to Japan where she performed a number of duties, including ferrying allied prisoners-of-war to Guam and supporting the occupation forces in the Tokyo area. LCI (L)-1093 departed Japan on 14 April 1946. Sailing via Guam and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Diego on 10 June. By mid-July, she had retransmitted the Panama Canal and had arrived in Boston, Massachusetts. She then decommissioned at Boston and was towed to the berthing area at Hingham, Massachusetts.  Reactivation in 1947  She returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 20 April 1947, and for almost three years, served the 1st Naval District as a U.S. Naval Reserve training ship. In January 1950, she was taken to Charleston, South Carolina, to be inactivated. This time, she was berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida.  Reactivation in 1953 as AMCU-41  In August 1953, she returned to Charleston to be converted to a coastal minesweeper AMCU-41. On 23 January 1954, the ship was commissioned as Skimmer (AMCU-41), Lieutenant W. M. Gattis commanding. She was assigned to the 1st Naval District in late February 1954 and, on 6 March, departed Charleston for Boston. She headed via the Chesapeake Bay, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the East River, Long Island Sound, and the Cape Cod Canal and arrived in Boston on 14 March. She operated in the 1st Naval District for the next year participating in LANTSUBMINEX-54 and LANTFLTEX-55 and representing the 1st Naval District at the Rhode Island State American Legion Convention from 18 to 20 June 1954.  Final deactivation and decommissioning  On 1 March 1955, she commenced Phase Able inactivation at Boston and was redesignated MHC-41. By 20 April, she was back at Charleston, South Carolina, beginning Phase Baker inactivation. Finally, on 1 July 1955, Skimmer decommissioned at Charleston and was berthed there as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In 1958, she was moved to the berthing area at Green Cove Springs, Florida; and, on 1 January 1960, her name was struck from the Navy list.  Military awards and honors  Skimmer (LCI(L)-1093) received one battle star for World War II service.

Variously translated as Eight Pieces of Brocade, Eight-Section Brocade, Eight Silken Movements or Eight Silk Weaving, the name of the form generally refers to how the eight individual movements of the form characterize and impart a silken quality (like that of a piece of brocade) to the body and its energy. The Baduanjin is primarily designated as a form of medical qigong, meant to improve health. This is in contrast to religious or martial forms of qigong. However, this categorization does not preclude the form's use by martial artists as a supplementary exercise, and this practice is frequent. History This exercise is mentioned in several encyclopedias originating from the Song Dynasty. The Pivot of the Way (Dao Shi, c. 1150) describes an archaic form of this qigong. The Ten Compilations on Cultivating Perfection (Xiuzhen shi-shu, c. 1300) features illustrations of all eight movements. The same work assigns the creation of this exercise to two of the Eight Immortals, namely Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin. The exercise was later expanded from eight to twelve movements over the centuries and was described in the boxing manual Illustrated Exposition of Internal Techniques (1882) by Wang Zuyuan, a famed practitioner of the Sinew Changing Classic set. Nineteenth century sources attribute the style to semi-legendary Chinese folk hero General Yue Fei,Shahar, The Shaolin Monastery, p. 168 and describe it as being created as a form of exercise for his soldiers. The legend states he taught the exercise to his men to help keep their bodies strong and well- prepared for battle. Martial historian Prof. Meir Shahar notes Yue's mention as a lineage master in the second preface of the Sinew Changing Classic manual (1624) is the reason why he was attributed as the creator of Baduanjin qigong. The sections The Baduanjin as a whole is broken down into eight separate exercises, each focusing on a different physical area and qi meridian. The Baduanjin traditionally contains both a standing and seated set of eight postures each. In the modern era, the standing version is by far the most widely practiced. The particular order in which the eight pieces are executed sometimes varies, with the following order being the most common. Standing ;Two Hands Hold up the Heavens (Shuang Shou Tuo Tian): This move is said to stimulate the \\"Triple Burner\\" aka \\"Triple Warmer\\" or \\"Triple Heater\\" meridian (Sanjiao). It consists of an upward movement of the hands, which are loosely joined and travel up the center of the body. ;Drawing the Bow to Shoot the Eagle / Hawk / Vulture: While in a lower horse stance, the practitioner imitates the action of drawing a bow to either side. It is said to exercise the waist area, focusing on the kidneys and spleen. ;Separate Heaven and Earth: This resembles a version of the first piece with the hands pressing in opposite directions, one up and one down. A smooth motion in which the hands switch positions is the main action, and it is said to especially stimulate the stomach. ;Wise Owl Gazes Backwards or Look Back: This is a stretch of the neck to the left and the right in an alternating fashion. ;Sway the Head and Shake the Tail: This is said to regulate the function of the heart and lungs. Its primary aim is to remove excess heat (or fire) (xin huo) from the heart. Xin huo is also associated with heart fire in traditional Chinese medicine. In performing this piece, the practitioner squats in a low horse stance, places the hands on thighs with the elbows facing out and twists to glance backwards on each side. ;Two Hands Hold the Feet to Strengthen the Kidneys and Waist: This involves a stretch upwards followed by a forward bend and a holding of the toes. ;Clench the Fists and Glare Fiercely (or Angrily): This resembles the second piece, and is largely a punching movement either to the sides or forward while in horse stance. This, which is the most external of the pieces, is aimed at increasing general vitality and muscular strength. ;Bouncing on the Toes: This is a push upward from the toes with a small rocking motion on landing. The gentle shaking vibrations of this piece is said to \\"smooth out\\" the qi after practice of the preceding seven pieces or, in some systems, this is more specifically to follow Sway the Head and Shake the Tail.

Gaighata block is one of the areas where ground water is affected by arsenic contamination. According to the findings of the Arsenic Dushan Protirodh Committee (ADPC), a national-level NGO which aims to spread awareness of arsenic and prevent arsenic poisoning through water, found at least 70 tube-wells were reportedly supplying water highly contaminated with arsenic. The ADPC tested water from wells across Gaighata block in North 24-Parganas as well as urine samples of 100 school children. The possibility of a low cost river water treatment plant utilizing water from Yamuna- Ichhamati at Gighata has been considered. However, this is not considered feasible because the river is highly polluted, costs would considerably increased because of installation of chemical treatment plant to remove pollutants, and the volume of water in the river in summer season is not sufficient. Project Well, a NGO, is implementing a self-supporting community- based mitigation program in Gaighata to provide arsenic safe water by constructing 20 modified conventional dugwells along with education on water related health effects to change behaviour.

It was engineered by Engesa in response to a perceived Brazilian Army requirement for a light armored car capable of replacing its unarmored utility vehicles in the liaison and security role. The first Jararaca prototype appeared in 1979 and serial production commenced in 1982 after extensive operational testing in Brazil. It was ultimately rejected for large scale service with the Brazilian Army due to concerns over the limited mobility of its four-wheeled chassis but achieved some minor successes on the export market. After the early 1980s, the Jararaca was marketed solely towards potential export customers such as Iraq and Libya, both of which influenced the vehicle's continued development. Nevertheless, much of Engesa's marketing efforts for the Jararaca were stymied by a combination of a trend towards heavier wheeled armored fighting vehicles and a surplus of cheaper light armored cars available to the armies of developing nations, particularly during the final years of the Cold War. Development history By the 1960s and 1970s, most modern armies had recognized a niche for armored vehicles in secondary battlefield tasks, such as providing information and rear security for larger mechanized formations. This trend to \\"mechanize\\" auxiliary land warfare elements placed an emphasis on the use of light armor to fulfill roles outside the traditional armored doctrine of maneuver and combat. The niche the trend created resulted in the development of new vehicles intended to bridge gaps between tanks or tracked armored personnel carriers above the 7 tonne class and jeep type vehicles under 4 tonnes. During the late 1970s, the Brazilian Army was still using a variety of unarmored jeep class vehicles for auxiliary tasks in its mechanized formations. In 1977, Engesa began development work on an armored scout car which it intended to market to the army as a potential replacement for the jeep class. The new vehicle was to be built on an extremely compact, four- wheeled chassis capable of being airdropped and engaging in passive reconnaissance or deception. Ideally, it would also be fitted with a single heavy or general-purpose machine gun for self defense. The first prototypes appeared in 1979 and incorporated as many parts as possible from the army's preexisting fleet of Engesa utility trucks to simplify logistics. Between 1981 and 1982 the prototypes were trialed by army officials as the EE-3 Jararaca. Their response was anything but favorable. The Jararaca was rejected for service due to a combination of mechanical problems—apparently due to engineering flaws which had been overlooked in spite of criticism from its own design team—and its 4X4 configuration, which limited mobility. Nevertheless, Engesa received some interest from potential export customers, ensuring the program remained viable for that market. The Iraqi Army played a major role in creating the economy of scale necessary to push the Jararaca into serial production; in 1981 it ordered 280 from Engesa. Small numbers were subsequently purchased by Gabon, Uruguay, and Ecuador. The Cypriot National Guard, then in the process of a major modernization program amid tensions sparked by the 1983 Northern Cypriot declaration of independence, accounted for the next major order of Jararacas. The Cypriots were not especially interested in the vehicle's utility as a scout car and modified their Jararacas with MILAN anti-tank guided missiles, converting them into tank destroyers used to support the heavier EE-9 Cascavels in their light armored units. Engesa subsequently began fitting all Jararacas with a filtering system designed to enable their crews to operate in a nuclear, chemical, and biological (NBC) warfare environment; this was apparently in response to pressure from another potential export customer, Libya, which had expressed an interest in the vehicle type. Libya later entered into negotiations to purchase 180 Jararacas once it was satisfied the specified alterations had been carried out; however, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) theorized that the vehicles were intended for a third party such as Iran. At the end of the 1980s, Engesa found the Jararaca increasingly non-competitive as it had to compete with a surplus of other light armored vehicles appearing on the international market in the wake of the 1989 Revolutions and the reduction of Cold War tensions. Furthermore, the market was increasingly skewed towards heavier wheeled armored fighting vehicles, which had become more readily available to the armies of developing nations. An unrelated financial crisis forced Engesa to suspend its operations in 1990 and by 1993 production of Jararaca was formally terminated. Service history Iraq deployed its Jararacas during the Iran–Iraq War and the subsequent Gulf War. The Jararaca did not enter service with the reconnaissance platoons of Iraqi armored divisions—a role typically filled by the BRDM-2 and Panhard AML—but was favored by Iraqi infantry divisions which also operated other Engesa vehicles such as the EE-11 Urutu armored personnel carrier. Deploying the Jararaca with units that were equipped primarily with Engesa vehicles also helped simplify logistics and training on the divisional level, a crucial factor in an army which acquired its hardware from as many diverse sources as Iraq. Iran also possessed a fleet of Jararacas during the Iran-Iraq War; it is unclear whether these vehicles were captured from Iraq or acquired from another external supplier. In 1984, when Libya was in negotiations to purchase 180 Jararacas from Engesa, the CIA suspected that the vehicles were actually intended for Iran or a similar third party. Libya did export 130 unidentified armored vehicles of Brazilian origin to Iran at some point prior to 1987. This was not considered a violation of any end-user agreement because Engesa had refused to place restrictive conditions on the resale or transfer of its products purchased by Libya. Although the Brazilian Army had initially rejected the Jararaca for service, it received a number of Engesa's prototypes, pre- production vehicles, and working demonstrators as a result of that company's closure in 1993. Among these was a Jararaca equipped for NBC detection, which was adopted by the 13th Mechanized Cavalry Regiment based in Pirassununga. Description 300px The EE-3 Jararaca's hull is of electro-slag refined steel which provides ballistic protection against artillery fragments and small arms fire. The driving compartment is located in the front of the hull and to the left. It is provided with three periscopes and a single piece hatch cover. Immediately behind the driving compartment is a crew compartment which accommodates up to two additional personnel. One crew member is seated at the right rear, which also doubles as the gunner's station, and the other at the left rear, where most of the vehicle's internal communications equipment is located. The gunner's station is provided with a single 12.7mm Browning M2 heavy machine gun, which could be mounted in a fully enclosed turret or simply on an open ring mount. Various models were proposed which replaced the heavy machine gun mounting with twin general-purpose machine guns, a 20 mm autocannon, a 60 mm gun-mortar, or a bank for launching anti-tank guided missiles. Both crew members have access to roof hatches over their respective seating positions. The crew usually embarks and debarks through a door opening forwards in the right side of the hull. The Jararaca is fitted with a Mercedes-Benz OM 314A, 4-cylinder, turbocharged engine housed at the hull rear. Transmission is manual and consists of a two-speed Clark Model 240 V mechanical gearbox with one reverse and five forward gears. Both the gearbox and the engine type were selected because they were considered \\"off the shelf\\" commercial components also used by the civilian automotive industry in Brazil. Being the first four-wheeled armored vehicle produced by Engesa, the Jararaca lacked the articulated \\"boomerang\\" suspension usually characteristic of that firm's vehicle range. Its front and rear beam axles are fitted with the more conventional semi-elliptical leaf springs, as well as hydraulic shock absorbers. The axles also have hypoid gears. Standard equipment included a central tire pressure regulation system that allowed the driver to adjust the tire pressure depending on the terrain. Tire pressure on roads was typically set at 2.5kg/cm². External The Jararaca resembles both the EE-11 Urutu and the EE-9 Cascavel in that it possesses a sharply sloping glacis plate, which recedes into a horizontal hull roof line. Its headlamps are recessed and the driver's hatch protrudes from the hull roof over the glacis plate. The sides of the hull are vertical with an odd symmetrical sloping plane between the hull sides and roof. Turrets and ring mountings for various forms of armament are always located atop the hull and slightly to the right due to the position of the turret ring. Variants * EE-3 Tank Destroyer: Variant developed for Cyprus which replaces carries a pintle-mounted, single-tube launcher for MILAN anti-tank guided missiles with a range of 2,000 metres. * EE-3 NBC Reconnaissance: Variant which included detection equipment for a wide variety of chemical and biological agents and eliminated the driver's hatch in favor of a slightly raised glacis plate with three vision blocks for maximum situational awareness. Only one prototype was built; it was adopted by the Brazilian Army's 13th Mechanized Cavalry Regiment. A number of other variants were proposed but did not actually reach prototype form, including Jararacas fitted with 20 mm autocannon, twin machine guns, or a 60 mm gun-mortar.

The barrel of a basilisk could weigh up to 4,000 lb (1,800 kg) and could have a calibre of up to 5 inches (13 cm). On average they were around 10 feet long, though some, like Queen Elizabeth's Pocket Pistol, were almost three times that length. The basilisk got its name from the mythological basilisk: a fire-breathing venomous serpent that could cause large-scale destruction and kill its victims with its glance alone. It was thought that the very sight of its 160 lb shot would be enough to scare the enemy to death. In 1588 the Spanish Armada was equipped with many basilisks for their invasion of England with the intent of using them to besiege towns loyal to Elizabeth I. Many of these guns were lost when the ships were wrecked on their return to Spain. Due to its large size, the basilisk fell out of favour of European generals, who preferred lighter, more accurate artillery in the late 16th century. A late example is the Maltese Gun, built in Holland in 1607 and, like many of its contemporaries, fitted with a replacement carriage during the Napoleonic Wars.

He is well known for authoring various military and other international-related works. Coulon ran in a 2007 by-election for the Liberal Party of Canada in which he lost to the New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Thomas Mulcair. Professional and educational background Coulon attended the Université de Montréal and obtained a diploma in political sciences. He later became a columnist and journalist for Montreal newspaper Le Devoir and was in charge of the international news section. He worked as a journalist between 1985 and 1999 and later wrote opinions at La Presse.Jocelyn Coulon He was also director of monthly revue Aéromag from 1981 to 1984. Before entering politics, he was also a researcher on various related international affairs, especially peace operations. He was the director of Francophone Network on Peace Operations of the Centre d'études et de recherches internationales de l'Université de Montréal between 2005 and 2016. Politics In 2007, Coulon entered federal politics when he was handpicked by Liberal leader Stéphane Dion to run as a Liberal candidate for Outremont in a by-election that was held on September 17, 2007. The seat was vacated by former Transportation Minister Jean Lapierre who pursued his career as a political analyst at TVA. Coulon faced former provincial Liberal Environment Minister Thomas Mulcair from the NDP. During his campaign, Coulon criticized the Conservative government of Stephen Harper on the handling of the War in Afghanistan, accusing them of complying with the policy of US President George W. Bush.http://lcn.canoe.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2007/07/20070720-104518.html His nomination was heavily criticized by the B'nai Brith Canada Jewish group which accused him of being anti-American and anti-Israel because of his views on Middle East issues such as the Hamas-Israel-Lebanon conflict. The Quebec- Israel Committee however, stated that B'Nai Brith's statements were exaggerated and that Coulon had every right to be the Liberal candidate. These issues were thought to be important because the Jewish community in Outremont made up 10% of the riding population. While Outremont had been a Liberal stronghold since 1935 (except for the 1988 election), the NDP won their first House of Commons of Canada seat in the province of Quebec since 1990. Coulon received 28.5% of the vote while Mulcair finished with 48.6%. For the most part, the campaign was a tight race between the two candidates, however late polls pointed to an NDP victory, with visits from star party members Ken Dryden and Justin Trudeau unable to regain the lead for the Liberals. A Dion aide blamed the Outremont by-election on several factors, including poor organization, lack of communication, and lack of a clear policy on Quebec, while former MP Jean Lapierre suggested that it was due to Dion's 14% approval rating in the province. The Conservatives focused their attacks on the leadership skills of Dion, who had been campaigning in the riding. In addition, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald reported that unidentified \\"Dion loyalists\\" were accusing Michael Ignatieff supporters of undermining by- election efforts.Coup dur pour Stéphane Dion, Le Devoir, September 18, 2007 Though Ignatieff phoned up Dion to deny the allegations, The Globe and Mail suggested that the report had a negative impact on the Liberals' morale, citing the NDP's widening lead after the article's release. The by-election was seen as a crucial test for Dion's leadership, as the Liberals were attempting to regain popularity in Quebec since the loss during the 2006 federal elections. Between 2016 and 2017, he was a senior political advisor and speechwriter to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Completed in 1857, it is a distinctive Gothic Tudor design of Swedish architect Charles Ulricson. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 as one of the few surviving sites to host one of the famous 1858 Lincoln–Douglas debates. The building underwent a major restoration in the 1930s, which modernized its interior and restored its exterior.. Description and history Old Main is located on the north side of the Knox College campus, south of South Street between Alumni Hall and George Davis Hall. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick with limestone and concrete trim. It is designed in part to resemble England's Hampton Court Palace, with a pair of projecting polygonal towers topped by crenellated parapets flanking its main entrance. The entrance is itself in a projecting section, in a rounded-arch opening set beneath a tall Gothic-arched window. Limestone stringcourses run between the first and second floors, and above the third floor. Old Main was completed in 1857, and is the oldest surviving building on the Knox College campus. It was designed by Charles Ulricson, a Swedish-trained architect working out of Peoria. At the time, the campus included Old Main and two dormitories, neither of which has survived. Old Main housed most of the school's academic functions for many years, including classrooms and a chapel. By the early 1930s it was in deteriorating condition, and underwent a major restoration. The interior was gutted, replaced by a flooring system of steel and concrete, while interior brick and stone were recycled to repair the exterior. Portions of the limestone trim were replaced with cast concrete at this time. In 1969, a tornado took off the belfry and part of the roof; these were rebuilt in the original style. Lincoln-Douglas debate On October 7, 1858, Old Main was the site of the fifth in the celebrated series of debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, then both running for the United States Senate. The debate was conducted on a platform constructed in front of the building, which the debaters reached by climbing through its windows. The college community, founded by abolitionists, strung a banner behind the platform which read \\"Knox College for Lincoln\\". The debate was attended by an crowd estimated at 15,000. The National Historic Landmark designation, made in 1961, includes the college grounds to the east where most of the crowd sat.

Although there are numerous manufacturers of computer cases, they have generally used three thread sizes. The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) originates from the United States, while the ISO metric screw thread is standardized worldwide. In turn, these thread standards define preferred size combinations that are based on generic units—some on the inch and others on the millimetre. The #6-32 UNC screws are often found on 3.5\\" hard disk drives and the case's body to secure the covers. The M3 threaded holes are often found on 5.25\\" optical disc drives, 3.5\\" floppy drives, and 2.5\\" drives. Motherboards and other circuit boards often use a #6-32 UNC standoff. #4-40 UNC thumb screws are often found on the ends of DVI, VGA, serial and parallel connectors. More modern cases from certain manufacturers (Dell, Gateway) and enthusiast cases will lack screws altogether, instead utilizing a tool-less design.  #6-32 UNC screw  The #6-32 UNC screw has a thread pitch of (). The #6-32 UNC is a UTS screw specifying a major thread diameter of which is defined as ; and (threads per inch) which equates to a thread pitch of . The optional UNC specification indicates the standard coarse thread is used which is defined for #6 screws as 32 tpi rendering 'UNC' redundant, however it may be seen when other specifications such as plating or other treatments are also specified. It is by far the most common screw found inside computer cases.Rutter, Daniel Dan's Data - Letters 53, \\"Screwed\\", 2006-02-26 It commonly appears in lengths of () and () or less often (). Non- standard metricized lengths such as are also sometimes encountered. Nearly every brand new computer case comes with a bag of these. They are commonly used for the following purposes, however there are many exceptions: * securing a power supply to the case * securing a 3.5-inch hard disk drive to the case * holding an expansion card in place by its metal slot cover * fastening case components to one another * usually, one or more #6-32 UNC screws hold the main cover on the case They are almost always provided with a #2 Phillips drive. Sometimes a Torx drive is used instead. Both Phillips and Torx patterns may also be combined with a slot for a flat-blade screwdriver. Usually they are provided with a 1/4 in () flanged hex head. Non-standard metricized flanged hex heads can also be encountered. Also common are pan head screws - a low disk with a chamfered outer edge. Because they are used in places where high torque is not required and easy removal and replacement may be desirable (such as on the side panels of the PC case), they are frequently available as thumbscrews with larger, knurled heads that can be removed with one's fingers or tools.  M3 screw  The M3 screw (bottom) has a thread pitch of , which is finer than the pitch of a #6-32 UNC screw (top). The M3 is a metric screw specifying a nominal diameter of ; and standard coarse thread pitch defined as . The M3 is the second most common screw found in PCs. It commonly appears in many lengths from 1 to 20 mm. Nearly every brand-new computer case comes with a bag of these. Notwithstanding many exceptions, they are commonly used for securing the following devices: * 5.25-inch optical disc drives * 2.5-inch hard disks and solid-state drive * 3.5-inch floppy drives M3 screws typically accept a #2 Phillips screwdriver tip.  Motherboard standoff  Various types of motherboard standoffs Most cases use threaded brass standoffs (Jack Screw Standoffs) for attaching the motherboard to the case chassis. Because the case material is usually a conductive metal, attaching the motherboard directly to it can cause a short circuit. Sometimes threaded or snap-lock plastic standoffs are used, which are less secure, but equally useful in a stationary computer. The standoff provides a margin of space between the motherboard and the case to keep the multiple solder points below from grounding and short- circuiting. Usually, the standoff has a #6-32 UNC male thread on one end which screws into a threaded hole in the case or motherboard backplate and a #6-32 UNC female thread in the other end which accepts a screw to retain the motherboard. Less often, the standoff has a female thread in both ends and a second screw is used to attach it to the case. Some standoffs use the M3 female thread (which faces the motherboard) instead of #6-32 UNC, and on a rare occasion a mixture of types can be used in the same case. Version 2.1 of the ATX specification states that the length of standoffs needs to be at least , with their cross sections fitting within square areas centered around each mounting hole on ATX motherboards.  #4-40 UNC thumbscrews  Pairs of #4-40 UNC thumbscrews are used to fasten certain connectors to hardware ports. The screws are typically located on either side of D-subminiature connectors such as on VGA, serial, parallel and legacy game controller ports. They are also more recently used on DVI connectors. The typical length for a #4-40 screw used in PCs is (). Material Steel is by far the most common material used, frequently with a plated or anodized finish. Other materials including brass, aluminum, nylon and various plastics are also used for applications with particular physical or aesthetic requirements. Comparison The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw with a more coarse thread. This makes it more suitable for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength. Its larger size and coarse thread make it easier to work with during assembly, with less risk of cross threading. The integrated flange provides greater holding strength with less risk of pull through. The hex head makes it easier to work with during assembly with powered torque screwdrivers. The M3 is a thinner screw with a finer thread than the #6-32 UNC. This makes it more suitable for fastening into smaller parts and thinner materials requiring good strength in a limited space. Its size and fine thread make it appropriate for applications where a #6-32 UNC would be excessively bulky without providing any other benefits versus the smaller M3.

MacGregor, Map to Ft. Conger and the Schooner A.W. Greely The MacGregor Arctic Expedition was a privately funded expedition which set out to reoccupy Fort Conger, Ellesmere Island, Canada, a site within flying distance of the North Pole. The expedition, which took place from July 1, 1937, to October 3, 1938, had four main objectives: To collect weather data; to make a magnetic survey; to photograph the aurora borealis and study its effects upon radio transmission; and to explore the area northwest of Ellesmere Island, in order to clear up the questions about Crocker Land, which Robert Peary placed on the map more than 30 years earlier. Preparation In the spring of 1937, a three-mast, tern schooner, Donald II, was purchased in Nova Scotia and brought to Port Newark, New Jersey, where new motors were installed and the ship reinforced and reconditioned for the expedition. It was rechristened the Gen. A. W. Greely on May 2, 1937, in honor of Adolphus Greely, leader of the ill-fated Lady Franklin Bay Expedition of 1881 and 1882. All expedition members paid their own way either by supplying necessary equipment or cash. There were originally eleven members of the expedition: Clifford J. MacGregor, meteorologist for the US Weather Bureau; Isaac \\"Ike\\" Schlossbach, \\"second in command\\", navigator and chief airplane pilot, United States Navy (retired); Roy Fitzsimmons, Polar Geophysicist and magnatologist; Robert Danskin, aircraft supplier and geologist; Gerry Sayre, radio engineer and operator; Murray A. Wiener, photographer; John Johnson, cook and mechanic; Paul \\"Fuzzy\\" Furlong, mechanic and dog handler; Francis Lawrence, aerologist and Junior Naval Guard; Robert Inglis, Surveyor and Boy Scout (the youngest member of the crew); and Norman Hortman, pilot (who left en route north at Sydney, Nova Scotia). En route north The expedition set sail from Port Newark, New Jersey, on July 1, 1937. They made two stops in Nova Scotia: Lunenburg to drop off passengers and take on fresh food and supplies; and Sydney to drop off Norm Hortman and a radio technician who had been tuning the radio equipment and to take on coal. They made two scheduled stops in Greenland, one to take on fresh water and food at Fairhaven and another at Idglorssuit, Umank Fjord to pick up dogs and deliver presents to the Eskimo inhabitants. After departing Idgorsuit the ship encountered ice in Baffin Bay. At the lower end of Robertson Channel they were stopped completely by a wall of ice thick. Failing to reach Ft. Conger was a disappointment to MacGregor. Unable to proceed further they tried to seek shelter on Ellesmere Island only to find the entire coast blocked with ice. They then drifted south along the coast of Greenland urgently looking for winter quarters as new ice was already forming and there was a danger of being frozen in. Wintering over in Etah, Greenland Schooner A.W. Greely frozen in Foulke Fiordat near Etah, Greenland, 1938. They arrived at Foulke Fiord, near Etah on August 31, 1937. Before the expedition could get settled on land, they experienced a series of near disasters which almost settled the expedition at the bottom of the sound. The charts of the area showed of water—the ship drew —but much to their surprise they found themselves aground. By unloading some of the supplies they were able to re-float the ship at the next tide. On September 1, 1937, a severe gale blew the ship out to sea, the anchor being unable to hold on the rocky bottom. On the return to Etah, one of the engines backfired, starting a fire aboard ship. There were some anxious moments until the fire was extinguished as there was still gasoline, ammunition and dynamite aboard. After two days they were able to get back to Reindeer Point near Etah, only to find that most of the supplies that they had unloaded earlier to re-float the ship were under water, as a tide ebbed and flowed there. Finally the ship was unloaded, and work started on enlarging a cabin left by the Humphrey Expedition of 1934–35. So confident was MacGregor that his ice-reinforced, wooden-hulled schooner could reach Ft. Conger that he hadn’t bothered to obtain an entry permit from Danish authorities (required for a base camp in Greenland). Shortly after New Years the expedition was visited by the territorial governor, who had traveled overland from Thule, now (Qaanaaq). He had learned of the expedition's presence in Greenland by monitoring their radio broadcasts and instructed them to leave at the earliest opportunity. Accomplishments Ike Schlossbach warming up the Waco, Spring 1938 Hourly weather observations started September 8, 1937, and reports were transmitted daily to the US Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Pilot-balloon observations were made twice daily except during December and January. All observations were continued until the hour of sailing July 7, 1938. MacGregor believed that accurately observing and plotting the development and movement of air masses as they moved across the Arctic would make possible more precise, longer-range Northern Hemispheric weather forecasting. In late 1937 MacGregor, from Etah, Greenland, gave a long-range weather forecast for 1938, based on the observations from his expedition. Two and a half months later, it proved to be amazingly accurate. In February, Eskimos began arriving from the south. Among them was Ootah, who had accompanied Peary in 1909 on the historic first trip to the North Pole. In March, the Haig-Thomas, Wright, Hamilton expedition visited. They shared the hut while charting portions of Ellesmere Island and conducting biological and glaciological studies. In a combined venture, Schlossbach and Wright made a ice cap survey northeast of Etah. It was probably the longest continuous traverse over that region to that time. Paul Furlong and Roy Fitzsimmons trekked across Smith Sound to Cape Sabline, Ellesmere Island to deposit supplies at a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cache site (a request from Charles Camsell the Northwest Territories Commissioner). The MacGregor expedition took with them a 1933 model Waco biplane for surveying and exploration. The aircraft had a single, 210 horsepower (hp), Continental air-cooled rotary engine. Schlossbach flew the Waco four times from Etah marking several memorable aviation accomplishments; the first solo flight over Ellesmere Island; the first landing on Ellesmere Island; and the refuting of Perry’s claim that there was another island northwest of Ellesmere Island. While exploring the coast of Ellesmere Island in 1909, Commodore Robert Peary had sighted a gray shadow on the horizon. Convinced that he had discovered an uncharted island, he christened it Crocker Land. Isaac Schlossbach armed with a sun compass and extra gas, attempted to locate Crocker Land from the air. He crisscrossed the area where Perry had placed Crocker Land. All he saw was ocean; there was no Crocker Land. Voyage home When the ice broke in July 1938, the explorers left Greenland after making a brief stop in Thule to pick up John Johnson, who had been dog sledded there earlier for medical care. The severe winter had damaged the schooner more than had been expected, and an ice jam in Baffin Bay held the ship for weeks, drifting with the ice. Several seams opened up, and constant pumping was required for days before reaching St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, where repairs were made. During the voyage from St. Johns to Newark, off the Grand Banks, on September 21, 1938, they encountered one of the worst hurricanes that had ever moved up the Atlantic Coast. The expedition finally returned to Port Newark on October 4, 1938, having been out fifteen months and four days. Postscript With only ten members and a scant budget, the MacGregor Arctic Expedition could not rival the major undertakings of Byrd or Scott. But it certainly was comparable in size and purpose to many other polar expeditions of its era. Besides its scientific and aviation accomplishments, the 15-month-long MacGregor Arctic Expedition was a valuable experience for several members who would serve again on polar expeditions. Ike Schlossbach would continue to be on expeditions until he was 70 years old; Paul Furlong would be with Grenfell in 1939; Roy Fitzsimmons would go on the United States Antarctic Service Expedition, 1939–41; Murray Wiener would be with Byrd on several expeditions and serve on Byrd's personal staff. > \\"The MacGregor Arctic Expedition had some notable achievements.

He is also well known as a TV actor, novelist, film director, screenwriter and songwriter.  Early life and artistic career  Yukio was born in Nihonbashi ward of Tokyo City in 1932. His father was an entrepreneur who had been running a bento catering business. He began writing manzai comedy while enrolled as a student at Waseda University and made his debut as a comedy writer in Japan's fledgling television industry. He rose to fame as the star of programs such as and . He produced, directed and starred in the film , which was a contestant in the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. His first novel, , won the Naoki Prize in 1981. Aoshima wrote for popular comedian Hitoshi Ueki and was largely responsible for creating Ueki's image. According to Ueki, Aoshima once told him: \\"Don't tell anyone you don't drink, otherwise you'll put me out of a job.\\" Aoshima wrote the hit 1961 song , performed by Hajime Hana and the Crazy Cats, of which Ueki was a member. Aoshima characterized the song as \\"the saga of a happy-go-lucky salaryman who is unable to avoid the temptations of drink and gambling\\" with the resonant lyric \\"I know it's wrong, but I can't give it up.\\" He linked the song to his political views later on, writing that \\"we have spent several decades creating a society and economy oriented towards mass production, mass distribution, mass consumption, and mass waste. We know something is amiss, but we are so caught up in it that we cannot give it up.\\"  Political career =House of Councillors Aoshima was elected to the House of Councillors in the 1968 election as a national block write-in candidate, capitalizing on his fame to win 1.2 million votes and placing second in the block behind Shintaro Ishihara. He refused to give outdoor speeches in the style of other Japanese politicians, but nonetheless remained in the Diet until 1995, when he resigned to run for Governor of Tokyo. He was part of the Dainiin Club, a minor political party composed of independent candidates in the House of Councillors. Governor of Tokyo Aoshima ran for Governor of Tokyo in 1995, without major party support and again without campaigning beyond state-sponsored posters and TV spots. Knock Yokoyama, also a comedian, was elected as governor of Osaka Prefecture in the same election cycle. As governor, Aoshima cancelled a costly \\"World City\\" exposition that Governor Shun'ichi Suzuki planned to have held in Odaiba in 1996, calling it a \\"legacy of the bubble economy era\\". In the wake of this act, which had formed the bulk of the basis for Aoshima's gubernatorial campaign, his administration was viewed as largely ineffective. He resigned after four years in office, by which time he was known as \\"Mr. Broken Manifesto\\". During his tenure as governor, Aoshima became the target of an assassination attempt in May 1995, when a parcel bomb was mailed to his Tokyo office. The bomb, intended for Aoshima, exploded in the face of his assistant, severely wounding him. It is believed that the bomb was mailed by members of the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo. Aum member Naoko Kikuchi was accused of the bombing but was acquitted after a trial in 2015. Aoshima ran for the House of Councillors again in the 2001 election and the 2004 election but failed to win a seat. He died of myelodysplastic syndrome in December 2006 at the age of 74.

He is considered a pioneer in this field and contributed several groundbreaking publications, most notably, the Deutscher Sprachatlas.  Biography  Georg Wenker was born in Düsseldorf on January 25, 1852. He attended gymnasium there and in 1872 received his eligibility to attend college. Beginning the summer semester of 1872, Wenker studied in Zürich, Bonn and Marburg. In 1876, Wenker earned his Ph.D. degree in Tübingen with a dissertation topic on the shifting of German root syllables. In 1877 he took on the position as a librarian at Königlichen Universität Marburg, where he later received an honorary professorship in 1898. In 1886, he was appointed honorary member of the Koninklijke vlaamsche Academie voor taal- en letterkunde. Eventually, the institution became nationalized in 1888 and Wenker became director. He died in 1911.  Contributions and significance Wenker's first effort to map spoken dialect began in 1876 and involved surveying schoolmasters in northern Germany. He sent a list of sentences written in standardized German and requested a transcription into the local dialect. From 1877 until 1887 Wenker successfully surveyed the entire country, and out of 50,000 surveys, 45,000 schoolmasters replied. Each questionnaire contained forty sentences, ranging from simple to somewhat difficult, and offered multiple points from which the local dialect could emerge. The first sentence, for example, was ' In winter the dry leaves fly around through the air. The immense size of the corpus Wenker had before him proved to be a disadvantage. He was therefore confined to analyzing the variation of only a small number of certain words and within a small area as well. Moreover, the difficulty in publishing maps also hindered access to his work. He made two sets of maps by hand and both were published under the title ' The two maps each cover a single feature in north and central Germany. Wenker continued collecting questionnaires after the publication of his atlas, but it took more than forty years for his vision to be realized. In 1926, under the editorship of Ferdinand Wrede, the first volume of the ' was published. Inevitably perhaps, later dialectologists found Wenker's data, which was rich in phonological and word-structure information, to be too limited in terms of lexical and syntactic variants. The project was discontinued in 1956, but resulted in over 16,000 hand-drawn maps, which are currently housed in the atlas archives in Marburg. In spite of the problems experienced by Wenker, his pioneering work nonetheless set the foundation for many successors.  Additional sources  * Chambers, J.K. and Peter Trudgill. 1980. Dialectology.

It is a mystery novel primarily set in the imaginary town of Wrightsville, United States. Plot summary Howard Van Horn, son of millionaire Diedrich Van Horn, comes to Ellery Queen with the request that Ellery investigate what Howard has been doing during a recent bout with amnesia. The trail leads to the small New England town of Wrightsville and what seems to be a love triangle with Howard's stepmother, the beautiful young Sally, from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" in class-conscious Wrightsville. A series of small and unusual crimes over the next nine days seem to be committed by Howard during amnesiac blackouts, and Ellery Queen suddenly realizes the bizarre pattern that underpins the series of crimes. Literary significance & criticism (See Ellery Queen.) After many popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel is the third to take place against the setting of the imaginary New England town of Wrightsville (following Calamity Town and The Murderer is a Fox) and, as is common in the Wrightsville novels, depends more on characterization, atmosphere and the observed minutiae of small-town American life than many other Queen novels; this novel less so, because of the necessity to make characters and events fit into the underlying format. \\"The town with its gossip and cliques is well done ... [one of] the complex and mundane mysteries ... favored by the ingenious authors.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime (revised edition) New York: Harper and Row, 1989 (first published 1971). \\"All Wrightsville murders are well written as more attention is given to character development and humor. The way some Wrightsville stories interlink only adds to the fun ... This is the era wherein Ellery Queen experiments with minimalism as his work is stripped down to its most fundamental features. ... The more fallible side to Ellery is especially emphasized. Nowhere else is the limitation of reason better shown than in Ten Days' Wonder. Ellery went through the turmoil of extreme self-doubt, almost giving up on being a detective ... and another double-twist ending. Brilliant portrayals, be it a little far-fetched.\\"A website on Ellery Queen \\"(Ellery's) exploits took place more frequently in the small town of Wrightsville, where his arrival as a house guest was likely to be the signal for the commission of one or more murders. Very intelligently, Dannay and Lee used this change in locale to loosen the structure of their stories. More emphasis was placed on personal relationships, and less on the details of investigation. ... In later stories, however, fantastic ingenuity takes over at the expense of characterization, as in Ten Days' Wonder ... One can admire the ingenuity, and yet sense that there is something wrong about the way in which Queen is turning back to Van Dine and abandoning the possibilities glimpsed in the first Wrightsville books.\\"Symons, Julian, Bloody Murder (From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History).

On 9 February 1942 the Imperial Japanese Army assaulted the north-western front of the British colony of Singapore. Their primary objective was to secure a second beachhead after their successful assault at Sarimbun Beach on 8 February, in order to breach the Jurong-Kranji defence line as part of their southward thrust towards the heart of Singapore City. Defending the shoreline between the Kranji River and the Johor–Singapore Causeway was the Australian 27th Brigade, led by Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, and one irregular company. On 10 February the Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses while moving up the Kranji River, which caused them to panic and nearly aborted the operation. However, a series of miscommunications and withdrawals by Allied forces in the ensuing battles allowed the Japanese to swiftly gain strategic footholds, which eventually led to the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942.Owen, \\"The Fall of Singapore\\", p. 170. Background The terrain around Kranji was primarily mangrove swamps and tropical forest intersected by streams and inlets. The shoreline between the Kranji River and the Johor–Singapore Causeway, nearly four kilometers long, was defended by the Australian 27th Brigade, led by Australian Brigadier Duncan Maxwell. The 27th Infantry Brigade consisted of three battalions—the 2/30th, 2/29th, and 2/26th and was supported by the 2/10th Field Artillery Regiment, as well as one platoon from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion.Thompson, \\"Phoney Fortress\\", pp. 262–269. They were supported by one company from Dalforce (named after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel John Dalley of the Malayan Police Special Branch),National Heritage Board, \\"Kranji Beach Battle\\", p. 2. a local Chinese militia consisting of Communists, Nationalist supporters, and other volunteers. As the war intensified, the Dalforce volunteers were given only three to four days of training and sent to the war front with elementary weapons.Major Yap, \\"The Northwestern Tour – Kranji River Park\\", p. 38. Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a red triangle on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians. The Allied forces at Kranji were to be assaulted by the Imperial Guards Division led by Major General Takuma Nishimura. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken Pulau Ubin, an island in the north-east of Singapore, in a feint attack on 7 February, where they encountered minimal resistance.Major Yap, \\"Invasion of Singapore\\", p. 14. Battle Causeway (background, centre) was blown up by retreating Allied forces in early February 1942 9 February 1942: Japanese landings On 9 February, two divisions of the IJA Twenty Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the Sarimbun area, where the Battle of Sarimbun Beach took place between predominantly Australian and Japanese troops. Yamashita's headquarters (HQ) was located at the Sultan of Johor's palace at Istana Bukit Serene, which offered him and his subordinate officers a bird's-eye view of virtually every key (both military and civilian) target in the northern part of the main island of Singapore, just only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the Straits of Johor. Sultan Ibrahim's palace was not ordered to be fired upon by British artillery, even when it was clear that the invading Japanese forces had their headquarters there, because any damage caused to the palace would have extensive negative repercussions for ties between Johor's royalty and their British colonial counterparts.Major Yap, \\"Yamashita's Assault Plans\\", p. 14. The primary objective of the Japanese forces landing at Kranji was to capture Kranji Village, thus enabling them to repair the partially-destroyed Causeway in order to facilitate the easy flow of reinforcements and supplies down the roads of Woodlands and Mandai, and to the rest of the island for their vanguard force.Thompson, \\"Death of an Empress\\", pp. 283–284. Once the leading wave of Japanese was safely ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and telephone communications were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the front line and command HQ were broken. At 8:30pm that night, the men of the Imperial Guards Division began the crossing from Johor in special armoured landing-crafts, collapsible boats and by swimming. Shortly after midnight on 9 February, the 2/29th Battalion was detached from the 27th AIF Brigade and sent to defend the western outskirts of Tengah Airfield and subsequently came under the command of the 22nd AIF Brigade. Leaving Maxwell and the 27th Brigade with only two of its three battalions for the upcoming battle and no reserve.\\"2/29th Battalion War Diary December 1941 – February 1942\\", p. 123. 10 February 1942: Heavy losses Australian anti-tank gunners overlooking the Johor Causeway between Singapore and Malaya. The men are manning a 2-pounder anti-tank gun. In the early hours of 10 February, Japanese forces suffered their heaviest losses during the Battle of Singapore. While moving up the Kranji River, advance landing parties from the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard Division found themselves under heavy fire from Australian machine gunners and mortar teams. They also found themselves surrounded by oil slicks, which had been created by Allied personnel emptying the nearby Woodlands oil depot, to prevent its capture. A scenario feared by Yamashita came to pass by accident; the oil was set alight by Allied small arms fire,Based on various references, different account of the event was given on whether the setting of fire to the oil slicks was intentional or accidental. The on-site commemorative monument erected by the National Heritage Board in 1995 reads: \\"They were stuck in the mud and were caught in the oil slicks created by Allied troops releasing oil from the nearby Woodlands depot. The first wave of Japanese troops were burnt when Allied troops set fire to the oil.\\" causing many Japanese soldiers to be burnt alive. Sustaining heavy losses, Nishimura requested permission to abandon the operation. However, Yamashita denied the request. Maxwell, who had limited communications with his division headquarters, was concerned that his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks. Japanese tanks, such as Type 95 Ha-Gos and Type 97 Chi-Has, which were regarded as light and having possessed relatively good buoyancy, were towed by IJA boats and water-craft across the straits towards Lim Chu Kang, where they soon joined the battle at dusk on Lim Chu Kang Road.Bose, \\"The Battlebox and the Malayan Campaign\\", p.100. With reinforced enemy forces and their supporting tanks rapidly advancing down Choa Chua Kang Road, the defending Australian troops were forced to retreat and fled southeast to the hills of Bukit Panjang. The IJA 5th Division captured Bukit Timah Village by the evening of 11 February. =Jurong-Kranji defence line= The present-day Jurong Canal, located along the boundary between Jurong East and Jurong West, formed the Jurong-Kranji defence line during the Battle of Singapore Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, General Officer Commanding of HQ Malaya Command, drew a defence perimeter covering Kallang Airfield, the MacRitchie and Peirce reservoirs and the Bukit Timah supply depot area to ensure the integrity of the city's defence. One line of the north-western defence perimeter was the Jurong-Kranji defence line, a narrow ridge connecting the sources of Sungei Jurong and the Kranji River, forming a natural defence line protecting the north-west approach to the Singapore Town. (Its counterpart was the Serangoon Line, which was sited between Kallang Airfield and Paya Lebar village in the eastern part of Singapore).Thompson, \\"Phoney Fortress\\", p. 262. The troops were to defend this Line strongly against the invading Japanese force. The Line was defended by the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade which covered milestone 12 on Jurong Road, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and the beleaguered 22nd Australian Brigade which guarded the northern part of the Line and maintained contact with the 44th Indian Brigade.National Heritage Board, \\"Jurong-Kranji Defence Line\\", p. 3. The 15th Indian Infantry Brigade was re-positioned near Bukit Timah Road to guard the island's vital food and petrol supplies. A secret instruction to protect this area was issued to Percival's generals. =Miscommunication= Percival's secret orders to withdraw to the last defence line around the city only if necessary were misunderstood by Maxwell, who took this to be an order for an immediate withdrawal to the Line.Elphick, \\"Retreat in the West\\", p. 430. As a result, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Australian Brigade, reinforced after their withdrawal from Sarimbun beach in the north-west, abandoned the Line on 10 February. Fearing that the large supplies depot would fall into Japanese hands should they make a rush for Bukit Timah too soon, General Archibald Wavell, Allied commander-in-chief of the Far East sent an urgent message to Percival: Aftermath Monument erected by the National Heritage Board to mark the historical site of the Battle of Kranji at present-day Kranji Reservoir Park, Singapore By 11 February, the Jurong-Kranji Defence Line was left undefended which allowed the Japanese forces to sweep through the Line to attack Bukit Timah. On the same day, Percival finally moved his Combined Operations Headquarters in Sime Road to the underground bunker, The Battle Box at Fort Canning. Despite their fighting spirit, the Dalforce fighters suffered from poor training and the lack of equipment. A further blow was delivered when the 27th Australian Brigade withdrew southwards. As a result, the Japanese established a stronghold in the northern Woodlands area and secured a relatively easy passage into the island. General Wavell left Singapore for Java early on 11 February and sent a cable to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in London on his assessment of the war front in Singapore: By 12 February, the Imperial Guards had captured the reservoirs and Nee Soon village. The defending troops, by this time, were badly shaken. Thousands of exhausted and frightened stragglers left the fighting to seek shelter in large buildings. On the same night, British forces in the east of the island had begun to withdraw towards the city.Major Yap, \\"Further Retreat of the Defenders\\", p. 19. On 13 February, the Japanese 5th Division continued its advance and reached Adam and Farrer Roads to capture the Sime Road Camp. Yamashita moved his HQ forward to the bomb-damaged Ford Factory in Bukit Timah. Heading southwards, the Japanese 18th Division advanced into Pasir Panjang, where the last major battle of Singapore would be fought with the Malay Regiments at Bukit Chandu.Major Yap, \\"The Pasir Panjang Battle\\", pp. 62–63.

Story The people of Minami-sakōjima Island, isolated far from Honshū Japan, were worrying over how to deal with depopulation. The key industry of this island is the aerospace industry owned by the Demizugawa Heavy Industry. Nevertheless, Demizugawa Heavy Industry decided to close down the factories and laboratories on Minami-sakōjima Island. Takamidsuka senior high school is the only high school on Minami- sakōjima Island. This school has a dormitory named \\"Tsugumi Dormitory\\", which was remodeled from a former schoolhouse. There's a collusive relationship between the principal of Takamidsuka senior high school and a resort development company \\"Rinchu Real-estate\\". Together they contrive to demolish the Tsugumi Dormitory and build a huge resort hotel on the lot. The principal hopes to tie into Rinchu Real-estate's interests. As a result, he decided to stand for the Mayoralty of Minami-sakōjima Town. The principal declares that he will close down the Tsugumi Dormitory if the number of boarders falls below five. Currently there are five boarders in this dormitory: Umi, Naoko, Miyaho, Shizu and Wataru. Next spring, Naoko will enter a University far from the island. Umi, Rinna, Miyaho and Shizu (Their fathers are engineers in Demizugawa) will move from Minami-sakōjima Island as well. Therefore, Tsugumi Dormitory will be closed down and the boarders of Tsugumi Dormitory are destined to separate from each other. Together they spend community life as the last boarders of Tsugumi Dormitory. A transfer student Rinna enters the Tsugumi Dormitory. She behaves disobediently in the school and the dormitory.

It is a ring of yeast-leavened wheat dough, that has been boiled in water for a short time before baking.Savella Stechishin (1989). Traditional Ukrainian Cookery. Trident Press, Canada. ()  Common names and types  A class of such ring-shaped rolls is common for Eastern European cuisines. Ukrainian bublik is similar to an Ashkenazi Jewish bagel, but is somewhat bigger and has a larger hole. Bubliks usually have a denser and \\"chewier\\" texture than bagels. Russian baranka (; pl. baranki) is a dough ring somewhat smaller than a bublik, but also thinner and drier. Sushka (; pl. sushki) is an even smaller and drier type, generally about 5 cm in size, and has the consistency of a hard cracker. In Russian and Ukrainian, bublik is often used as a generic designation for any ring-shaped product of this type. In Russian, baranka is also used as a similar generic term, whereas \\"baranka- type products\\" () is a formal designation of the product class. A cognate term, obarinok (обарінок) or obvarinok (обварінок), is sometimes used as a synonym for bublik or baranka in Ukrainian. () Bublik or baranka is known as abaranak () in Belarusian and or in Lithuanian. Polish obwarzanek is done with the same technology as bublik or baranka, but its most common form, obwarzanek krakowski, has a braided ring shape. File:Bublik in Kiev with Sesame.JPGUkrainian bublik topped with sesame File:Barankas.jpgRussian baranki File:Сушки с маком.JPGSushki topped with poppy seeds Etymology Bublik stems from Old East Slavic бубьлъ (bubl), ultimately from Proto-Slavic *bǫbьlь, from which Polish bąbel, Czech boubel and Slovak bublina also originated. All these words mean \\"bubble\\".Max Vasmer. Russisches etymologisches Wörterbuch. Winter. Heidelberg, 1953–1958 (in German); Бублик (in Russian)Etymological dictionary of Ukrainian language (2003), vol 1, p. 274. (in Ukrainian), Naukova Dumka, Kiev. (4) Russian baranka or baranok is a contraction of the word obvaranok (обваранок), \\"scalded\\" / \\"parboiled\\". Belarusian abaranak, Ukrainian ob[v]arinok and Polish obwarzanek share the same etymology.Max Vasmer. Russisches etymologisches Wörterbuch. Winter. Heidelberg, 1953–1958 (in German); Баранка (in Russian) The Russian spelling suggests that the word was adopted into Russian from Belarusian. History The first known written mention of the bagel is found in the Community Regulations of the city of Kraków in 1610. The bagel spread through Poland across all areas with significant Jewish population, reaching Ukraine, where it got its current form. The word bublik was adopted from Ukrainian to Russian in which it is first documented in the 18th century. It is mentioned as \\"wheat bublik\\" (бублик пшеничнои) in the Lexicon or Alphabetic Collection of Speeches from Russian to Dutch by Jacob Bruce published in 1717 in Saint Petersburg. () Saint Casimir's Fair in Vilnius, 1935 The baranka is first mentioned in Russian sources in a 17th century text. An entry for the year 1665 in the account ledger of Valday Iversky Monastery reads: \\"Baranki and eggs purchased for the brothers in Bogoroditsino village for ten altyn.\\" () In the 19th century, the town of Valday was famous for its baranki.Баранки. In: В. В. Похлёбкин, Кулинарный словарь от А до Я. Москва, Центрполиграф, 2000, (William Pokhlyobkin, Culinary Dictionary. Moscow, Centrpoligraf publishing house, 2000; Russian) Valday baranki were mentioned by Alexander Pushkin, Alexander Radishchev and others. William Pokhlyobkin traces the origin of Russian baranka to what is now Belarus, in particular to the town of Smarhon’ (the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Until they were murdered in the Holocaust, most of the population of Smarhon' was Jewish. Baranki were supposedly used to feed bears in the local school of bear training (the so called \\"Bear Academy\\"). Written accounts of Smarhon' baranki appeared in the 19th century. Adam Kirkor wrote in the encyclopedia Picturesque Russia: \\"In Smorgon', Oshmyany district, Vilna province, almost all the petty bourgeois population is busy baking small bubliki, or kringles, which are widely known as Smorgon' obvaranki. Each traveller would definitely buy several bundles of these bubliki; besides, they are transported to Vilna and other cities.\\" () Władysław Syrokomla mentioned Smarhon' as \\"the capital of obwarzanki famous in all Lithuania\\". Smarhon' obwarzanki were a traditional treat at Saint Casimir's Fair in Vilnius. () Preparation Bubliki and sushki on strings Bubliks are made from yeast-leavened wheat dough that commonly contains milk, butter, and egg whites and is rather sweet. Poppy seeds are a popular addition to the dough, as well as several other fillings. For savory bubliks, sugar is omitted and instead grated cheese and a few drops of onion juice can be added. Bubliks are featured by professional bakers in their shops and at country fairs and regional markets. They are usually strung on a string by the dozen. In Belarus, Russia and Ukraine bubliks and barankas are usually treated not like bread, but like a type of pastry, eaten as a complement to tea or coffee. Therefore, bublik dough is generally sweeter and denser than that of bagel dough, and they are usually glazed with egg yolk. By far the most popular variety of bublik has a liberal amount of poppy seeds added to it. Consumption Cross section of bublik, baranka and sushka Bubliks are usually eaten as is, but it is not uncommon to dip them into tea, a practice that came from eating sushki and baranki, which were very similar in taste, but rather dry and hard and not easily palatable unless moisturized. Another common way of eating bubliks is to break them into several fragments and to eat them with jam (varenye), sour cream (smetana), or other similar dips. While they often accompany tea, bubliks, again unlike modern bagels, are rarely considered a breakfast food. Cultural references Ivan Kulikov, Market with baranki, 1910 A short poem called Protoptala stezhku cherez yar (\\"I beat a path through the ravine\\") in Kobzar book by Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko refers to a young woman who sells bubliki at the market to the Cossacks.Taras Shevchenko (1840). Kobzar. Multiple editions. Bublitchki, a diminutive of bubliki, is a title of a famous Yiddish-Ukrainian-Russian song written in Odessa in the 1920s. Leonid Utyosov popularised the song in the USSR. The Barry Sisters together with the Ziggy Elman Orchestra made it popular in the US in 1939. Today it belongs to the repertoire of klezmer, jazz and pop musicians. A common Russian and Ukrainian phrase is \\"a hole from a bublik\\" (, ) - which means \\"absolutely nothing\\" or \\"worthless\\". Examples: * I worked so hard, and what did I get for it? A hole from a bublik, * He is not worth a hole from a bublik. This expression in literature is found in Mystery- Bouffe, a socialist dramatic play written by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1918/1921: : Someone got a bublik and another one got the hole of the bublik. : So that is to be a democratic republic.

Kazarian ( ; born October 15, 1955) is an American investor, philanthropist, and former investment banker. He is the founder, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Japonica Partners, a private equity hedge fund. Previous to his founding of the firm, he was an investment banker for Goldman Sachs and briefly served as the president and CEO of Sunbeam-Oster from 1990 to 1993 as a corporate raider. He is known for his bidding wars with high net worth individuals and companies to gain assets for his firm, most notably his bidding war against Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) for the acquisition of Borden. Kazarian is seen to be secretive about current or future investment decisions; he opens and closes positions without prior announcement or much after-trade commentary. He is considered by the investment community to be a \\"vulture capitalist\\". Due to its high buy-ins ($250 million), The Hedge Fund Journal called his fund a \\"money manager for money managers\\". During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian become one of the largest bidders for Greek bonds, eventually executing a bond portfolio of €2.9 billion (US$3.8 billion). As the sole owner of the bond position, this portfolio makes up the majority of his overall net worth. On December 11, 2017, it was reported that Kazarian opened an office branch in Lisbon, Portugal tasked with \\"snapping up assets\\" in the country's real estate and technology markets. Early life and education Paul B. Kazarian was born on October 15, 1955, the son of immigrants from Armenia. His grandparents were Charles and Agnes Kazarian; both of them escaped the Armenian genocide. Kazarian grew up in an Armenian community in Pawtucket, Rhode Island–a small mill town— and would go on to name his future investment fund after the street he grew up on: Japonica Street–the name of an Japanese flower. He graduated from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, with a Bachelors of Arts, before attending Brown University to get a master's degree. He went on graduate from Columbia Business School with a M.B.A. During nights at Columbia, he interned at Goldman Sachs, after-which he was offered a full-time position at the firm in their investment banking division. Investment career=Goldman Sachs & Co. In 1984, Kazarian was hired as a full-time investment banker at Goldman Sachs & Co. While at Goldman he worked with multinational investment clients and emerging markets. He often stayed up past 4 AM competing work during his time at the firm. He left Goldman in 1987. Japonica Partners Japonica Partners was formally founded in 1988 in Providence, Rhode Island, by Kazarian. Since its founding, Kazarian has been president and CEO of the firm. In 1993, he founded the Charles & Agnes Kazarian Eternal Foundation, for which he has also been chairman since its inception. Through his earlier years with Japonica, Kazarian oversaw approximately $2 billion in shareholder wealth. The company specializes in under-performing global asset classes and undervalued investment positions. =Sunbeam coup= In 1990, Kazarian, then 37, was asked to serve out a three-year term as chairman and CEO of Sunbeam-Oster, after his private equity firm bought it out in a corporate raid. During his tenure he brought the company back from the verge of bankruptcy and created multiple profit streams for the company, ultimately returning it to profitability. His time as head of the company is used as a case study at Harvard Business School; Steven Fenster, a professor at Harvard University, has been quoted as labeling Kazarian as \\"a mad genius\\" with \\"incredible\\" business acumen. According to an article by The Wall Street Journal, employees at the firm viewed him as an \\"overbearing boss whose frequent harangues and erratic, autocratic behavior made their lives miserable\\". He often called top managers to \\"crisis meetings\\" at late hours in the night and encouraged inter- departmental competition. Top managers at the firm said that they were \\"pitted against one another, publicly hazed, humiliated and even physically intimidated\\". Roderick Hills, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said of Kazarian: \\"as Will Rogers said, no one is quite as good or quite as bad as they're supposed to be.\\" In 1991, he was compensated with $1.84 million. During his tenure he was known to give bonuses to his top managers, sometimes spanning up to 20% of annual pay. Three years later, the board of directors compensated him with a pay package of $2.75 million. However, his management style was viewed as \\"unacceptable\\" in the coming years. Kazarian wanted to move the company headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee because of their relaxed tax structure over Rhode Island–something he began to initiate without the board's approval. The board of directors of the company asked Kazarian to step down as CEO, but after his refusal and attempt to over take executives positions, his employment contract was suspended and eventually terminated. After his was fired, the company's stock dropped by 10% and took four months to recover–however, trading volume for the stock was permanently expanded. Months after his dismissal from the company and return to Japonica, some of his associates at Sunbeam brought multiple lawsuits against him–he won all of them, garnering a total of $160 million in settlements. Greek debt crisis trade After seeing southern European economic decline, he began to look at companies in the area to invest in. On a trip to Greece, he inquired about the government's financial statements; after hearing they did not assemble these statements, he began researching spending and debt ratios of the country. He noticed a difference between the reality of its economy and accounting figures prompting him to begin purchasing government bonds in June 2013 following the country's 2012 legislative elections. Kazarain did not disclose why he was buying these bonds to the Greek government or how much he was purchasing. His initial billion was purchased at 11 cents a bond, eventually concluding at 45 cents. The bonds would go on to be priced at 57/cent a share, marking considerable profit. Although Kazarian would only go on to execute $3.8 billion in bonds, he has insinuated that he has nearly $4 billion in his aggregate bond portfolio. During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian become one of the largest bidders for Greek government bonds, eventually offering a bond portfolio of €2.9 billion euros (approximately $3.8 billion U.S. dollars). His offering was largely ignored by financial analysts and economists who labeled his trade \\"risky and volatile.\\" The government agreed to execute the trade at market price and purchased his partial bond portfolio. During the crisis he met with \\"Greek finance ministers in Athens, top policy makers in Berlin, officials at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and economists at the International Monetary Fund in Washington,\\" according to The New York Times.  Investment philosophy  He is considered by the investment community to be a \\"vulture capitalist\\". He is known for buying out, taking over, or taking a position in distressed companies that face serious financial uncertainty–in an effort to buy at a discount–eventually making them profitable before selling. Due to its high buy-ins ($250 million), The Hedge Fund Journal called his fund a \\"money manager for money managers\\". During his Greek bond trade, he mentioned the accounting strategy he used to force the bond value rise. He said that there is an international standard for accounting that is not used by the European Union, instead opting for a legal framework that distorts the eurozone's financial positions–meant for legal compliance not accountability. The conflation of \\"future value\\" as \\"present value\\" lead Kazarian to begin initiating his trade. He does not disclose specific investment positions or strategies to protect long-term deals and trades. Personal life He resides in a home in Providence, Rhode Island. Kazarian is known for his \\"round, horn- rimmed glasses\\" that have become his \\"trademark\\". On October 6, 2016, The Accountant, the International Accounting Bulletin, and Timetric granted Kazarian the special editors' award of global accountancy magazines for his contribution to strengthening democracy through government financial management. Kazarian has guest-lectured and spoken on the topics of business and philanthropy in settings ranging from the Harvard Business School, London Business School, Columbia Business School, and Dartmouth's Tuck Business School, to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the National School of Development at Peking University. Political and economic views  Although Kazarian has not disclosed his own political affiliations, he has publicly commented on numerous issues. Views on Greek financial stability After his $3 billion government-debt rate he has commented on the need for financial and economic reform in Greece following the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis. He has called for the country to appoint a \\"five-star finance minister\\" with \\"international-caliber five-star specialist training and capabilities to build trust and credibility.\\" Kazarian has called for the country to adopt Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), when the Greek debt structure reaches 18% of GDP. Views on Greek debt He is an ardent supporter of the financial system of Greece. Often asserting that the country's debt is much lower than official reporting discloses, he notes government bonds as being profitable—contrary to reports by the Bloomberg's World Bond Index. He has often stated that \\"the method by which Greece’s debt is calculated in the Eurozone is determined by the Maastricht Treaty and can change only with a unanimous decision by the European Council.\\"–leading to inflated or inaccurate net positions of countries. In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, he voiced his problem with nearly $19 billion being issued in debt-forgiveness for Greece but their debt ratings remaining the same. He believes that \\"the Greek debt should be measured not at face value, which is 312 billion euros in 2015, but on a time of repayment basis, which would bring a substantial write-off due to low interest rates and the fact that its repayment will start in 10 years.\\" Mario Draghi Kazarian has mentioned that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, faces too much pressure from \\"the inaction and inability of politicians\\" which minimizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the eurozone. He asserts the numerous \\"badly managed\\" European governments have rendered the office of the E.U. Central Bank politically pressured. His critique of Draghi's choice to lower zone interest rates was met with some controversy. Wealth and philanthropy During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian made an official public offer to the government of Greece of a bond portfolio of 2.9 billion euros (approximately US$3.8 billion), and the government agreed to execute the trade, paying Kazarian full market price for his bonds. Many financial analysts speculate that Kazarian still has considerable holdings in Greek debt. As of December 2016, his net worth is between $4 billion and $4.1 billion. In 1993, Kazarian established two non-profit foundations whose charitable missions include economic development, education, and technology. The first, the Charles & Agnes Kazarian Eternal Foundation (CAKE) is named in honor of his grandparents. The CAKE Foundation seeks to \\"empower families through economic development, education, and healthcare\\". The second, The Kazarian Foundation, furthers similar goals. It announced a Knowledge Partnership with American India Foundation as part of a Knowledge Partnership initiative. Kazarian was also committee chairman for a 2010 Singapore Heritage Celebration and on January 10, 2011, Kazarian delivered the opening address for a Knowledge Partnership for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Singapore Cooperation Programme. Kazarian is involved with the Asia Society, for which co-chaired the 2011 Awards Dinner. He also chaired the American India Foundation’s fifth annual Spring Awards Gala on April 30, 2008 in New York City.

It is a mystery novel set in New York City, United States. Plot summary A strangler is killing Manhattanites, seemingly at random. The only common thread is the unusual silk cords that are used for the killings; blue for men and pink for women. Other than that, the victims come from all social classes and backgrounds, ethnicities, races, neighbourhoods, etc. The city is in a panic. Ellery Queen forms together a small group of people related to some of the victims, and some consultants, and works to determine the killer's reason for selecting these particular victims. When he finally realizes the thread that connects the victims, the murderer is revealed and peace returns to the city. Literary significance and criticism After many popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel is an early and unusual example of what has become known as a serial killer novel, but before the term \\"serial killer\\" was coined and before criminals such as the \\"Boston Strangler\\" came to the attention of the American public. (The phrase \\"multiple murderer\\" is used in this novel as a synonym for \\"serial killer\\".) Considerable time is spent describing the reaction of the city at large to the events of the novel, almost as if Manhattan itself were a character, and the novel employs narrative techniques unusual for Ellery Queen specifically and for mystery novels in general, such as extensive quoting of (imaginary) newspaper reports and an afterword that is \\"A Note on Names\\". \\"A departure for EQ: more of a manhunt than a mystery, although with a neat twist. [And] there's that extraordinary sequence with Ellery and the psychiatrist.\\"Ellery Queen: A Website on Detection A simplified version of this novel was made into a 1971 TV pilot film titled Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You.

Galarraga made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Texas Rangers on September 15, 2007. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers at the end of the 2007 season where he spent three seasons and also played in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks and Houston Astros. In 2010, he pitched a perfect game which was spoiled when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call on what should have been the 27th and final out of the game at first base. Playing career=Texas Rangers He originally signed as a free agent with the Montreal Expos on October 31, 1998. He was acquired by the Texas Rangers from the Washington Nationals as part of the deal that sent Alfonso Soriano to the Nationals in 2005. Galarraga made his Major League debut on September 15, 2007 against the Oakland Athletics. He entered the game in the eighth inning, and pitched a scoreless inning. He allowed no hits and one base on balls. Detroit Tigers2008= Galarraga pitching in June 2008 On February 5, 2008, Galarraga was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Michael Hernandez, an outfielder that had spent the last season playing for the AA Erie SeaWolves. As a minor league call up for the injured Dontrelle Willis, Galarraga earned his first career win April 16, 2008 in a 13–2 victory over the Cleveland Indians. On June 13, 2008, Galarraga pitched seven shutout innings in a 5–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished the 2008 campaign with a 13–7 record, a 3.73 earned run average (ERA), and 126 strikeouts in 178 innings. When batters did hit the ball against him, they only managed a .237 batting average on balls in play, the lowest in the Major Leagues. Galarraga threw sliders 38.9% of the time in 2008, more than any other starting pitcher in the majors. After a superb rookie season, Galarraga finished fourth in the balloting for the 2008 American League Rookie of the Year Award. =2009= On April 10, 2009, Galarraga pitched the home opener at Comerica Park. Tigers manager Jim Leyland said Galarraga deserved to pitch Opening Day after having an impressive 2008 season. The Tigers won the game 15–2, which included a grand slam by Miguel Cabrera. On April 29, prior to a game against the New York Yankees, Galarraga received his 2008 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association. Statistically, Galarraga did not approach the success he achieved in the 2008 season. His 2009 ERA was a below average 5.64, and opposing batters hit a high .284 against him. =2010= Galarraga pitching in July 2010 In seven innings of work in spring training of 2010, Galarraga allowed nine runs, 14 hits and seven walks. That, coupled with his attitude (\\"They've seen my stuff; they know what I can do\\", Galarraga said during his ineffective spring training stint), prompted the Tigers to option him to the Tigers Triple-A affiliate Toledo on March 18, 2010. Galarraga was called up to the Tigers in May 2010 and was put into the starting rotation. He had an ERA of 4.50 as of June 1. Galarraga was optioned to Toledo on July 6, 2010 but Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski has said he would return on July 20 and start against Texas. On July 19, the Tigers recalled Galarraga. =\\"The 28-out perfect game\\"= On June 2, 2010, Galarraga pitched 8 perfect innings, but the perfect game disappeared on the 27th batter after what was ruled an infield hit. Rookie Jason Donald hit a ground ball to first baseman Miguel Cabrera, who tossed to Galarraga—who was covering first base—but first base umpire Jim Joyce incorrectly called Donald safe, ending the perfect game and no-hitter. Galarraga retired the next batter, completing the one-hitter, though many in the Tiger press preferred to call it \\"the 28-out perfect game.\\" Galarraga threw 88 pitches, 67 of them for strikes. If he had completed the perfect game (83 pitches), it would have been the lowest number of pitches thrown since Addie Joss's 74 in 1908, and the shortest game since Sandy Koufaxs perfect game in 1965. It would have been the second perfect game in the Major Leagues in just four days, Philadelphia's Roy Halladay having thrown his on May 29, and the third in 24 days (Dallas Braden of Oakland on May 9). Joyce later issued a direct apology to Galarraga, saying that the call was incorrect. Galarraga accepted the mistake gracefully, saying later, \\"Nobody's perfect.\\" Observers pointed to the handling of the situation as an example of good sportsmanship on both sides. He was presented with a \\"Medal of Reasonableness\\" for his reasoned response to Joyce's call at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. Arizona Diamondbacks During the 2010–11 offseason, Galarraga was designated for assignment by the Tigers. On January 24, 2011 he was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for pitchers Kevin Eichhorn and Ryan Robowski. On May 17, 2011, Galarraga was designated for assignment and spent the rest of the season with the AAA Reno Aces After the 2011 season, he became a free agent. Baltimore Orioles Galarraga signed as a minor league free agent with the Baltimore Orioles on January 18, 2012. The Orioles released him on April 6. Houston Astros He signed a minor league contract as a free agent with the Houston Astros on May 21, 2012. He pitched in five games for the Astros between July 28 and August 19, losing four of them. Galarraga was designated for assignment on August 22 and released on August 25, 2012. Cincinnati Reds Galarraga signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds in January 2013. Colorado Rockies He was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Parker Frazier on July 15, 2013. He was assigned to AAA affiliate Sky Sox. Texas Rangers In January 2014, Galarraga joined the Texas Rangers on a minor league deal. He was released on March 24. Chinatrust Brother Elephants Galarraga signed a contract with the Chinatrust Brother Elephants of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League in April 2014. He pitched 10 games and posted an ERA of 4.470. He was released by the club on July 5, 2014. Pericos de Puebla In 2015, Galarraga signed a contract with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League.

Bertie was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, from which he took a BA in 1685, and trained a company of volunteers of foot from among the Oxford scholars to support James II during the Monmouth Rebellion. During the Glorious Revolution, however, he joined his uncle, the Earl of Danby, in raising support for William of Orange in the North of England. By 1691, he had been appointed a Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber to Queen Mary, an office he held until her death in 1694. While he was passed over as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 1692 in favor of his elder brother Peregrine, he was appointed Auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall that year as a reward for his services. In 1693, he considered entering a by-election for Clitheroe in Lancashire, where his brother Lord Willoughby was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but ultimately declined, considering his interest there to be insufficient. The following year, on the advice of his uncle Peregrine, he stood for Stamford and was returned along with his uncle Charles. In the House of Commons, he seems to have followed his family in becoming part of the Tory faction of his uncle Danby (now Duke of Leeds). Bertie opposed the attainder of Sir John Fenwick in 1697; however, he escaped dismissal from his auditorship when other members of the family were put out of office that year. He declined to stand for Stamford in 1698, the Berties having agreed with the other county family, the Cecils, henceforth to share the seat; his uncle Charles continued as MP. He may have been the \\"Bertie\\" who contested Liskeard that year, but stood fourth in the poll. In 1699, he was successfully sued in the Court of King's Bench by Sir Philips Coote for having an affair with Coote's wife, Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of William Brabazon, 3rd Earl of Meath. He unsuccessfully contested Mitchell in December 1701, on the strength of his auditorship. In 1704, he was replaced as auditor by his brother Albemarle, a Whig. Bertie's salary as a Gentleman Usher had been converted to a pension upon the death of Queen Mary, but he found it increasingly difficult to collect under the Whig administration, and was forced to appeal to Lord Oxford, the Treasurer, for assistance. During the same year, Bertie unsuccessfully contested a by-election at Boston to succeed his brother Peregrine. While his appeal on petition to the elections committee of the House of Commons was upheld, the House held that the interference of his eldest brother, the Earl of Lindsey and Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, had voided the election, and he again lost the subsequent by-election. Once more he petitioned; the committee declared neither elected, but the House upheld the election of his opponent, William Cotesworth. Bertie married Lady Elizabeth, for some time the object of his affections, in 1711, but had no issue by her. Upon his death in 1728, he left an estate in Liverpool to his brother Albemarle, and lands in Lincolnshire and Somerset and an interest in Sir Cleave More's waterworks at Bootle to charity.

He was one of the founders in 1983 of the Motherland Party (ANAP) led by Turgut Özal, and later a minister in Özal's government. He died in a car accident in 1993 which some considered suspicious, shortly before Özal himself died of an apparent heart attack, a death which some also considered suspicious. Prior to his political career in Turkey, Kahveci had led a successful career as an electrical engineer and academic in the United States, having done his studies in Purdue University and having risen to become a professor at the University of Missouri. Background He was born in Sürmene, Trabzon Province in 1949. Adnan Kahveci was recognized very early as a child prodigy, having come first in a nationwide exam organized by the newspaper Milliyet among primary school students in 1961, in the entry exams for the select Kabataş High School in 1966, in another nationwide exam organized this time by the newspaper Hürriyet and among high school students, in the nationwide university entry exams in 1966 and in Istanbul University scholarship exams. He pursued his studies in electrical engineering in Purdue University in the United States and obtained his doctorate from University of Missouri where he went on to become a professor. After his return to Turkey, he was, for a time in the academic staff of Boğaziçi University. Political career In the early 1980s Kahveci was \\"chef de cabinet\\" (chief of staff) to Prime Minister Turgut Özal, becoming, in the words of The Independent, \\"the main link between Ozal and the outside world, including local politicians and civil servants, the military, as well as Western journalists and foreign investors.\\"The Independent, 9 February 1993, Obituary: Adnan Kahveci When Özal broke with the military in 1982, Kahveci supported his creation of the ANAP (Motherland Party), and would have stood in the 1983 elections if he had not been banned by the military. He became Özal's chief advisor, and entered Parliament in the 1987 elections. He then served for three terms, and was Minister of State responsible, notably, for the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) as well as Minister of Finance (1990 - 1991). Under his tenure, TRT slowly and through equivocal means ceased to be the single TV network in Turkey's media, as private networks were increasingly tolerated and then legalised. As minister and previously advisor to Özal, Kahveci played a catalytic role in many of the key steps taken by ANAP in the eighties, including shaping Turkey's first privatisations. He also followed up allegations of corruption, arranging for a minister who had accepted a pay-off for contracting a shipment of oil to be taped during the conversation on the transaction, and bringing the recording to Özal. Both in office and during the short subsequent period he spent as a member of the opposition after the 1991 elections, he was widely recognized as a maverick deputy, who spoke his mind irrespective of the party line. Prior to his death, Kahveci was working with Özal on the Kurdish question, and wrote a report urging a peaceful solution, including recognition of the Kurdish language.Today's Zaman, 13 December 2011, Interrogations continue on ’90s extrajudicial killings According to the autobiography of Sakıp Sabancı, Özal had also entrusted Kahveci with the issue of potentially reserving seats in Parliament for minorities (an idea Sabancı had urged Özal to take up).Rıfat N.

Known for creativity and inventiveness, frequently he is described as leading Latin America's avant-garde. He is also a pianist, conductor, and researcher.  Biography  Oscar Edelstein Edelstein was born in La Paz, Argentina in the province of Entre Ríos. He spent his childhood in Paraná, Entre Rios's capital, a city known for its river Paraná, South America's second-longest river, and its name is drawn from the Tupi language, meaning \\"like the sea\\" due to its width. Entre Rios is literally the province \\"between rivers\\" (entre = \\"inter\\") and for a short time it was an independent republic – a spirit it has maintained to this day and that has influenced Edelstein. Edelstein is from a family of musicians but his father, a road engineer, inspired him also with a love of machines and technology. He triggered Edelstein's desire to compose by a birthday present at the age of five of a Geloso portable tape recorder. It was his first instrument and tool for composition before the piano. His early interest in creating music was not easy for many of his schoolteachers to understand. To them, all the important composers were dead, therefore it was up to Edelstein to prove that this was not true. Discovering information about living composers while living in a small province was not straightforward and required Edelstein's insatiable curiosity and persistent questioning. He was fortunate to have the imagination and open-mindedness of many of his family and teachers who brought some of the answers he needed. One piano teacher, Eva Taubas, was significant for allowing him at seven to \\"improvise Beethoven\\" in his lessons, in a sense showing him it was possible, as Edelstein puts it, \\"to destroy Beethoven\\" and construct something new. Piano – Bed or Ship? At twelve, his aunt, the well-known Argentine pianist Sara Zimerman, played him a Vladimir Horowitz recording, hoping to encourage him to be a classic concert pianist but in fact she gave Edelstein the big argument he needed to define his future. He remembers saying, \\"He has said all that you can say in this language so let me try something different.\\" He had a special relationship with the piano and his desire was to be another kind of player, seeing that the piano could either be a bed or a ship. Speaking with God One music theory teacher from Paraná would take Edelstein with him to Santa Fe Conservatoire, at the age of eleven, to try to begin his study of harmony and counterpoint as an unofficial student. The teacher told his mother, \\"Oscar is unusually gifted but he really needs to be better at following the rules.\\" His mother looked at Oscar in agreement, however when the teacher continued with advice about how the young Edelstein would also need to follow the rules more strictly in order to make his own musical experience, his mother looked at the teacher and said, \\"You are the professor, but he is the music.\\" This kind of environment gave Edelstein the conviction that he could be the creative source, something he still respects to this day whenever he teaches. Edelstein was also encouraged by a provocative \\"anarchist\\" uncle who told him, \\"You can believe in God if you want, but look at the priests and the rabbis, look at their faces and tell me, if God existed and was intelligent would he really need to choose this face to speak to you?\\" Edelstein took the underlying message of all these experiences to mean that he could be the source of the music, and therefore in his searches to become a composer he needed to link directly to composers, authors and artists. With this in mind he began his lifetime search for originality that fuelled years of intense private study. El Rio, Juan L. Ortiz and interference Sitting by the river listening to a Motorola Transoceanic Radio, as a young boy, he continued to seek out \\"living composers.\\" There was Argentina's national radio station broadcasting concerts from Teatro Colón far away in Buenos Aires, stations from the BBC World Service, from Japan, and all over the world; and when asked by students, at a master class in London and in Birmingham in 2007, how a person from such a small town could become interested in contemporary music, he told a story that he has often told, describing how sitting listening to the radio in a car at night, with the rain, and a storm, and the sound of the river, he never quite knew what was the music and what was the interference. Still asking difficult questions that were difficult to answer, Edelstein discovered Juan Laurentino Ortiz, Argentina's poet most highly respected by other writers, artists and musicians who spent the last years of his life in Paraná. Juan L. Ortiz was to profoundly influence Edelstein, and through many hours sat by the river talking, became a mentor and guide, for it was only he that had the connection to a world of literature, music and culture that could begin to answer Edelstein's intense curiosity. Many intellectuals, young people and important cultures figures came to visit Ortiz, so when he discovered news of Stockhausen he shared it with Edelstein, as well as introducing him to other great works of culture. At thirteen Edelstein went with Ortiz and some other boys on the long trip to Buenos Aires, taking the boat that crossed the river Paraná before the tunnel was built, to Teatro San Martin to see a work of John Cage and Merce Cunningham. Both the experience and the memory of it are like an extraordinary dream where Edelstein remembers dancers with mirrors, intense conversation with Ortiz, and the cultural thrill of being in Buenos Aires for the first time. Edelstein says that the sensation of being in the house of Ortiz was like being in another river, with incredible labyrinthic connections to the whole world through time and space. It was as if Ortiz had tunnels across the world, including to Mao Zedong and Chu En-Lai in Peking − who Ortiz visited in 1957 − and to authors like Jorge Luis Borges, Macedonio Fernandez, and Juan Jose Saer who all visited Ortiz in Paraná.Edelstein remembers other friends that were also with him in the house of Ortiz, such as Sergio Gasparin, Gustavo Aranda, Luis Bourdin, Walter Heinze, Eduardo Isaac and many others. Buenos Aires: The Paradox In 1972 it was with Ortiz' influence that Edelstein made the step of moving to the capital to study. He arrived in Buenos Aires with a recommendation from Ortiz to study with Juan Carlos Paz but Paz died days before he arrived (a story that Edelstein pays tribute to in his work \\"El Hecho\\"Monjeau, Federico Una mirada a los papeles del maestro Suplemento Cultura del diario La Razon. 1985) . Edelstein stayed in Buenos Aires and it was paradoxically only many years later in 1979, that he connected with Francisco Kröpfl, considered the best disciple of Paz. With him he finally completed his study of composition by being given the most important tool – the mastery and control of pitch. This completed Edelstein's appreciation of the universe of Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Vienna School − a world which Paz had introduced to Spanish speaking countries. His other teachers, before Kröpfl, were the prominent Argentine composers from a different aesthetic and school, Mariano Etkin and José Maranzano. Later during the most turbulent years of the period of Argentina's \\"Dirty War\\" (1976–78), Edelstein left the country and spent nearly three years traveling and studying. His travels included two years in France, staying near Paris and also going to the Abbaye de Solesmes, visiting libraries, museums and monasteries to understand more about medieval music. Career: revisioning and creating from nothing=Creating centres, reviews and ensembles Edelstein's career as a composer has been characterised by breaking new ground. He directs many chamber groups of improvisation in music, frequently exploring the interplay between music and theatre, and has attained several national and international awards for his chamber and electronic productions. He is known for his technical mastery of composition, his original methods of composition and direction of improvisation, and his librettos. As a young leading Argentine composer, he was left with a strong impression from many of the principal composers that he met, such as Pierre Boulez, Mauricio Kagel, György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Mario Davidovsky, and John Chowning. He has also helped to introduce many composers from around the world to Argentina, including Francisco Guerrero from Spain (1951–1997). However it was with Luigi Nono, who visited Buenos Aires in 1985, that there was a special and shared sense of understanding. Centro de Investigación Musical Between 1974 and 1977, Edelstein was a scholarship holder at the Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencia, Material, Arte y Tecnología (C.I.C.M.A.T – the former Instituto Di Tella), and between 1985 and 1986 he was one of the three young musicians selected to work at the Laboratorio de Investigación y Producción Musical (L.I.P.M.) It was here that he composed one of the works for which he is most known, Viril Occidente I. Another project of Edelstein's in L.I.P.M. was Estudio y Aplicación de los medios digitales en la Composición Musical (1989–1991), supported by a scholarship of the Fundación Antorchas, and used by Edelstein to compose Viril Occidente II (the overture to El Telescopio). Edelstein also held a scholarship in Science and Technology from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) to work on several different projects related to music analysis and production with computers at the Centro de Investigación Musical (CIM-UBA), in the University of Buenos Aires. This centre was founded and directed by Edelstein, from 1985–1992, working with a team of professors; Pablo Di Liscia, Daniel Montes, Horacio Gutman, and Pablo Cetta. The CIM was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence as applied to music analysis, and the projects they developed were the first to be formally registered in Argentina. Nueva Música, Otras Música, Antorchas' & Lulú Edelstein was also a member of Nueva Música, the group of composers and teachers founded by Paz and continued by Kröpfl, until four years later in 1984, when Edelstein decided to create a new group with eleven composers of his generation, all from different schools and aesthetics, called Otras Músicas. As an association of composers, Otras Músicas was dedicated to the diffusion of contemporary music in the continent. In 1991, he continued his efforts to develop Argentina's infrastructure for disseminating ideas and theories of contemporary music in Argentina, by co-founding and editing a specialist music magazine, Lulú: Revista de Teorías y Técnicas Musicales with Carla Fonseca and Federico Monjeau. It was the first journal in Latin America to be dedicated to the contemporary arts and in the editorial committee were Argentina's most important composers, musicologists, painters and writers. In 1992 Edelstein was the youngest artist to win Argentina's prestigious award of the Antorchas' Scholarship for Outstanding Artists of the Intermediate Generation which he used to compose his opera El Telescopio.Monjeau, Federico De la electroacústica a la ópera Clarin Página 10. 20 Sept 1992 Music for Theatre Throughout his career he has had close links with theatre, and is famous for his collaborations with the renowned Argentine theatre director, Roberto Villanueva, working with him on over twenty productionsIncluding the productions Tabori: Las Variaciones Golberg (2003), Albee: El Juego del Bebé (2001), Estrázulas: Borges & Perón (1998), Handke: Las personas no razonables están en vías de extinción (1997), Discépolo: Amanda y Eduardo (1997), Gallípoli: Botánico (1997) and many others. in the major theatres of Buenos Aires. Several directors in Brazil like Ge Orthof, Hugo Rodas, Fernando Villar, Silvia Davini and many others, have both staged and re-staged works of acoustic theatre by Edelstein. Edelstein has also made many works that have been used in dance, and is noted for his collaborations with the choreographer and director, Silvia Pritz.Including Insanas (2006) piano, female voice and electronic sound /...Hasta dónde??!! (2002) electro acoustic composition, El tigre ciego based on Borges' poem El tigrero Simón Carbajal /Temblor de Fe (2001) electronic music / Tangos Científicos (1989) string orchestra, bandoneón & piano Teaching Edelstein is senior professor and co-founder of the degree in Music Composition in Acoustic and Electro Acoustics, at the University of Quilmes (outside Buenos Aires, see Quilmes). It is a course prominent both in Argentina and throughout the continent. As well as teaching composition for acoustic and electro-acoustic music. The course has over 500 students and many of his alumni have continued as musicians and composers in avant-garde contemporary music, and also in jazz, popular and folk music, as well as holding positions in universities around the world. Having always chosen to be an Argentine composer living in Argentina, it was only in 2007 that he made the step of introducing his work outside Latin America, by making a research trip to give concerts and master-classes in the UK. Approaches to Style: Metaphysical Musical Experiences=Velorio del Angelito Edelstein quotes two key metaphysical musical experiences that influence his style the most; the first was at the age of six at the funeral of a child – called by the people of the province, a \\"velorio del angelito\\" (funeral of a little angel)A ritual common in Santiago del Estero (Northern Argentina) but also sometimes taking place in Corrientes and Entre Rios because, they say, when a child dies that God must have made a mistake – giving an angel to the earth which he needs to take back. Listening to this ritual at the border between the provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes, with the different kinds of groups all playing at the same time, and the Argentine rhythms of chamamé, polka, vals criollo, cumbia, chacarera, milonga and many others, mixing together, and added to by the \\"lloronas\\" hired to cry, was like a strange nightmare or a fantastic carnival that he always returns to in his compositions trying to revisit and rewrite.Monjeau described Viril Occidente I as a \\"fantastic carnival.\\" (1986) The second experience was at the age of around fourteen, when he first heard Stockhausen. Edelstein says, \\"All my life I have been trying to cover this kind of distance.\\"Solare, Juan Maria Oscar Edelstein, el hallador afortunado Interview realised in collaboration with Orlando Musumeci and Favio Shifres en BS AS en septiembre de 1997, publicada en \\"Orpheotron\\" no. 2, December 1997 In an interview he noted, \\"This kind of contradiction between the tragedy, the fiesta and the glory is the representation of the essential spirit of Argentina's story, also epitomized by our national heroes like, Eva Peron, Che Guevara, Carlos Gardel, and Diego Maradona.\\" What is different in Edelstein is his strong opposition to some nationalist academic folcloristas from Argentina, and also for some pseudo popular-folkloric musicians (who as he has pointed out only can understand these experiences in the European style – like tourists in their own land - and they make \\"folclore a la húngara\\" (Hungarian mode)).Fischerman Diego No se puede dejar de lado lo que golpea el alma: Oscar Edelstein y el Ensamble del Sur cerrarán Sonidos en el espacio, el ciclo de música electroacústica que empieza hoy Pagina 12 27 Aug 2004 They look at Argentine popular folkloric music like someone looking at something through a window, or as Edelstein frequently says, \\"Like someone with a hooped-skirt in their brain.\\" In his experience of the \\"velorio del angelito\\" he heard and absorbed the whole experience in all its emotional intensity – \\"I am a popular musician who has studied\\" – something which now gives him the ability to create space and textures in his complex musical language whilst retaining a strong connection with the impulse and imagination of the popular. In this way he contributes to the increase of the stature and imagination of Argentine music, but more in the line of Heitor Villa-Lobos (Brazil) where he says that \\"the folkloric is me\\" – just as Borges \\"enhanced\\" the story of the orilleros and gauchos. Alongside these experiences the effect of a childhood spent close to a powerful river, in the province \\"between rivers,\\" can also be said to have had a profound influence on his music, especially as Ortiz guided him to begin his study of art by first studying nature, including giving him Maurice Maeterlinck's books about bees and spiders. \\"Composition in the Act\\" His album in 2006 Dos Improntuswith renowned accordionist, Raúl Barboza, was a meeting of different musical worlds.Plaza, Gabriel Un choque de dos planetas musicales La Nacion 12 Dec 2006 Edelstein's intention was that through playing together in a process of composition in the moment (rather than formally writing) he would create a new kind of synthesis of the Argentine experience and history of music. The disc has caused much discussion and is influencing musical culture in Argentina and Latin America, including becoming sited in various research works. Other examples of Edelstein's kind of essential synthesis (but in these cases fully scored) are Tangos Cientificos [Scientific Tangos], Viril Occidente II, Klange Urutaú and La Teoría Sagrada del Espacio Acústico – Libro I with the ENS, O Tiempo, La Condena and Alma's Waltz. Alma's Waltz, written for his daughter, was composed to sound simple but is in actuality incredibly difficult to play − the idea being that only the man who could succeed in playing it could ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. The waltz has attained such popularity that many people do not know its author and believe that it is an anonymous traditional folk waltz - a fact that Edelstein greatly enjoys.  Argentina & Andrómeda  Edelstein Photo by Daniel KarpEdelstein is informed by the tradition of the Argentine intellectual avant-garde and as such many comparisons have been made to musicians, like Charles Ives, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard VarèseMonjeau, Federico Volúmenes Musicales Clarin 14 July 2004 and John Cage, but also to more popular or rock musicians like Hermeto Pascoal, Frank Zappa, and King Crimson.\\"The choice of instruments can be easily associated to the world of rock, but it is only a sound- colour because the group is impelled by Edelstein to explore zones that go much further, for example than the advanced experience of Robert Fripp, the leader of King Crimson\\". Liut, Martín Música con tracción a sangre La Nacion Edelstein says, \\"Critics and specialists sometimes make comparisons in order to try to explain me to others who don't know my work. I really appreciate their intent because we always understand in our own dimension. I know that I am not so \\"important\\" or popular but I am sure that I am totally new.\\" Comparisons to Cage\\"Edelstein's constructive profile has an imprint in the saturation of sound, of style, of discursiveness, of planes, of spaces, in which silence has a punctual role. Diverse in production, Edelstein's work may be placed in the opposite side of the arch in relation to the production of Cage followers in Buenos Aires. However, in conceptual rupture and performative potency, in its commitment with the social contingency to which it belongs, Edelstein's work aligns with works such as Cage's resulting from a remarkable technical mastery (from the classics to the most updated procedures), and a defined creative profile. Edelstein's work projects new directions in multiple senses in the field of vocality in performance, from the twentieth century to the future.\\"Davini, Silvia, Machines of Flight and Creation: The Human and the Non Human in Edelstein's vocal territories in Voice Cartographies in Contemporary Theatrical Performance: an Economy of Actor's Vocality on Buenos Aires' Stages in the 1990s Ph.D. Thesis, University of London, Senate House, London, June 2000 are often made because of his multi-disciplinary universe and his cutting edge ideas, however his music in contrast to Cage's can be described as Maximilist. Edelstein is seen as emerging from three sources; the tradition of the contemporary music of Argentina, in the line of composers who he very much appreciates, such as Juan Carlos Paz, Francisco Kröpfl, Carmelo Saitta, Gerardo Gandini, Mariano Etkin and many others; the popular musicians like Isaco Abitbol, Raúl Barboza, Remo Pignoni, Dino Saluzzi and Cuchi Leguizamón, to name but a few that he listened to whilst growing up; and equally to the colleagues and the composers of his generation that contributed to making the group Otras Musicas, including Pablo Di Liscia, Gustavo Mirabile and Daniel Montes. However, now like Arnold Schönberg, Edelstein says, he learns most from his students, and the ENS (Ensamble Nacional del Sur) is an example of this. Students have asked Edelstein that if Stockhausen receives his influences from andrómeda, what radiation does he receive; he always replies with a smile, \\"Well, I am andrómeda!\\" The scope of his artistic visions, which include a new system of composition, design of instruments, theory, notation and theatre, could be compared to a Wagnerian's ideal, but Edelstein insists that he is more Argentine and Latin American – in other words more innocent, imaginative, ironic and hopefully little less ridiculous. He says enigmatically, \\"In the classic Woody Allen joke when you hear Wagner you want to invade Poland, I hope when you hear my music you want to do the hippo-campo dance.\\" He goes on to say that it is hard for a European or for an Argentine formed in the classic European tradition of music to understand that life in the little province is spent between racing cars, poetry, music, horses, football and women. New Techniques: Methods in Notation, Composition & Improvisation − Conducting as an Element of Composition=Research − Teatro Acústico / Acoustic Theatre Oscar Edelstein's Acoustic GridEdelstein is currently, Senior professor, Head of Composition (Acoustic and Electro Acoustic), and Director of a research programme at the University of Quilmes, in 2006 his research programme into new musical theories and acoustic techniques, the Programa de investigación Teatro Acústico, won another landmark victory – it received funding from the Agencia de Promocion Científica y Tecnologica (a government agency that depends from the Argentinian Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva,http://www.agencia.mincyt.gov.ar/ \\\\- the first time that a project in the arts has been awarded science funding and thus it was a major breakthrough for Edelstein's research group. Working with a team of mathematicians, physicists, engineers, composers and musicians, Edelstein is developing his original ideas for new materials, techniques and approaches in spatial acoustics for theatre. His ideas of Acoustic Theatre include; a new system of control and notation of the acoustic space (The Acoustic Grid); entirely acoustic (non-electronic) techniques for a new system of composition; the creation a new kind of acoustic instrument (acousmonium); and the acoustic design of a new theatre. Edelstein's team are utilizing new materials based in the principal of sonic crystals to modulate the architecture of the acoustic space so as to add a new real-time parameter of control in a musical performance. Their researches will make the space itself an instrument for the contemporary composer. The register of this work made in collaboration with the physicist, Manuel Eguía, has been produced in the University of Quilmes, Argentina, and the first international publication is in Germany in 2007.Edelstein, Oscar & Eguía, Manuel Grilla acústica (Oscar Edelstein in collaboration with Manuel Eguía) Editor: Amalia Barboza Published: Gutleut Verlag de Frankfurt a. Main 2007 Edelstein has been invited to many important institutions to give masterclasses and lectures based on his theories of composition and concept of \\"Acoustic Theatre\\", namely in Manhattan School of Music, and Columbia University (USA); Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music, University of Central England, Royal Northern College of Music and Drama, and the University of Wales – Aberystwyth (UK); and the University of Music and Performing Arts (Vienna) amongst others. Ensamble Nacional del Sur His electro acoustic group, the Ensamble Nacional del Sur (ENS for short) are hugely popular, critically acclaimed as revolutionary, achieving a cult following in both Brazil and Argentina, and seen by Edelstein as a new instrument of composition. Created by Edelstein in 1997, as a working group of research, creation and independent music production, they were conceived as a musical lab composed of musicians, composers, artists and technicians. Edelstein works with systems of traditional notation combined with new and 3-dimensional models that he created. He conducts the group with his specially developed system of hand signals so that he can not only designate time and intensity but also timbrical and spatial options. The members of the ENS are composers as well as musicians and thus could effectively respond to these directions. They have played in a number of Edelstein's acoustic theatre works, including the first part of the trilogy La Teoría Sagrada del Espacio Acoustico – Libro I (2000–2001); Klange, Klange, Urutau (1997) − described by Clarín's music critic Federico Monjeau as \\"an hour of music without interruptions, and without a moment of weakness\\";Monjeau, Federico, Música, Improvisácion y poesía Clarin 31 July 1997 and El Hecho (1998) which Monjeau called \\"a profound theatrical idea and fascinating music.\\"Monjeau, Federico El enigmático senor Paz Clarín 20 June 1998 Critic Martín Liut commented, \\"Oscar Edelstein opens new horizons for modern music and opera in Argentina.\\"Liut, Martín El ultimo adios a Juan Carlos Paz La Nacion In 1999 Edelstein presented El Tiempo, La Condena in Brazil and Argentina, critics called the work a \\"shock of music and the avantgarde in the heart of Brazil.\\"Corrieo Brasiliense Their performances were considered as \\"the most important musical events of the last decade in Argentina.\\".Fischerman, Diego En epoca de Guerra cultural, hay que actuar como un ejército Pagina 12, 1 Dec 1998 Since its creation in 1997, Oscar Edelstein has brought together and trained many talented young musicians. The current group is: Axel Lastra (Piano & Keyboards), Leonardo Salzano (Electric Guitar), Pablo Torterolo (Drums), and Mauro Zannoli (Keyboards and Processing). Regular guest artists are Deborah Claire Procter (Vocals) and Martín Proscia (Saxophone). Other guest musicians for the recent live concerts of Studies for The Acoustic Grid - Book II include Carlos Adriano Herrera (Bassoon), Soko Rodrigo (Flute), and Federico Linari (Harmonica). Past permanent members were Mario Castelli, Nicolás Varchausky, Mariano Cura, Richard Arce, Jerónimo Carmona, and Diego Romero Mascaró. Temporary members have been Pablo Chimenti, Hernán Kerlleñevich, Damián Anache, Nahuel Tavosnanska, Alfonso Ollúa, Rosa Nolly, Maria Laura Antonelli, and many others. In 2014, for the most recent disc, the ensemble was joined by prestigious Argentinean artists, pianist-composer Ernesto Jodos and wood wind multi-instrumentalist Marcelo Moguilevsky. La Teoría Sagrada del Espacio Acoustico – Libro I In 2004, La Teoría Sagrada del Espacio Acoustico – Libro I was recorded in Super Audio by the Ensamble Nacional del Sur. It was critically acclaimed and created a considerable excitement as the first disc in Latin America to be recorded in Super Audio (5.1)Liut, Martín Argentinos y vanguardistas Página 7 Espectáculos LA NACION 27.06.2004 and as the first work in the world to have been specifically composed for this system. Edelstein both conducted the ENS and played the piano alongside, Mariano Cura (Keyboards / Technical Head), Nicolás Varchausky (Electric Guitar), Diego Romero Mascaró (Drums & Percussion), Mario Castelli (Piano), Jerónimo Carmona (Bass & Double Bass) and Richard Arce (Electric Guitar).  El Hecho [The Fact]  El Hecho [The Fact] (1998), due to its popularity and controversy, was performed over fifty times, which is unusual for a new opera. The work was made in memory of Juan Carlos Paz, inspired by Paz' graphic design, Seis eventos [Six Events] which was Paz' last work but which was never musically realised it was the first work to pay homage to the famous Argentine composer and in it Edelstein also makes reference to his thwarted attempt to study with Paz.Apiccella, Mauro Quise liberar a Juan Carlos Paz de los sistemas teóricos La Maga 1 July 1998 Performed with the Ensamble Nacional del Sur (ENS) and three actor- singers, in the story a caricature of a theoretician desperately tries to explain Paz's mysterious designs, whilst in contrast, a female character, who represents a voice that travels through time and space, makes references that could be taken as reminisces about the life of Paz. The character of Paz enters and listens to the two monologues, at first saying nothing but then finally shooting the theoretician, at which point \\"the voice\\" dies in Paz's arms and he recovers his voice, takes the gun and acts as if to shoot the other musicians (the ENS), including Edelstein as conductor, but finally puts the gun on Edelstein's piano. This tribute to the teacher he never had stirred debate about the position and relationship between the composer and the academy of music. The work was described as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"the most important opera in the story of Argentina.\\"Monjeau, Federico El enigmático senor Paz Clarín 20 June 1998  Opera  Many of Edelstein's works are grounded in the field of \\"the extended theatre of music\\", where he stresses a focus on voice, speech production and the interplay with technology. Often he works with non-classically trained singers and choirs, training them to develop a specific sound colour. He has a \\"guest choir\\" of voices that will often appear in his compositions. He prefers to describe his works as acoustic theatre, feeling that the word opera both does not fit many of his works that use electro acoustics and not the traditional orchestra. The two most recent works are 'La Carta Imaginaria' (2014) - commissioned by the Ministerio de Cultura de la Nación for the Ciclo Iberoamericano de Ópera Contemporánea, and \\"El Caballo Fantasma\\" (2011) - multimedia musical performance commissioned by the Ministerio de Cultura de la Nación.  Eterna Flotación - Los monstruito (2006)  In 2006, C.E.T.C., the experimental wing of Buenos Aires' opera house, Teatro Colón, commissioned and produced his opera Eterna Flotación-Los monstruito As often is the case in his works, the libretto was written by Edelstein, this time adapting poems from Lo Dado by Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill. The Clarín reviewed it as \\"Original, innovative – some pieces are like from the anthology of opera.\\" It was the first musical work to speak about the presidency of Carlos Menem. In the middle of scenes depicting the incredible decadence that Argentina fell into, Edelstein has a murga – a street-musical group common in Uruguay and Argentina often present at political protests – erupt into the theatre, cutting across conventional lines of opera as a \\"high\\" art. The final aria of the work is Edelstein's setting of \\"El Rio,\\" a poem by Juan L. Ortiz, that he uses to make a contrast with the scenes of decadence and decay.  Tiradentes (2003)  Having written over 14 works of what Edelstein prefers to call Acoustic Theatre − it is \\"Tiradentes\\" that is perhaps the most noteworthy for its scale and vision. With the subtitle, \\"The Dream of Heroes\\"Monjeau, Federico El sueño de los héroes Clarin 30 May 2004 it was the first opera to speak about a figure who Edelstein calls \\"Brazil's only real national hero\\", \\"Tiradentes\\" was an opera to take place over three days, about the man who led a revolt \\"La conspiración de Minas Gerais.\\" Way before the French Revolution, it was the first act of self-determination in Brazil, which many years later contributed to Brazil's independence, which happened much later than the rest of Latin America.Maxwell, Kenneth A devassa da devassa: a Inconfidencia Mineira: Brasil-Portugal Sao Paulo: Paz e Terra, 1985 / Milliet, Maria Alice Tiradentes: O Corpo do Herói Sao Paulo: Martins Fontes 2001 As a joint project between the universities of Quilmes (Argentina) and Brasilia (Brazil) it was to be staged throughout Brasilia's model city. The complex project involved a team of more than two hundred actors, plastics artists, technicians and musicians from both countries, and received the backing of UNESCO and funding from prominent foundations. However, the project was ultimately postponed by a combination of factors, including the controversy that the history of Tiradentes provoked (such as Tiradentes' known links to the freemasons), political and diplomatic problems between Argentina and Brazil, and political issues in Brazil. Though it is a project that was fully conceived, composed and scored by Edelstein; finally only part of it was performed. Edelstein hopes to one day complete the project.  Orchestral  In recent years Edelstein has decided to return to writing for orchestra. In 2010 this decision led to a commission from Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional, under the direction of Pedro Ignacio Calderón with the soloist Eduardo Isaac (guitar) and called \\"La Foto Del Tiempo.\\" Then in 2011 came a commission from Basel Sinfonietta leading to \\"Cristal Argento I\\" and a premiere conducted by José Luis Gomez - who had just won first prize in the International Conductor's Competition of Sir Georg Solti at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt, and went gone on to be in 2016 the new Musical Director of the Tucson Symphony Orchestra. Both works used live electronic processing. Edelstein has a new major orchestral work in process.

Edelstein uses his aria, \\"El Rio\\", again in his work Rivers and Mirrors: Part I with singer Deborah Claire Procter (Wales) who also made the film to accompany the performance with the dancer Sandra Grinberg of the Trisha Brown Dance Company.

Sven Rydenfelt was born in Hjärnarp, Ängelholm Municipality, Sweden. He became politically active during the 1940s when he started to write for several newspapers and journals. In 1945 he became the first chairman of the Liberal Student Association (affiliated with the social liberal People's Party) in Lund. Within the People's Party, Rydenfelt was considered as a rising young man and a possible candidate as Member of Parliament. However, due to a conflict with then party leader Bertil Ohlin over the party's stance on value added tax (which Rydenfelt opposed and Ohlin supported), Rydenfelt was forced to leave the party. During the 1950s he came to work for the Moderate Party instead. Among other things, he authored the party's program on housing policy. However, due to his strong support for the free market he was still considered too controversial by some. Rydenfelt predicted already in 1956 the future collapse of the Soviet Union. In an article in the journal Samtid och Framtid (no.5/1956) he wrote: \\"Some argue that only a third world war could bring the Soviet Empire to an end. An inconsolable thought. If merely we have patience, it will crack from within, and through its gravel and ashes a new and more free Russia will rise\\". In 1956, Rydenfelt was elected to the Mont Pelerin Society where he learned to know people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman who came to influence much of his political thinking. During the 1960s he continued his criticism of what he saw as the overregulated Swedish economy. In 1966 he authored the book Säkerhetspolisens hemliga register – om åsiktsfrihet och åsiktsförföljelse (\\"The Secret Registry of the Security Service – On Freedom of Opinion And Political Persecution\\") together with Janerik Larsson. This book led the Swedish Security Service to classify him as a \\"dangerous leftist activist\\" (). It was first during the 1970s and 1980s that Rydenfelt's work and ideas was to be recognized in Sweden, and he became something of an icon among young Swedish conservatives and neoliberals. Due to his, for the Swedish political establishment, controversial opinions, he wasn't given a professorship until 1991, when the ministry of Carl Bildt took office. However, Rydenfelt continued to criticize both the Social Democrats as well as the non-socialist parties. Towards the end of his life, Rydenfelt was a member of the editorial board of the journal Nyliberalen (\\"The Neoliberal\\"). He was also critical of the European Union and was an honorary member of Citizens Against EMU (), the main non-socialist organization which campaigned against Sweden's adoption of the euro during the referendum in 2003.

Lee and Frederic Dannay), published in 1951. It is set in Los Angeles, US. Plot summary The beautiful young Laurel Hill asks Ellery Queen to investigate a series of unusual anonymous gifts that have been received by her father, Leander Hill, half of Hill and Priam, Wholesale Jewelers. Roger Priam is Leander's partner, who uses a wheelchair. The latest gift, a dead dog with a mysterious note in a silver casket around its neck, has caused Leander to have a heart attack and die. Now Roger Priam (and his sultry wife Delia, who attracts Ellery like a carnivorous plant) has started to receive unusual anonymous gifts as well. Delia's nudist son Crowe, who is Laurel's boyfriend, and a cast of servants, are also on the scene. The mysterious gifts include some poisoned tuna fish salad, a green alligator wallet, a burned book and a bundle of worthless stocks and bonds, all accompanied by cryptic and ominous notes, and it seems as though they date back to a mysterious and possibly violent incident in the past of both Hill and Priam that gets them started in the wholesale jewelry business. Ellery Queen works out the significance of the series of gifts and the link that connects the notes and arranges a dramatic surprise that traps the criminal—although the true criminal is not known until the final moments of the book. Literary significance & criticism After many popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel is the final Ellery Queen novel set in Hollywood. Earlier novels like The Four of Hearts and short stories featuring gossip columnist Paula Paris were connected with the writers' work in Hollywood for Ellery Queen movies some ten years ago and had a light comedic tone. This novel is slightly more serious and topical (Crowe the nudist is living in a tree to prepare for life after the atom bomb) but suffers from the same problem as other Queen novels, such that events and characters are unrealistic because they must meet the needs of the underlying theme that links the plot elements and forms the basis of the puzzle. \\"It's fair to say that the Hollywood novels made a pleasant read, but nothing more.\\"Q.B.I.: A website on Ellery Queen References External links  *\\"Ellery Queen is the American detective story.\\" Category:1951 American novels Category:Novels by Ellery Queen Category:Novels set in Los Angeles Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books ","title":"The Origin of Evil"},{"id":"13350105","text":"Erick Morgan Threets (born November 4, 1981) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

Smith and Kennedy formed Motherlode in 1969 and relocated to London, Ontario, where they struggled and stayed with friends. They finally got a break following their debut at the Image Club when Mort Ross signed them to Revolver Records that same year. Their first single, \\"When I Die\\" that was produced by Doug Riley and Terry Brown did not make any headway on the radio. A reciprocal deal in the US with Buddah Records made the song a hit reaching Number 18 on the charts.

Brooks contributed a song \\"Memories of A Broken Promise\\" as well as some background vocals to Motherlode's When I Die album. Motherlode also contributed a song and instrumental backing on Brooks album, Another Kind Of Soul that was released on Revolver Records.Toronto Blues Society More About Dianne Brooks by Bill Munson The group broke up in January 1970 and their second album, Tapped Out, was released posthumously only in the United States. Steve Kennedy, Ken Marco and Wayne Stone went on to be founding members of Dr. Music in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As Revolver Records owned the name Motherlode, it decided to reform the group, keeping William Smith making this the second version of the group. They had Smith bring in three new musicians, Doug Richardson (saxophone), Anthony Shinault (guitar) and Philip Wilson (drums). This version of Motherlode, the second released one single in late in 1970, \\"I'm So Glad You're You (And Not Me)\\" / \\"Whipoorwill\\" (instrumental). Their new single flopped and the group quickly broke up. Mort Ross, Revolver Record's president brought in Gord Waszek, of the rock group Leigh Ashford, to begin writing for the third version of Motherlode. They recorded \\"All That's Necessary\\", with Breen Leboeuf on vocals, Mike Levine on bass plus Gord Waszek and several other members of Leigh Ashford. The B-side of this single was \\"My Chant\\" which was just a renamed version of \\"Hiro Smothek\\" from 1970's Tapped Out. To promote this record, another version of Motherlode, the fourth was created with Mike Levine (bass), Wayne St. John (vocals), Kieran Overs (guitar) and two former members of Leigh Ashford, Wally Cameron (drums) and Newton Garwood (keyboards). Despite a major promotion push the record flopped and the band broke up.\\"Motherlode group is reformed for recording\\". RPM Weekly, December 5, 1970. pages 8-9 By March 1971, a fifth version of Motherlode was created from the remnants of Natural Gas, a Montreal-based group. The members were Dave Berman (saxophone),Brian Dewhurst (drums), Gerry Legault (bass, vocals), Joey Roberts [Miquelon] (guitar) and Brian Wray (keyboards). They never managed to recording anything, and became Truck with the addition of Graham Lear. Later years The original Motherlode members reunited in 1976, and recorded a song \\"Happy People\\" but, because of issues surrounding the name Motherlode, it had to be released as a Kenny Marco solo release. In November 1989, they used the name Motherlode for a reunion during a week of live performances at the Bluenote club in Toronto. In 1990 they recorded eight new songs, but those sessions have remained unreleased.Canadian Pop Encyclopedia - Artist: Motherlode With the exception of some of the material in the \\"Later Years\\" section, most of this Wikipedia article is a minor edit of the Canadian Pop Encyclopedia entry.

In reality, the film was made primarily in 2002 and was released in several international film festivals late that year, including Pusan. Chinese drama film directed by Zhang Yuan and starring Xu Jinglei and Tong Dawei. The film was a co-production between the Xi'an Film Studio and Jewel Film Investment Company. It is one of three films made by Zhang in 2002 (the other two being a film of the 1964 communist opera Jiang jie, and the romantic comedy, Green Tea) marking one of the more prolific periods in his career. I Love You is based on author Wang Shuo's novel Get a Kick and Die. Zhang would again adapt one of Wang's stories in 2006's Little Red Flowers.  Plot  Du Xiaoju (Xu Jinglei) and Wang Yi (Tong Dawei) are two people in their 20s living in contemporary Beijing. As the film opens, Xiaoju is about to marry one of Yi's friends. Before the day of the wedding, her fiancé inadvertently commits suicide by diving into an empty swimming pool while drunk. Devastated, Xiaoju becomes increasingly close to Wang Yi, which causes them to fall in love and marry. The honeymoon period between Xiaoju and Yi proves short, however, as Xiaoju begins to exhibit increasingly unbalanced behavior. She teases her husband about harboring a crush on her former roommate (Pan Juan), and interrogates him on his former partners. Soon, the teasing erupts into public rows, much to the consternation of their friend, Pan Youjun (Du Peng). As Xiaoju becomes convinced that her husband no longer loves her, her behavior become erratic, obsessive, and ultimately dangerous. Cast *Xu Jinglei as Du Xiaoju (the wife) *Tong Dawei as Wang Yi (the husband) *Du Peng as Pan Youjun (the married friend of Wang Yi and Du Xiaoju) *Pan Juan as Jia Ling (Du Xiaoju's roommate at the hospital) *Hou Junjie as Pan's wife  Production  By the early 2000s, Zhang Yuan had decided to make a romance film, a genre he had never tackled before. Upon mentioning this to his friend, author Wang Shuo, the latter suggested that he adapt one of his old novels, Get a Kick and Die (sometimes translated as Live it up before You Die). Reading the book, Zhang agreed, though he moved the story's action forward from the 1980s to present day Beijing.Berry, Michael (2005). \\"Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna\\" in Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press, p. 155. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-11-05. While Zhang had worked with major authors before (notably Yu Hua and Zhu Wen in 1999's Seventeen Years), I Love You marked the first time Zhang would directly adapt a literary work. Filming took only a month, and the entire shoot used only a single camera. Zhang has noted that he chose this style of filming in part to utilize long-takes. Additionally, it allowed him to focus on single characters while filming, with reactions of other characters only being implied by the reactions by the camera's subject. Even though I Love You was an adaptation, Zhang approached the film with total freedom of creativity, in part because he found the story very realistic. In an interview, Zhang noted that filming the two main characters was like shooting a documentary, noting that the shoot \\"recaptured the same mindset that [he] had on Sons.\\"Berry, p. 156. Zhang has spoken about what he was attempting to capture for the film: Reception Unlike many of Zhang's earlier works (notably Beijing Bastards and East Palace, West Palace), I Love You was released domestically in China in late October 2002. By November 2002, I Love You had grossed nearly 10 million RMB ($1.2m), thus making it Zhang's biggest commercial success yet. Internationally, the film has also done well, premiering at many major film festivals including Sundance, Rotterdam, Karlovy Vary, Deauville, and Pusan. Like his previous film, Seventeen Years, Zhang Yuan's foray into mainstream movie making has been both praised and criticized. While Derek Elley of Variety argues that the film represents a move towards \\"maturity,\\" Richard James Havis of The Hollywood Reporter takes an opposite tack, arguing that the film's lack of political grounding and mainstream nature leaves it a \\"cold romantic thriller\\" that \\"lacks the emotional muscle\\" to appeal to international audiences. Theme song The theme song \\"Wo Ai Ni\\" (我爱你; \\"I Love You\\") was composed by Zhang Yadong, written by Xiao Wei (肖玮) of Catcher in the Rye and performed by Faye Wong. It was included in Zhang's 2009 album Underflow (潜流).

The paper is a member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN) and is owned and published by Stewart Sallo. Overview Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, Sallo decided it was time to leave Santa Cruz, Calif., where he owned and published two other publications — Summer Santa Cruz and Student Guide. By 1992, he had set his sights on Boulder, Colo. He moved to Boulder in 1993, and the first edition of Boulder Weekly hit the stands on Aug. 19 of that year. In the years since, Boulder Weekly has garnered numerous state journalism awards for opinion, news, features and entertainment writing. For several years, from 1996 to 2000, the Weekly had a competitor in the Boulder Planet; Sallo considers the Weekly's perseverance over the well-funded competitor a source of pride and professional accomplishment. The paper is currently the only independent newspaper published in Boulder. Sallo originally envisioned the paper as business opportunity in a town that didn't have a weekly newspaper. However, a story written by Joel Dyer in September 1994 changed Sallo's perspective about the potential for a newspaper to create change in the world (\\"Deadly ground: Beech Aircraft toxins poison open space,\\" Sept. 14, 1994). As a result, Boulder Weekly's editorial direction shifted toward a more aggressive, alternative approach to news. Dyer later became editor of Boulder Weekly, eventually leaving the paper to write books and publish his own newsweekly, the Fort Collins Weekly, from 2002 to 2007. Greg Campbell continued with that same editorial direction, putting the paper in the spotlight with articles such as, \\"Eternal flame: Think you've paid at the pump? Try paying with your life. Boulder Weekly visits Nigeria,\\" April 19, 2001, which exposed the suffering of a Nigerian village at the hands of an Italian gas company. Campbell is the author of Blood Diamonds: Tracing the Deadly Path of the World's Most Precious Stones. Wayne Laugesen became editor of Boulder Weekly after working at Soldier of Fortune magazine and brought a conservative balance to the paper. He is best known for his award-winning opinion column \\"Wayne's Word,\\" and his byline has appeared in national magazines and nearly every major newspaper in the United States. Pamela White became the first woman editor of the paper in February 2003. An award-winning journalist and novelist, White professionalized the newsroom operation and brought with her a special emphasis on human-rights reporting, with a focus on prison issues, women's rights and American Indian issues. She came to the Weekly after serving as editor of Colorado Daily, where she and her staff won the 2000 Roy W. Howard Award for Public Service (National Journalism Awards) and several other national awards for investigative journalism. Joel Dyer returned to the Weekly as editor in November 2011. The paper currently employees 18 full-time staff, in addition to numerous freelance writers and circulation drivers. It publishes opinion, news, an outdoor recreation section, a food section, and an arts and entertainment section, as well as several special editions, notably The Best of Boulder County, tri-annual Boulderganic, Summer Scene, Student Guide, and VOTE, its annual election guide. Regular contributors to the paper include populist author and columnist Jim Hightower, astrologer Rob Brezsny author Ben Corbett, former Boulder mayor Paul Danish, and music critic David Kirby. Awards Among the Boulder Weekly's awards, in April 2018, it won 27 awards in the 2017 Society of Professional Journalists' Top of the Rockies competition, including 10 first prizes.

He is notable for designing coins such as the British 20 Pence Coin and some of the coins of Cyprus, New Zealand, Jordan, Guyana, Dominican Republic, Sri Lanka and the Falkland Islands. Education After having studied calligraphy and letter design at the Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute in his teens, Gardner enrolled at The Royal College of Art, simultaneously studying (in his second and third years), at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under George Friend, J. H. Mason, Barry Hart and Martin Travers. In 1939 his studies were finally rewarded with a diploma and The Travelling Scholarship from the Royal College of Art. Professional career Gardner was most well known for his designs for the reverses of the 1953 three penny piece, English and Scottish shillings and the decimal 20p reverse of 1982 still in use today. The artist engraved the coins himself. He also designed the British Privy Council Seal, the HM Greater and Lesser Signets as well as the seals of the British Medical Association and the Royal Society of Arts. With the outbreak of World War II, Gardner was soon posted to the Army Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham, where he became involved in the training of 7,000 men of all ranks. Before D-Day he was regularly in the air to advise on camouflaging the build-up of forces. In November 1944 together with a colleague, he set up and ran a new camouflage training school at Scottish Command, Edinburgh. For the next few years after demobilisation, he spent much of his time as a visiting lecturer in lettering, heraldic design and penmanship at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, The Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, and Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute (the latter until 1973). During this period Rolls of Honour commissioned by King George VI for the Household Cavalry were inscribed. A considerable variety of commissions in coin design, heraldry and lettering were completed and in 1955 he became a fellow of the RSA, subsequently serving on the jury of its Industrial Design Bursary scheme. He also reviewed books over a long period for the RSA Journal. He was an examiner for The City and Guilds of London Institute in craft subjects and the definitive Jersey stamp was designed in 1958 and the Tercentenary stained glass window for the Royal Society in 1960. In 1963 Gardner was visiting professor and fine art program lecturer at Colorado State University and in the years immediately following he travelled widely to research art and crafts of the United States, Polynesia, New Zealand, Australia and Nepal. A calligraphic volume for Eton College was completed in 1990. William Gardner was a Fellow of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators and a Fellow of the Society of Numismatic Artists and Designers.

It is an official school of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. History With the help of the Christianity and Missionary Alliance in the USA and Canada, the Evangelical Community of the Alliance in Congo launched the Boma Seminary in September 1976. Three students were part of the first class: Esaron Lelo Mavinga, Dynobert Nlandu Nguala and Justin- Abraham Kumbu-ki-Makaya. With a teaching faculty of three full-time professors, Raymur Downey, Lammert Hukema, and Britta Hukema, and one visiting professor, Nathalis Songo Vangu, who became full-time professor the following year, what was then known as Institut Supérieur Théologie Évangélique de Boma (ISTEB) began to offer pastoral training leading to an undergraduate degree. The arrival of Dr. Floyd Shank in 1979 gave a new impetus the seminary's academic programs, establishing a trend that continued with the arrival of new professors, such as Arie Verduijn (1981), K. Bruce Edwards (1983), Esaron Lelo Mavinga (January 1986), Mabiala Justin-Robert Kenzo (October 1986), Louis Matundu Zulu (1986), Philippe Manzali Tsisi (1986), Claude Lendo Luyindula (1990), César Mata Ndudi (1991), Lydie Kwangu Seke (1991), Joseph Ngoma Nzita (1992), Véronique Mabiala Dikoba Ngoma (1992), Jérémie Khele Tsatu (1994), Nzuzi Mbenza (2000), Anastasie Masanga Mampoda (2004), and Gabriel Tsumbu Mayunda (2005). The seminary has also greatly benefited from its roster of part-time and visiting professors such as Joachim Maduka Nzau, Joseph Mavinga Nzita, Timothée Taty Tshika, Justin Mayenda Ma Mbongo, Kitikila Dimonika, Nymi Panzu, Chris Braun, and Ron Brown. Under the leadership of Dr. Nathalis Songo Vangu, its first African Rector, the seminary underwent a significant growth sprout. As an example, in June 1991, 11 men and women graduated from FACTEB. Unfortunately, this growth would come to a virtual halt with the turmoil in the Congo during the nineties. Yet, it is also during this time that the seminary changed its status from a seminary to graduate school, offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees. This explains the change in the name of the institution, from Institut Supérieur de Théologie Évangélique de Boma (ISTEB) to Faculté de Théologie Évangélique de Boma (FACTEB). Academics FACTEB offers undergraduate degree programs and master's degrees through on- campus study.

The park contains the highest peak of the Appalachian Mountains in Canada, Mont Jacques-Cartier, 1,270 meters above sea level. In addition, the park contains the only population of Caribou found south of the Saint Lawrence River in Canada. A panorama of the mountains in Gaspésie National Park Geology There are two major and geologically distinct mountain ranges in the park. The first one, to the west of the St-Anne's River, is the Chic-Choc Mountain range. This range is 600 million years old and was mainly formed from underwater volcanic activity. In contrast, the McGerrigle Mountains are much younger, only 380 million years. From the depths of the sea, magma oozed through cracks in the Earth's crust and then cooled, resulting in a large underground granite batholith. Over time, the softer sedimentary rocks above the batholith eroded away, leaving only the resistant granite. Mont Jacques- Cartier is part of this range. Climate Owing the area's elevation and proximity to the Saint Lawrence River, the climate of the park is very different from the lowlands of Quebec. Mont Logan, at an altitude of 1,150 m, has an average annual temperature of -3.6 degrees Celsius. This low temperature, combined with the lower pressure at high altitude, causes moisture to condense and fall as rain or snow; in fact, these mountains are the wettest region of Quebec. http://www.sepaq.com/pq/gas/decouvrir/portrait.dot  Gallery  Lac aux Américains, Parc national de la Gaspésie, Québec, Canada.jpgLac aux Américains ParcGaspesie.jpgMountains, winter 2008-2009 Mont Jacques- Cartier.JPGMount Jacques-Cartier summit Grande Cuve du Mont-Albert, Parc de la Gaspésie, Québec, Canada.jpgGrande Cuve, Mount Albert Chute Sainte-Anne - 03.jpgSainte-Anne waterfall Lac sur le plateau au sommet du Mont-Albert, Parc de la Gaspésie, Québec, Canada.jpgLake on the plateau at the summit of Mount Albert See also *List of Quebec provincial & national parks *National Parks of Canada *List of National Parks of Canada External links *Official site References Category:National parks of Quebec Category:Tourist attractions in Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine Category:Hiking trails in Quebec Category:Protected areas of Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine ","title":"Gaspésie National Park"},{"id":"13350674","text":"Johann Heinrich Christfried Dau (1790–1831) was a Holstein-Danish geologist and writer, whose identification of peat layers led eventually to a system of classifying and dating post-glacial northern European paleoclimate periods, the \\"Blytt-Sernander\\" sequences based on peat stratigraphy.

Azraai, whom one of the most successful coach in Malaysia when he considered to be one of the best football coaches and he has also won more trophies than any other coaches in the history of Malaysian football especially when he brought Kedah FA to be a legendary football team in Malaysia when they crowned as a double treble champion - a champion for all three major football competitions. Personal life Khor Sek Leng was born in Alor Star, Kedah has been reverted to Islam in 2001 and changed his Muslim name to Mohd Azraai Khor Abdullah. Azraai now lives with his wife Rohani Ibrahim, eldest son Mohd Firdaus (age 16), daughters Siti Fairuz (15) and Nur Azryena (5) at their resident in Alor Star. Playing career He was a Kedah FA player for Malaysia Cup competition and also was in Kedah Kilat FC (a team of Tenaga Nasional Berhad or formerly known as Lembaga Letrik Negara Tanah Melayu before 1990) for FAM Cup competition from 1969 until 1980. He played as midfielder, right winger and also has skippered the team. Azraai also was a former part of Malaysia national team in the period of 3 years starting from 1975 until 1978. Coaching careers=Early careers In 1991, at the age of 39 Azraai was appointed head coach of Kedah FA President Cup team. He worked as part of the club's youth team for several years - 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002. However his glorious career began eighteen years ago in 1993 when he and his colleague, Azman Haji Eusoff was just an up-and-coming tactician, assisting Robert Alberts to create history with a bunch of great players included his assistants now Muhamad Radhi Mat Din and Ahmad Sabri Ismail, from the second division title without losing in 1992 to clean sweep of the domestic football titles in 1993 – Division 1 (the now renamed Malaysia Super League) and Malaysia Cup. Kelantan TNB FC head coach Before return to Kedah, Azraai has previously managed Kelantan TNB FC in 2002 when he was an employee of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), an electricity company in Malaysia. Kedah head coach After late Ahmad Basri Akil brought him in August 2004, with his fantastic \\"Midas Touch\\", Azraai gives a miracle for Kedah state football environment after they've been dropped to the last place in 2004 Malaysia Super League competition. Kedah on that time handled by Mirandinha. After Mirandinha left the job, Azraai who returned to Kulim from Kelantan as a full-time TNB employee on that time has rejuvenated the team and creates fantastic achievements in Malaysia Cup competition when he led Kedah through to the 2004 Final, but they lost 1-0 against Perlis FA. Successive 'double treble' Azraai now became the only coach, to win double treble champions in successive 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons. After he clinched the third cup in Malaysian football arena, coach Azraai also regarded the 2006/07 Malaysian Favourite Coach Award in 100Plus-F.A.M National Football Awards as an additional motivation after his team won three titles - Malaysian FA Cup, Malaysian Super League, and Malaysia Cup in 2006/07 season and also as a boost for the future of football in Kedah and in the country. And a few hours before he creates another historical moment of Malaysian football on 23 August 2008, he once again awarded as the 2007/08 Malaysian Best Coach Award in the same awards after Kedah retained the 2007/08 Malaysian Super League and Malaysian FA Cup trophies for second consecutive times. Azraai deserved the awards after his Kedah wonder boys won the Malaysia Cup final defeated Selangor FA with 3-2 result. After Kedah He resigned from Kedah after the 2009 season, which Kedah failed to scale the heights of the previous two seasons, mainly because of the loss of his influential import players due to new ruling by FAM. His problems with the new management team also led to his departure. He was appointed the head coach of Harimau Muda A in 2010, but resigned later in the year after confrontation with the team's technical personnel and players during the squad training stint in Slovakia.http://www.bharian.com.my/bharian/articles/PenggantiAzraaidiputuskanhariini/Article/ In 2011, he was named as the new head coach of Negeri Sembilan FA, replacing Wan Jamak Wan Hassan (who ironically took over as head coach of Azraai former team Kedah later that season). Although Negeri Sembilan results were in dire when he took over, he improved the team's fortunes. The pinnacle of the season was where he led Negeri Sembilan to the 2011 Malaysia Cup triumph, beating Terengganu FA 2-1 in the final. On 15 October 2012, he was announced as Perak FA new coach. Signing a 2-year contract, Azraai resigned from his job in October 2013 after only one season, in which he guides Perak to seventh place in the league, but failed to lead Perak out of the group stage of 2013 Malaysia Cup, which includes a 6-1 thrashing by Sarawak FA.http://www.goal.com/en-my/news/3896/malaysia/2013/10/20/4346121/azraai- khor-resigns-as-perak-head-coachhttp://sg.news.yahoo.com/exclusive-defeat- never-imagined-azraai-khor-laments-loss-032520334--spt.html On 14 November 2013, he was officially unveiled as the new T-Team F.C. head coach.http://www.nst.com.my/sports/soccer/azraai-picks-t-team-1.400268 Azraai resigned from his job at the end of July 2014, after T-Team were relegated to Malaysia Premier League.http://www.nst.com.my/node/17698 On 24 March 2015, Azraai was appointed as the new head coach for Kelantan FA replacing George Boateng who was appointed as Technical Director.

It offers immunity against damage from intense electromagnetic radiation, produced by EMP and HPM sources. This receiver is known as ADNERF (an acronym used to signify an All-Dielectric Non-Electronic Radio Front-End). ADNERF is a type of Electro-Magnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver (EMPiRe).  Background  The continuing trend towards reduced feature size and voltage in integrated circuits renders modern electronics highly susceptible to damages caused by High Power Microwave (HPM) and other microwave based directed energy sources. These induce high voltage transient surges of thousands of volts which can punch through the gate insulator in the transistor and can destroy the circuit’s metal interconnects. To immunize electronic systems against such threats, the “soft spots” (metal and transistor) in a conventional receiver front-end, must be eliminated.  Operation  Fig. 1 Concept of the photonic- assisted all-dielectric RF front-end technology. An electro-optic (EO) powered dielectric antenna captures the free-space RF signal. The embedded optical link provides complete electrical isolation between the air interface and the electronic circuitry, which is located only after the photodetector (PD). Fig. 2 Details of the receiver front-end design. a, Three-dimensional drawing of the DRA. b, Numerical simulation of the distribution of the electric field of the TM_{011+\\\\delta} mode inside the DRA in meridian plane. The basic concept of this photonic-assisted all-dielectric RF front-end technology is shown in Fig. 1. The Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) in the front-end, functions as a concentrator of incoming electromagnetic field. When the electromagnetic (EM) field excites the resonance of DRA, a mode field pattern is built up inside the structure. The EO resonator is placed at the location of the peak field magnitude (Fig. 2). The EO resonator converts the received EM signal to an intensity modulated optical signal which is then carried away from the antenna front-end via an optical fiber. At the remote location, the signal is converted back to an RF signal which is then amplified and processed using conventional techniques. This front-end design significantly increases the threshold for damage associated with high power microwave signals. The lack of metal interconnects eliminates the one source of failure. In addition, the charge isolation provided by the optical link protects the electronic circuitry. Good sensitivity can be achieved due to signal enhancement provided by the microwave resonance in the DRA and optical resonance in the EO resonator. The modulating E-field (ERF) applied to the resonator should not be uniform across the disk otherwise no modulation occurs. To prevent this from happening, the EO resonator is placed off center from the symmetrical axis of DRA as shown in Fig. 2. The location of the EO resonator is chosen to coincide with the peak EM field inside the DRA, which is identified using 3-D EM simulations.  References  #Abrams, M. Dawn of the e-bomb.

Generally used in conjunction with training on a longe line, it is most often seen in the training of Saddle seat horses, but also is used by some dressage trainers and as a tool to start horses in driving. A basic bitting rig consists of a surcingle (also known as a roller) that has a number of rings on either side, placed at varying heights, usually with a crupper to prevent the surcingle from sliding forward. A bridle is also part of a bitting rig, with side reins and rings or small pulleys on either side of the browband to accommodate an overcheck. Some variations use pulleys and leverage on side reins to create a given \\"headset.\\" Other designs add straps resembling breeching on the hindquarters to encourage engagement of the horse's rear end. The use of only a surcingle and side reins, a common component in basic horse training across all equestrian disciplines, is not usually considered a \\"bitting rig.\\" It is the use of additional reins such as the overcheck, or the use of leverage to place the horse's head in a set position that turns a classic surcingle into a bitting rig. Both a bitting rig and a classic surcingle with side reins are intended only to be used while longeing a horse. They are not to be used on a horse that is standing in a stall (though this is a very common type of misuse), nor are they used while riding. However, the surcingle and side reins are used as safety tools in the sport of equestrian vaulting. While a surcingle and side reins are considered classical training tools, the use of the full bitting rig is controversial in some circles. The basic debate is whether the use of the overcheck or any other rein setup other than the classic side rein is unnatural and develops incorrect musculature in the neck, back, and hindquarters. Like any tool, a bitting rig can be overused, leading to soreness and fatigue in the horse, and in some cases, improper use may teach a horse to lean on the bit and develop a hard mouth rather than relaxing and giving to it. Misuse can also lead to a horse that holds its head in a set position, but fails to properly engage the hindquarters and learn proper collection. Proponents argue that it safely teaches a horse a correct head position and gently accustoms a horse to what will be expected of it when carrying a rider.

When the school was built in 1888, it was located on the western fringe of Omaha on an unpaved South 24th Street. At the time it was opened, it was the largest elementary school in Omaha, with sixteen classrooms. The first principal was Jennie McKoons, with a staff of five teachers. When it first opened the school had 326 students; however, within a few years it expanded so rapidly that three wooden additions had to be constructed to accommodate the student body.

He specializes in the art and archaeology of the Ancient Near East, in particular Ancient Persia and Anatolia. Muscarella is an untiring opponent of the Looting of ancient sites and has earned a reputation as the conscience of the discipline. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Oscar White Muscarella, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY, 1986. Early life Muscarella was born on March 26, 1931, in New York, New York (borough of Manhattan), as Oscar White to parents Oscar V. White, an elevator operator, and Anna Falkin.Elizabeth Simpson, ed., The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar: Papers Presented to Oscar White Muscarella (Leiden: Brill, 2018), 1. Oscar Sr. and Anna lived in the Bronx and were very poor. In 1936 Anna left Oscar White and abandoned Oscar Jr. and his brother Bobby to live with Salvatore “Sam” Muscarella, whom she later married in 1939. After living in an orphanage for a year, Oscar Jr. and Bobby went to live in Manhattan with Anna and Sam in 1937. While living in Manhattan, Muscarella joined the Gramercy Boy's Club, and it was in the club’s library that he began to read voraciously. In junior high school he was a good student, skipping a semester, despite working many outside jobs. His teachers there encouraged him to take the tests to qualify for the elite Stuyvesant High School, where he was accepted.Simpson, The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar, 1-2 At Stuyvesant he joined the Archaeology Club. A Miss Jones, the Club's librarian (and according to Muscarella, \\"my first and best librarian\\"Oscar White Muscarella, The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures (Groningen: Styx, 2000), iii.) was one of several people to whom he dedicated his 2000 book, The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures. He began college at New York University, but transferred in his second year to the City College of New York, working during the day. After six years in the Evening Session, he graduated in 1955 with a degree in History.Simpson, The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar, 3.  Career  In the summer of 1953, Muscarella went on his first excavation at Mesa Verde, a Pueblo Indian site in Colorado, which he followed with work on another excavation at Swan Creek, South Dakota. While at Swan Creek, he received a letter of acceptance from the University of Pennsylvania for graduate study in the Department of Classical Archaeology, and he enrolled. He joined the University of Pennsylvania team at the site of Gordion, Turkey, in 1957, the year he married Grace Freed, a fellow graduate student (in Latin) who later became an archaeological illustrator. In 1958-1959, he was a Fulbright Scholar at the American School of Classical Studies, Athens. Muscarella returned to work at Gordion in 1959 and 1963, and excavated in Iran at Hasanlu in 1960, 1962, and 1964; at Agrab Tepe in 1964; and at Ziwiye in 1964. In 1964 he joined the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965, writing his dissertation on Phrygian fibulae from Gordion. Simpson, The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar, 4-5. At the Metropolitan Museum, Muscarella was Assistant Curator (1964-1969), Associate Curator (1969-1978), and then Senior Research Fellow, retiring in 2009. He continued to work at Hasanlu, as well as other Iranian sites including Dinkha Tepe, Nush-i Jan, and Sé Girdan; he also discovered what he believed to be the important Urartian city of Qalatgah. He was appointed acting head of the department in late 1970 and early 1971, outspoken about the museum’s acquisitions policies with respect to antiquities in light of the recent UNESCO convention, which opened for signature in November 1970. On August 30, 1972, he received his first notice of termination from the museum. This began a years-long legal battle between Muscarella and The Met concerning his wrongful termination, which was eventually resolved with his full reinstatement as Senior Research Fellow in 1978.Simpson, The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar, 6-14.  Fight against the antiquities trade  Muscarella sees the collecting of illegal antiquities by individuals and institutions as harmful to the discipline of archaeology. It is now widely recognized that the illegal antiquities trade increases the value of and demand for important artifacts, which creates incentives for the plunder of sites, and encourages the production of forgeries. Since looters do not document their digging, as occurs with scientific excavation, their activities end up destroying the archaeological context of the artifacts they uncover. Large parts of cultural history, it is claimed, have been destroyed in this manner.Barbara T. Hoffman, Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy and Practice (Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 3. According to Muscarella, museums have been complicit in \\"bazaar archeology,” and have fabricated proveniences for objects that have been illegally excavated or forged.Oscar White Muscarella, Archaeology, Artifacts, and Antiquities of the Ancient Near East: Sites, Cultures, and Proveniences, Google Books (Leiden: Brill, 2013), 890. He has alleged that curators are often hesitant to address awkward questions about objects in their collections that have been acquired by purchase, donation, or loan for exhibition. The problems are outlined in Muscarella’s 1977 article on the Ziwiye hoard, \\"'Ziwiye’ and Ziwiye: The Forgery of a Provenience,” where he points out that none of the items were excavated under archaeological conditions, but appeared on the art market and passed through the hands of dealers. He concludes that \\"there are no objective sources of information that any of the attributed objects actually were found at Ziwiye, although it is probable that some were,\\" and that “the objects have no historical and archaeological value as a group.\\"Oscar White Muscarella, \\"'Ziwiye' and Ziwiye: The Forgery of Provenience,\\" Journal of Field Archaeology 4 (1979): 197; reprint, Oscar White Muscarella, ‘’Archaeology, Artifacts, and Antiquities of the Ancient Near East,’’ 955.  Forgeries  Muscarella has gained some notoriety in his attempts to unmask certain important artifacts as forgeries, including some in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His book ‘‘The Lie Became Great. The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures’’ (2000) includes a long catalogue of specific objects in museums, private collections, and the art market that he claims are modern forgeries. He has even assessed whole categories of objects to be forgeries.James Gardner, \\"Met Fakes Unearthed?\\" ‘‘The New York Post’’ February 1, 2001. The book was well-received by reviewers in academic journals, several of whom concluded that it should be \\"required\\" or \\"compulsory\\" reading for those in the field.See: David W. J. Gill, review of The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures, American Journal of Archaeology 107, no. 2 (April 2003): 285-286. Gill asserts, \\"The Lie should be compulsory reading for any archaeologist who has ever had to deal with material which has not been derived from an archaeological excavation\\"; see also Lucille A. Roussin, Journal of Field Archaeology, vol. 29, no. 3/4 (2002), 494-496, and Morag M. Kersel, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, no. 335 (August 2004), 101-103. In 2003 he was reported in The Times of London, in a story by Peter Watson, to have \\"labelled as mostly fake\\" the Oxus Treasure in the British Museum.Peter Watson, \\"All that glisters isn't old\\", The Times, December 19, 2003. As a result, he was attacked in a letter to The Times by then Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Philippe de Montebello, who said that Muscarella, as a long-standing critic of museums' tolerance and even encouragement of the trade in illegal antiquities, had only remained at the museum because of the \\"exigencies of academic tenure.” De Montebello was himself criticized for suppressing debate.\\"The Metropolitan and the Oxus Treasure\\", ArtWatch, January 5, 2004; see also: Philippe de Montebello, \\"The Oxus Treasure: From the Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\\" The Times, December 26, 2003. De Montebello writes in the opening paragraph of his letter, \\"I am frankly astonished by the unofficial comments about the Oxus Treasure at the British Museum from someone you call 'a distinguished archaeologist' at the Metropolitan, but who is someone whom we have marginalized within our museum.\\" In an article on the Oxus Treasure published in 2003, Muscarella attacked the assumed unity of the treasure and the narratives of its provenience, and questioned the authenticity of some of the votive plaques.Muscarella, Archaeology, Artifacts, and Antiquities of the Ancient Near East, 969.

Biography  Konstantin Sergeyevich Badygin began his naval career in 1928 as a sailor on Soviet ships in the Pacific Ocean. Later he studied in the Marine Technical School at Vladivostok and became a navigator and an officer in the Soviet Navy. Between 1935 and 1936 he became the third officer aboard Icebreaker Krasin and in 1937 he became the second in command aboard Icebreaker Sedov'. Badygin became renowned in 1938 as captain of icebreaker Sedov when it was transformed into a Soviet Drifting Polar Station. In 1940 Badigin was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his work aboard the Sedov as both a naval officer and a scientist. Between 1941 and 1943 he became the Chief of the Soviet ice-breaker fleet in the White Sea as well as the director of the Ice Survey Service. In 1944 and 1945 he became the captain of merchant liner Clara Zetkin which plied the Vladivostok-Seattle route. After the end of World War II Badigin asked to be relieved of active service owing to health reasons. Then he became an author and wrote three autobiographical works, as well as historical novels. He continued writing until his death in 1984. Soviet Polar Station \\"Sedov\\" In the summer of 1937 Icebreaker Sadko sailed from Murmansk. Its original goal was to sail to Henrietta, Zhokhov, and Jeanette Islands, in the De Long group and carry out scientific research. The purpose of the expedition was also to find out how could the Northern Sea Route be used for regular shipping. But the Soviet naval authorities changed the plans and the ice-breaker was sent instead to help ships in distress in the Kara and Laptev Seas. Konstantin Badygin on the upper left The Sadko, however, became itself trapped in fast ice at 75°17'N and 132°28'E in the region of the New Siberian Islands. Two other Soviet icebreakers, the Sedov and the Malygin, both in the same area researching the ice conditions, became trapped by sea ice as well and drifted helplessly. Owing to persistent bad weather conditions, part of the stranded crew members and some of the scientists could only be rescued in April 1938. And only on 28 August 1938, could Yermak free two of the three ships at 83°4'N and 138°22'E. The third ship, Sedov, had to be left to drift in its icy prison and was transformed into a scientific polar station. It kept drifting northwards in the ice towards the Pole, very much like Fridtjof Nansen's Fram had done in 1893–96. There were 15 crew aboard, led by Captain Konstantin Badygin and W. Kh. Buinitzki. The scientists aboard took 415 astronomical measurements, 78 electromagnetic observations, as well as 38 depth measurements by drilling the thick polar ice during their 812-day stay aboard the Sedov. Finally they were freed between Greenland and Svalbard by icebreaker Joseph Stalin on 18 January 1940. Captain Badygin, as well as the crew and scientists were welcomed back in the Soviet Union as heroes. Later Captain Konstantin Badygin was awarded the Order of the Red Star and became a hero of the Soviet Union.

The contest was announced at the Paris Motor Show in 2000, and culminated in the winning design being built by Peugeot, and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2001. Since then, the contest has followed a similar schedule every two years. For the 2006-2007 contest, the winning design featured in an Xbox 360 game.

In 2008, the contest opened in June, with the deadline for submissions on July 20. When the deadline for submissions has passed, Peugeot selects 30 entries to go forward to the next stage. These 30 entries are placed on the competition's website and are voted on by visitors to the site and selected industry and press figures. Based on these votes, these 30 entries are narrowed down to ten entries and these entries are posted to the website. This stage is not a majority vote - the ten entries which are selected may not be the highest-voted entries.

BWS is an initialism for Beer, Wine, Spirits. BWS is the largest liquor retailer in Australia with 1355 stores nationally. Founding  BWS began operations in June 2001 as a local neighbourhood bottleshop. BWS is a brand of Woolworth's Endeavour Drinks Group which also includes Dan Murphy's, Cellarmasters and Pinnacle Liquor. The Freestanding Liquor Division of Woolworths was distinguished from the former Woolworths Liquor and Safeway Liquor stores (Victoria), in that it stands alone from Supermarkets. The first BWS was opened in Cabramatta, New South Wales, the site of a Woolworths owned Mac's Liquor Store. In 2012 Woolworths Liquor and BWS are to share all promotions, prices and specials between the two brands. This was a first step towards re-branding all Woolworths Liquor stores to BWS. These stores now operate as free standing stores, financially and managerially separate from the supermarkets. They do, however, remain adjacent to Woolworths Supermarkets, although a handful are known to be adjacent to Coles Supermarkets, such as in Mount Warren Park, Queensland. As of June 2014, BWS has over 1,200 stores Australia wide, a majority including the ALH Group sites. They recently have been buying and converting independent liquor stores such as Darlinghurst Cellars along Oxford Street near Hyde Park, Sydney. BWS owns several beer brands including John Boston, Tun, Arc Valley and Sail & Anchor through Pinnacle Drinks.http://www.pinnacleliquor.com.au/ As of 2017, BWS has over 1,300 stores Australia wide.

DRI documents conditions, publishes reports, and promotes international oversight of the rights of persons with disabilities. DRI was founded in 1993 by attorney Eric Rosenthal and jointly established by the Washington College of Law Center for Human Rights and the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Since 1993, DRI has expanded offices into 3 countries including Serbia, Mexico, and Ukraine. On June 27, 2009, MindFreedom International, announced that Laurie Ahern had been named president of DRI. As a result of DRI's work: * Brought about worldwide recognition of disability rights as international human rights * Documented abuses and supported activists in 25 countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East * Helped to draft the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, recently signed by President Obama and ratified by more than 70 countries * Exposed and closed abusive institutions and fostered the creation of human and dignified services, allowing people with disabilities to live in the community * Eradicated the use of cages in several countries where children and adults with disabilities were imprisoned for yearsUsed international human rights legal systems to protect the human rights of people with disabilities * Stopped the use of unmodified ECT (shock treatment without anesthesia) in Turkey to which more than 15,000 children and adults were subject every year * Pressured the European Union (EU) to add disability rights to the EU's human rights considerations for EU membershipCreated disability advocacy movements in countries where there were none * Succeeded in including protection for children and adults with disabilities, warehoused and abused for a lifetime, under the United Nations Convention Against Torture Reports and press coverage Since its founding, DRI has published reports on conditions and experiences of persons with disabilities including: * Human Rights and Mental Health: Uruguay (1995) * Human Rights and Mental Health: Hungary (1997) * Human Rights and Mental Health, Mexico (2000) * Human Rights of People with Mental Disabilities, Kosovo (2002) * Human RIghts and Mental Health in Peru (2004) * Behind Closed Doors: Human Rights Abuses in the Psychiatric Facilities, Orphanages and Rehabilitation Centers of Turkey (2005) * Hidden Suffering: Romania's Segregation and Abuse of Infants and Children with Disabilities (2006) * Ruined Lives: Segregations from Society in Argentina's Psychiatric Asylums (2007) * Torment Not Treatment: Serbia's Segregation and Abuse of Children and Adults with Disabilities (2007) * The Rights of Children with Disabilities in Vietnam:Bringing Vietnam's Laws into compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2009) * Torture Not Treatment:Electric Shock and Long-Term Restraint in the United States on Children and Adults with Disabilities at the Judge Rotenberg Center (2010) * Abandoned and Disappeared:Mexico's Segregation and Abuse of Children and Adults with Disabilities (2010) * Guatemala: Precautionary Measures Petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2012) * The Rights of Persons with Mental Disabilities in the new Mexican Criminal Justice System (2013) DRI has had coverage of their work by the following newspapers: New York Times, Washington Post, CNN International, BBC World Service, ABC News, Voice of America, NPR, NBC, Univision, Independent (London), Ha'Aretz and others. Moreover, DRI has an article in UNICEF's 2013 State of the World's Children Report focused on children with disabilities. Worldwide campaign to end the institutionalization of children Founded by President Laurie Ahern, DRI has led a campaign worldwide campaign to end the institutionalization of children. The goal of the Worldwide Campaign to End the Institutionalization of Children, is to challenge underlying policies that lead to abuses against children on a global scale. One of the main drivers of institutionalization – particularly in developing countries – is the use of misdirected foreign assistance funding to build new institutions or rebuild old crumbling facilities, instead of providing assistance and access to services for families who want to keep their children at home. Disability Rights International will document the role of international funders in perpetuating the segregation of children with disabilities. Findings by Disability Rights International on conditions of institutionalized children includes: – In Mexico, there is almost no official oversight of children in private institutions, and children have literally “disappeared” from public record. Preliminary evidence suggests that children with disabilities have been “trafficked” into forced labor or sex slavery; – In the United States, children with autism and other mental disabilities living at a residential school in Massachusetts are being given electric shocks as a form of “behavior modification”; – We have found children with autism in Paraguay and Uruguay locked in cages; – In Turkey, children as young as 9 years old were being given electro-shock treatments without anesthesia until we exposed the barbaric treatment; – In Romania, we found teenagers with both mental and physical disabilities hidden away in an adult psychiatric institution – near death from intentional starvation. Some of the teens weighed less than 30 pounds; – In Russia, we uncovered thousands of neglected infants and babies in the “lying down rooms,” where row after row of babies with disabilities both live and die in their cribs.– In almost all institutions with children, we find them rocking back and forth, chewing their fingers or hands or gouging at their eyes or hitting themselves – all attempts to feel something rather than nothing and a reaction to total sensory deprivation and a lack of human love or contact. International policy advocacy  DRI has advocated extensively in over 25 countries. Primarily, DRI has focused on: * Promoting worldwide recognition of abuse as torture * Recognition of international disability rights in the United States * Promoting the CRPD in international oversight and enforcement systems * Working to end international support for new institutions and segregated service systems Women’s rights initiative DRI's Women's Rights Initiative focuses on challenging the “double discrimination,” women with disabilities face—both because of their gender and disability. DRI documents and exposes abuses against this population, sensitizes government authorities and civil society organizations about the importance of addressing disability from a gender perspective, and works with women's rights groups to encourage them to include a disability perspective in their agenda. DRI's recent work in this area includes: Mexico— DRI helped establish a Women's Committee formed by women with a psychosocial disability that belong to the Colectivo Chuhcan, Mexico's first advocacy organization run by persons with psychosocial disabilities. DRI helps empower these activists to become spokespersons for women with psychosocial disabilities at the local and national level. Guatemala— After documenting sexual abuse and trafficking of women and girls with disabilities in a Guatemalan psychiatric hospital, DRI filed a petition with before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The IACHR ordered Guatemala to take urgent measures to protect the women detained in this facility. DRI is currently working with the Guatemalan government to ensure that an end is brought to the sexual abuse and trafficking against women and girls. Ukraine— Ukraine's local office focuses on the rights of women and children who are institutionalized or at-risk of institutionalization. DRI has documented numerous abuses against women in Ukraine's institutions, including: non-consensual medical abortions; forced birth control and gynecological exams; and forced separation of mothers from their children. DRI's local office in Ukraine also reaches out to and empowers women recovering from eating disorders—a population which is at high-risk for psychiatric institutionalization. Serbia controversy Notably, in November 2007, DRI released a controversial report on conditions in psychiatric institutions in Serbia. DRI's report, which showed pictures of emaciated children and adults tied to beds, called many of the abuses \\"tantamount to torture.\\" On an NBC News report before the report released, a Serbian official admitted that problems existed. Following the release of the report, however, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the allegations raised as \\"malicious.\\" Five days after the report released, members of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture arrived to assess the problem of abuse in mental institutions in Serbia. Serbian government representatives promised to improve conditions in Serbian institutions.Report: conditions harsh for disabled in Serbia (SETimes.com) Awards Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards (2013) Laurie Ahern, President of DRI received the prestigious award given by Viscardi center to exceptional leaders in the field of disability activism. Charles Bronfman Award (2013) DRI was awarded the Charles Bronfman Award recognizing DRI's work in awakening the world's conscience to protect the human rights of children and adults with disabilities; documenting the segregation and abusive treatment of people with disabilities in dozens of countries; training and inspiring disability and human rights activists; and appealing to governments and world bodies to protect a vulnerable and overlooked population.

Soon afterwards, he was unsuccessful in trying the first renal xenotransplantation (cross-species transplant) between a goat and a dog. Following an unsuccessful attempt to transplant a pig's kidney into a human patient, who was in the final stage of renal disease, he stopped research of kidney transplantation.

They came from everywhere to escape religious and political persecution and war. Many just wanted a better life and the \\"American Dream\\". The Ellis Island Hospital was a 750-bed facility which treated over 1.2 million patients, 250,000 immigrants were treated for illnesses such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, trachoma and other contagious diseases. Over 350 babies were born there. It has been estimated that one third of Americans today can trace at least one ancestor’s entry into the United States through Ellis Island.McGeehan, Patrick. “Final Stop for Thousands Of Ellis Island Immigrants Is Reopening After Repairs.” New York Times. 2 Apr 2007. In 2001, Save Ellis Island entered into an agreement with the National Park Service to coordinate fundraising activities and oversee the historic preservation of Ellis Island.  Reopening of unrestored Ellis Island buildings  A public tour of the south side Shuttered for 60 years, Ellis Island's South Side Hospital Complex was opened to visitors for the first time on October 1, 2014, revealing an overlooked story in immigration to the United States. Approximately one immigrant out of ten who arrived at Ellis Island received medical attention at this facility. In its day, the 29-building complex was the largest U.S. Public Health Service Institution in the United States. Ill and infirm immigrants were treated and cured within its walls before being allowed to enter the country. Approximately 1.2 million of the 12 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island received medical treatment at what may have been the most modern, comprehensive hospital in the nation. This facility included wards for obstetrics, mental health and contagious diseases. It had laundry facilities and even a morgue. Save Ellis Island, in partnership with the National Park Service (NPS), raised funds to stabilize and partially restore several of the hospital complex buildings.  First building  New Ferry Building before renovation The south side of the island is dominated by the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, whose restoration began in 2000.

Built in 1892, then reconstructed in 2015, it is of the oldest, and the largest Vaishnavite temple in Malaysia, it is often referred to as the \\"Thirupathi of South East Asia\\" after its famous namesake in India. It is the first granite temple in Malaysia. The temple is the most popular temple of lord Vishnu in South East Asia. The temple is located in the royal town of Klang, and is just a stone's throw away from the popular Little India in Klang. This temple is dedicated to the Lord Vishnu in the form of Perumal (also known as Thirumaal), a very popularly worshipped form by southern Indians. Architecture The Gopuram of this temple is one of the great landmarks of Klang, which stands proudly along Persiaran Raja Muda Musa. It shows many sculptures and carvings of different deities, representing many epics in simple image form. Inside the temple, there are several complexes dedicated to different deities. At the center of the temple is the Perumal Sannathi, where Lord Perumal and His consort Goddess Mahalakshmi are situated. The center complex of Lord Perumal Sannathi contains a small gopuram with the statue of all Lord Vishnu’s avatars surrounding it. On the right of the Perumal Sannathi is the Shivan Sannathi, which consists Lord Shiva, Lord Parvathi, Lord Vinayagar, Lord Muruga and Lord Ayyappan. On the left side of Perumal Sannathi is Saneshwara Sannathi, where Lord Shani and the Navagrahas is situated. Adjacent to the center complex is Lord Anjaneya Sannathi and just at the corner outside the temple is Lord Nagaraja Sannathi. The temple also has a multi-purpose hall called The Mahalakshami Kalyana Mandapam (Mahalakshmi Wedding Hall), a favourite place of the Indian community in Klang to have their weddings. The entire space of this temple is befitted with air-cool system for the convenience of devotees. Sri Sunderaraja Perumal Temple is now in the process of undergoing major renovations to restructure the temple area. It is planned to commence around November 2010 and end by 2014, with all the painstaking effort by the present temple president, Mr. S. Ananda Krishna. Festivals Various religious and spiritual activities are held in Klang Perumal temple all year long. But the most prominent of it is the Purataasi month celebration, the month dedicated to Lord Perumal. It is the month that falls between mid-September to mid-October, where many devotees of Perumal take strict vows to achieve spiritual conscience. Month long prayers and rituals are held everyday and Saturdays of this holy month is celebrated grandly in festival mood. Devotees from all over Malaysia and even the neighbouring countries throng to this temple from morning to night to pay their homage and have the grace of Lord Sri Sunderaraja Perumal. The temple is also particularly packed on Vaikunta Ekadasi, Tamil New Year and Deepavali with devotees eager to offer their prayers on the holy day. Contributions Apart from its religious duties, the temple is also very active in serving its responsibility towards the society. On Saturdays, the free lunch program is held where lunch is cooked and sent to many less-privileged homes around the Klang district. Furthermore, it also arranges hospital visits from time to time to help the sick and benefit the public. Awards and recognition Recently, on November 2006, the temple was awarded with ISO 9001:2000 certification for its quality sustained contribution in religious, cultural and social service to Hindus. This is probably the first Hindu shrine in the world to receive an international quality service acknowledgement. References * Sankara Subramaniam. Temple In Selangor First To Achieve ISO 9001:2000.

Established in 1855, it's principally an agricultural event which focuses on the primary industries of Victoria, and rural lifestyle of many Victorians with events such as livestock judging, equestrian events, animal breeders competitions, produce competitions and wood chopping, although it also incorporates live entertainment, sporting events, food tasting, and fashion shows. A popular feature of the show is the sideshows which feature showrides, foodstalls, games of skill, and showbag stalls. Unlike its capital-city counterpart, the Royal Melbourne Show, over recent years the Royal Geelong Show has maintained its agricultural focus, with displays of many classes of animals, and has a carnival atmosphere. The show runs for four days, from Thursday through to Sunday, ending on the third Sunday in October. The Saturday is known as family day and usually involves many discounts and savings on showbags and rides. There were no shows in 1917-18, 1942-44, and 2020 because of the Great War, World War II, and the COVID-19 pandemic respectively.

Later, King Charles III of Spain transformed it into a Theological Seminary (1777). The first lecture rooms about Economics and Physics were founded here by father Felix Varela in 1813 and many students went to learn this and other new subject matters. The School had a lab and other facilities and it became even more important than the University at least until the 1840s.

Grimm specialised in documenting historical scenes and events; he also illustrated books such as Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. Life and work Country Fair in France 1765 Early Life and training in Bern and Paris Grimm was born in 1733 in Burgdorf, a town situated to the north-east of Bern in Switzerland. Initially Grimm aspired to be a poet and in 1762 published a volume of poems. Shortly before 1760 Grimm moved to Bern and studied under Johann Ludwig Aberli who had taken over a drawing school that had previously been run by his uncle Johann Rudolf Grimm.“Hauptmann” (2014), pg.14, Aberli specialised in topographical scenery, particularly of the Swiss Alps and he also patented a technique using faint outline etching for the mass production of these views. Grimm supplied drawings which were used to illustrate Friedrich von Hagedorn's Poetische Werke which was published between 1769 and 1772. Grimm worked for Aberli until 1765, when at the age of 32, he moved to Paris to study under Johann Georg Wille who was a member of the Académie royal de peinture et de sculpture and Graveur de Roi. Under Wille, was able to greatly expand his skill as landscape and topographical artist. Surviving work shows that he made sketching trips in the Bois de Boulogne, Normandy and Picardy. At this time he perfected his skills as watercolour artist and a recorder of historic buildings. About March 1768, Grimm left Paris for London.

In 1775 Grimm was known to be in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, and by 1778 was working in London.

Another example of a unique artistic recording is the 1790 ink-wash drawing he produced of the chapel at Calcot Manor in Gloucestershire, long since ruined, and a drawing of Samuel Pegge's church which was later rebuilt after a fire. He also made a number of drawings of the body of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln when his coffin was opened.

Burrell gave Grimm's Sussex collection in 1796, whilst Sir Richard bequeathed his collection of Grimm's art to the British Museum in 1810.

The game was released on UMD in Japan on January 9, 2010, in North America on September 7, 2010, and in the PAL regions on September 10, 2010. An international version of the game titled Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix was released in Japan in January 2011 featuring the changes made in the non-Japanese versions. A direct sequel, Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep - A Fragmentary Passage, was released in January 2017 as a part of a bundle of games called Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. The game utilizes an overhauled battle system different from previous games in the series with new elements. It is a prequel to the original Kingdom Hearts, taking place ten years before. The game centers on the journeys of Terra, Aqua and Ventus, characters briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II in their quest to locate the missing Master Xehanort, and protect the worlds from creatures known as the Unversed. The player has access to the three characters' different scenarios when playing. Development of the game began in June 2005 with parts of the game Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix meant to bring clues of Birth by Sleep. The game was directed by Tetsuya Nomura and co-directed by Tai Yasue. Nomura has referred to the game as \\"Episode 0\\" (and later \\"Episode 0.1\\" following the release of Kingdom Hearts χ) saying that the game is on the same scale and plays as a large a role in the series as Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. The game has been well-received, selling 1.27 million copies worldwide as of November 2010, and receiving positive comments by video game publications. Critics praised the gameplay, graphics, music, and storyline of the game, with criticism reserved for the level design and the characters. A high definition version of the Final Mix edition was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2014, PlayStation 4 in 2017, and Xbox One in February 2020 as a part of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection. Gameplay Terra battling the Trinity Armor with Aqua and Ventus. Birth by Sleep is an action role-playing game with hack and slash elements that introduces a gameplay aspect to the series called the Command System. This system allows players to customize a Command Deck with techniques and abilities that they can perform at will, called Deck Commands. Performing ordinary attacks and Commands fills a gauge displayed above the Command Deck. When certain requirements are fulfilled and the gauge is full, the player's basic attack is changed to the \\"Surge\\" Command, which racks up powerful combos depending on what Command Style is activated. Filling the gauge a second time replaces the \\"Surge\\" Command with the more powerful \\"Storm\\" Command. Unlike previous games in the series, the game does not utilize Magic Points (MP) for spells or magic casting. It instead uses a system known as Focus, which is displayed in an orange gauge on the interface. The player can use Focus to perform a technique called Shotlock with which the player enters a first person mode where they target enemies to cast homing spells that differ with each character and technique, depleting the gauge relative to the number of enemies targeted. Once depleted, the Focus gauge gradually refills with every attack and Deck Command the player lands on an enemy. Another aspect introduced in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, similar to that of the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally. The game also features the Command Board, which appears whenever the player completes a world, and can be accessed from save points and the world map once unlocked. Each world has its own unique Command Board with its own tricks and mechanisms. The Command Board plays like a simplified version of the Fortune Street board game series. A die is thrown and the player moves, with each space having its own unique effect on the player. Various Disney characters from throughout the game also appear on their respective Command Board to either aid or hinder the player. Special panels in the board game can trigger \\"special events\\" when landed on by the player. Scenarios The game is divided into three separate scenarios, with each one surrounding the story of the three main characters: Terra, Aqua and Ventus. While the first ten minutes of the story are the same regardless of which character is chosen, the events that follow differ in each scenario, with each character's narrative occurring parallel to the others and intersecting with one another at different points. The gameplay of each scenario differs based on the abilities of each character such as their power, speed and magic: Terra is the most powerful in terms of physical damage, Ventus is the fastest character and Aqua specializes in magic. Players may choose which of the three scenarios they wish to start with near the beginning of the game. The recommended scenario order of play by Nomura is Terra, followed by Ventus, and lastly Aqua, allowing the player to best understand the story. Completing all three scenarios will unlock the story's final chapter. Multiplayer The game supports up to six players at a time in four new multiplayer modes, all set in a world known as the Mirage Arena. In each mode, players control one of the three main characters. In Versus, players fight against each other in a deathmatch-style game, while in Arena players fight co-operatively in a \\"Survival Mode\\" style of gameplay against wave after wave of Unversed. Rumble Racing features players racing against each other competitively on their Keyblade vehicles, which can also be used to attack rivals. Command Board is a board game using the in-game Command Board mechanic, where players try to reach the end first as in traditional board games. Setting records in the Mirage Arena earns players medals which can be exchanged for rare items in-game. Only Ad-Hoc wireless multiplayer, where all of the players need to be physically near each other, is allowed. Plot=Setting Birth by Sleep is a prequel set ten years prior to the first Kingdom Hearts game. Like the other games in the series, the player progresses through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from Peter Pan and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various new worlds specially created for the series by Square Enix such as the Land of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town that surrounds the castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear in the form of cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts. Characters The three main characters are Terra, Aqua, and Ventus, a trio of Keyblade apprentices under Master Eraqus who aspire to become Masters themselves. Another Keyblade Master, Xehanort, and his apprentice, Vanitas, serve as the game's antagonists. Other characters from the previous games return, such as younger versions of Sora, Riku, and Kairi, though they are given less prominent roles. A number of characters who later come to form Organization XIII also appear in their human forms. As with the Heartless in Kingdom Hearts and the Nobodies in Kingdom Hearts II, Birth by Sleep introduces a new type of enemy: the Unversed, fledgling emotions that are \\"not well-versed in their own existences\\" and feed on negativity. As with the other games in the series, Birth by Sleep features an extensive cast of Disney characters. The most prominent of these characters is Mickey Mouse, the king of Disney Castle, who serves as a Keyblade apprentice under the sorcerer Yen Sid at this point in the series chronology. Donald Duck and Goofy, who assist Sora in most other games, appear in smaller roles. Most other Disney characters remain in their respective worlds regardless of their overall importance to the story in previous installments, such as Maleficent and Pete, who served as major antagonists between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, and a number of the Princesses of Heart. Some characters (such as Experiment 626, Prince Phillip, and Mickey) occasionally fight alongside the player characters in battles as partners similar to the other games, providing assistance and performing combos to help the player proceed. However, they do not follow the player around constantly like Donald and Goofy in the other games. Unlike the other major installments, which also featured casts of various characters throughout the Final Fantasy series, Birth by Sleep only features two of these characters: Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII, and the Moogles, creatures from several of the Final Fantasy games, who sell items to the player. As Birth by Sleep is a prequel of the first Kingdom Hearts title, the staff decided to add Zack to the title as he is the protagonist of the Final Fantasy VII prequel, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Story Master Xehanort brings a comatose Ventus to the Destiny Islands after the latter's heart is damaged; a newborn heart senses Ventus's heart and connects with it, saving him. Years later, at the Land of Departure, Terra and Aqua take an exam to achieve the Mark of Mastery. Xehanort manipulates the exam so Terra fails while Aqua passes, lessening Terra's control of the darkness in his heart. Shortly afterward, Xehanort disappears and a horde of Unversed appear throughout the worlds. Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds. Meanwhile, Vanitas convinces Ventus to follow Terra against Eraqus's wishes, while Eraqus orders Aqua to monitor Terra's darkness and bring Ventus back to the Land of Departure. As the three travel through several worlds, Terra attracts the attention of several villains, who offer him the whereabouts of Xehanort in exchange for assistance in their own agendas. He eventually finds Xehanort, who offers to take him in as his apprentice and urges him to use his inner darkness to gain power. He further instructs him to destroy Vanitas, the source of the Unversed, who was created from the darkness extracted from Ventus's heart. Shortly afterward, the three friends reunite at Radiant Garden, but a schism forms between them when they have an argument over Terra's presumed actions in the other worlds. Ventus encounters Xehanort, who reveals his intention to recombine Ventus and Vanitas's hearts to create an all-powerful Keyblade called the χ-blade. Xehanort sends Ventus to the Land of Departure to confront Eraqus, who attempts to destroy Ventus to foil Xehanort's plan. Terra arrives to save Ventus and fights with Eraqus; upon his defeat, Eraqus is vanquished by Xehanort, who enshrouds the Land of Departure in darkness and tells Terra to go to a world known as the Keyblade Graveyard. Ventus is instructed to do the same by Vanitas, as is Aqua by Yen Sid upon being informed of Eraqus's demise at Xehanort and Terra's hands. Terra, Aqua, and Ventus reunite at the Keyblade Graveyard, where Xehanort and Vanitas reveal their plan to use the χ-blade to unlock Kingdom Hearts and start a Keyblade War, an apocalyptic event that nearly destroyed the world in the past. Terra's heart is swallowed by darkness in the ensuing battle, and Xehanort takes over his body to replace his own aging one. However, Terra's mind remains within his discarded suit of armor, which comes to life and defeats Xehanort. Meanwhile, Ventus is forced to fuse with Vanitas to create the χ-blade. Aqua and Mickey fight with the possessed Ventus and destroy the χ-blade, while Ventus engages and defeats Vanitas in a metaphysical battle within his own mind, losing his heart and falling into a catatonic state as a result. After learning of Ventus's condition from Yen Sid, Aqua brings his body to the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. At Radiant Garden, Aqua battles the possessed Terra. When Terra struggles for control of his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, becoming trapped in the process. Ansem the Wise finds an amnesiac Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus's heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora, the newborn who had previously saved him on the islands. In the game's secret ending, which takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts II, Aqua meets Ansem in the realm of darkness and learns from him about Sora, who has the power to save those connected to his heart. Sora has learned of Terra, Ventus, and Aqua's fates from a letter sent by Mickey, and undertakes another quest to save them. Development Development of the game began in June 2005 and was originally intended for the PlayStation 2 with Sora as the prototype protagonist of the game. Birth by Sleep was developed by Square Enix's fifth Product Development Division, based in Osaka, the same team behind Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories, and uses the same graphical engine as both Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and Dissidia Final Fantasy. During development of Kingdom Hearts II, the Osaka-based team had requested to be involved in a spin-off if one were to be made. Development of the game began before the release of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+. The plot was completed, but development was halted six months after it began due to development of Re:Chain of Memories. When development resumed, the team changed the platform to the PlayStation Portable so as to make use of the PSP's functions such as co-operative and competitive multiplayer gameplay. The title of the game is based on II Final Mixs secret ending, \\"Birth by Sleep\\", a title which director Tetsuya Nomura developed as he wanted a phrase having \\"by\\" as well as to use an English title like previous games. Nomura has referred to the game as \\"Episode 0\\", saying that the game is on the same scale and plays as big an importance as Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Early during the game's development, Nomura already had various scenes in mind such as Terra's and Riku's conversation in order to explain the latter's ability in the original games. Various parts from the plot had to be modified to make the game more light-hearted such as Eraqus' death at the hands of Xehanort after being defeated by Terra, how Aqua's scenario was supposed to end with her already trapped in the Realm of Darkness, and the relationship between Ventus and Sora. Two of the newly introduced protagonists, Ventus and Terra, were based on other characters from the franchise while Aqua's design did not have a base. Nevertheless, the three wear outfits meant to expand the student-and- teacher bond shown in the game. The Disney worlds were chosen to expand the characters of the Princesess of Light as well as Maleficient's who are connected with the events of the first Kingdom Hearts game, while the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space were chosen to add variety to the game, and Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts. Birth by Sleep was directed by Nomura and co- directed by Tai Yasue. It was announced alongside Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts coded at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20, 2007, where a trailer was shown in a photo-prohibited theater. New trailers were shown at the 2008 Jump Festa in December 2007 and the DKΣ3713 Private Party, an invite- only event by Square Enix for fans, in August 2008; a playable demo was also available at DKΣ3713. The June 5, 2009 issue of Famitsu covered an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, where he said that the game was, at the time, at the voice recording stage. Nomura also confirmed in an interview that Birth by Sleep would contain a secret ending like in Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II for the next game in the Kingdom Hearts series, which he confirmed to be a main game and the one which Nomura stated would link up Birth by Sleep, 358/2 Days and coded. He also confirmed that a Birth by Sleep demo would indeed be playable at the 2009 Tokyo Games Show together with a new trailer. In early October 2009, Nomura revealed that the concept of the Command Board originated from when he was in elementary school as at that time he was very fascinated with board games and even made his own; hence he wanted to incorporate a fun board game into the game. In late October 2009, Nomura revealed that he was currently designing the cover art for Birth by Sleep as well as editing the staff rolls due to there being three main characters in the game. He also revealed that they were editing the new opening movie for the game. As with coded and 358/2 Days, Yoko Shimomura, the series' main composer, composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. Like Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories, Birth by Sleep uses Hikaru Utada's theme song \\"Hikari\\" for the Japanese version and its English version, \\"Simple and Clean\\", in the other releases. The game made its final public appearance before its Japanese release at Jump Festa 2010 on December 19, 2009 where a playable demo as well as new footage from the game were present and shown. Like previous console titles in the series, the game contains a secret movie at the end, which had been described as being more like a \\"true ending\\" rather than a teaser for the future like previous ones. Development of the movie began in October where Nomura noted in the blog that the game would contain a teaser to the next major Kingdom Hearts game similar to the teasers in previous games in the series. Reception The game sold very well during its first two days of release with over 500,000 copies of the game sold in Japan. By February 14, just over a month later, the game had sold a total of 800,551 copies. Sales in North America and Europe have also been good, with the game taking high places in various categories. After its release in the United States, it was listed as the sixth bestselling video game there in September 2010 by the NPD Group. By November 2010, the game had sold 1.27 million units worldwide with 310,000 and 190,000 copies coming from North America and Europe, respectively, and the rest from Japan. In November 2011, Sony announced Birth by Sleep would receive the \\"Gold Prize\\" for selling over 500,000 units in Japan. Prior to the game's release, IGN expressed their excitement at the release of the game in 2010 having played the demo. 1UP.com echoed similar statements, praising the visuals and stating it \\"plays better\\" than the previous Kingdom Hearts games. They had some complaints regarding Ven's demo due to constant jumping, but further stated that Ven's demo gave them an idea of \\"how the game is going to feel\\", and predicted the game would improve the series. 1UP also put it on their article \\"Top 10 PSP Games of 2010\\", while Gamasutra put it in their \\"The Most Anticipated Games Of 2010\\" and \\"The Most-Awaited Games Of 2009: PlayStation Portable\\" articles. IGN featured it as nominated of 2010's \\"Best of E3 Award\\" in the category Best PSP Games. GameTrailers also had praise for the new title and gave it a nomination for Best PSP Game of E3 2010. Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep has received positive reviews from gaming reviewers. The game's average score is of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, becoming the fourth highest ranking Kingdom Hearts game behind Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts II, and Kingdom Hearts III. The game has been highly praised by Japanese gaming magazine, Famitsu, whose four reviewers gave scores of 10/9/9/9, for a total of 37/40, the third-highest rated game in the Kingdom Hearts series behind Dream Drop Distance and Kingdom Hearts II. They praised the game's graphics and music, calling them \\"superb\\", as well as praising the wide variety of customization available to the players due to the three unique playable characters. It also praised the design of boss battles, calling them \\"lively and exciting\\". English websites have also given praise to the game with GameZone calling it \\"amazing title that every KH fan must play\\", finding it the best portable game from the series. RPGamer praised the \\"evolution\\" from the gameplay ever since the series' start. PlayStation: The Official Magazine (PSM) agreed calling the fighting system \\"one of the deepest, most rewarding\\" ones from the PSP. IGN called its battle system \\"unique\\", labeling it as the best one from all the series and having a campaign story. 1UP praised the differences between the protagonists' fighting styles with PSN comparing them with different classes of RPG characters. A common complaint has been the game's loading times, which tended to be very long depending on the PlayStation Portable's memory. Reviewers also called the game's worlds \\"hollow due to the lack of interaction, and also criticized the game's camera which sometimes made fights confusing. Visuals were also well received for being similar to the ones from PlayStation 2's games with praise on the design of the worlds, although a lack of details was also noted. Sites have also praised the game's story, for its accessibility as a result of being a prequel, or that it did not bear elements from previous games that tended to confuse gamers such as the characters' identities. Critics also appreciated how the story is told from three different perspectives, which helped to give different point of views as well as expand the time the game can be played. Nevertheless, some character traits were criticized such as the similarities between the protagonists to previous ones. While Eurogamer cited that the three characters had little impact to the Disney worlds' storyline, Terra's role was praised by 1UP.com for distancing itself from previous scenarios. Although the lack of Final Fantasy characters received mixed opinions, PSM thought that it helped to expand the exploration of Disney worlds, while Zack's role was found suitable by GameZone. The English casting for Birth by Sleep also received positive comments with GameTrailers stating that it \\"features one of the few good English dubs in recent memory\\", particularly Leonard Nimoy's performance. GameSpot stated that Ventus' and Aqua's voice actor to have done a good job voicing them, but criticized Terra's as one of the worst ones from the game, most notably, when compared with other well- received actors. IGN featured the game in their \\"Game of the Month\\" article series for September 2010 in the PSP category. The game has been listed as one of the best PlayStation Portable titles with GamesRadar placing it sixth and IGN eighteenth. In an ASCII Media Works poll, it was listed as the tenth best game of 2010. It won in the category of \\"Best Portable Console Videogame\\" in France's 2011 Japan Expo. Versions and merchandise Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep was also released with a limited edition PSP-3000 as a bundle in Japan featuring designs from the Kingdom Hearts series on its back. On March 16, 2010, Square Enix announced the English version of the game, which was released on September 7, 2010 in North America, and on September 10, 2010 in Europe. The English version of the game contains some adjustments from the original version, such as a new difficulty setting called Critical Mode, and additional songs for the Ice Cream Beat minigame. A new boss known only as the Unknown appears in the overseas versions, as well as a new gameplay element called \\"Crown Stickers\\", which act much the same way as the Puzzle Pieces from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix. The game also has a notable voice-acting cast of returning members such as Jesse McCartney and James Woods, as well as numerous new actors such as Willa Holland, Jason Dohring, Leonard Nimoy, and Mark Hamill. An Ultimania guidebook of the game was released on March 25, 2010. Like previous games, a light novel of Birth by Sleep has been written by Tomoko Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. Its first volume, \\"Something Strange\\" was published by Square Enix on December 24, 2010, the second - \\"Best Friends\\" - on February 24, 2011, and the third and final volume, \\"To the Future\\", on May 26, 2011. Additionally, the tracks featured in the game have been released as part of a three-disc album which includes the soundtracks from Birth by Sleep, 358/2 Days and coded. Final Mix In early 2010, Nomura was asked in an interview if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated that one of the main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the staff would think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which takes place after the events of the final episode, and also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi, which were later dubbed into English by Aqua's English voice actress Willa Holland for the HD 2.5 Remix release. The events of the secret episode would tie-in to the later A Fragmentary Passage release. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix. HD 2.5 Remix In the credits of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, clips of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix were shown, hinting at its inclusion in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, a second compilation exclusively for the PlayStation 3 after HD 1.5 Remix. The release includes both Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix in HD with trophy support. Additionally, the collection includes HD cinematic scenes from Kingdom Hearts Re:coded. It was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014. A Fragmentary Passage In September 2015, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. The collection features Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, a new game taking place after the events of the original Birth by Sleep, told from the perspective of Aqua. The collection also features an HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance as well as Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover, a cinematic retelling of Kingdom Hearts χ that reveals new parts of the series' history. It was released in Japan on January 12, 2017, and in other countries on January 24, 2017.

The team was an independent and played their home games in Notre Dame Stadium. Throughout the five seasons, the Irish were 35–25 and invited to three bowl games, including the school's first ever Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl. After the 1996 season, 11th-year head coach, Lou Holtz, who had led the Irish to 100 wins and a national championship, retired. The Notre Dame administration quickly named defensive coordinator, Bob Davie, as his replacement. Davie inherited a team with high expectations, and won his first game. He went onto, however, to lose his next four games. Though his team rebounded and were invited to a bowl game, he lost in his first post-season attempt and ended with a 7–6 record. His second year team returned many players and began the season ranked in the Associated Press (AP) poll. After an upset of highly ranked Michigan, the team stayed in the rankings throughout the season. With a loss in the final regular season game, though, the team lost their first chance of being invited to the BCS in its first year. The team once again lost in their bowl game and ended the season with a 9–3 record. Davie's third season started with a win, but three early losses dropped the team from the rankings. Although the team went on a four-game winning streak, they finished the season on a four-game losing streak to end with a 5–7 record and the first losing season for the Irish since 1986. Davie's fourth season looked to be as bad as his third, as the team played four ranked teams early in the season and had to replace many graduating players. However, with two wins, and an overtime loss to the top-ranked team, Nebraska, the Irish moved into the rankings again. The team ended the season on a seven-game winning streak and were invited to their first BCS bowl game. Though they lost Davie's third bowl game, he signed a contract extension after the season. Davie's fifth season began with high expectations once again. The team began ranked, but three losses to begin the season dropped the Irish from the rankings. Though the team came back and won five games, the 5–6 record was called the wrong direction by the administration, and Davie was fired. After some controversy during the hiring process, Tyrone Willingham was hired, ending Davie's era at Notre Dame. Before Davie For the 11 years before Davie, the Irish were coached by Lou Holtz. Holtz, who, it was reported, had returned the program to excellence, led the team to a national championship in 1988 and had been given, what was reported to be, a lifetime contract by Notre Dame. By his final season, 1996, Holtz had tallied 92 wins to put him third on the all-time Notre Dame wins list (only behind Ara Parseghian with 95 wins and Knute Rockne with 105 wins). Throughout the season there was speculation that Holtz, who passed Parseghian's mark, would retire rather than break Rockne's record, and on November 19, a week before his final home game at Notre Dame, it was revealed that he turned in his letter of resignation to the Notre Dame administration. In his final game at Notre Dame Stadium, where the team shut- out Rutgers 62–0, Holtz got his 100th and final win for the Irish. The Notre Dame administration didn't look far for Holtz's replacement, as their defensive coordinator, Bob Davie, who was hired by Holtz three years previous, was named as his replacement. 1997 season1998 season1999 season2000 season2001 seasonAfter Davie When Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White announced to the media that Davie would not be retained as head coach of Notre Dame, he cited a disappointing season with the Irish heading in the wrong direction on the field. A week after the firing of Davie, George O'Leary, seven–year head coach of Georgia Tech, was hired by Notre Dame for the head coaching position. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary resigned from the position, because of discrepancies on his résumé about receiving a varsity letter and a master's degree while in school. While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some said it gave Notre Dame a chance to make a better decision. Finally, two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh–year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract, ending the Bob Davie era at Notre Dame.

It is the fifth installment in the Kingdom Hearts series, and takes place near the end of the first game, continuing parallel to Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. The game was released worldwide in 2009. The story is told from the perspective of Roxas, following his daily life within Organization XIII and his relationship with fellow Organization member Axel; it also introduces a fourteenth member, Xion, who becomes friends with the former two. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was directed by Tetsuya Nomura and Tomohiro Hasegawa. Nomura decided to develop a game for the Nintendo DS, and once a system had been chosen, decided upon Roxas as the protagonist. The development team wanted to use gameplay similar to previous Kingdom Hearts games but could not due to the insufficient number of buttons the DS had. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days received generally positive response, with praise for the gameplay and graphics but criticisms of its storyline and controls. A soundtrack, various light novels, and a manga series based on the game were released in Japan. The game was dedicated to Wayne Allwine, the long time English voice of Mickey Mouse. Allwine died on May 18, 2009, 12 days before the game's release in Japan. This is also the final game to feature his performance as Mickey, though his performance was archived and reused in remastered ports of older games released after his death. Gameplay Roxas and Axel fighting a Heartless on a mission 358/2 Days features the combination of action role-playing game/hack and slash style of the previous games in the series. To accomplish this, the game makes minimal use of the system's touch screen functionality, and it is possible to play and complete the game without using it at all. The game includes single player and multiplayer modes of play. The single player mode is story-based, the player controls Roxas, who is accompanied by other Organization XIII members on daily missions to Disney worlds from the previous games. The two modes are linked in that character growth is shared between them. 358/2 Days features a new gameplay mechanic known as the panel system which involves the customization of the character's levels, items, equipment, and abilities. For example, certain magic spells cannot be used if their corresponding panels aren't equipped, but can be used consecutively if multiple are attached. Some panels also occupy multiple slots, but can be combined with other panels to form new or stronger abilities. Limit Breaks, which previously featured in Square's Final Fantasy series, can be activated during a battle once the character's health drops below a certain level, indicated by a yellow health bar. Each character has their own unique abilities during Limit Breaks which allow a temporary boost to their normal abilities, whether it be increasing the attack strength or allowing multiple enemies to be attacked at once. The second stage of a Limit Break known as Final Limit is normally a different or powered-up version of the first and begins at the point where the white line (starting at the high end of the yellow portion of the HP bar) meets top dead center. Multiplayer This is the first Kingdom Hearts game to feature cooperative multiplayer. The multiplayer gameplay is separate from the single player story and is mission- based, including cooperative and competitive player battles. Up to four players can play as one of the fourteen members of Organization XIII, with each member having different weapons, skills, and stats. Sora, Donald, Goofy, King Mickey, and Riku are featured as secret characters in the multiplayer who are unlockable while playing through the main story. 358/2 Days multiplayer also features a chat system for communication between players, but differs from PictoChat in that everyone can draw on the same screen. To prevent players missing out on multiplayer content, the games were developed so that the missions could be completed without the need to connect with other players, instead utilising AI-controlled partners. Plot=Setting Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days begins concurrently with the events of the original game and Chain of Memories. Like the other games in the series, the player progresses through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Agrabah from Aladdin; the Beast's Castle from Beauty and the Beast; Olympus Coliseum from Hercules; Halloween Town from The Nightmare Before Christmas; Wonderland from Alice in Wonderland; and Never Land from Peter Pan (featuring a string of islands new to the series rather than Captain Hook's pirate ship and Big Ben from the first game). The game also features worlds created specifically for the series by Square Enix. The most prominent world is The World That Never Was, which first appeared in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts and serves as the game's main hub, followed by Twilight Town, a frequently-explored locale. Castle Oblivion and Destiny Islands also appear in cutscenes. Characters The game revolves around Roxas, who was first featured at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II. Roxas is the Nobody of Sora, the series' protagonist, born when Sora's body vanished as he briefly lost his heart and became a Heartless. Like Sora, Roxas has the power to wield the Keyblade, a weapon normally used for battling darkness. At the start of the game, Roxas joins Organization XIII, a group of powerful Nobodies who serve as the antagonists of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II. The other members of Organization XIII play a prominent role, particularly Axel, Roxas's best friend who debuted in Chain of Memories. The game also introduces a new member: Xion, a girl resembling Kairi who, like Roxas, can wield the Keyblade. Other characters who are featured include Naminé, a girl with the power to manipulate memories; DiZ, an enigmatic man wrapped in bandages; Riku, Sora's best friend; and King Mickey, Riku's ally and ruler of Disney Castle. Sora is featured prominently in the plot, along with his allies Donald Duck and Goofy, though they appear infrequently in the form of several flashbacks and memory-induced scenarios. Also appearing are Pete, a persistent villain who first appears in Kingdom Hearts II, and Hayner, Pence, and Olette, a trio of friends living in Twilight Town who also debuted in Kingdom Hearts II. As with the other games in the series, each Disney world features several characters who appear in the films their worlds are based on; on the other hand, no Final Fantasy characters are featured apart from a Moogle managing a shop for the Organization. Story The newly born Roxas is discovered in Twilight Town by Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII, who recruits him as their thirteenth member. Unlike other Nobodies, Roxas lacks memories of his original self and develops a personality of his own as time passes. Roxas is sent on daily missions to other worlds, either alone or accompanied by a fellow member, to destroy vast quantities of Heartless and release stolen hearts with his Keyblade, which furthers the Organization's goal of creating Kingdom Hearts and becoming complete beings. Roxas is placed under the tutelage of fellow member Axel, with whom he becomes close friends. After Axel and several other members are reassigned to Castle Oblivion, Roxas partners with Xion, a fourteenth member inducted shortly after Roxas. Roxas and Xion bond over their similarities, including Xion's ability to wield a Keyblade and inability to recall her human life. Some time later, Roxas falls into a coma caused by the alteration of Sora's memories, and does not revive until several weeks later, when Axel returns from Castle Oblivion as the only survivor of the group. Over time, Xion develops a friendship with Roxas and Axel, eating sea-salt ice cream with them after missions at the Twilight Town clock tower. Xion soon falls into a coma after failing to eliminate Riku; like Roxas, she has visions of Sora after waking. In time, Xion questions her own existence, distancing herself from Roxas and Axel to learn more about herself. She eventually discovers that she is an artificial replica created as a fail-safe for Roxas, and that she has been inadvertently absorbing Sora's memories, preventing it from being completely restored. Xion is torn between staying with her friends and merging with Sora as per Riku's advice, but ultimately chooses to escape from the Organization after she begins siphoning Roxas' strength. Axel allows Xion to escape, but loses Roxas' trust. Upon learning Xion's identity from Xemnas, Roxas begins to question his own identity and defects from the Organization in search of answers, leaving Axel dejected. At Twilight Town, Roxas confronts Xion, whom Xemnas has altered to perform her initial purpose of absorbing Roxas and becoming a perfect copy of Sora. Upon being defeated, Xion's body dissipates while her heart merges with Sora's, causing all memory of her existence to gradually vanish. Returning to the World That Never Was to stop Xemnas' plan as per Xion's last request, Roxas encounters Riku, who attempts to capture him for DiZ and resume Sora's memory restoration process, which has completely halted. When Roxas overpowers him, Riku releases the darkness suppressed within his own heart, giving him the power necessary to subdue Roxas, but also giving him the physical form of Xehanort's Heartless, Ansem, who resides in his heart. DiZ inserts Roxas into a virtual simulation of Twilight Town without any of his memories of the Organization so that Roxas may eventually merge with Sora. Development 358/2 Days was developed by h.a.n.d., with Square Enix employees overseeing the process. The game was directed by Tetsuya Nomura and co-directed by Tomohiro Hasegawa. In 2007, Nomura mentioned he wanted to do a spin-off Kingdom Hearts game on a mobile platform and wanted the game to play slightly different from the other titles already in the series. 358/2 Days was announced alongside Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Kingdom Hearts coded at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20, 2007, where a trailer was shown in a photo-prohibited theater. New trailers were shown and a playable demo was available at the 2008 Jump Festa in December 2007 and the DKΣ3713 Private party in August 2008. Both single player and multiplayer demos were featured. Xion was also shown in the new trailer and in the multiplayer demo. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the system before design work on the game had begun. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. The staff thought that Roxas' role as a member of Organization XIII would be a suitable theme for the plot. This idea was furthered during the development of Kingdom Hearts II, where the staff wanted to focus on what influenced Roxas to leave the Organization, which resulted in the creation of Xion's character who was connected with Roxas' origins. The development team wanted to have gameplay similar to previous Kingdom Hearts titles, but stated the number of buttons on the Nintendo DS was a problem. Some of the DS's functions, like the stylus, are not used in order to retain the similar gameplay from previous titles. Roxas seeing Sora's memories is incorporated throughout the game and has different types of gameplay for each world. The game's logo uses warm colors as a reference to the sunset in Twilight Town. The meaning behind the title, \\"358/2 Days\\" was left unexplained by Nomura during the promotion of the game. Upon completion, the player discerns that it references the story of Xion and Roxas, and their 358 days as members of Organization XIII. Tragedy struck during development as Wayne Allwine the voice of Mickey Mouse died of complications from diabetes aged 62. Though Birth by Sleep was the first of the three new games to begin development, 358/2 Days was released before it. The game was slated for a release at the end of 2008, but Square Enix pushed the date to February 2009. Once again the game was delayed for Japanese release until May 30, 2009. A release in North American territories was announced on December 2, 2008. The official English trailer for the title was shown at Nintendo's press conference at E3 2009, confirming a release date of September 29, 2009 for North America and October 9, 2009 for Europe. 358/2 Days was originally to have featured a world based on Pinocchio, as evidenced by unused character portraits for Honest John, Gideon, Gepetto, and the eponymous character as a real boy, but this was cut due to space restrictions. Reception The game received a \\"generally favorable\\" score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic. Prior to the game's release, Nintendo Power Chris Hoffman and Steve Thomason referred to the game as highly anticipated, and considered it one of the better titles displayed at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show. The game was met with a range of reviews, ranging from mediocre to positive, where most of the focus was on the game's graphics and storyline. The graphics of the game were heavily praised by many reviewers, with Hoffman and Thomason going as far as to call them among the best on the system, and complimented the familiar feel of the gameplay and its transition between the PlayStation home consoles and the portable Nintendo ones. Game Informer gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the graphics for excellent production values and the journey of the camera controls from the PlayStation Analog Stick to the DS shoulder buttons. The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game 9/9/9/9 (36/40) and praised the graphical quality of the game saying they were at a level which had not been seen on a DS before, further complimenting the gameplay mechanics and missions. They were also particularly impressed with the new panel system which allows the player to customize their fighting techniques as well as the ability to customize the characters from the Organization. Unlike many other reviewers, they praised the story as \\"strongly captivating.\\" The Australian video game talk show Good Game two reviewers gave the game a 7/10 and 7.5/10, grateful that the game didn't force the use of the stylus, especially when it came to battle. The RPGFan reviewer gave the game an 81 out of 100, praising the visual and aural quality, however they expressed disappointment at the recycling of most of the music from Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was complimentary of the single-player mode, commenting specifically that the artificial intelligence-controlled Organization XIII members were helpful and competent. He also praised the multiplayer mode's gameplay, calling it \\"fun\\" and citing the ease of using magic spells and items. The controls and overall story were of particular criticism by the reviewers, with VanOrd stating that the on-screen character ended up in one of the game field's corners often. RPGamer was highly critical of these facts, as it handed the game a 2.5/5 score and reviewer Alex Reimer concluded, \\"...many fans of the series may be turned off by the lackluster controls and odd story directions taken with this portable spin-off.\\" The Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a mediocre score of 69% praising the graphics and gameplay, they were critical however of the constant backtracking and confusing plot. Good Games reviewers stated that while the plot was confusing, and made little sense for players new to the series, it still drew the player in and filled in the gaps of the storyline for continuing players of the series. They surmised that the repetition of worlds and missions, and overall lack of variety, combined with lengthy storytelling really hurt the gaming experience.

He was known for his honesty and willingness to advise Emperor Gaozong against actions he considered unwise. One advice he gave, however (against Emperor Gaozong's plan to let his powerful and influential wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) serving as regent due to Emperor Gaozong's illness), drew Empress Wu's resentment, and later, after she became regent over her son Emperor Ruizong after Emperor Gaozong and Hao had both died, she had Hao's clan slaughtered.  Background  Hao Chujun was born in 607, during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. His family was from what would eventually become An Prefecture (安州, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei). Late in Emperor Yang's reign, the Sui state was engulfed in agrarian rebellions, and Hao Chujun's father Hao Xianggui (郝相貴) and maternal grandfather Xu Shao (許紹), who was a Sui official, seized and controlled a significant amount of territory in modern Hubei and Chongqing. After they submitted to Tang Dynasty's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu, Hao Xianggui was created the Duke of Zengshan and made the prefect of Chu Prefecture (滁州, roughly modern Chuzhou, Anhui). When Hao Chujun was a teenager, Hao Xianggui died while still serving as prefect of Chu Prefecture, and Hao Xianggui's subordinates, pitying Hao Chujun, gathered silk and wanted to give the silk to him for his upkeep, but he declined it, an act praised by historians.See Old Book of Tang, vol. 84, and New Book of Tang, vol. 115. Hao Chujun was said to be studious in his youth; he particularly favored studying the Book of Han (the official history of the Western Han Dynasty) and was said to be able to recite it from memory.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Hao Chujun passed the imperial examination during the reign of Emperor Gaozu's son and successor Emperor Taizong and impressed the chancellor Gao Shilian in doing so. He thereafter served in the imperial administration as a scribe, and he inherited his father's title as Duke of Zengshan. He was known for having good relationships with his brothers and being respectful to his maternal uncles (one of whom, Xu Yushi, would eventually be a chancellor as well). Later, he was made a member of the staff of the Prince of Teng,Two of Emperor Taizong's brothers successively carried the title of Prince of Teng during Emperor Taizong's reign: Li Yuanyi (李元懿) (until 636) and Li Yuanying (李元嬰) (from 639 on), and so it is not clear which of the two was involved. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 64. but Hao found it dishonoring to serve as on a prince's staff, and therefore resigned. A long time thereafter, he was recalled to serve on the crown prince's staff.The context of the references in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang implies that this was during Emperor Taizong's reign, but was not explicit in doing so, and this could have been during Emperor Gaozong's reign. As Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong both had successively multiple crown princes, it is not clear whose staff Hao served on. He was eventually promoted to the post of deputy minister of civil service.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  Emperor Taizong died in 649 and was succeeded by his son and crown prince Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). He became an assistant chancellors and over time gained higher status. By 664, Empress Wu’s influence on the governance of the country had angered Emperor Gaozong so much that he had Chancellor Shangguan Yi draft an edict for her deposition. Empress Wu pleaded with Emperor Gaozong, who relented and In this purge, Hao Chujun was also somewhat reduced. Shangguan was subsequently executed and, from then on, Empress Wu would sit behind a curtain beside Emperor Gaozong and give him advice during imperial meetings and Also, most of the decision apart from the emperor's action was the responsibility of Empress Wu. Around the new year 667, Emperor Gaozong commissioned the chancellor Li Ji to command a major attack on Goguryeo, and Hao Chujun was made an assistant to Li Ji, a campaign during which Hao served with distinction. In one particular incident, Hao, who was said to be obese, was approaching a Goguryeo city when Goguryeo forces launched a surprise counterattack, causing much alarm for Hao's soldiers. Hao, who was said to be obese, did not panic, and instead pulled out a chair and sat down to eat his rations, while secretly ordering his elite troops to attack Goguryeo forces, defeating them. His calmness impressed his troops. As of 668, Hao was Dong Tai Shilang (東臺侍郎) — deputy head of the examination bureau of government (東臺, Dong Tai) — when Emperor Gaozong became convinced that a Hindu monk, Lujia Yiduo (盧迦逸多), was capable of creating medicine that would bestow immortality. He therefore commissioned Lujia as a general and was poised to take the medicine that Lujia created. Hao spoke against it, pointing out that immortality is impossible and that taking such medicine could have caused Emperor Taizong's death previously. Emperor Gaozong took his advice and did not do so. In 669, he gave Hao the designation Tong Dong Xi Tai Sanpin (同東西臺三品), making Hao a chancellor de facto. Around new year 671, when Emperor Gaozong changed the officials' titles to the ones that were used before 662, Hao's title was changed to Huangmen Shilang (黃門侍郎). At times, when Emperor Gaozong was at the eastern capital Luoyang, he would put the crown prince Li Hong in charge of the capital Chang'an, and generally, all of the chancellors remained at Chang'an to assist Li Hong, except that Hao attended to Emperor Gaozong. In 672, Hao was given the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (銀青光祿大夫) and made Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government. In 673, he was put in charge of revising the imperial records, as it was suspected that the previous lead editor, Xu Jingzong, had made many inaccurate records. In 674, during an imperial feast, for entertainment, Emperor Gaozong divided the imperial musicians into two teams and ordered that his sons Li Xián the Prince of Yong and Li Xiǎn the Prince of Zhou (note tone difference) lead the two teams in a competition. Hao, immediately argued against it: Emperor Gaozong was surprised by but agreed with Hao, and he cancelled the competition. In 675, Emperor Gaozong, suffering from a dizzying illness (may be hypertension) that caused serious headaches, considered making his powerful and influential wife Empress Wu regent and she would formally rule the empire. He consulted the chancellors, and Hao spoke against it: Another official, Li Yiyan, also spoke against the idea, and Emperor Gaozong did not carry it out and still Empress Wu continued to rule the empire informally. because of this current of opposition Hao, From this point on, Empress Wu was said to be resentful of Hao, but as Hao always acted appropriately and was without fault, she could not find a way to accuse him of crimes. Later in 675, Emperor Gaozong made Hao Zhongshu Ling (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 677, he gave Hao an additional title as staff member for Li Xián, who had become crown prince after Li Hong's death in 675, as well as the honorific Jinzi Guanglu Daifu (金紫光祿大夫). In 679, Hao was made Shizhong (侍中), the head of the examination bureau and still chancellor. In spring 681, he was made advisor to Li Xiǎn (whose name had been changed by this point to Li Zhe), who was made crown prince in 680 following Li Xián's removal, but was by Empress Wu removed from his post as chancellor. He died later that year and was buried with great honor, but at the request that Hao himself had made prior to his death, submitted by his son Hao Beisou (郝北叟), not with great amount of material.  After death  After Emperor Gaozong's death around the new year 684, Li Zhe initially took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but in spring 684, after he showed signs of disobeying Empress Wu (who had become empress dowager and regent by that point), she deposed him and replaced him with his brother Li Dan (as Emperor Ruizong). Empress Dowager Wu held power firmly and encouraged reports of treason. In 688, a servant of Hao Chujun's grandson Hao Xiangxian (郝象賢) falsely accused Hao Xiangxian of plotting treason. Empress Dowager Wu put one of her favorite secret police officers Zhou Xing (周興) in charge of the investigation. Zhou found Hao Xiangxian guilty and sentenced him and his clan to death. On the way to the execution field, Hao Xiangxian cursed Empress Dowager Wu and accused her of all kinds of adulterous and otherwise inappropriate behavior, and at one point jumped out of the cart and took firewood to combat the soldiers escorting him. The soldiers killed him. Empress Dowager Wu ordered that Hao Xiangxian's body be cut into pieces, and that Hao Chujun's and Hao Xiangxian's father'sHao Chujun had at least two sons — Hao Beisou and Hao Nanrong (郝南容) — but might have had more, and it was not recorded which of Hao Chujun's sons was Hao Xiangxian's father. tombs be dug open, the caskets be destroyed, and the bones be burned. From this point on, until Empress Dowager Wu's death, every time that a prisoner was to be executed, the executioners would stuff his or her mouth with a wooden sphere.

The team was coached by Bob Davie and played its home games at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana. Season overview The 1999 season began on a positive note for Davie, who, after signing 21 recruits, was given a contract extension to coach until 2003. Though there were high hopes that the Irish could finally get another national championship, there were also many questions facing the team, top among those would be whether Jackson could lead a young Irish team. With some controversy surrounding a verbal agreement between Notre Dame and Michigan to not schedule a game before their September 4 matchup, the Irish instead opened the season in the Eddie Robinson Classic against Kansas. Though Jackson didn't answer all the questions in the game (throwing three interceptions), the Irish still dominated the Jayhawks in the 48–13 win. With the Irish ranked 16th they went next to face the seventh-ranked Wolverines. Watched by a, then NCAA record, crowd of 111,523, the Wolverines took the lead late in the game on an Anthony Thomas touchdown run. With under two minutes remaining, Jackson led the Irish down the field with three quick passes, however, the time ran out as he completed his fourth of the drive. Though the Irish lost, 26–22, they would remain at 16th in the national polls until stumbling against Purdue the next week. With Davie blaming poor communication on the loss, the Irish dropped from the rankings for the first time in two years. With a 10-game home winning streak, the Irish hoped to get back on track with a win against Michigan State. With the game tied 7–7 starting the fourth quarter, it looked to be headed for another last-minute decision, however, with five minutes left in the game, with the score tied again at 13–13, Spartans quarterback Bill Burke threw a quick pass to Gari Scott who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. Though the Irish had a chance and drove to the 50-yard line, Davie elected to punt the ball on fourth down with three minutes left in the game. The Spartans added a field goal to put them up 23–13 and win the game. After a week off, the Irish faced the 23rd-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. Down 30–14 mid-way through the third quarter, Jackson led the Irish on two scoring drives to bring them within two points. With the ball at their own 2-yard line, Jackson led a 98-yard drive that gave the Irish the winning touchdown. The Irish continued at home, blowing out Arizona State, coming from behind by 21 points to defeat USC, and scoring a last minute touchdown to beat Navy, to move back into the rankings. For the first time since September the Irish would go on the road. Facing the fourth-ranked Tennessee Volunteers, the Irish knew they were in for a tough test as Tennessee, the reigning winners of the inaugural BCS National Championship, had not lost a non-conference home game since the 1990 Irish team won there. Against the tough Volunteer defense, the Irish were only able to score 14 in the 24 point loss, and once again dropped from the rankings. With a loss to Pittsburgh in the final game at Pitt Stadium, and a last second loss on a failed two-point conversion against Boston College, the Irish lost all chances to go to a bowl game with a 5–6 record. Hoping to avoid their first losing season since 1986, they traveled to Stanford to face the Cardinal. With Jackson splitting time with Arnaz Battle, the Irish come from behind bid failed on a last second field goal by Stanford. Though the season was a disappointment, Jackson, a fifth-year senior, ended his career with the Irish on a high note. Named the team's Most Valuable Player, he set the single-season records in passing yards, total yards, pass attempts, and completions. He also left with the fourth-most passing yards in Irish history. Jackson was drafted in the seventh round of the 2000 NFL Draft, and, although he was the only player from the team drafted, nine others signed free agent contracts with NFL teams. The year ended on a bad note for the Irish program, as the NCAA placed the program on probation for two years after a number of major secondary violations by the university and others involved in athletics. Then-university president Rev. Edward Malloy disbanded all varsity booster clubs, the first time any university took such actions, and put into place other safeguards against violations, pledging his administration would give a greater effort to stop any future violations.

Season overview With wins in their final five regular season games of 1997, the Irish started Davie's second season with confidence. Despite losing record-setting quarterback Ron Powlus, the Irish returned 14 starters, including tailback Autry Denson and three senior linebackers that were placed on the preliminary list for the Dick Butkus Award. Powlus was replaced by Jarious Jackson who had played sparingly in 1997 but had amassed almost 200 passing yards in the time. In Jackson's first start, against Michigan, he threw two touchdowns to lead the Irish, ranked 22nd, over the 5th ranked Wolverines. Denson added 162 yards and two touchdowns to give the Irish a 36–20 win. The Irish moved to tenth in the rankings, however didn't stay long, as Michigan State, who led by 39 points at halftime, beat the Irish for the second year in a row. Dropping back to 23rd in the nation, the Irish returned home to face Purdue. The Boilermakers handed the Irish their first loss in 1997 which dropped the Irish from the rankings, and the Irish looked for retribution in this game. With the Irish down two with less than two minutes remaining, Tony Driver, who was switched to cornerback in the offseason, intercepted a Drew Brees pass to set up the go-ahead field goal for the Irish. With the Boilermakers once again moving the ball, Driver had his second interception with less than a minute remaining to preserve the win for the Irish. The Irish won all four of their October games, including a win over Stanford, a dominating win at Arizona State, a last minute win over Army, and a win over Baylor led by Denson's career high of 189 yards, to move back into the top-15 in the rankings. In the next game, the Boston College Eagles were poised for the upset of the Irish. Down 30–26, the Eagles had the ball on the Irish four-yard line with less than a minute remaining. The Irish defense, however, held the Eagles for four downs to preserve the win. The next week, led by Denson, who became the all-time leader in rushing yards at Notre Dame, the Irish shut-out Navy to increase their NCAA record winning streak over the Midshipmen to 35 games. Once again ranked tenth, the Irish faced LSU in their final home game. Avenging their loss in the , the Irish beat the Tigers on a late touchdown run. With a potential BCS berth on the line, and without Jackson, who was injured in the final play against LSU, the Irish traveled to face rivals USC in their final regular season game. Playing two backups at quarterback, including true freshman Arnaz Battle, the Irish were dominated by the tough Trojan defense that caused five turnovers. Though the Trojans, led by freshman quarterback Carson Palmer, couldn't produce much offense themselves, they only needed two scores to defeat the Irish 10–0. Missing out on a BCS bowl game, the Irish, who signed a deal early in the year that gave them a tie-in with the Big East Conference bowl games, accepted a bid to play Georgia Tech in the . Wearing their alternate green jerseys for the first time since the 1995 Fiesta Bowl, the Irish got behind early to the Yellow Jackets with two long touchdowns. Though closing the gap to a touchdown in the fourth quarter, the Irish couldn't move the ball on their last two drives and lost their fourth straight bowl game. They finished the season with a 9–3 record and dropped to 22nd in the national rankings. After the season, seven players were taken in the 1999 National Football League (NFL) Draft. Among them were Denson, who left with multiple Notre Dame rushing records, Malcolm Johnson, who left with a Notre Dame record of six consecutive games with a touchdown catch, and most of the offensive line starters.

Led by fifth–year senior quarterback Ron Powlus, a running back crew of Autry Denson, Tony Driver, and Joey Goodspeed, a wide receiving corps of Joey Getherall, Bobby Brown, and Malcolm Johnson, and on defense by cornerback Allen Rossum, the Irish looked to have a good enough team to challenge to be in the top-10. The Irish began the Davie era at home, playing Georgia Tech in the newly renovated Notre Dame Stadium. The Irish christened the stadium with a close win over the Yellow Jackets that was sparked by a renewed running game and key defensive stops late in the game. With the close win, the Irish showed their weakness and dropped a spot in the national ranking. The next week, at Purdue, though the Irish had 457 total yards, they only managed 17 points. With key mistakes on offense and a confused defense, the Irish lost 28–17 and dropped out of the rankings. With losses against Michigan State, at Michigan, and at Stanford, the Irish were suddenly 1–4 and struggling to find an offense. Offensive coordinator, Jim Colletto, took most of the flak for the struggles. The Irish looked to be getting back on track with a trip to face Pittsburgh. With a renewed running game, the Irish beat the struggling Panthers by 24, however, with the offense struggling once again in their next game, a loss to rival University of Southern California (USC), the Irish hit, what was called, \\"rock bottom.\\" With a slight quarterback controversy, the Irish next faced Boston College. Though backup quarterback Jarious Jackson played 21 downs, Powlus led the Irish with 267 passing yards to rout the Eagles and put the Irish offense back on track. With a last minute win over Navy the next week, the Irish moved to 4–5 and would need to win their final three games to become bowl eligible. The Irish next went to Louisiana State University (LSU) to face the 11th ranked Tigers. Looked to be outmatched, the Irish didn't commit a penalty all game, had no turnovers, and didn't give up any plays longer than one 28 yard pass, to upset the Tigers and move back to 5–5 on the season. The Irish then faced 22nd ranked West Virginia for their final home game. With the game tied late in the fourth quarter, Powlus led the Irish on a drive that was capped by his final touchdown pass at Notre Dame Stadium for the game-winning touchdown. With the win the Irish beat ranked opponents on consecutive Saturdays for the first time since 1992, and with the last minute win at Hawaii the next week, the Irish moved to 7–5 and were bowl eligible. Once again facing LSU in Louisiana (in the Independence Bowl), this time with the Tigers ranked 15th, LSU dominated on offense and beat the Irish 27–9. Though the Irish finished with a loss, the 7–6 record was the biggest Irish turn around in team history. By the end of the season, Powlus set a single season Irish record for pass attempts and completions. He would leave Notre Dame with 20 individual records, including career passing yards, attempts, completions and touchdowns, all marks that would finally be eclipsed almost ten years later by future Irish quarterback Brady Quinn. Cornerback Allen Rossum, who also served as the Irish kick returner, set an NCAA single season record with nine returns (three each of interceptions, punts, and kickoffs) for touchdowns. He would also leave Notre Dame with the Irish all-time leading kick return average (23.5 yards per return). Autry Denson's 1268 rushing yards were fourth in the Irish single season record and moved him to third on the Irish all-time list in career rushing yards.

Some popular land animals consumed include bats, mice, rats and lizards. Most of the dishes on the islands are cooked in coconut oil. Like in many others archipelagos, the islands' surrounding waters make seafood another popular option. Some seafoods include sea cucumbers, whale's meat, and various fish. It is said that the Mariana Island's cuisine is heavily influenced by its neighbors Papuan, Hawaiian, and American cuisines. The Mariana's cuisine is very international, with many dishes, such as Korean kimchi, Filipino pancit and Spanish empanadas being enjoyed on the islands.

The building's construction was financed by three Rockford citizens and it operated as a hotel from its opening until 1951. The hotel was purchased by Thomas Chick in 1888 and he renamed it from the Griggs House to the Chick House. In 2004 the city of Rockford purchased two-thirds of the building and made some modifications to the structure. The building is a mesh between the Greek Revival and Italianate styles and feature simple ornamentation that contrasts with a neighboring building. The Chick House is a Rockford Landmark and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The Chick House is located in present-day downtown Rockford, Illinois, directly across the street from the Rockford MetroCentre. The Chick House was constructed in 1857 under the name Griggs House on the northwest corner of Main and Elm Streets in downtown Rockford. Its construction was financed by three Rockford residents, Dr. R.P. Lane, and two bankers, Thomas D. Robertson, and Charles H. Spafford. From its construction, the building operated as the Griggs House hotel. Thomas Chick purchased the building in 1888 and rechristened the hotel as the Chick House. Through the early 1900s parts of the building was occupied by various tenants as Chick leased out space, and Chick rented out space in adjacent buildings to supply additional lodging space for the Chick House hotel. Rates at the Chick House, in 1902, started at US$1.50 per day, compared to the Nelson House at $2.00 per day; the Nelson House opened in Rockford in 1892.Illinois Farmers Institute.

During its closure, an office supply store, hardware store, and shoe store occupied the east end of the structure.

The work included the installation of Plexiglas windows to keep further moisture out, the installation of a green awning on the east facade which wraps around to the south slightly, and repairs to the parapet wall. Architecture The Chick House's simple east facade contrasts with the adjacent Richardson Romanesque building. The Chick House's design is simple and utilitarian, reflecting its construction for use as a hotel. The three-story brick structure's 66 foot (20.1 m) east facade faces Main Street and its 149-foot (45.4 m) south facade faces toward Elm Street. The building incorporates elements from Greek Revival and Italianate styles and presents itself as an architectural \\"antithesis\\" to the adjacent Richardson Romanesque Stewart Building. The Chick House originally has an \\"L\\" shape but additions during the 1890s, 1900s and in 1932 partially filled in the rear of the building, which faces toward an alley. The utilitarian design of the Chick House is accented by simple decorative touches in the Greek Revival style. The style is most overt in the building's symmetry which is particularly emphasized by certain elements. Those include the steeped parapet, its windows, horizontal stone sills and lintels, and dentil moldings. The building's meshing of Greek Revival and Italianate styles illustrates the rising popularity of the Italianate style during the 1850s and the shift from Greek Revival to Italianate.The pattern books of Andrew Jackson Downing helped increase the popularity of the Italianate style throughout the 1840s and 1850s. The style grew out of the Picturesque movement, along with Gothic Revival in England. See Olafson, \\"Chick House.\\" The narrow front facade windows and the brick corbel table frieze at the cornice are two elements of Italianate incorporated into the building. The Romanesque and Italianate detailing is emphasized within the front facade fenestration as well. The windows contain segmental arches and cast iron hood molds. Significance The Chick House is one of three remaining pre-Civil War commercial buildings in downtown Rockford. It is also the only fully intact example of mid-19th century architecture in the city of Rockford. The only other two pre-Civil War commercial buildings in Rockford are located on the east side of the Rock River and have had extensive alterations to their front facades. The Chick House is the only building in the trio that has maintained its historic integrity, and the only 19th century Rockford hotel building still standing. The buildings architecture and its importance to the commerce of the city of Rockford led the U.S. National Register of Historic Places to approve its nomination on February 7, 1997.

The campaign ended with a No Car Day Saturday.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-09/17/content_6110438.htm This Chinese national urban transport campaign was implemented by the Ministry of Construction. During the week of September 22, walking, biking, public transportation, and carpooling are encouraged. On No Car Day they will have special 'green zones' in hundreds of cities. These normally vehicle congested areas will be open only to pedestrians, bicycles, and buses from 7am to 7pm. No Car Day’s main objective is to promote public transportation. Public transportation helps to conserve energy and have lower emission because the number of vehicles has been reduced. No Car Day was originally started in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games that were being held in Beijing. It is estimated that the 2007 campaign saved 33 million liters of gasoline and cut emissions by 3,000 tons. Issues Although over 100 cities were participating in No Car Day, it wasn't making an impact everywhere. Beijing, the capital of China, had cars on the road as if it was a normal day. There were even some roads that weren't going along with no car day.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7007893.stm During the span of no car day citizens Side by side pictures of Beijing, China. One with smog and the other without. were encouraged to walk, take public transit or ride a bike. Driving automobiles in China has become a status symbol for many residents. Bikers were being judged and being victims of prejudiced just because they chose to ride a bike instead of a car. The people of China were not interested in undoing all that they've accomplished in it being more acceptable to drive cars. Before the 1980s, having a car for personal use was illegal and bikes packed city streets.http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/world/china-s- no-car-day-has-little-impact-on-driving-habits-1.650358 The picture on the right shows what Beijing, China would look like if No Car Day made more of an impact on individuals. But it also shows the daily occurrence of smog filled air that accompanies China. Smog makes it hard to breathe and is unhealthy for the population. Events No Car Day's original focus was to advocate drivers about the environmental impact of driving cars.https://thenanfang.com/beijing- unable-get-cars-brake-world-car-free-day/ But it always hasn't grabbed drivers attentions in China. No Car Day hasn't necessarily been a recurring thing. They've advocated for the environment but they haven't made strides in getting people to do more public transportation. In 2014 they tried to bring it back and even though it was in effect, roads were still congested.http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-09/23/content_18646763.htm They advocated for drivers to stay clear on the car free zones but they were suggestion and not enforced. In the future China could start charging a tax for driving in traffic congestion. This would make it more expensive to drive and could effect how many Chinese people drive. What China did in 2015 was they asked Chinese people to drive less for World Car Free Day. http://www.cctv-america.com/2015/09/22/china-asks-people-to-drive-less-for- world-car-free-day In China more than 170 cities took part in World Car Free Day. This is similar to No Car Day but is a more worldwide event. Also in 2015, leading up the Military Parade, they had martial laws on particular roads that you were forbidden to drive on.

Imidazenil is a highly potent benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects, yet without any notable sedative or amnestic effects. In fact, imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of diazepam, yet without lowering the convulsion threshold, and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist flumazenil which is commonly used to treat benzodiazepine overdose at present. Imidazenil has not yet been developed commercially for use in humans, however it has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for anxiety, a potent yet non-sedating anticonvulsant which might be particularly useful in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphate nerve agents, and as a novel treatment for schizophrenia.

It is a tool for addressing overspill parking from neighboring population centers (such as a shopping center, office building, apartment building, transit station, stadium, or central business district). Typically, residents in the zone pay a small fee to the government in exchange for a placard or sticker placed on their automobile(s) that indicates the zone designation (signified by a number or letter). In the United States, residential zoned parking was challenged in 1977 as violating the constitutional right of equal protection of the laws, because it favored one group of people (nearby residents) over another group of people (commuters). However, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the practice did not violate Equal Protection. Since then, it has been put into common practice throughout the United States, and has even been used in non- residential areas when a local street's parking is reserved for a business, museum or other facility.

After graduating from college in 1994, Moyer began to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian. Speaking of the experience, Moyer said in an interview: Years later, after experiencing his first divorce, Moyer wrote a screenplay based on his own life experiences of being a divorced Mormon trying to make it as a stand-up comedian. He named the script The Singles Ward. Eventually, Moyer showed the script to Kurt Hale, grandson of Ruth Hale (founder of the Hale Center Theater, a popular Utah Valley community theater). Hale and partner Dave Hunter decided to make the script into low- budget comedy aimed at members of the LDS Church. Hale re-wrote the script and directed the movie. Eventually, Hale and Hunter founded a company called Halestorm Entertainment to distribute the movie in 2002. Although panned by critics, The Singles Ward was a popular novelty for Mormon audiences, grossing $1,250,798The Singles Ward at Box Office Mojo at theaters in Utah and other areas with heavy Mormon populations. Upon the financial success of The Singles Ward, Hale quickly got to work on his second LDS comedy movie, The R.M. Once again, Hale directed from a script co-written by Hale and Moyer, and Hale cast many of the same actors from his first movie. The R.M. was released by Halestorm Entertainment in 2003. Although the box office returns were almost as strong as The Singles Ward ($1,111,615),The R.M. at Box Office Mojo audience feedback was not as favorable. In 2003, Halestorm Entertainment released The Home Teachers, the third LDS comedy by Kurt Hale. Like before, the movie was from a script co-written by Hale and Moyer. The Home Teachers was a critical and box office disappointment. Critics lambasted its use of slapstick humor and criticized what they perceived as a heavy-handed plot. The film also suffered from direct comparisons to Tommy Boy, a popular 1995 film starring Chris Farley, and David Spade, and Planes, Trains & Automobiles, a 1987 film directed by John Hughes. Many critics felt that The Home Teachers borrowed too much from these films, a concern one professional critic referred to as \\"verging on comedic plagiarism\\".The Home Teachers: Deseret News Review The movie grossed $203,917The Home Teachers at Box Office Mojo during its theatrical run, less than 17% the gross of The Singles Ward. After The Home Teachers, Moyer departed from Hale and to make his own LDS movie, Mobsters and Mormons. Halestorm Entertainment released Mobsters and Mormons in 2005. The movie grossed $409,604Mobsters and Mormons at Box Office Mojo in total box office revenues, approximately 33% the gross of The Singles Ward. Moyer has not directed another feature film. In 2007, Halestorm Entertainment released The Singles 2nd Ward, a straight-to-DVD sequel to the 2002 movie, co-written by Hale and Moyer. In 2011, Moyer produced The Real Life Singles Ward, a straight-to-DVD video documentary about LDS dating, produced on a budget of $3,100. In 2012, Moyer wrote and acted in Disjointed Custody, a four-minute movie directed by Christian Serge that was posted on YouTube. Moyer wrote the short script based on observations made during his own divorces. In 2012, John Moyer became a comedy hypnotist.

Composed in 1865, the work commemorates the death of Brahms's mother, Christiane, earlier that year. However, it draws on a theme which Brahms had composed twelve years previously but did not publish at the time. The work was first performed in Zurich on November 28, 1865, and was published a year later in November 1866. The Horn Trio was the last chamber piece Brahms wrote for the next eight years. Brahms chose to write the work for natural horn rather than valve horn despite the fact that the valve horn was becoming more common. The timbre of the natural horn is more somber and melancholic than the valve horn and creates a much different mood. Brahms himself, however, believed that the open tones of the natural horn had a fuller quality than those produced by valves. Nineteenth-century listeners associated the sound of the natural horn with nature and the calls of the hunt. Fittingly, Brahms once said that the opening theme of the first movement came to him while he was walking through the woods. Brahms also learned natural horn (as well as piano and cello) as a child, which may be another reason why he chose to write for these instruments following the death of his mother. Notwithstanding Brahms's love for the sound of the natural horn, he did specify that the horn part could be played by a celloCorrections to title page in Brahms' hand on original manuscript and it was indeed published with a transposed cello part. Much later in 1884 Brahms also reworked the part for viola. Movements The work is divided into four movements: In the first movement, Brahms emphasizes the simplicity of the opening theme by abandoning the structure of sonata form in favour of three slow sections offset by two shorter, more rhapsodic segments. Brahms also deviates from classical practice by adopting a slow–fast–slow–fast order of movements, perhaps looking back to the old sonata da chiesa form. The Scherzo represents a lighter side of grief; since the work as a whole simulates the stages of mourning, the Scherzo serves as the reminder of happy memories. As in the first movement, Brahms uses the pitches of the E overtone series to establish the theme. (This theme is found in some variation in every movement, most directly in the Finale.) The playfulness that the tempo suggests offers a break from the slow and somber surrounding movements. The contrasting trio section uses transposed material from a small unpublished piano piece (Albumblatt) which Brahms had written twelve years earlier, in 1853. The Adagio mesto opens with four measures of solo piano in the low register of the instrument; this sets up the solemn, contemplative mood of the movement that is emphasized by the entrance of the violin and horn. Daniel Gregory Mason held the Adagio from the Horn Trio to be one of Brahms's most impassioned and heartfelt slow movements. The Finale contains the main theme that is present in the previous three movements, but it is prominently displayed in E major in a lively tempo. The joy felt in the Finale symbolizes the recovery at the end of mourning.  Orchestration  In 2006 hornist Radek Baborák took part in the premiere of Miloš Bok's arrangement of the work as a concerto for horn (or viola, or cello), violin and orchestra.

It consists of continental sandstone with thin beds of marine limestones, and marls. The Nubian Sandstone was deposited between the Lower Paleozoic and Upper Cretaceous, with marine beds dating from the Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous.Issawi 1973, p.1433 Formation The Nubian Sandstone ranges in age from the Cambrian to Upper Cretaceous eras. Positioning of the paleoequator and paleolatitude at 20° S was derived from paleomagnetic data showing the Nubian was originally deposited in the paleoequatorial to subequatorial zone. These paleomagnetic results corroborated previous studies suggesting that north Africa did not shift in latitude from 210 to 110 million years ago and extended this period to 85 million years. Nubian Sandstone was deposited under a tropical to subtropical climate and formed under a variety of continental conditions, including eolian merging intermittently into shallow marine.El-Shazly 1982 Characteristics Nubian Sandstone formation of Amram Columns, Eilat Massif, Israel The Nubian Sandstone complex has a thickness varying from under 500 m to over 3000 m, resting on the Precambrian basement. This is complicated by various structural faults and fold axes traversing the region in a north-eastern direction. Maximum development occurs in the Ain Dalla basin, a downthrown structural block south-west of the Bahariya oasis. Basement features present a dominant control on the complex's structural and sedimentological form. Despite many structural complications, the Nubian Sandstone likely constitutes a single hydrogeological system west of the Suez Gulf. To the east, on the Sinai Peninsula, a second system might exist with some connection to the primary western system in the north. The main western system, extending into Libya and Sudan, consists of a multi- layered artesian basin where massive groundwater reserves accumulated, principally during pluvials of the Quaternary. Locally, carbonate rocks overlying complex karst features and are recharged from the underlying major aquifer.A. Shata Fluvial and structural interpretations from 2007 show the desert in western Egypt was induced by fluvial action, including recently mapped alluvial fans. In central areas, braided channels are spatially aligned to a north-east structural trend, suggesting preferential water flow paths. Alluvial fans and structurally enclosed channels with gentle slopes and optimal recharge conditions between 1 and 5%, indicating high groundwater potential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interpretations correlated with anomalies from groundwater in 383 wells, suggest a connection between the spatial organization of fluvial and structural features with low-salinity groundwater, which exists adjacent to alluvial fans and the south-west reaches of structurally enclosed channels. Wells in the vicinity of structures contained low-salinity water.El-Baz & El-Shazly, 2007 Derived soils Nubian Sandstone exposures in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid conditions produce soil that is red and sandy but very different in other aspects. Only in sub-humid zones do these soils contain a moderately developed profile, including a textural B horizon lacking soluble salts and carbonates. In semi-arid and arid zones, profile differentiation is either weak or does not exist. In arid zones soils are shallow and contain carbonates, and soluble salts, including gypsum. The sole clay mineral common to all Nubian sandstone parent materials is kaolinite, which is the major clay mineral in sub-humid zone soil. In semi- arid soils smectite is a second major clay component. In arid zones small amounts of smectite and palygorskite accompany kaolinite. It is likely that smectite and palygorskite are products of pedogenic neoformation. Aeolian material was probably introduced into the silt and fine sand fractions from semi-arid and arid soils. It is also possible that some contamination of clay fractions occurred.A. Singer 1974, p. 310 Nubian Sandstone in Arabia When in contact with Upper Cretaceous limestone, Nubian Sandstone underlies the latter conformably. In Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon and Hermon it is underlain by Jurassic limestone. Its upper strata is likely from the Lower or Middle Cretaceous age. However, Jurassic limestone is absent in southern areas. In Western Sinai, Nubian Sandstone rests on Carboniferous limestone, and by the Dead Sea on Cambrian limestone: at Petra and other locations it rests unconformably on crystalline rocks. While age calculation for the Nubian Sandstone is relatively simple in Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon and Hermon, it is much more complicated in Western Sinai and the Dead Sea area. Since sandstone is assumed to form more rapidly than other rocks it is difficult to conceive that the 2,000 feet of sandstone in the southeastern Dead Sea was in the formative process from the Cambrian to the Cretaceous. Appearance Liesegang rings made of iron oxide in sandstone from a chamber in Petra, Jordan Nubian Sandstone is most commonly brown or reddish, but in places it shows a much wider variety of color. The ancient temples and tombs in Petra were carved from this rock. In certain places it is extremely friable, and in others compact and hard. Sand in the Arabian deserts was primarily derived from it, carried by prevailing western winds. Where it is covered by a sheet of eruptive rock (charrah), it is protected from erosion. Nubian Sandstone frequently includes strata of clay and shale and thin seams of coal or lignite. This indicates that it was deposited in seas that were relatively shallow at the time. Etymology The term Nubian Sandstone was first introduced to the Egyptian stratigraphy by Joseph Rüssegger in 1837, who used the term \\"Sandstein von Nubien\\" to designate nonfossiliferous sandstone sections of Paleozoic or Mesozoic age. Rüssegger followed and studied this series of sandstone formations from the Sudan, Egypt, Libya, and Arabia Petrsea (northeastern Arabia).R.

Description This small fish reaches up to in standard length. The males have a copper color, the females are more pale and silvery. Both have white tips on the fins, hence the name. They differ from most other tetras by lacking a small second dorsal (adipose) fin. Silvertip tetras have a black area at the base of their caudal fin. The fish are transparent except for the fact that their bodies have an overall copper sheen. During the night, the copper and black become silver as the fish rests — the color is reactivated once the fish becomes active in the morning. Other than coloration, sexual dimorphism is slight, the female having a very slightly larger belly. These tropical, freshwater fish thrive in temperatures that range from 71°F - 82°F (22°C - 28°C). The silvertip tetra lives in slightly acidic waters that range from a pH of 6.0 - 8.0. These fish like to be kept in schools of 5 or more fish.

The valleys lie in the rain shadow of the surrounding mountain ranges, and are drier than the surrounding ecoregions. Adjacent ecoregions The Tehuacán Valley matorral is bounded by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests to the northwest, north, and northeast, the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine-oak forests to the east, and by the Balsas dry forests to the southeast, south, and southwest. Flora Xeric vegetation in Tehuacán Valley. The Tehuacán Valley matorral is a center of plant diversity, with over 2700 species, of which approximately 30% are endemic. It is a center of diversity for species of Agave, Hechtia, Salvia, and cactus. The ecoregion has a number of distinct plant communities. Fauna The ecoregion is notable for its diversity of birds and bats. Of the 90 species of birds present, 10 are endemic, including the ocellated thrasher (Toxostoma ocellatum), and bridled sparrow (Aimorphilla mystacalis). 34 species of bats inhabit the ecoregion, of which 18 are endangered, vulnerable, or rare.

It is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. It was described by John Gould in 1877, with the type locality recorded as the Lawas River in northern Sarawak. Taxonomy The pitta was formerly considered a subspecies of the garnet pitta but was split because of morphological and vocal differences as well as apparent parapatry. Lack of evidence of hybridisation suggests that the garnet and black-headed pittas are allospecies. Description Sepilok Nature Resort - Sabah, Borneo - Malaysia - flash photo The birds grow to a length of and a weight of . An adult pitta is distinctively marked with a black head and breast contrasting with a crimson belly and prominent, pale blue, narrow raised stripes extending back from the eyes. The upperparts are dark purple-blue with an iridescent azure patch on the bend of the wing. The tip of the bill is bright red to orange. Nestlings are yellow with coral-red gapes and bill tips. Juveniles are uniformly dark brown until they begin to acquire adult plumage. Behaviour=Breeding The breeding season extends from early February to late July, the driest time of the year. The nest has been described as domed, built on a muddy bank on a pile of coarse sticks and bark, with a cup made of fine roots and leaves, and a roof of leaves. A clutch of two is laid; the eggs are white with blotches and spots of dark red and black. Feeding The pitta consumes a variety of largely invertebrate prey. Its diet includes spiders, ants, cockroaches, beetles and snails. Voice Danum Valley, Malaysia The call of the black-crowned pitta is similar to that of the garnet pitta in being characterised by a quiet whistle, lasting about four seconds, rising in both power and pitch. It differs in stopping less abruptly and in wavering slightly in mid-call. Distribution and habitat Roosting on a perch at night, in Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia The pitta has only been recorded from the Malaysian state of Sabah in northern Borneo, where it occupies lowland tropical rainforests from sea level up to about 300 m, above which it is replaced by the blue-banded pitta. It prefers dark and damp places, especially ravines beneath dense cover. In prime habitat, such as the primary forest of the Danum Valley Conservation Area, recorded population densities are 21–22 pairs per square kilometre. It can also be found in areas that have been selectively logged as well as in overgrown rubber and Albizia plantations. Status and conservation The pitta is likely to have been affected by the rapid and sustained deforestation which has taken place in northern Borneo. Despite the ability of the species to persist in some degraded habitats, it is thought to have suffered a moderately rapid population decline, and is therefore classified as near threatened.

Early life Ernst Christian Einar Ludvig Detlev, Graf (Count) zu Reventlow was born at Husum, Schleswig-Holstein, the son of Ludvig Christian Detlev Frederik, Graf zu Reventlow (January 6, 1824 - June 14, 1893), a Danish nobleman, and Emilie Julie Anna Louise Rantzau (April 19, 1834 - November 19, 1905). His younger sister was Fanny zu Reventlow (1871-1918), the \\"Bohemian Countess\\" of Schwabing. Reventlow embarked upon a career in the German Imperial Navy, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander, before his marriage to a Frenchwoman, Marie-Gabrielle-Blanche d'Allemont [de Broutillot] (September 19, 1873 - April 15, 1937), forced him to resign his commission. Ernst and Blanche were married on March 14, 1895 in Altona, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Ernst became a free-lance writer on naval issues, and later general politics. World War I During World War I, as an editorial writer on the Deutsche Tageszeitung, he advocated extreme ruthlessness, particularly in submarine warfare. He accused United States Ambassador Gerard of being a British spy, but assailed Zimmermann for the plot to form an alliance between Mexico and Japan against the United States. He furiously attacked Germany's leaders for yielding to the United States' demands for respect of its rights after the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Tageszeitung was suspended 25 June 1915. For an attack on Bethmann-Hollweg, accusing him of misleading von Hindenburg, he was sued for slander in 1916. He was highly critical of the policies of Kaiser Wilhelm II and later of the Weimar Republic. In 1920 he founded his own newspaper, Der Reichswart (“Reich Guardian”), which was published until his death. National Bolshevik period In the immediate post-World War I period, a National Bolshevik idea came from Comintern agent Karl Radek postulating that a community of interests existed between German nationalists and the isolated Bolshevik regime in Russia. At first Reventlow denounced the “delusion of the so-called National Bolsheviks that Communism could turn towards nationalism,”Ernst graff zu Reventlow, “Nationalbolschewismus,” Der Reichswart, I, #6 (1920), p. 8, cited by Klemens von Klemperer, “Germany's new conservatism; its history and dilemma in the twentieth century, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1957, p. 144. but when Radek seized the occasion of the Ruhr occupation to deliver his Schlageter Oration before the Enlarged Executive Committee of the Comintern in 1923, Reventlow responded with sympathetic articles in Der Reichswart that were subsequently re-printed in the communist central organ Rote Fahne. This collaboration was short-lived, though it marks Reventlow clearly as a leftist. Later he was to write approvingly of the KPD’s domestic policies in the Deutsches Tageblatt and to demand fifty-percent managerial control of any enterprise by the workers.Dietrich Orlow, “History of the Nazi Party: 1919 - 1933,” University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, PA, 1969, p. 96. It is reported that Reventlow alone among the Nazi leaders was never booed when addressing crowds of workers.Albert Krebs, “The infancy of Nazism: the memoirs of ex-Gauleiter Albert Krebs, 1923-1933,” New Viewpoints, New York, 1976. DVFP and NSDAP involvement In 1924 Reventlow and Albrecht von Graefe broke from the German National People's Party (DNVP) to form the German Völkisch Freedom Party (DVFP) which was both more Völkish and left-wing than the conservative DNVP. Both men were elected to the Reichstag as DNVP deputies, though in May 1927 Reventlow quarreled with the more conservative Graefe and left the party to join the NSDAP (Nazi Party), bringing over his faction en bloc, including Bernhard Rust, Franz Stöhr, and Wilhelm Kube, each of whom were to enjoy prominent roles in the Nazi Party. This greatly improved the NSDAP position in northern Germany, where the DVFP had always been stronger than the NSDAP, and by the end of 1928 the DVFP had for all intents and purposes ceased to exist. Reventlow’s group quickly allied themselves with the more socialistic wing of the NSDAP headed by Gregor Strasser which favored genuine socialistic measures and an alliance with the Soviets against the western democracies. Though a power in the party to the end, this group became less influential as Hitler turned to overt militarism and antisemitism after attaining power. Reventlow was never liked or trusted by Hitler, but his personal popularity was substantial and Hitler chose not to cross him but to ignore him. Reventlow was never given a high party office nor, after the seizure of power, was he given any government post. Though often critical of government policies, he was allowed to publish his newspaper, Der Reichswart, until his death in 1943. Antisemitism Reventlow supported a theory first proposed by Lesley Fry (pen-name of Paquita de Shishmareff ) (1882-1970), who in her book Waters Flowing Eastward (Paris: Éditions R.I.S.S., 1931)R.I.S.S. = Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes, whose primary editor was Mgr. Ernest Jouin (December 21, 1844 - June 27, 1932). claimed that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were the master plan of a conspiracy according to which a group led by \\"cultural Zionist\\" Asher Ginzberg plotted world domination. However, at the time, Ginzberg supported an international Jewish cultural and political revival, rather than a single Jewish state. Reventlow named Fry as his source for his own thinking on the origins of the Protocols. After Philip Graves provided evidence in The Times that the Protocols were plagiarised forgery, Reventlow published his support for Fry's theory of Ginzberg's authorship in the periodical La Vieille France. Ginzberg's supporters sued Reventlow, who was forced to retract and pay damages.Susan Sarah Cohen, Antisemitism: an annotated bibliography, Volume 8, Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, p.444. However he continued to propagate his views. Religious activism Reventlow’s antisemitism was never racial, as was Hitler’s, but cultural, and this led to his involvement with the German Faith Movement. From 1934 to 1936, Reventlow served as deputy chairman of this religious movement which postulated that every people “through its blood” developed its own religious knowledge. The movement was anti-Christian and tried to create a “species-true faith” for Germany.Count Ernst Zu Reventlow, “Where is God?,”“Friends of Europe” publications ; no. 47, London, 1937 Works (in English translation) * \\"The vampire of the continent\\", 1916 (translated by George Chatterton-Hill from the German original titled \\"Der Vampir des Festlandes; eine Darstellung der englischen Politik nach ihren Triebkräften, mitteln und wirkungen\\", 1915) * “Where is God?” “Friends of Europe” publications ; no. 47, London, 1937 * “The Neutrals In This War,” Current History, a journal published by The New York Times, October 1915, p. 169-172.

A quadrant is an instrument that is used to measure angles up to 90°. Different versions of this instrument could be used to calculate various readings, such as longitude, latitude, and time of day. It was originally proposed by Ptolemy as a better kind of astrolabe. Several different variations of the instrument were later produced by medieval Muslim astronomers. Mural quadrants were important astronomical instruments in the 18th century European observatories, establishing a use for positional astronomy. Etymology The term quadrant, meaning one fourth, refers to the fact that early versions of the instrument were derived from astrolabes. The quadrant condensed the workings of the astrolabe into an area one fourth the size of the astrolabe face; it was essentially a quarter of an astrolabe. History Ptolemy using a quadrant A quadrant in a Turkish illustration One of the earliest accounts of a quadrant comes from Ptolemy's Almagest around 150\\\\. He described a \\"plinth\\" that could measure the altitude of the noon sun by projecting the shadow of a peg on a graduated arc of 90 degrees. This quadrant was unlike later versions of the instrument; it was larger and consisted of several moving parts. Ptolemy's version was a derivative of the astrolabe and the purpose of this rudimentary device was to measure the meridian angle of the sun. Islamic astronomers in the Middle Ages improved upon these ideas and constructed quadrants throughout the Middle East, in observatories such as Marageh, Rey and Samarkand. At first these quadrants were usually very large and stationary, and could be rotated to any bearing to give both the altitude and azimuth for any celestial body. As Islamic astronomers made advancements in astronomical theory and observational accuracy they are credited with developing four different types of quadrants during the Middle Ages and beyond. The first of these, the sine quadrant, was invented by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. The other types were the universal quadrant, the horary quadrant and the astrolabe quadrant. During the Middle Ages the knowledge of these instruments spread to Europe. In the 13th century Jewish astronomer Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon was crucial in further developing the quadrant. He was a skilled astronomer and wrote several volumes on the topic, including an influential book detailing how to build and use an improved version of the quadrant. The quadrant that he invented came to be known as the novus quadrans, or new quadrant. This device was revolutionary because it was the first quadrant to be built that did not involve several moving parts and thus could be much smaller and more portable. Tibbon's Hebrew manuscripts were translated into Latin and improved upon by French scholar Peter Nightingale several years later. Because of the translation, Tibbon, or Prophatius Judaeus as he was known in Latin, became an influential name in astronomy. His new quadrant was based upon the idea that the stereographic projection that defines a planispheric astrolabe can still work if the astrolabe parts are folded into a single quadrant. The result was a device that was far cheaper, easier to use and more portable than a standard astrolabe. Tibbon's work had a far reach and influenced Copernicus, Christopher Clavius and Erasmus Reinhold; and his manuscript was referenced in Dante's Divine Comedy. As the quadrant became smaller and thus more portable, its value for navigation was soon realized. The first documented use of the quadrant to navigate at sea is in 1461, by Diogo Gomes. Sailors began by measuring the height of Polaris to ascertain their latitude. This application of quadrants is generally attributed to Arab sailors who traded along the east coast of Africa and often travelled out of sight of land. It soon became more common to take the height of the sun at a given time due to the fact that Polaris disappears south of the equator. In 1618 English Mathematician Edmund Gunter further adapted the quadrant with an invention that came to be known as the Gunter quadrant. This pocket sized quadrant was revolutionary because it was inscribed with projections of the tropics, the equator, the horizon and the ecliptic. With the correct tables one could use the quadrant to find the time, the date, the length of the day or night, the time of sunrise and sunset and the meridian. The Gunter quadrant was extremely useful but it had its drawbacks; the scales only applied to a certain latitude so the instrument's use was limited at sea. Types Engraving of Tycho Brahe's Mural quadrant in Uraniborg in 1598, picturing the two clocks. There are several types of quadrants: *Mural quadrants, used for determining the time by measuring the altitudes of astronomical objects. Tycho Brahe created one of the largest mural quadrants. In order to tell time he would place two clocks next to the quadrant so that he could identify the minutes and seconds in relation to the measurements on the side of the instrument. *Large frame-based instruments used for measuring angular distances between astronomical objects. *Geometric quadrant used by surveyors and navigators. *Davis quadrant a compact, framed instrument used by navigators for measuring the altitude of an astronomical object. They can also be classified as: Horary quadrant for a latitude of about 51.5° as depicted in an instructional text of 1744: To find the Hour of the Day: Lay the thread just upon the Day of the Month, then hold it till you slip the small Bead or Pin-head [along the thread] to rest on one of the 12 o'Clock Lines; then let the Sun shine from the Sight G to the other at D, the Plummet hanging at liberty, the Bead will rest on the Hour of the Day. *Altitude – The plain quadrant with plumb line, used to take the altitude of an object. *Gunner's – A type of clinometer used by an artillerist to measure the elevation or depression angle of a gun barrel of a cannon or mortar, both to verify proper firing elevation, and to verify the correct alignment of the weapon-mounted fire control devices. *Gunter's – A quadrant used for time determination as well as the length of day, when the sun had risen and set, the date, and the meridian using scales and curves of the quadrant along with related tables. It was invented by Edmund Gunter in 1623. Gunter's quadrant was fairly simple which allowed for its widespread and long-lasting use in the 17th and 18th centuries. Gunter expanded the basic features of other quadrants to create a convenient and comprehensive instrument. Its distinguishable feature included projections of the tropics, equator, ecliptic, and the horizon. *Islamic – King identified four types of quadrants that were produced by Muslim astronomers. #The sine quadrant (Arabic: Rubul Mujayyab) – also known as the Sinecal Quadrant – was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations. It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in 9th century Baghdad and prevalent until the nineteenth century. Its defining feature is a graph-paper like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead, for calculation, and a plumb bob. They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes. #The universal (shakkāzīya) quadrant – used for solving astronomical problems for any latitude: These quadrants had either one or two sets of shakkāzīya grids and were developed in the fourteenth century in Syria. Some astrolabes are also printed on the back with the universal quadrant like an astrolabe created by Ibn al-Sarrāj. #The horary quadrant – used for finding the time with the sun: The horary quadrant could be used to find the time either in equal or unequal (length of the day divided by twelve) hours. Different sets of markings were created for either equal or unequal hours. For measuring the time in equal hours, the horary quadrant could only be used for one specific latitude while a quadrant for unequal hours could be used anywhere based on an approximate formula. One edge of the quadrant had to be aligned with the sun, and once aligned, a bead on the plumbline attached to the centre of the quadrant showed the time of the day. An example exists dated 1396, from European sources (Richard II of England). The oldest horary quadrant was found during an excavation in 2013 in the Hanseatic town of Zutphen (Netherlands), is dated ca. 1300, and is in the local Stedelijk Museum in Zutphen. #The astrolabe/almucantar quadrant – a quadrant developed from the astrolabe: This quadrant was marked with one half of a typical astrolabe plate as astrolabe plates are symmetrical. A cord attached from the centre of the quadrant with a bead at the other end was moved to represent the position of a celestial body (sun or a star). The ecliptic and star positions were marked on the quadrant for the above. It is not known where and when the astrolabe quadrant was invented, existent astrolabe quadrants are either of Ottoman or Mamluk origin, while there have been discovered twelfth century Egyptian and fourteenth century Syrian treatises on the astrolabe quadrant. These quadrants proved to be very popular alternatives to astrolabes. Geometric quadrant Geometric quadrant with plumb bob. The geometric quadrant is a quarter-circle panel usually of wood or brass. Markings on the surface might be printed on paper and pasted to the wood or painted directly on the surface. Brass instruments had their markings scribed directly into the brass. For marine navigation, the earliest examples were found around 1460. They were not graduated in degrees but rather had the latitudes of the most common destinations directly scribed on the limb. When in use, the navigator would sail north or south until the quadrant indicated he was at the destination's latitude, turn in the direction of the destination and sail to the destination maintaining a course of constant latitude. After 1480, more of the instruments were made with limbs graduated in degrees. Along one edge there were two sights forming an alidade. A plumb bob was suspended by a line from the centre of the arc at the top. In order to measure the altitude of a star, the observer would view the star through the sights and hold the quadrant so that the plane of the instrument was vertical. The plumb bob was allowed to hang vertical and the line indicated the reading on the arc's graduations. It was not uncommon for a second person to take the reading while the first concentrated on observing and holding the instrument in proper position. The accuracy of the instrument was limited by its size and by the effect the wind or observer's motion would have on the plumb bob. For navigators on the deck of a moving ship, these limitations could be difficult to overcome. Solar observations Drawing of a back observation quadrant. This instrument was used in the manner of a backstaff to measure the elevation of the sun by observing the position of a shadow on the instrument. In order to avoid staring into the sun to measure its altitude, navigators could hold the instrument in front of them with the sun to their side. By having the sunward sighting vane cast its shadow on the lower sighting vane, it was possible to align the instrument to the sun. Care would have to be taken to ensure that the altitude of the centre of the sun was determined. This could be done by averaging the elevations of the upper and lower umbra in the shadow. Back observation quadrant In order to perform measurements of the altitude of the sun, a back observation quadrant was developed. With such a quadrant, the observer viewed the horizon from a sight vane (C in the figure on the right) through a slit in the horizon vane (B). This ensured the instrument was level. The observer moved the shadow vane (A) to a position on the graduated scale so as to cause its shadow to appear coincident with the level of the horizon on the horizon vane. This angle was the elevation of the sun. Framed quadrant Large frame quadrants were used for astronomical measurements, notably determining the altitude of celestial objects. They could be permanent installations, such as mural quadrants. Smaller quadrants could be moved. Like the similar astronomical sextants, they could be used in a vertical plane or made adjustable for any plane. When set on a pedestal or other mount, they could be used to measure the angular distance between any two celestial objects. The details on their construction and use are essentially the same as those of the astronomical sextants; refer to that article for details. Navy: Used to gauge elevation on ships cannon, the quadrant had to be placed on each gun's trunnion in order to judge range, after the loading. The reading was taken at the top of the ship's roll, the gun adjusted, and checked, again at the top of the roll, and he went to the next gun, until all that were going to be fired were ready. The ship's Gunner was informed, who in turn informed the captain...You may fire when ready...at the next high roll, the cannon would be fired. In more modern applications, the quadrant is attached to the trunnion ring or of a large naval gun to align it to benchmarks welded to the ship's deck. This is done to ensure firing of the gun hasn't \\"warped the deck.\\" A flat surface on the mount gunhouse or turret is also checked against benchmarks, also, to ensure large bearings and/or bearing races haven't changed... to \\"calibrate\\" the gun. Customization During the Middle Ages, makers often added customization to impress the person for whom the quadrant was intended. In large, unused spaces on the instrument, a sigil or badge would often be added to denote the ownership by an important person or the allegiance of the owner.

In late December 1963, WMCA, with Spector, earned the distinction of being the first New York City radio station to play the Beatles' Capitol Records' single, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" (Outside New York, the single's broadcast debut is widely accepted to have occurred earlier at WWDC in Washington, D.C.) WMCA was keen on playing new product and breaking new hits, and consequently, Spector became associated with the radio station most credited for introducing Beatlemania - and the \\"British Invasion\\" musical movement - to New York City listeners. In 1969, while continuing to work as a DJ in New York, Spector released a single on Buddah Records under the name, \\"Vik Venus, Alias: Your Main Moon Man\\". The single, \\"Moonflight\\", was a novelty \\"break-in\\" record in the style of Dickie Goodman. In it, a reporter asks the astronauts questions about a fictional \\"Achilles moon flight\\", with the responses taken from snippets of popular songs of the day. All response fragments used for this record were from previous hits on Buddah. The record peaked at #38 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. WMCA moved to a talk format September 21, 1970, one day after the final top-40 broadcast. Spector stayed on as host of a sports talk show. In about 1971 Spector moved to WHN, then a vocal-based easy listening station. He remained for a while after WHN became a country music station in 1973. In 1974, Spector left WHN to go to WCBS-FM where he hosted a 1955-1964 based Oldies show called \\"The Saturday Night Sock Hop\\" and another regular weekend shift. He was also a full-time swing host there, filling in for various airstaffers over the years. In 1983, Cousin Brucie began doing every third Saturday night of the month. Spector remained at WCBS-FM until the Spring of 1985. In 1985, Spector was at WNBC as the original host of \\"Sports Night\\", eventually replaced by Dave Sims. He went then to WPIX-FM, which was playing an adult contemporary format. Upon their change to NAC and soon after to smooth jazz, he became one of the first air personalities on CD 101.9. Spector also owned a retail optical store when he was not on the air. Late in 1988, Spector left WQCD and joined the staff of WHLI at Hempstead, New York playing an Adult Standards format. That station began mixing in more rock and roll oldies by the early '90s. After a few Radio Greats Weekends at WCBS-FM, Jack Spector returned as a part-time swing announcer there in 1993 while working full-time at WHLI. On March 8, 1994, shortly after starting a recording of Louis Prima's \\"I'm In The Mood For Love\\", he suffered an apparent heart attack and collapsed to the floor. Following a long silence after the song had finished, radio station employees ran into the studio and found Spector on the floor. Attempts to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead at Winthrop University Hospital. He was 65. He is buried at Beth Moses Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.Jack Spector at Find a Grave NotesSources *Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 External links *Jack Spector Air Check March 1959 WPTR * Category:1928 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:American radio personalities Category:20th-century American musicians ","title":"Jack Spector"},{"id":"13352257","text":"Edward Hammond may refer to: *Edward Hammond (politician) (1812–1882), U.S. Congressman from Maryland, 1849–1853 *Edward Hammond (researcher) (born 1968), American biotechnology expert *Edward H.

The four were originally Johnson's eighth-grade pupils in an English class which he instructed in Odessa, also in West Texas, in the 1959-1960 school year. \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" (#46) and \\"Tonight (Could Be the Night)\\" (#50) made brief appearances in the UK Singles Chart in 1961. Their complete recorded output runs to thirty songs, which were collected on one compact disc and released on Ace Records in 1996. Aftermath Johnson was later a school principal before his death in February 2013. Clarence Rigsby was killed in an automobile accident in 1978.

It starts with a recording of a radio station teamed with emotional feedback then follows into the proper song. It is one of Satriani's most popular songs, and is still performed at all of his live concerts. Live versions can be found on the Live in San Francisco, Satriani Live!, and G3: Live in Concert albums. The intro heard was not planned, but was recorded nonetheless by producer John Cuniberti while recording Satriani's guitar parts for the song. Apparently, Satriani's amplifier was picking up a frequency from a radio or TV station, and Cuniberti simply said, \\"I'm recording this,\\" and proceeded. Amidst the recorded speech is a young boy's voice saying \\"sometimes afterwards they still like each other, and sometimes they don't.\\" The same excerpt is still used today when Satriani performs the song in concert. The acoustic rhythm guitar part is usually played as a backing track. Musically, the track strongly features the C Lydian mode, giving it a spacey-dreamy feeling. Also featured strongly in the track is Joe Satriani's fluid and complex usage of the legato technique to quickly play scalar runs. When played live, the intro feedback is produced by Satriani and then manipulated by physically moving himself and his guitar to different positions relative to his amplifier - this changes the frequencies of the feedback, giving an interesting array of variations on the initial feedback. Satriani knows where the harmonics are generated on each separate stage on tour by \\"mapping them out\\" during soundchecks and marking the physical points on-stage with tape.

Believers recommend that it be prayed after waking in the morning, and before going to bed, following the examination of conscience at night. This devotion has been recommended by St. Anthony of Padua, St. Alphonsus Liguori, St. John Bosco and St. Leonard of Port Maurice. Two saints, Mechtilde and Gertrude, are said to have received revelations from the Blessed Virgin Mary regarding this practice. History St. Anthony of Padua (1195-1231), one of the first to recommend this practice. The practice of reciting the Hail Mary three times dates at least to the 12th century. One of the first to practice and recommend it was St. Anthony of Padua (1195–1231). His purpose was \\"to honor the spotless Virginity of Mary and to preserve a perfect purity of mind, heart and body in the midst of the dangers of the world\\". The practice of saying three Hail Marys in the evening somewhere about sunset had become general throughout Europe in the first half of the fourteenth century and it was recommended and indulgenced by Pope John XXII in 1318 and 1327.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Angelus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 9 May 2013 Many saints have practiced and recommended the devotion of the \\"Three Hail Mary\\", such as, St. Leonard of Port Maurice, St. Bonaventure, St. John Berchmans, St. John Baptist Mary Vianney (Cure of Ars), St. Stanislaus Kostka, St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort, St. John Joseph of the Cross, St. John Baptist de Rossi, St. Gerard Majella, St. Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows, Blessed Marcellinus Champagnat, St. Alphonsus Liguori, St. Gemma Galgani, and St. Josemaría Escrivá.A prayer for purity of heart This practice was observed by Franciscans and eventually developed into the Angelus prayer. Revelations from the Blessed Virgin Mary St. Mechtilde of Hackeborn (1241-1299), a Benedictine nun of the convent of Helfta, experienced three visions of the Virgin Mary. Mechtilde was distressed over her eternal salvation and prayed to the Virgin to be present at the hour of her death. In these appearances, Mary reassured her, and taught her to understand especially on how the Three Hail Marys honor the three persons of the Blessed Trinity. The first prayer recalls the power she received from the Eternal Father to intercede for sinners, the second commemorates the wisdom received from the Son; and the third, the love she bears, filled by Holy Spirit. According to St. Gertrude (1256–1301), the Blessed Virgin Mary promised the following: \\"To any soul who faithfully prays the Three Hail Marys, I will appear at the hour of death in a splendor of beauty so extraordinary that it will fill the soul with heavenly consolation.\\" Madonna and Child with Angels, Duccio, 1282 One recommended method is as follows: O Mary, by thy pure and Immaculate Conception, make my body pure and my soul holy. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. O my Mother, preserve me this day from mortal sin. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. O my Mother, preserve me this day from mortal sin. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. O my Mother, preserve me this day from mortal sin. Other recommendations Later on, St. Leonard of Port Maurice \\"had the three Ave Marias recited morning and evening in honor of Mary Immaculate, to obtain the grace of avoiding all mortal sins during the day and night; moreover, he promised in a special manner eternal salvation to all those who proved constantly faithful to this practice.\\" Doctor of the Church St. Alphonsus Liguori (1696–1787) adopted this pious practice and highly recommended it. He told parents to train their children to acquire the habit of saying three Hail Marys in the morning and evening. After each Hail Mary, he advised that the following prayer be said: \\"By thy pure and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, make my body pure and my soul holy.\\" According to the St. Martha Catholic Church of the Pallottine Fathers, after Night Prayers: \\"Many saints have had the practice of adding three Hail Marys here in honor of Mary's purity for the grace of a chaste and holy life.\\" Thus, it has been recommended as a daily practice for people who have received the Sacrament of Confirmation that they pray the Three Hail Marys for \\"purity of mind, heart and body\\" after examination of conscience, before going to bed. Adaptations St. Virgilius Council 185, Knights of Columbus, in Newtown, Connecticut, initiated a Three Hail Mary's Prayer Drive in support of those affected by the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Council requested other Knights Councils and religious organizations to encourage the praying of one Hail Mary for the deceased and their families, one for first responders and teachers, and one for the community.\\"Three Hail Mary Prayer Drive\\", St. Virgilius Council, Knights of Columbus, Newtown, Connecticut It is a common practice for Catholics to offer three Hail Marys for any given problem or petition.

They soon dropped the '5' and became popular enough to release their first single, \\"My Party\\" for DynoVoice Records, composed and produced by label mate Mitch Ryder. With their reputation growing beyond the local scene, they were offered a contract by hit songwriter and producer Jeff Barry, who had started his own label, Steed Records.

Most research demonstrates articulatory suppression by requiring an individual to repeatedly say an irrelevant speech sound out loud while being presented with a list of words to recall shortly after. The individual experiences four stages when repeating the irrelevant sound: the intention to speak, programming the speech, articulating the sound or word, and receiving auditory feedback.  Phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad  When studying articulatory suppression, many researchers examine the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad as well. The phonological loop is the process of hearing information, which has direct access to one's phonological store (i.e. one's short-term memory). The visuospatial sketchpad is information that is seen (visual information), which only has access to the phonological store through one's articulatory control process (i.e. when visual information can be phonologically encoded). Essentially, articulatory suppression is related to these two topics because it is what prevents visual information from being encoded into the phonological store. A study done by Franssen, Vandierendonck and Van Hiel which addressed the question, to what extent is phonological working memory involved in time estimation processes. Their study used irrelevant speech and articulatory suppression to test whether time estimation is affected during a task condition or phonological load. The results showed that articulatory suppression had impaired time estimation. The results from this study tell us the effects of articulatory suppression and its involvement in the phonological loop.  Irrelevant speech  Much research has been done to assess the relationship between articulatory suppression and irrelevant speech. One within-groups research study in particular examined whether articulatory suppression has an effect on the ability to encode information into memory and the relationship that articulatory suppression has with the irrelevant speech effect. Irrelevant speech, in this experiment, consisted of words being played on a speaker during the study. Participants were shown seven letters in a row and then asked to repeat the order of the letter by pushing buttons on a screen. There were two phases to this study, and in Phase I, the participants were either asked to remain quiet while the letters were shown or to repeat \\"123\\" while the letters were shown. In Phase II, the irrelevant speech was either absent or played on the speakers. Results of this study concluded that memory performance was disrupted by both articulatory suppression and irrelevant speech, although the effect of articulatory suppression was larger. This is because they inhibit or eliminate the individual's ability to rely on the auditory cues that help encode information into memory. Another reason articulatory suppression inhibits memory performance more than irrelevant speech is because it prevents information from being represented in the mind and is unable to be rehearsed. In both phases, an overwhelming majority of participants did the best when the information was encoded in the quiet trial. This information could be helpful to everyone because it lends evidence to the statement that a quiet environment is the best environment for people to learn or commit any sort of information to memory. An additional study sought to determine what types of articulatory suppression reduce the strength of encoding items into an individual's memory. Researchers manipulated participants by engaging them in multiple kinds of articulatory suppression (i.e. some were rather easy, such as saying \\"the\\", and some were more difficult, such as spelling a word out loud) and showing them lists to remember. Results showed that articulatory suppression of any kind reduced the strength in which an individual encoded visual information into their memory. However, participants who were in the more difficult articulatory suppression group remembered much less of the list of words than did those with an easier articulatory suppression task. The reason for this finding is because if an individual is using more effort in remembering how to do something (i.e. spell a word), they are obligated to pay less attention to additional visual information that is presented at the same time. Hanley and Shah looked at the role of irrelevant sound effect under articulatory suppression. During this experiment, participants wore stereo headphones when being tested. During the testing, participants heard an experimental list of items through the right headphone spoken by a female voice. Participants were instructed to repeat the word \\"the\\" at a rate of approximately two repetitions per second. There was a retention interval of 10 seconds between the final item and the recall of target items. Irrelevant sound took place when a male voice was spoken in the left headphone throughout the retention interval, right before the recall of items. The results from this study showed that there was a significant effect of irrelevant sound under articulatory suppression when the list items were followed by an auditory tone, but the effect was abolished when followed by a spoken suffix.  In the real world  Articulatory suppression can have many relevant uses in the 'real world', especially when looking at people that are bilingual or learning a second language. Overall, researchers have found that the ability to memorize or recall anything while using articulatory suppression is significantly reduced. This is because the repeating of nonsense syllables prevents the individual from committing the information to memory. When learning languages, the ability to hear a word and then add that word to an individual's vocabulary is crucial to progressing in that language. Studies are being done to investigate the mechanism by which articulatory suppression inhibits that ability. With increased understanding of how that process works, improved learning and studying strategies may be able to be developed to help people with second languages or with other aspects of memory. One study looked at interpreters, their impressive working memories and the effects that articulatory suppression can have on their ability to translate and interpret language. Specifically, researchers wanted to look at the differences between simultaneous interpreting and articulatory suppression as they relate to working memory. To do this, thirty Dutch university students with English as a second language participated and were read a story in English and then were asked to translate to Dutch as they listened, but only translate the meaning, not the exact words. Then, another experiment was performed with the same participants. In this study there were two important variables that were under the control of the researcher: the articulatory suppression variable (no articulatory suppression, articulatory suppression or complex articulatory suppression) and whether the story that was read to the students was coherent or not. Participants in the articulatory suppression condition said \\"de, de, de\\" while the story was read and in the complex articulatory suppression condition, they said 'hond, kat, muis' (i.e. dog, cat, mouse) while listening to the story. After the story was read, each participant was told to recall and write down as much of the story as they could remember in exact wording. From this study, researchers came to the conclusion that articulatory suppression inhibits the ability for the participants to recall the story, as many other studies have shown. However, interpreters are somewhat immune to the effects of articulatory suppression. This could be because interpreters are quicker to transfer information to their episodic buffer, which may allow them to bypass the rehearsal that most people find necessary to retain information. Articulatory suppression interferes with rehearsal, which is why most people show poor recall when engaging in articulatory suppression.  Verbal overshadowing and face identification  A study by Wickham & Swift looks at the role that articulatory suppression can have on verbal overshadowing and face identification. Verbal overshadowing is the phenomenon that verbally describing a face between presentation and test can impair identification of the face (Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990). This study had the goal of looking to see how important verbal encoding is to face recognition and also how it interacts with verbal overshadowing by using articulatory suppression to force the individual to rely on their visual code instead of the phonological code. Participants were asked to perform a procedure that included studying a face carefully for five seconds. During these five seconds, they were repeating the word 'the'. Then, participants were either given one minute to write down a description of the face they just saw or were given a crossword puzzle to complete to distract them. Then, participants were shown ten faces, of which there were nine faces that were very similar and one face that was considered the target, or the one they just studied. This procedure was repeated twelve times for each participant. Researchers found several interesting conclusions from their study. First, they found that \\"articulatory suppression significantly reduced the identification scores of no description participants but not the description participants.\\" This means that articulatory suppression has an effect on facial identification in that it impairs one's ability to recognize a face. This study also found that when participants were using articulatory suppression, the verbal overshadowing effect did not occur. This would seem to suggest that the encoding of faces and the verbal overshadowing effect comes from a problem with the verbal code, not the visual code. Because having that distracter syllable did not hinder the individual's ability to recognize the face more than describing it did, it would not be a problem with disrupting what the participants encoded visually, but the verbal aspects that interferes and creates the verbal overshadowing effect. From these studies, it can be seen how this information can be used in everyday life to help understand and improve memory. As discussed before, the studies shown that information is best encoded when there is no auditory information to interfere with the rehearsal of the information. This could be helpful to students who like to listen to music while studying or to anyone trying to encode information. The second study suggests that the ability to simultaneously interpret language might enable individuals to bypass the effects of articulatory suppression. Perhaps researchers would be able to investigate if being multi-lingual helps with this or if there is some brain process that makes it easier for them to encode information to memory and therefore to learn multiple languages and then easily interpret between them. Lastly, the study regarding face recognition and identification reinforces the notion that articulatory suppression interferes with an individual's ability to encode information. Task switching In our every day-to-day life, articulatory suppression can affect our ability to switch between tasks. A study by Liefooghe, Vandierendonck, Muyllaert, Verbruggen and Vanneste looked at the role of articulatory suppression can have on task switching. During their study, they conducted three experiments. In the first experiment, participants were asked to sort cards and were instructed either to perform the task silently or to repeat the word \\"de\\". The results indicated that articulatory suppression affected how quick participants were to switching between the sorting tasks. The reaction time increased for participants who were under articulatory suppression compared to those who were not. The remaining two experiments also received results indicating articulatory suppression had an effect on task switching. Results from Saeki and Saito's study concluded the effect of articulatory suppression on mixing cost during task switching but not on the actual switch cost. Their study tested participants in their verbal representation in sequential task decisions. The results indicated the use of verbal representation is effective in sequential task decision, which could be affected by articulatory suppression. Saeki, Saito and Kawaguchi tested the effects of three concurrent task conditions on task switching (control, articulatory suppression, and tapping). The results obtained from their study concluded that articulatory suppression had a greater effect compared to the control and tapping conditions. From the current studies, one can see that articulatory suppression does affect the ability and reaction time in task switching conditions. Wallace, Silvers, Martin, & Kenworthy conducted experiments to see if individuals with autism use inner speech in task completion. The results from this study also provided information on the effect of articulatory suppression on task switching and completion. Further studies can look at the effect of articulatory suppression on certain professions and the correlations between their experience in task switching and the effect of articulatory suppression. False memories A study by Macé and Caza looked at the role of articulatory suppression on immediate false recognition. During their first experiment, they created two groups of participants randomly. Participants in both groups were asked to listen to a list of words through headphones; and were instructed to point to \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" during the second list in whether they recalled that word from the first list. Participants in the articulatory suppression group were instructed to count 1 to 10 during both presentations of the lists and until completion of responding to the second list. Results from this study indicated, the effects of articulatory suppression increased false recognition of mismatching words on the second list. A current study done by Van Damme, Menten and d'Ydewalle looked at the effects of articulatory suppression on explicit false memory. The study consisted of an experiment, which looked at the effects on explicit memory compared to implicit and veridical memory. The results of their study showed that articulatory suppression, during encoding information, eliminated implicit false memory and heightened explicit false memory. Results from both of these studies, indicate that articulatory suppression has an effect on how we retain information and in increasing our false recognition of memories. Further studies can look at how this effect can contribute to eyewitness testimonies and in recall of events. Effects on working memory A study by Hayes and Chenoweth looks at the role of articulatory suppression in working memory. The articulatory suppression condition group asked participants to repeat the word \\"tap\\" aloud to a metronome while they transcribed text. The control group had to tap their foot to the metronome as they transcribed the text. The results of the study indicated, that participants who were under articulatory suppression condition had a significant reduction in typing rate and significant increase in the number of uncorrected errors. In summary, this study shows how articulatory suppression interfered with verbal working memory. Working memory works with both phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad, in the study performed by Jalbert and Saint-Aubin. They looked at the effects of articulatory suppression on visual similarity recall for where and when. Their experiment consisted of participants placing a series of colored squares into their appropriate locations, as presented before. During the experiment, participants who experienced articulatory suppression were hindered by similarity in recalling the location of the colored squares. Information from both of these studies indicated that articulatory suppression has an effect on working memory in performing tasks. In the first study, the effects of articulatory suppression took place as participants transcribed text, which included using their working memory. In the second experiment, participants were asked to use their visuospatial sketchpad to recall the location of colored squares, but articulatory suppression took a great deal of their working memory in performing these tasks, which hindered participants.

The year-round park, which has approximately , straddles US 101, causing the narrowest point of its entire distance. Said to have the 9th largest tree of all remaining Coast Redwoods, it is known for swimming on the South Fork of the Eel River and day use in addition to 159 campsites. The park is named after Friend Richardson, the 25th Governor of California between 1923 and 1927. Current issue: road widening for commerce vs. preservation The first road through Richardson Grove, eventually to become US 101, was constructed in approximately 1915 and first surfaced, most likely with gravel and oil, in 1927. A proposed project to adjust the alignment of Route 101 both inside and outside park boundaries to accommodate industry standard-sized trucks in compliance with the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) has been in development by Cal Trans (Caltrans). STAA-compliant vehicles are currently prohibited north of Leggett, California on Route 101 through Richardson Grove State Park. The feasibility of constructing a four-lane bypass of Richardson Grove State Park was analyzed in 2001, but deemed infeasible. Some north coast businesses, whose success is tied to shipping out of the area, favor the project. According to Caltrans, 54 trees under in diameter, none of which are old growth redwoods, would be removed for the project (32 trees in the park and 24 trees outside of the park). Trees to be removed would not all be redwood, but would include Douglas Fir, Big Leaf Maple, Live Oak, Tan Oak, and Red Alder. A total of two redwoods would be removed within the park itself. There are several preservation groups against the currently proposed changes in the road alignment. One of these groups, the Save the Redwoods League, worked with the state to increase the park to around . Groups and community members against the project, whose website is entitled \\"Save Richardson Grove,\\" posit that the result of widening the highway may cause Humboldt County to become a casualty of unlimited commercial development. Some suggest, by removing redwoods from the grove, there would be adverse effects on the root systems of remaining massive old-growth redwoods, even causing death to unintended trees and habitat.

The alternate history is built upon two premises: the recent open existence of magical and supernatural species, primarily witches, vampires, and werewolves, with the human population; and the historical investment of Cold War military spending in genetic engineering as opposed to the Space Race, which resulted in the accidental release of a genetically modified tomato in the 1960s that killed a significant portion of the human population. The series is set approximately 40 years after this plague, referred to as ”The Turn“ within the series. The series is told in the first-person point of view of Rachel Morgan, a bounty hunter witch who works with local law enforcement agencies and faces threats both mundane and supernatural in origin. The series also focuses on Rachel's relationships with her partners, a living vampire and a pixy, as well as her personal relationships with males of different species.

Characters=Main characters Each of the main Hollows novels are written first-person from the perspective of Rachel Morgan exclusively. However, the collection of Kim Harrison's Hollows short stories published in 2012 (between A Perfect Blood and Ever After) as Into The Woods: Tales from the Hollows and Beyond, , include one short story each from the perspectives of the other four major characters: :* Undead in the Garden of Good and Evil (Ivy) :* Ley Line Drifter (Jenks) :* Million- Dollar Baby (Trent) :* The Bespelled (Al) In addition, the two graphic novel prequels which explore how Rachel Morgan and Ivy Tamwood first happened to work together — Blood Work, , and Blood Crime, — are both written first-person from the perspective of Ivy Tamwood. =Rachel Mariana Morgan= A 25-year- old witch-born, day-walking demon. She is an equal partner in the 'Vampiric Charms' freelance runner and security service that she founded with Ivy Tamwood (a living vampire) and Jenks (a pixy), all formerly with the vampire- run federal Inderland Security (IS) police service, although they now frequently work in collaboration with the human-run Federal Inderland Bureau (FIB) on special projects. The three live and work together in a small decommissioned stone church with attached garden and graveyard in the Hollows district of Cincinnati. Initially practicing only simple herb-based earth magic, as the stories progress Rachel must learn and master progressively more difficult ley line and even demon magic to do her job and protect the lives of her friends and family. Yet even as her power grows, Rachel never loses her moral center; she frequently risks her own safety to avoid harm to others. Rachel is the sole female survivor of the Rosewood Syndrome, a normally fatal genetic blood disorder that occurs only in witch children. Eventually, it is revealed that witches are in fact demons that have had their magical potential reduced by an ancient curse, and Rosewood Syndrome is the result of witch children being born with the full potential of demon magic. Described by Trent as \\"five-foot-eight inches of bothersome redhead\\",Into The Woods (HarperCollins, 2012), , page 288. Rachel has green eyes and shoulder-length frizzy hair which seems to have life of its own. With a lean, athletic build, she looks good in leather, but can also dress elegantly as required for work. Rachel appreciates the finer qualities of the male form and does not discriminate based on species. Her gift is improvisation under stress. Her mother, Alice, is still living, and she has one estranged older brother (Robbie) who escaped being born with Rosewood. Rachel's aura color is gold, like both Trent and Algaliarept. =Ivy Alisha Tamwood= A living vampire. She is an equal partner in 'Vampiric Charms' freelance runner and security service with Rachel Morgan (a witch) and Jenks (a pixy). A natural detective (compared with the more mercurial Rachel), Ivy's gift is organization and planning. Her personal mantra is restraint and control. Six feet tall, elegantly thin, and very pale, Ivy has long black hair and an Asian cast. She struggles with her vampiric nature on a lifelong and personal level after a deeply traumatic adolescence twisted by Cincinnati's ancient undead master vampire Piscary, which has left her plagued with guilt at past violence and an inability to separate blood from sex. Ivy trusts Rachel to find some way to save her soul. She is highly protective and deeply devoted to both Rachel and Jenks, whom she credits with helping her discover how to live a 'normal' life. As a bisexual vampire, she enjoyed long-time relationships with both Piscary's scion Kisten Felps, a male fellow survivor of the same nightmare she grew up with, and Piscary's young female lawyer Skimmer. She is also attracted to Rachel. Ivy's father is still a living vampire, but her mother is 'undead'. Ivy has one younger sister, Erica, a bubbly teenager whose innocence Ivy is determined to protect. She will kill to preserve those she loves. =Jenks= An eighteen-year-old pixy: a four-inch-tall flying man. Jenks is an equal partner in 'Vampiric Charms' freelance runner and security service, together with Rachel Morgan (a witch) and Ivy Tamwood (a living vampire). An intel and reconnaissance specialist, Jenks is a skilled saboteur, swordsman, and electronics expert. He is gifted with an acute sense of smell and hearing. He sees auras without needing second sight. Jenks backs up both Rachel and Ivy on their runs, but can and does provide lethal force as required against what he calls 'lunkers' (big people) as well as the six-inch and fearsomely carnivorous fairies, who are the natural and mortal enemies of pixies. Jenks' dragonfly-like wings change color with his emotional state due to changes in blood flow. With a wicked sense of humor, Jenks is a blunt speaker who is unafraid to say anything to anyone. Even though he looks like a healthy college-freshman-in-miniature with his athletic form, laughing green eyes, and curly bright blond hair, Jenks is nearing the end of his natural pixy lifespan. This was a major concern to both Rachel and Ivy until Rachel gave Jenks a curse to make him human-size to help protect Rachel on a road trip during a cold month. After he was returned to his normal size, he was rejuvenated and had a new lease on life, adding another 20 years. As the only married member of the team — Jenks and his wife Matalina are successfully raising 54 children (multiple-births being the norm with pixies. Their children's extraordinarily high survival rate is the result of what is in pixy terms a veritable \\"castle of oak\\"Into The Woods (HarperCollins, 2012), , page 227.—Jenks and his family live in a stump within the church's lush garden). Jenks unstintingly offers brash and unsolicited—but usually accurate—relationship advice to both of his work partners (Rachel in particular, as he thinks her relationships need \\"particular help\\") as well as anyone else who will listen. Jenks and his family move indoors into the old church sanctuary during the cold winter months to avoid hibernation, which normally results in several children dying. This allows them to provide on- site security for the whole building and grounds all year round, which also makes his family the first pixies in Cincinnati to experience snow. =Trenton Aloysius Kalamack= Billionaire businessman and politician, peculiarly mysterious for one of Cincinnati's most powerful citizens, whose global empire of legitimate businesses and public philanthropy serve as a front for drug-running and illegal genetic research activities. Not until late in the second book (The Good, the Bad, and the Undead) does Rachel discover Trent is secretly an elf, a species thought to have become extinct during the Turn: a 21st-century elven prince of pure blood, charged with healing the elven genome crippled during their ancient war in the Ever After with the demons. Breeds racehorses and hunters as well as maintaining a full pack of hounds — 'The Hunt' pursues two- as well as four-legged quarry — at his vast and heavily wooded estate, which also serves as his primary residence and global corporate headquarters; public tours are available. Trent shares a childhood history with Rachel that neither completely remembers, due to memory blockers in the water at the make-a-wish camp for dying children they both survived. His father was responsible for curing Rachel's Rosewood Syndrome. Orphaned as a teenager, Trent had two older siblings who failed to survive infancy. Though less than two years older than Rachel, Trent has been raised since birth by fellow elves his chief of personnel (the six-foot-ten-inch Jonathan Davaros) and chief of security (magic and martial arts master Quen Hanson) to use 'whatever means necessary' to ensure the survival and recovery of the elven people. Rachel and Trent have a love/hate relationship, because of his worldview that that End (preservation of his species) must justify the Means — even, if necessary, death. A brilliant, clever, and resourceful man ... but morally ambiguous. Trent is very attractive, tall, lean and athletically built, with baby-fine blond hair and green eyes. He employs his personal charisma and low melodious voice as effective weapons. =Algaliarept= (Also known as \\"Al\\" or \\"Gally\\".) An ancient demon at least 5,000 years old. In his own words, \\"a dealer in flesh and seducer of souls, skilled in training people in the dark arts enough to make them marketable, then abducting them when they made a mistake in order to sell them to his peers [demons] into an extended lifetime of servitude\\"Into The Woods (HarperCollins, 2012), , page 4. — a Purveyor of Fine Familiars. Personally remembers, with great bitterness and much hatred, the elf-demon war which transformed the formerly eden-like Ever After into a red hell and trapped the demons there forever. Survived slavery to an elf in ancient times, by killing his master. Still hates the elves with passion, today. Trapped an elf princess (Ceridwen Merriam Dulciate) for 1,000 years as his personal familiar and sex slave. Clever, resourceful, conniving, yet honorable enough in his own peculiar twisted way. Like all the surviving demons, has shape-shifted through spells for so many thousand years that he no longer remembers his original form. Takes particular pleasure in adopting whichever persona his current target fears most — whether male, female, or not even humanoid — pulled from that target's deepest subconscious. But his own personally preferred persona of self-representation is a ruddy skinned 18th-Century British nobleman, tall and powerfully built, with green crushed velvet tailcoat and white gloves. The one aspect he finds difficult to hide are his horizontally goat-slitted red demon eyes, so he frequently wears round blue-tinted glasses to disguise them. Had been married in ancient times, to a demoness named Celffnah. Background The series is set in an alternate history where supernatural beings live side-by-side with normal humans. According to this timeline, after the discovery of the DNA double-helix by James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, genetic manipulation becomes a possibility, changing several events in the history of this alternate universe. A virus nicknamed the T4 Angel virus attached itself to a flaw in the genome of a genetically manipulated tomato (its lab identification being T4 Angel tomato), and quickly spread around the world. As a result of the plague, all biogenetic research, including reverse engineering and genetic splicing, has been outlawed. Additionally, the human race has developed a cultural fear of tomatoes and tomato-based food products such as pizza sauce and tomato ketchup. The Turn The T4 Angel virus killed a quarter of the human population. Upon noticing the combined number of their various species now neared that of humanity, the supernatural species quickly seized the opportunity to make themselves known. The fact the structure of the civilization remained somewhat intact during \\"The Turn\\" is attributed to the fact many of the supernatural beings being in (or seizing) positions of power, including a vampire named Rynn Cormel acting as the president of the USA (but never sworn in). The supernatural beings are known as \\"Inderlanders\\". As laws and societies are dramatically changed by factors relating to these new sentient species, all levels of law enforcement in the United States break down. Two new organizations, the Inderlander Security service (consisting entirely of non- humans) and the Federal Inderlander Bureau (consisting entirely of normal humans), replace the former law enforcement agencies at all levels. The convention that allows both agencies to operate forbids Inderlanders from being on the F.I.B. payroll, although consulting jobs mostly are allowed. The Ever-after The Ever-after is a magical plane that existed outside the ken of normal humans until the Turn. The main pixy character, Jenks, describes it as \\"...a drop of time that got knocked out, sitting alone by itself with no past behind it to push it forward and no future to pull it along.\\" Concentrations of Ever-after energy are scattered across the normal plane and are called \\"ley lines.\\" Ley lines can be felt on the normal plane by magic users and the races that formerly dwelt in the Ever-after, such as the elves and witches. The only race that currently dwells in the Ever-after is that of the demons, having driven out the elves nearly two thousand years ago. Witches also formerly dwelt in the Ever-after but fled to the mundane plane approximately five thousand years ago. The Ever-after presented in the novels is referred to as the basis for the 'happily ever after' that often occurs at the end of modern fairy tales; due to mistranslation and omission, the factual \\"in the Ever-after\\" (referring to a place) became the figurative \\"happily ever after\\" (referring to time). The Ever-after, once a beautiful land filled with fog and forest, was destroyed by the imbalance of the Elf-Demon war, leaving a desert-like wasteland stinking of burnt amber. The Elf-Demon War We learn in Ever After that the war was caused by a break in the alliance between Elves and Demons. The Elves enslaved the Demons, and the Demons, in return tried to trap the Elves in the Ever-after. This led to them being bound there in yet another war, until the Elves migrated to reality. Supernatural Races The novels use Inderlander to refer to all of the supernatural beings that revealed themselves during the Turn. They are divided into two groups: those that are derived from humans and those that are non-human in origin. Inderlander (non-human) races *Witches: An Inderlander species and the primary practitioners of magic in reality who are a distinct species from humans, although almost phenotypically indistinguishable, and due to a different number of chromosomal pairs, hybrids with humans are impossible. Witches possess a life expectancy of 160 years and a preferred circadian rhythm in which they arise at noon. They are demographically the largest of the four major Inderlander species, although the least political. Most of the population is unaware that the race of witches is the result of a curse cast on demons by elves; they fled the Ever-After 5,000 years prior to the Turn, abandoning the realm to the demons and elves. Rosewood Syndrome is a consequence of the curse that created the witches which affects certain children who would otherwise be capable of kindling demon magic, and the disease, with only two exceptions resulting from illegal genetic medicine, invariably leads to an early death. Witches of low magic ability, generally due to a lack of education, are called warlocks. Witch and warlock have no gender connotation. *Demons: A highly aggressive race that dwells only in the Ever-After, although capable of traveling through the ley lines to reality, they are incapable of being in reality during the day or being on consecrated ground. They are portrayed as particularly litigious and avaricious. However, the strength of contracts relies almost solely on power and leverage, as demons have no respect for the rule of law. Furthermore, their economy is primarily based on favors and knowledge as currency. Their natural life expectancy is 160 years, but through biological renewal inherent in their magic they are virtually immortal. Their magic is a unique combination of earth magic and ley line magic, giving their curses the strength and permanence of the former and the quickness and adaptability of the latter. In an attempt to rid reality of Elves, past demons created the Ever-After but instead of jailing the Elves, the creation forged a link to it trapping themselves. Less than 500 demons are still alive, though this number is not readily known or revealed till the final book. The only known female demon alive is Newt, who is incredibly powerful and feared but suffers from insanity. Attempts of other demons to reproduce with Newt have been unsuccessful. In \\"Ever After\\" the demons' original appearance is described as slight, dark as midnight, with bat-like wings and cat-like features. **Surface Demons: These creatures are not truly demons, but are thought to be since they live on the surface in the Ever After and are dangerous. It is eventually revealed that these are actually the souls of the undead vampires. After a vampires first death, their soul leaves them and joins the other so-called surface demons in the Ever After. *Elves: A race that migrated from the ever- after nearly 2,000 years ago after engaging in several wars with the demons. The life expectancy of a full-blooded elf is given to be similar to a witch. However, few such elves remain as the elves, trying to preserve and restore their heritage, closely mingled and interbred with humans, which led to a massive die-off during the Turn as they fell susceptible to the Angel virus. They are widely believed to be extinct for most of the series, though there are around several ten thousand purebred Elves alive. Due to the demons magically manipulating and corrupting their DNA, elves have only been able to produce magically stunted children or children that die as toddlers, which is cured around mid series. They practice a unique form of magic often called \\"wild magic\\" as it is less easily controllable than witch-magic *Pixies: A small, humanoid race with a lifespan of 18–20 years that lives in gardens and has an intense rivalry with the Fairies due to a competition for resources. They have dragonfly-like wings and stand 4 inches tall. Their culture is traditionally centered around a nuclear family, scattering once a parent dies. They traditionally hibernate during the winter. Pixies have no legal standing, which they sometimes use to their advantage especially where laws are concerned. They rely mostly on the pollen from plants to survive. Pixies are extremely territorial, and will attack fairies or even other pixies who invade their territories. A dash of red indicates peace and allows pixies to travel unharmed through another pixie's territory. Except we later learn that to the Pixies of the western desert, that wearing too much red can also mean they are looking for a bride. *Fairies: A small race that lives in gardens and has an intense rivalry with the pixies. Their physical appearance includes butterfly- like wings, a height of six inches, and insectoid features. Fairies tend to eat insects and work as mercenaries, if and when, they interact with humans and the larger Inderlanders. Fairies likewise have no legal standing in society, which is also to their preference. They are a migratory species, traveling to Mexico during the winter. They look like pale grim reapers in their flowing white, almost ragged clothes made from spider silk. All of them without exception have white hair, the men keep it as long as the women. The women have smaller teeth and are somewhat shorter, but otherwise, they look the same. *Leprechauns: A small race (approximately the size of humans with dwarfism) that often grant wishes when captured though they usually offer no more than the minimum of three required by law. They have the ability to fabricate rainbows but are required to pay taxes for any gold at the rainbow's end. It is impossible to steal from a Leprechaun due to their ability to manipulate reality (normally used to grant wishes). *Trolls: A vaguely humanoid race that lives under bridges and can be a public nuisance as they eat the mortar that holds bridges together. Although most trolls cannot speak English, some have learned it. They are known for their sensitive senses and can draw water into themselves to increase their mass. They are willing to work with friendly humanoids. *Banshees: A long-lived female species, they prey upon the emotions of others, using the energy to feed. They hunt all creatures with auras, and as they would normally kill their prey are under many legal restrictions in order to control their hunting. Banshees typically hunt with care, selecting emotionally rich victims and often say harmful things to increase the emotional yield. The amount of emotion required for a banshee to become pregnant coupled with the lack of restraint young banshees have means that their numbers increase very slowly. This is not a major problem as banshees require territories and the reduced population can only support a small number. Once a banshee reaches maturity she no longer ages. *Gargoyles: A species that hunts at night, preying primarily on birds supplemented with iron and other metals. They prefer to live on consecrated ground and will roost there during the day. Leathery and light when active at night. As they age, they acquire the ability to stay awake during sunlight hours. Gargoyles have an intense connection with the ley lines and provide focus and other abilities when aiding witches or held captive by demons. Unbound gargoyles can pass unhampered through all protection circles. Once bound, a gargoyle can only pass through their bond-mate's aura, will live as long as their bond-mate and are sensitive to their bond-mate's actions and well-being. Like the troll, a Gargoyle can draw water into itself for extra mass. They can also manipulate heat. *Dryads: A type of nymph, most of the species had been wiped out in the industrial revolution, though there were some signs that they are coming back in the mountains—now that we weren’t cutting down hundred-year-old trees anymore. We only meet one in the series (so far), a dryad named Daryl, that has a relationship with Ivy and Glenn. *Nymph: A nymph is an inderland species that are identified with natural features such as mountains (oreads), trees and flowers (dryads and meliae), springs, rivers and lakes (naiads) or the sea (nereids). Though we only here mention of a dryad in the story so far. Derived from humansVampires= Vampires The vampire virus is the result of a demon curse granted to a man (and his descendants) who was afraid to die. ln this series vampires are similar to common portrayals of vampires, with some exceptions. Their saliva contains drugs that make the pain of a vampire's bite feel like pleasure, similar to the vampires of the Red Court in Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. Vampires can also sensitize their victim's bite so that only that vampire can affect the victim, leaving the victim mentally bound to that vampire. There are two kinds of vampires, living and undead. Living vampires are normal humans infected with the vampire virus. They are divided into two groups: high- and low-blood. Low-blood vampires are normal humans that have been infected by the bite of an undead vampire, and have only a small amount of the benefits the virus grants, such as increased strength and speed, as well as the craving for blood. When low-blood vampires die, be it of natural causes or otherwise, they simply die like any other humans, unless an undead vampire is there at their moments of death to bring them back as undead by giving its blood. Unlike traditional vampires, low-blood vampires don't have fangs and aren't pale. High-blood vampires are vampires who were born already infected by the virus, which has influenced their development in the womb. They have increased strength and speed, more so than low-blood vampires, but not as much as the undead; they do however have some abilities that the other kinds don't: living high-blood vampires are empathic and can \\"pull an aura\\" to influence, intimidate, or control others. They have sharper and slightly longer canine teeth than humans or low-blood vampires. They also have a greater craving for blood than low-blood vampires, but it is not essential to their existence. When high-blood vampires die, no matter the cause, they rise again as undead the next sundown. Their appearance as undead is more like traditional literary vampires such as Bram Stoker's Dracula, so they then have longer fangs and paler skin. When vampires become undead, they gain the full physical benefits of the vampire virus, but lose their souls and their ability to keep their aura in the process. They now have the ability to turn humans into vampires and bespell even unwilling hosts. Vampire society is regulated by master vampires, usually in control of the underworld in larger cities. Master vampires have a coterie called a camarilla, to which their followers and families belong, with a complex social hierarchy in which everyone is subordinate to someone else except master vampires, who are the kingpins of the vampire society. Vampires outside of a camarilla often look to become part of one, as a camarilla serves as a support group for the lifestyle demanded by vampires. As for weaknesses, while low- and high-blood living vampires are immune to sunlight or holy items, they can be killed in any normal way: weapons, diseases, poisons, age, and so on. On the other hand, undead vampires have all the traditional vampire weakness: stakes, sunlight, holy items, silver, fire, and decapitation. However, in the Hollows series there is one original weakness: sharing the blood of another undead vampire will result in death =Weres= Weres are lycanthropes with bestial attributes who are otherwise human in appearance. According to legend, the origin of the Weres lies in a demon's curse upon a group of humans. The demon used a spell to turn into a wolf, then proceeded to have intercourse with them, and werewolves were the result. The common presentation of Weres in the novels is that of a traditional werewolf although werefoxes have appeared. Reportedly, the main difference between werewolves and werefoxes is werefoxes can control the size they turn, while werewolves' sizes are converted over from their human weight and relative size. Also, werefoxes are descended from elves rather than humans, which may explain their size-changing ability. In society, Weres live and operate much as natural wolves do: they form packs with alpha pairs, betas, etc., and there are also loners as well. It is not uncommon for them to date outside their species early in life. There is no \\"werewolf curse\\" as presented in other lycanthrope stories. Instead, Weres must rely upon breeding to increase their numbers, unless under an external influence. In the series, legends tell of a demonic device which allows Weres to turn a human by bite. The story tells that this device, called the \\"Focus\\", once used to play a major role in their political structure, revolving around who controlled it. The legend stated that over five thousand years ago, the focus-empowered Weres planned to convert humanity by force. However, the witches crossed over to reality from the Ever-after around that time; driven by self-preservation, the vampires, humans, and witches banded together to remove the Focus and its influence from the Weres' possession. It was said to have been destroyed, but was only kept in hiding. The Focus plays a role in the middle books of the series. Unlike vampires, Weres can enter holy ground but choose not to because of their beliefs. They are apparently vulnerable to silver. Ghosts and Spirits The existence of ghosts and spirits is made plain by references to fears by characters. Ghosts are disembodied souls that are in limbo have not \\"moved on\\" according to the series mythos. One character is the ghost of a dead witch. He is released from purgatory when his tombstone is cracked. Later he is given corporeal form through a deal with a demon. Gods and Goddesses Although many claim none exist, religious artifacts have a great deal of power and several characters of note are religious. It is suggested that it was not unusual for Inderlanders to convince humans to worship them. The Trickster Goddess, the Goddess of Wild Magic, is one who appears in the story. Her laughter or her gaze often accompanies Wild Magic. Many wielders often feel that promises of moral behavior to the Goddess allow them skill in wielding wild magic.  Magic  There are four known branches of magic in the novels, earth magic, ley line magic, demonic magic, and wild magic. All magic draws its power from ley lines, sources of energy that are scattered across the surface of the world. A magic user is labeled as either white or black, depending upon how the magic affects his or her soul. White magic is not damaging to the practitioner's soul, while black magic is. The stain upon the magic user's aura (energy emanated from the soul and that which protects one's soul) depends on how much the magic distorts the natural and causes an imbalance. The stain or smut, named because it appears as a black layer covering the aura, can be fostered off onto another but cannot be destroyed. Earth magic Earth magic filters ley line energy through plants and animals and, although slower than ley line magic, is just as powerful. It is associated with living things, potions, amulets, and charms. Spells can sometimes be stored and called upon later. Earth magic can actually alter one's physical appearance or shape. The effects are permanent unless doused in saltwater. Earth magic tends to be associated with white magic users since it is more difficult to gain access to the materials necessary for black earth magic. Black earth magic involves the sacrifice of animals and, in some cases, humans or Inderlanders. Ley line magic Ley line magic has less permanence than earth magic, but is much faster and more easily adaptable. Power can be drawn directly from a ley line or through an animal familiar. The energy is either channeled using a focus object or what is referred to as \\"wild magic\\" in which the power is imprecisely directed by the magic user that drew on the line. Ley line magic can only alter perception and not physical form like earth magic. Demonic magic Demonic magic combines ley line magic and earth magic to create something very fast, very powerful, and everlasting. As its name implies, demonic magic is practiced almost entirely by demons. Demons also use familiars, but instead of animals, they use sentient species such as witches, elves, and humans. This type of magic is extremely powerful and can be used to change one's species and cause huge amounts of damage. For example, a demonic curse can allow a being to \\"Were\\" (change into an animal), retain cognition of the original being, yet continue its life as the animal who can even have offspring. Because of the perversion of the laws of physics that demon magic embodies, the cost of this type of magic is extremely high, so much so that demons try to foster off the cost onto their familiars or other willing parties. Witches with the gene to wield demonic magic were cursed long ago by the elves so that any witch with the genetic mutation usually dies before his or her first birthday from Rosewood Syndrome. Only two witches have been seen to practice demon magic: Stanley Saladan and Rachel Morgan. It is later revealed that Rachel Morgan and Stanley Saladan, while the children of witches, are genetic demons. Wild magic Wild magic, also known as Elven or Celtic magic, incorporates a religious system grounded in nature and practised by Elves. Wild magic is powerful but unpredictable, almost alive at times. It will do the task it is meant to do, but the how is unpredictable and dependent upon the Trickster Goddess. Wild magic uses singing when cast, often accompanied by the Goddess's laughter.

The developers who proposed PGCC hoped to use divided between two five-star hotels, a Penang performing arts centre, a retail complex, divided between two office towers, of residential properties, a world-class convention centre, a observatory tower, of parking space, monorail transportation, and a public arena. Following public opposition due to an undemocratic decisionmaking process, no environmental assessment, and concerns about the impact on Penangites, the PGCC plan was blocked. The PGCC, with an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM25 billion, was to be sited on a 104 ha plot where the Penang Turf Club currently stands. Abad Naluri bought the land for RM488mil in 2002. The PGCC was designed by Asymptote Architecture, under leadership of Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Coutur. It was to be built on a 185 hectare plot (1.9 square KM), featuring two iconic towers – each standing high. It would have taken at least 15 years to complete. Basic Information * Retail Complex: 384.953 m². * Convention Center: 95.174 m². * Penang Performing Arts Center (PenPAC): 73.950 m². * Condominium Towers: 61.718 m². * Hotel A and Service Apartments: 23.130 m². * Hotel B and Service Apartments: 25.725 m². * Offices: 22.530 m². * Observatory: 1,256 m². * Parking: 183,390 m². Controversy and criticism The development of PGCC was criticised as misleading and lacking in transparency. The controversy ultimately led to the widespread PGCC boycott campaign, and to the plan being put on hold. Petitions, banners and other digital media were launched by the local community to raise awareness of the impact of the PGCC development to the public. In early September 2007, a few major non-governmental organisations in Penang joined forces to form The PGCC Campaign Group to oppose the development of Penang Global City Centre (PGCC) Project. However, the group is facing a mainstream media blackout. The group identified several issues surrounding the development. PGCC's developers also have been criticised for not providing details about their claims of a 'zero carbon' rating. Brochures and official website. produced by the developer only showed two towers. Residential properties with over 37 buildings was not highlighted in any official publication by the developers. Response of local authorities The Penang Island Municipal Council and the Penang state government under the previous administration have been reluctant to demand any public accountability or organise public hearings. None of the Penang citizens except for 16 representatives of the Residents Association of Jesselton were invited for a closed door meeting. The Penang State Local Government Committee chairman Datuk Dr Teng Hock Nan rejected the NGOs' proposal for public hearing. He claimed the council had already played its part in accordance with the law. Those present included MPPP president Datuk Zainal Rahim Seman, project developer Equine Capital Bhd executive chairman Datuk Patrick Lim and 16 representatives from the Residents Association of Jesselton. Following the 13th General Election on 8 March 2008, the new state government led by Pakatan Rakyat announced in September 2008 that the proposed PGCC project has been rejected by the Penang Municipal due to the failure of the developer in submitting the layout plans on time and complying with the council's requirements. This was confirmed by the council president Datuk Zainal Rahim Seman.

Menander, living in a city with a considerable population of Hellenized Jews,Jewish Encyclopedia: \\"Ephesus\\". also seems to have written on the history of the Jews, often cited by Josephus. Sources The only extant sources for the writing of Menander are citations of his work found in Josephus's two works Antiquities of the Jews and Against Apion, or in extracts from Josephus's works found in later writers. These later writers were Theophilus of Antioch, Eusebius of Caesarea, and George Syncellus. William BarnesWilliam H. Barnes, Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1991) 40. lists the following sources that scholars use to reconstruct the text of Menander: *Codex Laurentianus, 10th or 11th centuries AD, has the earliest Greek manuscript for Against Apion, but Barnes (p. 70) says it is \\"faulty in many respects.\\" *There is an Old Latin version of Josephus's citations of Menander in the writings of Cassiodorus. *Menander's list of kings from Abibaal, father of Hiram I, to Pygmalion, as taken from Against Apion 1.18, is found in the \\"To Autolycus\\" of Theophilus of Antioch. *All Greek manuscripts of Eusebius's Chronography have been lost, but an Armenian translation has virtually the entire text. *Fragments of Eusebius's Chronography are found in later Greek writers. *Greek excerpts from the Chronography are found in Syncellus. Contents of surviving extracts of Menander The exact title borne by Menander's lost work is not made clear by Josephus, who gives the following descriptions when he cites Menander: \\"Menander also, one who translated the Tyrian archives out of the dialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language\\" (Ant. 8.5.3). \\"Menander when he wrote his Chronology, and translated the Archives of Tyre into the Greek language\\" Ant. 9.14.2. \\"Menander wrote the Acts that were done both by the Greeks and Barbarians, under every one of the Tyrian Kings\\" (Against Apion 1.18). Josephus only cited Menander as a means to authenticate themes of his own writings. One such theme was the antiquity of the Jewish people, for which Josephus summoned Menander and several other non-Jewish historians to support his case. In terms of chronology, the earliest event to which Josephus calls Menander as his witness is the reign of Solomon. In Ant. 8.5.3, Josephus describes the help that Hiram, king of Tyre, provided for the building of Solomon's Temple. A description of Hiram's building projects in Tyre is then quoted from Menander in order to show the historicity of the Hiram mentioned in the Bible. A few other details about Hiram are added, including an exchange of riddles between Solomon and Hiram. In Ant. 8.13.2, the drought in Israel in the days of Elijah (1 Kings 17 and 18) is equated, by Josephus, with a drought that Menander said occurred in the days of Ethbaal (Ithobaal I, 878-847 BC), king of the Tyrians. In Ant. 9.14.2, after relating that Shalmaneser V was responsible for the destruction of Samaria (2 Kings 17:3-6), Menander is cited as bearing witness to the existence of Shalmaneser. Here Menander says that the king of Tyre during this time was named Eluleus, who reigned 36 years, and who successfully endured a siege of five years started by Shalmaneser. To historians, the most interesting portion of Menander's writing that has been preserved in found in Against Apion 1.18. Here Josephus again demonstrates the antiquity of his nation, as attested by historians outside his own national tradition. Bringing up Solomon and his contemporary Hiram, Josephus cites Menander's list of the kings of Tyre from Abibalus (Abibaal), father of Hiram, down to Pygmalion, with the years of reign of each king, as well as the years of their life. For Pygmalion, it is related that \\"he lived fifty-eight yearsSome manuscripts give 56 years (Barnes, Studies 42,43). and reigned forty-seven. It was in the seventh year of his reign that his sister took flight, and built the city of Carthage in Libya.\\"Josephus, Against Apion in Loeb Classical Library, tr. H. St. John Thackeray (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1956). Some manuscripts give 56 years for Hiram's lifespan instead of 58. After ending his quotation from Menander with this sentence, Josephus summarizes Menander's list of kings as follows: > The whole period from the accession of Hirom (Hiram) to the foundation of > Carthage thus amounts to 155 years and eight months; and, since the temple > at Jerusalem was built in the twelfth year of King Hirom's reign, 143 years > and eight months elapsed between the erection of the temple and the > foundation of Carthage. For a discussion of the importance of this passage in establishing the chronology of the kings of Tyre, see below, and also the Pygmalion and Hiram articles. Modern evaluations of Menander's writings=Evaluations based on literary analysis Some modern historians have considered Josephus's ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question that they were addressing was whether Josephus's quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and words into someone else's mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate that this was not the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary. > Dius [another Hellenistic historian cited by Josephus] calls Solomon \\"the > sovereign of Jerusalem\\" (ho turannos Ierosolumon) while Menander refers to > him as \\"the king of Jerusalem\\" (ho Ierosolumon basileus). This appellation > is clear proof of the Tyrian source of these passages, for the kings of the > Phoenician coast, who ruled principally over one city, looked upon Solomon > as a monarch of a city, like themselves; nor did Josephus correct this > \\"flaw\\", even in an account where he endeavors to exalt the greatness of > Solomon. Great weight must be attached to the testimony of Dius and Menander > as cited by Josephus, for these are the only mentions of Solomon's name in a > foreign source—perhaps a Tyrian source that stems from the time of Solomon > himself!H. Jacob Katzenstein, The History of Tyre (Jerusalem: Goldberg's > Press, 1973) 79-80. The author of this passage, Jacob Katzenstein, makes two other comments that suggest that Josephus was not merely putting forth his own writing and ideas under Menander's name: > The regnal years and the life-spans of the rulers are not given in round > numbers, so there is no reason to doubt the veracity of this tradition. > Moreover, Josephus does not digress from listing the kings of Tyre even to > comment on Ethbaal (Ithobal), the father-in-law of Ahab, although he is > mentioned in the Bible.Katzenstein, History of Tyre 80-81. Commenting further on the form in which Josephus presents the years of the kings in the Against Apion passage, William Barnes writes: > Indeed, the numbers appear to be taken directly from some sort of formulaic > archival source or king list, which gave only the life span and regnal total > for each king of Tyre plus brief remarks pertaining to his dynastic status > (cf. the seemingly superfluous retention [at least for Josephus' purposes] > of the numbers for the life spans of the various kings).Barnes, Studies 34. The literary conventions mentioned by these historians have therefore led them to the position that Menander's actual words, not just Josephus's own ideas, are to be found in the various texts where Josephus says he is citing Menander. Evaluations based on inscriptional evidence Josephus's citations of Menander contain references to Shalmaneser (V), Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, kings of Assyria that are well known both from Biblical texts and also from numerous Assyrian inscriptions. More important, however, for the question of the historicity of the Menander texts is his mention of kings who were not so famous, especially those for whom there had been no evidence outside Menander until fairly recent times. *In Against Apion 1.18, Menander names Balazeros as the grandfather of Pygmalion. Frank Moore CrossF. M. Cross, \\"An Interpretation of the Nora Stone,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 208 (Dec. 1972) 17 n. 11. and other scholars have equated this Balazeros (Baal-Eser II) with (Ba‘l-mazzer) who gave tribute to Shalmaneser III in 841 BC (see the Baal-Eser II article for details). *Against Apion 1.18 also mentions Pygmalion as a ruler of Tyre, relating that his sister Dido fled from him in his seventh year, 155 years after the beginning of the reign of Hiram I. A 9th-century BC inscription found on Sardinia apparently names Pygmalion, as described in the Pygmalion article.Cross, Nora Stone 13-19. *In Ant. 9.14.2, Menander, as cited by Josephus, mentions Eluleus as refusing to pay tribute to Sennacherib (725-722 BC), whereupon the Assyrians unsuccessfully besieged Tyre for five years. The conflict with Sennacherib with \\"Luli,\\" king of Tyre, is corroborated by at least three inscriptions of the Assyrian monarch.James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 287-288. Historians generally equate the name \\"Luli\\", in Sennacherib's Akkadian, with the Greek form Eluleus. These inscriptional evidences for lesser-known kings not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible have therefore been taken as lending credence to Menander's writings. For each of them, the time frame that Menander assigns to them is in agreement with the time assigned to their inscriptional evidence by modern historians. Evaluations based on the time from Hiram to Pygmalion As cited above from Ant. 1.18, Menander gave 155 years from the first year of Hiram's reign until the seventh year of Pygmalion, at which time Pygmalion's sister Dido, also known as Elissa, fled from Tyre, after which she founded Carthage in North Africa. This reference in Menander is unique not only for its chronological correlation of the time between Hiram and Pygmalion, but also because virtually all texts of Josephus/Menander that have come down to us, including the citations of Josephus's work in other writers, have preserved this total of 143 years and eight months from the start of construction of Solomon's Temple, in the 12th year of the reign of Hiram (Against Apion 1.18/126), until Dido's flight. This is in contrast with the lengths of reign for the individual monarchs between Hiram and Pygmalion, for which there is considerable variance in the copies of the various texts. But the overall figure of 143 years has been preserved by a fortuitous circumstance: it is repeated in three instances in Josephus, and in one of these instances it is not given as simply 143 years, but as 155 years from the start of Hiram's reign until the time that construction began for the Temple, which was in Hiram's 12th year (Against Apion 1.17,18). This triple redundancy has preserved the total of years from Hiram to Dido as originally recorded, even though the various extracts of Menander found in Josephus, Eusebius, Syncellus, and Theodotion disagree in other matters, due to the error of copyists through the centuries of written transmission. Modern historians therefore have generally given considerable credibility to this figure, using it to measure back 155 years from the date for the founding of Carthage in order to arrive at the regnal years of Hiram. =Menander's date for construction of Temple= The problem with this calculation, however, lay in determining which date to use for the founding of Carthage. Here, classical authors gave two years: 825 BC as given by Pompeius Trogus, or 814 BC as given by Timaeus. Although earlier historians generally preferred the 814 date, the publication of an inscription of Shalmaneser III relating the receipt of tribute from Ba’li-manzer of Tyre (apparently Baal-Eser II, grandfather of Pygmalion) in 841 BC has caused many scholars such as Frank M. Cross to favor the 825 date, because that date was consistent with the best texts of Menander for the reign lengths of Baal-Eser and his son Mattan I, whereas the 814 date was in conflict with these texts. Joachim Peñuela has argued that the 825 B.C. date of Pompeius Trogus and the 814 B.C. date of Timaeus and other writers are both correct when properly understood. Based on a citation from Strabo (17.3.14-15) plus a fragmentary ancient Greek text describing Dido's various time-consuming activities after she left Tyre but before the people of North Africa granted her permission to build a city, Peñuela contends that eleven years elapsed between her flight and the foundation (or possibly, dedication) of the city, thus explaining the apparent discrepancy between Trogus and Timaeus in this matter.J. M. Peñuela, \\"La Inscripción Asiria IM 55644 y la cronología de los reyes de Tiro,\\" Sefarad 14 (1954): 28-29 and nn. 164-67. For a fuller discussion, see the Pygmalion article. Accepting that 825 BC was Pygmalion's seventh year and the ending point of the 155 years, Hiram's first year becomes 825 + 155 = 980 BC. His twelfth year, the year in which Temple construction began, would then be 968 BC. There is some slight uncertainty here because neither Josephus, Menander, or Pompeius Trogus, in the texts that have come down to us, relate which calendar they were using for reckoning the years: Roman, Macedonian, or Phoenician. But this consideration would not make a difference of more than a year or two, so that Barnes states, > [F]or the present we may conclude quite confidently that the Tyrian king > list of Menander as preserved in Josephus' Contra Apionem [Latin for Against > Apion], 1:117-26, coupled with the dated reference in Shalmaneser's annals > to the Tyrian king Ba'li-manzer and the date of Pompeius Trogus for the > founding of Carthage, provide a firm external synchronism for biblical > chronology, and particularly for the dating of the founding of Solomon's > temple in 968 (the twelfth year of Hiram of Tyre), as well as the dating of > Solomon's accession to 971.

Assigning a date to this in modern terms depends on determining a date for the death of Solomon and the subsequent division of the kingdom. The date of the division of the kingdom was calculated by Edwin Thiele as occurring some time between the first of Nisan (roughly April) of 931 BC and the day before Nisan 1 of 930 BC. Thiele's logic in this matter was based on fixed dates for the presence of Ahab at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC and Jehu's tribute to Shalmaneser III in 841 BC. Thiele showed that when non-accession years were assumed for the northern kingdom of Israel and accession years were assumed for the southern kingdom (Judah), the regnal lengths of both kingdoms, as measured back from the Battle of Qarqar, produced the same result of 931 BC for the first year of the divided kingdom.Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1981) 78. Furthermore, the extensive cross-synchronisms between the two kingdoms for these 78 years all worked out exactly, giving extra support for the credibility of the Biblical records that allowed this calculation of 931/930 for the division of the kingdom. Thiele's logic in this matter has been acknowledged by a broad spectrum of historians of the Bible and the ancient Near East, and is accepted in the Cambridge Ancient History and in much of recent scholarship.T. C. Mitchell, \\"Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.),\\" Cambridge Ancient History 3, Part 1, 445-446. For a partial list of other scholars who accept 931/30 for the division of the kingdom, see the Edwin R. Thiele article in Wikipedia. Thiele established that the northern kingdom of Judah measured its regnal years from the fall month of Tishri, the month in which Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, continues to be celebrated in modern times.Thiele, Mysterious Numbers 51-53. Thiele's logic for determining the year of the division of the kingdom was built on reckoning in Nisan-based years, such as were used in the northern kingdom. Solomon's 40th or last year, then, since it was reckoned according to a Tishri-based year, could have begun either in Tishri of 932 or Tishri of 931 BC. Thiele assumed the latter, which led him into conflicts with the later reigns of Ahaziah and Athaliah that he never resolved. These conflicts disappear when it is assumed that Solomon's 40th year began in Tishri of 932. Leslie McFall, a foremost interpreter of Thiele's work, now accepts the results of a 2003 study by Rodger YoungRodger C. Young, \\"When Did Solomon Die?\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 46:4 (2003) 589-603. demonstrating that the Biblical data require that Solomon's last year began in Tishri of 932 BC instead of Tishri of 931 as given by Thiele.Link to McFall's web site that indicates this change from his previous reckoning that followed Thiele for the reign of Solomon: F. M. Cross and his student Wm. H. Barnes had also arrived at the date of 968/67 BC for the beginning of construction of the Temple, based solely on the Tyrian data of Menander. Unknown to Moore and Barnes, in the 1920s the Belgian scholar Valerius Coucke had likewise deduced that construction on Solomon's Temple began in 968/67 BC, based on the same Tyrian data used by Moore and Barnes, but also utilizing information from the Parian Marble and other classical sources to confirm and refine this date.V. Coucke, \\"Chronologie biblique\\" in Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible, ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1 (Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), cols. 1245–79.Rodger C. Young, \\"The Parian Marble and Other Surprises from Chronologist V. Coucke,\\" Andrews University Seminary Studies 48 (2010): 225-49.Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, \\"Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies,\\" Journal for the Evangelical Study Study of the Old Testament, 1:2 (2012) 2-8 . These chronological considerations date Solomon's fourth year as beginning in the fall of 968 BC, so that Temple construction began in the following spring, 967 BC. This is an additional demonstration of the trustworthiness that can be assigned to Josephus's citations of Menander, whose writings were used by the scholars listed above to date the beginning of Temple construction in 968/67 BC. In particular, it authenticates the 155 years measured back from Dido's flight to the start of the reign of Hiram, since the method of determining the date for the start of construction of Solomon's Temple as derived from Menander of Ephesus is \\"wholly independent\\"Barnes, Studies 31. of the means of deriving this date from the Biblical data. For many modern scholars, the agreement of these two methods, exact within one year, has caused a new appreciation of the works of the ancient historian Menander, as preserved in the writings of Josephus.

The auditorium played host to early meetings of Hillsong Church before the group moved to a purpose-built facility nearby. The Entertainment Centre foyer was dominated by a large mural: a Cubism-inspired work depicting various aspects of the performing arts, made up of thousands of ceramic pieces. The mural was the work of local artist Vladimir Tichy, who maintained a studio on the premises of a local brickworks.

The station would have been on the site of the Castle Hill Showground, which would have faced demolition as a result. After the New South Wales Government determined to proceed with the NWRL in 2011, community feedback led to the station being shifted from the showground site, which had heritage significance, to the Hills Centre site opposite. The station was renamed Hills Showground as a result. Despite some local opposition to the change – the Hills Centre was of particular significance to a generation of school students who had performed there over the years – the site was compulsorily acquired by Transport for NSW in 2013.

School performances shifted to the Hillsong Centre, Parramatta Riverside Theatres and other venues. The station opened as part of Sydney Metro Northwest in May 2019.

From 11 August 1846 to 1855, he held the vicarage of Tardebigge in Worcestershire, and from 1854 to 1868, he was an honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral. On the nomination of William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, he was appointed to the rectory of Honiton, Devonshire, in 1855, and as such was responsible for the management of Honiton grammar school. This preferment he retained until his appointment to the episcopal bench, holding with it from 1858 a prebendal stall in Exeter Cathedral, and from 1867 the adjoining vicarage of Monkton. In 1866, he was elected as proctor in convocation for that diocese, but lost his seat in 1869 through declining to oppose the disestablishment of the Irish church. By the recommendation of William Ewart Gladstone, he was appointed to the see of Oxford, being consecrated bishop on 25 January 1870, and invested as Chancellor of the Order of the Garter on 5 February 1870. He discharged the duties of that see until 1888, when failing health compelled him to retire, his resignation taking legal effect on 17 November 1888. He died at Angus House, Eastbourne, Sussex, on 16 September 1889, and was buried on 21 September in Sandhurst Churchyard, Berkshire. He had become a Doctor of Divinity (DD). Assessment As a bishop, Mackarness was fearless and independent, without any trace of affectation, and the sermon which Ince (a professor) preached at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 22 September 1889, and afterwards published, bore public witness to the regard which the clergy of his diocese had for him. When an attempt was made to force him to take proceedings against the rector of Clewer, he argued the case in person before the judges of the queen's bench division. Judgment went against him, but on carrying the case to the court of appeal it was given in his favour, and this decision was confirmed by the House of Lords. A liberal in politics, he voted in the lords against the Afghan war and the Public Worship Regulation Act, while he supported the bill for allowing dissenters to be buried in churchyards with services from their own ministers, and the measure for the removal of religious tests in the universities. On surrendering to the ecclesiastical commissioners the management of the Oxford bishopric estates, Mackarness, with singular honesty, paid to them the sum of £1,729, being the estimated amount which he had received therefrom in excess of his statutory income during the previous nine years. Family He married Alethea Buchanan Coleridge on 7 August 1849 at Ottery Saint Mary, Devon, daughter of Sir John Taylor Coleridge. She was born in 1826 in London and died on 30 March 1909.Mrs. Mackarness The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 31 Mar 1909; pg. 13; Issue 38921. Her parents were John Taylor Coleridge and Mary Buchanan. Together they had eight children; one of whom was Frederick Michael Coleridge Mackarness a prominent barrister then judge who also served as the Liberal MP for the Newbury constituency between 1906 and 1910. Another son, Charles won the FA Cup with Oxford University in 1874, before going on to have a long career in the church, becoming Archdeacon of the East Riding from 1898 to 1916. Works Mackarness was the author of numerous sermons and charges, and until his elevation to the see of Oxford he regularly contributed to the 'Guardian.' His chief publications were : * 'A few Words to the Country Parsons on the Election for Oxford University. By One of Themselves,' 1847. * 'A Plea for 'toleration, in Answer to the No Popery Cry,' 1850. * 'May or Must,' a letter to Alfred Pott, Archdeacon of Berkshire, 1879. With Richard Seymour he edited in 1862 a volume called 'Eighteen Years of a Clerical Meeting, being the Minutes of the Alcester Clerical Association, 1842–60,' and a sermon by him on the death of Lord Lyttelton, to whom he was for some time honorary chaplain, appeared in 'Brief Memorials of Lord Lyttelton,' 1876.

Uli town extends westward to the confluence of the rivers of Atamiri and Enyinja, and across Usham Lake down to the lower Niger region. The history, life, culture and custom of Uli people can be found in many texts with the most elaborate one being the book titled URI History, Life, Culture & Custom of a People and written by Ichie (Sir) G.C. Okonkwo. Anambra State University is located in Uli. During the Biafran Civil War, the Biafran Airport code-named Annabel Airport was also located in a land strip at Umuchima village, Uli. This landing strip was used extensively to bring in relief supplies during the Biafran airlift. Uli as a community can be traced back to the great ancestral tree of The Okolie's who remain prominent figures in the historical outline of this community. Uli is greatly recognized by the achievements of Igwe Okolie Akwara whose reign faced numerous criticisms ranging from seizing landed properties, numerous wives and acquisition of power. Though any of this accusations are still to be proven, it can be clearly recorded that the heir of the late Igwe Okolie Akwara, Daniel Okolie, rejected the crown and throne for Christianity as he was part of the soldiers taken during the WW II to fight in Europe. He was exposed and sought Christianity and he is credited to have single-handedly created the road that leads from the current Uli Centre expressway into Umuoma down to Osemoto river so his people could worship with the Roman Catholic Church at Centre.

On Genius, members of the public submit a range of unusual ideas and inventions for Gorman and guest celebrity judges to decide whether the idea is \\"Genius\\". The first series began airing on 20 March 2009, following the success of an unbroadcast pilot. A second series started filming in May 2010, with quite a few changes to the format. Six episodes were recorded and began broadcasting on 27 September 2010. Genius was axed after the 2nd series by the BBC. When asked on Twitter if it was coming back Dave Gorman said, \\"Afraid not\\". There are currently no plans to bring the show back. Format Genius involves various members of the public suggesting their ideas for strange and unusual inventions and schemes. The ideas are sent to the Genius website, www.bbc.co.uk/genius, and also sent to their email address, genius@bbc.co.uk. Ideas include fitting a second hood to coats in order to protect dates from the rain, comb-unders for men who cannot grow beards, and increasing tourism to the Isle of Wight by making it symmetrical. The format was changed significantly between the two series Series One The potential \\"genius\\" delivers their idea from a podium while Gorman and his guest talk about the merits of the plan, performing some experiments concerning the idea. The celebrity judge then decides whether the idea is \\"Genius or not\\", which is done by pressing one of two buttons. If the player is declared a genius, the judge pushes the white button and the stage revolves clockwise, where the player enters a white door and is declared \\"Genius\\". If the player is not a genius, the judge pressed the red button and the stage revolves anticlockwise, where the player enters a red door and is declared \\"Not a genius\\". When all of the ideas have been heard, the judge is then given 10 seconds to decide which of the genius ideas is the most genius. The creator of the winning idea is awarded with the Genius Trophy. In the middle of the show, Gorman and the judge also read out a selection of rejected ideas, to give an idea of the kind of ideas Genius receives. Series Two Series two changed the format such that a greater number of ideas could be considered within the programme. For each episode, a number of potential \\"geniuses\\" sit in the front rows of the studio audience and during the course of the show a number are called upon by Gorman and two or three celebrity guests to share their ideas. Whilst ideas are declared \\"genius\\" or \\"not genius\\" by the panel, there are no \\"winners\\" or trophy as in season one. Production The television version of Genius is an adaptation of the original radio version created by Ali Crockatt and David Scott, and produced by Simon Nicholls. The season one set was designed with a rotating stage on which the contestants enter and leave the studio - a reference to the game show Blankety Blank. Reception Genius received mixed reviews when it was first broadcast. Sam Wollaston for The Guardian wrote that, \\"it just about gets away with it - I'm going to give it another go, anyway. And that's because some of these guys' (they are all blokes, and probably always will be) ideas are actually pretty funny.\\" Anna Lowman from TV Scoop also commented on the show saying: \\"This isn't groundbreaking TV - if anything it felt slightly '90s in its Room 101-ness - and the unnecessarily huge studio gave a strange atmosphere to proceedings at times. But it is a big-hearted, fun celebration of oddness which is no bad thing. And I've a feeling that the bit where they read 'rejected' ideas might become a highlight of each episode.\\" Aidan Smith from Scotland on Sunday was more critical. He wrote that: \\"The show may have had charm on radio but now it's transferred to the box with Dave Gorman hosting, you can obviously see the would-be genii and they just look mad. Madder still, though, is the set designer who went to the trouble of creating the revolving stage complete with dry ice - and in the first edition, a model of a 100m running track to illustrate how lazy people would line up in running shoes 98.2 metres high and forward-flop over the finish line. Give me Sunday night telly over Friday post-pub bilge like this.\\" Caitlin Moran from The Times was one of the most damning. She described the show as: \\"like a light entertainment Wounded Knee, but with a studio audience\\", and she also compared it negatively to another comedy that had begun earlier in the week, Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, saying: \\"The BBC amazes me. It takes four years for Stewart Lee - a comedian with 17 years' experience - to get a six-part series; yet in Genius wholly inexperienced members of the public are expected to deliver five minutes of broadcast-quality improvised material at the drop of a hat. What, literally, is that all about?\\" When the first episode was broadcast, it was watched by 1.67 million viewers, or 8.9% of the total viewing audience.

A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11, 2014. A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10, 2016 with a Western release on May 17, 2016. The game was released digitally for the Nintendo Switch on September 27, 2018 in Japan and October 16, 2018 in North America and Europe. The later versions include previously released downloadable content. The game is set in Europa, a fictional region loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game's visuals, which use Sega's CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawings in motion. Valkyria Chronicles earned numerous awards from several notable video game publications. The success of the game spawned a media franchise, including several manga titles and an anime series. Two sequels were released for PlayStation Portable: Valkyria Chronicles II in 2010, and Valkyria Chronicles III in 2011. A spin-off, Valkyria Revolution, was released on January 19, 2017, for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox One. The fourth entry, Valkyria Chronicles 4 was released in 2018 for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Gameplay The overhead map view of Command Mode. Colored lines indicate enemies' current level of awareness toward the unit selected by the player Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game in which the player uses a unique turn-based battle system called BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones). During their turn the player views an overhead map in Command Mode, but zooms in to control each individual unit on the battlefield in Action Mode. Movement and other actions are handled in real time during Action Mode, though limited in movement by an action point (AP) gauge that varies for each type of character. During Target Mode, the player is in direct control of characters' aim while the action freezes, allowing for head shots and other maneuvers. Taking command of individual units during the player's phase costs Command Points, which can be used dynamically to grant movement to many different units or the same unit consecutively with diminishing AP reserve, depending on what the player wants to accomplish. By using their troops the player must fulfill various conditions depending on the mission in order to achieve victory, most often the capture of a major enemy encampment. Upon completing missions, the player is awarded money and experience with which to upgrade their materiel and character classes, respectively, and the game's story is advanced. Missions can be failed if the player's forces are wholly incapacitated or killed, the squad's main battle tank is destroyed, or the player's main base camp is captured by the enemy. Homer Peron attacks Imperial troops with a hand grenade in Action Mode. Onomatopoeia is often used to reinforce the game's visual style. Each character in the game fulfills a specific role — for instance, Alicia is a mid-range rifle-toting scout, while Welkin is a tank commander. Other roles include Shocktroopers (assault infantry), \\"Lancers\\" specializing in anti-tank warfare, snipers, and engineers. These various units form a rock-paper- scissors dynamic of strength and weakness. The foot soldiers (Scout, Shocktrooper, and Sniper) are effective against slower anti-tank units, anti- tank units can quickly destroy tanks with a well-aimed shot, and tanks are generally devastating against infantry, whose anti-personnel weapons are unable to inflict any significant frontal damage. While each character within a class is basically similar in terms of weaponry and statistics, each individual has a distinguishing set of Potentials: special abilities or stat modifiers triggered by various psychological or environmental factors in battle. The environment also factors heavily in combat. In an urban level, for example, snipers can be sent onto rooftops to eliminate unsuspecting enemies below. Tanks can knock down walls and other obstacles to open new paths. Buildings and other structures offer hard cover around which to maneuver. Foliage offers soft cover to reduce the chance of being spotted by the enemy and to confound their aim when seen. As the Gallian forces advance across the battlefield, control points can be captured, giving the player a tactical advantage and offering additional locations in which to call reinforcements. As Welkin, the player can issue various Orders for the purpose of things such as artillery strikes, supervising medics, and improving offensive or defensive capabilities of various characters. Plot In 1935 E.C., the continent of Europa is dominated by two superpowers: The Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance in the east and a commonwealth of loosely allied democracies known as the Atlantic Federation in the west. The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia to seize its rich Ragnite deposits. When Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of the country's hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to the capital city of Randgriz and join the Gallian militia. Welkin is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and assumes command of the newly formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non- commissioned officer. Members of the squad initially question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience. He quickly gains their trust and loyalty, however, with his brilliant tactics. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged, but tragically, Isara is killed by an Imperial sniper. After Squad 7 wages a successful campaign against Imperial forces, the crown prince Maximilian deploys one of his commanders, Selvaria Bles, a rare descendant of the Valkyrians who are believed to have saved the ancient world from the Darcsen race. Using innate magic powers and equipped with a legendary Ragnite lance and shield, Selvaria destroys the Gallian army. Alicia is shot by Welkin's archaeologist colleague Faldio Landzaat to awaken her own latent Valkyrian powers. Alicia is able to drive Selvaria back, allowing the Gallians to advance to the border. At the cost of her own life, Selvaria uses the \\"final flame\\" after the capture of the Ghirlandaio fortress, killing the entire core of Gallian military and leaving only the militia, such as Squad 7, remaining. In an attempt to create his own empire, Maximilian uses a \\"land dreadnought\\", the Marmota, to break through Gallia's defenses and steal a giant Valkyrian lance from inside Randgriz Castle. The princess reveals herself to be Darcsen - the Valkyrians rewrote history to make themselves into heroes, while an allied Darcsen tribe gained Randgriz as the spoils. With Alicia's help, Squad 7 is able to board the Marmota and send Maximilian to his demise, destroying the dreadnought and ending the conflict between the two factions. Alicia and Welkin return to Bruhl, where they marry and raise a daughter named Isara together. Development The earliest concept for Valkyria Chronicles was created in 2003, during discussions between director Shuntaro Tanaka and producer Ryutaro Nonaka. The two were part of neighbouring teams working on different games; Nonaka was leading production on Nightshade, while Tanaka was completing the GameCube port of Skies of Arcadia. The two wanted to work on something new, with Tanaka suggesting a game based around a dramatic war story. Both had worked on the Sakura Wars series, but knew they would face restrictions if they created something within that series, so they created a new concept. Nonaka and Tanaka later said the many similarities to Sakura Wars were mainly because of shared development teams and gameplay styles rather than conscious choices. A key aspect of the project was to go against market trends, which were focusing on specific genre archetypes that did not allow for much creativity on the team's part. The initial pitch was titled \\"Gallian Panzers\\". The pitch artwork was created by Daisuke Tabayashi, who would stay as part of the game's art and modelling team. After the concept was approved, the team made a movie pitch using its new official title. During its early concept stages, no platform had been decided; Nonaka vaguely thought the game would be produced for the PlayStation 2, for which the team had been principally developing. He also considered developing the game for the PlayStation Portable. When the PS3 was revealed and internal discussions began about its use by the company, Nonaka suggested that Valkyria Chronicles could be produced for the platform. The production team was based in Sega's GE2 R&D; division. The staff had worked on a wide variety of titles for Sega, including Sakura Wars and Skies of Arcadia. Production for the PS3 was both liberating thanks to the increased hardware specifications, and challenging due to working out how to best use the console's CPU. Its final Japanese title represented the focus on war, with the term \\"Valkyria\\" symbolising its fantasy elements. In its earliest form, the gameplay was a traditional tactical simulation game played from an overhead view. After considering this, Nonaka—comparing it to a game of shogi—realised players would feel little emotional investment in characters if they continued with this gameplay style. Much of the early development was devoted to creating a working system that would combine tactical elements with real-time action. The concept of the BLiTZ battle system was to encourage player freedom. When creating the battle system around firearms rather than swords and magic, the team needed to abandon many of the logical RPG standards. The team chose to have players control individual units to further emphasise the game's themes. The AP system was designed around the concept of emulating the fear of soldiers in combat, afraid to take a step in case of hidden enemies or making a fatal move. The class-based leveling was a response to the large number of playable characters. If they went with traditional character-based leveling, the team knew players would likely stick to a few favorites. This leveling system also played into the permadeath systems and the focus on turn numbers determining how players did on a map rather than unit survival. The emphasis was getting the players emotionally invested by picking party members based on personality, making their loss in battle more noticeable. A sixth character class, the Medic, was originally planned. The only remnant of its inclusion was the rescue mechanic for downed units. Nonaka attributed his ability to handle the dual-natured gameplay from his work on both the tactics-based Sakura Wars and the action game Nightshade. Design The world's period setting—based on Europe during the period before and during World War II during 1930s to 1940s was in place from the beginning of development. The aim was to blend this setting with medieval elements, with the rest of the world view and design springing from that point. Many levels included direct homages to events from World War II, including forest battles, an amphibious landing, and a fort line similar to the Maginot Line. The country of Gallia drew inspiration from smaller countries of that time like Belgium and the Netherlands, which were often caught between larger powers. The team considered using Switzerland as inspiration, but its mountainous terrain made tank combat impracticable, so the team principally used the Netherlands as inspiration for Gallia's geography. Its name and aspects of its story were inspired by Gaul. The Empire and Federation were respectively based on Germany and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The game's idyllic scenery was influenced by the team's desire to incorporate fantasy, as a purely urban setting might reduce the opportunity for fantastic elements. Tanaka wrote the main narrative and scenarios for the characters, assisted by a dedicated writing team. While the leads Welkin and Alicia and much of the key supporting cast were present from the earliest stages, several had different artistic designs and several concept scenes and more fantastical elements such as floating islands were dropped from the final game. Welkin's name and parts of his storyline were derived from Gaulish chieftain Vercingetorix who united Gaul against the Romans. To give the story a more personal feeling and draw from Japanese military history, the characters were made militiamen without extensive military training, creating a deliberate contrast to the hardened career soldier protagonists from the movie Saving Private Ryan and the series Combat!. The history between the Darcsan and Valkyria groups was written as a tragic tale, with people accepting as fact a history written by victorious powers. The team were directly inspired by the ethnic conflicts fuelling World War II, and the long histories behind them. The Valkyria formed an allegory for weapons of mass destruction in real-life conflicts. The lead characters were designed by Raita Honjou. Honjou was selected after the team saw his art, as they felt he could portray both the realistic and fantastic elements of the game's world. The overall visual design was influenced by the long-running anime series World Masterpiece Theater. As part of their research on the graphical style, the team researched both realistic and comic-based art styles. The uniforms were based around a variety of real-life uniforms, with both practical elements and individual quirks that would not be allowed in real-life such as Rosie's hairstyle. Originally directly inspired by World War II uniforms, they looked too futuristic for the setting. The team instead drew inspiration from earlier uniform designs, which were more specific to different countries. They also made an effort to keep American uniform influences out of the designs. For the large majority of minor and supporting characters, other artists were in charge. The team originally planned 100 side characters, but this proved practically impossible, so the number was cut to 50. The Imperial tank designs were based on those from the Russian military. To ease unit identification for players, the Gallian and Imperial forces were respectively colored blue and red. The game's early internal promotional videos focused on the art style over gameplay, as the team knew if they simply described its genre it would give the wrong impression to executives. Valkyria Chronicles made use of a proprietary game engine dubbed CANVAS, which produced stylised graphics modelled on watercolor paintings. Nonaka wanted to blend traditional animation style with CGI elements, something he had previously experienced with the \\"Neo-CGI\\" used in Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?. CANVAS came about from experiments within another of Sega's R&D; department with next-generation engine technology. Its graphical style, which allowed for the emulation of hand-drawn artwork, was picked by staff once the game was moved to the PS3. A key figure in the engine's development for Valkyria Chronicles was Hirotaka Kanazawa. Kanazawa helped with the early map designs. During early development, the team struggled to make their vision work with the CANVAS prototype. The graphics still had a strong CGI aesthetic, with crisp graphics and a strong draw distance. These did not fit with Nonaka's vision for the game, which was a non-photorealistic presentation described as a natural evolution from the styles of Sakura Wars and Skies of Arcadia. With this concept in mind, Kanazawa and Tabayashi redesigned the engine to show these graphics. One of the elements the team focused on was shadows effects, with environments and characters requiring two different shadow types with differing strengths. Using the CANVAS engine was a challenge for the designers and programmers due to its heavy hardware demands, with the team's PC development needed two stacked graphics cards to run the software without crashing. Music Hitoshi Sakimoto composed the soundtrack for Valkyria Chronicles, being attached to the project from its inception. The music was handled by Hitoshi Sakimoto, a composer noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series and other projects through his company Basiscape. Sakimoto was brought on board the project during its pre-production stage, though most of his compositional work during 2007. He was brought in by Nonaka, who contacted him about Valkyria Chronicles when it still had a small team and had not entered full production. Sakimoto assumed it would be a small-scale game for a portable console, so its development for PS3 came as a shock to him. Valkyria Chronicles was the first PS3 project Basiscape worked on. The battle scores were the most difficult to create due to the need for scale. Several tracks made use of a full live orchestra. These tracks were performed by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra founded in Australia. When told about the game, Sakimoto received the impression of militarism, which was reflected throughout the score. Originally treating as a musical investigation of war, Sakimoto's discussions with the staff began steering the score towards portraying the romance between Welkin and Alicia. Ultimately, the music's military elements became supporting parts for the romantic themes. The main theme was created by Sakimoto during pre-production, as one of three pieces based on the demo movie; the other pieces included the opening battle theme \\"Desperate Battle\\" and the story theme \\"Empty Loneliness\\". Sakimoto created three different arrangements for the team to choose from, with the current one being picked due to its thematic qualities. The main theme recurs as a leitmotif in multiple tracks. A dominant instrument used by Sakimoto was taiko drums, using a wide variety of them to create different sounds and emulate the sound of a marching band. Two themes were created by Sakimoto for Selvaria; the first theme \\"A Valkyria Awakened\\" had Sakimoto making use of traditional classical music and nonsensical chorus work to emulate the group's mythical status, and an arranged version called \\"Signs of the Valkyria\\" which would communicate Selvaria's tragic past. Military base themes made heavy use of brass instruments, and the character theme for the Darcsans was modelled in Israeli music. A key vocal theme is \\"A Love Passed On\\". Sakimoto created the track as a \\"Gallian traditional song\\". He planned to write a short version without a full orchestra, but after learning the original song would not be used extensively, he focused on the orchestral version. The melody of \\"A Love Passed On\\" was used in the track \\"The Legacy\\", which played during the epilogue cutscenes. A version for solo piano was written for that final scene, but it was dropped and only included on the soundtrack's album release. The Japanese version was written by Taihei Sato, and sung by Rosie's voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. According to Sakimoto, the song moved her so much that she cried after finishing recording. The English version was performed by Hedy Burress. The game's opening and ending song, \\"No Matter How Far...\\" was performed by Japanese singer Juju. It was the only song with which Sakimoto had no involvement. Juju was suggested to the team by Sega's marketing division. After hearing some of her published work, the team pushed to have her work on the game. Her producer offered a song that had yet to be released, which the team accepted. They collaborated with Juju to rework the song so its tone and lyrics fitted the world of Valkyria Chronicles. Release On September 29, 2008, Sega of America held a Valkyria Chronicles pre-launch event at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco. Press and public were invited, and Sega used a raffle to give away soundtracks, figurines of the characters, matted art posters signed by Nonaka, and an 80 GB PlayStation 3. Sega let the community send in questions before the event, and posted these to Nonaka in an interview during the event. Pictures and a follow-up of the event were posted on the Sega of America Blog. Supplemental downloadable content (DLC) was made available for purchase via PlayStation Network. First is the inclusion of a Hard EX Mode, extra challenging versions of existing skirmish missions where the Edelweiss is unavailable. Two side story chapters, \\"Edy's Mission: Enter the Edy Detachment\\" and \\"Selvaria's Mission: Behind Her Blue Flame\\", introduce Squad 7's motliest crew led by Edy Nelson and Homer Pieron, and the early portion of the invasion into Gallia as seen from the Imperial perspective. Hard EX Mode and Edy's Mission were originally released for the Japanese version on August 8, 2008, while Selvaria's Mission was released on October 31 of the same year. All three were made available in North America on April 16, 2009. A fourth DLC, titled \\"Edy Detachment's Formal Challenge!\\" was made available in Japan on June 26, 2009, and in North America on February 25, 2010. Included are a set of six challenge missions, each focusing on one of the game's unit classes. Valkyria Chronicles was re-released in Japanese retails stores under its The Best label on March 5, 2009 with a retail price of ¥3,900. This version of the game includes Edy's Mission without need of download. Valkyria Chronicles was ported to Windows and released on Steam on November 11, 2014. This version of the game includes all downloadable content. The PC release features performance improvements, including the ability to play the game at 60 frames per second and on resolutions greater than 1080p, in addition to customised control mapping. A remastered version, titled Valkyria Chronicles Remastered, was announced by Sega and released on May 17, 2016 for PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe. The remastered console version runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second and includes both Japanese and English audio as well as all downloadable content. Outlet Crash Landed praised the remastered versions visuals and still stellar gameplay in their review, but criticized the lack of PlayStation 4 functionality implemented. This version was released digitally for the Nintendo Switch on September 27, 2018 in Japan and October 16, 2018 in North America and Europe. Reception Valkyria Chronicles has received very favorable reviews from numerous sources, including writers for IGN, RPGFan, G4TV's X-Play, and GameTrailers. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was impressed with the title's gameplay design, noting that it gave players a new sense of tactical freedom absent in other games of the same genre via the removal of certain staples such as a grid-based map. Some reviewers enjoyed the active and strategic nature of combat. According to Game Revolution's Chris Hudak, \\"nail-gnawingly tense\\" situations kept the player emotionally involved in the game. Both the game's story and the way in which it was presented were cited as strong points. Longevity was also attributed to the game, with James Quentin Clark of RPGFan noting that, \\"the game gets better the more you play it.\\" While pleased overall, multiple reviewers criticized the artificial intelligence of enemy forces. Others stated that the third-person camera interfered with the ability to shoot effectively in certain situations. Sales Despite receiving positive press, sales of the game have been mixed. While it sold 77,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan and a further 81,000 during its budget release,http://gamasutra.com/view/news/109410/Mario_Kart_Tops_Japanese_Charts_For_Third_Week.phphttp://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1230928_1124.html the game only sold 33,000 copies in the United States during November 2008.http://kotaku.com/5110889/littlebigplanet-valkyria-chronicles-sales- disappoint The game failed to reach the top 100 sold software in the month of November; it was the 93rd best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 141,589 copies. Despite weak initial North American sales, Valkyria Chronicles recovered with sales sharply increasing in April 2009 following a price cut and the simultaneous release of an anime based on the game. Approximately a year after the game's initial release, both producer Ryutaro Nonaka and gamers surveyed by Famitsu stated interest in a sequel to the game. As of 2015, the PS3 version has shipped 1million units worldwide. The 2014 PC version of the game exceeded its publisher's expectations, topping the Steam sales charts on the day of its release, ahead of the then also recently launched games Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Assassin's Creed Unity. It also received favorable reviews, with a Metacritic score of 85. By April 2017, the PC version of the game had sold about 925,000 copies on Steam. As of April 2018, the Steam version has sold 953,838 copies. The remastered PS4 version has sold 39,071 copies in Japan as of December 2016. In total, the game sold copies across all platforms.

It is also the name of an electoral ward comprising a wider area of four surrounding communities. Maenclochog Community includes the small settlement of Llanycefn () and the village of Rosebush. The Maenclochog community population was 731 in 2011. Maenclochog lies south of the Preseli Hills, about one mile southeast of Rosebush on the B4313 Narberth to Fishguard road. Origin of the name The origin of the name Maenclochog is unclear. It appears to be made up of two Welsh words, maen (\\"stone\\") and clochog (\\"noisy, clamorous\\").Y Geiriadur Mawr, Gwasg GomerGeiriadur Prifysgol Cymru A local tale reports that there were stones near Ffynnon Fair (\\"Mary's Well\\"), to the south of the village, which rang like bells when struck, but these were blown up by treasure-hunters, in the mistaken belief that they concealed a golden treasure. This may represent nothing more than folk etymology. An alternative proposal is that the second part of the name comes from the Irish word, clochog, meaning a craggy place. This theory is supported by the fact that there was Irish migration to Pembrokeshire in the early Middle Ages, as attested to by the 5th or 6th century Ogham stones found in the locality and elsewhere, and certainly the name suits the topography of the area.Naws am Le/Sense of Place: PLANED leaflet 2010 History Maenchlochog Standing Stones Maenclochog fair in 1893 There is evidence of prehistoric occupation in the vicinity of the present village. Researchers have found what are believed to be the remains of a 13th-century castle at Maenclochog. Maenclochog (as Mancloghay) appears on a 1583 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The village was served by the Maenclochog Railway, formally known as the Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway, which ran from Clynderwyn on the Great Western Railway via Maenclochog to Rosebush. The tunnel just outside Maenclochog was used during World War 2 as a bomb-test site for Barnes Wallis, creator of the bouncing bomb. Following the Second World War an attempt by the War Office to take over 16,000 acres of the Preselau slopes, as a permanent military training ground, was thwarted by a strong campaign led by local ministers of religion and headteachers. The acquisition would have meant a loss of farming livelihood, and Maenclochog might have become a garrison village.(editions in Welsh and English) Community St Mary's Church and graveyard The village has a local committee to discuss village affairs. There are two general stores and two petrol stations with an MOT service. In the centre of the village is St Mary's church (Welsh: Eglwys Fair), the park and the green on a small road island.

History The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, traveled along the coast on its way north, camping for three days near today's San Gregorio, October 24–26, 1769. On the return journey to San Diego, the party camped near Half Moon Bay on November 16, and at Tunitas Creek on November 17. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \\"This morning broke very cloudy, and as soon as we started on our way it began to rain, and in the whole three leagues (about ) that we traveled it was falling on us. We halted on the banks of a deep arroyo.\\" The name \\"Arroyo de Las Tunitas\\" appears on the diseños (claim maps) of both Rancho San Gregorio (1839) and Rancho Cañada Verde (1838) because it was part of the boundary between them. The cliffs just north of the Tunitas Creek outflow were the site of \\"Gordon's Chute\\", a ramp for sliding farm goods from the top of the cliffs to ships anchored in the rolling surf below. Gordon's Chute, named for its builder, local resident Alexander Gordon, was constructed in 1872 and lasted until 1885, when a storm blew it away.Gordon's Chute Eyebolts for the chute can still be found in the cliff-face.

He became Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Early career Kelynge was the only son of John Kelyng of Hertford and his wife Alice Waterhouse, daughter of Gregory Waterhouse of Halifax, Yorkshire. He was baptised on 19 July 1607. History of Parliament Online - Kelyng, John He matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge at Easter 1623 and was admitted into the Inner Temple on 22 January 1624. He was called to the bar on 10 February 1632, and from this time to the Restoration, no mention is made of him in the reports. Lord Clarendon describes him to the king as \\"a person of eminent learning, eminent suffering, never wore his gown after the rebellion, but was always in gaol;\\" and he himself, on his being made a judge in 1663, speaks of his \\"twenty years' silence.\\" Serjeant-at-law With such claims it is not surprising that he was included in the first batch of new Serjeants called by Charles II on 4 July 1660, to take the degree at the following Michaelmas; and was immediately engaged on the part of the crown to advise with the judges relative to the proceedings to be adopted against the regicides. He is named as counsel on the trials of Colonel Hacker and William Heveningham; and in the next year in that of John James a fifth-monarchy man. Returned as member for Bedford to the Parliament that met in May, 1661, he prepared the Act of Uniformity, passed in the next year. On 8 November, he was made king's Serjeant, and in that character was one of the counsel on the trial of Sir Harry Vane, towards whom his conduct was unfeelingly harsh and insulting. Judicial career The resignation of Mr. Justice Malet opening the way for his further advancement, he was appointed to fill the vacant seat in the King's Bench on 18 June 1663. He was present at the noted trial of the witches at Bury before Chief Baron Hale, in March 1662. He was appointed as Hale's coadjutor on the circuit. The dissatisfaction with the verdict which he is represented to have expressed seems to proceed, not from his disbelief in the existence of witchcraft, but from his opinion that the evidence was not sufficient to convict them. Within two years after his promotion the death of Sir Robert Hyde made a vacancy in the office of chief justice of the King's Bench. It remained unfilled for nearly seven months, when Kelynge, on 21 November 1665, was elevated to the post. He retained it during the remainder of his life, with little reputation as a lawyer, and frequently incurring censure by his want of temper and discretion. The Great Fire He played a prominent role in events after the Great Fire in 1666. He presided over the trial of an innocent but insane Frenchman, Robert Hubert, who confessed to setting the fire in the King's Bakehouse in Pudding Lane. Hubert was duly found guilty by the jury and executed by order of Kelynge, even though Kelynge told the King that he did not believe a word of the confession. Kelynge later led a commission to examine numerous other witnesses and concluded that the fire was started by accident and was so calamitous because of a number of circumstances, including the very strong easterly wind. He was also appointed one of the \\"Fire Judges\\" to resolve disputes arising from the destruction caused by the Great Fire. He was among the 22 Fire Judges whose portraits were painted by Wright and which hung for centuries in London's Guildhall. The cutdown, but otherwise well preserved, remnant of the portrait now belongs to the Inner Temple, of which he was a member.\\"The Great Fire of London\\" Walter G. Bell; The Bodley Head Controversies In 1664, at the Cambridge Assizes, while puisne judge, he had bound over Mr. Roger Pepys, known to readers of the Diary of Samuel Pepys as \\"Cousin Roger\\", to his good behaviour for speaking slightly of Chief Justice Hyde at a town sessions. In 1667 numerous complaints and impeachment recommendations were made against him in parliament by the opposition, the \\"gentlemen of the county\\" for divers \\"high proceedings\\" in the execution of his office, such as fining of juries for bringing in verdicts contrary to the evidence, and for referring to Magna Carta as \\"Magna Farta\\" (this seems to have been a common gibe, even among judges, at the time); for which he was obliged to answer before the House of Commons. That body voted his proceedings to be illegal and tending to the introduction of arbitrary government, and at first seemed inclined to proceed with great severity, ordering that he should be brought to trial: but in the end, by the mediation of his friends, the matter was allowed to drop. Again in 1670 he was obliged to apologise publicly in the House of Lords for rudely affronting Lord Holles on a trial in the court of King's Bench. Sir Thomas Raymond however, in recording his death, calls him \\"a learned, faithful, and resolute judge.\\" He collected various crown cases in which he was the judge, which were published after his death by Chief Justice Holt. Death and posterity He died at his house in Hatton Garden on 9 May 1671, leaving a son who was named in 1660 as one of the intended knights of the Royal Oak, and who afterwards was knighted and became king's Serjeant. The family name of the mother of that son has not been found, but the register of St. Andrew's, Holborn, records her burial under her Christian name Mary on 26 September 1667; and the judge's marriage with Mrs. Elizabeth Bassett, on 23 March 1667/8. In 1684 one of his grandsons was living at Southill, Bedfordshire. Whether the William Kelynge who reported cases in the reign of George II was of the judge's family does not appear.

The band was composed of about 1,500 men, women, and children from the Sauk, Meskwaki, Fox, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, and Ottawa nations; about 500 of that number were warriors. Black Hawk had an alliance with the British that dated from the War of 1812, giving them their colloquial name. The band crossed the Mississippi River from Iowa into Illinois in an attempt to reclaim their homeland and in violation of several treaties. Subsequently, both the Illinois and Michigan Territory militia were called up and the Black Hawk War ensued. The British Band was victorious at the Battle of Stillman's Run and the military engagements that followed were insignificant until the final two encounters: the Wisconsin Heights and the Bad Axe River. Band members who survived the war were either imprisoned or returned home. All the prisoners taken following the conflict were released by Winfield Scott at the end of August 1832, except Black Hawk who was taken east. In 1833 he dictated his autobiography, the first Native American autobiography published in the United States. Background Sauk warrior Black Hawk, the leader of a band of Sauks near Rock Island at Saukenuk, was a chief voice of opposition to the ceding of Native American lands to American settlers and the U.S. government. Black Hawk supported the invalidity of the Treaty of St. Louis of both the Sauk and Fox nations negotiated with the then Indiana Territory Governor William Henry Harrison. The treaty ceded territory, including Black Hawk's birthplace Saukenuk, to the United States. The Sauk traditionally had been a society that reached their decision-making via consensus. Their representatives exceeded the authorization of merely taking under consideration what terms the United States government might put forth, bring them back to reach a consensus and then return with their treaty terms. The lack of the tribe discussing the treaty prior to being made official made it invalid by Black Hawk and other members of the tribe. The representatives never had the tribal authorization to unilaterally cede its lands. During the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom and the United States, Robert Dickson, an English fur trader, amassed a sizable force of Native Americans at Green Bay to assist the British in operations around the Great Lakes. Most of the warriors Dickson assembled were from the Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, Kickapoo and Ottawa tribes. Dickson conferred the rank of brevet Brigadier General on Black Hawk.Smith, William Rudolph.

He was given command of all Native Americans gathered at Green Bay, including the 200 Sauk warriors under Black Hawk's control. Black Hawk was then presented with a silk flag, a medal, and a written certificate of good behavior and alliance with the British. The certificate would be found 20 years later, after the Battle of Bad Axe, carefully preserved along with a flag similar to the one Dickson gave to Black Hawk. During the 1812 war, Black Hawk and his warriors fought in several engagements with Henry Procter on the borders of Lake Erie. He returned home to Saukenuk to find his rival Keokuk had become the tribe's war chief. After the war ended, Black Hawk signed a peace treaty in May 1816 that re-affirmed the treaty of 1804, a provision Black Hawk later protested ignorance of.Lewis, James. \\"Background ,\\" The Black Hawk War of 1832, Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, Northern Illinois University. Retrieved 20 September 2007. Prelude to war Despite opposition by Keokuk and the US authorities, Black Hawk's band returned to Saukenuk in 1830 following their winter hunt. A year later they returned again, and Illinois Governor John Reynolds proclaimed it an \\"invasion of the state.\\" Responding to Illinois Governor John Reynolds' call, General Edmund Pendleton Gaines brought his federal troops from St. Louis, Missouri to Saukenuk to insist on Black Hawk's immediate departure. Black Hawk left but soon returned to the west side of the Mississippi, threatened by Gaines' troops and an additional 1,400 militia called up by Reynolds on 25 June 1831. On 30 June, Black Hawk and the chiefs of the British Band were forced to sign a surrender agreement in which they promised to remain west of the Mississippi. At the end of 1831, stories spread throughout the settlements of the Upper Mississippi River Valley that the British planned to aid Black Hawk in the event of a war with American settlers. According to U.S. Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain, a known ne'er-do-well named Billy Caldwell had delivered a message to the Sauk which reported the alleged British intentions. The New Galenian of Galena reported that Black Hawk's band would receive aid and ammunition from the British, and the tale was widely believed. The militia commander at Fort Armstrong, Major John Bliss, informed General Henry Atkinson of the rumor, and said a follower of Keokuk had reported to him that Black Hawk and Neapope were holding talks with bands of Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Ho-Chunk. The talks mentioned the promises of the British, as well as word that the French Canadians intended to assist them.Trask, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Hear of America, pp.139–140.

When Black Hawk's Band crossed the Mississippi River from Iowa in April 1832 to return to their homeland in the Rock River Valley, it was under a British flag. Potawatomi Chief Shabbona stated it was the same flag that had been given on a visit to the British in Malden, Ontario, Canada. Observers at the time, from George Davenport, to St. Vrain, were certain that Black Hawk's intentions were to wage war against the United States.Trask, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, pp. 152–156. Historians generally believe that a more decisive action by General Atkinson, charged with prosecuting the war, in stopping Black Hawk's Band from moving up the Rock River may have prevented the war. Zachary Taylor made similar observations shortly after the war ended. Horseshoe Bend, shown here in an 1857 painting.

Besides the major victory at Stillman's Run Black Hawk's Band was involved in several other battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War. Several of the small skirmishes and massacres that occurred following Stillman's Run were attributed to bands of Native Americans unaffiliated with Black Hawk's Band, though many were likely sympathetic or intent on joining him. The events at Spafford Farm were attributed to a band of Kickapoo loosely affiliated with the British Band. After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was informed that Henry Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton.

Many Sauk and Fox found return to their homes more difficult, and while some returned safely others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to Fort Armstrong.

As such a magic hyperbeam generalises the two dimensional magic rectangle and the three dimensional magic beam, a series that mimics the series magic square, magic cube and magic hypercube. This article will mimic the magic hypercubes article in close detail, and just as that article serves merely as an introduction to the topic. Conventions It is customary to denote the dimension with the letter 'n' and the orders of a hyperbeam with the letter 'm' (appended with the subscripted number of the direction it applies to). * (n) Dimension : the amount of directions within a hyperbeam. * (mk) Order : the amount of numbers along kth monagonal k = 0, ..., n − 1\\\\. Further: In this article the analytical number range [0..k=0∏n-1mk-1] is being used. Notations in order to keep things in hand a special notation was developed: * [ ki; k=[0..n-1]; i=[0..mk-1] ]: positions within the hyperbeam * < ki; k=[0..n-1]; i=[0..mk-1] >: vectors through the hyperbeam Note: The notation for position can also be used for the value on that position. There where it is appropriate dimension and orders can be added to it thus forming: n[ki]m0,..,mn-1 Construction=Basic Description of more general methods might be put here, I don't often create hyperbeams, so I don't know whether Knightjump or Latin Prescription work here. Other more adhoc methods suffice on occasion I need a hyperbeam. Multiplication Amongst the various ways of compounding, the multiplicationthis is a hyperbeam version of (pe.): Alan Adler magic square multiplication can be considered as the most basic of these methods. The basic multiplication is given by: nB(m..)1 * nB(m..)2 : n[ki](m..)1(m..)2 = n[ ki \\\\ mk2(m..)1k=0∏n-1mk1](m..)2 \\\\+ [ki % mk2](m..)2](m..)1(m..)2 (m..) abbreviates: m0,..,mn-1. (m..)1(m..)2 abbreviates: m01m02,..,mn-11mn-12. Curiosities=all orders are either even or odd A fact that can be easily seen since the magic sums are: Sk = mk (j=0∏n-1mj \\\\- 1) / 2 When any of the orders mk is even, the product is even and thus the only way Sk turns out integer is when all mk are even. Thus suffices: all mk are either even or odd. This is with the exception of mk=1 of course, which allows for general identities like: * Nmt = Nm,1 * N1,m * Nm = N1,m * Nm,1 Which goes beyond the scope of this introductory article Only one direction with order = 2 since any number has but one complement only one of the directions can have mk = 2. Aspects A hyperbeam knows 2n Aspectial variants, which are obtained by coördinate reflection ([ki] --> [k(-i)]) effectively giving the Aspectial variant: nB(m0..mn-1)~R ; R = k=0∑n-1 ((reflect(k)) ? 2k : 0) ; Where reflect(k) true iff coördinate k is being reflected, only then 2k is added to R. In case one views different orientations of the beam as equal one could view the number of aspects n! 2n just as with the magic hypercubes, directions with equal orders contribute factors depending on the hyperbeam's orders. This goes beyond the scope of this article. Basic manipulations Besides more specific manipulations, the following are of more general nature * ^[perm(0..n-1)] : coördinate permutation (n  2: transpose) * _2axis[perm(0..m-1)] : monagonal permutation (axis ε [0..n-1]) Note: '^' and '_' are essential part of the notation and used as manipulation selectors. Coördinate permutation The exchange of coördinaat [ki] into [perm(k)i], because of n coördinates a permutation over these n directions is required. The term transpose (usually denoted by t) is used with two dimensional matrices, in general though perhaps \\"coördinaatpermutation\\" might be preferable. Monagonal permutation Defined as the change of [ki] into [kperm(i)] alongside the given \\"axial\\"-direction. Equal permutation along various axes with equal orders can be combined by adding the factors 2axis. Thus defining all kinds of r-agonal permutations for any r. Easy to see that all possibilities are given by the corresponding permutation of m numbers. normal position In case no restrictions are considered on the n-agonals a magic hyperbeam can be represented shown in \\"normal position\\" by: [ki] < [k(i+1)] ; i = 0..mk-2 (by monagonal permutation) Qualification Qualifying the hyperbeam is less developed then it is on the magic hypercubes in fact only the k'th monagonal direction need to sum to: Sk = mk (j=0∏n-1mj \\\\- 1) / 2 for all k = 0..n-1 for the hyperbeam to be qualified {magic} When the orders are not relatively prime the n-agonal sum can be restricted to: S = lcm(mi ; i = 0..n-1) (j=0∏n-1mj \\\\- 1) / 2 with all orders relatively prime this reaches its maximum: Smax = j=0∏n-1mj (j=0∏n-1mj \\\\- 1) / 2 Special hyperbeams The following hyperbeams serve special purposes: The \\"normal hyperbeam\\" nNm0,..,mn-1 : [ki] = k=0∑n-1 ki mkk This hyperbeam can be seen as the source of all numbers. A procedure called \\"Dynamic numbering\\" makes use of the isomorphism of every hyperbeam with this normal, changing the source, changes the hyperbeam. Basic multiplications of normal hyperbeams play a special role with the \\"Dynamic numbering\\" of magic hypercubes of order k=0∏n-1 mk. The \\"constant 1\\" n1m0,..,mn-1 : [ki] = 1 The hyperbeam that is usually added to change the here used \\"analytic\\" numberrange into the \\"regular\\" numberrange. Other constant hyperbeams are of course multiples of this one. See also * Magic hypercubes  References Further reading * Thomas R.

Originally from Dundee, Scotland, he is noted for his involvement in high- profile cases, including Brian Mills, R. v. Trang, as defence attorney for Abdullah and Omar Khadr, who were captured in the War on Terror, for Fahim Ahmad, and for representing the entire Khadr family. He also represented Canadian Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy charged in the US with plotting to carry out mass shootings of civilians at concerts, to bomb New York Times Square, and to bomb the city's subway system. Edney was born in Dundee, Scotland, and worked as a building contractor, when he first immigrated to Canada. Edney received his law degree in 1987 from the University of Northumbria and has since appeared at all levels of court, including the Supreme Court of Canada and the United States Supreme Court. He was appointed as Foreign Attorney Consultant by the U.S. Pentagon to participate in the legal defence of Omar Khadr, at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. Career Edney has lectured extensively, with emphasis on the Rule of Law, to organizations, universities and conferences throughout North America. He served as keynote speaker on behalf of Amnesty International at Trinity College, Dublin, on the Rule of Law (2005); and in London, England, at the international conference on the \\"Global Struggle against Torture\\" (2005). On 25 September 2007 Edney appeared on the CBC Radio program As It Happens, where he claimed politics were responsible for the Crown's sudden reversal of process, abandoning the preliminary inquiry, for the Toronto terrorism trial. He was one of the defence attorneys supporting the publication ban on information about the trial, while others decried it.. In 2008 he received the Canadian National Pro Bono Award: \\"The significance of his commitment is based not only on the tremendous energy, time and personal resources spent advocating on Mr. Khadr’s behalf, but also based on the complexity of the litigation, which was argued before Canadian and U.S. courts and military tribunals. His commitment in the face of potential personal repercussions of representing an unpopular case is a testament to the finest traditions of the legal profession. The fruits of [his] labour have not only increased access to justice for one individual but impacted human rights the world over.\\" Dennis Edney in 2008 Edney was named by Alberta Venture magazine as one of 50 Alberta's most influential people for 2008. He received the 2009 Human Rights Medal awarded by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia for work that \\"has helped to promote and further human rights\\". In 2011, he was appointed as a Bencher of the Law Society of Alberta. He also received the honorary title of Queens Counsel for exceptional merit and contribution to the legal profession. On 10 December 2013, the 65th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he was recognized by the John Humphrey Centre for Peace and Human Rights in Edmonton. In addition to his caseload, he is noted for speaking publicly at conferences and engagements on legal matters, including the rule of law as it relates to the war on terror. On 19 September 2014, when the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, in Winnipeg, was first opened, Edney participated in a human rights panel about Omar Khadr's case at the nearby Manitoba Children’s Theatre. Edney was also presented with an award for his work from the Winnipeg Peace Alliance.

Its tributaries originate on the western ridges of the Santa Cruz Mountains whence it courses southwest through steep forested canyons. The San Gregorio Creek mainstem begins at the confluence of Alpine and La Honda Creeks, whence it flows through rolling grasslands and pasturelands until it meets the Pacific Ocean at San Gregorio State Beach. It traverses the small unincorporated communities of La Honda, San Gregorio, Redwood Terrace and Sky Londa. History San Gregorio Creek is historically significant as the campsite for Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolà's expedition from October 24–27, 1769, when he overshot his goal (Monterey Bay) and went on to Pacifica where he ascended Sweeney Ridge and discovered San Francisco Bay. The site is registered as California Historical Landmark 26. The creek was called Arroyo de San Gregorio in Spanish times and later, Arroyo Rodrigues in the 1850s. Watershed The San Gregorio watershed is located approximately south of Half Moon Bay and covers approximately . It is the second largest drainage in coastal San Mateo County, with approximately of \\"blue line\\" (perennial) streams. The mainstem of San Gregorio Creek begins at the confluence of Alpine Creek and La Honda Creek in La Honda, and flows to its mouth at San Gregorio State Beach in San Gregorio. The creek ends in a lagoon primarily in the incised channel upstream from the Highway 1 Bridge. The lagoon at its seasonal largest, is about and deep, and serves as habitat for tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi)) and rearing steelhead. Coho salmon do not rear in the lagoon but outgoing smolts use it to physiologically prepare for migration to saltwater. This river floods occasionally on its path down CA Route 84 towards the Pacific Ocean, most famously during the 1997 El Niño. Ecology The mainstem of San Gregorio Creek, in combination with its tributaries of La Honda, Alpine, Harrington, El Corte de Madera and Bogess Creeks, contains approximately of historical coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) rearing habitat. In the 1800s the creek had large enough salmon runs to support commercial harvest (Skinner, 1962). As part of the southern range of the Central California Coast Coho Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU), the creek is considered an attractive site for re-stocking. In fact, in 1998 the Draft Strategic Plan for Restoration of Endangered Coho Salmon South of San Francisco Bay identified San Gregorio Creek and its tributaries as one of nine creeks in which recovery of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) is a priority. South of San Francisco to Monterey Bay the coho salmon was listed by the State of California as endangered in 1995. The San Gregorio watershed has seen recently increasing residential development but remains primarily pastoral with cattle and sheep grazing, timber harvesting, and recreational trails being the main commercial uses. Because of the large private ownership and development potential, water diversions and low base flows are an important issue in this watershed. In 1993, water rights in the San Gregorio watershed were adjudicated and a minimum stream bypass flow was established. However, the prescribed bypass flows are too low to assure viable coho salmon populations. San Gregorio Creek is also part of the Central California Coast steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) ESU and historically supported a run of 1,000 fish as recently as 1971. In 2007, the San Gregorio Creek watershed was targeted by the California Department of Fish and Game for salmon recovery. In a 2008 survey, both coho salmon and steelhead were noted in the creek but threatened by Highway 84 related barriers to fish passage, as well as pressure from sedimentation from residential development, grazing and logging. The primary threat to salmonids in this report were bridge culverts at three sites which impede fish passage during low creek flows, and one site where a culvert from a small tributary is completely impassable in any season. Four special-status animal species - California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), coho salmon, steelhead, and tidewater goby are the focus of a June 2010 Watershed Management Plan. Western leatherwood (Dirca occidentalis), Santa Cruz manzanita (Arctostaphylos andersonii), and King’s Mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos regismontana), which are all included in the California Native Plant Society's Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California, have been documented in the La Honda Creek Open Space Preserve.

Archeosofica, 1969 The Guardian of the Threshold is also the title of the third play (of a tetralogy of Mystery Dramas) written by Rudolf Steiner in 1912. According to theosophy The Dweller on the Threshold, painted by R. Machell (1854–1927) The \\"Dweller of the Threshold\\" (or \\"Guardian of the Threshold\\") as a literary invention of the English mystic and novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton is found in his romance Zanoni (1842). After the founding of the Theosophical Society in 1875, the term gained wide currency in theosophical circles. The Guardian of the Threshold is a spectral figure and is the abstract of the debit and credit book of the individual. \\"It is the combined evil influence that is the result of the wicked thoughts and acts of the age in which any one may live, and it assumes to each student a definite shape at each appearance, being always either of one sort or changing each time\\"Eusebio Urban, Path, December, 1888 \\"This Dweller of the Threshold meets us in many shapes. It is the Cerberus guarding the entrance to Hades; the Dragon which St. Michael (spiritual will-power) is going to kill; the Snake which tempted Eve, and whose head will be crushed by the heel of the woman; the Hobgoblin watching the place where the treasure is buried, etc. He is the king of evil, who will not permit that within his kingdom a child should grow up, which might surpass him in power; the Herod before whose wrath the divine child Christ has to flee into a foreign country, and is not permitted to return to his home (the soul) until the king (Ambition, Pride, Vanity, Self- righteousness, etc.) is dethroned or dead.\\"Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889 According to Max Heindel, the Dweller on the Threshold must be confronted by every aspirant—usually at an early stage of his progress into the unseen worlds—and is one of the main causes of obsession.Max Heindel, The Web Destiny, Rosicrucian Fellowship In Rudolf Steiner's drama In Rudolf Steiner's play The Guardian of the Threshold, first performed in 1912 and the third in a series of four \\"Mystery Dramas\\", the appearance of the Guardian is connected with Lucifer and Ahriman. Steiner explained that the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold as presented in those dramas was to show that a person (man or woman) who had made the soul clairvoyant, must go back and forth across that threshold and know how to be rightly in the spiritual world on the far side, as well as on this side in the physical world.Rudolf Steiner, Secrets of the Threshold, VII  In popular culture  *In the short Cthulhu mythos novel The Lurker at the Threshold, the title entity is arguably another name for the same entity. *Van Morrison refers to himself as a \\"Dweller on the Threshold\\" in the song of that name on the album Beautiful Vision. *The term \\"Dweller on the Threshold\\" is used in television show, Twin Peaks, towards the conclusion of the series.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. He held the position of Geschwaderkommodore of fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 51 and Jagdgeschwader 52. Early life and career Beckh was born on 17 January 1908 in Nuremberg. He was a career soldier having joined the cavalry in 1926 as part of the-then 100,000 strong German Army. He joined the Luftwaffe with the rank of Oberleutnant in 1935 and trained to be a fighter pilot but Beckh had no particular aptitude for flying. World War II By the time World War II broke out he had already occupied several positions on the General Staff and because of his age did not fly any combat sorties. Instead, he was lecturing at the Air War Academy. It was during 1940 as Jägerverbindungsoffizier in the Luftgaukommando Wiesbaden (fighter communications or liaison officer) that he became close friends with Werner Mölders, the two men served in Jagdgeschwader 134 Horst Wessel. When Mölders became Geschwaderkommodore of JG 51 on 27 July 1940 he arranged for Beckh to transfer to his Geschwaderstab, as an officer on secondment from the General Staff. Beckh was nonetheless an enthusiastic fighter pilot. However, there was one further factor in Beckh's make-up that would constitute something of a handicap when flying fighters. He was simply unable to see anything in the air. In fact, Beckh's eyesight had deteriorated considerably since he had first joined the Luftwaffe. During the opening weeks of Operation Barbarossa Beckh had considerable success, mostly in tandem with his Wingman Leutnant Bernd Gallowitsch, who at the time was credited with around twenty victories. The two pilots invariably returned from sorties with a victory each. On 21 July 1941 Beckh was appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG 51 in succession to Werner Mölders and on 8 September while JG 51 supported Guderian's Panzerarmee in the battles around Kiev, Beckh claimed the Geschwader's 2000th victory.Bergström 2007a, p. 69. However, on 16 September his luck ran out during a fighter sweep in his Bf 109 F-2 and he was hit by flak, taking an incendiary round through the left foot. Two days after being wounded in action he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for 27 victories, 23 of them in Russia. He had also claimed around twenty aircraft destroyed on the ground. Initially he insisted on leading the Geschwader from the ground but on 3 October he was eventually admitted to a hospital with the foot infected. Beckh returned to the Geschwader on 21 December 1941 and he achieved approximately twenty further victories before being transferred back to the Reich Air Ministry on 9 April 1942. He was then appointed Kommodore of JG 52 on 3 June 1942 barely two months later following the death of Major Wilhelm Lessmann.Bergström 2007a, p. 52. On 21 June 1942 Beckh was airborne in his Bf 109 F-4 \\"weiße 4\\" W.Nr 13362 with his wingman for a low-level sortie of the type he preferred in the area of Izium-Kupiansk-Waluiki, east of Charkov. East of Waluiki the duo observed a Russian air base with Russian fighters on the ground. Beckh dived, claiming two fighters, but his wingman observed Beckh's F-4 taking a number of flak hits before it too nosed down and appeared to plunge to the ground. The Bf 109 came down in a marsh near Valuyki. His body was found inside his fighter when the site was excavated 60 years later.Bergström 2007, p. 53. At the time of his death he claimed over 40 aircraft in aerial combat and a dozen on the ground.Bergström 2007a, p. 52.

The 2011 census showed the population for the civil parish as 1,192. The civil parish includes the villages of Broom and Stanford and the hamlet of Ireland Its eastern fields are on the plain of the River Ivel; its west is hilly. The village centre is a close cluster. The principal residence, Southill Park, was one of at least four manors, and was for three generations the home of the local branch of the landed Byng family, the Viscounts Torrington, Navy admirals, by whom it was sold at the end of the 18th century to industrialist Samuel Whitbread. Admiral John Byng is buried in All Saints Church, which is a 14th and 15th century church embellished in 1814. Geography Southill lies about south-west of Biggleswade, south-west of Cambridge and north of London. Landscape The village straddles two National Character Areas (NCA) as designated by Natural England. High Street and Stanford Road lie within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands (NCA 88). Points west fall within the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge (NCA 90). Central Bedfordshire Council has locally classified the landscape as Lower Ivel Clay Valley (type 4B) where large, open arable fields predominate and the Mid Greensand Ridge (6B) which in addition to arable fields has significant areas of woodland, acid grassland and parkland. Elevation The village centre is above sea level. The land rises to over near Rowney Warren in the west of the parish. Geology and soil type High Street and Stanford Road lie on boulder clay over Ampthill clay. The remainder of the village together with Southill Park, Keepers' and Rowney Warrens lies on Lower Greensand. The village centre, Southill Park and west of the parish have low fertility, freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils. Land to the east of Stanford Road and to the north of the village has highly fertile, freely draining, slightly acid but base- rich soil with a loamy texture. Soil south of the village is highly fertile, lime-rich loamy and clayey with impeded drainage. The night sky and light pollution The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Southill is in band 3. History=Earliest written history Stigand's office as Archbishop of Canterbury spanned Saxon and Norman monarchies before his fall from grace. He is depicted well in the Bayeux Tapestry. Southill is part of the ancient hundred of Wixamtree and is mentioned as such seven times in the Domesday Book (detailing Southill landholdings of noblemen or freemen), some of which may be records as under-lords of the others (see subinfeudation). The total tax assessed was 9.7 geld units (very large) and recorded households numbered 29 (quite large). The Book shows sixteen freemen formerly owned its most valuable entry upon conquest, replaced by two Frenchmen at the time of its compilation in 1086. The annual value of this entry was estimated or attested as £3 upon conquest, £4 and a half pounds in 1070, then £4 in 1086. Southill landowners in 1086 included gentry Hugh of Beauchamp, Countess Judith (Judith of Lens) who founded nearby Elstow Abbey in 1078, Walter of Flanders, Richard Poynant, William of Cairon and Alric (Wintermilk) who was a Saxon landowner -- his very small £0.2-rated estate was substituted by one of equal worth, though valued at more in the interim and having 40% more ploughlands. The estates of Archbishop Stigand were seized nationwide in 1070 including one here. Earlier seized were two holdings of Leofwin the noble of Caddington taken on conquest and which holder the Book adds held under King Edward's overlordship. Church history All Saints Church, Southill is a 14th and 15th century church embellished in 1814 built in courses of ferrous rubble stone, part-dressed in ironstone and limestone, altered and extended in red and pale brick. Some areas are cement- or lime- rendered. The church contains floor and wall monuments to local people mainly from the 17th and 18th century, some of which in polychrome marble. It is a listed building in the middle category of statutorily protected heritage, Grade II*. Its chancel, heightened in brickwork, has a reworked 3-pane fifteenth century main window and similar age 5-pane window with a pointed arch facing south by a blocked-off pointed-arch doorway. A sepulchral vault to the Byng family built in rendered brickwork has a round-headed doorway facing their former park to the east. The nave has pointed-arch 5-and-a-half bay arcades, believed to have been built in 1814. The clerestory between the sides above two has 4 small windows per side. Most windows have plain sub-panes. The narrow aisles have two five-pane and four three-pane reworked late medieval windows, a doorway with pointed head of that date and an earlier pointed-arch 3-pane window, a later north-west door and later connection to the Byng vault. It small south porch ends in a gable, above a pointed-arch entrance supported by angle buttresses. The fifteenth century west tower has three stages with opposing square and clasping lightly buttressing walls topped by pale-brick- built battlements of differing heights. The west door has traceried spandrels, surmounted by 3-light window. The roofwork, low-slant, and seating is circa 1814. The font was designed in 1937 by Sir Albert Richardson. The Byng vault includes George Viscount Torrington, Rear Admiral who died in 1732 and Admiral John Byng, executed 1757. Later descriptions In 1805, a gazetteer reads: The equivalent in 1914 reads: Executed Admiral, The Honorable John Byng An event was held in the village in March 2007 and an eponymous real ale was brewed by B&T; Brewery in Shefford to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the execution of Admiral Byng. Former amenities The first mention of a post office in the village is in 1850. Post Office archives record the issue to Southill on 6 August 1850 of a type of postmark known as an undated circle. Rubber datestamps were issued in May 1889 and April 1895.Mackay, James A.

A residential airpark (also spelled air park) is also referred to as a \\"fly-in community\\". The word can also refer to a community specifically designed around an airport where the residents each would own their own airplane which they park in their hangar usually attached to the home or integrated into their home. The residential airpark or fly-in community features one or more runways with homes adjacent to the runway. Many fly-in communities feature a variety of amenities, such as golf course, equestrian facilities and more. Residential airparks or fly-in communities are usually privately owned and restricted to use by the property owners and their invited guests. Most do not include commercial operations or businesses. The communities have also become a niche real estate market, with some firms dedicated solely to these developments. The first airpark was Sierra Sky Park in Fresno, California, established in 1946. The Living With Your Plane Association estimates that there are at least 426 residential airparks in the United States. Florida is estimated to have 52 airparks, followed by Washington with 50, California with 28, and Oregon with 23.
