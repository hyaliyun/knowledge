It served as an infantry regiment, a cavalry regiment, and a mounted infantry (dragoon) unit, and had a mixed reputation. Its troops originally were recruited in 1861 as the 21st Virginia Infantry Battalion, or the \\"Pound Gap Battalion\\", with assurances that they would be fighting mostly near home in western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee and Kentucky. Many failed to re-enlist after their year of service ended in 1862. Morale was a problem, in part because of the poor clothing and provisions they were issued, as well as their initial duties of arresting and guarding Unionists in the tri-state region. Also, the 64th Virginia gained a reputation for lack of discipline. The 64th Regiment Virginia Mounted Infantry was organized in December 1862 in Abingdon, by consolidating the 21st and 29th Virginia Infantry Battalions. The 21st had been raised by Confederate Brigadier General Felix K. Zollicoffer (former Tennessee congressman) and Major John B. Thompson after the 1861 harvest, with soldiers volunteering for a year's service. It was supposed to defend Southwest Virginia from Pike County, Kentucky and the watershed of the Tug River to the Saltville, Virginia saltworks, including the Cumberland Gap. Its commander, Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall (a former Kentucky congressman) wanted these troops sent to Nashville, Tennessee, but the 5th Kentucky was sent instead, and the 21st Virginia did not have much recruiting success in Harlan County, Kentucky in 1862. Also, opposing forces led by Union Colonel (later General and President) James A. Garfield tried to win the hearts and minds of Kentuckians and southwest Virginians (which had no voters for Republican candidate Lincoln in the 1860 Presidential election, residents voting mostly for Breckinridge of Kentucky, whom Gen. Marshall had also supported, but a great percentage of whom enlisted once secession was declared and the harvest gathered).Jefrrey G. Weaver, 64th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg, H.E. Howard, Inc. The Virginia Regimental Histories Series; 1992) pp. 1-5 They were consolidated with the newly recruited 29th Virginia Infantry as 1861 ended. However, General Zollifoffer died in the Battle of Mill Springs in Kentucky on January 18, 1862 and so had limited association with the unit, and General Marshall would also resign in the late spring (he later withdraw his resignation but be assigned elsewhere). On September 9, 1862, Confederate brevet General John W. Frazer (the nomination was withdrawn after this debacle) surrendered most of this (dismounted) unit at the Cumberland Gap to Union General Ambrose Burnside. Col. Campbell Slemp of the 64th Virginia and Major Byron G. McDowell of the 62nd North Carolina however, slipped out into the mountains with about 600 men rather than surrender, and re-formed their unit at Zollicoffer, Tennessee (now Bluff City, Tennessee). Captain William R. Boles of the 64th Virginia jumped on Col. Frazer and tried to beat him up when he heard the order, but was pulled off by Union officers. Many of the 1,026 Confederate prisoners (425 of them members of this unit, plus troops from Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) were sent to Louisville, Kentucky then to Camp Douglas (Chicago). There, about 150 died in the unsanitary conditions and 43 men enlisted in the Union Army or Navy to escape the horrible prison camp. Col. Frazer wrote his official account of the Battle of the Cumberland Gap while a Union prisoner at another camp.Weaver pp. 69-74 The surrender necessitated a late 1862 reorganization; the unit was sometimes known as the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry or the 64th Virginia Infantry. After September 1, 1863, it was also called the 64th Virginia Cavalry because another reorganization in October 1863 briefly placed the 64th Virginia in Brig. John Stuart Williams' Cavalry Brigade. However, that brigade drew ill will in the Lee County area by its methods of confiscating provisions, especially horses to replace mounts. Moreover, on October 20, 1863, a federal raiding party sent by Union General Wilcox surprised Slemp's encamped 64th Infantry near Jonesville and managed to destroy much of their equipment and supplies. On November 5, 1863, Williams' brigade managed to intercept the federal raiders, but the 64th Virginia basically tagged along. In January 1864, Col. Slemp was court-martialed by Brig. Gen. \\"Grumble\\" Jones for dereliction of duty based on events of November 7, 1863, when Slemp ordered 10 or 15 wagons captured from the enemy moved, endangering the column if attacked while on the road from Rogersville to Blountville. Although many Virginians (including legislators) tried to get the charges dropped (and his Lt. Col. Auburn L. Pridemore tried to press charges against Gen. Jones for leapfrogging past Col. Giltner's 4th Kentucky Cavalry and crossing the Holston River behind enemy forces on that specified date), Capt. H. Brown of the 8th Virginia Cavalry and Major Rhea of Tennessee (neither units in Williams' command) continued to press the dereliction and ill-discipline charges. Col. Slemp hurt his cause by slipping house arrest in Abingdon prior to trial and instead returning home to Lee County; he was convicted, relieved of command and dismissed from the Confederate army.Weaver pp. 69-78 Later the 64th Virginia continued to confront the Federals in various conflicts in East Tennessee, Western Virginia, and North Carolina until the war's end. However, its equipment and manpower problems continued. During April 1864, it totaled 268 effectives, but in April 1865, fewer than 50 disbanded. The major field officers (all future U.S. congressmen) were Colonels Campbell Slemp of Company A, Auburn L. Pridemore of Company C, and Lieutenant Colonel James B. Richmond (after January 1863); as well as Major Harvey Gray (of Company E and F, especially after February 1864).

Its current configuration was created in 1827 when the river's mouth was moved to its present location. The western half of Whiskey Island is occupied by the Cleveland Bulk Terminal. The eastern section is home to a marina and public park, known as Wendy Park, which forms part the Lakefront Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks. The peninsula is long and at its widest, bounded by Lake Erie to the north, West 54th Street on the west (roughly), and the Cuyahoga River to the south and east. History Whiskey Island Coast Guard station in 2018. Halite from the salt mine. The Whiskey Island Huletts. 1800s Whiskey Island was the first piece of solid land amid the swamps lining the river one-quarter mile down the Cuyahoga when Moses Cleaveland visited the area in 1796. Lorenzo Carter built his family farm on Whiskey Island, which got its name after a distillery was built on the site in the 1830s. The area was settled, largely by Irish immigrants, when the Ohio and Erie Canal was constructed in 1825 and the river was rechanneled in 1827. In 1831 the Buffalo Co. and the New Harbor Co., representing investors from Buffalo and Brooklyn, purchased the Carter farm and divided its into allotments along 22 streets. Manufacturing plants and docks were constructed. The Lake Erie Iron Works made steamboat shafts and railroad axles on the island and thirteen saloons were located in the area. Cleveland's second hospital, the \\"pest house,\\" was built on Whiskey Island following the Cholera epidemic of 1832. The Cleveland and Toledo Railroad (later the New York Central) ran its northern division through Whiskey Island \\"stopping at the river to ferry its passengers across the Cuyahoga because the city refused permission for the railroad to connect to the eastbound line\\". 1900s The Irish moved from Whiskey Island when better employment and housing opportunities became available and except for a Depression-era Hooverville, Whiskey Island was left largely to the railroads, a salt mine owned by Cargill, and the set of four large Hulett ore unloaders at the Pennsylvania Railway Ore Dock, which when built in 1911 was the largest ore-unloading dock on the Great Lakes. The Huletts were dismantled by the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority in 2000 to create room for additional bulk storage. Two of the Hullets were scrapped, and the other two were disassembled and remain on the site. The Coast Guard built its Cleveland station at the end of a pier north of Whiskey Island. A second station, designed by architect J. Milton Dyer, opened in 1940. The Coast Guard operated at the site until 1976, when they relocated the search and rescue station to new facilities at the Coast Guard moorings on East Ninth Street. The old station has sat unused since then, except for a brief period in the early 1990s when it served as a nightclub. The City of Cleveland purchased the station for $1 in 2003, and is developing plans for its restoration and reuse. 2000s In the early 2000s, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority pursued the purchase of the eastern portion of Whiskey Island in order to expand port facilities; however, the port did not buy the land. The open space and marina were purchased by Cuyahoga County in 2004 and preserved as a public park. The area's protection was due in large part to the efforts of activist Ed Hauser, known as the \\"Mayor of Whiskey Island\\". Wendy Park at Whiskey Island opened to the public in 2005, and includes sand volleyball courts, a prairie garden, and a restaurant-bar. In 2014, Whiskey Island was purchased by the Cleveland Metroparks. About 7,000 people visited Wendy Park in 2005. The number rose to more than 180,000 in 2010.

The ZeBu compiler does automation chip division, where one SoC is divided into multiple FPGAs based on user specified parameters for input file paths, such as EDIF Netlist, number of FPGAs the ZeBu board has, and the number of CPUs used for compilation. ZeBu has static, dynamic and flexible probes for retrieving and depositing data. Static and flexible probes are created during compilation, with speeds exceeding 10 MHz. Dynamic probes do not require compilation, and slow down the execution speed of the emulator to few kilohertz. ZeBu can be used by up to 25 multiple concurrent users.

He had previously worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment from 1924, and during World War I had served as a pilot in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force, becoming a flying ace credited with 15 aerial victories. Biography=Early life and education Coombes was born in Madras, India, and educated in London. From 1915 he studied engineering at the City and Guilds College in London, but in July 1917 he took leave of absence from his studies in order to enlist in the Royal Naval Air Service. Military career Coombes was assigned to on 22 July 1917 as a probationary flight officer, and attended the training schools at Air Stations Chingford and Cranwell, before being awarded his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate at Air Station Fairlop on 20 September. He was promoted to flight sub-lieutenant on 28 September, and posted to HMS Daedalus in November. Coombes was eventually sent to France, and was initially assigned to No. 12 Naval Squadron based at Air Station Dunkirk from 11 January 1918, but was reassigned to No. 10 Naval Squadron two weeks later. Flying the Sopwith Camel, Coombes gained his first aerial victory on 24 March, destroying an Albatros D.V over Menin- Roulers. By the time of his second victory on 9 April (another D.V destroyed north of La Bassée), the Royal Naval Air Service had been merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and No. 10 Naval Squadron had been renamed No. 210 Squadron RAF. Coombes drove down three more enemy aircraft in May, and on 12 June he was appointed acting-captain while serving as a flight commander. In June and July he was credited with shooting down ten more aircraft, bringing his total number of victories to fifteen. Coombes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 3 August, then returned to England to spend the rest of the war serving as an instructor at No. 204 Training Depot Station at RAF Eastchurch. Coombes left the RAF on 17 April 1919, and spent the rest of the summer barnstorming around the north of England in surplus B.E.2's with Charles Kingsford Smith before returning to City and Guilds College, to finally receive his Engineering degree in mid-1920. Engineering career After four years working for C. A. Parsons & Co. in Newcastle upon Tyne, Coombes joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment as a Scientific Officer in the Aerodynamics Department. A year later, in 1925, he moved to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe, where he also acted as a technical advisor to the RAF's High Speed Flight, competing for the 1927 Schneider Trophy. Coombes remained a member of the Reserve of Air Force Officers (RAFO), being promoted to flying officer on 29 May 1923, but eventually relinquished his commission on 29 May 1926. In 1930 he returned to the Royal Aircraft Establishment where he was in charge of the Seaplane Tank. In 1938 Coombes emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, after being appointed the first Chief Superintendent of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), a division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1949 ARL was transferred to the Research and Development Branch of the Department of Supply, becoming one of the Defence Science Laboratories. In 1960, while serving as an advisor for the United Nations, Coombes helped India establish its first Aeronautical Research Laboratory. Coombes retired in 1964, and in June was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \\"for services to aviation\\". Coombes died in Melbourne on 3 June 1988. Personal life On 6 April 1926 he married Annie Marie (\\"Nancy\\") Lee, and they had two daughters; Shirley Ruth (b. 1928) and Josephine (b. 1932).

The highway runs from MD 387 and MD 450 north to MD 450 within Annapolis. MD 435 connects MD 450 with the West Annapolis neighborhood and Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The state highway was constructed along most of its current course in the late 1920s. MD 435 and MD 436 switched parts of their routes, with MD 435 attaining its presenting course, in the mid-1950s. Route description View south at the north end of MD 435 at MD 450 in Annapolis MD 435 begins at Westgate Circle, a roundabout whose other legs are MD 450 (West Street) and MD 387 (Spa Road). The highway heads north along Taylor Avenue, a two-lane undivided municipally maintained road along the east side of Annapolis National Cemetery. MD 435 passes through an S-curve as it passes the Annapolis Police Department and an old railroad grade. The highway becomes state maintained just south of Rosedale Street. MD 435 curves to the east as it passes along the east side of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, the home stadium of the Navy Midshipmen football team. The highway intersects MD 70 (Roscoe Rowe Boulevard) and meets the southern end of MD 436 (Ridgely Avenue) in the West Annapolis neighborhood. MD 435 turns south from Taylor Avenue onto Annapolis Street and enters the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy. The highway curves east again and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 450, which heads east across the Severn River on Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard and south toward downtown Annapolis on King George Street. History The Maryland State Roads Commission paved several streets with concrete in West Annapolis in 1929 and 1930; those streets became part of four state highways. MD 435 was constructed as an road beginning at the Annapolis, Washington and Baltimore Railroad. The state highway followed Taylor Avenue north to Annapolis Street, continued north on Annapolis Street to Severn Avenue (now Melvin Avenue), then followed Severn Avenue to Wardour Drive. The portion of modern MD 435 from Taylor Avenue to MD 2 (now MD 450) was MD 436. The two other state highways in West Annapolis were MD 437, which followed Revell Street (now Ridgely Avenue) from Taylor Avenue to Severn Avenue, and MD 438, which followed Severn Avenue west one block from Annapolis Street then north along what is now MD 436. MD 435 was extended south along Division Street to West Street, which then carried US 50 and MD 2, by 1946. MD 435 assumed its modern routing between intersections with MD 450 in 1954. The Annapolis Street part of MD 435 became the southernmost part of MD 436. The Melvin Avenue part of MD 435 became MD 438. MD 437 remained along Ridgely Avenue between Taylor Avenue and Melvin Avenue. MD 436 assumed its modern routing and MD 437 and MD 438 were removed from the state highway system in 1975.

History The current Carpenter Gothic church building was constructed in 1901 Heinrich C. Brandt, but the church congregation and its Wesleyan tradition date back to 1849. In 1849, Chappell Hill's founders, Jacob Haller and Mary Hargrove Haller, dedicated an acre, adjacent to the Chappell Hill Academy, for a church site. Five years earlier the national Methodist Episcopal Church had split into a Northern and Southern conference after being united since the founding of Methodism in America in 1789. The first church building was erected in 1853 and continually served as a house of worship until September 9, 1900 when it was destroyed by the Great Storm of 1900. The present building was constructed in 1901. The two General Conferences, Methodist Episcopal Church (or northern section) and Methodist Episcopal Church, South, remained separate until the 1939 merger of these two denominations plus a third, the Methodist Protestant Church, the resulting church being known as the Methodist Church. On April 23, 1968, the United Methodist Church was created when the Evangelical United Brethren Church and the Methodist Church joined hands at the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas. The church continues as an active and growing congregation in the twenty-first century, with a full-time ordained pastor, weekly worship services and faith-based activities almost every day of the week. The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

A right-hander whose pro career extended from 1961 through 1968, he was listed as tall and . Umbach was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, but grew up in Auburn, Alabama; he graduated from Tennessee's Baylor School, then later returned to his home city to earn a degree from Auburn University. Fresh off his schoolboy career, he signed a $100,000 bonus contract with the Braves in June 1961. After four seasons in the club's farm system, he was called up to Milwaukee in September 1964 and given a start in the club's next-to-last game of the season, October 3 against the Pittsburgh Pirates at County Stadium. He went 8 innings and departed with an 11–3 lead after surrendering 11 hits and four bases on balls. Two unearned runs would score off Umbach's successor on the mound, Baseball Hall of Fame southpaw Warren Spahn (in Spahn's 714th and final appearance in a Brave uniform), but Umbach secured the victory in his MLB debut. After spending 1965 at Triple-A, Umbach worked in 22 games during 1966, the Braves' first year in Atlanta, losing his only two decisions but posting a solid 3.10 earned run average. Of his 22 appearances, three were starts, and on June 4, he held the St. Louis Cardinals to seven hits and one unearned run, again going 8 innings. But he departed the game with the score tied at one, and his reliever, veteran Ted Abernathy, got credit for the victory when Atlanta broke through with the winning tally in the home half of the ninth. Umbach appeared in 23 MLB games, and fashioned a 1–2 won–lost record. He permitted 51 hits and 22 bases on balls in 49 career innings pitched, with 30 strikeouts. After the 1966 season, he was included in a blockbuster trade that sent longtime Braves star Eddie Mathews, also a future Hall of Famer, to the Houston Astros. But Umbach never appeared in a Houston uniform and retired after only two Double-A appearances in 1968. In addition to Auburn University, Umbach attended law school at the University of Alabama and Emory University and after his pitching career ended he was a practicing attorney in his home city of Auburn. He died at his home there on May 30, 2020, due to complications from Parkinson's disease.

Early life  Cornelius Anckarstierna was born on 25 January 1655 in Stockholm. His father, Didrik Corneliusson Thijsen, was of Dutch origin and was a naval officer in the Swedish navy. Anckarstierna spent his childhood accompanying his father on his journeys. After joining the navy, he quickly rose through the ranks. In 1669, he became a lieutenant, and in 1676 a captain.  Combat with the Danes and ennoblement  In the naval battle near Møn on 1 June 1677, he commanded the ship Kalmar castle with 74 cannons. When Anckarstierna was about to be defeated by the Danish admiral Bielke, he targeted two shots through the ballast of his own ship so that it sank. In 1678, Anckarstierna became a major and was ennobled. He was appointed to schoutbynacht in 1680, and vice admiral in 1683. The Swedish king Charles XI appointed Anckarstierna in 1692 to admiral of Ousbyholm in Hörby parish, Skåne.  Later years  Anckarstierna was in command of the Swedish fleet's second squadron during the landing on Zealand in 1700. He served as commander- in-chief the same year when Charles XII was transferred to Livonia and in 1705 during the failed landing on the island Retusari in the Gulf of Finland. He died in Knutstorp in 1714. Anckarstierna was married twice: first with Elisabeth Kröger, whom he had two sons and one daughter with, and then with Ms. Sparre, whom he had two daughters and one son with.

It is drawn by James Barry.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061688652/Warriors_Ravenpaws_Path_1_Shattered_Peace/index.aspx Plot Ravenpaw explains his life and on the farm, saying that he liked it there, as well as the battle with BloodClan and the Twolegs. Then, Ravenpaw and his friend Barley run down a hill and play; such as Ravenpaw doing the hunters' crouch and starts to teach it to Barley, Ravenpaw starting to chew on some grass and instructs Barley to do so also, saying that it's juicy. The next morning, Barley wakes Ravenpaw up and shows him that it is snowing. When Ravenpaw goes onto the roof to take a drink of water, his tongue gets stuck and he doesn't want Barley to see him. He brings back a mouse and Barley says Ravenpaw's talking funny, however Ravenpaw denies it. They then start to cleaning the barn and Barley asks if Ravenpaw misses the clans. Ravenpaw tells him that clan life wasn't for him and that the barn suits him much better. Later, when they are going to sleep, they hear a scratching noise near the door. Ravenpaw and Barley look outside and see a group of cats standing there, whose names they find out to be, are; Willie, Minty, Snapper, Tess and Pounce. They plead to come in and Willie says that his mate is about to have kits. Ravenpaw welcomes them kindly, and feeds them. Soon, the kits are born, and they are named; Snowflake, Icicle, Cloudy and Sniff. Ravenpaw and Barley seem to be very fond of them. They continue to be their \\"servants\\" and Barley doesn't seem to enjoy it, but Ravenpaw is used to it, since he used to belong to a Clan. Later, Ravenpaw and Willie are standing on the wood below the roof of the barn when Ravenpaw explains that they can't hunt the chickens in the coop. Willie only nods and says he won't hunt them. One day, Barley catches Snapper teaching the kits death blows, but Barley says nothing to them and tells Ravenpaw when they're on the top of the barn. Ravenpaw only says it is nonsense and they need to protect those precious kits. Then, Barley overhears Willie and Snapper talking about having their own territory but doesn't say a word about it. When the group of cats are ready to leave, Ravenpaw was very sad and is reluctant to let them leave, but Barley was relieved. He then cleans the barn while Ravenpaw is sleeping. Later, Ravenpaw and Barley discuss the cats, Ravenpaw accuses Barley of treating the cats like they were intruders. Barley tells him that since his background was with the Clan, it made a difference. He also questions Ravenpaw's belonging in the barn which shocks and offends Ravenpaw. It also makes him think that maybe he does belong in the clans. When Ravenpaw falls asleep, Barley wakes him up and escapes when the farm catches on fire. They escape but Ravenpaw tells Barley they need to save the dogs. They dig up the metal stick holding the dog's down and run off before the dogs attack them. The two cats decide they need to get out of the fire so they run through the window into the Twoleg nest. They think it is some kind of nightmare though they know the Twolegs are happy there they never want to go there again. Ravenpaw and Barley sleep outside of the barn. On a hunting expedition the next day, Barley finds a dead rabbit that neither Ravenpaw nor Barley killed. When they go to the barn, they find Willie, Tess, Pounce and Snapper on the wood below the roof. Ravenpaw greets them warmly. Then, the three cats attack the chickens. Ravenpaw and Barley try to stop them but it was too late and the other cats had escaped. The farmer accuses Ravenpaw and Barley for trying to steal the chickens and kicks them out. They meet Willie and the cats again and find out they were BloodClan trying to remake the lost \\"clan\\". The cats start to fight. Then, under a bush, Minty and her kits are terrified and Minty breaks up the fight and promises that Ravenpaw and Barley have learned their lesson. That night, they sleep in the rain and Ravenpaw apologizes to Barley about not listening to him, and Barley replies saying that it's okay. The next morning, Ravenpaw sees Highstones from the distance and they decide to go there. They go into it and Ravenpaw speaks to StarClan. Bluestar, Whitestorm and Spottedleaf come and welcome him warmly. Ravenpaw is surprised that they remembered him after he left the Clans. They say that they've seen his and Barley's troubles and tells him to go to Firestar and ask for help. Ravenpaw says that he turned his back to the Clans and he doesn't deserve their loyalty anymore. Bluestar's reply is, \\"Maybe not, but you still have their friendship.\\" Whitestorm, Bluestar, and Spottedleaf each take turns telling him good luck. When Ravenpaw wakes up, he wakes Barley up immediately telling him they need help from ThunderClan.  Critical reception  \\"Since this is the first \\"Warriors\\" book I have read, I was pleased to find that the author includes enough information before the first chapter that I could understand what was happening from the start. In this addition to the series, Ravenpaw decides to leave the security of his association with the Thunderclan and move to the Farm. There, he lives with his friend Barley, enjoying the kind of peaceful life a cat is suppose to have. He enjoys the calm nights, hearing the rooster, and the safe feeling he has all the time. Then, one day, a group of cats arrive and ask to stay with them for a few days. After they leave, the Thunderclan returns with bad intentions. Ravenpaw must draw on his past to defend his home, his friend, and himself. Books written in graphic format are favorites of mine! They are perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on also will enjoy the graphics, the exhilarating story, and the fast-paced text. The story is suitable for both boys and girls, and it is a good choice for children who like adventure stories and animal tales. The wonderful artwork adds much to the story. It is a fun read with a story that moves quickly and smoothly.\\" — Kathie M.

Sheridan had risen to lieutenant by the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, and with the resumption of hostilities in 1803 was serving in the English Channel. Here he acquitted himself well in several actions, after which he moved to the Baltic and was active in several engagements against the Russians during the Anglo-Russian War. Promoted to commander as a result, he took the bomb vessel to North America and was present at the assault on Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, actions which inspired the writing of the poem that became the words to \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". Promoted to post-captain towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars he retired ashore, and died in 1862 with the rank of vice-admiral. Career Sheridan was born c. 1778 and entered the navy in 1795, shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He rose quickly through the ranks, was promoted to lieutenant on 21 December 1801 and by 1803 was senior lieutenant aboard , which was then serving in the English Channel under Commander Edward Pelham Brenton. On 27 October 1803 Merlin and the schooner captured the 2-gun privateer Sept Frères, after which Sheridan saw action at the bombardments of Le Havre on 23 July and 1 August 1804. Sheridan then took part in the burning of the wreck of the frigate near Barfleur on 10 December 1804, the Shannon having run aground under French shore batteries while sailing in company with Merlin. Sheridan went on to be active during the war with Russia which broke out in 1807, serving aboard . He was present at the capture of three Russian ships off the coast of Finland, and at the attack on several Russian gunboats at Percola Point. In the latter action, a Russian flotilla was attacked on the night of 7 July by 17 boats, led by Lieutenant Hawkey of , who was killed in the action. Seven of the eight gunboats were captured, and 12 craft containing stores for the army were also taken. For his actions during the engagement Sheridan was promoted to commander. The Bombardment of Fort McHenry. Sheridan was given command of the newly built bomb vessel , and commissioned her on 7 October 1813. He went out with her to North America to support British operations there during the War of 1812, and at 9pm on 12 September 1814 Terror and the bomb vessels , , , and , and the rocket vessel anchored off Fort McHenry to support land-based operations in the Battle of Baltimore. They commenced firing at daylight, but could not inflict much damage, and after making a probing assault by boat, the British withdrew. The assault was witnessed by Francis Scott Key, who was inspired to write a poem describing the events, which later became the words to the United State's national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Sheridan later served off the coast of Georgia, being promoted to post-captain in June 1815 towards the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, and being succeeded in the command of Terror that month by Constantine Richard Moorsom. He did not serve again at sea following the end of the wars, though he continued to rise through the ranks according to his seniority.

Liquid ventilators are prototypes that may have been used for animal experimentations but experts recommend continued development of a liquid ventilator toward clinical applications. Function and technology=Driving liquid In total liquid ventilation (TLV), the lungs are completely filled with a perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquid while the liquid ventilator renews the tidal volume of PFC. The liquid ventilator operates in mandatory mode: it must force the PFC in and out of the lungs with a pumping system. * During the inspiratory phase, the pump generates a positive driving pressure in the trachea to ensure the PFC insertion of the tidal volume. * During the expiratory phase, the pump generates a negative driving pressure in the trachea to ensure PFC withdrawal of the tidal volume. The pumping system is either a peristaltic pump (in the simplest liquid ventilators) or two piston pumps (in the most advanced liquid ventilators). Because of the PFC viscosity, the head loss in the airways requires a low negative driving pressure during the expiration phase that can collapse the airways. This is the choked flow phenomenon in TLV which compromises the minute ventilation and consequently the gas exchanges. To address this limitation, liquid ventilator integrates a control of the pumping system. Controlling liquid ventilator The introduction of computers in liquid ventilators to control the pumping system provides different control modes, monitoring and valuable data for decision making. The liquid ventilator is always volume-controlled because the specified tidal volume of PFC must be accurately delivered and retrieved. It is also pressure-limited because it must stop the expiratory or inspiratory phase when a too low, or a too large, driving pressure is detected. However, during the expiratory phase, the expiratory flow can be commanded by an open-loop controller or a closed-loop controller: * when the expiratory flow is open-loop controlled, it is fast initially and slowing down progressively after to minimize the risk of collapse generation. * when the expiratory flow is closed-loop controlled, it is commanded in real-time to maintain a specified driving pressure. This is a pressure-regulated mode. Such approach automatically avoids collapse generation. Also, during the inspiratory phase, the volume-controlled mode is realized by open-loop or closed loop control of the PFC flow. Oxygenating and heating liquid The liquid ventilator removes Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the PFC by saturating it with oxygen (O2) and medical air. This procedure can be performed with either a membrane oxygenator (a technology used in extracorporeal oxygenators) or a bubble oxygenator. The liquid ventilator heats the PFC to body temperature. This is performed with a heat exchanger connected to the oxygenator or with dedicated heaters integrated in the oxygenator. The oxygenator and the heater produce PFC vapor which is recuperated with a condenser in order to limit the evaporation loss (the PFC is a greenhouse gas). Example Example of the pumping cycle in a liquid ventilator (Inolivent-4, research group Inolivent, Université de Sherbrooke) An example of a liquid ventilator is the Inolivent-4. It is composed of two independent piston pumps and integrated unit allowing for oxygenation of PFC, temperature control, and recovery of evaporated PFC. This liquid ventilator also includes volume and pressure control strategies to optimize the ventilatory cycle: it performs a pressure-regulated volume-controlled ventilation mode. It is designed for experimental research on animal models weighing between 0.5 kg to 9 kg. A typical cycle is composed of four steps : # Inspiratory pump inserts a volume of PFC in the lungs (valve 1 open, valve 2 closed), and the expiratory pump pushes PFC in the oxygenator via the filter (valve 3 closed, valve 4 open). # During the inspiratory pause (all valves are closed), the lung volume is at its maximal value. The measured pressure is the Positive End-Inspiratory Pressure (PEIP). # Expiratory pump retrieves a volume of PFC in the lungs (valve 3 open, valve 4 closed), and the inspiratory pump draws PFC from the reservoir (valve 1 closed, valve 2 open). # During the expiratory pause (all valves are closed), the lung volume is at its minimal value. The measured pressure is the Positive End-expiratory Pressure (PEEP). Potential applications Studies have shown both the efficacy and safety of liquid ventilation in normal, mature and immature newborn lungs. Overall, liquid ventilation improves gas exchange and lung compliance and prevents the lungs against ventilation-induced lung injury. Respiratory support Studies suggest clear benefits of liquid ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For example, total liquid ventilation could be used for newborns with severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in which conventional treatment has failed. Typical cases are late preterm newborns who have an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and for whom their small vessel size poses technical limitations for Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therapeutic lung lavage Liquid ventilator can perform therapeutic lung lavage, the washout of endogenous and exogenous debris from the lungs, without suspension of ventilation support (without apnea). For example, literature data suggest a radical change in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) by considering the use of a liquid ventilator. The demonstration of its efficacy was performed in the neonatal lamb.. Therapeutic hypothermia with rapid cooling The liquid ventilator with advanced control temperature of PFC allows the rapid cooling of the body. Consequently, therapeutic hypothermia is an expected clinical application. For example, studies present that rapid cooling instituted by TLV can improve cardiac and mitochondrial function or can induce favorable neurological and cardiac outcomes after cardiac arrest in rabbits.

The name of the village is often misspelled as \\"Tacumshin\\" as opposed to \\"Tacumshane\\". The lake and townland is spelled \\"Tacumshin\\", while the village and parish are spelled \\"Tacumshane\\". About two miles away is the townsland of Churchtown which was once called Tacumshane. It is where Tacumshane castle stood until it was demolished in 1984 by a local farmer. The Fence is the townsland located in the village of Tacumshane today. Tacumshane Windmill Tacumshane Windmill The windmill was built in 1846 by Nicolas Moran and was used until 1936, making it the last windmill in the Republic to work commercially. It was renovated in the 1950s. It is the oldest working windmill in Ireland. Access is managed via the nearby pub, \\"The Millhouse Bar\\". Tacumshin Lake Tacumshin Lake or Lough as its locally known is 1100 acres in size and is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) by the National Parks and Wildlife Services. Closed naturally since 1972, with a barrier of dune. A tidal system know locally as “the tunnel” was constructed in the 1970s making the Lough tidal. A new system was built in the 1990s. Tachumshin Lake is a favourite with bird watchers. It attracts some rare American waders in Autumn, as well as internationally important concentrations of Bewick's swans, Brent geese, wigeon, oystercatchers, golden plover and lapwing. Transport Bus Éireann route 378 serves Tacumshane on Fridays only and provides a link to and from Wexford. Its terminus is at Wexford railway station.

The library was founded by the Chappell Hill Circulating Library Association in 1893, due to the generosity of W.G. Foote, Jr, who donated the library owned by his late father, Dr. W. G. Foote, Sr. Dr. Foote was a Methodist minister and a professor at Chappell Hill's Soule University during the mid-nineteenth century. The collection was stored in various places for the first several years, until the newly formed Civic Club founded by local ladies decided to build a new library on Cedar Street (once called College St.) The three directors of the Circulating Library Association were Mrs. Fannie A. Campbell, Mrs. Joe E. Routt, and Miss Nannie Adams. It was built in 1912 in a Colonial Revival style by J.W. Heartfield. The plan is nearly square, 20' x 24', with clapboard siding and corner beads. There is a hipped roof that is now asphalt, but was once shingled in cedar. The front elevation exhibits a semi-circular portico supported by two Doric columns capped with oversized capitals and two pilasters. The interior is simple, with a single room adorned with beaded board wainscoting along the perimeter. Inside is a wrought iron fence from the balcony of the Hiram Thompson home. When the Chappell Hill Female College closed down in 1912, they donated many of their books to the new public library. Some of them bear the name of the \\"Philomathean Society,\\" one of two literary societies on the college campus. Over the years, the building wore down and was damaged. By 1964, its columns were collapsing. Descendants of the original members of the Circulating Library Association decided that it should be saved and formed the Chappell Hill Historical Society. They ran a number of fundraisers, the largest of which was the Antique Show, held during the overlap between National Library Week and one of the Bluebonnet Trail Weekends, and thus the Bluebonnet Festival was born. That year they were able to restore the library, and to their delight, discovered that the collection was intact! The Historical Society continues to work to preserve the library, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 1985.

Following this, he declared his rebellion in Kufa. He then liberated the two prisons of Kufa of all those interred. He then left Kufa for its agricultural hinterland (the Sawad) and settled in a place called Bustan. He was followed and supported by a group of Zaydis, Bedouins living near Bustan and people from other certain places near Kufa.

It was directed by Eric Forsberg and stars Tiffany, Paul Logan and Barry Williams. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, this film is a mockbuster of Piranha 3D. It was filmed in Belize, Central America.  Plot  The film focuses on the Orinoco River in Venezuela, where a strain of genetically modified piranha have escaped into an isolated tributary of the river. Through human interference of the local environment, the megapiranha manage to escape from their isolated spot and swim downstream, killing all that crosses their path. The megapiranha gradually make their way towards Florida\\"Mega Piranha\\". The Asylum at the height of the tourist season. After the outbreak, a team including Special Agent Fitch and Sarah Monroe, work to contain the megapiranhas within Venezuela. They begin to get into trouble with the authorities when they attempt to cross over the Venezuelan border. Not having proper clearance and documentation, Special Agent Fitch resorts to using the diplomacy of his fist and drives off. He is pursued by Colonel Antonio Diaz in a high-speed chase through the jungle. Throughout the chase, Fitch alternates driving a Toyota Camry and Hyundai Elantra while Diaz is seen at different points in a GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Suburban, Suzuki XL7, and Ford Explorer. Fitch escapes by stealing a helicopter and heads to the International Super Bunker (ISB). During the journey, the helicopter runs out of fuel and Sarah Monroe rigs the emergency oxygen tank to the fuel line to make it to the ISB safely. The megapiranhas continue to move north, consuming two battleships and a nuclear submarine. They eventually reach south Florida, where they kill at least five Puerto Ricans on a beach and manage to blow up two hotels. Meanwhile, the only force that can stop them is located at the ISB. After the megapiranhas prove impervious to both torpedoes and depth charges—and even a nuclear torpedo fails to stop them—Special Agent Fitch and Professor Sarah Monroe conclude that the only way to stop the megapiranhas is to face them in their own terrain: underwater. An army of SCUBA divers armed with guns would make the huge fish bleed, causing them to enter a feeding frenzy and kill each other. If this were to fail, then a massive nuclear strike would be used to destroy the megapiranha, as well as most of Florida. In the middle of the operation, Colonel Diaz arrives in a helicopter, presumably using multiple fuel tanks to do this journey. The Colonel aims to get revenge on Agent Fitch and throws a rope into the water to trick him into climbing up into the enemy helicopter. Fitch, upon his arrival, shoots the pilot in the mouth with a flare gun, which causes the pilot's head to explode. Fitch then uses a homing beacon (which is actually a canister of CO2) to attract a megapiranha, jumping out of the helicopter shortly before it is consumed by the fishy behemoth. Fitch is pursued by the megapiranha that ate the helicopter, eventually hiding in a reef where the megapiranha is unable to follow. When the piranha opens its mouth, Fitch shoots his gun at the helicopter still in the beast's jaws. The helicopter explodes, killing the fish. The other megapiranha converge on the bloodshed and Fitch is able to escape as the piranha enters a feeding frenzy and begin tearing each other to pieces, seemingly resulting in them wiping themselves out. Sarah and Fitch make out and all is well.  Cast  Production  The mockbuster was produced to capitalise on the 2010 film Piranha 3-D.The Asylum breeding a Mega Piranha. dreadcentral.com On March 29, 2010 the SyFy Channel released an exclusive sneak peek of a scene from the filmMega Piranha Sneak Peek .craptasticmovies.com in anticipation of its April 10 premiere of the film.Syfy Offers Second Look at Mega Piranha. dreadcentral.com On the April 7, 2010 The Asylum released the official trailer online. Usual Asylum audience may notice the film recycles short clips from other Asylum films, likely due to low production costs and a limited filming schedule. Such clips come from films like Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus, Journey to Middle Earth, War of the Worlds and Transmorphers: Fall of Man.  Reception  Dread Central wrote about the film: \\"Now, the question becomes whether Mega Piranha means we should expect a super-sized piranha a la Asylum's Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus or if they are basing their film around the prehistoric Megapiranha, a toothier, three-foot version of the carnivorous fish that became extinct millions of years ago. Given the big screen 3D remake is about these Megapiranha, I would say odds are high the latter will prove the case. The film reached a 2.2 million audience for its April 10 premiere, making it the channel's most-watched movie of the year. Of those, 807,000 were adults 18-49.  Trivia  The film was broadcast on Tele 5 as part of the programme format SchleFaZ in season 1.

He writes the computer programming blog Coding Horror. He co-founded the computer programming question-and-answer website Stack Overflow and co-founded Stack Exchange, which extends Stack Overflow's question-and-answer model to subjects other than programming. Atwood's most recent project as of 2012 is the development of Discourse, an open source Internet discussion platform. Career Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood at MIX 2009 Atwood started a programming blog, Coding Horror, in 2004. As a result, he met Joel Spolsky, among others. In 2007, Jeff Atwood made the quote that was popularly referred to as Atwood’s Law: > “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be > written in JavaScript.” In 2008, together with Spolsky, Atwood founded Stack Overflow, a programming question-and-answer website. The site quickly became very popular, and was followed by Server Fault for system administrators, and Super User for general computer-related questions, eventually becoming the Stack Exchange network which includes many Q&A; websites about topics decided on by the community. From 2008 to 2014, Atwood and Spolsky published a weekly podcast covering the progress on Stack Exchange and a wide range of software development issues. Jeff Atwood was also a keynote presenter at the 2008 Canadian University Software Engineering Conference. In February 2012, Atwood left Stack Exchange so he could spend more time with his family. On February 5, 2013, Atwood announced his new company, Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc. Its flagship product is an open source next-generation discussion platform called Discourse.

The Daktory operated in open defiance of New Zealand drug legislation prohibiting the cultivation, possession, sale and consumption of cannabis; its founder Dakta Green was jailed for 23 months for the operation of the warehouse. Members were called 'Daktas' and are registered under a pseudonym of their choice. They paid a monthly fee to join which allowed them access to The Daktory or they paid a $5 general entry charge. Patrons had to be 18 years of age or older. Once inside, members would openly smoke cannabis using any of the many paraphernalia provided. At various times cannabis was also openly grown in and sold from the Daktory. Nationwide branches of the Daktory were planned for all major New Zealand cities and other areas of strong demand for cannabis. History The Daktory evolved from a group of cannabis law reform supporters in Auckland, the home base of NORML New Zealand. Auckland 420 The founding members of the Daktory got to know each other through the short lived Auckland 420 sessions that took place in Albert Park from mid-2007 to mid-2008. The Auckland 420 sessions were established to show solidarity with the Dunedin 420 group that had been established in 2004.NORML News The Cannabus The group of activists centred on the Auckland 420 sessions were responsible for the genesis of Mary Jane the Cannabus, a rehabilitated old Bedford bus owned by NORML New Zealand that serves as a mobile cannabis law reform activism centre. As one of the core members of the Auckland group was moving back to Dunedin, a plan was hatched to take the Cannabus on a nationwide tour from Auckland to Dunedin once her rehabilitation was complete. The Cannabus tour took place from late March to early May 2008, visiting 42 towns and cities throughout New Zealand and having a high-profile public cannabis smoking session at 4:20pm in each town on each day of the tour. The bus was driven for the length of the tour by Dakta Green, Dakta Grower, and Dakta Fooz, who were joined for a few weeks, including two \\"smoke-in\\" protests at parliament, by NORML Communications Officer Danyl Strype. The tour was timed to arrive in Dunedin for Cannabis Awareness Week and J-Day, annual events put on by the Otago University NORML chapter.NORML News New Lynn After the tour a warehouse space in New Lynn, Waitakere was acquired to permanently store the Cannabus when it was not on the road. This space is located at 80 Delta Avenue, New Lynn, the current location of the Daktory. The factory is owned by Jacqueline & Brian Clarke and the Onehunga Trustee Company Limited.NORML News Media interest Dakta Green has appeared in the media numerous times promoting the Daktory, initially gaining notoriety as a candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party in the 2009 Mt.

He was the eldest son of, and is thought to have succeeded his father, Malcolm, in the years spanning 1360-1370\\\\. Clan tradition states that he was the most tyrannical of all MacLeod chiefs. His wife supposedly was as cruel as he was; she is said to have had two of her daughters buried alive in the dungeon of Dunvegan Castle when they attempted to leave the clan. Iain Ciar was killed in an ambush in about 1392. He was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, William Cleireach. Life According to the twentieth-century clan historian, R.C. MacLeod, Iain Ciar is estimated to have been born in the year 1330, or possibly later; he was the eldest child and succeeded his father, Malcolm, sometime between the years 1360 and 1370. The early nineteenth century Bannatyne manuscript states that he received a charter from Robert II, for the lands of Trotternish and all his other lands on Skye--although MacLeod noted that he could not find any evidence for the said charter. The manuscript states that Iain Ciar was said to have been \\"the most tyrannical and bloodthirsty despot, equally feared and hated by all his vassals, and by the members of his own family\\". It continues that he married the daughter of an Irish O'Neil chieftain and that she was just as cruel as her husband. For example, the manuscript tells that when she discovered that two of her daughters were about to escape her tyranny with their lovers (two MacQueen brothers from Roag), she had the brothers flogged to death, their bodies thrown into the sea, and her two daughters were buried alive within the dungeon of Dunvegan Castle. MacLeod's Maidens, Skye, where the wife and three illegitimate daughters of Iain Ciar were said to have perished The manuscript relates a story in which Iain Ciar was hunting deer with the leading men of his clan. The forest on Harris, in which they hunted, was owned in ancient times by Clan Vic Ghitthich (\\"the children of the Wolf\\") and still was partially possessed by the family, although they paid tribute to MacLeod. During the hunt, Iain Ciar expressed his anger that they had not come across the white stag that was known to live in the area; the MacLeod chief offered a large reward to whoever could discover the offender who had killed the animal. An enemy of the MacGhitthich chief put the blame on MacGhitthich and in consequence, Iain Ciar had MacGhitthich cruelly put to death by forcing the antlers of a large deer into his bowels. When the hunting party returned to Rodel, intending to set sail for Dunvegan, the vengeful MacGhitthiches attacked the MacLeods. Iain Ciar was struck by an arrow. His son, William Cleireach managed to rally his clan and fend off the attackers. Iain Ciar's wife, three of his illegitimate daughters, and other women, fled the hostilities in a galley. The ship was, however, blown out to sea and across The Minch, before it was dashed to pieces against rocks, which the manuscript describes as being called \\"the Maidens\\". The wounded Iain Ciar was taken to the church at Rodel, where he died that evening. His body was taken to Iona where it was buried. He was succeeded by his surviving son, William Cleireach. The late nineteenth-century historian A. MacKenzie stated that Iain Ciar died shortly after the ascension of Robert III; MacLeod thought that he was killed in the year 1392. Church of St Clement, Rodel, Harris, where tradition states the wounded Iain Ciar was taken before he died The Bannatyne manuscript states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early sixteenth century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod marker. The stone formed a matrix which at one time contained the brass inlay (tradition states that it was a silver inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring by . R. C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps Leod and five of his successors were buried beneath--however, in his opinion Iain Ciar was buried elsewhere. thumbThe choir of Iona Abbey; The stone said to represent a MacLeod is visible on the floor in the middle; the effigy on the left (north) is of a Mackinnon, the one on the right is a Mackenzie MacLeod stated that there was another MacLeod tombstone on Iona, which was supposed to have been the stone of a sixteenth-century MacLeod of Lewis. In spite of this, MacLeod speculated that this stone was in fact that of Iain Ciar; since, in his opinion, Iain Ciar was too wicked a man to have been buried in the family vault with his predecessors. MacLeod transcribed the stone and considered the Latin short-form to represent: \\"Here lies the body of the distinguished John Dominus M'Leoid\\", as well as the date, \\"1414\\". He also noted that the stone bears a coat of arms and described it as containing a lymphad, below which were four animals standing erect. The two animals on the left were facing one another and MacLeod thought they could be lions. The third animal he considered to be a stag; the fourth MacLeod could not identify, though he supposed it could represent some heraldic device from his wife, who was of the Irish O'Neil dynasty. Issue According to the Bannatyne manuscript, Iain Ciar and his O'Neil wife had two sons, four daughters. It also records that he had three illegitimate daughters who were killed with his wife. The eldest son, Malcolm, was killed at a feast on Lewis where he intended to wed the daughter of his kinsman. A fight broke out during the feast, however, and both he and his kinsman were slain. In consequence, bitterness was felt between the two branches--Sìol Torcaill and Sìol Tormoid--for some time afterward. Iain Ciar's second son, William, was intended to be trained for the church, and was known as \\"a Cleireach\\", the clerk. He ended up succeeding his father. The manuscript states that one of Iain Ciar's daughters married Lachlan MacLean of Duart and another married Cameron of Locheil--both had issue. Two were murdered, as noted above, before marriage.

The stream originates on Coyote Ridge and flows to the bay at the south end of Bothin Marsh. History The Richardson Bay watershed is located on the aboriginal lands of the Coast Miwok. Spanish colonization began in neighboring Sausalito, California, in 1775, when Juan de Ayala sailed the first ship (the San Carlos) into San Francisco Bay. These explorers named the area Saucelito (“little willows”) after the vegetation spotted from shipboard. When the Mission San Rafael Arcángel, established in 1817, was secularized by the Mexican government in 1834, the mission lands were granted to prominent Californios as ranchos. The Rancho Corte Madera del Presidio (literally, “place where wood is cut for the Presidio”) included a sawmill for processing redwood trees, cattle and horse ranches, a brickyard, and a stone quarry. Sausalito became an important ferry port, connecting Marin to San Francisco. The railroad brought supplies from the north to be shipped across San Francisco Bay. Habitat and ecology Historically, Coyote Creek hosted California golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) whose beaver dams likely played a role in removing sediment and improving over-summering habitat for steelhead and salmon smolt.

This was the first Rose Bowl appearance by the Huskies since 1944 and the first appearance by the Badgers since 1953. This was the first time these two football programs met on the field. The Washington Huskies defeated the Wisconsin Badgers, 44-8. The face value of a game ticket was six dollars. Teams=Washington Huskies The Washington Huskies were the first conference champions of the newly-formed Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), commonly referred to as the \\"Big Five\\" at the time (and now as the Pac-12). The conference formed in the wake of the \\"pay for play\\" scandal and collapse of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) after the 1958 season. As a result of the demise of the PCC, the Rose Bowl had no contractual agreement with either the Big Five or Big Ten to send their champions to the game: both teams received \\"at-large\\" invitations and accepted. Washington, USC, and UCLA all finished with 3–1 conference records. Washington had defeated UCLA, which had defeated USC, which had defeated Washington. The USC loss was the only one for Washington, and the Huskies had the best record in the AAWU. Washington entered the game as the West representative, the first champions of the newly-formed AAWU conference. They were led by quarterback Bob Schloredt, a 20-year-old junior who \\"conspicuously lack[ed] his trade's traditional egotism,\\" stating \\"I consider myself just adequate.\\" Remarkably, he was also 90% blind in his left eye. Wisconsin Badgers Wisconsin, the Big Ten Conference champion, had a 7-2 regular season record, with losses to Purdue and Illinois. Despite the similarity in the poll rankings, Wisconsin entered the game as a 6½-point favorite, due in part to recent dominance of the Big Ten in recent Rose Bowl games, winning twelve of thirteen.

It survived for just over a century from when the line opened in 1880 until it was closed in 1981.  History = Facilities  Like most of the Wairarapa stations as far north as Masterton, Dalefield opened along with the line between Woodside and Masterton on 1 November 1880. Several months after the opening of the Greytown Branch in May 1880, a shelter shed had been constructed at Dalefield which, along with a short loop siding, comprised the few amenities that were provided there. Concerns about the possibility of stock straying along the line, brought about by the recent decking of the bridge south of the station yard in 1910 for shunting purposes, led to a request for the original road alignment through the station, which had earlier been moved north in 1895, to be restored. As the road crossed both the main line and the loop siding, access through the station yard on the road was controlled by station gates which were frequently being left open, making it possible for stock to escape. Various remedies were suggested and in 1912 the Wairarapa South County Council submitted a proposal to the Railways Department which called for the loop siding to be shortened and cattle stops to be installed so passage along the road could be permitted without the need for gates. A meeting between the council and the department was arranged to discuss possible modifications. The council expressed its concern about the existing road crossing which, for example, caused problems when wagons were left in the siding thus blocking access through the yard. As objections had been raised over the idea of shortening the loop it was suggested that the loop instead be extended northwards which would also require the moving of the platform and shelter north also. Local settlers also met with the Railways Department in 1912 and expressed their concerns about access to the platform. Outward consignments, such as cheese, had to be carried across the siding to the platform and inward goods had to be similarly transferred from the platform to carts. A request was made for the construction of a cart dock and an approach road to the back of the platform, on the eastern side of the main line. This request was later approved on 27 November 1912. By 1914 none of the proposed improvements had been made as a decision on whether or not to move the station northwards was still pending. It was finally decided to not proceed with moving the station northwards and a request for the construction of the approach road and cart dock was put in hand. Only two years later, in conjunction with the council, the Railways Department embarked on a reorganisation of the station yard including modification of the loop siding and moving the platform and station building. The construction of a loading bank was requested in 1930 when local farmers complained that their previous requests for improved loading facilities had been ignored and that the requirement for them to drive their stock to the nearest such facilities at Carterton was unreasonable. A local racing enthusiast also pointed out that a loading bank at Dalefield would be most useful to him in his business of training race horses. A loading bank the length of a single wagon was thought sufficient to meet requirements. Approval for the construction of the loading bank was given on 28 April 1930 and it was noted that completion was required in time for the upcoming Winter Show in Wellington and the Carterton Show. The loading bank was built with a timber front, ramped at both ends to a grade of 1 in 5, to a height of and long, and was completed on 29 May 1930. The turnouts for the loop siding came due for renewal in 1959 and it was suggested that perhaps the siding should be closed altogether. It was noted that the dairy company, which had been the main user of the siding, was planning to switch production to casein which would only require irregular shipments. The District Traffic Manager advised that the traffic for the siding was still such that the siding could not be closed and it was therefore decided to proceed with the renewal of the turnouts.  Operations  Dalefield dairy factory. Dalefield was always considered to be a small station but at various times throughout its history served significant customers or sources of traffic such as an early sawmill in the vicinity and the nearby dairy factory. Trains were also crossed there in the days before signalling arrangements were standardised but this practice was discontinued when more modern signal systems were introduced at the larger stations. Services through Dalefield started with two return weekday mixed trains, an arrangement that lasted many decades. No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains. As was typically the case for flag stations, trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers and wagons if required to do so. The Wairarapa Line was completed to its northern terminus at Woodville in 1897 and this enabled the Railways Department to introduce the Napier Mail to the Wairarapa Line. This train had earlier run as the Napier Express via the Wellington and Manawatu Railway and the Manawatu Gorge. This arrangement lasted until 1909 when the Napier Mail once again became the Napier Express and reverted to its original route. Thereafter the primary passenger service through the Wairarapa was the Wairarapa Mail which was essentially the Wellington to Woodville portion of the old Napier Mail. From 1936 when the NZR RM class Wairarapa-type railcars were introduced passengers from Dalefield had a much faster service to points both north and south. The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday – Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage. It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948. Several years later the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars, and ushering in the era of the twin-set railcars. The 1959 railcar timetable lists Dalefield as a \\"stops if required\\" station for both northbound and southbound services. The station remained open to both passenger and freight traffic until its closure on 1 February 1981.Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand  Today  Nothing remains of the station’s facilities at the site. The station building, platform, loading bank, and siding have all been removed.

The Commission was established in 1996 as an independent body to investigate complaints, facilitate mediation and take legal action against offenders.  History = Background  The Hong Kong government has had a history of opposing anti-discrimination legislation. When the United Kingdom ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1986, the effect of CEDAW was extended to other British dependent territories. However, the Hong Kong government requested that CEDAW to not be extended to Hong Kong until it could assess its effect, claiming that the ratification of CEDAW might lead to \\"significant economic and social consequences\\". Specifically, the government believed that CEDAW and anti-discrimination legislation would affect Hong Kong's laissez- faire market and traditional Chinese customs that treat men and women differently. In the 1990s, the Hong Kong government was increasingly pressured to address equality and human rights. The 1991 legislative election produced Hong Kong's first directly elected Legislative Councillors. During the election, women's groups pressured candidates into acknowledging discrimination against women. As a result, the 1991 Legislative Council asserted more pressure on the executive than its predecessors. In November 1991, Legislative Councillor Emily Lau helped establish an ad-hoc group in the Legislative Council to study women's issues. In March 1992, an inter- departmental working group on sex discrimination was established to advise the government on whether to extend CEDAW to Hong Kong. On 16 December 1992, Lau introduced a bill that called on the Hong Kong government to support the extension of CEDAW. The bill was opposed by the government, but nonetheless passed after all but the three ex-officio members voted in its favour. Emily Lau at a demonstration in 2014. The Hong Kong government did not act on the bill immediately and maintained that the public must first be consulted. After nine months of preparation, it issued the \\"Green Paper on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men\\" in August 1993. According to Carole Petersen, discrimination against women was understated in the green paper by the government. By the end of the public consultation on the green paper, Secretary for Home Affairs Michael Suen admitted that \\"[it] would be difficult for [the government] to come up with credible arguments not to extend CEDAW\\".  Establishment  Anna Wu, then an appointed Legislative Councillor, tabled the Equal Opportunities Bill 1994 before the legislature, during a period leading up to the handover of Hong Kong which Wu believed to have given a window of opportunity for expanding equality rights. The bill sought to prohibit discrimination on a number of grounds, including sex, marital status, pregnancy, sexuality, race, age, disability, and political and religious conviction. As a private members' bill not affecting government revenue, the Equal Opportunities Bill did not require government consent to be tabled. Wu also proposed the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission Bill, which would create a statutory body for equality and a tribunal to adjudicate claims under the Equal Opportunities Bill. The bill was rejected by Governor Chris Patten, as the government was going to present a similar bill establishing an equality commission and to legislate against discrimination on the grounds of sex, disability and family status.

It aims to eliminate discrimination, to promote equal opportunities and to receive complaints and investigate alleged cases of discrimination. Where cases of potential discrimination is identified, the EOC is empowered to provide legal assistance (including representation in court) to plaintiffs. It also conducts research and offers public educational programmes to promote equal opportunities. Advertisement of the EOC on a tram.

It was passed shortly following an inquiry by the Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion. The legislation established the legal framework for abortion in New Zealand; with abortions being allowed provided the procedure was approved by two certifying consultants and that the circumstances met the criteria of the Crimes Act 1961. In March 2020, several of its provisions were amended by the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, which eased access to abortion and eliminated most of the criteria established by the Crimes Act 1961. Legislative features=1977 legislation The Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act 1977 regulated the supply of contraceptives to young people, the conditions that sterilisations could be undertaken, and the circumstances under which abortions could be authorised. The legislation decriminalised abortions for pregnancies of less than 20 weeks on the condition that it was authorised by two certifying consultants and that it met the following criteria under Sections 182–187A of the Crimes Act 1961 and two amendments passed in December 1977 and July 1978: *to save the life of the woman (even if after 20 weeks); *to preserve the physical health of the woman; *to preserve the mental health of the woman; *foetal impairment; and *in cases of incest Other factors which may be taken into account were: *extremes of age; and *sexual violation (previously rape) After 20 weeks gestation, the grounds for abortion were: *to save the life of the mother; *to prevent serious permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the mother. The CS&A; Act also established an Abortion Supervisory Committee for regulating and licensing certifying consultants. It also made it illegal for health employers to deny employment to medical practitioners on the basis of their conscientious objection to abortion. 2020 amendments The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 replaces Sections 10 to 46 of the CS&A; Act 1977 with Sections 10–14 and Sections 19–21. While Sections 15 to 17 created safe areas around abortion service providers, these clauses were eliminated from the final version of the law. The amended bill also abolishes the Abortion Supervisory Committee and delegates its former responsibilities to the Minister of Health and the Director-General of Health. The amended clauses are: *Section 10: A health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant. *Section 11: After 20 weeks, a health practitioner can only provide abortion services to a woman if it is deemed \\"clinically appropriate\\" and if they consult at least one other qualified practitioner. *Section 13: A health practitioner must advise a woman of the availability of counselling services if the woman seeks advice on whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy; advises the health practitioner of her intention to terminate the pregnancy; or has terminated pregnancy. *Section 14: A health practitioner cannot force a woman to seek counselling as a condition for procuring an abortion. *Section 19: A health practitioner with a conscientious objection to abortion must inform the patient and provide them with information on accessing alternative abortion providers. *Section 20: Employer providing certain services must accommodate conscientious objection of applicant or employee unless it would cause unreasonable disruption. Abortion is regulated by the Ministry of Health and the Director-General of Health, which oversee the collection and publication of information relating to abortion services and providers. Section 20F prohibits abortion for the sole purpose of sex selection. *Section 21: The Governor-General has the authority to direct the Director-General of Health to collection. History In response to growing calls for the decriminalisation of abortion in New Zealand during the 1960s and 1970s, the New Zealand Parliament established a Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion in 1975 to consider abortion and these other issues. Based on the Royal Commission's recommendations, Parliament passed the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977, which established the regulatory framework for abortion. Women seeking abortion had to see their doctor and two medical consultants, who would assess the mental and physical grounds for carrying out an abortion under the criteria of the Crimes Act 1961. A surgeon would be needed to perform an abortion and counselling was also made available to women seeking an abortion. The CS&A; Act also established an Abortion Supervisory Committee to regulate the consultation process and required district health boards to fund abortion services. Feminists and abortion-rights groups considered the CS&A; Act's legal framework too strict, leading the Third National Government to amend the Crime Act. Subsequent amendments to the Crimes Act 1961 in 1977 and 1978 permitted abortion within 20 weeks on mental and physical health grounds; abortion after 20 weeks for the purpose of saving the mother's life, physical, and mental health; foetal abnormality within the first 20 weeks; and incest. In 1986, the Fourth Labour Government amended the Crimes Act to account for the extremes of age and sexual violation as mitigating grounds for abortion. Over the next three decades, politicians and abortion-rights groups lobbied for amending the CS&A; Act to ease the criteria for abortions. In late March 2020, the Sixth Labour Government passed the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, which replaced Sections 10 to 46 of the CS&A; Act with new clauses allowing women to seek abortion in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy; and only requiring consultations with two health practitioners after 20 weeks.

She was editor of the Advocate, the state's largest African-American newspaper. She was also co-founder and vice president of the Portland, Oregon chapter of the NAACP.  Early life  Cannady was born Beatrice Hulon Morrow in Littig, Texas in 1890. She was the second-oldest daughter of George Morrow and Mary Francis Carter Morrow, farmers who raised their children to value education. They had twelve surviving children; eleven daughters and one son. Morrow enjoyed singing from an early age. As a young woman, she moved to Chicago to study music with conductor David Clippinger. Career and civil rights  thumb In June of 1912, Beatrice Morrow married Edward Daniel Cannady. He was the co-founder of The Advocate, one of Portland, Oregon's first black-owned newspapers. The two had written to each other while Morrow was living in Chicago. Upon moving to Portland, Cannady became associate editor of The Advocate. Her work through the newspaper drew attention to racial violence during the early 1920s and prompted a statement from Governor Ben W. Olcott decrying the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, which was spreading through Oregon at the time. In addition to her editorial work, Cannady helped to establish the Portland chapter of the NAACP in 1913. This organization marked the first such branch of the organization formed west of the Mississippi River and continues to actively participate in the Portland community. Acting as the chapter's secretary, Cannady worked with the group to remove racist, exclusionary language from Oregon's constitution, a mission which succeeded in 1926 and 1927 when the changes were ratified. Cannady also led protests against Ku Klux Klan propaganda film The Birth of a Nation. Cannady graduated from Northwestern College of Law in 1922, making her the first black woman to graduate from law school in Oregon. She went on to become the first black woman to practice law in Oregon and the first black woman to run for state representative. Cannady successfully advocated for the passage of civil rights bills by the Oregon state legislature. Her efforts helped integrate public schools in Longview, Washington and Vernonia, Oregon. In 1927, Cannady represented Oregon at the 4th annual Pan-African Congress in New York City.  Personal life  Cannady had two sons, George Cannady and Ivan Caldwell Cannady. She divorced Edward Cannady in 1930. A year later, she married Yancy Jerome Franklin, a typist at The Advocate. Cannady and Franklin divorced in 1936. Cannady left Oregon in about 1938 and moved to Los Angeles, California where she married Reuben Taylor. She worked for the Precinct Reporter, a Southern California newspaper founded in 1965 that served the black community. Legacy  Cannady paved the way for the second generation of civil rights activists in Oregon with her nearly 25-year fight as a leading activist. To honor her history in the area, a new school in the North Clackamas School District bears her name as the Beatrice Morrow Cannady Elementary School. An affordable housing project in North Portland will be named the Beatrice Morrow Building in her honor.

Construction techniques The houses of the Cucuteni- Trypillia settlements were constructed in several general ways: * Wattle-and- daub homes. * Log houses called ploshchadki (). * Semi-underground homes called bordei. Some Cucuteni-Trypillia homes were two storeys tall, and evidence shows that the members of this culture sometimes decorated the outsides of their homes with many of the same complex red-ochre swirling designs that are to be found on their pottery. Most houses had thatched roofs and wooden floors covered with clay. Archaeologists have identified two types of house framing found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. One type, somewhat resembling the post and beam style, used evenly distributed fork-shaped log pillars that were partially sunk vertically into the ground so that the fork was located at the top and supported the roof beams above. The other type of framing used vertical beams measuring , or greater, which rested on horizontal ground-sill foundational timbers that were in turn fixed in place on top of the soil. Most of the walls were built in the wattle-and-daub style. The construction of these houses first started by erecting the framework of larger timbers in place (photo 1), which would take the weight of the structure, and then the space between these timbers would be filled in with a \\"wattle\\" made of pliable smaller branches and vines woven together to form a thin twiggy latticed net which was then affixed to the sturdy timbers (photo 2). Onto this wattle framework the \\"daub\\" would be applied made of mostly dampened clay soil although sometimes mixed with small bits of straw and/or animal dung to help keep its structural integrity (photo 3). The daub had to be applied with some force against the wattle in order for it to partially push through the twiggy framework, to which it would stick. Sometimes there would only be a single layer of wattle, and at other times two wattle layers would be used; one for the interior and another for the exterior of the wall. Daub was applied on both sides of the wall, inside and out (photo 4), creating a finished wall that was usually about thick. Once applied it was smoothed before drying to create an air- and water-tight barrier against the elements (photo 5). After the daub was fully dried, it was usually painted with lime to prevent infestations of pests.(note: the photographic examples used in this paragraph were taken from the web page \\"Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house\\", hosted by The Archaeological Park Cucuteni, see \\"External Links\\" at bottom of this article) Sometimes the walls were made of horizontally laid timbers (similar to log houses) that were then covered with clay daub. Some examples have been found where the horizontal timbers were in turn covered with a wattle-and-daub layer. At other times the horizontal timbers would be covered with a layer of primitively finished lumber. There was no standard practice in building walls there during Neolithic times; sometimes, even in the same house, walls would be constructed with horizontal timbers while others would be covered with finished lumber or wattle-and-daub. This type of horizontal log construction found in Cucuteni-Trypillia houses is called ploshchadki in Russian (). Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were roofed with live turf or thatched reeds. The shape of the house was usually rectangular but some were laid out in an \\"L\\" shape. Some of the houses were divided into separate rooms while others contained a semi-open functional space, or atrium. Many of the Cucuteni- Trypillia houses were two stories high.

Unlike surface dwellings characterized by walls with right angles and rectangular shapes the bordei houses were characterized by elliptical shapes. These houses would typically have a wooden floor that was about below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level. Images of bordei homes may be seen at the Romanian Art Zone page File:CucuteniNeolithicChair.JPGA clay model of a figurine in a chair File:CucuteniGoddessonthechair.JPGA clay Precucuteni Goddess and chair File:CucuteniGoddesonthestoove.JPGClay models found at a Cucuteni-Trypillian site showing figurines sitting on a couch-like piece of furniture House interior Clay Model of house interior with two fireplaces Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were arranged by locating the front door opposite from where the fireplace sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known would be used for clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals. The number of fireplaces found within each house varied from just one (which was the most common) to several, or even none. Each of the fireplaces found in houses that had more than one would have its own specific use such as one for cooking, one for firing ceramics, etc. Most Cucuteni-Trypillia fireplaces were a type of open fire pit and were usually constructed on the floor by laying down a bed of clay mixed with broken pottery shards and then covering this with a smooth clay-plastered surface. It is assumed that furniture was extensively used however, due to the climate of this region, wood does not preserve well here. However some of the many miniature clay figurines found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites were placed sitting or reclining on different pieces of furniture, some of which resemble sofas, chairs, or even ovens. There is also some evidence of furniture being incorporated into the structure of the walls of houses by using woven branches covered with clay.

It was Wisconsin's first bowl game and the first Rose Bowl appearance for the Trojans in five years. It is also the first meeting of the two football programs. Teams=Wisconsin Badgers UW Marching Band heading to the Rose Bowl Wisconsin was the co-champion of the Big Ten Conference with Purdue, whom they did not play, and entered the Rose Bowl with a 6–2–1 record (4–1–1 in conference). The Badgers' non-conference loss was to UCLA, the Big Ten loss was at Ohio State, and they tied Minnesota in their season-ending rivalry game. This was the program's first bowl game appearance. USC Trojans The USC Trojans entered the game as the Pacific Coast Conference champions, with a 6–0 record in conference play. Their sole loss was against Notre Dame in their season-ending rivalry game. Aftermath This was the first win by a Pacific Coast team over a Big Ten team since the Rose Bowl began its exclusive contract to pair the champions of these two conferences in 1946 (beginning with the 1947 Rose Bowl). It was only the second time in Rose Bowl history that the PCC defeated the Big Ten, the first was 32 years earlier in January 1921, when California defeated Ohio State. This game featured the fewest points scored in a Rose Bowl since the 0-0 tie in 1922. As of 2020, this game still stands as the second-fewest points ever scored in a Rose Bowl, and the fewest scored since the Rose Bowl started pairing the Big Ten and West (PCC/AAWU) champions for the game. The next time these two teams met in a Rose Bowl (1963), they combined to break the record for the most points ever scored in the game. USC quarterback Rudy Bukich was named the Player of the Game. Future Heisman Trophy winner, Wisconsin running back/linebacker Alan Ameche, finished the game with 133 rushing yards on 28 carries. Bukich and Ameche have subsequently been inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame.

The Handbook of Organizational Consulting PsychologyLowman, R.L. (Ed.). (2002). Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. provides an overview of specific areas of study and application within the field. The major journal in the field is Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research. Consulting psychologists typically work in business or non-profit organizations, in consulting firms or in private practice. Consulting psychologists are typically professionally licensed as psychologists. Defining consulting psychology The American Psychological Association defines the fields as: > \\"Consulting psychology shall be defined as the function of applying and > extending the specialized knowledge of a psychologist through the process of > consultation to problems involving human behavior in various areas. A > consulting psychologist shall be defined as a psychologist who provides > specialized technical assistance to individuals or organizations in regard > to the psychological aspects of their work. Such assistance is advisory in > nature and the consultant has no direct responsibility for its acceptance. > Consulting psychologists may have as clients individuals, institutions, > agencies, corporations or other kinds of organization.\\"APA Division 13, 1999 Consultation should help individuals and organizations \\"become more efficient and effective.\\"Former Div. 13 Chair DeWayne Kurpius, 1978 Models of consultation=Generic The generic model encompasses all kinds of consulting, starting with Entry, moving through Diagnosis and Implementation and ending with an explicit Disengagement.Caplan, G. (1970). Theory and practice of mental health consultation. New York: Basic Books.; Caplan, G. & Caplan, R.B. (1993). Mental health consultation and collaboration. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Client-centered This approach focuses on an individual client (recipient of service) and helps service providers better help that client. The consultant functions assesses the client, makes a diagnosis and recommends changes to the consultee, typically a teacher, physician or other care providers. Consultee-centered This relationship focuses on the consultee rather than a particular client, helping build new skills via training and/or supervision. The consultant typically does not meet clients directly. Consultees seek consultation to increase knowledge, skills, confidence, and/or objectivity. Consultee-centered administrative consultation In some cases, the focus is on administrative rather than professional staff. Such relationships are typically longer term.  Behavioral consultation model/behavioral-operant  In this model, the consultant is an authority figure who assumes primary responsibility for the relationship.Bergan, J.R. & Kratochwill, T.R. (1990) Behavioral Consultation and Therapy. New York, NY: Springer. The focus is on problem-solving more than skills development or a particular client. Organization consultation This model employs systems theory to improve productivity or to streamline the relationship between an organization and its environment. Statistical consultation A model that focuses on having statistical consultants to research empirical evidence and sophisticated analysis through consulting test and certified projects.Cole, J. & Dang, J.(2010) Measurement, Monte Carlo, and music: Why doctorates in psychology and other applied fields make desirable consultants in statistics. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,4–11. Litigation and risk management A model used by behavioral scientists who works in jury thought and decision making processes. They are usually reserved to help attorneys and insurance companies to evaluate the risks of lawsuits and/or the application of settlement.Finkelman, J. M. (2010) Litigation consulting: Expanding beyond jury selection to trial strategy and tactics. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62, 12–20 Roles Consulting psychology encompasses diverse roles including individual assessment, individual and group process consultation, organizational development, education/training, employee selection/appraisal, research and evaluation test construction, executive/manager coaching, change management, expert technical support Professional education The American Psychological Association publishes professional training guidelines for consulting psychologists.Guidelines for education and training at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels in consulting psychology/Organizational consulting psychology (2007). American Psychologist, 62, 980–92. Master's programs are available under varying program names (e.g., business psychology). Some psychologists come to the field from areas such as clinical psychology, counseling psychology, or industrial and organizational psychology. Consultation in community psychology It is often critical to build community relationships to understand the context and enable the collection of appropriate data to supporting the consulting relationship. Strong relationships can increase trust between consultants and clients, leading to more effective interventions. Urie Bronfenbrenner's model of ecological systems theory is a framework for navigating the challenges of consulting in community psychology. Cultural sensitivity Consulting psychology can involve providers in communities unlike their own. Success requires sensitivity to cultural variation, including recognition of the consultant's own cultural bias and/or ethnocentrism. This is further complicated by potential differences between the background of the consultee and client. In this context, \\"culture\\" involves client's/consultee's religious, cultural and family background and value system. Cultural differences can involve communication styles, attitudes towards conflict, approaches to completing tasks, decision-making and attitudes towards disclosure. Notable consulting psychologists Consulting psychologists who have helped to develop the field include Clayton Alderfer, Chris Argyris, Elliott Jaques, Harry Levinson, and Edgar Schein. More recent authors include Arthur Freedman, Dale Fuqua, Richard Kilburg, Rodney L. Lowman, Jody Newman, Ann O'Roark, David Peterson, Sharon Robinson-Kurpius, Peter Sorensen, and Len Sperry. Society of Consulting Psychology The field's professional association is the Society of Consulting Psychology, Division 13 of the American Psychological Association (APA). The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Division 14 of the APA, is another professional association of which many consulting psychologists are members. The American Board of Professional Psychology certifies participants. Ethical issues Consultants face different ethical questions than clinicians:Fanibanda, D.K. (1976). Ethical issues of mental health consultation. Professional Psychology, 7, 547–52. * What degree of responsibility does the consultant take for a consultee's behavior and client outcomes? * To what extent and over what period is the consultee dependent on the consultant? * How is the consultant's responsibility for resolving conflicts with and among other participants? * What are acceptable motivations for the consultant to offer consulting services? * How are financial arrangements handled? * What is the proper oversight for consulting relationships? * What are the consultant's responsibilities for maintaining confidentiality? Consulting relationships differ from traditional counseling and psychotherapeutic relationships in fundamental ways that require consideration in evaluating ethical questions. As of 2012, formal ethical guidelines specific to the discipline are not available. Existing codes of ethics for the helping professions provide limited guidance for consultation practice.Newman, J.L. (1993). Ethical Issues in Consultation. Journal of Couunseling and Development, 72, 148–56. Ethical issues are inevitably complicated by the fact that consulting relationships involve three parties: the consultant, the consultee, and the consultee's client system. Confidentiality depends on the consultant and on the cooperative efforts of perhaps many organizational members. Variable levels of participation means attention to providing only appropriate access to information. Managing information access and confidentiality require negotiation.Newman, J.L. & Robinson, S.E. (1991). In the best interests of the consultee: Ethical issues in consultation. Consulting Psychology Bulletin, 43, 23–29. Clients' right to informed consent must be maintained in the presence of a consulting relationship. This right is complicated by the corresponding rights of consultees, including the right not to accept consultation. Power is typically distributed unequally among participants in the consultation process. Power differentials may be real or perceived. Those with greater power must take responsibility for its use and impact. Consultants with preexisting personal or professional relationships with participants in the consultation must take care that such relationships do not comprise the process.

Early life and career Tansel graduated from Davutpaşa junior high school and Pertevniyal high school in İstanbul. He took up teaching as a profession as early as 1938 while studying at the Department of the Turkish Language and Literature of the Faculty of Literature at the University of İstanbul and gave it up in 1969 when he retired for health reasons. He taught and held administrative positions in the junior high schools and high schools in Mardin, Akhisar, Eskişehir (Çifteler Village Institute), Amasya and Konya. He was a member of the Turkish Writers’ Union and honorary member of the Literary Society. Writing career His early poems employing rhyme and rhythm were published in the periodicals Servetifünun and Varlık and his first article appeared in Halk Bilgisi Haberleri (1937). After 1940 he was seen to turn to free verse and was noted among Turkish poets of the 1940s generation. He gained recognition with the poems and articles published in numerous literary periodicals such as Varlık, Aydınlık, Yelken, Yeditepe, Kaynak, Dost, Güney, Türk Sanatı, Kıyı, Türk Dili. In his poems where he treated themes of humanism, love, struggle for peace and freedom, equality and socialism he arrived at a plain style of poetry. Alongside poetry, Tansel was the scholar of Turkish folk tales which he had recorded during 1942-1948 in the province of Amasya. He made the highest contribution of over forty types of Turkish folk tales, to the Typen Türkischer Volksmarchen catalog prepared by professors Pertev Naili Boratav and Wolfram Eberhard. With the mastery and meticulousness derived from his poetic skill, he formed his own unique, fluent narrative style in writing down those tales for children. He was the first author to receive the Children’s Literature Award in 1977 given by the Turkish Linguistics Society for his two volume collection of folk tale books titled “Al’lı ile Fırfırı”. His poems were composed to music by the American composer Prof. Bruce Reiprich. And recorded live on a CD titled Salkım Söğüt, or The Weeping Willow. On the first anniversary of his death in 1995, his friends had a book The Mythical Bird with Three Wings: Oğuz Tansel (Üç Kanatlı Masal Kuşu: Oğuz Tansel) published for him. Death and after Following his death, his family donated Tansel’s library to the Department of Turkish Language of the Middle East Technical University in Ankara to give rise to the Oğuz Tansel- Kalbiye Tansel Library. His family together with Ankara Aydınlığı Girişimi instituted a poetry award to commemorate him. His family together with Ankara Aydınlığı Girişimi, Folklor/ Edebiyat Dergisi and Troya Folklor Dernegi also instituted a folkore award to commemorate his achievements in folklore. These awards are given one year to a work of poetry and the following year to a work of folklore.

Its powers and responsibilities vary greatly from country to country, but generally cover the setting of rules as well as enforcing them for financial intermediaries and stock exchanges. History As long as there have been securities there have been regulations. However, in the early days this consisted primarily of self-regulated groups or societies. External government regulation has primarily been driven by financial crises or scandals. As early as the 13th century the king Edward I of England decreed that brokers should be licensed after he was forced to go to local money brokers that give much less favorable terms then his Italian brokers after the start of the Anglo- French war. In 1720 the British Parliament passed the Bubble Act which had specific regulations for securities. However the motive of this act was more to support the ‘South Sea bubble’ than protect consumers. However this was the first time that prospectuses and disclosure in the modern sense were used. There was widespread distrust of brokers as the scams collapsed. In the United States, although Massachusetts required the registration of railroad securities as early as 1852, and other states passed laws relating to securities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the real push for securities regulation came from the Midwestern and far western states. After common feeling that investors in these areas of the country were being victimized by capitalists in the east. However it was the failure of the Blue sky law and the 1930 financial crisis and Great Depression that led the United States government to pass legislation in 1934 to strengthen securities law and for the first time create a separate agency the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the early 1980s as many countries deregulated their financial markets, they created specific government agencies to police the securities markets and stock exchanges so as to separate regulation from operation of financial markets. Some countries like the UK, created one large agency that covered all financial products. However, some countries use a different model where there are separate agencies for different financial products. Typically, securities, banking and insurance are split, but there may also be separate agencies for futures, options and commodities. With the advent of derivatives and new financial products it has not always been easy to see who has jurisdiction and what their responsibilities are. A fact, that some unscrupulous financial companies have used to their advantage to skirt existing regulation. The Financial crisis of 2007–2010 has seen much criticism of the securities regulators for failing to stop abuses of markets and their slowness in responding to the crisis and having suffered regulatory capture. Structure Most securities commissions are semi-independent government organisations that have a board of commissioners, usually appointed by the government of the country. They are often fully or partially funded by the organisations that are regulated through charges such as registration and licensing fees. Naming There is no common name for securities commission or financial regulatory agency in each country. Naming has become more complicated as some governments have consolidated or merged organisations and given them a wider remit. They sometimes contain the term securities and commission. Such as the Securities and Exchange Commission of the US or Securities and Futures Commission (Hong Kong). A number also have names based on Financial Authority, such as the Financial Services Authority of the UK or Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden) or variations such as the Financial Services Agency (Japan). Common features Most securities commissions have a mandate to protect consumers, make sure there is an orderly and stable financial market and that brokers and participants behave fairly with clients and each other. Often local stock exchanges as well as brokers are covered by the commission. International cooperation Most financial regulators are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an organisation that helps securities commissions cooperate. The main way that securities commission cooperate is through the IOSCO Memorandum of Understanding, or through bilateral agreements between securities commissions. Within the European Union there is the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) which is advisory body for the European Commission which attempts to coordinate rules between EU securities commissions.

Geeben (née Colleen; March 31, 1908 - January 11, 2010) was the oldest mayor in the United States. She served as the second mayor of Ocean Breeze Park, Florida from 2001-10. Geeben began her public service work on the Ocean Breeze Town Council in 1960. She became the council's president in 1976 and served in that capacity for thirty-one years. In 2001, after the death of Ruth Hoke, the first mayor and widow of Gene Hoke, son of the town founders, Harry and Queena Hoke, Geeben was chosen to be the next mayor. She served as mayor for the next nine years, running unopposed in the 2002 and 2004 mayoral elections. Geeben died on January 11, 2010, after missing the town meeting because she felt ill. Political career Geeben started serving on the Ocean Breeze Town Council in 1960. Beginning in 1976, Geeben served as council president of Ocean Breeze Park, Florida, for thirty-one years. In 2001, after the death of Mayor Ruth Hoke, widow of the Gene Hoke, Geeben was selected to be the next mayor. In the 2002 and 2004 mayoral election, no one ran against her. When she was ninety-four years old, Geeben saved Jansen Beach Christian Church from closing down. At the time, the church lacked a minister and had four parishioners remaining. Geeben's efforts revived the church, enabling it to retain a pastor and increase church membership to 100 people. In 2004, NBC ran a segment about Geeben after filming her for a day. In 2008, Geeben counseled her constituents when they were afraid that they would be forced to move. The people's homes were located in a park that was going to be sold. In March of that year, Geeben helped mediate a deal that enabled the forty-six acres of residential area in the park to be bought for $26 million. Known as \\"Mayor Dorothy\\", Geeben characterized her role on the council as being ceremonial. She affixed her signature to checks as well participated in council meetings. Personal life Dorothy P. Colleen was born on March 31, 1908, in Mondovi, Wisconsin. During her childhood, she contracted polio but did not let the disease hinder her. She graduated from Marion High School, in Marion, Iowa, where she married Cornelius \\"Neal\\" Bunting, an electrician. They founded Bunting Electric, with her working as the bookkeeper. In 1952, she moved to Ocean Breeze Park, Florida, where she and her husband retired and purchased a mobile home. After her first husband's death, she married Albert Geeben in 1963, but he died less than two years later. As mayor, Geeben drove herself around in a 1983 Mercury Marquis. Every Sunday, she drove the few blocks north to the Jensen Beach Christian Church, where she was the treasurer and organist. Every week, she played bingo, and occasionally, she would go to the hair salon. Geeben balanced her bills through a typewriter and adding machine, just as she did in the 1920s. Geeben revealed that her secret to long life was always to be busy. She said, \\"I have a good time. I'm on the go a lot. I guess that's half the battle.\\" She received her exercise through a pedalling machine, which she used to invigorate her knees.

The response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake included national governments, charitable and for-profit organizations from around the world which began coordinating humanitarian aid designed to help the Haitian people. Some countries arranged to send relief and rescue workers and humanitarian supplies directly to the earthquake damage zones, while others sought to organize national fund raising to provide monetary support for the nonprofit groups working directly in Haiti. OCHA coordinates and tracks this on a daily basis.\\"Haiti earthquake aid pledged by country\\", The Guardian, 14 January 2010. The information is disseminated through the UN news and information portal, ReliefWeb. As of September 5, 2013, ReliefWeb have reported a total relief funding of $3.5 billion given (and a further $1 billion pledged but not given). A number of countries sent large contingents of disaster relief, medical staff, technicians for reconstruction and security personnel. Notably, the governments of the United States, the UK, Israel, the Dominican Republic, Canada, Brazil, Italy and Cuba. With a total of 930 health professionals, Cuba initially sent the largest medical contingent to Haiti. Another group of 200 Cuban-trained doctors from twenty-four countries in Africa and Latin American, and a dozen American doctors who graduated from medical schools in Havana, went to Haiti to provide reinforcement to existing Cuban medical teams. By comparison, the internationally renowned Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or Doctors without Borders) had approximately 269 health professionals working in Haiti. MSF is much better funded and has far more extensive medical supplies than the Cuban team. Media coverage of the international response did not pay attention to the huge Cuban role despite official praise from PAHO, WHO and UNICEF. The United States was by far the largest single contributor to the relief efforts. The international community also committed numerous major assets such as field hospitals, naval vessels, a hospital ship, aircraft carriers, transport aircraft and emergency facilities soon after the extent of the disaster became apparent. The Dominican Republic was the first country to mobilize resources to aid and rescue Haiti immediately after the earthquake. Progress in responding to the earthquake was hampered by a number of factors, including loss of life, a number of aftershocks, destroyed infrastructures, collapsed buildings blocking streets, the lack of electricity for gasoline station pumps, loss of the capital's seaport, and loss of air traffic control facilities. The damage to the Haitian government ministries, all of which suffered varying degrees of destruction and personnel deaths, impeded coordination of the disaster response. In April 2010, the Haitian government asked that food distribution in the Pétion-Ville camp cease in order to allow the normal economy to resume.  Appeals for aid  Appeals for international aid were immediately requested by Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States and his nephew, singer Wyclef Jean,\\"Appeals for aid after quake strikes Haiti\\". CNN. 13 January 2010 The American Red Cross quickly announced that it had run out of supplies in Haiti and appealed for public donations.  Response by national governments  Response by intergovernmental organizations  In early January 2010 the EU released €3 m in emergency funding. The European Council and its member nations later announced more than €429 million () in emergency humanitarian aid, rehabilitation aid and medium- to long-term reconstruction aid. The aid was to be provided as detailed: ;Humanitarian Assistance The EU pledged €122 million in humanitarian assistance: Emergency relief aid package: €30 million (incl. a €3 million ECHO fast-track decision). Commission funds were to be distributed via UN agencies, international NGOs and the Red Cross. €92 million from member countries. ;Support for Early Recovery and Reinforcing State Capacity. The European Commission pledged to provide €100 million for short term recovery and rehabilitation. ;Reconstruction and Rehabilitation. The European Commission pledged to provide €200 million from the 10th and 9th EDF funds for Haiti. They would be in addition to bilateral contributions from EU Member States' budgets. The European Union thus pledged at least €429 million to Haiti in both emergency and humanitarian aid to help the medium and long term work of rebuilding the country devastated by the earthquake. In addition, the 27 countries decided to send some 150 troops from the European Gendarmerie to ensure that humanitarian aid would reach the people affected by the earthquake. The financial contribution of the EU as a whole totaled €429 million, broken down as: *€92 million coming from contributions made by Member States, *€30 million from the European Commission itself, *€107 million from existing EU funds that were being redirected to Haiti, and another *€200 million shuffled for the medium and long term rehabilitation.  Organization of American States  The Organization of American States donated .  Union of South American Nations  The Union of South American Nations pledged to help rebuild Haiti on long terms.

Simpson's fundraising effort gained national and then international coverage, and by the end of the day of his sponsored bicycle ride his JustGiving webpage had amassed donations of over £60,000 ($96,700) from donors all over the world.

Long term effect of humanitarian response  As of 2015, 5 years after the earthquake, over 500,000 victims were still living in temporary shelters without electricity, plumbing or sewage. Lack of proper sanitation is thought to be the foundation upon which the ongoing cholera outbreak is based. Much of the US aid funding was hindered by US statutory restrictions limiting spending to US products, materials and employees, which had to be transported to Haiti. This not only raised the costs involved, compared to local, but also prevented the aid from stimulating the Haitian economy.

It uses gravel substrates for spawning and the unshed roe is toxic. Biology There are two distinct forms of the Blakhash marinka, a riverine form, and a faster growing migratory lacustrine form, however, both forms spawn in fast flowing currents over gravel beds. The females are sexually mature at4-11 years of age, the males at 3–8 years old. They are a fecund species and may lay between 12,000 and 122,500 eggs, although normally32,000 to 67,000 are laid in a spawning, the amount being dependent on the demographic make up of the spawning stock. Each egg is 2.3 mm in diameter. At a water temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 16 °C, and under controlled conditions, the eggs take 5 days to hatch. After six days from hatching the larval fish reach lengths of approximately 1 cm and has fully absorbed the yolk sac and starts to feed on plankton. By 25 days old they can be described as fry and have taken the form of small fish. When the fry grow to 16–30 mm they start to feed on small benthic animals and algae attached to the substrate. The unshed roe is toxic if consumed. There are three feeding types of Balkhash marinka. The form which occurs in mountain rivers feeds mainly on benthic organisms and does not feed on flying insects as its lower jaw is adapted to scraping algae and vascular plants off the substrate. The form living in lakes is also mainly a plant feeder while the form found in larger rivers is frequently a predator, especially if there are no other predatory fish present. This predatory type feeds mostly on benthic organisms, flying insects and on small fish such as stone loaches, as well as small terrestrial animals which fall into the stream, including vertebrates such as lizards. The rate at which the fish grows is depenent on the habitat and feeding type with those in mountain streams rarely growing to more than 1 kg and it reaches sexual maturity at a weight of 100 to 300 g. The lake form tends to be somewhat heavier, usually wighing 1.5 kg, and some individuals may grow to weights of 5–6 kg. The riverine form which is a facultative predator can grow to up to 12 kg, although normally specimens weigh 2 to 5 kg. Distribution The Balkhash marinka is found in lake Balkhash and the rivers of its catchment basin in Kazakhstan and in the Ili River in Xinjiang Provinve of western China. The form in Lake Issyk-Kul is regarded by some authorities as a separate taxon, the Issyk-Kul marinka Schizothorax pseudoaksaiensis issykkuli, which is a subspecies of the Ili marinka. Conservation The Balkhash marinka has not been assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature but its stocks have drastically declined and the species has been extirpated from many of the smaller lakes within its range. The main threats for this species, and the other indigenous fish of Lake Balkhash are the introduction of exotic fish species such as trout and zander, habitat destruction and the unstable hydrological conditions. Aquaculture The lacustrine form of Balkhash marinka, which feeds on mainly on plants, is the most suitable for growing in aquaculture, it adapts well to artificial feeding and can thrive on low-protein foods and can survive in cold water.

Le Guin, one of the significant writers of soft science fiction. Soft science fiction, or soft SF, is a category of science fiction with two different definitions. # It explores the \\"soft\\" sciences, and especially the social sciences (for example, anthropology, sociology, or psychology), rather than engineering or the \\"hard\\" sciences (for example, physics, astronomy, or chemistry). # It is not scientifically accurate or plausible; the opposite of hard science fiction. Soft science fiction of either type is often more concerned with character and speculative societies, rather than speculative science or engineering. The term first appeared in the late 1970s and is attributed to Australian literary scholar Peter Nicholls. Definition Peter Nicholls, the first person attested to have used the term soft science fiction. In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Peter Nicholls writes that \\"soft SF\\" is a \\"not very precise item of SF terminology\\" and that the contrast between hard and soft is \\"sometimes illogical.\\"\\"Soft SF,\\" Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, ed. John Clute and Peter Nicholls, 1995, . In fact, the boundaries between \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" are neither definite nor universally agreed-upon, so there is no single standard of scientific \\"hardness\\" or \\"softness.\\" Some readers might consider any deviation from the possible or probable (for example, including faster-than-light travel or paranormal powers) to be a mark of \\"softness.\\" Others might see an emphasis on character or the social implications of technological change (however possible or probable) as a departure from the science-engineering-technology issues that in their view ought to be the focus of hard SF. Given this lack of objective and well-defined standards, \\"soft science fiction\\" does not indicate a genre or subgenre of SF but a tendency or quality—one pole of an axis that has \\"hard science fiction\\" at the other pole. In Brave New Words, subtitled The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction, soft science fiction is given two definitions. The first definition is fiction that is primarily focused on advancements in, or extrapolations of, the soft sciences; that is social sciences and not natural sciences. The second definition is science fiction in which science is not important to the story. Etymology The term soft science fiction was formed as the complement of the earlier term hard science fiction. The earliest known citation for the term is in \\"1975: The Year in Science Fiction\\" by Peter Nicholls, in Nebula Awards Stories 11 (1976). He wrote \\"The same list reveals that an already established shift from hard sf (chemistry, physics, astronomy, technology) to soft sf (psychology, biology, anthropology, sociology, and even [...] linguistics) is continuing more strongly than ever.\\" History H. G. Wells, an early example of a soft science fiction writer. Poul Anderson, in Ideas for SF Writers (Sep 1998), described H. G. Wells as the model for soft science fiction: \\"He concentrated on the characters, their emotions and interactions\\" rather than any of the science or technology behind, for example, invisible men or time machines. See also the alternative Soft science fiction (n) for the second definition. Jeffrey Wallmann suggests that soft science fiction grew out of the gothic fiction of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley. Carol McGuirk, in Fiction 2000 (1992), states that the \\"soft school\\" of science fiction dominated the genre in the 1950s, with the beginning of the Cold War and an influx of new readers into the science fiction genre. The early members of the soft science fiction genre were Alfred Bester, Fritz Leiber, Ray Bradbury and James Blish, who were the first to make a \\"radical\\" break from the hard science fiction tradition and \\"take extrapolation explicitly inward\\", emphasising the characters and their characterisation. In calling out specific examples from this period, McGuirk describes Ursula K. Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness as \\"a soft SF classic\\". The New Wave movement in science fiction developed out of soft science fiction in the 1960s and 70s. The conte cruel was the standard narrative form of soft science fiction by the 1980s. During the 1980s cyberpunk developed from soft science fiction. McGuirk identifies two subgenres of soft science fiction: \\"Humanist science fiction\\" (in which human beings, rather than technology, are the cause of advancement or from which change can be extrapolated in the setting; often involving speculation on the human condition) and \\"Science fiction noir\\" (focusing on the negative aspects of human nature; often in a dystopian setting). Examples Audrey Niffenegger, author of the soft science fiction work The Time Traveler's Wife. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four might be described as soft science fiction, since it is concerned primarily with how society and interpersonal relationships are altered by a political force that uses technology mercilessly; even though it is the source of many ideas and tropes commonly explored in subsequent science fiction, (even in hard science fiction), such as mind control and surveillance. And yet, its style is uncompromisingly realistic, and despite its then-future setting, very much more like a spy novel or political thriller in terms of its themes and treatment. Karel Čapek's 1920 play R.U.R., which supplied the term robot (nearly replacing earlier terms such as automaton) and features a trope-defining climax in which artificial workers unite to overthrow human society, covers such issues as free will, a post-scarcity economy, robot rebellion, and post-apocalyptic culture. The play, subtitled \\"A Fantastic Melodrama,\\" offers only a general description of the process for creating living workers out of artificial tissue, and thus can be compared to social comedy or literary fantasy. George S. Elrick, in Science Fiction Handbook for Readers and Writers (1978), cited Brian Aldiss' 1959 short story collection The Canopy of Time (using the US title Galaxies Like Grains of Sand) as an example of soft science fiction based on the soft sciences. Frank Herbert's Dune series is a landmark of soft science fiction. In it, he deliberately spent little time on the details of its futuristic technology so he could devote it chiefly to addressing the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. Linguistic relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), the theory that language influences thought and perception, is a subject explored in some soft science fiction works such as Jack Vance's The Languages of Pao (1958) and Samuel R. Delany's Babel-17 (1966). In these works artificial languages are used to control and change people and whole societies. Science fictional linguistics are also the subject of varied works from Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The Dispossessed (1974), to the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Darmok\\" (1991), to Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash (1992), to the film Arrival (2016). Films set in outer space Soft science fiction filmmakers tend to extend to outer space certain physics that are associated with life on Earth's surface, primarily to make scenes more spectacular or recognizable to the audience. Examples are: * Presence of gravity without use of an artificial gravity system. * A spaceship's engines or an explosion generating sound despite the vacuum of space. * Spaceships changing directions without any visible thrusting activity. * Spaceship occupants enduring without any visible effort the enormous g-forces generated from a spaceship's extreme maneuvering (e.g. in a dogfight situation) or launch. * Astronauts instantly freezing to death or getting a frostbite when exposed to outer space * Spacecraft which suffer engine failures \\"falling\\" or coming to a stop, instead of continuing along their current trajectory or orbit as per inertia.

Thus, the name Rankoth Vehera can be roughly translated to English as \\"Gold Pinnacled Stupa\\". Along with the Kiri Vehera, it is one of the most revered stupas in Polonnaruwa.  Description  Rankoth Vehera is structure made entirely of brick, and has a base diameter of and a height of . However, the original shape of the stupa, particularly its upper portion, has been changed during renovation work carried out by later rulers and it is estimated that the original height of Rankoth Vehera may have been almost . Despite this, it remains the largest stupa in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, and the fourth largest stupa in the country. The stupa has four large Vahalkadas, a structure used for offering flowers and also to support the weight of a stupa. These are also made of brick. The stupa is located in the center of a large square terrace, which is also surrounded by a brick wall. The terrace has four entrances oriented to the four cardinal points, with sand paths leading to them. A stone inscription near one of the entrances mention that King Nissanka Malla observed and supervised the construction of the stupa from there. It is also mentioned that he worshiped the stupa from a small platform, which is located in a corner of the terrace.

Description  Test (shell) of a A. lixula It is a medium-sized sea urchin, characterized by its deep black color and its hemispherical shape. All of its spines are roughly the same size (no \\"secondary spines\\"), and worn erected (never dishevelled when in the water). The anus on the top is surrounded by four plates forming an anal valve. The oral face is nearly naked, the mouth being surrounded by soft, dark-greenish skin.ZIEMSKI Frédéric, André Frédéric, in: DORIS, 15/5/2014: Arbacia lixula (Linnaeus, 1758). Image:Arbacia lixula 03.JPGProfile Image:Black Sea Urchin (Arbacia lixula) in Croatia.jpg Sticking on a rock Image:Sea urchin upside down.JPGOral face Image:Arbacia lixula.JPGIn situ This species can be confused with the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, but the latter is never really black (though often very dark), has more dishevelled spines of many lengths, covers itself with debris, has spines around the mouth and no anal valve, and does not live exposed on the cliffs.  Habitat and geographical range  This species can be found on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesian Islands (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands), and less commonly, on the Atlantic coast of Western Africa and the Brazilian coast. It is found typically at shallow waters, at depths from 0 to 30 m, in rocky shores. It has a good resistance to hydrodynamism due to a good attachment strength to rocks.  Biology  This species feeds mainly on crustose red algae and small filamentous algae. In a marine reserve in the Mediterranean, its population increased by a factor over 10 between 1983 and 1992, from eight to 100 individuals per meter2. High seawater temperatures are thought to favour this species. When it was excluded from an area of the reserve, the density of filamentous algae increased.

Helicopsyche contains more than 230 species and are represented on all major faunal regions with highest diversity in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The genus was first described by Siebold, 1856. The abundance and wide distribution of the genus makes it important to fly fishing anglers, who know it as the \\"Speckled Peter\\".  Diagnosis  Larva: The case is dextrally coiled, with coils usually completely fused. Head is oval in dorsal view and smooth except for long setae and lateral carina. In lateral view the head has a trianguloid shape with the dorsal margin straight or slightly concave. Pronotum is strongly sclerotized while meso-and metantoum are weakly sclerotized. Anal claw with a single row of comb shaped hooks. Abdominal gills either are present or absent. Adult: maxillary palps 2-, 3-, or 4-jointed. Antennae as long as fore wing or two times longer than fore wing length. Cephalic warts variable. One pair of oblong central warts on pronotum. Mesonotum either has setal warts or not. Metanotum always with setal warts. Postscutellar line present. Male and females have similar fore wings.  Phylogenetic relationship  Helicopsyche probably forms the sister group to Rakiura McFarlane, 1973. The genus is monophyletic, since the Cochliopsyche was included by Johanson 2003. Cochliopsyche was formerly introduced by Müller (1885) as another genus within Helicopsychidae with spur formula 1, 2, 2, and very long antennae, which give them a leptocerid-like appearance. Helicopsyche now contains the six following subgenera Cochilopsyche Müller, 1885 (16 species); Petrotrichia Ulmer, 1910; Helicopsyche (subgenus) Siebold, 1856; Feropsyche Johanson, 1998 (73 species); Saetotricha Brauer, 1865; Galeopsyche.  Distribution  Europe: Italy, France, Portugal, Corsica, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Switzerland, Spain.

On the Breeding Season of Schizothorax plagiostomus. Pakistan J. Zool., vol. 49(2), pp 1-3. has an elongated sub cylindrical body with short, blunt and slightly prognathous upper jaw. Ventral surface of head and anterior part of body flattish, short, somewhat cone shaped and blunt. Snout usually smooth covered with warys in male. Interorbital space broad and flat. Mouth inferior, wide and slightly arched; lips fleshy and continuous, marginally sharply attenuated, lower lip papillae and reflected from jaw, margin of lower lip sharp, covered with firm and hard horny cartilage; a strip of papillae labial plate at chin present. Barbless two pairs. Pharyngeal teeth in three rows. Dorsal fin inserted about opposite to pelvic fins, its last undivided ray osseous, strong and serrated posterior, short than head. Caudal fin deeply emarginated. Scales very small and elliptical; lipids irregular. Geographically S. plagiostomus spread in different rivers, and tributaries throughout Himalaya extending to confines of China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkistan, Nepal, Ladkah, Tibet, Bhutan and north-eastern India (Day, 1958). In India, S. plagiostomus is the most important food fish of the Himalayan region, including Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, the Uttar Pradesh foothills and Assam (Day, 1958). It also plays an important role in commercial fish production (Bahuguna, 2002). From the subfamily Schizothorancinae 12 species are reported from Pakistan . The schizothoracine fishes provide a good material to study patterns of evolutionary modifications in terms of their biogeographic distribution. These species are expert in fast running high- elevation streams and rivers and show remarkable fitness for their environment. The Genus Schizothorax (Heckel, 1838) is one of the most diversified and abundant group with 68 species around Central Asia, Himalayas, Pakistan, India and Tibetan Plateau. Snow trout, Schizothorax plagiostomus(Heckel, 1838) is the most important food fish of different rivers, lakes and tributaries throughout Himalayas extending to parts of China, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, North East India, Kashmir and northern areas of Pakistan including River Panjkora Dir Upper. Upper parts of River Panjkora especially Kumrat Valley (From Thal to Chukyatan) Schizothorax were one found very abundantly, but due to a massive viral outbreak in June, 2016, its populations reduced drastically. According to Raizada (1985) S. plagiostomus weighs up to 2.5 kg and reaches 60 cm in length. It is sexually mature at 18–24 cm length and spawns in natural and artificial environments in two seasons, September–October and March–April. It spawns naturally in clear water on a gravelly or fine pebbled bed at 10–30 cm depth. Water current of 2.8–4 m/s, pH 7.5, dissolved oxygen concentrations Of 10–15 mg/l and gravel size of 50–60 mm are the optimum conditions for spawning. In the almost similar appearance of schizothorancine fishes, S. plagiostomus can be separated by its short, deep cornified lower jaw, with a transverse or usually sometimes only slightly curved sharp cutting margin. The lower and upper lips are connected by a smooth rounded corner. The particular arrangement of lower jaw structure was referred to as “sector mouth”  References  Category:Schizothorax ","title":"Schizothorax plagiostomus"},{"id":"25802616","text":"Schizothorax prenanti is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Schizothorax from the middle and upper parts of the Yangtze basin in China.Ye, S.; Li, Z.; Liu, J;, Zhang, T.; and Xie, S.

Career Weir signed for Hibernian in 1942, but did not play league football until the 1946–47 season due to the Second World War. During the war, he had made guest appearances for Cardiff City and Brighton. Upon the resumption of league football in 1946, Weir enjoyed instant success, scoring four goals as Hibs won their first post-war league match 9–1 against Queen of the South.Jeffrey, pp167. He had scored 14 goals in 19 league matches (and four goals in his only Scottish Cup appearance for Hibs) by the end of January 1947, but was allowed to join Blackburn for a fee of £10,000. This was perhaps because Hibs had the services of most of the Famous Five, which allowed the club to sell other talented players, including Weir, Leslie Johnston and Alex Linwood. Weir was not such a great success with Blackburn, however, and was allowed to return to Scotland in 1948, signing for Celtic for a fee of £7,000.Jock Weir, The Herald, 11 January 2003. This transfer signalled a change of attitude by Celtic, who \\"had treated wartime football with contempt\\" and had passed up the opportunity to field guest players of international standing, including Matt Busby. Weir's arrival did not immediately arrest Celtic's decline, and the club entered the final day of the 1947–48 season with an outside chance of being relegated. This possibility was averted, however, as Celtic won their match 3–2 against Dundee at Dens Park, with Weir scoring a hat-trick. Weir then went on to score two goals in the Glasgow Cup final against Third Lanark that year. Normally that trophy would have been held in low esteem, but a crowd of 87,000 attended, realising the potential of the Celtic support. Weir was part of the Celtic team that won the 1950–51 Scottish Cup,Former Celtic star Weir passes away, www.breakingnews.ie, 9 January 2003. beating Motherwell 1–0 in the final. Journalist Bob Crampsey, who stated that Weir \\"was very, very fast\\", also wrote that he was an \\"unlucky\\" player, as he missed out on the positive effect that Jock Stein was to have on Celtic. Coincidentally, Weir later had a brief spell with Llanelli A.F.C., the Welsh club that Stein played for. Despite making 100 appearances for Celtic, Weir did not earn international honours due to stiff competition from several players, including Lawrie Reilly. In his later life, Weir suffered from dementia, which family members believed was caused by his frequent heading of the ball during his football career; this was discussed during a BBC Scotland investigative television programme on the subject in 2000, also featuring another former Celtic forward Billy McPhail who was suffering from a similar condition.Heading for Trouble (transcript), Frontline Scotland, 2 May 2000  References External links * * Category:1923 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Sportspeople from West Lothian Category:Association football wingers Category:Scottish footballers Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. wartime guest players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. wartime guest players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Llanelli Town A.F.C. players Category:Dumbarton F.C. players Category:Portadown F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:NIFL Premiership players ","title":"Jock Weir"},{"id":"25802756","text":"Malkapur Vidhan Sabha constituency is one of the seven constituencies of Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) located in the Buldhana district.

The institute was supported by various organizations, most importantly the trade union Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees.

According to board member Leif Sande, there had been a dire lack of external demand for research. Director of NORISS was Jon Bingen. It had a small staff of researchers, in addition to a group of external senior advisors who worked for the institute sporadically. Senior advisors include Hallvard Bakke, Johan J.

He was Dean Academics, Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences and Head, Department of History at Kashmir University. After his superannuation in 2005, he became the Director of the newly founded Centre for Kashmir Studies and later held the Shaikhul Alam Chair at Kashmir University until August 2008. Biography Ishaq Khan was the son of a prominent businessman, Ghulam Ahmad Khan, who was one of the local pioneers of hotel industry (Kashmir Guest House at Lal Chowk until 1978) in Kashmir. Being a staunch supporter of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, Ahmad Khan was jailed for his underground political activities and died on 4 April 1956 after his release. In his Weekly Khalid (April 1956), Khwaja Sadruddin Mujahid, editor, and jailmate of Ghulam Ahmad Khan along with Ghulam Mohiuddin Shah, alleged that the illness and subsequent death of his friend was caused by slow poisoning in the Central Jail of Srinagar (See Ishaq,Crisis of a Kashmiri Muslim: Spiritual and Intellectual. While from his father's family, Ishaq traces his genealogy to the Pathans of Rampur (See Ishaq Perspectives on Kashmir: Historical Dimensions, 1983, his mother belonged to the known family of Baigs who had settled around the Hariparbat Fort in Srinagar after the Mughal invasion of Kashmir in 1586. Ishaq's wife, Mahmooda Khan, taught English at the famous Tyndale Biscoe Memorial School, Srinagar for nearly four decades. His eldest son, Mohammad Aamir Khan (B.A. International Islamic University, Malaysia; M.A. Central University, Hyderabad) works at The Tribune. Education and work Ishaq Khan completed his PHD under the supervision of Mohibbul Hasan in 1975. He was the first PHD of Kashmir University in the Faculty of Social Sciences. He was Professor of History at Kashmir University from 1988 to 2005 after serving the same university as Lecturer (1970–1982) and Reader (1982–1988). He was nominated as Member of the Indian Council of Historical Research by the Government of India, and presided over the Punjab History Congress (Medieval Section) in 2001. He was elected to Senior Leverhulme Fellowship by the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies in 1992, and was also offered a fellowship by St Cross College, Oxford. Philosophical and political views Ishaq Khan identifies himself as a researcher and a traveller in the Sufi Path who has always preferred to live in relative seclusion. His most widely read book Kashmir's Transition to Islam: The Role of Muslim Rishis has been described as a “pioneering” “authoritative”, and “seminal” work on the social dimension of Islam in Kashmir and “an important critique of the concept of ‘syncretism’.” Probably he is the first Indian historian who has also written extensively against using Islam as an ideology. He regards Islam as essentially faith rather than politico-religious ideology. His critical views on the so-called Islamic ideology, though written much before some well known contemporary American critics of ideology like Hamza Yusuf and Imam Zaid Shakir, have not yet received the scholarly attention due to them. Although rooted in Sufism, Ishaq Khan at times has been extremely bold in his criticism of using jihad for political purposes. He was also critical of General S.K. Sinha, former governor of J&K;, for his “saffronisation” agenda in Kashmir. He was removed as the first and founding Director of the Centre for Kashmir Studies, Kashmir University, for the views he expressed at the inaugural session of the newly founded UGC centre. Shortly, this centre was high jacked by the Indian Chapter of South Asia Foundation and renamed Institute of Kashmir Studies, thanks to Gen. Sinha's vested interest, as Chancellor of Kashmir University, in promoting “saffronisation” of Kashmir history. Such development on the campus turned Ishaq Khan into a rebel mystic poet. His Kashmir: Humanity Stifled, though an unknown poetical work, has much to say about the wrongs of contemporary Kashmir in terse verse. The noted Indian Professor of English and former Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University (South Campus), G.K. Das, describes Ishaq Khan as a “poet philosopher” in the prestigious journal: Indian Literature(May–June 2010). Ishaq Khan supports Gen. Mushraff's views on Kashmir. Although love for independent Kashmir is reflected in his poetical compositions, Ishaq seems to favour the realistic solution of the Kashmir problem within the framework of the Indian constitution. International recognition His books and research articles have received critical recognition in prestigious academic journals of international repute in India and abroad including The Indian Historical Review; The American Historical Review; Studies in History; Oxford Journal of Islamic Studies; Pacific Affairs; Journal of Asian Studies; South Asia Research; The New York Review of Books; Indian Literature, The Indian Archives; Itihas; and scores of newsmagazines: Indian Book Chronicle; Bulletin Henry Martyn Institute; The Times of India; The Indian Express; The Hindu; Frontline; The Indian Foreign Review; The Hindustan Times; etc. Historians, social scientists and littérateurs who have highlighted the contribution of Ishaq Khan to historical research in various publications are: Professors Mohibbul Hasan, T.N. Madan, Richard Maxwell Eaton, Harbans Mukhia, Mushirul Hasan, Christian W Troll, Barbara Metcalf, Gail Minaul, S. Gopal, K.

Jacobsen, Carla Bellarny, Jamal Malik, Anna Aknsoy, Ali Sutaan Asami, Bhagwan Josh, P. Sahadevan. The world-famous sociologist Professor T.N. Madan observes: “Khan chose to tread this straight but often difficult path of Islamic piety and the pursuit of knowledge many years ago, and has done so with steadfast step and distinction...I have high regard for Professor Mohammad Ishaq Khan and I greatly value his scholarly contributions.” Foreword to Crisis of a Kashmiri Muslim: Spiritual and Historical '' The well-known writer Pankaj Mishra writes :“Dr. Khan...has done pioneering work on Islam’s acculturation in the Hindu- Buddhist environment of Kashmir. He is a small, round-faced man, gentle in demeanor; he speaks slowly, as if unaccustomed to talking much of his work, but in clear qualified sentences that indicate a quietly active mind. During... the years of the insurgency...he has done his best work: a book on the spiritual dimensions of Islam that stressed the contemplative aspects of the faith over the ideological ones....Dr. Khan’s allegiance was to the Sufi tradition of Kashmir....His suspicion of Islam as ideology had only grown after the violence and suffering caused by the insurgency ... Dr. Khan (is) committed to the intellectual life ...” 'The New York Review of Books'' Death After suffering a heart attack, Professor Khan was admitted to the SK Institute of Medical Sciences Intensive Care Unit, where he died on 5 April 2013.

Incorporated on June 5, 1866, MSMS is a non-profit, membership organization of physicians, graduates completing residency programs, and medical school students. The headquarters is located in East Lansing, Michigan, near Michigan State University and the capital city of Lansing. MSMS is the state affiliate of the American Medical Association. The Michigan State Medical Society publishes the weekly Medigram eNewsletter and the bi-monthly Michigan Medicine magazine. Mission The mission of the Michigan State Medical Society is to improve the lives of physicians so they may best care for the people they serve. Michigan State Medical Society headquarters History In 1819, five physicians organized the Michigan Medical Society in Detroit. Its purpose was \\"to examine medical students and certify those so deemed as doctors.\\" The group later reorganized in Ann Arbor as the Peninsula Medical Society in 1851. That organization disbanded by 1859. Formation of the Michigan State Medical Society took place June 5, 1866 in the Supreme Court Room of Odd Fellows Hall in Detroit, near Woodward and E. Jefferson Avenues. About 100 physicians from all areas in Michigan were present. The society pledged \\"to elevate professional and medical education and to cultivate the advancement of medical science.\\" The society also adopted the code of ethics of the American Medical Association (AMA). Among its first projects was the establishment of a state public health department, which was created in 1873. The society was housed in various buildings in Detroit until a headquarters was constructed in Lansing. The state society, a voluntary, professional organization, provides postgraduate training for physicians and strives to improve the public health by its public service, and educational activities.

Upon its completion in 1961, Yamasaki explained, \\"The intent was to build a serene and inviting building to express the idealism and humanity of the medical profession.\\" The terraced landscape, the slender columns, 31 rippling arches and the graceful lines inspired visitors to remark, \\"It seems to float in the air.\\" In 1991, the Yamasaki firm designed an atrium connecting the original building to the Cyrus M. Stockwell wing, named for the society's first president. Yamasaki's best known design was the World Trade Center in New York City. The Michigan State Medical Society building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's also designated as a Michigan Historical Site. Leadership *Julie L.

In the 1970s, Lorong Halus was predominantly a farming area with several Malay rural villages such as Kampong Sungei Blukar and Kampong Teban, ponds and coconut and rubber plantations. A large part of the area had formerly been used as a sewage ground (for night-soil collection) and a refuse dump. The sewage ground was shut down in the 1980s following the end of the local night- soil industry in Singapore at around that time, while the dumping ground was closed down on 31 March 1999, and since then all of Singapore's garbage has been sent to Pulau Semakau Landfill (incinerated beforehand) just off the mainland's southern coast.

As a result of multiple translations, there are multiple spellings for some of the names, explained in more detail in the articles concerning them. The sole demon which appears in Pseudomonarchia Daemonum but not in the Ars Goetia is Pruflas. right Demons= Kings Dictionnaire Infernal illustration of Bael. Paimon as depicted in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal, 1863 edition. Asmodeus as depicted in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal. Mathers' The Goetia corresponds to Pruflas' illustration from the Dictionnaire Infernal. A woodcarving of Belial and some of his followers from Jacobus de Teramo's book Buche Belial (1473). The Seal of Belial according to the Ars Goetia. # According to le Grand Grimoire, Baal (or Bael) is the head of the infernal powers. He is also the first demon listed in Wierus' Pseudomonarchia daemonum. According to Wierus, Bael is first king of Hell with estates in the east. He has three heads: a toad, a man, and a cat. He also speaks in a raucous, but well formed voice, and commands 66 legions. Bael teaches the art of invisibility, and may be the equivalent of Baal or Baalzebub, one of the Seven princes of Hell. # Paimon (also Paimonia, Paymon) is one of the Kings of Hell, more obedient to Lucifer than other kings are, and has two hundred legions of demons under his rule. He has a great voice and roars as soon as he comes, speaking in this manner for a while, until the conjurer compels him and then he answers clearly the questions he is asked. When a conjurer invokes this demon he must look towards the northwest, the direction of Paimon's house, and when Paimon appears he must be allowed to ask the conjurer what he wishes and be answered, in order to obtain the same from him. ## Paimon teaches all arts, philosophies and sciences, and secret things; he can reveal all mysteries of the Earth, wind and water, what the mind is, and where it is, and everything the conjurer wants to know. He gives good familiars, dignities and confirms them, and binds men to the conjurer's will. ## If Paimon is cited alone, some offering or sacrifice must be done, and he will accept it; then two kings called Beball (Bebal or Labal) and Abalam (Abalim) will go to him together with other spirits, often twenty-five legions; but these other spirits do not always come unless the conjurer call upon them. ## Paimon is depicted as a man with an effeminate face, wearing a precious crown, and riding a dromedary. Before him often goes a host demons with the shape of men, playing trumpets, cymbals, and any other sort of musical instrument. # Beleth (also spelled Bilet, Bileth and Byleth) is a mighty and terrible king of Hell, who has eighty-five legions of demons under his command. He rides a war horse, and all kind of music is heard before him, according to most authors on demonology and the most known grimoires. According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum Noah's son Ham was the first in invoking him after the flood, and wrote a book on Mathematics with his help. ## When appearing he looks very fierce to frighten the conjurer or to see if he is courageous. The conjurer must be brave, and holding a hazel wand in his hand must draw a triangle by striking towards the South, East, and upwards, and command Beleth into it by means of some conjurations. ## If he does not obey, the conjurer must rehearse all threats the conjurations said. Then, Beleth will obey and do all that he is commanded, but the conjurer must be respectful and pay homage unto Beleth due to his rank, and hold a silver ring in the middle finger of the left hand against his face, as it is the use of hellish kings and princes before Amaymon. ## Beleth gives all the love of men and women he is commanded until the conjurer is satisfied. # Purson (also Curson, Pursan) is a Great King of Hell, being served and obeyed by twenty-two legions of demons. He knows of hidden things, can find treasures, and tells past, present and future. Taking a human or aerial body he answers truly of all secret and divine things of Earth and the creation of the world. He also brings good familiars.

He can tell present, past and future, discover witches and hidden things, create storms and make the water rough by means of them, and also bring down walls and build towers. This demon is portrayed as a lion holding a snake in his hand and riding a black horse. The etymology of his name seems to be the Latin word 'vinea', vine, that is also the name given to an ancient war machine made of wood and covered with leather and branches, used to overthrow walls. # Balam (also Balaam, Balan) is a great and powerful king of Hell who commands over forty legions of demons. He gives perfect answers on things past, present, and to come, and can also make men invisible and witty. Balam is depicted as being three-headed. One head is the head of a bull, the second of a man, and the third of a ram. He has flaming eyes and the tail of a serpent. He carries a hawk on his fist and rides a strong bear.

Zagan is depicted as a griffin-winged bull that turns into a man after a while. # Belial (also Belhor, Baalial, Beliar, Beliall, Beliel) is listed as the sixty-eighth spirit of The Lesser Key of Solomon. He is a King of Hell with 80 legions of demons, and 50 legions of spirits, under his command. He was created as the first, after Lucifer.Mathers, S.L.

To others, he teaches mathematical sciences and handicrafts, can make men invisible and lead them to hidden treasures, and answers every question formulated to him.

Sabnock is depicted as a soldier with armor and weapons, the head of a lion, and riding a pale horse. # Shax (also spelled Chax, Shan, Shass, Shaz, and Scox) is a Great Marquis of Hell, and has power over 30 legions of demons on evil horses. He takes away the sight, hearing and understanding of any person under the conjurer's request, and steals money out of kings' houses, carrying it back to the people. He also steals horses and everything the conjurer asks. Shax can also discover hidden things if they are not kept by evil spirits, and sometimes gives good familiars, but sometimes those familiars deceive the conjurer. He should not be bothered too often. Shax is thought to be faithful and obedient, but is a great liar and will deceive the conjurer unless obliged to enter a magic triangle drawn on the floor. He will then speak marvellously and tell the truth. He knows when lies are told and uses these to teach lessons. He is depicted as a stork that speaks with a hoarse but subtle voice; his voice changes into a beautiful one once he enters the magic triangle. # Orias (also spelled Oriax) is a Great Marquis of Hell, and has thirty legions of demons under his command. He knows and teaches the virtues of the stars and the mansions of the planets (the influence of each planet depending on the astrological sign in which it is in a specific moment and the influence of that sign on an individual depending on how the zodiac was configured at the moment of his/her birth or at the moment of asking a question to the astrologist); he also gives dignities, prelacies, and the favour of friends and foes, and can metamorphose a man into any shape. # Andras Andras is a Great Marquis of Hell, having under his command thirty legions of demons. He sows discord among people. According to the Goetia, Andras was a Grand Marquis of Hell, appearing with a winged angel's body and the head of an owl or raven, riding upon a strong black wolf and wielding a sharp and bright sword. He was also responsible for sowing discord, and commanded 30 infernal legions. He is the 63rd of the 72 spirits of Solomon. Andras was considered to be a highly dangerous demon, who could kill the conjuring magician and his assistants if precautions were not taken. The Dutch demonologist Johannes Wier, in his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, says of Andras: > Andras is a great marquesse, and seemes in an angels shape with a head like > a blacke night raven, riding upon a blacke and a verie strong woolfe, > flourishing with a sharpe sword in his hand, he can kill the maister, the > servant, and all assistants, he is author of discords, and ruleth thirtie > legions. Another demonologist, Collin de Plancy, also mentions Andras in his writings: > Grand Marquis of Hell. He appears to have the body of an angel and the head > of a wood owl, and to be riding a black wolf and carrying in his hand a > pointed saber. He teaches those whom he favors to kill their enemies, > masters and servants. He stirs up trouble and dissension. He commands thirty > legions. # Andrealphus (also Androalphus) appears as the 54th demon in > Johann Weyer's tome on demonology Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and is described > as a great Marquis with the appearance of a Peacock who raises great noises > and teaches cunning in astronomy, and when in human form also teaches > geometry in a perfect manner. He is also described as ruling over thirty > legions and as having the ability to turn any man into a bird. Andrealphus > also appears as the 65th demon in the Goetia where he is described with > similar traits, but also including the ability to make men subtle in all > things pertaining to Mensuration, among other things. # Kimaris (also known > by the alternate names Cimeies, Cimejes and Cimeries) is most widely known > as the 66th demon of the first part of the Lemegeton (popularly known as the > Ars Goetia). He is described as a warrior riding a goodly black horse, and > possesses the abilities of locating lost or hidden treasures, teaching > trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and making a man into a warrior of his > own likeness. He holds the rank of marquis, and is served by 20 legions. He > also rules over all the spirits of Africa. Much the same description is > found in the earlier text of Johann Weyer's catalog of demons, > Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (published 1563). Earlier still is the Munich > Handbook of Necromancy: Clm 849 (published by Richard Kieckhefer, as > Forbidden Rites: a necromancer's manual of the 15th century 1998) which > lists an entity named Tuvries with much the same characteristics, except > that he has 30 legions of servitors, and can cause a person to cross seas > and rivers quickly. Most likely, Tuvries is a mistranscription of Cymries. > Kimaris, as Cimeries, is also found on Anton LaVey's list of infernal names, > although it is not known why LaVey chose Kimaris as one of the comparatively > few Goetic daimons included.

History A textile industry was established in India in the middle of 19th century. The need for trained technical personnel to drive that was felt in Bengal which led to the establishment of the institution. The Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore was established in 1908 as the Government Central Weaving Institute with a two-year certificate course in weaving in a rented house in Serampore. In 1938, a three-year diploma course in textile technology was started which was upgraded to degree course in 1957 under the affiliation of Calcutta University. The institution was renamed as College of Textile Technology Serampore, which was changed to its present name in 2005. From the year 2009 B.Tech in A.P.M and M.Tech in Chemical Processing of Textile was started. Present status Administrative building Undergraduate and post graduate courses are: * BTech in Textile Technology * BTech in Computer Science and Engineering * BTech in Information Technology * BTech in Apparel Production and Management * M.Tech in Textile Technology * M.Tech in Chemical Processing Of Textiles  Department of Textile Technology  This is the oldest department of the college. Earlier affiliated with University of Calcutta, the college has contributed immensely in providing technical manpower to the textile industry of the country. The department offers Post Graduate Programme ( M.Tech) as well. The department has state of the art machines in its spinning, weaving, Textile Processing lab and Testing lab. Computer science and information technology departments CSE and IT department buildings The Computer Science and Engineering Department and Information Technology Department were formed in 2001 and 2000 respectively. Due to the formation of West Bengal University of Technology, the Serampore Textile College incorporated in its curriculum the CSE and IT departments and changed its name to the present name. The CSE and IT departments share all the labs as the subjects are very similar. Laboratories include electronics, microprocessors, communication engineering, software labs (operating systems, database management systems (DBMS), media, control and systems simulation), basic programming (subjects like Java, World Wide Web, Artificial Intelligence). The physics lab, chemistry lab, and mechanical workshop and electrical workshop, are shared among all departments.

It is found in dry and moist regions in its distribution. Various parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicine, but there is no scientific evidence it is effective or safe for treating any disease. Description= Morphology  Illustration from The Botanical Register showing leaves and flowers Leaves of W. tinctoria Simple leaves with opposite leaf arrangement. Upper leaves are glabrous. Close-up of the white flowers. Flowers are insect pollinated. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, ranging from 3 m to 15 m in height but also reaching up to 18 m. The bark is smooth, yellowish-brown and about 10 mm thick, producing a milky-white latex. Leaves are simple, oppositely arranged, ovate, obtusely acuminate and are 10–20 cm long and 5 cm wide. Leaves are glabrous and sometimes pubescent beneath. Leaf stalks are very short. The flowers appear (in India) from March to May, peaking from April to June. White flowers appear in corymb-like cymes, 5–15 cm across, at the end of branches. Flowers have five white petals 2–3 cm long which turn creamish yellow as they age. The flowers have oblong petals which are rounded at the tip, and are similar to flowers of frangipani. Fruiting is in August and the fruit is cylindrical, blackish-green speckled with white, long horn-like and united at tip. The seeds are brown and flat with bunch of white hairs. Seed dispersal is by wind and pollination is by insects. In his 1862 book on timber trees of South Asia, Edward Balfour mentions its distribution across the then Madras Presidency of British India especially in the Coimbatore jungles, and reports that it was \\"very common in all forests of Bombay\\". In the same book, Balfour quotes William Roxburgh's comparison of the whiteness of the wood as \\"coming nearer to ivory than any I know\\". Earlier in 1824, the plant specimens were presented by the British East India Company to the Royal Horticultural Society as illustrated and recorded in botanical register founded by Sydenham Edwards and at the time published by James Ridgway. Phytochemistry The plant contains wrightial, a triterpenoid phytochemical,Wrightial, a new terpene from Wrightia tinctoria. Ramchandra P.; Basheermiya M.; Krupadanam G. L. D.; Srimannarayana G. Journal of natural products, 1993, vol. 56, no10, pp. 1811-1812 along with cycloartenone, cycloeucalenol, β-amyrin, and β-sitosterol isolated from the methanol extract of the immature seed pods. Taxonomy The following are considered to be synonyms of Wrightia tinctoria: * Allamanda verticillata Desf. * Alstonia oleandrifolia Lodd. * Nerium jaspideum Span. Invalid * Cerium tinctorium Sweet Illegitimate * Cerium tinctorium Roxb. * Wrightia laciniata A.DC. * Wrightia timorensis Miq. * Wrightia tinctoria subsp. tinctoria Distribution and habitat It is mainly found in Australia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor and Vietnam. Within India, it is found in most of the peninsular and central India except the northern and north-eastern states. Ecology It is a slow to moderate-growing plant. Plants commence flowering when about 5–8 years old. It grows in a wide range of soil types ranging from arid, semi-arid, gravely or rocky soils and moist regions, especially on dry sandy sites or hillsides and valleys. The tree responds well to coppicing, and also produces root suckers. It tolerates moderate shading and is often found as undergrowth in deciduous forests. It also tolerates high uranium levels in soils. In India, the fungus Cercospora wrightia is known to cause leaf spot disease of Wrightia tinctoria. Uses The flowers, leaves, fruits and seeds are edible. The tree is harvested from the wild as a medicine and source of a dye and wood. Leaves are extracted as fodder for livestock. The leaves, flowers, fruits and roots are sources of indigo-yielding glucoside, which produces a blue dye or indigo- like dye. About 100–200 kilos of leaves are needed to prepare 1 kilo of dye. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental in the tropics. The branches are trampled into the puddle soil in rice field for green manuring. It is recommended as a good agroforestry species as it intercrops well. Bharath art and crafts artisans said the wood of Wrightia tinctoria is used extensively in Channapatna (a toy town of India) for carving and lacquer work of world famous Channapatna Toys. The timber is high in quality and valuable. The white wood is used for turnery, carving, toy making, matchboxes, small boxes and furniture. High levels of extraction is resulting in it becoming scarce in some regions. The sap added to milk has been reported to have preservative properties; the milk will remain fresh for some time, the taste remaining unaltered. Traditional medicine In Ayurveda and other traditional medicine practices, the plant is called shwetha kutaja and its seeds are called indrayava or indrajava. There is no high-quality clinical evidence that it is safe or has any beneficial effect.

Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co- founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Società Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). Early life Born in Cuneo in 1860, Giovanni Battista was the eldest of four brothers born to Giovanni Ceirano, a watchmaker, and Teresa Corino.Treccani, Dizionario-Biografico. Profile of Giovanni Ceirano Aged twenty, devoured by the \\"sacred fire of mechanics\\", he left Cuneo for Turin with the aim to broaden his technical horizon, which was too limited at his father's small watchmaker workshop. Career F.I.A.T. 4hp 1901 Ceirano In 1888, after eight years of \\"apprenticeship\\", he rented a storage space and started to build bicycles with his brothers Ernesto and Matteo.Some offline anglophone sources may describe John and Matthew The bicycles were sold under the name of Welleyes, because at the time English names had more clout with the public. At the end of 1898 the company Ceirano GB & C was founded with the intention to build cars. Among the workers was Vincenzo Lancia, who founded Lancia. The first car was designed by Aristide Faccioli. It was equipped with a small twin engine (663 cc) and a two speed gearbox. This car was also named Welleyes and presented to the public in mid-1899. Due to the success of this car a small-series production was planned. This was impossible to implement in the cramped spaces of Ceirano GB & C.. For this reason, Ceirano contacted members of the aristocracy and finance Turin in order to form a company that can build a factory. The preliminary agreement was reached on July 1, 1899, signed by the group of aristocrats. On July 11, 1899 Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino - F.I.A.T. was officially founded and the 'Welleyes' was launched as the F.I.A.T. 4hp. When F.I.A.T. acquired \\"Ceirano GB & C.\\" Giovanni Battista was paid for his shares and employed as sales agent for Italy, but being an employee and representative was not in his nature so he left Fiat after only one year to found \\"Fratelli Ceirano\\" with his brother Matteo. In July 1903 'Fratelli Ceirano' became Società Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) with the cars badged as 'Rapid'. Death In 1905 he retired to Bordighera where he died in 1912.

After resigning from Galen in 2001, he went on to form a second successful pharmaceutical company, the Almac Group. Career Dr. McClay was born in Cookstown, County Tyrone in 1932 and was the youngest of six children. He attended Cookstown High School and Belfast College of Technology (now Belfast Metropolitan College) later qualifying as a pharmacist in 1953 after apprenticeship. In 1955, he joined Glaxo, where he worked for 13 years as a medical rep, before co-founding the company, Galen, with his friend and fellow Pharmacist turned medical rep Bertie Robinson in Craigavon in 1968. Sir Allen and Bertie Robinson shared many investments together including the Connors Chemists chain and Galen Research. Sir Allen left Galen, which produces contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy drugs, in 2001, having become unhappy with the company's direction after its London Stock Exchange flotation in 1997. McClay retired from Galen on 31 September, and the following day rented accommodation close to the site Galen occupied for what would become his second successful company, Almac Sciences. McClay purchased five divisions of Galen Holdings plc. and formed Almac in January 2002. Almac provides services including research & development and manufacturing to other pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The company, whose turnover is £167m, employs more than 1500 people in Craigavon and has expanded into England, Scotland and the United States. In 1973, McClay and Bertie Robinson invested in Connors Chemists, a pharmacy in Warrenpoint, which developed into a chain of branches across the UK managed by his brother Howard, and was sold to The Boots Company in 1998. Philanthropy McClay established the McClay Trust in 1997, a charitable organisation which \\"support[s] research and development activities within\\" Queen's University Belfast. The trust has donated £20 million to the university, which has included sponsorship of PhD studentships at the university's Cancer Research centre. The trust also funded the £3.5m McClay Research Centre at the School of Pharmacy which opened in 2002, and contributed money to the building of the new University Library at Queen's, which opened in 2009 and is now named after McClay. Sir George Bain, a former vice-chancellor at Queen's, has described McClay as \\"the most significant philanthropist Northern Ireland has ever known\\". In recognition the university commissioned two portraits of McClay by local artist Ian Cumberland, one of which was gifted to his wife the other is on display in the Library. McClay was reported by the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List to be Northern Ireland's sixth richest person, with his wealth estimated at £190 million. In 2009, he used his wealth to establish the McClay Foundation, a charitable trust focused on cancer research. McClay received an OBE in 1994, followed by a CBE in 2000 for contributions to the pharmaceutical industry in Northern Ireland. In the New Year Honours List of 2006 he was made Knight Bachelor for services to business and charity. McClay married his partner Heather Topping in 2009 in the United States. He had no children. He died on 12 January at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He had been receiving treatment for cancer.

Military career=World War I Deighton enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps on 15 March 1917 as a transport driver. As a corporal mechanic, he volunteered to fly as an observer/gunner in the rear seat of No. 20 Squadron's Bristol F.2 Fighters.Franks et.al. (1997), p.13. Deighton flew as an observer/gunner for four pilot aces: Captain Wilfred Beaver, Lieutenants David Weston, Leslie Capel, and Ernest Lindup. Deighton scored his first victory on 11 April 1918 and closed out his string on 23 June 1918. In total, he was credited with destroying ten enemy fighters and an observation plane, and with four other German fighters claimed 'out of control'. Deighton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal on 7 June 1918. He and Beaver were forced down by a German Albatros D.V on 13 June 1918, but were uninjured. However, Deighton was subsequently injured on 15 July 1918 and returned to Britain. Deighton's Distinguished Conduct Medal was gazetted to him on 1 October 1918. The award citation read: :67051 Corporal (Acting-Serjeant) E. A. Deighton, Royal Air Force. (Cheltenham). :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In little more than a fortnight he has shot down five enemy aircraft. He has shown remarkable marksmanship and coolness in action, and is a valuable asset in his squadron. Unusually, the original award recommendations still exist. One of them was written on 27 May 1918; Captain Beaver followed up with a second one two days later. Both give more detailed accounts of Deighton's exploits than the award citation, mainly enumerating his aerial victories. World War II Deighton apparently returned to service during World War II, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Warwickshire Army Cadet Force on 25 November 1942. He finally resigned his commission on 12 May 1945. Nothing more is known of him until his death in Bournemouth, England on 5 December 1957.

The phrase is a translation of the original Koine Greek phrase \\"'\\" (eis toùs aionas ton aiṓnōn), which occurs in the original Greek texts of the Christian New Testament (e.g. in Phillippians 4:20). In the Latin Vulgate, the same phrase is translated as in saecula saeculorum. The phrase expresses the eternal duration of God's attributes. Other variations of the phrase are found at e.g. Eph 3:21, as εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος τῶν αἰώνων, ἀμήν, here referring to the glory of God the Father; this may be translated as \\"from all generations for ever and ever, amen\\". The translation of aiōnes can be temporal, in which case it would correspond to the English \\"ages\\". Then again, it can be spatial, and then one would need to translate in spatial terms, describing the cosmos so as to include both the heavenly and earthly world. In the New Testament, the phrase occurs twelve times in the Book of Revelation alone, and another seven times in epistles, but not in the gospels: *Galatians 1:5: \\"... δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων, ἀμήν.\\" *Philippians 4:20: \\"\\" *1 Timothy 1:17: \\"\\" *2 Timothy 4:18: \\"\\" *Hebrews 13:21: \\"\\" *1 Peter 4:11: \\"\\" *Revelation 1:6: \\"\\" *5:13: \\"\\" *7:12, 10:6, 11:5, 15:7, 19:3, 20:10, 22:5: \\"\\" In the Greek LXX translation of the Old Testament, the phrase \\" appears in Psalm 83:5. The Hebrew text here (Psalm 84:5; different counting!) reads , which simply means \\"forever\\" or \\"continuously\\". Other Hebrew verses are more similar to the \\"ages of ages\\" formula: For example verses such as \\"\\" (Psalm 90:2), or \\"\\" (Jeremiah 25:5), or \\"\\" (Nehemiah 9:5). All these slightly different variations mean more or less the same: \\"(and) from (the) eternity to (the) eternity\\". The Hebrew (\\"in eternity and forever\\" or \\"in eternity and beyond\\"), which appears in verses such as Micah 4:5, was rendered in Greek LXX as ', in Latin as ' \\"for eternity and beyond\\", and in English Bible translations usually as \\"for ever and ever\\". In Aramaic the same phrase was rendered as (lalmey almaya, literally \\"from the eternity of eternities\\" or \\"from the world of worlds\\"), for instance in the Kaddish, an important prayer in the Jewish liturgy. The formula has a prominent place in Christian liturgy both of the Latin and the Byzantine tradition, in the Liturgy of the Hours and the Eucharist: Trinitarian doxologies ending with the formula conclude the Psalms (Gloria Patri), many prayers spoken by the priest, and hymns such as the ' by Thomas Aquinas or the Veni Creator Spiritus. When it is followed by an Amen, the last two words (saeculorum, Amen) may be abbreviated Euouae in medieval musical notation. Vernacular liturgical traditions often don't translate the Greek and Latin formula literally: The English translations of Christian prayers issued in 1541 by King Henry VIII 1541 and the later Book of Common Prayer replace it by \\"world without end\\"; the German Lutheran tradition reads \\"von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit\\", \\"from eternity to eternity\\", which is probably based on Old Testament formulas such as Psalm 90:2, Jeremiah 25:5, and Nehemiah 9:5, quoted in Hebrew above.

He was born in Petrograd to the geophysicist Yevgeniy Alfredovich Heintz (1869–1918) and Olga Fyodorovna Hoffmann (1871–1958). He had two older siblings. In 1919 the family fled to Norway. He studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1919 to 1920 and at the Royal Frederick University from 1920, where he graduated in palaeontology in 1928. He was then hired as a curator at the Paleontological Museum of Tøyen. He took the dr.philos. degree in 1932 on the thesis The Structure of Dinichthys. A Contribution to our Knowledge of the Arthrodira. As a researcher he was inspired by Johan Kiær, and specialized in ancient fish, conducting paleontological expeditions to Svalbard. In 1939 he published Cephalaspida from Downtonian of Norway, about cephalaspida excavated at Ringerike. He was appointed professor at the University of Oslo and director of the Paleontological Museum in 1940. In 1940 Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany. Open protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the Gestapo arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Johannes Andenæs, Bjørn Føyn, Johan Christian Schreiner, Eiliv Skard, Harald K. Schjelderup, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Anatol Heintz were sent to Grini concentration camp. Heintz was incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 24 December 1944. While at Grini he held numerous popular science lectures for the other inmates. After the war he assumed his positions as professor and director, which he held until retiring in 1966. He was also chairman of Norsk Geologisk Forening from 1945 to 1946, and co-founder and first chairman of Norske naturhistoriske museers landsforbund from 1938 to 1949 and 1958 to 1961. He was also a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and an honorary member of the Geological Society of London. Since 1928 he was married to Mary Solnørdal (1901–1991). Their daughter Natascha Heintz became a notable palaeontologist. Anatol Heintz died in February 1975 in Bærum.

It is published by Dias Ex Machina, featuring the artwork of Nick Greenwood and Jaime Jones. Rules The game uses the Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition rules as a base, altering some of the rules to adapt to the setting and include things like vehicles and guns, making magic less powerful and additionally, it changes many of the ‘core’ classes by opening up new paths of advancement via the class focus system. Additionally the game shares its combat rules with other future supplements of the same publisher and it is meant to be compatible with standard GSL rules.Announcement on EnWorld Races Separating itself further from the ‘classical’ fantasy game are the races playable. The setting focuses on the fact that the majority of the non-human races are fey, ranging from the short Narros (reminiscent of dwarves) to the various races that are far more elven in appearance, to the gnomish Gimfen, and even the vampiric Tilen. Even the demons the characters encounter are descendants of the Fey. Technology and magic The setting also takes into account the disruption of modern technology by magic; the more technologically advanced an item is, the more likely that the Enchantment Disruption Field that encompasses the globe will affect it. Rules in detail are provided for all facets of technological and magical interaction. Other notes Amethyst was originally published under 3.5 rules and recognized with an Honorable Mention for Best Setting in the 2008 Gen Con ENnie Awards.

Only men aged 18–60 at the time of the crime could be executed; women were not subject to the death penalty.Press Release by the United Nations Human Rights Commission, March 22, 2000 The government has since abolished the death penalty for all crimes. According to Amnesty International, Mongolia, like China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore, practiced executions in secrecy.\\"La peine de mort, une pratique entourée de secret\\", Amnesty International, April 15, 2008\\"Condamnations à mort et exécutions recensées en 2007\\" , Amnesty International, April 15, 2008 The family of the prisoner would not be informed of the date of the execution, nor the place of burial. There were 45 people sentenced to death in 2007, but the number of executions was not revealed by the authorities. Five people are thought to have been executed in 2008. Methods Immurement was a historical method still used in the beginning of the 20th century in Mongolia.New Zealand Herald (1914), p.7 The modern method of execution was a bullet to the neck.“Le président mongol veut abolir la peine de mort”, Le Monde, January 14, 2009 Moratorium In June 2009, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, an abolitionist, was elected President of Mongolia. He began using his prerogative of pardon to prevent the application of the death penalty.\\"Mongolie. Un condamné à mort mongol a été gracié\\" , Amnesty International, October 14, 2009 On January 14, 2010, he announced that he would henceforth use his prerogative to pardon all persons sentenced to death. He stated that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and that Mongolia should follow their example; he suggested that it be replaced with a 30-year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in Parliament, a significant number of represesentatives chose not to give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech. Le Monde, however, noted that President Elbegdorj \\"may find it a lot more difficult\\" to have the death penalty abolished in law, adding that it might be applied again if Elbegdorj failed to be reelected. Elbegdorj won the 2013 presidential election on 26 June 2013 and his second presidential term is running from 10 July 2013 to June or July 2017. Abolition On January 5, 2012, \\"a large majority of MPs\\" adopted a bill that aims to abolish the death penalty. After two years under the official moratorium, the State Great Khural formally signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\"Mongolia takes ‘vital step forward’ in abolishing the death penalty\\", Amnesty International, 5 January 2012 This makes Mongolia abolitionist because under Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant, “No one within the jurisdiction of a State Party to the present Protocol shall be executed,” and “Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.” Capital punishment was formally removed from statutes by a 2015 Act, which took effect on July 1, 2016.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-death- penalty-2015_us_57040f0fe4b0daf53af13542 Mongolia is one of the last Eastern Bloc states (not including Eastern Europe) to abolish the death penalty.

It could also refer to a collaboration between professionals and amateurs in a scientific discipline such as astronomy. Overview In reference to individuals, the term also has another meaning: it implies someone that is intermediate, indeterminate or fluctuating between amateur and professional status, an idea more related to the similar socio-economic term \\"amateur professionalism\\". A common synonym for this version of pro-am is semi-professional (semi-pro). Thus has the term proam long had various meanings and significances, depending upon the sport in question. Those who play at a highly competitive and strongly skilled level, but are not paid, are often called pro-ams. The term is also applied to competitors who do get paid in some events (e.g., tournaments with a cash prize) but who do not make a full-time living at the activity. In sports with a highly regulated system of professional qualifications and limitations, it may be applied to competitors whose careers move between professional and amateur status with their performance in any given season or string of seasons. As an adjective, the term may also refer to an open contest or series of contests (e.g., \\"pro-am tournament\\", \\"pro-am tour\\") in which professionals and amateurs compete without distinction; those limited to \\"professional-amateur\\" players and barring full-time pros; or those of a semi-professional or minor league level, short of the top competitive ranks in the sport. Pro–am competition is especially common in golf, and in track and field. Cue sports is another field in which pro-am play is common; an example in the open, mixed-play sense is the International Pool Tour in eight-ball. And in snooker, the International Open Series was a no-pros tour and a proving ground for amateurs aspiring to official pro qualification. Minor League Baseball, and its conceptual equivalents in other sports such as the AHL in North American ice hockey and Conference National play in English football, can also been seen as a form of well-organized pro-am play in the semi-professional sense. There are also a few pro-am tennis events, such as the annual Necker Cup organized by Richard Branson, where tennis pros are invited to compete against amateur enthusiasts. In dance sport, pro–am provides an opportunity for an amateur to take part in competitions with a professional partner. In this case, the teacher is usually also the dance partner. All of the most relevant international dance sport associations, including the World Dance Council, World DanceSport Federation, and International Dance Sport Association, offer pro–am competitions as parts of their international events. The world's oldest dance competition, the Blackpool Dance Festival, featured its first pro–am event in 2014. Chains of franchised pro–am studios, like the Arthur Murray and Fred Astaire studios, are found nationwide in the United States. Pro–am dance sport has also started to break ground in Europe, with studios such as Agens Pro–am (Germany), and ProAm-Tanzen (Austria).

In 1672, during the rule of Alexis of Russia, the first professional theater in Russia was founded here.

The famous toy army of Peter the Great consisting of Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky regiments developed here in the 1680s.

Plot In an alternate Britain, eight mandatory candidates dress for what appears to be an employment assessment exam. The group enter a room and sit at individual desks. Each desk has a paper printed with the word \\"candidate\\" and a number from one to eight. The Invigilator, a representative of the company, DATAPREV, explains that the exam is 80 minutes and consists of only one question, but there are three rules: The candidates must not talk to him or the armed guard at the door, must not spoil their paper, and may not leave the room. If they do, they will be disqualified. The Invigilator asks them if they have any questions, then leaves. As the exam starts, it turns out that the papers are otherwise blank. Within minutes, a Chinese candidate is disqualified for spoiling her paper by writing on it. After her ejection, the seven remaining candidates realise it is permissible to talk to each other and collaborate. One candidate, \\"White,\\" assigns nicknames to each candidate based on hair color and skin colour: Black, Blonde, Brown, Brunette, Dark, and Deaf for one candidate who does not speak or respond to the group. In the hour that follows, the candidates use lights, bodily fluids, and fire sprinklers in attempts to reveal hidden text on their papers, to no avail. They speculate on the exam's purpose and the nature of the company whose identity is shrouded in mystery. Dark claims that the CEO is highly secretive and has not been seen since the IPO. It is gradually revealed that the company is responsible for a miracle drug designed to treat a condition afflicting a large part of the population due to a viral pandemic. In the chaos, White takes control of the group and engineers the disqualifications of Brunette and Deaf for spoiled papers. White also begins taunting the others, saying he has figured out the question but will not tell them. In response, Black punches White in the face, knocking him unconscious, and ties him to a chair. As White passes out, he pleads for his medication, implying he has the virus, but some of them do not believe him. Brown then turns his attention to Dark, who demonstrates a lot of knowledge about the company's internal workings, and eventually tortures her into revealing that she works for the company. It is revealed that Black is a carrier of the disease. White then goes into convulsions, proving he has the disease. Dark pleads to the Invigilator for help and is disqualified. Blonde retrieves the medication for White, which was stolen from him earlier by Brown, and uses it to revive him. The others release White and demand to know the question. White suggests that there is no question and the company will simply hire the last remaining candidate. Black steals the guard's gun, but it requires the guard's fingerprint to fire, giving White time to retrieve it. White forces Brown to leave the room at gunpoint, disqualifying him, then forces Blonde to leave; as she exits the room, Blonde turns off the voice- activated lights, allowing Black to attack White. The lights come back on after Black is struck by a gunshot. Blonde hides in the hallway, still holding one foot inside the room. Before White can kill her, the exam timer runs to zero. White then addresses the Invigilator, sure of his success, but is disqualified. It is revealed that Deaf had earlier set the countdown clock forward by a few minutes. Blonde then remembers that Deaf had been using glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the phrase \\"Question 1.\\" on the exam paper in minuscule writing. Blonde realises that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of the group by the Invigilator at the beginning of the test (\\"Any questions?\\"). Blonde answers \\"No.\\" The Invigilator then enters and reveals that Deaf is actually the CEO of the company and a scientist whose research had found the virus cure, but also discovered a method of rapid cell regeneration capable of curing both the virus and \\"the gift of life\\" for millions of people. The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, reviving him. With the desperate need for the drug and a limited supply, the company needed an administrator capable of good making tough decisions with an attention to detail while showing compassion, all traits that Blonde displayed during the exam. Blonde eagerly accepts the job.

The original story involved an exam at a school, but Stuart Hazeldine changed it to be a job interview. The ending is also Hazeldine's creation, as the original story didn't have one. Hazeldine wanted to separate the characters by race, culture, gender, and, especially, worldview. The film's pandemic was influenced by contemporary fears of bird flu and distrust of pharmaceutical companies. Originally, the script had more science fiction elements, but Hazeldine stripped them out to keep the film grounded. About the twist ending, Hazeldine said he wanted the film to be about more than just the twist, and he tried to appeal to audiences who seek a story about human nature. Release The film premiered in June 2009 as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival and was then part of the Raindance Film Festival 2009. It was released in UK cinemas on 8 January 2010. On 11 February 2010, IFC Films acquired the rights for the US release, where it was released as part of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The DVD and Blu-ray were released in the UK on 7 June 2010. There was no theatrical release in the US, but IFC Films released the film via video on demand on 23 July 2010 and on DVD on 16 November 2010. On 4 September 2012, a stage adaptation of the film opened in Manchester. Reception According to Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of 30 surveyed critics gave it positive reviews; the average rating is 5.6 out of 10. Tim Robey of The Telegraph said that the film starts off well but loses its way. Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it \\"a smartly conceived, tautly executed psychological thriller.\\" Philip French of The Guardian called the film clever and \\"ingeniously developed\\" but criticised the ending as disappointing. Also writing in the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film two out of five stars and said the film does not live up to its intriguing premise. Awarding the film four out of five stars, Total Film compared the film to Cube and the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. Becky Reed of Screen Geek compared it to 12 Angry Men and El Método (The Method), a 2005 Spanish film.

It is a composition of 58 gathas (verses) giving an exposition of the six dravyas (substances) that characterize the Jain view of the world: sentient (jīva), non-sentient (pudgala), principle of motion (dharma), principle of rest (adharma), space (ākāśa) and time (kāla).Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of Introduction It is one of the most important Jain works and has gained widespread popularity. ' has played an important role in Jain education and is often memorized because of its comprehensiveness as well as brevity. Author 10th century Jain Acarya, Nemicandra Siddhānta Cakravartin is regarded as the author of '. He was the teacher of Camundaraya—the general of the Western Ganga Dynasty of Karnataka. Nemicandra was a prolific author and a specialist in summarizing and giving lucidly the essence of teachings in various fields; ' (compendium) and sāras (essence) were his specialty. He also wrote Trilokasāra (essence of cosmology), Labdhisāra (essence of attainments), ' (essence on destruction of karmas), and ' (essence of Gommata, a treatise on soul and Karma). Although not much is known about him from his own works, at the end of the Trilokasāra and of the ', he introduces himself as a pupil of Abhayanandi, Vīranandi, Indranandi and Kanakanandi. He is said to have inspired Camundaraya to build the famous Bāhubali statue at Shravanabelagola. Vahuvali Charitra (a Jain work based on collection of traditions) notes that Nemicandra belonged to the monastic order of Desiya gana. After establishing the statue of Bāhubali, Camundaraya offered villages yielding a revenue of 96,000 gold coins to Nemicandra for daily worship of and festivals for Gommatesvara (Lord Bāhubali).Nemicandra; Brahmadeva, & Ghoshal, Sarat Chandra (1989) pg. xxxviii of introduction Influence English translation by Nalini Balbir ' has played an important role in Jain education and is often memorized because of its comprehensiveness and brevity. The composition of ' is influenced from the earlier Jain works such as Umāsvāti's Tattvārthasūtra and Kundakunda's Pañcāstikāyasara because these works are based on the same topics as the '.Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 2 of Introduction Contents and overview According to Nalini Balbir, the ' is largely a work of definitions of concepts with mnemonic perspective. In its 58 verses, the author makes skillful use of āryā metre. Nemicandra's presentation is often articulated around the opposition between the conventional and the absolute points of view (vyavahāra and niścaya-naya), or around the contrast between the material and the spiritual angles (dravya and bhāva). Sarat Chandra Ghoshal, the translator of ', divides the entire text in three convenient parts—the first part deals with six dravyas (verses 1–27), the second with seven tattvas (verses 28–39) and the third part describes the way to attain liberation (verses 40–57).Nemicandra; Brahmadeva, & Ghoshal, Sarat Chandra (1989) pg. xlv of introduction The six dravyas In tine opening verse, along with the usual mangalacharana (eulogy), it is mentioned that dravya consists of jiva and ajiva. In the second verse Jiva is defined:Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 4 The various characteristics of Jiva mentioned in the definition are taken up one by one in verses 3–14. ' classifies the embodied souls on the basis of the number of senses possessed by it: from one to five senses.Nemicandra; Brahmadeva, & Ghoshal, Sarat Chandra (1989) p.31-32 After this detailed description of Jivas the author proceeds to describe Ajivas—Pudgala, Dharma, adharma, Akasa and Kala, each of which is defined in verses 16–22. Among these, as per verse 23, the Jiva, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and akasa are called astikayas, the extensibles or conglomerates. Tattvas The second part deals with the seven tattvas (fundamental principles or verities): jīva (soul), ajīva (non soul), āsrava (karmic inflow), bandha (bondage of karmas), saṃvara (stoppage of karmas), nirjarā (shedding of karmas) and mokṣa (emancipation or liberation). Together with puṇya (merit or beneficial karma) and pāpa (demerit or harmful karma) they form nine padārtha. Some call all nine as navatattava or nine tattvas.  Moksa  The third part of ' begins with verse 39 describing the means to attain liberation from conventional and real point of views. The three jewels of Jainism also known as Ratnatraya—Samyak darśana (rational perception), samyak jñāna (rational knowledge) and samyak cāritra (rational conduct)—which are essential in achieving liberation—are definedNemicandra; Brahmadeva, & Ghoshal, Sarat Chandra (1989) p. 101Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 20 and the importance of dhyāna (meditation) is emphasized.

He was acknowledged as the first landscape artist to be influenced by the pre-Raphaelites ideas of colour, meticulous observation of the subject, and attention to detail. He was also influenced by the English artist Richard Redgrave. Working in both oils and watercolours, his work became very popular during the late 1850s to early 1860s, though critical reception was mixed with, for example, art critic John Ruskin denying that Warren was a true pre-Raphaelite because his landscapes owed more to \\"cleverly deceptive technique\\" than observation.Also see: John Ruskin.

The tradition of Bixio Publishing Group has roots coinciding with the invention of sound film when founder Cesare Andrea Bixio wrote the soundtrack for the first Italian talking movie, 'La Canzone dell' Amore' (\\"The Song of Love\\") in 1930.Moliterno, Gino. ‘ ‘The A to Z of Italian Cinema’ ‘. Scarecrow Press Inc., 2009, p. 266. The film achieved popularity, not least for the catchy song ‘Solo per tu Lucia’ (“Only for You, Lucia”), especially composed for the film by Cesare Andrea Bixio. The creation of La Canzone dell' Amore signaled the birth of Bixio Publishing Groups' longstanding collaboration with the cinema. A collaboration that throughout decades of filmmaking has resulted in the pairing of musical works of phenomenal composers, such as Lalo Schifrin, Ennio Morricone, Pino Donaggio, and Goblin (band), with culturally influential motion pictures of directors such as Liliana Cavani, Dario Argento and Quentin Tarantino. The progressive electronic rock band Goblin (band) frequently collaborated with writer director Dario Argento. Argento is known primarily as the godfather of giallo and master slasher horror film maker. Goblin created the musical score for a number of Argentos’ films including Profondo Rosso, Suspiria (soundtrack), Tenebrae (film) and most recently in 2000 ‘Non ho Sonno’ or Sleepless. The original soundtracks to these films were all released by the Bixio Publishing Group label Cinevox. The 1977 Argento film Suspiria is currently being remade and is scheduled to be released in 2017. The score 7 Notes in Black, performed by Vince Tempera & Orchestra, is from the original soundtrack released in 1977 for the film ‘Sette Note In Nero’ a.k.a. ‘The Psychic’ starring Jennifer O’Neil and directed by Lucio Fulci. The original score was composed by Franco Bixio, Vincenzo Tempera and Fabio Frizzi. The main theme song from the film ‘7 Note’ was also used in the film ‘Kill Bill 1’ directed by Quentin Tarantino. Evan Lurie worked with Bixios’ Cinevox Records on the original score for the film The Little Devil directed by Roberto Benigni and starring the director himself together with legendary comic Walter Matthau. The song 'Devils Tango' from this original soundtrack was most recently used in the film Silver Linings Playbook. The 1970 film Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion was directed by Elio Petri and was considered one of the best foreign films in the 1970s. The musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone in also in collaboration with Bixios’ Cinevox Records. Bixio Music Group licensed the theme from this film for use in the TV series Chuck.

Because it has the orbit of a main- belt asteroid and showed the tail of a comet, it was listed as a main-belt comet. But within a month of discovery, an analysis of images by the Hubble telescope suggested that its tail was generated by dust and gravel resulting from a recent head-on collision between asteroids rather than from sublimation of cometary ice. This was the first time a small-body collision had been observed; since then, minor planet 596 Scheila has also been seen to undergo a collision, in late 2010. The position of the nucleus was remarkable for being offset from the axis of the tail and outside the dust halo, a situation never before seen in a comet. The tail is created by millimeter-sized particles being pushed back by solar radiation pressure.HST Sees Evidence of Colliding Asteroids, Astronomy Today, Feb.2, 2010  Overview  Orbit of P/2010 A2 at the time of its discoveryP/2010 A2 was discovered on 6 January 2010 by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) using a 1-meter (36\\") reflecting telescope with a CCD camera. It was LINEAR's 193rd comet discovery.Hergenrother, Carl W.; The Curious Case of Comet LINEAR, The Transient Sky, 10 January 2010 (1.8-m telescope on Kitt Peak)Catalogue of Comet Discoveries, Comethunter.de It has been observed over a 112-day arc of the 3.5 year orbit. It appears to have come to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) around the start of December 2009, about a month before it was discovered. With an aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun) of only 2.6 AU, P/2010 A2 spends all of its time inside of the frostline at 2.7 AU. Beyond the frostline volatile ices are generally more common. Early observations did not detect water vapor or other gases. Within less than a month of its discovery it was doubtful that the tail of P/2010 A2 was generated via active outgassing from sublimation of ices hidden beneath the crust. Early modeling indicated that the asteroid became active in late March 2009, reached maximum activity in early June 2009, and eased activity in early December 2009. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and the narrow angle camera on board the Rosetta spacecraft indicate that the dust trail seen was probably created by the impact of a small meter size object on the larger asteroid in February or March 2009, although it cannot be ruled out that the asteroid's rotation increased from solar radiation resulting in a loss of mass that formed a comet-like tail. P/2010 A2 is likely about 150 meters (460 feet) in diameter. Even when it was discovered it was suspected of being less than 500 meters in diameter. Another object, centaur 60558 Echeclus in 2006, was suspected of outgassing as a result of an undetermined splitting event. The orbit of P/2010 A2 is consistent with membership in the Flora asteroid family, produced by collisional shattering more than 100 million years ago. The Flora family of asteroids may be the source of the Chicxulub (Cretaceous–Paleogene) impactor, the likely culprit in the extinction of the dinosaurs. { class=wikitable width=480 valign=topDebris field?350px P/2010 A2 is likely the debris left over from a recent collision between two very small asteroids. valign=topComet nucleus320px Assumed comet nucleus seen to the lower left of debris field } See also * 311P/PANSTARRS Possible asteroid collision events * 596 Scheila * 493 Griseldis  References External links * Orbital simulation from JPL (Java) / Horizons Ephemeris * Image of Comet P/2010 A2 (Muler 12\\" Meade LX200) * Suspected Asteroid Collision Leaves Odd X-Pattern of Trailing Debris (Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 2010 January 29 image) * Hubblesite Videos (January 29 through May 29) * NOAO/WIYN: New Camera at WIYN images an Asteroid with a Long Tail (NOAO 13-07 : 3 June 2013) * Category:Active asteroids Category:Small- asteroids collision # 20100106 ","title":"354P/LINEAR"},{"id":"25803577","text":"Gloucester Services is a pair of Motorway Service Areas (MSA) serving the northbound and southbound carriageways of the M5 between Junction 11A and Junction 12, near Whaddon, Gloucester. It specialises in selling artisanal food, and does not offer outlets for popular chain food brands. Construction of the northbound services began in early 2013, and they officially opened on 7 May 2014. Construction of the southbound services commenced in March 2014 and they opened on 19 May 2015. History In September 2009, the independent motorway services operator Westmorland Motorway Services Ltd, jointly with a local charitable trust, Gloucestershire Gateway Trust, submitted plans for a service area at Matson for public consultation. The plans were for a business operated in a similar manner to Tebay Services on the M6 in Cumbria, with much of the food and produce on sale being sourced from local suppliers. The operator promised not to host chain coffee shops, fast-food outlets, or video and gambling machines. The service area supports the Gloucestershire Gateway Trust in assisting the business to provide good jobs for more deprived areas of Gloucester, and to support local social regeneration schemes. The 2019 Motorway Services User Survey found that Gloucester's southbound side was in the top five motorway services in the UK for customer satisfaction.  Government MSA strategy  Arguments both in support of and opposition to the scheme were made, citing Highways Agency and Department for Transport guidance. A 2008 DfT circular advised a maximum distance or 30 minute drive time, whichever is the lesser, between services on the motorway network. In early 2009, the Highways Agency conducted a review of motorway services in England, guided by this circular, identifying gaps in provision of core motorway service areas. A shortcoming of provision for traffic traversing the Welsh-English border between the M50 terminus and Michaelwood Services was identified.\\"Motorway Service Areas in England\\" Report - Section 4.27 A distance of or greater would be a gap between MSAs above which the Highways Agency would consider informing a local authority of the potential need for a new MSA to be included in the Local Development Framework. The 2008 circular also advised that any development be limited to mitigate the impact on the environment, particularly to National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The site at Ongers Farm is on the boundary of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).  Planning decision  A planning application was submitted to the local Planning Authority, Stroud District Council in December 2009. The application was approved in August 2010, with councillors on the planning committee voting six to four in favour of the scheme. There was opposition to the proposal from groups in the local area, including the Campaign Against Motorway Service Area (CAMSA), with objections mainly based on aesthetic damage to the surrounding countryside (with particular reference to the scheme's proximity to the Cotswolds AONB), and a lack of need. The District Council was informed at the end of February 2011 that Roadchef and Welcome Break (the operators of Strensham and Michaelwood service stations) had applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the Council’s decision to grant planning permission. Joined in the action were CAMSA and the Parish Councils of Brookthorpe-with-Whaddon and Harescombe. The case was heard in the High Court in Birmingham on 17 and 18 January 2012. By 8 February 2012, the High Court had dismissed all challenges to the planning application.Challenge to M5 motorway service area thrown out by High Court , Press Release 8 February 2012, Stroud District Council Green roof Southbound pond seating area One of the factors that helped the development gain planning permission was the inclusion of a green roof in the design. The 4000sqm state-of-the-art green roof was designed to disguise the new service station as part of the landscape. With the Cotswolds on one side and Robinswood Hill on the other, every effort had to be made to reduce the aesthetic and biological impact the project had. A bespoke seed mix was used which was intended to mimic the natural vegetation of the surrounding landscape. Species such as birdsfoot trefoil and yellow rattle were included to attract UK native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

These prints provided visual repertories of classical models for generations of European artists and connoisseurs. Biography Laocoon group. Perrier was born in Pontarlier. During the years 1620–1625, he resided in Rome, where he took as his model the practitioner of academic Baroque classicism, Giovanni Lanfranco while he was employed on the fresco decoration of the dome of S. Andrea della Valle, one of the earliest examples of Roman Baroque ceiling decoration.Celia Alegret, Perrier, François, Grove Art Online On his return to France, following a brief stay in Lyon he settled in Paris in 1630. Here he worked in the classicising circle of Simon Vouet. In 1632–1634, he had as his pupil Charles Le Brun, who would become a central figure of official French painting in the age of Louis XIV. Perrier returned to Rome in 1635, remaining there for the next decade. During this period he created decorations for palazzo Peretti and saw to the publication in Paris of his great repertory of images.

Life He was the youngest son of Richard Beadon (1779–1858), and grandson of Richard Beadon, the bishop of Bath and Wells His mother, Annabella Ashe née à Court (1781–1866) was the daughter of Sir William à Court 1st Baronet à Court of Heytesbury; and sister of William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury. Cecil was educated at Eton College and Shrewsbury School. At the age of eighteen he was presented with an appointment to the Bengal civil service, which had been placed by the court of directors at the disposal of his uncle Lord Heytesbury, nominated as Governor-General of India in 1835 (by Robert Peel, but the nomination was cancelled by the fall of Peel's administration). Reaching India in 1836, Beadon spent time in district offices administration, and was serving as magistrate of Murshidabad when in 1843 he was appointed under-secretary to the government of Bengal. From that time his promotion was rapid. After filling posts in the revenue administration, he was selected in 1850 by James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie to represent the Bengal presidency on a commission on the postal system. He then held in succession the posts of secretary to the government of Bengal, secretary to the government of India in the home department, foreign secretary, member of the council of the governor- general (1860–2), and finally that of lieutenant-governor of Bengal (1862–6). He was backed by three Governors-General, Hardinge, Dalhousie who consulted him on internal administration, and Canning. During most of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Beadon was home secretary. In Bengal, measures Beadon implemented in the Assam tea trade were held to have caused a slump, and the mission of Ashley Eden to Bhutan went badly, and was followed by the Bhutan war. The Orissa famine of 1866 found him absent from Calcutta for health reasons. The Governor-General, Sir John Lawrence did not overrule Beadon's view of the famine. The report of a commission of inquiry on the handling of the famine was unfavourable to Beadon, who left India and returned to England. He died on 18 July 1880 in his sixty-fifth year. Orissa Famine During the Orissa Famine of 1866, he did nothing to alleviate deaths from famine, as he was concerned about tampering with the natural laws of economics. He remarked that \\"Such visitations of providence as these no government can do much either to prevent or alleviate,\\" and that if he attempted to alleviate deaths from famine, he would consider himself \\"no better than a dacoit or thief.\\" He maintained this viewpoint in spite of the fact that India exported over 200 million pounds of rice to Britain during the period of famine. Family In 1837 he married firstly Harriet Sneyd (1818–1855) daughter of Major Ralph Henry Sneyd (1784–1840) of the Bengal cavalry, with whom he had ten children; and in 1860 he married secondly Agnes Stendale (1836–1906), daughter of William Handley Sterndale (1791–1866) and brother of Robert Armitage Sterndale, with whom he had ten more.

Touch guitars are meant to be touched or tapped, not strummed. History The touch or tapping technique was formally codified by American guitarist Jimmie Webster in his 1952 method book called the Illustrated Touch System. Dave Bunker playing a double-neck touch guitar Webster credited pickup designer Harry DeArmond with first demonstrating the potential for touch-style playing. Webster himself collaborated with Gretsch Guitars on a guitar stereo pickup design for the Touch System (which fed the bass and melody output to two separate amplifiers), but the concept was not commercially successful. Unlike Webster’s approach, which was to play on a single-necked instrument, guitarist and luthier Dave Bunker designed, built, and patented (in 1961) the first double- necked, headless, touch-tapping instrument called the DuoLectar. While both guitars employed a two-handed tappingtechnique, Webster used a single-necked instrument while Bunker used his double-necked DuoLectar guitar. Webster's tapping technique can be heard on a 1959 record. In 1960, Bunker first demonstrated his double-necked instrument for the Portland Oregonian newspaper, and then on the nationally broadcast television show Ozark Jubilee. His designs ultimately led to his double-necked touch guitar in 1975. Other designs followed. Among them was the single-neck Chapman Stick (developed by Emmett Chapman in 1970 and produced in 1974), the single-neck Warr Guitar (first produced in 1991) and the single-neck Mobius Megatar. Other touch guitars have included the Solene, Chuck Soupios's dual-necked BiAxe (patented in 1980 and produced during the early 1980s), and Sergio Santucci's TrebleBass. Stanley Jordan playing a single-neck touch guitar Merle Travis occasionally used a tapping style on his single-neck, strummed guitar, as did Roy Smeck, George Van Eps, Barney Kessel and Harvey Mandell. Subsequent years have seen Eddie Van Halen, Stanley Jordan, Steve Vai, Jeff Healey, and Markus Reuter all feature the use of tapping techniques.

The mortar was designed by Robert Mallet and was constructed in separate sections so that it could be transported. Robert Mallet first made his design public in 1854. There was little response from the authorities until Mallet wrote to the then Prime Minister Lord Palmerston in March 1855. Palmerston was taken with the idea and instructed the Board of Ordnance to arrange for the construction of two mortars of Mallet's design. Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company won the contract at a price of £4,300 per mortar. The company's bankruptcy resulted in the work being divided among three firms which managed to deliver the mortars in May 1857. Testing began on 19 October 1857 with further testing on 18 December 1857, 21 July 1858 and 28 of July 1858. Each test was brought to an end by damage to the mortar. A total of 19 rounds were fired with a rate of about 4 shells an hour being achieved. Shell weight was between . In testing with an charge it fired the lighter shell a distance of with a flight time of 23 seconds. Both mortars are in the collection of the Royal Armouries, the UK's national museum of arms and armour.

The original frequency of 1503 kHz was later replaced by the better-received 1494 kHz. Jingles used on the station included a specially-commissioned package recorded by the singers at Pams of Dallas, who provided the jingles used by the offshore pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London in the 1960s. Sovereign's music format was unique in that it was quite usual to hear three records in a row by a major band or artist. Many rare and seldom heard-oldies were also played. News was broadcast at half past each hour, followed by a current Top Forty contender, which was the exception to the Solid Gold format; these records were known as 'Future Gold' records. Radio Sovereign operated from 3 Sherland Road, Twickenham. The on-air address was announced as 'Radio Sovereign, Surbiton'. However, no broadcasts were ever made from Surbiton! After closing in the UK, the station moved to Camporosso, Italy, in May 1984 under the name Radio Sovereign International. The station is named \\"88.4 – The Rock of the Riviera\\".

It is a primary freshwater fish originally from Java island of Indonesia. It is known as Wader pari fish in Indonesian language. In addition, it is protein source for the local community during the old days. The taxonomy, phylogeny, and distributional boundary have not been fully studied yet.  Distribution  The species can be found in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and the United States. The distribution is pretty reliable according to their Genus distribution in which they are native to freshwater habitats in South, Southeast Asia, and southeast China. However, a journal had stated that R. lateristriata had a west-to-east direction of divergence and migration from Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene. R. lateristriata is often considered to be widely distributed from Sumatra, Java, Bali, across Wallace's Line, to Lombok and Sumbawa Islands of Indonesia (e.g., Froese and Pauly, 2015).  Habitat and feeding habit It is a type of riverine fish found in mountainous streams that is in shallow area with relatively fast flowing water and plenty of gravel in river bottom. The fish is an omnivorous feeder which feeds on phytoplankton, zooplankton, insect larva, leaf cut, and little caterpillar day and night continuously. It is hunted down by snake head and red devil fish in the natural ecosystem.  Spawning site  The requirement for the spawning site is to have clean water flows smoothly, shallow, available enough of sand and gravel, and no garbage around them. Depth of the spawning site is about 30 cm. Artificial induced spawning is unknown.  Morphology  Dorsal spines (total): 2; Dorsal soft rays (total): 7; Anal spines: 3; Anal soft rays: 5. Preserved color dark brown dorsally, whitish to yellowish on sides and below; scales margined with minute dark spots; opercle with silvery black spot. 12 scales between nape and dorsal. Mouth strongly oblique with anterior end as high as upper margin of pupil; maxillary extends posteriorly below anterior margin of eye. Lateral line complete, reaching caudal, with 7 rows of scales between lateral lines over middle of caudal peduncle.  Incident  The eruption of Kelud Volcano on February 13, 2014, which released a huge amount of volcanic dust and nearly covered the whole of Java island possibly changed the fish. As a result, the exposure of fish to the volcanic dust which naturally dissolves on the water body, affected and caused change on the histological structure of gills and intestine, but did not have an effect on the histological structure of eyes, liver and gonad of the wader pari fish, respectively.  Current status  R. lateristriata is at vulnerable according to IUCN Red List and the population is declining with numbers from 10,000 to 100,000 mature individuals. The original habitat which used to be moderately abundant is becoming rare which leads to less opportunity for a researcher to do sampling. The declining population trend was probably caused by declining and inconsistent rainfall.

The Railway Line was built by the Tasmanian Main Line Company. The route of the railway travels some reasonably poor topography, particularly in the southern section. History When building the railway Line the company had limited finances, the line was built to the Narrow Gauge and included long sections of steep gradients and sharp curves. The final eighteen kilometres of the route from Western Junction to Launceston used the existing Broad gauge alignment of the Launceston and Western Railway, with a third rail being laid for use by the narrow gauge trains. The Railway Line was officially opened on 1 November 1876. As Tasmania has a very competitive Road Transport industry and a modern road network, only limited deviations have been built in the Main line's 125-year history. Although the line still follows the original alignment, the standard of the track has improved by the use of heavier rail welded into long lengths, steel sleepers and better ballast. The line remains in service, and sees multiple freight trains most days, these generally operating Burnie to Boyer and Burnie / Launceston to Hobart and return. The last freight train left Hobart on 22 June 2014, with the service being relocated to the purpose-built Brighton Transport Hub. Route The line commences at the Hobart intermodal Terminal at Maquarie Point, on Hobart's waterfront. The line follows the western side of the River Derwent to Bridgewater, where the river is crossed by the Bridgewater Bridge. From here the line runs generally north east though easy country to Rekuna (between Tea Tree and Campania). From here the often steep and/or twisty climb commences, with little respite for train crews until Rhyndaston and its 1200m long tunnel is passed, some 28 km later. The descent from near Parattah is not as steep or severe as its southern counterpart, although does still include a number of difficult sections including the Tin Dish and Nala deviations which were constructed in the 1930s to lessen gradients, although at the expense of more additional curvature in some sections. North of Antill Ponds, the line roughly parallels the Midland Highway as they both follow the agriculturally rich valley's formed by the Macquarie and South Esk rivers. The South Line finishes at Western Junction near Evandale, where it connects with the Western Line. Future Since the completion of the Brighton Transport Hub, the section of rail line through inner Hobart has fallen into disuse. Serious constraints in the road network, along with low-frequency bus services, have led to ongoing discussion of introducing light rail to Hobart.Waterhouse, Charles: Bid for trams back on track, The Mercury, 9 August 2010. It would make use of the rail corridor, creating a new express route to Hobart. The proposed light rail system is known as both Riverline and the Northern Suburbs Railway.

Particularly applicable to satellite TV distribution systems in a multi-dwelling unit, such as a block of flats (but useful in smaller domestic distribution systems too), such a hybrid fibre/electrical system reduces the cabling required, reduces signal noise and interference, and provides for an easy upgrade to increase the number of tuners connected at each dwelling.\\"Giving co-ax the axe\\" What Satellite & Digital TV (April, 2009) p130-131 Conventional systems that distribute the electrical satellite IF signal via a star network of coaxial cable require one relatively short cable run from the central distribution equipment to each tuner connected to the system, whereas in a fibre system, cables can be very long, and split at successive locations, in a tree structure without detriment to the reception. Advantages The primary benefit of using optical fibre for a satellite TV IF distribution system is that the fibre can carry the entire received spectrum on one cable, which can then be split to provide for multiple tuners, without requiring a separate feed from the antenna to each tuner. Additional outlets can be added to increase the number of receivers within one home without accessing the central antenna or main infrastructure. Fibre cable is cheap in long run, retailing at about twice the price of equivalent copper coaxial cable, but replacing four runs of coaxial cable with a single fibre cable. It is also much smaller than the coaxial signal cable used for electrical IF distribution, but robust and flexible. The losses in a fibre system are almost negligible so very long cable runs of hundreds of metres are possible without any signal reinforcement. Because the signal is carried as a beam of light, it is impervious to the electrical interference that even the best coaxial satellite cable may suffer, and cables can be safely and conveniently run alongside mains power cables. Power consumption is also lower than an equivalent electrical system. SAT Fibre Optics Triax. May 2016 Retrieved October 27, 2017 Global Invacom Optical LNB: The Satellite Reception Revolution Tele-Satellite August 2009 Retrieved December 31, 2016 Development An eight-way optical signal splitter to feed eight virtual LNBs or further splitters from a single optical feed While optical fibre has been used for telephone and Internet backbone data, and even for television and multimedia carriage for terrestrial cable, for many years, use for satellite IF distribution has been held back by considerations of cost and installation convenience. However, since about 2007, UK company, Global Invacom (which also markets domestic and communal satellite reception and distribution equipment, including SCR single cable distribution equipment) has developed a low cost standardised system of optical fibre distribution suitable for domestic installations and small or medium commercial communal dish systems. The development was assisted by Astra satellite operator SES both with advice and financial support in the form of the prize for the Astra Innovation Contest run by Astra in 2007, which Global Invacom won for the proposal and initial development of optical fibre distribution systems for satellite TV.  How it works  A virtual LNB with four electrical outputs for four tuners The complete spectrum of Ku-band satellite reception stretches from 10.70 GHz-12.75 GHz across two signal polarisations, or a bandwidth of about 4000 MHz. This cannot be carried on a single coaxial cable and so in a conventional satellite reception system, just one of four sub-bands (received in vertical and horizontal polarization, and high and low frequency,) is sent from the antenna to the indoor receiver as 0.95 GHz-2.15 GHz IF. Which sub- band is required is signalled from the receiver to the antenna’s LNB by a 13/18V and 0/22 kHz tone on the LNB supply sent up the same coaxial cable. In a single antenna distribution system, special quattro LNB supplies all four sub-bands at once, from four outputs and these are supplied as required to each of the multiple outlets connected to an IF multiswitch.Bains, Geoff. \\"Installing Home IF Distribution\\" What Satellite & Digital TV (June, 2007) p47-51 In an optical fibre system at the LNB the four sub-bands are \\"stacked\\" in frequency, one above the other, at 0.95 GHz-3.0 GHz (the whole frequency range received in vertical polarisation) and 3.4 GHz-5.45 GHz (horizontal polarisation) and transmitted together as a modulated optical signal down the fibre cable using a 1310 nm semiconductor laser. The losses in the cable are extremely small (in the region of 0.3dB/km) and the Global Invacom optical LNB output can be split up to 32 ways with a cable length of up to 10 km between the LNB and the receiver. At, or near, the receiver, the optical signal is converted back to the traditional electrical signal with a virtual multiswitch, providing one or more outputs that “appear” to the receiver as a conventional LNB. Practical considerations A 1m optical fibre cable with fitted connectors for other fibre distribution equipment Although the hybrid optical fibre/electrical system provides many advantages over electrical IF distribution to widespread or complex systems, it also requires a new approach by installers familiar only with electrical installations. The single mode fibre cables use an 8μm fibre armoured with a steel wrap and Kevlar strands inside a plastic jacket. Fibre cable cannot be easily joined (an expensive fusion splicer is required for reliable joints) but pre-made cables with FC type screw-on connectors (mechanically similar in use, but smaller, to the F-connectors used for electrical satellite IF) are available in lengths from 1m to 100m. The same connectors are used on all the optical components of a system, including the optical LNB, splitters, cable joiners, virtual LNB units, etc. The cables must be properly prepared (the end of the fibre itself cleaned) before connections are made and provision must be made to attenuate the LNB signal, to avoid overloading the receiver, if it is not split between receivers as there is so little attenuation inherent in the cable. The optical LNB requires two cables connected – the fibre signal cable and a separate F-connector cable to supply the 12V supply to power the LNB electronics. If the installation is a conversion from an electrical system to fibre, an existing redundant coaxial signal cable can be used for the power supply.

Description Rasbora sarawakensis males reach a maximum standard length of 4.5 cm. It is a relatively stout bodied Rasbora with a large, pointed head. It has a golden ground colour with orange fins and blue longititudinal stripe. The less colourful females are normally larger and more pot-bellied than the more highly coloured males.These fish are usually found in schools of 7 to 12 or more. Distribution Rasbora sarawakensis is endemic to Borneo, occurring in both the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the Indonesia province of Kalimantan Barat. Within its range it has from many river systems including the Batang Kayan and Sungai Sarawak in Sarawak and the Mempawah and Melawi in Kalimantan Barat. Habitat Rasbora sarawakensis occurs in rather sluggish flowing forest streams, with dense emergent vegetation, often lying within the shade of the rainforest canopy. The bed of these streams is normally made up of a thick layer of silt which is covered with fallen tree limbs and leaf litter, the water is usually relatively clear but has a pale brown color from the tannins released by the organic matter that has fallen into the stream as it decomposes. Biology The diet of Rasbora sarawakensis is not known but like its congeners it probably feeds on both aquatic invertebrates and on terrestrial invertebrates which fall into the water. It is a sociable fish living in schools where the brighter males display with each other to attract females It is thought that its breeding behaviour is similar to other rasboras in that it is a continuous egg- scattering fish which does not demonstrate any parental care. Aquariums Rasbora sarwakensis is not common in the aquarium trade but it is an attractive and sociable species which can be found for sale imported from Borneo.

It is notable as the main site of the infamous Lemberg Ghetto. The name of the modern borough comes from the original village that was founded there in 1423 on German law. The right to locate a village there was granted to certain Stechar and Johann Sommerstein. The latter gave his name to the settlement of Sommersteinshof. With time the name got polonized to Zamarstynów, a name that ultimately became also ruthenized (ukrainianized) to the modern \\"Zamarstyniv\\". Until the 16th century the village belonged to the city of Lviv (then called Lwów) as one of its suburbs. It was not until 1615 that the city finally repaid its debts and Zamarstyniv once again became municipal property. Surrounded by rich turf deposits, Zamarstyniv also provided the nearby city with wood, fruits and vegetables. However, it was pawned to one of the burghers (Zebald Worcel), who in turn sold it in 1567 to Mikołaj Sieniawski, a notable member of the Polish- Lithuanian gentry, magnate and the Field Hetman of the Polish Crown. On February 11, 1695 the village was pillaged by the Tartars, who burnt to the ground a local manor belonging to one of Lviv's counsellors Dominik Wilczek. Following the partitions of Poland the village, along with the rest of Galicia, became part of Austria-Hungary. By then the demand for turf dwindled and Zamarstyniv's residents became impoverished. No longer able to provide the town with goods, the village was sold into private hands in the early 19th century. Since then the settlement grew to become a residential suburb. In 1890 it had 3,379 inhabitants, including 3,257 Poles, 47 Germans and 44 Ukrainians. During the Battle of Lviv of 1918 heavy fighting between Polish and Ukrainian forces took place in the vicinity of the suburb. The village ultimately ended up in Polish hands. It continued to grow and by the mid-1920s it had almost 12,000 inhabitants, including 6000 Poles, 3500 Jews and 2500 Ukrainians. Finally in 1930, it was directly incorporated into the nearby city of Lviv as one of its boroughs. Despite the population boom, the suburb retained its reputation of a borough of criminals and paupers for the rest of the 1930s. Out of newly erected buildings only three were worth being mentioned in a 1937 guide to Lviv: the Greek Catholic St. Paraskeva's church, the Roman Catholic St. Martin's church and a J. A. Baczewski vodka and liquor factory built there. Between 1934 and 1939, a large primary school was built there, as well as a large swimming pool. Around that time, the Polish Army also built a central military prison for south-eastern Poland, which was later converted by Soviets into a political prison. Following the Soviet takeover of the city of Lviv after the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the invasion of Poland of 1939, the Soviets organised a political prison in Zamarstyniv. After the start of the German-Soviet war most of its inmates were murdered by the retreating NKVD. Following the German takeover of the city in 1941 a Jewish Ghetto was organised there. Out of more than 130,000 Jews incarcerated there, most were ultimately deported to concentration camps at Bełżec and Janów Lubelski and by 1943 the ghetto was completely liquidated. After the war, the city became part of Ukrainian SSR and the Zamarstyniv suburb was rebuilt, this time mostly as an industrial area with some residential functions retained by the southern part of the borough. Since 1991, it has been a part of independent Ukraine.

To broaden its activities TRKL is reconstituted as Kerala Tourism Infrastructure and Investment Company Ltd by the Government of Kerala.  Administration  TRKL was separated from KTDC in 1989, as an independent company. A 1005 government owned enterprise, the company is managed by Managing Director, who reports to Chairman. The Government Secretary to Tourism Department, is the ex-officio Chairman of TRKL. The current Chairman is Dr.Venu IAS and Managing Director is T.K Manzoor. There are 3 nominated directors in the Board of Directors. The Government Secretary of Finance, Director of Kerala Tourism and Managing Director of KTDC are other members in the board. TRKL Activities The range of activities conducted by TRKL can be broadly divided into three.  Joint Venture Partnerships  The primary function of the company is to develop public-private partnership (PPP model) projects for tourism infrastructure development. Taj Kerala Hotels and Resorts is a joint venture between TRKL and Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces under the PPP model. TRKL announced its latest PPP model project, an urban entertainment centre at Veli, Thiruvananthapuram. This particular project will contribute significantly to the tourism development of the capital city and Kerala as a whole. = TRKL-Taj JV = A pioneer in India in forging joint venture relationships with private sector, TRKL has floated joint ventures with Taj group. The joint venture company Taj Kerala Hotels and Resorts Ltd has developed the following Resort/Star Hotel projects in TRKL's properties. TAJ Garden Retreat Varkala TAJ Garden Retreat Kumarakom Located next to the Vembanad lake and a bird sanctuary, the Taj Garden Retreat Kumarakom is 14 km from Kottayam, and is accessible by both land and water. Gateway Ernakulam Taj Residency Ernakulam is located on Marine Drive.  PPP Venture  TRKL envisages developing tourism based projects on PPP Model, utilizing idle land owned by the Government in locations having tourism potential. One of the first project, identified is development of Veli Urban Entertainment Center with an amusement park, recreational hub and cultural museum.<>http://www.trkl.in/ppp_veli.php<> In addition, TRKL have already partnered with Kerala Tourism for constructing mega International Convention Center at Akkulam in Thiruvananthapuram, along with Mumbai-based Raheja Group. Apart from it, TRKL is planning to start similar International Convention Center facility in Kochi in PPP Model.  RE - NRK partnership  TRKL developed an initiative wherein a platform for interaction between resident entrepreneurs(RE) and non-resident Keralites (NRK's) were developed to promote investment in the sector.  Government projects  TRKL worked as implementing agency for government projects like Sarovaram Bio Park, Thalassery Heritage Tourism Circuit Development, and the Thali Project. * Sarovaram Bio Park is an eco-tourism initiative by Government of Kerala. The bio park which was earlier known as dream city is located a Kozhikode district of Kerala. The project is executed after taking into consideration the environmental aspects. The park is located in an ecosystem consisting of Canoly Canal, wet lands, mangrove, bird habitat etc. * Thalaserry Circuit, consisting of an Overburrys folly with View tower, walkway etc., a sea-view park, a pathway connecting Overburrys folly and sea-view children's park and a municipal park with recreation and cafes, located near Thalassery Fort, a prominent tourist location. http://www.trkl.in/gop_heritage.php * Thali Temple Conservation Project, Kozhikode is one of the ancient Siva Temples in Kerala dating back to the days of the Zamorin's rule. The temple with its well balanced combination of wood and laterate in construction is considered as one of the icons of the cultural heritage of Kerala, especially the Malabar region. This project envisages conservation of this historic structure and its surroundings. It includes renovation of the temple pond, Altharas and surroundings.  SAPARYA  Synergizing Actions through Participatory Approach, abbreviated as SAPARYA is the latest offering of TRKL in developing community based tourist projects, in which larger community invest together with TRKL in developing ecological sustainable community initiatives. The pilot project will be implemented in four districts: Kasaragod (Bekal, Valiyaparamba region), Kannur (Meenkunnu Beach, Thalassery region), Kottayam (Kumarakom, Aimanam region) and Pathanamthitta (Aranmula, Konni region). Gradually the project would be extended to other parts of the State. The project would address issues such as unregulated development, inadequate local benefits, social perception among common people towards tourism, degeneration of culture and heritage and increasing environmental impact. It would create tourism linkages and augment potential for various sectors like agriculture, fisheries, traditional industry, people and lifestyle and heritage. Touted as the first of its kind, this project aims in developing local economy and exposing to outside people without disturbing local environment and local customs and heritages.

Background The song, which describes a partner's commitment to a relationship despite having moments of difficulty, was written by Rae immediately after an argument with her late husband Jason Rae in January 2008. She stated in an interview with The Observers Sean O'Hagan that \\"It was written literally just after me and Jason had this massive disagreement, a big argument, a bad one. Almost as he was leaving the room, I just sat down and wrote it. It's just about how I felt about him at that time. Even right in the middle of the worst times, I remember thinking that I would choose this exact life again, that I would do it all again. It was me saying, I'm not wishing myself out of this situation. I'm 100 percent committed to this person. I don't have any regrets about this relationship even though there are all these difficult times.\\"O'Hagan, Sean. Corinne Bailey Rae: 'It happened to me. It could happen to anyone at any time'. The Observer. Retrieved on 2010-02-07. Bailey Rae told The Sun: \\"There's a line in there that love is bigger than your pride and that's how I felt about him. No one was more right for me than him. No one.\\" Meanwhile, in terms of musically choosing 'I'd Do It All Again' as her first single in three years, she told noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: \\"I felt it was a good way to re-introduce myself to people. Because it just starts with me playing my guitar and singing, but then all the different layers come in. And I really like the fact that it grows and swells to just one chorus, and then it retreats again. You know, it follows an unusual song form, and I felt it was an honest and raw song about love when things are difficult.\\" Music video The music video was directed by Jamie Thraves. Corinne Bailey Rae had been familiar with Thraves previous music videos, calling them \\"very real looking, cinematic and quite dark\\", according to Thraves. She asked for the same concept for her own music video. Jamie Thraves shot the video in East Dulwich, a southern district of London, England. It begins with Rae awaking somberly in bed while singing the first few lines of the song. She is then shown in front of a mirror dabbing lightly at her cheek with a make-up brush before exiting for a walk outside. The video then cuts to Rae buying groceries, walking through a dimly lit subway, and then up a flight of stairs crowded with people who Rae has to weed through to get to her destination. The sequence of events repeats until the climax of the song where Rae breaks through the crowd of people and instead of awaking again in her bed. She tosses off her jacket and sings in front of moving traffic. Rae then runs into an alley where she stops to catch her breath. After this scene, the cycle of awaking in bed, fixing her make-up, buying groceries and so on, continues for the rest of the video. Director Jamie Thraves said of the video's concept, \\"When I first heard the song I instantly saw her doing everyday things, shopping in a supermarket, walking through a park etc but always singing in an intimate fashion.\\" He continues to say \\"We agreed that the song had a sad beginning, a hopeful middle and a sad ending, so that's what we aimed for with the visuals. She saw herself running at some point, so that inspired the running down the alleyway and gave me the idea of her walking in front of traffic. We both saw that moment as a great release in the video.\\" Promotion Rae performed her song live at the Dutch TV show X De Leeuw on March 13.

His studies and legal constructions deeply influenced the law in several countries. Activities In 1897 he was police of Italian government at the International Congress in Brussels about protection of the industrial property and in 1899 advisor on diplomatic conflicts by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1899 he was advisor on diplomatic conflicts to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affair Elected senator in 1900, he was an ordinary member of the Standing Committee of the Superior Court of Justice and member of the Turin National Academy of Sciences. Works on brazilian law In 1911, while he was an associate professor at the University of Pisa, he defended the name \\"promise of contract\\" to refer to prior commitment mutually agreed between the parties that celebrate a contract. This position was reflected immediately in the coming Brazilian Civil Code of 1916 and remained in the review of Brazilian Civil Code in 2002. Gabba left behind the concept of legal principle acquired right, in his most famous book Teoria della retroattività delle leggi (Theory of retroactive legislation, Turin, 1891). For him, acquired right is \\"every right that: : 1) is consequence of the fact suitable to produce it, under the law of the time in which he was held, although opportunity to assert it was not given prior to the performance of the new law regarding the same fact; : 2) under the law under which there was the fact that where it originated, came from the outset to integrate the heritage of those who acquired it. \\"(a originally only patrimonial concept still mainly accepted).\\" Major works *Commemorazione di Maria Gaetana Agnesi.

Originally published in 2003, it was reissued in 2004 under the new title The Abolition of Liberty. The book was described in 2012 by The American Conservative magazine as \\"a must-read for anyone on either side of the Atlantic\\". Themes The book challenges a number of commonly held views about the causes of crime, criticising the opinion that crime is caused by poverty or other forms of social deprivation. It also charts the changes in policing from the 1960s to the present day, and examines and criticises the workings of the modern British prison system, including a chapter on the author's visit to Wormwood Scrubs. Hitchens contends that the former principle of \\"due punishment of responsible persons\\" has been abandoned in favour of vague modern theories of rehabilitation. Reception Left-leaning publications were very critical of the book. David Rose in The Observer described the book as \\"a churning, ceaseless rant, akin to the wake of a cross-Channel ferry. It has similar bilious effects\\" and questioned whether the desperate situation described by Hitchens really exists, citing Oxford as an example. Conservative newspapers assessed the book more favourably. Bryan Appleyard, writing in The Sunday Times, described it as \\"a marvellous, angry polemic\\" that accounts for and charts how the British Police force became so \\"institutionally bureaucratic, sullen, chippy and ineffectual\\". In The Sunday Telegraph, Theodore Dalrymple agreed with the main arguments in the book, writing \\"Mr Hitchens places the blame firmly where it belongs: on a supine and pusillanimous political establishment that, for four decades at least, has constantly retreated before the verbal onslaught of liberal intellectuals whose weapons have been mockery allied to sentimental guilt about their prosperous and comfortable lives, and whose aim has been to liberate themselves from personally irksome moral constraints, without regard to the consequences for those less favourably placed in society\\". Publishing history The book was published by Atlantic Books, () in 2003. An updated edition, re-titled The Abolition of Liberty: The Decline of Order and Justice in England () and featuring a new chapter on identity cards (\\"Your papers, please\\"), and with two chapters – on gun control (\\"Out of the barrel of a gun\\") and capital punishment (\\"Cruel and unusual\\") – removed, appeared in April 2004. Hitchens said in his weblog in 2010 that the reason for removing the above chapters was so that the book \\"would be read more widely\\". Hitchens wrote in 2012 that the chapter 'Out of the Barrel of a Gun’ \\"enraged so many people that I took it out of the paperback version ‘The Abolition of Liberty’ in the vain hope that the book would then get the attention it deserved. A silly delusion. I now wish I hadn't\\". The deleted chapters are restored in the audiobook.

The fort is about 1 kilometre outside the Thiers Wall, built by the same program in response to a perception that Paris was vulnerable to invasion and occupation. The fort was upgraded in the 1870s, to cope with improvements in artillery performance as part of the Séré de Rivières system. In 1946, the fort was vacated by the garrison. It is now the home of the Communication and Audiovisual Production Company for the Department of Defense (Établissement de communication et de production audiovisuelle de la Défense, E.C.P.A.D.). Description Fort d'Ivry dominates a crossroads just to the north of the fort, one of the major approaches to Paris leading to the Porte d'Ivry in the Thiers wall. The pentagonal fort has bastions at each of its five points. The original construction is in stone, with rough stone for the majority of exterior surfaces and dressed stone for accents, gates and window surrounds. A ditch, which still exists on three sides, lies outside the walls. One side of the fort's wall is pierced with 18 casemates, while the others have a parapet shielding a covered walkway. Casemates are also cut into the flanks of the bastions to provide covering fire along the length of the main walls. Three wells provide water. A central parade ground is flanked by a barracks and two officers' residences. The main gate is complemented by three postern gates. The fort includes more than two kilometers of underground passages added between 1852 and 1860, with ceilings six meters thick. The fort was upgraded after the Franco-Prussian War as part of the Séré de Rivières program. A police barracks now occupies the former ditch on the west side, while a variety of buildings occupy the former glacis. The former casemates, barracks and magazine have been redeveloped as offices. History During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870-71 the fort was manned by a Fusiliers Marins battalion from Brest, commanded by naval Captain Krantz. It was equipped with 94 artillery pieces. On 29 and 30 November 1870, the fort supported attacks against the 6th Prussian Corps, located north of Choisy-le-Roi, Thiais and Chevilly-la-Rue. Following an armistice, the fort was occupied by the 6th Prussian Corps from 29 January to 20 March 1871, bringing batteries of 21 cm and 15 cm mortars to fire at Paris in the event of resumed hostilities. During the Paris Commune, which ensued after the withdrawal of the Prussians, the fort was occupied by local townspeople under the leadership of Colonel Rogowski. The Communards were threatened with attack by the French government's 3rd Versailles Corps and evacuated the fort during the night of 24/25 May, blowing up munitions and destroying nine casemates. Repairs were made in 1872, adding two more barracks. Roger Degueldre, chief of the Commando Delta organization of the Organisation armée secrète, was executed by firing squad at the Fort d'Ivry on 6 July 1962. Jean Bastien-Thiry, found guilty of organizing an assassination attempt against French president Charles de Gaulle on 22 August 1962, was executed at the Fort d'Ivry on 11 March 1963. Bastien- Thiry's was the last execution by firing squad in France.

Founded in 2006, the group’s work is centered on three activities: exhibitions, books and lecture performances. History and Work Slavs and Tatars' exhibitions, books, printed matter and lecture-performances draw upon the stylistic palette of popular culture, spiritual and esoteric traditions, oral histories, modern myths, as well as scholarly research. Nicholas Cullinan in Artforum describes Slavs and Tatars as \\"the most cosmopolitan of collectives, where a geopolitics of globe- trotting allows their shape-shifting projects and concerns to continuously cross-pollinate divergent, and sometimes diametrically opposed, cultural specificities.” The artists’ work can be organized according to cycles of research, each on a different theme or topic, from alphabet politics (Language Arts), to medieval advice literature (Mirrors for Princes) to an investigation of syncretism (Not Moscow Not Mecca). H.G. Masters in Asia Art Pacific writes: \\"Beginning with the collective’s name, everything related to Slavs and Tatars is about building connections between seemingly disparate subjects—whether places, histories or ideologies.\\" An important feature of their multi- disciplinary work is the resolution of antitheses or what the artists call the \\"metaphysical splits.” \\"The push and pull of competing ideologies (Sufism and communism), iconographies (sacred and profane) and functionalities (useful and useless) drawn from Eurasian traditions are condensed into polemical statements or objects, each one the conceptual equivalent of that hypothetical gymnast’s body.” Exhibitions=Solo exhibitions Slavs and Tatars' most notable solo exhibitions include: *Slavs and Tatars, Projects 98, Museum of Modern Art, NY, 2012 *Slavs and Tatars, Not Moscow Not Mecca, Vienna Secession, 2012 *Slavs and Tatars, Friendship of Nations: Polish Shi’ite Showbiz, REDCAT, Los Angeles *Slavs and Tatars, Mirrors for Princes, Kunsthalle Zürich, 2014 *Slavs and Tatars, Concentrations 57, Dallas Museum of Art, 2014 *Slavs and Tatars, Mouth to Mouth, CCA Ujazdowski, 2017 *Slavs and Tatars, Nose to Nose, Argo Factory, 2017 *Slavs and Tatars, Made in Dschermany, Albertinum, Dresden, 2018 Slavs and Tatars, Mother Tongues and Father Throats, 2012.

The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010. By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000\\"A Call to Action: Haiti at 6 months\\" , World Vision Australia (12 July 2010). Retrieved 13 January 2011 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. The nation's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs, contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster. The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, Hédi Annabi.

Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves. As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors. Background The island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, is seismically active and has a history of destructive earthquakes. During Haiti's time as a French colony, earthquakes were recorded by French historian Moreau de Saint-Méry (1750–1819). He described damage done by an earthquake in 1751, writing that \\"only one masonry building had not collapsed\\" in Port-au-Prince; he also wrote that the \\"whole city collapsed\\" in the 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake. Cap-Haïtien, other towns in the north of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and the Sans-Souci Palace were destroyed during an earthquake on 7 May 1842. A magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Dominican Republic and shook Haiti on 4 August 1946, producing a tsunami that killed 1,790 people and injured many others. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and is ranked 149th of 182 countries on the Human Development Index. The Australian government's travel advisory site had previously expressed concerns that Haitian emergency services would be unable to cope in the event of a major disaster, and the country is considered \\"economically vulnerable\\" by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Haiti is no stranger to natural disasters. In addition to earthquakes, it has been struck frequently by tropical cyclones, which have caused flooding and widespread damage. The most recent cyclones to hit the island before the earthquake were Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike, all in the summer of 2008, causing nearly 800 deaths. Geology USGS intensity map Map showing regional tectonic setting of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone Tiny dots of white against the plant- covered landscape (red in this image) are possible landslides, a common occurrence in mountainous terrain after large earthquakes. The Enriquillo- Plantain Garden fault zone runs along the two linear valleys at the top of the image The magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake occurred inland, on 12 January 2010 at 16:53 (UTC−05:00), approximately WSW from Port-au-Prince at a depth of on blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system and lasted less than 30 seconds. There is no evidence of surface rupture; based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data, it is also thought that the earthquake did not involve significant lateral slip on the main Enriquillo fault. Strong shaking associated with intensity IX on the Modified Mercalli scale (MM) was recorded in Port-au-Prince and its suburbs. It was also felt in several surrounding countries and regions, including Cuba (MM III in Guantánamo), Jamaica (MM II in Kingston), Venezuela (MM II in Caracas), Puerto Rico (MM II–III in San Juan), and the bordering Dominican Republic (MM III in Santo Domingo). According to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey, approximately 3.5 million people lived in the area that experienced shaking intensity of MM VII to X, a range that can cause moderate to very heavy damage even to earthquake-resistant structures. Shaking damage was more severe than for other quakes of similar magnitude due to the quake's shallow depth.Frequently Asked Questions Institute for Crustal Studies The quake occurred in the vicinity of the northern boundary where the Caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about per year in relation to the North American plate. The strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the Septentrional-Oriente fault in the north and the Enriquillo- Plantain Garden fault in the south; both its location and focal mechanism suggested that the January 2010 quake was caused by a rupture of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, which had been locked for 250 years, gathering stress. However, a study published in May 2010 suggested that the rupture process may have involved slip on multiple blind thrust faults with only minor, deep, lateral slip along or near the main Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone, suggesting that the event only partially relieved centuries of accumulated left-lateral strain on a small part of the plate-boundary system. The rupture was roughly long with mean slip of . Preliminary analysis of the slip distribution found amplitudes of up to about using ground motion records from all over the world. A 2007 earthquake hazard study by C. DeMets and M. Wiggins-Grandison noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2 Mw earthquake, similar in size to the 1692 Jamaica earthquake. Paul Mann and a group including the 2006 study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain; the team recommended \\"high priority\\" historical geologic rupture studies, as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40 years. An article published in Haiti's Le Matin newspaper in September 2008 cited comments by geologist Patrick Charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in Port-au-Prince. Aftershocks History of the main shock and aftershocks with magnitudes larger than 4.0, data from USGS The U.S. Geological Survey recorded eight aftershocks in the two hours after the main earthquake, with magnitudes between 4.3 and 5.9. Within the first nine hours, 32 aftershocks of magnitude 4.2 or greater were recorded, 12 of which measured magnitude 5.0 or greater; in addition, on 24 January, the US Geological Survey reported that there had been 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater since the main quake. On 20 January, at 06:03 local time (11:03 UTC), the strongest aftershock since the earthquake, measuring magnitude 5.9 Mw, struck Haiti. USGS reported its epicenter was about WSW of Port-au-Prince, which would place it almost exactly under the coastal town of Petit-Goâve. A UN representative reported that the aftershock collapsed seven buildings in the town. According to staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had reached Petit-Goâve for the first time the day before the aftershock, the town was estimated to have lost 15% of its buildings, and was suffering the same shortages of supplies and medical care as the capital.Haiti earthquake: reaching victims outside the capital, International Committee of the Red Cross, 19 January 2010 Workers from the charity Save the Children reported hearing \\"already weakened structures collapsing\\" in Port-au-Prince, but most sources reported no further significant damage to infrastructure in the city. Further casualties are thought to have been minimal since people had been sleeping in the open. There are concerns that the main earthquake could be the beginning of a new long- term sequence: \\"the whole region is fearful\\"; historical accounts, although not precise, suggest that there has been a sequence of quakes progressing westwards along the fault, starting with an earthquake in the Dominican Republic in 1751. Tsunami The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning immediately after the initial quake, but quickly cancelled it. Nearly two weeks later it was reported that the beach of the small fishing town of Petit Paradis was hit by a localised tsunami shortly after the earthquake, probably as a result of an underwater slide, and this was later confirmed by researchers.Lessons to be learned from Haiti's tsunami BBC News, 25 February 2010 At least three people were swept out to sea by the wave and were reported dead. Witnesses told reporters that the sea first retreated and a \\"very big wave\\" followed rapidly, crashing ashore and sweeping boats and debris into the ocean. Damage to infrastructure Damaged buildings in Port- au-Prince Essential services Amongst the widespread devastation and damage throughout Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, vital infrastructure necessary to respond to the disaster was severely damaged or destroyed. This included all hospitals in the capital; air, sea, and land transport facilities; and communication systems. The quake affected the three Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) medical facilities around Port-au-Prince, causing one to collapse completely. A hospital in Pétion-Ville, a wealthy suburb of Port-au-Prince, also collapsed, as did the St. Michel District Hospital in the southern town of Jacmel, which was the largest referral hospital in south-east Haiti. Damaged buildings in Jacmel The quake seriously damaged the control tower at Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport. Damage to the Port-au- Prince seaport rendered the harbor unusable for immediate rescue operations; its container crane subsided severely at an angle because of weak foundations. Gonaïves seaport in northern Haiti remained operational. Roads were blocked with road debris or the surfaces broken. The main road linking Port-au-Prince with Jacmel remained blocked ten days after the earthquake, hampering delivery of aid to Jacmel. When asked why the road had not been opened, Hazem el-Zein, head of the south-east division of the UN World Food Programme said that \\"We ask the same questions to the people in charge...They promise rapid response. To be honest, I don't know why it hasn't been done. I can only think that their priority must be somewhere else.\\" There was considerable damage to communications infrastructure. The public telephone system was not available, and two of Haiti's largest cellular telephone providers, Digicel and Comcel Haiti, both reported that their services had been affected by the earthquake. Fibre-optic connectivity was also disrupted. According to Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF), Radio Lumière, which broadcasts out of Port-au-Prince and reaches 90% of Haiti, was initially knocked off the air, but it was able to resume broadcasting across most of its network within a week. According to RSF, some 20 of about 50 stations that were active in the capital region before the earthquake were back on air a week after the quake. General infrastructure National Palace collapsed In February 2010 Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings were severely damaged and needed to be demolished. The deputy mayor of Léogâne reported that 90% of the town's buildings had been destroyed. Many government and public buildings were damaged or destroyed including the Palace of Justice, the National Assembly, the Supreme Court and Port-au-Prince Cathedral. The National Palace was severely damaged, though President René Préval and his wife Elisabeth Delatour Préval escaped without injury. The Prison Civile de Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, allowing around 4,000 inmates to escape. Léogâne, close to the earthquake epicenter Most of Port-au- Prince's municipal buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, including the City Hall, which was described by The Washington Post as, \\"a skeletal hulk of concrete and stucco, sagging grotesquely to the left.\\" Port-au-Prince had no municipal petrol reserves and few city officials had working mobile phones before the earthquake, making communications and transportation very difficult. Minister of Education Joel Jean-Pierre stated that the education system had \\"totally collapsed\\". About half the nation's schools and the three main universities in Port-au-Prince were affected. More than 1,300 schools and 50 health care facilities were destroyed. The earthquake also destroyed a nursing school in the capital and severely damaged the country's primary midwifery school. The Haitian art world suffered great losses; artworks were destroyed, and museums and art galleries were extensively damaged, among them Port-au-Prince's main art museum, Centre d'Art, College Saint Pierre and Holy Trinity Cathedral. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) at Christopher Hotel and offices of the World Bank were destroyed. The building housing the offices of Citibank in Port-au-Prince collapsed, killing five employees. The clothing industry, which accounts for two-thirds of Haiti's exports, reported structural damage at manufacturing facilities. The quake created a landslide dam on the Rivière de Grand Goâve. the water level was low, but engineer Yves Gattereau believed the dam could collapse during the rainy season, which would flood Grand-Goâve downstream. Conditions in the aftermath Assistance camp set up by the Brazilian Army. In the nights following the earthquake, many people in Haiti slept in the streets, on pavements, in their cars, or in makeshift shanty towns either because their houses had been destroyed, or they feared standing structures would not withstand aftershocks.Charles, Jacqueline, Clark, Lesley, Robles, Frances Supplies begin to arrive in Haiti as aftershocks shake stunned nation, The Miami Herald, 14 January 2010 Construction standards are low in Haiti; the country has no building codes.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimated that as many as 3 million people had been affected by the quake. In mid February 2010, the Haitian government reported the death toll to have reached 230,000. However, an investigation by Radio Netherlands has questioned the official death toll, reporting an estimate of 92,000 deaths as being a more realistic figure.

On 31 May 2011, an unreleased draft report based on a survey commissioned by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) challenged the Haiti earthquake death toll and several damage estimates. The unpublished report put the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000 and put the number of displaced persons at 895,000, of which only 375,000 remained in temporary shelters. The unreleased report, which compiled its figures from a door-to-door survey, was done by a Washington consulting firm, LTL Strategies. A US State Department spokesperson said the report had inconsistencies and would not be released until they were resolved. As of January 2012, USAID has not released the report and states on its website that 1.5 million people were displaced, of which 550,000 remain without permanent shelter.

Images and testimonials circulating after the earthquake across the internet and through social media helped to intensify the reaction of global engagement. Many countries responded to the appeals and launched fund- raising efforts, as well as sending search and rescue teams. The neighbouring Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti, sending water, food and heavy-lifting machinery. The hospitals in the Dominican Republic were made available; a combined effort of the Airports Department (DA), together with the Dominican Naval Auxiliaries, the UN and other parties formed the Dominican-Haitian Aerial Support Bridge, making the main Dominican airports available for support operations to Haiti. The Dominican website FlyDominicanRepublic.com made available to the internet, daily updates on airport information and news from the operations center on the Dominican side. The Dominican emergency team assisted more than 2,000 injured people, while the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped with the restoration of some telephone services. The Dominican Red Cross coordinated early medical relief in conjunction with the International Red Cross. The government sent eight mobile medical units along with 36 doctors including orthopaedic specialists, traumatologists, anaesthetists, and surgeons. In addition, 39 trucks carrying canned food were dispatched, along with 10 mobile kitchens and 110 cooks capable of producing 100,000 meals per day.

The US military initially gave priority to military units in order to secure the airport, distribute aid, and provide security, but after that, incoming relief flights were cleared or rejected on a first-come, first-served basis. According to a US Air Force captain who had coordinated flight schedules, nearly all groups sending aid insisted their shipment was urgent. Those flights that were rejected were diverted to the Dominican Republic, and their cargoes were unloaded and taken to Haiti by land. At the peak of the relief efforts, the airport was in a state of chaos. Normally, the airport, with a single runway and 10 spaces for large planes, handled 20 flights a day. After the earthquake struck, hundreds of planes rushed to Haiti without designated landing times. On average, a plane would land or take off every two minutes. The situation was complicated by the lack of room on ramps for planes to unload their cargo, and some planes did not have enough fuel to leave. While international efforts received significant media coverage, much of the local rescue effort was conducted by Haitians While the Port-au-Prince airport ramp has spaces for more than a dozen airliners, in the days following the quake, it sometimes served nearly 40 at once, creating serious delays. The supply backup at the airport was expected to ease as the apron management improved, and when the perceived need for heavy security diminished. Airport congestion was reduced on 18 January when the United Nations and US forces formally agreed to prioritise humanitarian flights over security reinforcement. By 14 January, more than 20 countries had sent military personnel to the country, with Canada, the United States, and the Dominican Republic providing the largest contingents.

Canadians were able to donate through the Humanitarian Coalition which distributed funds to partner organizations working in the field. During this time the Humanitarian Coalition raised over C$15 Million. After a United Nations call for help for the people affected by the earthquake, Canada pledged an additional C$60 million in aid on 19 January 2010, bringing Canada's total contribution to C$135 million. By 8 February 2010, the federal International Co-operation Department, through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), had already provided about C$85 million in humanitarian aid through UN agencies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and to organizations such as CARE, Médecins du Monde, Save the Children, Oxfam Quebec, the Centre for International Studies and co-operation, and World Vision. On 23 January 2010, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the federal government had lifted the limit on the amount of money allocated for matching individual donations to relief efforts, and that the federal government would continue to match individual donations until 12 February 2010; by the deadline, Canadians had privately raised C$220 million. On top of matching donations, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda pledged an additional C$290 million in long-term relief to be spent between 2010 and 2012, including C$8 million in debt relief to Haiti, part of a broader cancellation of the country's overall World Bank debt.

Working in close partnership with other relief organizations, Real Medicine organized deployments of volunteer medical specialists to meet the needs of partner hospitals and clinics at the Haiti–Dominican Republic border and in Port-au- Prince, provided direct funding, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to local health facilities and partner hospitals, provided advisory services and coordination to local health facilities, including physical therapy support, and coordinated mobile health outreaches, field clinics and food supplies to outlying villages overlooked in the relief effort.Haiti Earthquake Relief Projects Real Medicine Foundation On 15 January 2011, the Catholic Relief Services announced a US$200 million, five-year relief and reconstruction program that covers shelter, health, livelihoods, and child protection among its program areas. Status of the recovery Six months after the quake as much as 98% of the rubble remained uncleared. An estimated 26 million cubic yards (20 million cubic meters) remained, making most of the capital impassable, and thousands of bodies remained in the rubble. The number of people in relief camps of tents and tarps since the quake was 1.6 million, and almost no transitional housing had been built. Most of the camps had no electricity, running water, or sewage disposal, and the tents were beginning to fall apart. Crime in the camps was widespread, especially against women and girls. Between 23 major charities, US$1.1 billion had been collected for Haiti for relief efforts, but only two percent of the money had been released. According to a CBS report, US$3.1 billion had been pledged for humanitarian aid and was used to pay for field hospitals, plastic tarps, bandages, and food, plus salaries, transportation and upkeep of relief workers. By May 2010, enough aid had been raised internationally to give each displaced family a cheque for US$37,000. In July 2010, CNN returned to Port-au-Prince and reported, \\"It looks like the quake just happened yesterday\\", and Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the United Nations office of humanitarian affairs in Haiti, said that \\"six months from that time it may still look the same.\\" Land ownership posed a particular problem for rebuilding because so many pre-quake homes were not officially registered. \\"Even before the national registry fell under the rubble, land tenure was always a complex and contentious issue in Haiti. Many areas of Port-au-Prince were settled either by tonton makout – Duvalier's death squads – given land for their service or by squatters. In many cases land ownership was never officially registered. Even if this logistical logjam were to be cleared, the vast majority of Port-au-Prince residents, up to 85%, did not own their homes before the earthquake.\\"Mark Schuller, Is Haiti Falling Through the Cracks?

They also worked to push the international community to recognize the wave of evictions from camps that started as early as three months after the earthquake and to put protections in place, but little was done in response. In September 2010 there were over one million refugees still living in tents, and the humanitarian situation was characterized as still being in the emergency phase, according to the Apostolic Nuncio to Haiti, Archbishop Bernard Auza. He went on to say that the number was rising instead of diminishing, and reported that the state had decided to first rebuild downtown Port-au-Prince and a new government center, but reconstruction had not yet begun.

She blamed the international community for abandoning its commitments. In a public letter co-authored with UNESCO head Irina Bokova, Jean said, \\"As time passes, what began as a natural disaster is becoming a disgraceful reflection on the international community.\\" The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, led by former US President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, had been set up to facilitate the flow of funds toward reconstruction projects in April 2010, but as of January 2011, no major reconstruction had started. =2012= In January 2012, two years since the quake, figures released by the United Nations show that of the nearly US$4.5 billion pledged for reconstruction projects in 2010 and 2011, only 43% has been delivered. Venezuela and the US, which promised the major share of reconstruction funds, have disbursed only 24% and 30%, respectively. Japan and Finland are among the few donors to have fully met their pledges. The data shows that some crucial sectors face particularly large funding gaps. In 2010 and 2011, for example, donors disbursed just US$125 million of the US$311 million in grants allocated to agriculture projects, and only US$108 million of the US$315 million in grants allocated to health projects. Only 6% of bilateral aid for reconstruction projects has gone through Haitian institutions, and less than 1% of relief funding has gone through the government of Haiti. A January 2012 Oxfam report said that a half a million Haitians remained homeless, still living under tarps and in tents. Watchdog groups have criticized the reconstruction process saying that part of the problem is that charities spent a considerable amount of money on \\"soaring rents, board members' needs, overpriced supplies and imported personnel,\\" the Miami Herald reported. \\"A lot of good work was done; the money clearly didn't all get squandered,\\" but, \\"A lot just wasn't responding to needs on the ground. Millions were spent on ad campaigns telling people to wash their hands. Telling them to wash their hands when there's no water or soap is a slap in the face.\\" The Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, Let Haiti Live, and the Center For Constitutional Rights have recommended immediate changes to recovery efforts to ensure that critical human rights concerns are addressed. A report found that, \\"The conditions in the displaced persons camps are abysmal, particularly for women and girls who too often are victims of gender‐based violence\\". They call for more oversight of accountability of reconstruction plans, asking, \\"Why have only 94,000 transitional shelters been built to date despite a stated goal of 125,000 in the first year?\\" On 25 August 2012, recovery was hampered due to Tropical Storm Isaac impacting Haiti's southern peninsula. There it caused flooding and 29 deaths according to local reporting. As a result of the 2010 earthquake, more than 400,000 Haitians continue to live in tents and experienced the storm without adequate shelter.Aid workers prep Haiti's tent city residents for Isaac's onlsaught – World News In late October, with over 370,000 still living in tent camps, a second tropical storm, Hurricane Sandy, killed 55 and left large portions of Haiti under water.

The 2010 cholera outbreak has continued. According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention it is considered the worst epidemic of cholera since the 1994 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (called Zaire at that time). By August 2013, it had killed over 8,231 Haitians and hospitalized hundreds of thousands more. More than 6% of Haitians have had the disease. Care of cholera patients remains inadequate with much now done in tent facilities with rows of cots for patient treatment. The United Nations peacekeeping force, widely believed responsible for the cholera outbreak, continues to refuse to accept responsibility, however, they have launched a $2.2 billion initiative to combat cholera and the construction of a $17 million teaching hospital in Mirebalais which will employ 800 Haitians and treat 185,000 people.Government of Haiti, health ministry http://www.mspp.gouv.ht/site/downloads/Rapport%20%20Web%2012.08_Avec_Courbes_Departementales.pdf By the beginning of the year only a small part—$215 million—of the total funds collected for aid had been spent on permanent housing, with most of it—$1.2 billion—going for short-term solutions including tent camps, temporary shelters, and cash grants that paid a year's rent. A 2013 survey disclosed that of the 1.5 million Haitians living in camps following the quake, about 279,000 remained in a total of 352 camps. 15% of the camps had no basic protection services, and 48% no health services. While 20% lacked functioning toilets, this is higher than the population outside tent cities, where 50% lack toilets. Many camps remained at a risk for flooding and more than a third of the camps (108) were at risk for evictions. In a 2013 statement, the American Red Cross reported that almost all of the money collected for quake relief has been spent or is scheduled for making progress permanent by ensuring people can leave camps and return to stable communities, which includes building new homes, repairing homes, completing a new hospital and clinic, and signing an agreement for a second hospital.Haiti Earthquake Response – Three -Year Update Red Cross. January 2013. =2015= In 2015, NPR and ProPublica investigated the disappearance of US$500 million donated to the American Red Cross for earthquake relief, earlier described by the charity as the result of \\"one of the most successful fundraisers ever\\". Despite the claims of the American Red Cross that 130,000 homes had been built, the investigation discovered that only six had been built. The investigation reviewed \\"hundreds\\" of pages of internal documents and interviewed \\"more than a dozen\\" former and current staff members, investigating the organization's claim that 4.5 million Haitians had been helped \\"back on their feet.\\" Joel Boutroue, a Haitian government advisor, said that this number would cover \\"100 percent of the urban area\\", and observed that it would mean the Red Cross had served every city in Haiti. Numerous other claims did not hold up under investigation. NPR found that the project was riddled with \\"multiple staffing changes\\", bureaucratic delays and a language barrier, as many of the Red Cross officials spoke neither French nor Haitian Creole. General counsel for the American Red Cross, David Meltzer, provided investigators with the NGO's official statistics, but would not elaborate on them. The public affairs office of the Red Cross disputed NPR and ProPublica's claims in an email, and claimed that their investigative report could cause an international incident. By June the American Red Cross had transferred the rebuilding efforts to the Haitian Red Cross. =2016= In 2016 Haiti was struck by Hurricane Matthew which leveled entire communities and caused an upsurge in the ongoing cholera epidemic which was introduced to the island by United Nations peacekeepers. As of March 2017, around 7% of Haiti's population (around 800,665 people) have been affected with cholera, and 9,480 Haitians have died. =2017= In 2017, the United Nations reported that 2.5 million Haitians were still in need of humanitarian aid. U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Mourad Wahba said, \\"There are still about 55,000 people in camps and makeshift camps. Many are still living in unsanitary conditions due to displacement caused by the earthquake. We have a very long way to go.\\" In literature The Haiti 2010 earthquake has been depicted in the novel God Loves Haiti, by Dimitry Elias Léger.

Biography  Jeune Femme Nue se Coiffant His father was a master shoemaker. After completing his basic education, in 1860, he was enrolled at the . He paid for his tuition there and supported himself by painting commercial signs and making copies of artworks. In 1866, his painting, The Death of Alcibiades earned him a scholarship from the City of Toulouse. This enabled him to enroll at the École des beaux-arts de Paris, where he study with the military history painter, Adolphe Yvon. While there, he also worked for Goupil & Cie, where he specialized in reproductions of famous works. He also made woodcuts and portraits for the publishing firm, Hachette. Study for a Landscape In 1867, he found a position in the studios of Jean-Léon Gérôme and completed his artistic studies. At that time, his stated goal was to obtain the prestigious Prix de Rome. His first attempt in 1870 did not succeed. In 1873, he was awarded Second Prize for \\"Super Flumina Babylonis\\" (By the Rivers of Babylon, depicting the Babylonian Captivity), which was purchased by the government. Shortly after, he visited Florence and Rome. During the 1880s, he gained more widespread recognition and his financial situation improved. Many of his works were popularized by major periodicals such as L'Illustration. He also produced fewer historical paintings and concentrated on portraits in a Naturalistic style. Eventually, he was able to purchase property in Normandy. In 1888, he married Eugénie Poumian. They had three daughters. His reputation was assured when he was awarded a medal at the Exposition Universelle (1889). That same year, he was named a Chevalier in the Légion d'honneur.. Portrait of the painter Georges- Paul Manceau Together with Ernest Meissonier, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Auguste Rodin, he helped revitalize the Société nationale des beaux-arts and organize an annual exhibition that would compete with the world famous Salon. As a confirmed Republican, he participated in the creation and decoration of monuments established by the Third Republic. Between 1896 and 1904, he painted three military scenes in the Salle des Illustres at the Capitole de Toulouse. During World War I, he took refuge at Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, where he helped restore the old episcopal palace. At that time, he painted mostly landscapes in an Impressionist style. All of those works are still in the possession of his descendants. After the war, he worked on creating a monument honoring those from that area who had died in the war. Later, he returned to Paris and died there in 1925.

He participated in the 2002 Winter Olympics. In the Men's 1.5 km Qualification his time was 4:48.4 making him 70th place. Khadka was born in Nepal, of the Chhetri caste. His father, a former policeman, had provided help to Richard Morley a British entrepreneur who fell ill while traveling in that country in 1984, traveling a distance that normally takes six days in three. After recovering, Morley asked the older Khadka how he could thank him; here Morley learned the other man was seriously ill, who asked Morley to take care of his son Jayaram should anything happen to him. They exchanged photos, and Morely returned to the United Kingdom. Morley was unable to return to Nepal until five or six years later, at which time he learned the ex-policeman had died and Jayaram had moved to Bhaktapur. While dining at a restaurant in that city he was approached by a boy sweeping the establishment's floor, who asked Morley, \\"Are you the man who has come to rescue me?\\"Phil Sweeney, How We Met; Richard Morley and Jayram Khadka, The Independent, published 24 May 1997 After a second meeting, Morley decided to offer Jayaram to come live with him at his castle in the Forest of Dean.

As he explains, \\"Landing at Gatwick was like being picked up and put on Mars -- a hi-tech, completely different planet. There were things like escalators, automatic doors, strange food -- ham, red wine. I tried it and was almost sick, like drinking paraffin.\\" Morley had originally planned to host Jayaram for six months, but immediately changed this to three years, and eventually fought the Home Office to obtain residential status for the boy. As an experienced skier, Morley recognized his foster son was very athletic. Taking him to the French Alps, he encouraged him to take up skiing and began coaching him. At the same time Morley had founded the Nepalese Ski Association and started planning Jay’s bid to qualify for the Olympic Winter Games. When injuries prevented him from competing in Alpine skiing events, he decided to compete in cross-country in the 2002 Winter Olympics. Jayaram Khadka carried his country's flag in their first appearance at the Winter Olympics, and afterwards finished 79th in the 10 kilometer pursuit and 69th in the sprint.

Biography A pupil of Cabanel, Debat-Ponsan was famous for his portraits of wealthy citizens and politicians in Paris, paintings of ancient history and scenes of peasant life. As a Republican and veteran of the War of 1870, Debat-Ponsan engaged in the struggle for rehabilitation of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, he exhibited his allegorical painting Vérité sortant du puits (shown here) at the 1898 Salon, The Artistic Debate, Princeton later offered to Émile Zola. In 1877 he traveled to Italy thanks to a sum of 4,000 francs which was granted to him by the Academy. There he saw different painting works, after which he began to paint portraits. In 1882–1883 he made a trip to Istanbul accompanied by his two brothers-in-law, Jules-Arsène Garnier and Henri-Eugène Delacroix (not to be confused with Eugène Delacroix). This trip inspired one of his most celebrated works, Le Massage, Scène de Hammam [The Massage at the Hamman] (1883) now in the Museum of Augustins in Toulouse. He was Father of the architect and Grand Prix de Rome winner in 1912, Jacques Debat-Ponsan, and grandfather of Michel Debré, who became Prime Minister under General Charles de Gaulle and was one of the drafters of the Fifth Republic. Other descendants include the politician Jean- Louis Debré. His daughter Jeanne Debat-Ponsan married Robert Debré founder of modern pediatrics in France (see Debré family). His grandson was Michel Debré, who was Prime Minister of France. La Vache bien gardée, 1890. Molière et Goudouli,1907 Work His scenes of rural life, very fashionable genre around 1830–1840, hesitate between an idealism of the peasant world and the militant realism of a Gustave Courbet. The painting, One morning at the gates of the Louvre may have political overtones. It depicts Catherine de' Medici (in black) calmly viewing the bodies of victims of the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Debat-Ponsan may have actually intended to refer to more recent events in French history, such as the bloody suppression of the Commune of Paris, nine years before this painting was made.

The farmhouse and the farm buildings are recorded separately in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings. History The farm was built in 1888–89 as a model farm for the 1st Duke of Westminster on his Eaton Hall estate and designed by the Chester firm of architects Douglas and Fordham. Architecture The farmhouse is built in brown brick with sandstone dressings and diapering in blue brick and some timber framing. It has a red tile roof. The plan consists of a main wing facing Saighton Lane and two separate wings at the rear, forming a U-shape. The building has two storeys plus attics. The main front has three bays with timber framing in its upper storey and attic. The central bay projects forward towards the lane and contains a porch. In its lower storey is a three-light mullioned casement window on the left and the porch, which is recessed and framed, is on the right. The upper storey contains a three-light window and in the gable above it is a two-light window. Around these windows is timber-framed panelling. The frames over the porch contain the inscriptions \\"The profit of the earth is for all; the King himself is served by the field\\", and \\"Every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God\\", the latter being a text taken from the Epistle to the Hebrews. The lateral bays each have a mullioned window in the ground floor. The return to the left of the main front has a gable containing a window and timber-framed panelling. There are three brick chimney stacks. One rises from the right return and has a plinth and three flues with twisted brickwork; another rises from the rear of the main wing and is similar, with four flues. The third chimney stack at the rear of the left wing is plain. Together with the farmhouse, the farm buildings form three sides of a quadrangle, open towards the lane. There are two two-storey wings, one opposite the farmhouse, the other at the rear, and a smaller single-storey wing behind the farmhouse. The upper storey of the wing opposite the house has timber framing in the upper storey; otherwise the buildings are in brown brick with blue brick diapering. In the gable at the end of the wing opposite the farmhouse facing the lane is a two-light mullioned window surrounded by panelling. Douglas submitted his design for this building and for Wrexham Road Farm at the Royal Academy in 1888. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe this model farm as \\"a particularly nice one\\".

His devotion to his wife is noted by Sozomen.Historia Ecclesiastica, 9.2.4, cited in Cameron, p. 177. In 386 he is attested as magister officiorum. As such, he was sent by Emperor Theodosius I to Antioch in 387, where the population had revolted against taxation. Caesarius, together with Ellobicus, then magister militum per Orientem, held an inquiry. Caesarius paid particular attention for the situation of the citizens of Antioch and in his report to the Emperor pleaded for clemency for them. The Antiochian orator Libanius thanked him in an oration for this.Libanius, Oration, 21.29, cited in Cameron, p. 178.

After Rufinus had been killed in November 395, Caesarius succeeded him as praetorian prefect of the East. As such, he nullified several laws Rufinus had passed, including a ban of Lycians from Constantinople - Rufinus's enemies, Eutolmius Tatianus and Proculus had been Lycians - and the prohibition against Arian Eunomians from making wills. However, Caesarius did not act out of opposition to Rufinus, as is shown by the fact that he also issued a law that prevented the widows of proscribed men from losing their properties (the widow of Rufinus probably benefited by this law).Cameron, p. 180. In April 400, Gainas returned to Constantinople with his army, and asked Emperor Arcadius to depose and hand him Aurelianus and Saturninus. Gainas chose Caesarius as successor to Aurelianus to the office of Praetorian prefect of the East, but, after a short time, he left Constantinople and was defeated by the magister militum per Orientem Fravitta. However, Caesarius kept his office until 403.Cameron, p. 8. To this period is to be dated an inscription in Tralles, in which Caesarius is attested Patricius, a title that, combined with Praetorian prefecture of the East and his status as a former consul, put Caesarius at the top of the dignities.Cameron, p. 189. Caesarius bought a monastery from the followers of Macedonius. The property had been left as legacy to the monks by Eusebia, a close friend of Caesarius' wife, who had asked them to bury the relics of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste she kept in her house. Caesarius demolished the monastery and buried his wife and her friend, then built a shrine to Saint Thyrsus, and a tomb for himself close by.Jonathan Bardill, Brickstamps of Constantinople, Oxford University Press, 2004, , p. 31.  In literature  Caesarius has been identified by some scholarsBury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire, Chapter 6.Other think that Typhon is to be identified with the other Praetorian prefect and consul of the period, Flavius Eutychianus. with the character of Typhon of the Aegyptus, sive De providentia by Synesius, where the story of the struggle between the Egyptian god Osiris and Typhon is used to retell the story of the struggle between Aurelianus (Osiris) and Caesarius in the period of the revolt of Gainas. In the novel, Typhon- Caesarius plays the role of the villain, Osiris-Aurelius the main character. Apart from its literary merits, the De providentia has been useful in reconstructing the events of that period, even if historians need to recast the allegories to real people and historical events and to remove Synesius' bias in favour of Aurelianus.Cameron.

A màndapa is a pillared structure that is open on all sides and protects the person(s) inside from the sun with a roof. By definition, as of the 20th century, mándapas, as temporary structures, are built inside a house or a building and serve as recitation platform during remembrance ceremonies for the dead. Built by King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196) and named after him, it is located near the western entrance of the Dalada Maluva, the area that contains the oldest and most sacred monuments in the city. A nearby stone inscription identifies this as the building used by Nissanka Malla to listen to pirith (chanting of Buddhist scriptures). The structure is an elevated stone platform with a number of stone columns and surrounded by a low stone wall. These stone columns are the unique feature about the Nissanka Latha Manadapaya, since they are carved in a manner that is found nowhere else in the country. The eight granite columns are arranged in two rows, with four in each row. Presumably used to support a roof, each of them is approximately in height. In each of these columns, the crown is carved in the shape of a blossoming lotus bud. The rest of the column is elaborately carved to resemble the stem of the flower. Unlike stone columns commonly seen in the architecture of this period, these are not straight, but are curved in three places. According to archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana, the stone columns at the Nissanka Latha Mandapaya are the best examples of this feature of ancient Sri Lankan architecture. At the center of the platform, flanked by the stone columns, appears a small stupa. This is also made from stone, but the top part of it has been destroyed. Its base is decorated with a carved design. The platform is surrounded by a stone railing. The structure is entered through a single stone doorway. In contrast to the elaborately carved stone pillars, these have an undecorated and plain finish.

She was built for Thomas Sopwith who used his aviation design expertise to ensure the yacht was the most advanced of its day with a steel hull and mast. She was and launched in 1934 and won many races in her first season including against the J's Velsheda and Shamrock V. She failed in her America's Cup challenge against the American defender Rainbow but came closer to lifting the cup than any other until Australia II succeeded in 1983. Design Endeavour was designed by Charles Ernest Nicholson. Endeavour pioneered the Quadrilateral genoa, a twin clewed headsail offering great sail area and consequent power. Career=America's Cup Endeavour challenged for the 1934 America's Cup and raced New York Yacht Club defender Rainbow. However, the campaign was blighted by a strike of Sopwith's professional crew prior to departing for America. Forced to rely mainly on keen amateurs, who lacked the necessary experience, the campaign failed. Rainbow won with 4–2. This was one of the most contentious of the America's Cup battles and prompted the headline \\"Britannia rules the waves and America waives the rules.\\" After America's Cup Following the America's Cup, she dominated the British sailing scene until, whilst being towed across the Atlantic to Britain in September 1937, she broke loose from her tow and was feared lost. the hulk was eventually found and returned to England where she was laid up. For 46 years Endeavour languished through a variety of owners. In 1947, she was sold for scrap, saved only a few hours before her demolition was due. In the 1970s she sank in the River Medina, Isle of Wight. Endeavour was purchased for ten pounds and patched up enough to refloat. Until the mid-1980s she was on shore at Calshot Spit, an ex-seaplane base on the edge of the New Forest, Southern England. By this time she was in a desperate state, with only the hull remaining, lacking rudder, mast and keel. Rebuild The interior after the renovation In 1984 the hulk of Endeavour was bought by Elizabeth Meyer, who undertook a five-year project to rebuild her. The initial work was undertaken where she lay to ensure that the hull was sufficiently seaworthy to be towed to the shipyard of Royal Huisman, in Holland, who designed and installed a new rig, engine, generator and mechanical systems and fitted the interior to a very high standard. Meyer described the rebuild not only as challenging, but also beyond her financial means. In a 2014 interview with CNN she described a \\"restoration urge\\" as being \\"inherent in the human nature\\" and said that she \\"immediately went 'Oh no'\\" when she realised the enormity of this task and that it fell to her. Meyer said she had to sell real estate investments to fund the restoration and that Endeavour was chartered throughout her entire ownership. When Endeavour sailed again, on 22 June 1989, it was for the first time in 52 years. In September that year Meyer organised the first J‑Class race for over 50 years, pitting Endeavour against Shamrock V at Newport, Rhode Island. She needed 90 professional sailors to crew the two yachts but could not afford to pay them; despite this, the appeal and prestige of the restored J‑Class was so great that she was inundated with several hundred applications. Endeavour cruised extensively and in 1999 joined the rebuilt Velsheda and Shamrock V to compete in the Antigua Classics Regatta. 21st century Meyer sold Endeavour to Dennis Kozlowski for US$15M in 2000. In 2006, she was sold again, this time to Hawaiian resident Cassio Antunes for $13.1M. In 2011, Endeavour completed an 18-month refit in New Zealand, during which a carbon- fiber mast and standing rigging were fitted and some changes were made to the deck layout. In summer 2015, it was reported that Endeavour was again for sale, with an asking price of €19,950,000.

History  Adventism in Norway came from the Pietist revival that was caused by Norwegian Lutheran preacher Hans Nielsen Hauge. Evidence suggests that four families in southern Norway became the nucleus of Norwegian Adventism after discovering the seventh-day Sabbath, though it is not believed to have been the result of contact from keepers of the Sabbath. Instead, it is believed that it was derived from their reading of the Bible. The Danish American John Gottlieb Matteson came to Norway in 1878 and began working as a missionary for the Seventh-day Adventists. Gottlieb composed the first Dano-Norwegian Adventist hymnal. He became the editor of Avent Tidende in 1872, which was eventually distributed to Scandinavian countries. It experienced good reception, leading to Matteson to go to Denmark and Kristiania (now Oslo) to preach. He later participated in the construction of the first church organized in Oslo. Matteson continued to work on publication work, including on Tidernes Tegn (Signs of the Times) and Sunnhetsbladet (Health Magazine). These were one of only few periodicals at the time and allowed members of the congregation to earn money through distribution. The church runs a number of private schools in Norway.  Congregation  Early on in 1879, his congregation in Norway consisted of 34 people who were mostly working-class women. There were 652 Adventists in Norway in 1901, and 1,826 in 1921. In 2013, there were approximately 4,600 Adventists in Norway. As of June 30, 2018, the Adventist church had a total membership count of 4,535 people.Adventist Directory Retrieved December 3, 2018 The Church is split into three districts: * Northern Norway * Western Norway * Eastern Norway Between these districts, as of 2013, there are 62 congregations and 43 churches. On September 20, 2015, the Norwegian Union Conference Executive Committee of the Adventist Church voted to cease the ordaining of both male and female pastors due to a disagreement on Biblical readings on ordination. Seventh-day Adventist Church in Norway pays pastoral employees the same wages and under the same terms regardless of gender.

EPI is dedicated to high-level research and policy analysis on a variety of educational issues, including the challenges that individuals and families from underserved communities face throughout their educational career. EPI is a certified small business (SWaM) based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with partners in renowned research and educational organizations around the world. The resources and knowledge gained through these partnerships and collaborations enhance EPI's ability to conduct high-level research with global and local relevance and expertise. History & mission The Educational Policy Institute's mission is: > To expand educational opportunity for low-income and other historically- > underrepresented students through high-level research and analysis. By > providing educational leaders and policymakers with the information required > to make prudent programmatic and policy decisions, we believe that the doors > of opportunity can be further opened for all students, resulting in an > increase in the number of students prepared for, enrolled in, and completing > postsecondary education. In 2002, Dr. Watson Scott Swail founded EPI to establish stronger connections between educational research and educational policy, with an emphasis on historically-underserved communities such as students from low-income families, students of color, and students with disabilities. Swail chose this focus because these student populations tend to be the primary target of the majority of educational policy programs, while their voices are simultaneously under-represented in the policy-making arena. This discrepancy points to the need for a greater understanding of what factors have the greatest influence on their educational outcomes. Another research focus for EPI is the expansion of access to educational opportunities that are found to be of high quality, with the rationale that access is only relevant if it is to a quality learning experience. As the economy has become increasingly global, EPI supports the notion that students must be armed with skills that set them up for success in a competitive and technologically savvy market. Thus, EPI recognizes the rising need for students to attain postsecondary degrees, and focuses a great deal of its research on the ability of underserved student populations to matriculate through and graduate from higher education institutions, including the financial and social challenges that come along with this goal. Services provided by EPI EPI's areas of expertise include policy analysis, research design and evaluation, management solutions, data collection and professional development. EPI designs and directs research and evaluation studies for organizations, schools and government agencies to answer questions that contribute to a better understanding of K-12 and postsecondary education and how to improve student outcomes. EPI designs and conducts research experiments, engages in evaluation research and survey development, and conducts data analysis. Recent projects include evaluations of federally funded initiatives including the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program, GEAR UP, Reading First,http://www.ed.gov/programs/readingfirst/index.html Safe Schools/Healthy Students, Teacher Quality Partnership, Teaching American History, Title II Improving Teacher Quality, and Title III Strengthening Institutions; evaluation design and metrics development for the Library of Congress and the Texas Education Agency; policy analysis for the National Council on Disability; and research and policy studies and technical assistance related to postsecondary student success for DeVry, the Imagine America Foundation, and TG. EPI's research and evaluation team includes researchers from around the world, who are matched to specific projects based on prior experience and expertise. EPI has developed several software products to support educators. In 2006, EPI developed the Institutional Student Retention Assessment (ISRA), which serves as a web-based campus audit system focused on student retention. The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving or losing students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a longitudinal data management system that can be used in conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track individual students, collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act. In the realm of professional development, EPI frequently hosts workshops, conferences, and webinars to support and inform professionals in the field of education research and policy.

Individual collected at Davos, Switzerland (2003) Herbchronology is the analysis of annual growth rings (or simply annual rings) in the secondary root xylem of perennial herbaceous plants. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die down at the end of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life. Perennial herb species belonging to the dicotyledon group (also known as perennial forbs) are characterized by secondary growth, which shows as a new growth ring added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual growth rings. Counting of annual growth rings can be used to determine the age of a perennial herb similarly as it is done in trees using dendrochronology. This way it was found that some perennial herbs live up to 50 years and more. History The term herb-chronology is referring to dendrochronology because of the similarity of the structures investigated. The term was introduced in the late 1990s, however, the existence of annual rings in perennial herbs was already observed in earlier times by several researchers. Annual growth rings Like trees and woody plants, perennial herbs have a growth zone called vascular cambium between the root bark and the root xylem. The vascular cambium ring is active during growing season and produces a new layer of xylem tissue or growth ring every year. This addition of a new lateral layer each year is called secondary growth and is exactly the same as in woody plants. Each individual growth ring consists of earlywood tissue that is formed at the beginning of the growing season and latewood tissue formed in summer and fall. Earlywood tissue is characterized by wide vessels or denser arrangement of vessels, whereas latewood tissue shows narrower vessels and/or lower vessel density. Annual growth rings in herbs are usually only visible by means of a microscope and a specific staining method. Ring-like patterns visible in roots cross sections by the naked eye may be false rings. The width of annual growth rings depends on conditions during formation; in a favorable year it is wider and in a less favorable year narrower. Applications Herbchronology is used in many fields of ecological and biological research, for instance in community ecology, population biology, plant ecology and invasion biology. Herbchronology is used as a tool to estimate plant age. This may be relevant information to determine : *… the longevity of a perennial herbaceous plant species; this is valuable information for flora books and an important aspect of life history strategy of a species. *… the population age structure; this is valuable for questions into population dynamics or the spreading patterns of invasive species. Herbchronology allows to assess long-term annual growth rates of a perennial herbaceous plant without having to monitor it. This may be relevant information to assess … *… the impact of fluctuations in specific climatic conditions on growth. *… the impact of changes in site conditions such as competition. *… lifetime growth patterns.

Early English settlement attempts in North America In 1607 a Plymouth Company expedition led by George Popham and partially financed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges founded Popham Colony in Maine, which lasted one year before being abandoned. During that year the colonists built a seaworthy boat, the Virginia pinnace. In Massachusetts, the 'old planters' proved through their hard work that settlement was possible; subsequent to this, there was a major influx of 'new planters' that continued over a decade.Butler, E.B. & M. [2009] Planters of Early New England: A Sketch of Roger Mowry Mann's Seventeenth Century Ancestors self-published The early expansions centered around Plymouth and what is now Essex County, Massachusetts but eventually spawned the westward movements. Plymouth Two early areas of settlement were Plymouth (c 1620) and Nantasket (c 1621). The Plymouth Colony began with the Mayflower's landing and is a well-known story. The Nantasket settlement followed soon after that of Plymouth. Roger Conant was at these two settlements before going north to Cape Ann. Essex The Essex colony started at Cape Ann in 1623 with a party led by Thomas Gardner and John Tylly. For this party, there were two ships with 32 people who were to settle the area commercially. About a year later, this party was joined by a group from Plymouth led by Roger Conant. These efforts were funded by the Dorchester Company, which withdrew its funding after 1625. In 1626, some of the original party, as many left to return to England or to go south, moved the settlement, in hopes of finding more success, to Naumkeag. This settlement worked out and became Salem. According to the Essex Institute, the list of old planters, in 1626, who were in Cape Ann before the move were as follows: :Roger Conant - Governor, John Lyford - Minister (went to Virginia, instead of Naumkeag), John Woodbury, Humphrey Woodbury, John Balch, Peter Palfray, Walter Knight, William Allen,Crane, EB (1907) Historic homes and institutions ... Worcester Historical Museum, (via google.com) Thomas Gray, John Tylly, Thomas Gardner, Richard Norman (and his son), William Jeffrey, and Capt. William Trask.Felt, Joseph B. [1827] Annals of Salem Referenced in Historical Collections, Essex Institute Some of these, with Conant, have been referenced as the 'old planters' of Salem: Woodbury, Trask, Balch, Palfrey.Raymond, R. (2003) 'Map of the Old Planters 1000 Acre Grant of 1635' self-published With Gardner, and then Conant, in the lead, this early group was known for independence and tolerance which traits some (to wit, Puritan minister John White) may have seen as being, perhaps, unfit; there had been reports detailing issues, such as insubordination, as far back as Merrymount and the Cape Ann effort. Some of the old planters, however, managed to thrive in the less tolerant religious atmosphere of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The subsequent changes in leadership, with first John Endecott and then John Winthrop, brought in some military discipline and also religious focus. After that, new planters came in successive waves. John Endecott brought with him, in 1628, the patent that replaced the Dorchester Company with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. A little later, Rev Francis Higginson brought more settlers and set up the first parsonage. Rev Higginson also established the notion that the settlement was of religion and not trade, seemingly contradictory to the interests of London. By 1630, Puritan interests had organized a massive influx led by John Winthrop, who decided the Cape Ann area was not suitable for the number of arriving colonists, and founded Boston to the south instead. Even though center of government was in Boston, by 1700, the population of the Cape Ann area, which was organized into Essex County in the 1640s, had also grown rapidly. The population of New England went from less than 500 to over 26,000 in the years from 1629 to 1640. Plymouth involvement The Plymouth colony had made excursions along the Massachusetts coast including north to Cape Ann. Some records report that Cushman and Winslow of Plymouth had received a patent for Cape Ann (1623/24). Other reports suggest that salting structures had been built in the Cape Ann area to support fishing efforts.A Brief Post-Pilgrim History of Cape Ann (via cape- ann.com The Gardner group, who were to settle the area, did succeed in maintaining themselves after their landing, though the commercial goals of the Dorchester Company were not met. There were also disagreement between the Plymouth colonists and the Dorchester Company settlers, due to patent conflicts. Roger Conant, having first been at Plymouth, was probably instrumental in working out a compromise, part of which resulted in the Dorchester group moving to the Naumkeag area. Establishment of the Bay Colony John Winthrop's influence, with his arrival with a caravan in 1630, was a major change for the Massachusetts Bay area, in that he came in with 700 people and ships full of supplies. In June 1630, the Winthrop Fleet arrived in what would later be called Salem, which on account of lack of food, \\"pleased them not.\\"Weston, George F. Boston Ways: High, By & Folk, Beacon Press: Beacon Hill, Boston, p.11-15 (1957). They proceeded to Charlestown, which pleased them less, for lack of fresh water. Finally, they were shown the Shawmut Peninsula, where they established Boston. Some of the Old Planters may have followed Winthrop from Salem; Conant and Gardner stayed in the Salem area. So too did some people who arrived with Winthrop, such as Major William Hathorne, father to John Hathorne and ancestor of Salem native Nathaniel Hawthorne. Winthrop's establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony drastically altered the institutions of the few souls who had pioneered the area earlier. A proper government was organized. Within four years, Harvard College was born.  Notes  ;Footnotes ;Citations References  * External links *Thomas Gardner Society *Higginson, TW [1900].

It is found in Southeast Asia. Description The Cambodian logsucker has a broad midlateral stripe which has a width roughly equal to 2 scale rows, it has two black bands on the dorsal fin while the caudal fin may be plain or have dark margins. They are sexually dimorphic with the females having fuller, rounder bellies than the males, the males develop a red inside of the mouth during the spawning season and both sexes develop tubercules on the head and snout when breeding, although these are more obvious in the males. They grow to 15 cm standard length. Distribution The Cambodian logsucker is found in the Mekong of Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, it also occurs in the Mae Klong, Chao Phraya and the river systems of south eastern Thailand in Phrae, Phitsanulok, Ubon Ratchathani, Trang, Chanthaburi, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Sawan, Yala, Chiang Rai and Surat Thani provinces of Thailand and in Peninsular Malaysia, it may also occur in south eastern Mymanmar. Habits and ecology The Cambodian logsucker is found in rapidly flowing, small to medium sized streams with rocky beds, in submontane to hill regions, it may also occur in larger rivers, and even occasionally in lowland rivers. At the start of the monsoon they move into floodplains or paddy fields where they breed, the fry are cared for by the parents until they are juveniles at which point the fish return to the streams. It feeds on periphyton, phytoplankton and some insects. They are relatively sociable in the wild and can be found in loose shoals where the fish form a hierarchy, when there are disputes the fish charge each other, flare their fins, become paler in colour, and the males extend their rostral processes. Human usage The Cambodian logsucker is consumed locally by humans where it occurs and in some area sit is a popular food species when spawning. It is common in the aquarium trade but it has to be induced to breed using hormones in captivity.

Murray was a member of the Canadian national ski cross team for 6 years. She was a FIS World Championships silver medalist in 2011. She competed in the 2010 Olympic Winter Games for the debut of Ski Cross and came 12th with an injured knee. As a result of her knee injuries, Murray retired from competitive sport in 2012. Personal Murray's parents were both members of Canadian national ski teams. Her father was Dave Murray one of the original Crazy Canucks who were famous on the downhill ski circuit in the 70s and 80s. Murray's mother was Stephanie Sloan a three time world champion in freestyle skiing. Sloan competed in all three disciplines of Moguls, Aerials, and Ski Ballet. When Murray was 22 months old, her father died from skin cancer. Murray started her own superfood cereal business, Jules Fuel Whistler Superfood, and is studying to become a Holistic Nutritionist. She started the Ski with An Olympian program with Whistler Blackcomb. In 2018, Murray married fellow Canadian freestyle skier Davey Barr. Career She began her young career with World Cup starts where she finished the 2008–09 World Cup tour 6th and ended up fourth in the 09-10 World Cup. Murray was a member of the Canadian Olympic team that took place in Vancouver near her hometown of Whistler. One week before Winter X Games XIV Julia Murray suffered a grade 1 tear of her medial collateral ligament and a tear of her medial meniscus during training. This caused her to miss the X Games although she did attend and watched as national teammates Ashleigh McIvor and Kelsey Serwa finished second and third. It was unknown whether or not she would attend the Olympics as a result of the injury. On Tuesday February 2, 2010 Murray underwent arthroscopic surgery and stated that she believed that she will recover in time to race in the ski cross events at the Olympics. At the Olympics Murray qualified for the quarter-finals, however she was skiing in obvious discomfort and failed to qualify for the semi-finals. After the race she told CTV \\"My knee did things I did not think it could do, and it hurt quite a bit\\". Over the course of the next season Murray still struggled with her injured knee. She did achieve success in spite of this when she won the silver medal at the 2011 World Championships, finishing second behind teammate Serwa. However a second knee injury put her out for the year and from the 2011–12 season. Murray took the time off to properly recuperate and spend some time on her education, she was worried that she had rushed back to early on the last injury, thus she wanted to be one hundred percent sure she was ready when she returned from her second injury. Due to the injuries suffered during her young career, Murray decided to retire in June 2012 at the age of 23. McIvor, her teammate and Olympic gold medalist also retired later that year as a result of injuries.
