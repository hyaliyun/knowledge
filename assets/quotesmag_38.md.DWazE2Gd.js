In some cultures a professional matchmaker may be used to find a spouse for a young person. Arranged marriages have historically been prominent in many cultures. The practice remains common in many regions, notably South Asia, though in many other parts of the world, the practice has declined substantially during the 19th and 20th centuries. Forced marriages, practised in some families, are condemned by the United Nations, and is not an arranged marriage. The specific sub-category of forced child marriage is especially condemned. In other cultures people mostly choose their own partner. History Arranged marriages were very common throughout the world until the 18th century.Jodi O'Brien (2008), Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, page 40-42, Typically, marriages were arranged by parents, grandparents or other relatives. Some historical exceptions are known, such as courtship and betrothal rituals during the Renaissance period of Italy and Gandharva Vivah in the Vedic period of India.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, James G. Lochtefeld (2001), , Page 427 In China, arranged marriages (baoban hunyin, ÂåÖÂäûÂ©öÂßª) ‚Äì sometimes called blind marriages (manghun, Áõ≤Â©ö) ‚Äì were the norm before the mid-20th century. A marriage was a negotiation and decision between parents and other older members of two families. The boy and girl were typically told to get married, without a right to demur, even if they had never met each other until the wedding day.Fricke, Chang, and Yang. (1994).

Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; see Chapter 1 Until the first half of the 20th century, arranged marriages were common in migrant families in the United States. They were sometimes called \\"picture-bride marriages\\" among Japanese-American immigrants because the bride and groom knew each other only through the exchange of photographs before the day of their marriage. These marriages among immigrants were typically arranged by parents, or relatives from the country of their origin. As immigrants settled in and melded into a new culture, arranged marriages shifted first to quasi-arranged marriages where parents or friends made introductions and the couple met before the marriage; over time, the marriages among the descendants of these immigrants shifted to autonomous marriages driven by individual's choice, dating and courtship preferences, along with an increase in interracial marriages.Harry Reis and Susan Sprecher, Encyclopedia of Human Relationships, SAGE Publications, , pages 113‚Äì117Ghimire et al. (2006), Social change, premartial family experience and spouse choice in an arranged marriage society, American Journal of Sociology, 111, pages 1181‚Äì1218 Similar historical dynamics are claimed in other parts of the world.Xiaohe and Whyte (1990), Love matches and arranged marriages: A Chinese replication, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 52, pages 709‚Äì722Tekce (2004), Paths of marriage in Istanbul: arranging choices and choice in arrangements, Ethnography, 5, pages 173‚Äì201 Arranged marriages have declined in prosperous countries with social mobility and increasing individualism; nevertheless, arranged marriages are still seen in countries of Europe and North America, among royal families, aristocrats and minority religious groups such as in placement marriage among Fundamentalist Mormon groups of the United States. In most other parts of the world, arranged marriages continue to varying degrees and increasingly in quasi-arranged form, along with autonomous marriages.  Enforcement  A woman who refuses to go through with an arranged marriage, tries to leave an arranged marriage via divorce or is suspected of any kind of immoral behaviour, may be considered to have dishonored her entire family. This being the case, her male relatives may be ridiculed or harassed and any of her siblings may find it impossible to enter into a marriage. In these cases, killing the woman is a way for the family to enforce the institution of arranged marriages. Unlike cases of domestic violence, honor killings are often done publicly for all to see and there are frequently family members involved in the act. Comparison Marriages have been categorized into four groups in scholarly studies: * Forced Arranged Marriage: parents or guardians select, the individuals are neither consulted nor have any say before the marriage * Consensual Arranged Marriage: parents or guardians select, then the individuals are consulted, who consider and consent, and each individual has the power to refuse; sometimes, the individuals meet ‚Äì in family setting or privately ‚Äì before engagement and marriage as in shidduch custom among Orthodox Jews * Self-Selected Marriage: individuals select, then parents or guardians are consulted, who consider and consent, and where parents or guardians have the power of veto. * Autonomous Marriage: individuals select, the parents or guardians are neither consulted nor have any say before the marriage Gary Lee and Lorene Stone suggest that most adult marriages in recent modern history are somewhere on the scale between consensual arranged and autonomous marriage, in part because marriage is a social institution. Similarly, Broude and Greene, after studying 142 cultures worldwide, have reported that 130 cultures have elements of arranged marriage. Extreme examples of forced arranged marriage have been observed in some societies, particularly in child marriages of girls below age 12. Illustrations include vani which is currently seen in some tribal / rural parts of Pakistan, and Shim-pua marriage Taiwan before the 1970s (Tongyangxi in China). Types There are many kinds of arranged marriages, some of these are:Ghimire, D. J., Axinn, W. G., Yabiku, S. T., & Thornton, A. (2006).

E. (2007). Kissing Cousins, Current Anthropology, 48(5), pages 756‚Äì764 It is one where the bride and groom share a grandparent or near ancestor. Examples of these include first cousin marriages, uncle-niece marriages, second cousin marriages, and so on. The most common consanguineous marriages are first cousin marriages, followed by second cousin and uncle-niece marriages. Between 25 and 40% of all marriages in parts of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are first cousin marriages; while overall consanguineous arranged marriages exceed 65 to 80% in various regions of North Africa and Central Asia.R. Hussain (1999), Community perceptions of reasons for preference for consanguineous marriages in Pakistan, Journal of Biosocial Science, 31, pages 449‚Äì461Consanguineous marriages Brecia Young (2006) The bride and groom in all of the above types of arranged marriages, usually do have the right to consent; if the bride or the groom or both do not have a right to consent, it is called a forced marriage. Forced marriages are not the same as arranged marriages; these forced arrangements do not have the full and free consent of both parties, and no major world religion advocates for forced marriages. Arranged marriages are commonly associated with religion; a few religions that practice this form of marriage include Islam and Judaism. According to The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 of India, non-consensual marriages and marriages where either the bridegroom is below the age of 21 years or the bride is below the age of 18 are prohibited for the Hindus, Buddhist, Sikhs and Jains. Non-consanguineous arranged marriage is one where the bride and groom do not share a grandparent or near ancestor. This type of arranged marriages is common in Hindu and Buddhist South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Christian Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.Derek F. Roberts, N. Fujiki, K.

While consanguineous arranged marriages are common and culturally preferred in some Islamic countries and among migrants from Muslim countries to other parts of the world, they are culturally forbidden or considered undesirable in most Christian, Hindu and Buddhist societies.Alan Bittles, Consanguinity in Context (Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology), Cambridge University Press, Consanguineous arranged marriages were common in Jewish communities before the 20th century, but have declined to less than 10% in modern times.Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), see the article on CONSANGUINITY AMONG JEWS; also see Jacobs, Studies in Jewish Statistics, pp. 1‚Äì9, London, 1891;Cohen et al., Consanguinity, intracommunity and intercommunity marriages in a population sample of Israeli Jews, Ann Hum Biol. 2004 Jan‚ÄìFeb;31(1), pages 38‚Äì48 Causes and prevalence Over human history through modern times, the practice of arranged marriages has been encouraged by a combination of factors, such as the practice of child marriage,Child Marriages World Health Organization, United Nations (7 March 2013) late marriage, tradition,Afghanistan ‚Äì The situation of women and girls UNHCR (2007), pages 45‚Äì46Early Marriage as a barrier to Girl's Education Jeannette Bayisenge, Rwanda (2008) culture, religion, poverty and limited choice, disabilities,Ghai, A.

These child marriages are implicitly arranged marriages.Gupta, G. R. (1976). Love, arranged marriage, and the Indian social structure. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 7(1), pages 75‚Äì85 In rural areas of East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America, poverty and lack of options, such as being able to attend school, leave little choice to children other than be in early arranged marriages. Child marriages are primarily seen in areas of poverty. Parents arrange child marriages to ensure their child's financial security and reinforce social ties. They believe it offers protection and reduces the daughter's economic burden on the family due to how costly it is to feed, clothe and (optionally) educate a girl. By marrying their daughter to a good family, the parents improve their social status by establishing a social bond between each other. According to Warner, in nations with the high rates of child marriages, the marriage of the girl is almost always arranged by her parents or guardians.Warner, Elizabeth (2004), Behind the wedding veil: Child marriage as a form of trafficking in girls. American U Journal Gender Soc. Policy & Law, 12, pages 233‚Äì270 The nations with the highest rates of arranged child marriages are: Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Pakistan.

Retrieved on 2012-04-02. Poverty In impoverished communities, every adult mouth to feed becomes a continuing burden. In many of these cultures, women have difficulty finding gainful employment (or are simply prohibited from doing so), and their daughters become the greatest burden to the family. Some scholars argue that arranging a marriage of a daughter, becomes a necessary means to reduce this burden.Engel, J. W. (1984). Marriage in the People's Republic of China: Analysis of a new law. Journal of Marriage and the Family, pages 955‚Äì961 Poverty, thus, is a driver of arranged marriage.

Caldwell and R. D'Souza (eds.), The Continuing Demographic Transition, Oxford Clarendon Press as a reason for their growing reluctance to see their daughters marry at too early an age. Late marriage Late marriage, particularly past the age of 30 years old, reduces the pool of available women for autonomous marriages. Introductions and arranged marriages become a productive option.Retherford, R. D., Ogawa, N., & Matsukura, R. (2001). Population and Development Review, 27(1), pages 65‚Äì102 For example, in part due to economic prosperity, about 40% of modern Japanese women reach the age of 29 and have never been married. To assist late marriages, the traditional custom of arranged marriages called miai-kekkon is re-emerging. It involves the prospective bride and groom, family, friends and a matchmaker (nak≈çdo, ‰ª≤‰∫∫); the pair is selected by a process with the individuals and family involved (iegara, ÂÆ∂ÊüÑ). Typically the couple meets three times, in public or private, before deciding if they want to get engaged.Applbaum, K.D.

This encourages homogamy and arranged marriages within the ethnic group. Examples of this dynamic include Sikh marriages between 1910 and 1980 in Canada,Kurian, G. (1991). South Asians in Canada.

The marriage created an alliance between Louis XIV of France and the Duke of Savoy. Arranged marriages across feudal lords, city states and kingdoms, as a means of establishing political alliances, trade and peace were common in human history.Harris, B. J. (1989).

University of California, Berkeley When a king married his son to a neighboring state's daughter, it indicated an alliance among equals, and signaled the former's state superiority. For example, the fourth daughter of Maria Theresa, Queen of Austria and Hungary, Marie Antoinette, married the dauphin (crown prince) of France, who would become King Louis XVI. Wealth and inheritance issues Throughout most of human history, marriage has been a social institution that produced children and organized inheritance of property from one generation to next. Various cultures, particularly some wealthy royals and aristocratic families, arranged marriages in part to conserve or streamline the inheritance of their wealth.Coontz, S. (2006). Marriage, a history: How love conquered marriage. Penguin Tongyangxi, also known as Shim-pua marriage in Taiwanese ‚Äì literally child or little daughter-in-law ‚Äì was a tradition of arranged marriage, in which a poor family would arrange and marry a pre-adolescent daughter into a richer family as a servant.Judd, E. R. (1989). Niangjia: Chinese women and their natal families. Journal of Asian Studies, 48(3), pages 525‚Äì544 The little girl provided slave-like free labor, and also the daughter- in-law to the adoptive family's son. This sort of arranged marriage, in theory, enabled the girl to escape poverty and the wealthy family to get free labor and a daughter-in-law. Zhaozhui was a related custom by which a wealthy family that lacked an heir would arrange marriage of a boy child from another family. The boy would move in with the wealthy family, take on the surname of the new family, and marry the family's daughter. Such arranged marriages helped maintain inheritance bloodlines. Similar matrilocal arranged marriages to preserve wealth inheritance were common in Korea, Japan and other parts of the world.Martin, L. G. (1990).

Greenwood Publishing Group; see pages 30‚Äì31 Bride-wealth In many cultures, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East, daughters are valuable on the marriage market because the groom and his family must pay cash and property for the right to marry the daughter. This is termed as bride-wealth and locally by various names such as Lobola and Wine Carrying.Wining back our good luck: bridewealth in nowadays Maputo Paulo Granjo (2004)Bride price: an insult to women, a burden to men?, BBC News (August 30, 2004) The bride-wealth is typically kept by the bride's family, after the marriage, and is a source of income to poor families. The brothers, father, and male relatives of the bride typically take keen interest in arranging her marriage to a man who is willing to pay the most wealth in exchange for the right to marry her.Margrethe Silberschmidt (1999), Women Forget that Men are the Masters, Nordic Africa Institute, , pp 87Stephanie Beswick (2001), \\" We Are Bought Like Clothes\\": The War Over Polygyny and Levirate Marriage in South Sudan, Northeast African Studies, 8(2), pp 35‚Äì61, Quote ‚Äì \\"The highest bidder usually acquires the woman, and the bridewealth is made in a series of payments.\\" Religion Some religious denominations recognize marriages only within the faith.

These fears have been stoked by observed divorces once the minimum married residence period requirement is met. MP Ann Cryer has alleged examples of such abuse by West Asian Muslim families in her motion to the UK's House of Commons.Multi- cultural sensitivity is not an excuse for moral blindness, Hansard, 10 February 1999; column 256‚Äì280 The United States has seen a similar controversy with sham arranged marriages.David Seminara (2008) Hello, I Love You, Won't You Tell Me Your Name: Inside the Green Card Marriage Phenomenon Center for Immigration StudiesMORE WEDDING RING BUSTS Green-card scam probe widens Brian Harmon, New York Daily News (August 16, 2002) Human rights Various international organizations, including UNICEF, have campaigned for laws to ban arranged marriages of children, as well as forced marriages.Child Marriages UNICEF Article 15 and 16 of The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) specifically cover marriage and family law, which support such as ban.Freeman, Marsha (1995).

Activists, such as Charlotte Bunch, suggest that marriages arranged by parents and other family members typically assume heterosexual preference and involve emotional pressure; this drives some individuals into marriages that they consent under duress. Bunch suggests that all marriages should be autonomous. In contrast, preventing arranged marriages may harm many individuals who want to get married and can benefit from parental participation in finding and selecting a mate. For example, Willoughby suggests that arranged marriages work because they remove anxiety in process of finding the spouses. Parents, families and friends provide an independent perspective when they participate in learning and evaluating the other person, past history, behavior, as well as the couple's mutual compatibility. Willoughby further suggests that parents and family provide more than input in the screening and selection process; often, they provide financial support for the wedding, housing, emotional support and other valuable resources for the couple as they navigate past the wedding into married life, and help raise their children. Michael Rosenfeld says that the differences between autonomous marriages and arranged marriages are empirically small; many people meet, date and choose to marry or cohabit with those who are similar in background, age, interests and social class they feel most similar to, screening factors most parents would have used for them anyway. Assuming the pool from which mates are screened and selected is large, Rosenfeld suggests that the differences between the two approaches to marriages are not as great as some imagine them to be. Others have expressed sentiments similar to Rosenfeld.Is arranged marriage really any worse than craigslist? Anita Jain, New York Magazine (2013) Stability Divorce rates have climbed in the European Union and the United States with increase in autonomous marriage rates. The lowest divorce rates in the world are in cultures with high rates of arranged marriages such as Amish culture of United States (1%),Trip back in time: the Amish in Ohio St Louis Post-Dispatch (September 10, 2010) Hindus of India (3%), and Ultra-Orthodox Jews of Israel (7%). According to a 2012 study by Statistic Brain, 53.25 percent of marriages are arranged worldwide. The global divorce rate for arranged marriages was 6.3 percent, which could be an indicator for the success rate of arranged marriages. This has led scholars to ask if arranged marriages are more stable than autonomous marriages, and whether this stability matters. Others suggest that the low divorce rate may not reflect stability, rather it may reflect the difficulty in the divorce process and social ostracism to the individuals, who choose to live in a dysfunctional marriage rather than face the consequences of a divorce. Also, the perception of high divorce rates attributed to self- arranged marriages in the United States is being called into question while the Hindus in India continue to enjoy low divorce rates. Love and respect in arranged versus autonomous marital life Various small sample surveys have been done to ascertain if arranged marriages or autonomous marriages have a more satisfying married life. The results are mixed ‚Äì some state marriage satisfaction is higher in autonomous marriages, others find no significant differences.See:  * Johnson and Bachan have questioned the small sample size and conclusions derived from them. ScholarsPaul Amato (2012), in Marriage at the Crossroads: Law, Policy, and the Brave New World;Editors: Marsha Garrison, Elizabeth S. Scott; ; see Chapter 6 ask whether love and respect in marital life is greater in arranged marriages than autonomous marriages.

Established at The New School in 1992 during a time of rousing public debates about freedom of speech, the arts, and society's relationship to art, the Center explores the role of the arts in developing a civic culture of tolerance and pluralism in the United States, and curates and supports new roles for the arts and artists in advancing social justice. Through public programs and classes, prizes and fellowships, publications and exhibitions that probe some of the pressing issues of our time, the Center champions the arts as expressions of the political moments from which they emerge, considering the intersection between art and politics the space where new forms of civic engagement must be developed. They are the only university-based institution committed exclusively to leading public research on this intersection. The first program series launched at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics was the Sustaining Democracy Series, a lecture program that examined the role of art in pushing forward controversial political issues and opening public debate, including government sponsorship of art, censorship and the roles of artists and citizens. The Vera List Center for Art and Politics was founded with an endowment from university life trustee Vera G. List out of her deep interest in the intersection of education, art, and politics. Carin Kuoni is the Director / Chief Curator. Mission A leader in the field of art and politics, the Vera List Center for Art and Politics serves a critical mission: to foster a vibrant and diverse community of artists, scholars, and policy makers who take creative, intellectual, and political risks to bring about positive change. Centered around the notion that art is politically valiant, the Center aims to make the case that art must play a significant, unusual, and different role in political environments than it does in other forms of expression - a role that is poignant, groundbreaking, and inspiring. The Vera List Center for Art and Politics is a W.A.G.E. Certified organization. W.A.G.E. Certification is a national program initiated and operated by the nonprofit Working Artists and the Greater Economy that publicly recognizes nonprofit arts organizations demonstrating a history of, and commitment to, voluntarily paying artist fees that meet the minimum payment standards. Focus theme The Vera List Center for Art and Politics develops their programs in cycles, habitually identifying a topic of particular urgency and broad resonance that brings together artists, scholars, activists, public intellectuals, and political and cultural leaders to discuss and explore thematic issues and questions, through a variety of programs, over the course of four semesters. The first annual theme for 2004‚Äì05 was Homeland, followed by Considering Forgiveness in 2005‚Äì06, The Public Domain in 2006‚Äì07, Agency in 2007‚Äì08, Branding Democracy in 2008‚Äì09, Speculating on Change in 2009‚Äì10, Thingness in 2011‚Äì13, Alignment in 2013-2015, and Post Democracy in 2015‚Äì17. The current theme for 2018-2020 is If Art is Politics. Public events The Vera List Center organizes panel discussions, lectures, conferences, workshops, and online programs that are created in consultation with the center's advisory committee and with current and former fellows. Occasionally, the VLC produces exhibitions. All VLC initiatives are driven by the live encounter of artists, scholars, historians and other thinkers and makers who together consider topics of broad popular relevance. From these live events spring additional programs such as those featured on the Vera List Center website, including Art & Research Projects, Publications, and others. Vera List Center Prize Launched to recognize the center's 20th anniversary, the Vera List Center Prize for Art and Politics honors an artist or group of artists who has taken great risks to advance social justice in profound and visionary ways. International in scope, the biennial prize is awarded for a particular project's long-term impact, boldness, and artistic excellence. The prize initiative unfolds across various platforms and over an extended period of time. It serves as a catalyst for activities that illuminate the important role of the arts in society, and strengthen teaching and learning at The New School in art and design, social science, philosophy, and civic engagement. More than a single moment of recognition, it represents a long-term commitment to the question of how the arts advance social justice, how we speak of, evaluate and teach such work. An exhibition of the winning project, a conference, integration into classes, and a publication featuring select nominated projects complement a cash award and short-term New York City residency for the honoree. In the spirit of the center's twenty-year history, the prize provides the opportunity for an ongoing public conversation on art and social justice as a global issue that engages audiences in New York City, nationally and around the world. The Vera List Center Prize has been renamed The Jane Lombard Prize for Art and Social Justice, starting with the 2018-2020 biennial prize cycle. Prize winners 2018-2020 Prize Winner: Chimurenga The jury was delighted to bestow the 2018-2020 Jane Lombard Prize for Art and Social Justice on Chimurenga, the Pan African collective who have boldly and unapologetically reclaimed the African imaginary. Chimurenga invests in deep research on history, representation and culture through a methodology of collective remobilization of knowledge. The artistic process is a forward reimagining of the global polity, through a multiplicity of forms, eschewing the separation of various art forms from one another and from wider social and political practices. This includes the Pan African Space Station, the roaming Chimurenga library and the periodical Chronic, which incorporate the sonic, performative and written experiences in digital and physical spaces through which the project decenters and recreates new centers of knowledge. It reflects on the collective political histories and memories in the pan African community that is world-making. Founded by Ntone Edjabe in 2002, Chimurenga performs as a pan-African platform that promotes voices of culture, arts and politics from Africa. As one of Chimurenga's outputs, Pan African Space Station (PASS) is an online radio station and pop-up studio, simultaneously, \\"a performance and exhibition space; a research platform and living archive.\\" Developed by Chimurenga in collaboration with musician and composer Neo Muyanga in 2008, PASS is a virtual and material space that reflects on the collective political histories and memories in the Pan-African community. With its slogan \\"There are other worlds out there they never told you about,\\" the interdisciplinary station intersects sound, music and words, further engages in conversations including art and technology, community and borders, utopia and oppression. As an internet based radio station, PASS explores the possibilities of creating new knowledge across distributed networks of time and space. Through live performance, stories about music in Africa and archival exhibitions, PASS plays a significant role in challenging existing ideas about Africa and bringing unique aspects of the interconnection between music and history. At the same time, PASS also expands its projects to physical spaces such as cities of Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Helsinki and Cairo. Chimurenga uses a metaphorical term \\"landing\\" to emphasize the ways in which the virtual \\"space station\\" enters into physical spaces. Upon landing each city, Chimurenga collaborates with local cultural producers to organize conferences, festivals and exhibitions. As such PASS is a catalyst for idea- sharing and innovation of African art and culture. As noted on its website, PASS investigates \\"how we locate ourselves and how we mediate our human and historic commonality.\\" Press: Art Forum Dallas Art Dealers Association Art&Education; Brittle Paper ART COLLECTION ArtNews Contemporary And Art News Philanthropy New York HRMS.NEWS Emily Carr News APOLLO Roberto Bunini 2016-2018 Prize Winner: Maria Thereza Alves Brazilian artist Maria Thereza Alves' research-based practice, literally and metaphorically holds open a space at the intersection of art and science to challenge and think expansively about the social history and possible futures that germinating seeds hold within themselves. Though her project Seeds of Change Alvs explores the social, political and cultural history of ballast flora in port cities and, in so doing, reveals patterns, temporalities and instruments of colonialism, commerce and migration going back many centuries. Seeds of Change is a long-term project that so far has been presented in several European port cities ‚Äì Marseille, Liverpool, and Bristol among them. It examines the legacies of colonialism and the global commerce of goods and people through the displacement of plants, focusing on the scientific, social and political history of ballast, the waste material used to stabilize ships in maritime trade and dumped in ports at the end of the ships' passages. Ballast contains \\"dormant\\" seeds that can remain viable in the soil for hundreds of years before germinating and growing. As Alves grows young plants from these dormant seeds ‚Äì often in floating barges or gardens, developed in collaboration with local communities and scientists ‚Äì she examines how we understand the identity of a place and its sociopolitical histories. As such the project questions the official accounts of culture as well as the lands it is built on and through.

Throughout the course of the 18-month collaboration, the Vera List Center and Abounaddara worked together to bring the collective's work to the United Nations where there was a panel discussion on civilian representation and freedom of speech in Syria. The final culmination of the prize initiative, titled, ‚ÄúAbounaddara. The Right To The Image‚Äù was a series of events consisting of a gallery exhibition, conference and various film screenings, that explored the ways in which civilians are represented in times of conflict. Emerging from the civil uprising in 2011, Abounaddara is known for its ‚Äúemergency cinema‚Äù which seeks to transcend mainstream war reporting. The collective's work highlights individuals, coming from all sides of the conflict to remind viewers both of the daily life and complexity of the civil war unfolding in Syria. Their weekly video vignettes published on their Vimeo account are intimate, jarring, and poignant. Abounaddara's driving force within their work is the belief in the ‚Äúright to the image‚Äù which they define as upholding the dignity of civilians who otherwise might not have a say in how they are represented.

Theaster Gates: A Way of Working was an 18-month collaboration between the artist and The New School that culminated into a two-day forum and gallery presentation. This exhibition examined the ways in which the artist develops synergies with his work and the complexities of working in an expanded studio practice within the institutional framework. The exhibition featured several works of the artist including drawing, sculpture, installation and video. Theaster Gates, an American artist, activist and Artistic Director for the Rebuild Foundation, focuses his work on political enfranchisement, historical reclamation, and social inclusion. His Dorchester Projects started in 2006 with the transformation of two buildings into community gathering spaces on Chicago's South Side.

For the duration of the war, she served in the 2nd Naval District, patrolling the New England coastline between New London, Connecticut and Block Island Sound. After February 1919, she operated from New London with the Reserve Squadron, anti-submarine Squadrons, engaged in training missions.

The WHSAA was founded in the 1920s to regulate athletic competition between Wyoming's high schools. The organization has since grown to assist other interscholastic activities such as drama and music. Classification The WHSAA divides schools based upon enrollment of grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 for competition and state and regional championships. For most sports including football, basketball, and volleyball schools are divided in one of four classes, 4A, 3A, 2A, or 1A. The schools having the highest enrollment are put into class 4A and those with lower enrollment are put in other classes. In other sports like soccer and swimming, there are only two classes, 4A and 3A, while in golf, cross country and wrestling there are three classes, 4A, 3A, and 2A. For other sports, including tennis, indoor track and skiing, there are no classes. Events Many of the championships for sports activities are held in one central place, while other are held in different locations and these change from year to year. Championship events that are held in one central location include the following. *Football - held at War Memorial Stadium (Wyoming) on the campus of The University of Wyoming in Laramie *Basketball - held at The Casper Events Center and The Swede Erickson Thunderbird Gym on the campus of Casper College both in Casper - Tournaments are split between two weekends with the 1A/2A schools competing the first weekend and the 3A/4A schools competing the second weekend *Track and Field - held at Harry Geldien Stadium on the Campus of Kelly Walsh High School in Casper *Volleyball - held at The Casper Events Center and The Swede Erickson Thunderbird Gym on the campus of Casper College both in Casper *Wrestling - held at The Casper Events Center in Casper Sanctioned activities The WHSAA classifies its activities into athletic and non-athletic events. ; Non- Athletic Events *Art *DECA (organization) *Drama *FBLA *FCCLA *The National FFA Organization *Journalism *Marching Band *Music *SkillsUSA *Speech *Spirit Activities *Student Council ; Athletic Events *Alpine Skiing *Basketball *Cross Country *Football *Golf *Indoor Track *Nordic Skiing *Soccer *Swimming *Tennis *Track & Field *Girls Volleyball *Wrestling ReferencesExternal links *Official site Category:Education in Wyoming Category:High school sports associations in the United States Category:Sports organizations established in the 1920s Category:Sports in Wyoming Category:1920s establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Wyoming High School Activities Association"},{"id":"26503637","text":"Commonwealth is a book by autonomous Marxist theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. It completes a trilogy which includes Empire and Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire. The influence of the book has paralleled the rise of the \\"common\\" as a concept at the center of the political and cultural debate.Carlo Freccero (2011) Todo cambia con la tv sul web in Il Fatto Quotidiano, 9 July 2011 quotation:  Overview  In Part 1 of the book the authors introduce the concept of \\"the republic of property\\". As such they state that \\"What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defense of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property\\".Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. Commonwealth. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.15 In Part 2 the authors deal with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and end up proposing what they call \\"altermodernity\\". Altermodernity \\"involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project.\\"Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. Commonwealth. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.107 Reception For Alex Callinicos, \\"what is newest in Commonwealth is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also \\"the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships\\", which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public.\\"Commonwealth. Book Review by Alex Callinicos, March 2010 For David Harvey, Negri and Hardt are \\"in the search of an altermodernity-something that is outside the dialectical opposition between modernity and anti-modernity-they need a means of escape. The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism-working within a different set of dimensions.\\"David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. An exchange on Commonweatlh in Artforum. November 2009. Also Harvey notes that \\"Revolutionary thought, Hardt and Negri argue, must find a way to contest capitalism and \\"the republic of property.\\" It \\"should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it,\\" because it is the \\"primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty.\\"David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. An exchange on Commonweatlh in Artforum. November 2009. In the same exchange in Artforum between Harvey and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of Commonwealth. As such they state that \\"We instead define the concept of singularity, contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time - that is, a process of becoming.\\"David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

He attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1955. Korean War In 1951, following China's entry into the Korean War, Nie commanded the East China Military Region Air Force and the People's Volunteer Army's short-lived Bomber Command at Dongfeng in Jilin province.. After Li Zhen returned to China in July 1952, Nie commanded the PLAAF in Korea.. Taiwan Strait Crises At the time of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, Nie commanded the East China (Huadong) Air Force.. During the Crisis, he served as vice-commander of the Zhejiang Front Command (ZFC)‚Äîestablished in 1954 by order of Mao Zedong and led by Zhang Aiping‚Äîand commanded the ZFC air force. He was one of the architects of the campaign to capture the Dachen Islands from the Republic of China. During a meeting of the ZFC commanders on 31 August 1954, Nie opposed the \\"majority opinion\\" favoring an immediate amphibious invasion of Dachen, and instead supported the \\"limited piecemeal tactics\\" proposed by Zhang. The resulting \\"Zhang-Nie plan\\" involved a focus on Yijiangshan Island, north of Dachen, and led to the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands in January 1955.

The fragments of a molecule cause a unique pattern in the mass spectrum. These reactions are well documented over the decades and fragmentation pattern is useful to determine the molar weight and structural information of the unknown molecule. Fragmentation that occurs in tandem mass spectrometry experiments has been a recent focus of research as this data helps facilitate the identification of molecules. Toluene Fragmentation  Mass spectrometry techniques  Fragmentation can occur in the ion source (in-source fragmentation) where it is generally considered an undesired effect since ion source conformation is an important criterion in the level of fragmentation observed. Desired fragmentation is typically made in the collision zone (post-source fragmentation) of a tandem mass spectrometer. However, Enhanced In-Source Fragmentation/Annotation (EISA) has recently been shown to promote in-source fragmentation to create fragment ions that are consistent with tandem mass spectrometers. EISA and collision-induced dissociation (CID) among other physical events that impact ions are a part of gas phase ion chemistry. A few different types of mass fragmentation are collision-induced dissociation (CID) through collision with neutral molecule, surface-induced dissociation (SID) using fast moving ions collision with a solid surface, laser induced dissociation which uses laser to induce the ion formation, electron-capture dissociation (ECD) due to capturing of low energy electrons, electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) through electron transfer between ions, negative electron-transfer dissociation (NETD), electron- detachment dissociation (EDD), photodissociation, particularly infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) using IR radiation for the bombardment and blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD) which use IR radiation instead of laser, Higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD), EISA, and charge remote fragmentation.  Fragmentation reactions  Fragmentation is a type of chemical dissociation, in which the removal of the electron from the molecule results in ionization. Removal of electrons from either sigma bond, pi bond or nonbonding orbitals causes the ionization. This can take place by a process of homolytic cleavage/ homolysis or heterolytic cleavage/ heterolysis of the bond. Relative bond energy and the ability to undergo favorable cyclic transition states affect the fragmentation process. Rules for the basic fragmentation processes are given by Stevenson‚Äôs Rule. Homolysis Heterolysis Two major categories of bond cleavage patterns are simple bond cleavage reactions and rearrangement reactions. Simple bond cleavage reactions Majority of organic compounds undergo simple bond cleavage reactions, in which, direct cleavage of bond take place. Sigma bond cleavage, radical site- initiated fragmentation, and charge site-initiated fragmentation are few types of simple bond cleavage reactions. An example of sigma bond cleavage = Sigma bond cleavage / œÉ-cleavage = Sigma bond cleavage is most commonly observed in molecules, which can produce stable cations such as saturated alkanes, secondary and tertiary carbocations. This occurs when an alpha electron is removed. The C-C bond elongates and weakens causing fragmentation. Fragmentation at this site produces a charged and a neutral fragment. An example of radical site-initiated fragmentation = Radical site-initiated fragmentation = Sigma bond cleavage also occurs on radical cations remote from the site of ionization. This is commonly observed in alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, amines, alkenes and aromatic compounds with a carbon attached to ring. The cation has a radical on a heteroatom or an unsaturated functional group. The driving force of fragmentation is the strong tendency of the radical ion for electron pairing. Cleavage occurs when the radical and an odd electron from the bonds adjacent to the radical migrate to form a bond between the alpha carbon and either the heteroatom or the unsaturated functional group. The sigma bond breaks; hence this cleavage is also known as homolytic bond cleavage or Œ±-cleavage. An example of charge site-initiated fragmentation = Charge site-initiated cleavage = The driving force of charge site- initiated fragmentation is the inductive effect of the charge site in radical cations. The electrons from the bond adjacent to the charged-bearing atom migrate to that atom, neutralizing the original charge and causing it to move to a different site. This term is also called inductive cleavage and is an example of heterolytic bond cleavage. An example of McLafferty Rearrangement Rearrangement reactions  Rearrangement reactions are fragmentation reactions that form new bonds producing an intermediate structure before cleavage. One of the most studied rearrangement reaction is the McLafferty rearrangement / Œ≥-hydrogen rearrangement. This occurs in the radical cations with unsaturated functional groups, like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, olefins, phenylalkanes. During this reaction, Œ≥-hydrogen will transfer to the functional group at first and then subsequent Œ±, Œ≤-bond cleavage of the intermediate will take place. Other rearrangement reactions include heterocyclic ring fission (HRF), benzofuran forming fission (BFF), quinone methide (QM) fission or Retro Diels-Alder (RDA).Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Sequencing Proanthocyanidins.

It was designed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and was administered by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The program consisted of two streams: *Home Insulation Program, which was beset by controversy when the deaths of four workers in separate incidents were linked to the program, and the government under-estimated the level of risk involved; and *Solar Hot Water Rebate Program. Other programs that were closely tied in with the Energy Efficient Homes Package were the Green Loans Scheme (changed to the Green Loans Program and then the Green Start program, and later abolished), Living Greener, National Solar Schools, and the National Rainwater and Greywater Initiative (administered by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities). Home Insulation Program The Home Insulation Program was beset by controversy when the deaths of four workers in separate incidents were linked to the program and electricians warned that poor installation of metallic foil insulation could lead to further deaths or injury through electrocution. In response, the program was discontinued on 19 February 2010 and was replaced, for the interim, by the Insulation Workers' Adjustment Package which provided assistance to support the retention of insulation workers in the insulation industry or related industries until the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme commenced on 1 June 2010. Circumstances of the deaths Four workers died in separate incidents: Matthew Fuller and Mitchell Sweeney were electrocuted installing foil lined insulation, Ruben Barnes was electrocuted installing fibreglass \\"pink batts\\",Coronial findings ‚Äì Matthew James FULLER, Rueben Kelly BARNES and Mitchell Scott SWEENEY while Marcus Wilson died from hyperthermia, also installing \\"pink batts\\". Fuller, a 25-year-old qualified electrician, died on 6 December 2009. Electrocution was due to a metal staple creating an electrical contact between the metal foil insulation being installed and live 240-volt AC electrical wiring. He had been booked in to complete the \\"Ceiling Installers Program\\" induction course but it had been postponed due to a prior personal commitment. His employer was of the view the laying of foil insulation with metal staples was not a high-risk practice for him as an electrician. Sweeney, a 22-year-old experienced insulation installer, was similarly electrocuted due to a metal staple contacting live electrical wiring. He had completed the \\"Ceiling Installers Program\\", which was regarded by his employer as having provided adequate safety training. After the death of Fuller, government regulations required the use of plastic staples. However, Sweeney possessed his own staple gun designed for metal staples and preferred to use metal staples since he found they made installation faster. Barnes, a 16-year-old apprentice carpenter, was electrocuted installing fibreglass insulation. He most likely came into contact with a metal ceiling batten which was floating at main's voltage due to contact with live electrical wiring. The wiring had been unusually placed during construction of the building, and subsequently, a screw used to attach fibreboard to the batten had penetrated its sheath, creating a dangerous hazard for anyone entering the roof space with the mains power switched on. Barnes had no specific safety training, with his employer believing that his previous experience as an apprentice carpenter was adequate. Wilson, aged 19, died of complications related to hyperthermia on 21 November 2009. He was working in , a suburb in western Sydney, where temperatures had climbed to over . Despite some training at TAFE in installing insulation, Wilson had little experience and was filling in for a friend, unbeknownst to the friend's employer. Wilson was accompanied by an experienced installer, who removed roof tiles to provide some ventilation. However, the high ambient temperature and the strenuous work involved with lifting fibreglass \\"pink batts\\" into the roof space appear to have caused Wilson to become dehydrated. He was provided with a caffeinated soft drink by the homeowner, at his request, and his coworker encouraged him to take breaks as required. His coworker then told him to go and wait in the cabin of the truck they were using. Wilson apparently went to the truck, only to return to the roof space, having left his bag behind in the truck. The presence of the bag there gave the impression to the coworker that Wilson had walked off due to being disgruntled about the heat. The coworker went driving in search of Wilson when in fact Wilson had collapsed in the roof space and was found by the homeowner. He was rushed by ambulance to hospital where he later died. The first coronial inquest was held in New South Wales for Wilson's death. The findings by the deputy coroner Hugh Dillon carefully avoided any political aspects and focused on the immediate circumstances of the incident. A subsequent inquest by the Queensland coroner, Michael Barnes, a former tabloid journalist who worked for Rupert Murdoch, found that the risk of electrocution \\"was not appreciated\\" by government authorities at the outset of the home insulation program, despite it being raised by industry representatives. The coroner also referred the supervisors and employers of the three tradesmen to the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions. Benefits of program The insulation program covered 1.2 million homes and it has been estimated that by 2015 it will have produced savings of approximately of electricity and of natural gas savings. All installations were conducted by private contractors as selected by home owners. In Victoria, which has a high proportion of household gas space heating, a study on gas heating concluded that \\"the HIP program led to a reduction in energy consumption equivalent to delaying consumption growth by two years at a calculated abatement cost of AUD 238/tonne CO2-e, assuming no indirect or economy-wide rebound; however, any reduction in daily peak demand is not evident using the linear regression peak demand analysis.\\" Minister's responsibilities On 26 February 2010, Peter Garrett, the government Minister in charge of the program, and his Department, had the Home Insulation Program removed from their area of responsibilities. Greg Combet, the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was given the role of administering the transition between the Home Insulation Program and the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme. Penny Wong was responsible for all other programs, such as the Green Loans Program, Green Start, Solar Schools, and Solar Cities. The Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme was administered by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, prior to its abolition. In May 2010, it was revealed that during 2009 Minister Garrett wrote to Prime Minister Rudd on several occasions raising concerns about unacceptably high health and safety risks; including advising the Prime Minister weeks before the three young tradesmen died. Alleged fraud Allegations of fraud under the program were later made, with three cases forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. In March 2010 the Federal Government announced a proposal to remove foil insulation or make it safe from houses and undertake another inspections. In March 2011, 35 search warrants were executed targeting alleged fraud by businesses and individuals in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Minister, Greg Combet, stated that the Government is to pursue those alleged unscrupulous operators who had fraudulently abused this program. Australian National Audit Office The Auditor-General, Ian McPhee, identified shortcomings in the way the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts handled the program's implementation as it faced pressure from to establish the program during the height of the global financial crisis. The report stated that the department requested the program be rolled out over five years but that this request was denied because of the desire to stimulate the economy and create jobs. McPhee also reported the department underestimated the level of risk involved in an unregulated industry which used inexperienced workers to install insulation in ceiling spaces, McPhee stated: At its peak, demand for the program more than doubled original expectations. In his report, McPhee stated that as problems mounted, the then minister, Peter Garrett, did not have his requests for information answered promptly and then, when it was provided, it was \\"overly optimistic\\" and contained factual errors. The Auditor-General did not make any recommendations because the program was closed by the time he reported. Scheme expiration On 22 April 2010, the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, announced that the Federal Government would abandon the scheme that was planned to replace the Home Insulation Program. Combet also revealed that about half of the rebate claims did not comply with the program rules. The replacement scheme was axed after advice from former Secretary of the Defence Department, Dr Allan Hawke. The cost of the Home Insulation program was estimated to have cost around $1 billion and another $1 ‚Äì $1.5 billion was needed to rectify the problems associated with the program. Compensation In May 2010, the Federal Government announced that it would give cash handouts of up to $500,000 to insulation companies affected by the abolition of the rebate scheme. Combet said applications had opened for a $15 million compensation fund. The Government said reputable companies would receive a cash payment calculated at 15 per cent of the total value of their stock, assistance will not be provided to companies with foil insulation products. Legal action On 6 May 2010, the Queensland's Department of Justice and Attorney-General charged QHI Installations (based in Beenleigh), its director, and its manager under the . On 29 June 2010 Queensland's Justice Department charged Arrow Property Maintenance Pty Ltd (based in Rockhampton), for alleged breaches of the Electrical Safety Act and the Workplace Health and Safety Act, 1995 for allegedly failing to run its business safely. Royal Commission On 12 December 2013, the Attorney-General George Brandis and the Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt announced that the Governor-General has authorised the establishment of a Royal Commission to \\"inquire and report into the deaths, serious injuries and impacts on longstanding home insulation businesses alleged to have arisen from the (Home Insulation) Program\\". On Monday 23 December 2013, the inquiry commenced in Brisbane headed by Ian Hanger . Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Arts Peter Garrett gave evidence. Green Loans scheme On 23 April 2010, Minister Wong announced an audit of approximately assessors of its Green Loans scheme. Assessors linked with the program were audited after reports of potentially fraudulent activities. Breaches were referred to the Australian Federal Police. In August 2010, one hundred assessors lodged claims for compensation after the Green Loans Scheme was axed in early 2010.

The treatise is titled De Grandine et Tonitruis (\\"On Hail and Thunder\\"). Description The inhabitants of this realm were said to travel the clouds in ships and worked with Frankish tempestarii (\\"tempest-raisers\\" or weather-magi) to steal grain from the fields during (magically raised) storms.De Grandine et Tonitruis pp. 8-10: \\"Plerosque autem vidimus et audivimus tanta dementia obrutos, tanta stultitia alienatos, ut credant et dicant quandam esse regionem, qu√¶ dicatur Magonia, ex qua naves veniant in nubibus, in quibus fruges, qu√¶ grandinibus decidunt, et tempestatibus pereunt, vehantur in eamdem regionem, ipsis videlicet nautis a√´reis dantibus pretia tempestariis, et accipientibus frumenta vel ceteras fruges.

Club career Righetti played 10 seasons in the Italian Serie A for A.S. Roma, Udinese, U.S. Lecce, Bari, and Delfino Pescara 1936. He is mostly remembered for his time with Roma under manager Nils Liedholm (1980‚Äì1987), the club with which he made his debut, winning the Serie A title during the 1982‚Äì83 season, as well as three Coppa Italia titles, in 1981, 1984, and 1986. During his Roma career, he also helped the club to reach the final of the 1983‚Äì84 European Cup; he scored in the resulting penalty shootout that Roma eventually lost to Liverpool in the 1984 European Cup Final. Due to his performances in the European Cup with Roma that season, he notably won the Bravo Award in 1984, which is awarded to the best Under-23 played in European Competitions. Despite his talent, Righetti was accused of never fulfilling his potential demonstrated in earlier years, and the later part of his career was much less successful. In 1987, he transferred to Udinese for a season, and he was subsequently sent to Serie B side Lecce; during his time with the club, he was sent briefly on loan to local side Bari, with which he won the Mitropa Cup in 1990, later moving to Pescara the following season. He ended his career after four seasons with the Serie B club, helping the club to obtain promotion to Serie A during the 1991‚Äì92 season, although they would once again be relegated to Serie B the following season.

Originally published in installments on the website Serializer.net in 2002, it was eventually published in its entirety by St. Martin's Press in April 2007. Plot The story is set in 1907 in Paris, surrounding the birth of the Cubism art movement. Someone is murdering various painters, and a group forms to solve the mystery. Fictionalized characters include Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Gertrude Stein, and Erik Satie. Development After The Salon was published by St. Martin's Press, Bertozzi noted that the comic had changed substantially since it was originally published on Serializer.net, with plot points tightened, more than 20 pages cut and about 40 pages added. Reception The Salon has been praised for its \\"rich personalities\\" and \\"brilliant premise\\". Publishers Weekly said the novel was executed \\"with wit and flair. The Salon was named on the Publishers Weekly list of best comics of 2007. Historical accuracy A scene in the book shows Picasso taking inspiration from a comic to complete a portrait of Gertrude Stein. While Picasso was a fan of William Randolph Hearst's comics, there is no historical evidence that they influenced his art. Bertozzi said of the comic, \\"Researching the personalities in The Salon led less to historical accuracy in terms of dates and places, but more, I feel, to an emotional reality\\". Controversy An excerpt of The Salon containing a nude depiction of Picasso was included in a compilation called Alternative Comics No. 2 in 2004. The compilation was given away as part of a promotional event in Rome, Georgia by comic store owner Gordon Lee. The compilation was given to a child, whose parents reported the incident. Lee was soon charged with two counts of \\"distributing material depicting nudity or sexual conduct\\" and five counts of \\"distributing obscene material\\" to a minor. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund noticed the case, and provided Lee's defense. Over $100,000 was spent, and the case was dismissed in April 2008.

His works are generally conventional and stylistically similar to the operas of his teacher Baldassare Galuppi. Although his music largely followed the fashion of his time, he did compose two tunes with unusual time signatures for his day: an air in meter and another in meter. Adolfati studied music composition in Venice with composer Galuppi. After completing his studies he became the maestro di cappella at the Santa Maria della Salute, a position he held until 1745. He then worked in the same capacity at the court in Modena, where his divertimento da camera La pace fra la virt√π e la bellezza premiered in 1746. Around the same time he composed some songs and arias for Johann Adolph Hasse's Lo starnuto di Ercole, which was given at the Teatro San Girolamo (a small theatre located in the Palazzo Labia) in 1745 and during Carnival 1746. In 1748 Adolfati became maestro di cappella at the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa. On 30 May 1760 he became maestro di cappella of the Padua Cathedral, succeeding Giacomo Rampini, who had died three days earlier, in that post.

It was officially released on February 12, 2009. It contains sixteen tracks and a bonus track (\\"Zburator\\"). The only single released is \\"Culeg Vise\\". At first, Seling confirmed a music video for the song, but it wasn't even shot. The single was physically released on March 16, 2009, being broadcast just by Magic FM.  Release and promotion  The album was confirmed in September, 2008, after the releasing of the compilation album \\"1998 - 2008\\". The album's syles were posted on Paula Seling's official website in early 2009. On February 12, 2009 the album was released both as a CD and as a cassette. Digitally it was released in March, 2009. It didn't gain the success of Seling's last albums. Paula's new English album \\"Believe\\" was conceived as an introduction to Paula on the world stage. Hidden on the album are some real jewels, the tracks \\"Autumn in Bucharest\\", \\"Just You\\" and \\"Time to Go\\" are reflections of feelings everyone has experienced at some point in their life and even though the songs seem pop rock, they also feel subtly soulful with a pinch of blues. The title track \\"Believe\\" is a tune about a night on the beach that leaves you reflecting back to your own memories while it also makes you think about making new ones.\\"Believe\\" the album is not all fun and frolic though. Paula also has a serious side. Her song \\"Hey You\\" is a song about over coming emotional abuse and its message is directed at anyone suffering under the weight of personal oppression.\\"Can't You See\\" was written as a message of frustration with the forces of prejudice, racism and sexism and it points out quite eloquently that everyone's life has equal value and that no one person or company should degrade this equality without facing the fact that next, it could be them. Even though mainstream press tries to pretend Romania doesn't exist, there is no denying Paula Seling and \\"Believe\\" has been in the Top 100 albums at CDBaby as well as being in the top 10 in Pop Rock, Pop Piano and Solo Female artist, Believe is quite a display of musical perfection, 17 tracks, covering a wide path through the musical landscape.  Singles  * \\"Culeg Vise\\" is the only song promoted from the album of the same title. It didn't top any official chart.  Track listing  Awards and nominations  The album got an RRA Award for \\"Best Pop Album of the Year\\", in March, 2010. \\"Believe\\" is priced to be affordable worldwide at many currency exchange rates. While the album is inexpensive in the USA, it is with the sole purpose of being affordable in many other countries. The World distribution version of \\"Believe\\" was assembled from 32 bit premasters in a production studio in New Hampshire, USA. The original tracks were recorded In Paula's studio in Bucharest, Romania. There are two versions of Believe with different cover art; * The World Distribution Version of \\"Believe\\" (Aqua seascape background) was professionally mastered in the USA at The SoundLAB at DiscMakers in Philadelphia, PA by Brian Lipski, Senior Mastering Engineer. * The Romanian market version (white cover background) was professionally mastered in Germany by Silver Sound Studios.

He remains an influential figure in art and fashion photography. His work as art director of the UK fashion magazine Nova is widely considered as being influential for its graphic design as well as photography.\\"H.P. by Harry Peccinotti (Book Review), Professional Photographer, 1 June 2009, He published a retrospective of his life's work called book HP (2009). Career Born in London,Vogue Italia, http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/art-photo- design/2011/06/harri-peccinotti his career ranged during the 1950s from commercial artist to musician. At this time he designed record sleeves for Esquire Records and book jackets for Penguin, and later became an advertising art director and photographer. Peccinotti was one of a number of art directors at agencies such as Crawford‚Äôs and J Walter Thompson. In 1965 he was hired as the first Art director of Nova magazine, remembered today for its innovative design, typography, subject matter, photography and quality of witing. Besides his role as art director, he also made photographs for the magazine.\\"Professional Photographer\\" magazine \\"H.P. by Harry Peccinotti Book Review\\", 1 June 2009, http://www.professionalphotographer.co.uk/Legends/Profiles/H-P-by-Harry- Peccinotti At Nova, Peccinotti became one of the first professional fashion photographers to photograph and publish photos of black models, using them extensively in his fashion shoots. He stated in an interview: He also art directed Flair, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and Vogue. He quit art-directing to become a full-time photographer, still creating content for many of the same magazines. His list of regular magazine commissioners grew to include Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, Town, Queen, and Rolling Stone. Peccinotti is also known for his collaborative design of French daily newspaper Le Matin, with David Hillman. In 1993, they both co-authored an anthology of Nova's best covers and photography titled Nova 1965‚Äì1975, along with David Gibbs.\\"Nova 1965‚Äì1975, by David Gibbs (Editor), David Hillman (Compiler), Harri Peccinotti (Photographer)\\". Pavilion Books, 1993. Peccinotti lives in Paris and continues to have his work in French Vogue, Russian Vogue, Gloss and 10 Magazine. He has received a number of awards in England and America for both art direction and photography. Style His work typically features close up shots of the female form and the face in particular and is sensual. The images are suggestive, for example, making a fetish of lips and smoking but not overtly pornographic. A notable example of his style during the 1970s are his book covers for Penguin, including a series of Iris Murdoch novels which features unusually cropped, striking pictures of women models with make up in vivid colours. More recent work includes a fashion shoot for L'Officiel magazine.\\"LA Models\\" blog, http://www.lamodelsblog.com/?q=taxonomy/term/404 Pirelli calendars He achieved particular renown for his erotic imagery for two Pirelli calendars ‚àí1968 and 1969‚Äì with designer Derek Birdsall. The 1968 calendar, shot in Tunisia, pioneered non-traditional pin-up images, which focused details such as a wisp of hair against the neck or a profile bathed in light. The imagery for the 1969 calendar was shot in California without the use of professional models. The 1968 calendar was shot during a period when, Peccinotti says, the mere hint of a nipple would prove problematic to publish. Yet 50 years on Beady Eye, Liam Gallagher's new band used a photo from the 1968 calendar for the cover of their BE album only to have it censored in supermarkets and resorting to covering the offending nipple with a sticker.

Geography The hill on which the town of Batignano stands is as pertaining between the southern foot-hills of the Monte Leoni, which arises between the homonymous area and those of Montepescali, Sticciano and Montorsaio, exceeding on the highest peak the altitude of 600 metres. History Of uncertain origins, Batignano developed in the Medieval period, around the castle which controlled the outlet of the road towards Siena on the plain of Grosseto and some lead and silver mines. It was a feud of the Aldobrandeschi and in 1213 belonged to Manto da Grosseto. In the 14th century, it then passed under the dominion of Siena, hosting many immigrants from Corsica, and so in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1738 it was reunited with the comune of Grosseto. Main sights Batignano is a characteristic suburb which conserves ruins of the town walls, with towers and gates, and a cassero, aside from a triple-arched loggiato, built with reused materials (Roman columns and capitals), probably originating from Roselle. All this gives the town a certain tone of antiquity. To emphasize is also the presence of a parish and an ancient convent, now deconsecrated, situated outside the locality.

The West Santa Ana Branch is a rail right-of-way formerly used by the Pacific Electric's (PE) Santa Ana route in Los Angeles County and Orange County in Southern California. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) owns the segment of the right-of-way in Los Angeles County, and the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) owns the segment in Orange County. The line runs from the Watts Towers in the city of Los Angeles, southeast to the intersection of 4th Street and Santa Ana Boulevard in downtown Santa Ana. A portion of it is occupied by Interstate 105 and the C Line. The right-of-way runs nearly straight for on a diagonal between the two cities, in contrast to the cardinal grid of Orange County. History The right-of-way was established as an interurban route for the Pacific Electric Railway. Service commenced in 1905, was truncated to Bellflower in 1950, and finally discontinued in 1958. Southern Pacific continued to use the line for freight. A Caltrans survey in 1981 reported that the line had been reduced to a single track railway, which had several level crossings removed and was in poor condition. The section in Orange County between Paramount and Stanton was acquired by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority in 1990 as part of the $450 million package deal with Southern Pacific. The Century Freeway and the Green Line were constructed along a segment in Lynwood, opening in 1993 and 1995 respectively. Remnants Pacific Electric Sub-Station No. 14 in Santa Ana was added to the list of National Register of Historic Places on September 22, 1983. The Ghost Town & Calico Railroad attraction at Knott's Berry Farm uses a PE depot formerly located at Hansen station along the ROW in Stanton as the main station building. The building was moved to the theme park in 1952. The Bellflower station was restored to its opening condition in 2008. Future development The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), in conjunction with Metro and OCTA, conducted an alternatives analysis to determine the list of all feasible alternatives for the project. These alternatives may use all or part of the ROW. Modes under consideration were bus rapid transit, light rail, commuter rail and high-speed rail. SCAG organized a first round of public meetings in June 2010. A second round of public meetings were held in November and December 2010. Los Angeles Metro project Metro has prioritized the corridor on its Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), and funding for it was guaranteed in the LA County Measure R and Measure M transportation funding ballot measures. As proposed, the light rail line will travel between Artesia and Union Station, using the ROW between Paramount and Artesia. OC Streetcar , the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is collaborating with the cities of Santa Ana and Garden Grove to build a streetcar line. The western terminus of the proposed route would follow the Pacific Electric right-of-way near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Westminster Avenue in Garden Grove.

Roma. He joined Fiorentina in 1965. During his first three seasons with the club he was the third-choice goalkeeper and did not play any league games in the first two. In his fourth, the 1968‚Äì69 season, Fiorentina won the Italian championship, and the impressive performances by the rookie were integral to the team's success. He played seven more seasons for Fiorentina, never equalling the brilliance of the championship season, but always proving to be a reliable shot-stopper. He remained with the team until 1976. After four seasons with Verona, Superchi later served as Roma's backup goalkeeper for four more seasons in the 1980s, and played only on one occasion, a few minutes as a substitute in the last game of the 1982‚Äì83 season, during which Roma won the Serie A title, which was the second Italian championship title of his career.

Playboy magazine names its Playmate of the Month each month throughout the year. Prior to September 1959, Playmates were not asked to complete data sheets. January Margie Harrison was an American actress and model. She was Playmate of the Month for both January 1954 and June 1954. While Marilyn Monroe preceded her as a Playboy \\"Sweetheart of the Month\\", Monroe did not appear in the center pages, but was pictured on pages 16 to 18. Harrison is therefore the first model designated \\"Playmate of the Month\\". Like Monroe, her photo was purchased from the John Baumgarth Company, which specialized in pin- up calendars. According to The Playmate Book, Harrison also appeared in the men's magazines Follies and Gala. February Marilyn Ardith Jordan (n√©e Waltz; November 5, 1931 ‚Äì December 23, 2006) was an American actress and model. Using the pseudonym, Margaret Scott, she was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the February 1954 issue. Known as Marilyn Waltz, (later Marilyn Jordan), she also appeared as Playmate of the Month in the April 1954 and April 1955 issues. She was the first of two women to become a three-time Playmate (the other being Janet Pilgrim). In her first Playboy appearance, Waltz was billed as Margaret Scott. For years thereafter, many assumed that Marilyn and Margaret were two different women. It was not until the mid-1990s that they were determined to be one and the same. Waltz was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin in 1931. In 1954, she starred in the film Love Me Madly alongside Al Molinaro. Four years later, in 1958, she married Breck Jordan. After retiring from acting and modeling, she worked in real estate in Southern California. In 1993, she moved to Oregon. She retired from real estate in 1996. March Dolores Del Monte (born March 15, 1932) was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the March 1954 issue. Del Monte was born in Spokane, Washington in 1932. Growing up, she wanted to be a model. She modeled as a pin-up, keeping the secret from her parents. In 1954, when she was nineteen, she participated in a calendar shoot. The shoot included swimsuit and nude photos. She was called and told her photo would be published, assuming it was a swimsuit photo. She was paid $50 for the shoot. It ended up being for Playboy. Just after the publishing, Del Monte got married and had children. She never knew her photos ended up in Playboy until her son saw a 25th- anniversary Playboy retrospective and called Del Monte to tell her he saw her in the magazine. Del Monte said she was embarrassed and proud at the same time when her son called with the news. In an interview with The New Yorker in 2014, Del Monte said models today \\"show too much\\" and that she would never model again. After she left modeling, Del Monte worked in public relations. April Marilyn Waltz (See February entry above) May Joanne Arnold (born April 1, 1931) was an American actress and model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the May 1954 issue. She also appeared on the covers of the March 1954 and August 1955 issues. June Margie Harrison (See January entry above) July Neva Gilbert (born September 1, 1929) was an American model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for its July 1954 issue. August Arline Hunter (born December 16, 1931) was an American actress and model. She is perhaps best known as Playboy's Playmate of the Month for August 1954. Her centerfold was the first not to be purchased from the John Baumgarth Co. by Hugh Hefner, and was photographed by Ed DeLong. September Jackie Rainbow (June 6, 1933 ‚Äì June 15, 1988) was an American model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for its September 1954 issue. Her centerfold was photographed by Carlyle Blackwell for the Publix Pictorial Service. October Madeline Castle (born December 1, 1933) was an American model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the October 1954 issue. Her centerfold was photographed by Jack Drebert and Jean Drebert. According to The Playmate Book, Castle was a prominent model in pin- ups and in men's magazines during the 1950s and early 1960s. November Diane Hunter (born July 14, 1937) was an American model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the November 1954 issue. December Terry Ryan (born December 1, 1933) was an American model. She is best known as Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for its December 1954 issue. Ryan's pictorial was the first photographed directly under Playboy's supervision. Prior to this issue, Playboy had purchased layouts from independent photographers.

Conv. (10 February 1750, Bologna - 17 May 1825, Bologna), was an Italian Conventual Franciscan friar who was a noted composer, musicologist, and music teacher of his era.Stanislao Mattei at answers.com Life Mattei was born in Bologna, then part of the Papal States, to a family of artisans. At the local Church of St. Francis, he became a pupil of the famed musician, Friar Giovanni Battista Martini, O.F.M. Conv., a member of the Franciscan community attached to the church. He also followed Martini's example and entered the Conventual Franciscans. Following his period of novitiate, he was named his mentor's assistant and substitute conductor of the famed girls choir at the church and succeeded him in that position upon his death in 1784. Mattei continued as choir director at the Church of St. Francis until 1809. He then moved briefly to Padua, where he served in that function for the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, operated by his religious Order. This situation was temporary, however as he soon returned to Bologna, where he became the music director at the Church of St. Petronius. During the occupation of Italy by the French Revolutionary Army, the friary was suppressed and the community of friars scattered. Mattei then went to live with his mother, supporting himself by giving private instruction. Music Mattei's music bears a close resemblance to the style of composition of Martini, his mentor. Mattei himself composed over 300 works of sacred music, a body of work which remains largely unpublished. He also composed some secular vocal pieces and symphonies. In 1804 he was appointed as a professor at the Liceo Musicale di Bologna (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini), where he had among his pupils Gaetano Donizetti, Yevstigney Fomin, Angelo Mariani, Francesco Morlacchi, Luigi Felice Rossi, Gioachino Rossini, Giovanni Tadolini, and Christian Theodor Weinlig.

He batted and threw right-handed. Mashore played football, basketball, track and baseball at Clayton Valley High School in Concord, California, graduating in 1964. He was signed by the Reds prior to the 1964 season as an amateur free agent. He was then drafted by the New York Mets in the Rule 5 draft, but was returned to the Reds the following spring. He made his major league debut over a year later on July 11, 1969 at age 24. In his first major league at bat (and only one of the season) against the Houston Astros at the Astrodome, he pinch-hit for pitcher Camilo Pascual against pitcher Don Wilson and flied out to right field in a 13-2 Reds loss. During the 1970 season he was traded to the Expos for Ty Cline. His first career hit, RBI and run scored all came on one swing of the bat on September 14, 1970 against the New York Mets at Montreal's Jarry Park. Starting at centerfield and batting seventh, he slugged a two-run homer off Ray Sadecki in the second inning. In four seasons with Montreal, he played in 239 games, including a personal-best 93 in 1972. He ended his major league career with eight home runs and 47 runs batted in with 87 hits and a .208 batting average.

The blog predominantly discusses climate issues with a focus on anthropogenic climate change, generally accommodating beliefs that are in opposition to the scientific consensus on climate change. Contributors include Christopher Monckton and Fred Singer as guest authors. In November 2009, the blog was one of the first websites to publish emails and documents from the Climatic Research Unit controversy, and a driving force behind its coverage. In the early months of 2010, it was reported the site might be \\"the most read climate blog in the world,\\" and in 2013 Michael E. Mann referred to it as the leading climate change denial blog. Content Watts Up With That features material disputing the scientific consensus on climate change, including claims the human role in global warming is insignificant and carbon dioxide is not a driving force of warming.: \\"Despite the well-known facts under discussion, the original graph, based on a single outdated study published in 1991, continues to reappear again and again in climate skeptical media, trying to prove that the sun, not anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is causing global warming. The original curve appears, for example, on Anthony Watts' climate skeptical blog \\"Watts Up With That?\\" in an article posted in 2011.\\" It hosts several contributors, such as Christopher Monckton and Fred Singer, in addition to Watts. It is among the most prominent climate change denial blogs,: \\"One of the highest trafficked climate blogs is wattsupwiththat.com, a website that publishes climate misinformation on a daily basis.\\": \\"More importantly, it was becoming clear that the most effective denialist media weapon was not the newspapers or television but the internet. A number of influential websites, like Watts Up With That?, Climate Skeptic and Climate Depot, were established.\\": \\"The most authoritative climate change skepticism web sites included Watts Up With That? and Climate Depot\\" and is described by climatologist Michael E. Mann as the most popular, having surpassed Climate Audit.: \\"Since then, a number of other amateur climate change denial bloggers have arrived on the scene. Most prominent among them is Anthony Watts, a meteorologist...and founder of the site \\"Watts Up with That?\\" which has overtaken climate audit as the leading climate change denial blog.\\" Columbia Journalism School writer Curtis Brainard has written that \\"scientists have repeatedly criticized [Watts] for misleading readers on subjects such as the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record.\\": \\"At the other end of the spectrum are influential sites for \\"climate skeptics\\", such as Watts Up With That?, a blog run by meteorologist Anthony Watts, whom scientists have repeatedly criticized for misleading readers on subjects such as the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record.\\" Temperature records In 2007 WUWT readers alerted Stephen McIntyre to a discrepancy in temperature records published by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) based on data from United States Historical Climate Network. In August 2007, McIntyre notified GISS about the problematic numbers, which GISS acknowledged and promptly corrected. The change did not affect global temperature trends, but did have the marginal effect of changing the hottest year on record for the contiguous United States to 1934, rather than 1998 as had previously been shown. In a formal acknowledgement, GISS stated that the minor data processing error had only affected the years after 2000, and noted that the contiguous United States represents only 1.6% of the Earth's surface. The result was a statistical tie between the years 1934, 1998 and 2005 as the warmest years to date for these U.S. states, with 1934 warmest by only around 0.01 ¬∞C which was well within the margin of uncertainty. Involvement in the Climatic Research Unit email controversy In 2009, Watts Up With That was involved in popularizing the Climatic Research Unit email controversy,: \\"Watts is best known for his very heavily trafficked blog Watts Up With That?, began in 2006, which provides not just a megaphone for himself but a rallying ground for other AGW deniers, notably Christopher Monckton. The blog played an important role in the Climategate fiasco, through its dissemination of the hacked CRU emails.\\": \\"In 2009, an unknown party acquired a large cache of private emails between climate scientists...and published them online. Cherry-picking quotes in order to make the scientists appear as though they were discussing data manipulation, bloggers such as Watts whipped up a pseudo-scandal that reverberated for years despite the fact that a series of nine investigations in the U.S. and the U.K. cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. wherein emails of several climatologists were published by a hacker. The story was initially broken on WUWT and two other blogs when the hacker posted a link to a Russian server containing emails and documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, and subsequently reproduced on the WUWT blog. Because of WUWT's high traffic count, this was the catalyst which broke the story to the media.Fred Pearce, \\"Search for hacker may lead police back to East Anglia's climate research unit\\", The Guardian, 9 February 2010. The term \\"Climategate\\" was originally coined by a commenter in a post on WUWT. Watts argued that the emails showed the scientists were manipulating data, and while a series of independent investigations cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing,The eight major investigations covered by secondary sources include: House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (UK); Independent Climate Change Review (UK); International Science Assessment Panel (UK); Pennsylvania State University first panel and second panel (US); United States Environmental Protection Agency (US); Department of Commerce (US); National Science Foundation (US) public accusations resulting from the event continued for years. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged throughout the investigations,Lubchenco, Jane (2 December 2009) House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (House Select Committee). \\"The Administration's View on the State of Climate Science\\". House Hearing, 111 Congress. U.S. Government Printing Office. \\"...the e-mails really do nothing to undermine the very strong scientific consensus and the independent scientific analyses of thousands of scientists around the world that tell us that the Earth is warming and that the warming is largely a result of human activities.\\" As quoted in the report published by Office of Inspector General. however, the reports may have decreased public confidence in climate scientists and the IPCC, and conclusively altered the Copenhagen negotiations that year.: \\"Climategate fundamentally damaged confidence in the IPCC climate reports and decisively changed the conditions for the Copenhagen negotiations...Climategate and the failure of Copenhagen coincided with a widespread decline in public acceptance that global warming was happening, was caused by humans, and was a serious threat...Climategate can also explain the erosion of public trust in scientists as sources of information on global warming after 2010.\\": \\"Having this powerful, pervasive and multifaceted media apparatus at its service provides the denial machine with a highly effective means of spreading its message, as reflected quite recently by its success in turning a tiny and highly unrepresentative sample of thirteen years worth of personal e-mails hacked from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia into a major scandal that has generated a decline in public belief in climate change and trust in climate scientists...despite the fact that several investigations have concluded that the e-mails neither demonstrate unethical behavior nor undermine climate science.\\" In a 2010 interview with the Financial Times, Watts said that his blog had become \\"busier than ever\\" after the incident and that traffic to the site had tripled. Reception According to Alexa internet statistical analysis, What's Up With That? is ranked No. 14,882 in the U.S. and No. 40,090 world-wide. It is reported to receive between half a million and 2 million visits per month between 2010 and 2014.: \\"Watts Up With That was created in 2006 by Californian meteorologist Anthony Watts...From its modest beginnings, Pearce suggests it is now \\"perhaps the most visited climate website in the world...with more than two million unique visitors a month\\": \\"Anthony Watts is an extremely popular blogger, drawing hundreds of comments per post and well over half a million visitors per month. Yet his blog contains highly questionable information-presented very \\"scientifically\\" of course, replete with charts and graphs-but all directed toward the end of making the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming seem faulty (in fact, it's extremely robust) It was described by climatologist Michael E. Mann in The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars as \\"the leading climate change denial blog,\\" having surpassed Climate Audit in popularity. Watts's blog has been criticized for inaccuracy. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot described WUWT as \\"highly partisan and untrustworthy\\". Leo Hickman, at The Guardian's Environment Blog, also criticized Watts's blog, stating that Watts \\"risks polluting his legitimate scepticism about the scientific processes and methodologies underpinning climate science with his accompanying politicised commentary.\\" Between 2008 and 2013, WUWT asked its readers to vote in several internet voting-based awards, and it won \\"best science blog\\" and \\"best blog\\" from the Bloggies: \\"With just days to go until voting closed, the 2008 weblog awards - an annual online popularity contest in which nearly 1 million voters pick their favorite opiners across forty-eight topic categories-featured a tight race for Best Science Blog...In the end, Watts Up With That defeated Pharyngula by a vote of 14,150 votes to 12,238.\\" and the conservative Wizbang Weblog Awards. In 2013, Leo Hickman wrote in The Guardian Environment Blog that 13 of the 17 blogs nominated for the Science or Technology category for the Bloggies \\"were either run by climate sceptics, or popular with climate sceptics\\". The Bloggies founder acknowledged in 2013 that \\"climate sceptic\\" bloggers had influenced voting. He said \\"Unfortunately, I have no good solution for it, since they follow proper voting procedures and legitimate science blogs don't want to make an effort to compete.\\" He discontinued the science category in 2014. WUWT did not win \\"Best Topical Weblog of the Year\\" 2014 as Watts claimed, but did enter the Hall of Fame that year.

Her writing has appeared in publications including Quillette, TIME, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, National Review, First Things, The Weekly Standard, and other venues. In March 2017, she was named senior research fellow at the Faith & Reason Institute. Eberstadt spoke at the Edmund Burke Foundation's inaugural National Conservatism Conference in July, 2019.  Education and personal life  Eberstadt grew up in rural upstate New York. She graduated magna cum laude in 1983 from Cornell University, where she was a four-year Telluride Scholar. Eberstadt is married to author and demographer Nicholas Eberstadt.  Professional career  Eberstadt has written for a wide variety of magazines and newspapers. New York Times columnist David Brooks has twice awarded Eberstadt's writing a \\"Sidney,\\" his annual award for best essay writing of the year. Columnist George Will has called Eberstadt \\"intimidatingly intelligent,\\" and author George Weigel has called her \\"our premier analyst of American cultural foibles and follies, with a keen eye for oddities that illuminate just how strange the country's moral culture has become.\\" In 2016, HarperCollins published Eberstadt's latest book, It's Dangerous to Believe: Religious Freedom and Its Enemies, which chronicles the rise in discrimination against religious believers in the United States and elsewhere during an era of ascendant secularism. The book argues that the sexual revolution has inadvertently generated a new, rival, secularist Western faith, complete with quasi-religious ritual and theology; and that this new secularist faith must learn to coexist in civility alongside traditional Judeo-Christianity, rather than seeking to drive other men and women of faith from the public square. Thomas Farr of the Religious Freedom Project said that \\"every man and woman of the left should read this book.\\" Robert P. George called it \\"a powerful manifesto.\\" Russell D. Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention said that \\"this book will equip you to know what's happening to America's first freedom and will inspire you to act.\\" In its review of the book, Publishers Weekly noted the one-sided nature of her arguments: \\"Casting believers almost entirely as innocent victims without any political or cultural power causes the work to lose some nuance, as does her assertion that Western secularism places Islam off limits for critique. For traditional Christians, Eberstadt provides a language to defend their position, a comforting sense that their persecution is real, and a view of the irony of progressives curtailing freedom....[T]he final chapter's call to attend to rhetoric and avoid generalization powerfully makes the case for more civility in the midst of intense disagreement.\\" Writing in the Weekly Standard, Jonathan Last called the book \\"brilliant\\" and a \\"tour de force, essential reading for anyone wondering how our civilization can survive the current moment.\\" Eberstadt is the author of several other books, including How the West Really Lost God, published in 2013. How the West Really Lost God, fortified with an intensive study of both historical data and contemporary popular culture, proffers the original thesis that the undermining of the family in Western culture has in turn helped power religious decline. Francis Fukuyama wrote of the book, \\"Mary Eberstadt is one of the most acute and creative social observers of our time. She is not afraid to challenge received wisdom and her insights are always well worth pondering.\\" Rodney Stark called the book \\"A brilliant contribution to the really big question about the future of the West, and a pleasure to read.\\" The review in The Economist said that the \\"elegantly written book repeatedly shows that strong families help to keep religious practice alive, and that too many people see a causal connection running exclusively in the opposite direction.\\" Writing in The American Conservative, Rod Dreher called the book \\"stunning,\\" adding that \\"Eberstadt's contribution is to make an argument that not only does religion cause family formation, but family formation causes religion.\\" Eberstadt is known for her writings on animal welfare, and the moral connections she draws between the pro-life and pro- animal movements. Her widely discussed 2009 essay in First Things, \\"Pro- Animal, Pro-Life,\\" was followed by a number of other, related pieces on the subject, among them \\"The Truth About Religion and Animals,\\" \\"Support for Animal Welfare Grows on the Right,\\" and \\"Why Animal Lovers Should Abhor Planned Parenthood.\\" Eberstadt also authored Adam and Eve After the Pill: Paradoxes of the Sexual Revolution, published in 2012. The book examines how the sexual revolution has produced widespread discontent among men and women, and has harmed the weakest members of society. Eberstadt explores the portrayal of the sexual revolution in pop culture voices, pinpointing \\"a wildly contradictory mix of chatter about how wonderful it is that women are now all liberated for sexual fun--and how mysteriously impossible it has become to find a good, steady, committed boyfriend at the same time.\\" A review in the Washington Times stated that \\"in this concise, elegantly written book, Eberstadt marries brilliant analytical power with wry wit\\" and called it \\"an enormous contribution to understanding both modern moral culture and the significance of current political debate.\\" Eberstadt's first book, Home-Alone America: The Hidden Toll of Day Care, Behavioral Drugs and Other Parent Substitutes, argued that separating children from family members at early ages is linked to childhood problems such as obesity and rising rates of mental and behavioral disorders. The book also connected these problems to popular culture, particularly as reflected in adolescent music (including the award- winning chapter, \\"Eminem is Right\\"). R. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, called it \\"a book that should be read by every concerned parent, pastor, and policy maker.\\" Eberstadt served as a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution from 2002 to 2013. From 1990 to 1998, Eberstadt was executive editor of National Interest magazine. From 1985 and 1987, she was a member of the Policy Planning Staff at the US State Department and a speechwriter for then Secretary of State George P. Shultz. From 1984 to 1985, she was a special assistant to Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. Eberstadt was also a managing editor of the Public Interest. Eberstadt is also the founder of the Kirkpatrick Society, named after her late mentor, Jeane Kirkpatrick. Founded in 2011, the Kirkpatrick Society is based in Washington, D.C. and is a professional and literary society for women working in journalism, government, television, radio, book editing, think tanks, and foundations. The Kirkpatrick Society is made up of over 300 women and meets on a monthly basis. As of January 2017, the American Enterprise Institute assumed responsibility for the management and operations of the Kirkpatrick Society. On March 15, 2017, Eberstadt became a senior research fellow at the Faith & Reason Institute.  The Loser Letters  Eberstadt published her first work of fiction in 2010, The Loser Letters: A Comic Tale of Life, Death, and Atheism. The book satirically follows the experiences of a young Christian converting to atheism. P. J. O'Rourke wrote that \\"Mary Eberstadt is the rightful heir and assign√©e of CS Lewis, and her heroine in The Loser Letters is the legitimate child (or perhaps grandchild) of 'the patient' in The Screwtape Letters.\\" Playwright and director Jeffrey Fiske adapted the book for the stage, which had its world premiere at The Catholic University of America in September 2016 starring World Champion and Olympic Gymnast Chellsie Memmel. According to Kathryn Jean Lopez of National Review, \\"The timing of this adaptation by playwright Jeffrey Fiske may just be an opportunity to catch millennial \\"nones\\" with an invitation. It's also a nudge to conservatives and others to get creative. Polemics alone won't change the world.\\" Writing also for National Review, Stanley Kurtz noted that this play could serve as a test of free speech on other college campuses. \\"What if The Loser Letters were to go on a tour that included some secular colleges?,\\" he asked. \\"I'd like to believe the play would be courteously received at any school, but I can't help feeling that heads might explode‚Äîwith protests or worse to follow. I only hope we get a chance to find out.\\"  Recognition  In 2014, Eberstadt gave Seton Hall University's commencement address and was awarded an honorary degree. The choice of Eberstadt as the school's commencement speaker brought dissent from some faculty members, who objected that her values were not consistent with those of the university. USA Today listed Eberstadt's address in its compilation of notable 2014 commencement speeches, alongside the speeches of John Kerry, John Legend, and Eric Holder. In 2014, the Siena Symposium for Women, Family, and Culture at St. Thomas University in Minnesota awarded Eberstadt a Humanitarian Leadership Award. She also received a Leadership Award from the Catholic Lawyers' Guild of Nebraska that same year. In 2009, Mt. St. Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland awarded its Presidential Medal of Honor to Eberstadt and her husband, Nicholas.

This is Fiennes' directorial debut. It also stars Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius, Vanessa Redgrave as Volumnia, and Brian Cox as Menenius. Although the film is not explicit about its contemporary Eastern European setting, a title card states the film is set in \\"A Place Calling Itself Rome\\". It was filmed in Serbia, Montenegro, and the UK.  Plot  In Rome, riots are in progress after stores of grain are withheld from citizens and civil liberties are reduced due to a war between Rome and neighbouring Volsci. The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes), a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the city's problems. During a march, the rioters encounter Martius, who is openly contemptuous and does not hide his low opinion of the regular citizens. The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of Corioles and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight. Martius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius (John Kani) gives him the agnomen of \\"Coriolanus\\". Coriolanus's mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) encourages her son to run for consul within the Roman Senate. Coriolanus is reluctant but he eventually agrees to his mother's wishes. He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two tribunes, Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a traitor, Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the plebeians in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing \\"crows to peck the eagles\\". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: \\"There is a world elsewhere\\". After being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Voscilian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator Menenius (Brian Cox) follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and his son. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome and Coriolanus makes peace between the Volscians and the Romans alongside General Cominius. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian border, he is confronted by Aufidius and his men, who now also brand him as a traitor. They call him Martius and refuse to call him by his \\"stolen name\\" of Coriolanus. Aufidius explains to Coriolanus how he put aside his hatred so that they could conquer Rome but now that Coriolanus has prevented this, he has betrayed the promise between them. For this betrayal, Aufidius and his men attack and kill Coriolanus.

It currently holds an approval rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 7.38/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Visceral and visually striking, Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus proves Shakespeare can still be both electrifying and relevant in a modern context.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Katherine Monk of The Vancouver Sun gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Coriolanus not only finds all the contemporary parallels, it reiterates the tragedy of the endlessly exploited patriot who hopes to earn love at the end of a barrel\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote in her review, \\"Mr. Fiennes has made smart choices here, notably by surrounding himself with a strong secondary cast\\".  Accolades  The film was nominated for Golden Berlin Bear award at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.

Outlook Outlook was the company's first publication. It was a bi-weekly newspaper and followed a newspaper approach in layout based in strong journalism and professional design, rather than serving as a promotional publication for the Greater Columbus LGBT community. Circulation was between 8,000 and 12,000 and distributed to over 200 locations. Outlook Weekly Outlook Weekly replaced Outlook as the companies primary publication. Published every week rather than every other week, the newspaper had similar content and format. In 2004, the publication switched content slightly, from just a news tabloid to a lifestyle tabloid as well. History Outlook Publishing, Inc. was founded by co-owners and publishers Jeffrey D. Cox and Jim Ryan in the spring of 1995 with the primary purpose of publishing their paper titled Outlook. Ryan was editor and managed distribution while Cox managed finances, layout, and design from his home. The paper relied on volunteer initiative and freelance reporters to operate. Before Outlook's establishment, the only other GLBT focused publications in Ohio were the Gay People's Chronicle, which was based out of Cleveland, and a monthly publication from Stonewall Columbus. Outlook was created to fill the void as a news voice for the Columbus community. Under Cox, and Ryan's ownership, the newspaper quickly became respected as a professional news source. In the fall of 1998, Outlook earned five writing awards, called the Vice Versa Awards for Excellence in the Gay and Lesbian Press, from the National Gay and Lesbian Journalists Association and received third place for Best Newspaper in the weekly or bi-weekly category. These awards were given for the paper's approach to controversial topics and the effect they had on the Columbus community. For example, when Outlook published a piece about anti-gay harassment by members of the Ohio State University wrestling team, the OSU Athletic Department created mandatory sexual orientation cultural competence training for all its employees. In early 1999, Outlook Publishing, Inc. was sold to Lynn Greer, Jose Rodriguez, and Malcolm Riggle operating from Riggle's offices in Worthington, Ohio. Within the year Rodriguez sold his share of the company to Greer and Riggle. In the fall of 2003, Malcom Riggle assumed sole-ownership of company operations. Under his leadership, Outlook Weekly became a lifestyle tabloid. That November, Outlook Publishing, Inc. changed names to Outlook Media, Inc.

OHP can be used to treat all types of organic wastewaters to achieve chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, or increase biodegradability. It can be applied as the standalone treatment or combined with a more economical biological treatment, depending on the oxidant's dose. This technology is based on Fenton's reaction (Fenton's reagent). It consists in the oxidation of organic matter using hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide by ferrous ions. The OHP reaction is carried out in the acidic medium and mild condition of temperature (100-150 degrees Celsius) and pressure (2-4 bar) in a safe and efficient way, using optimized catalyst and hydrogen peroxide formulations. Combination of mild temperatures (higher than conventional Fenton's reaction but still lower than other oxidative techniques) together permits to cover the gap between wastewater technologies to treat the effluents with moderate to high refractory organic matter content and low biodegradability. There are some types of wastewater where conventional treatment methods (biological, physical-chemical) are not efficient enough and on the other hand severe conditions oxidative methods (incineration, high pressure/temperature oxidation systems) are not economically attractive. The use of a strong oxidant and higher temperatures and pressures as in OHP significantly improves the grade of mineralisation of most organic compounds with small residence times and more efficient usage of hydrogen peroxide. For these effluents OHP process can be an alternative or a complementary treatment. However, complete mineralisation may not be necessary to increase biodegradability to acceptable levels. The future of Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) techniques lies in its use as pre-treatment followed by biological treatment Category:Sewerage ","title":"Humid oxidation with peroxide"},{"id":"26505424","text":"Bumble and bumble Products, LLC is one of 27 brands owned by Est√©e Lauder Companies, Inc.

Biography Mendive was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1944. His family practiced La Regla de Ocha, or Santer√≠a. A mulatto, he cherishes his Yoruba roots from the West coast of Africa. In 1963, he graduated from the San Alejandro Academy of Plastic Arts, Havana. Awards He has received numerous awards for his art within exhibitions in Cuba and in Europe. Since the beginning of his artistic career, he has participated in many group and solo art exhibits. His first one-man show was held at the Center of Art in Havana, in 1964.O'Neill, Rosemary. \\"Biographies,\\" Art in Latin America, Dawn Ades. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1989: 350. In 1968, he was awarded with the Adam Montparnasse prize for his painting exhibit at the Salon de Mai, in Paris, and third prize at the Sal√≥n Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, in Havana. Additional noteworthy awards Mendive has received include the Alejo Carpentier Medal from the Consejo de Estado of the Republic of Cuba, in 1988, and the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Minister of Culture and Francophony of the French Republic, in 1994.Block, Holly. \\"Biographies,\\" Art Cuba: The New Generation. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. Publishers, 2001: 155. Today, his art resides in museums and galleries all over the world which include Cuba, Russia, Somalia, Benin, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Jamaica, and the United States. Style and subject Mendive's work incorporates several art mediums and genres. His art consists of drawing, painting, body painting, wood carving, sculpture, and performance that integrates loosely choreographed dance with rhythmic music. At times, the availability of art materials was rather scarce due to the harsh economic climate of the island. As a result, he relied on his creativity and resourcefulness to obtain various mediums, commonly found in nature. Much of his work consists of paint and wood, which he combines with other interesting elements, such as, human hair, sand, feathers, and glass that convey a primitive quality.Block, H., \\"Biographies,\\" 155. He not only paints with oils and pastels on canvases, but he paints on masks and posters. Mendive is also famous for his representation of saints and Lukumi gods through his use of carved, burned, and painted wood that he made during the 1960s.O'Neill, R., \\"Biographies,\\" 350. Mendive's art is strongly influenced by the Santer√≠a religion. In fact, Santer√≠a permeates every form of his art from body painting to events performed in public spaces.Craven, David. \\"Part Two,\\" Art and Revolution in Latin America 1910-1990. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2002: 110. In the 1960s and 1970s, his most significant works were created, and they depict a primitive display of Yoruba mythology with his use of raw materials that resemble altars. A prime example that his style is primitive and mythological is reflected in his art piece \\"Voodoo Altar\\" displayed at the Museo Nacional de Guanabacoa, in Cuba. Some of the materials Mendive's used to create \\"Voodoo Altar\\" include twigs, feathers, and hair. According to the Cuban art critique Gerardo Mosquera, his art does not contain ceremonial function, but possesses a sense of 'living mythological thought' and utilizes Afro-Cuban imagery to study the questions of contemporary life.Poupeye, Veerle. \\"Chapter 3,\\" Caribbean Art. New York: Thames and Hudson Inc., 1998: 100. His mythological and religious themes are evident in his 1967 painting \\"Oya\\", which is the Yoruba goddess of storms. Oya is associated with the passage from life into death and Mendive had a fascination with death during his 'dark period' in the late 1960s.Poupeye, V., \\"Chapter 3,\\" 100. An example of his primitive, Afro-Cuban imagery is seen in his 1976 painted wood carving, \\"Slave Ship\\", which epitomizes the onset of the struggles in modern-day life. His art is minimalistic, yet it is thought provoking. In the 1970s, he continued to promote Afro-Cuban culture through his colorful art by referencing the Middle Passage, colonialism, Cuban history, and Yoruba history.Bettelheim, Judith. \\"Chapter 1,\\" Afrocuba: Works on Paper, 1968-2003. San Francisco University: University of Washington Press, 2005: 30. His art is a mixture of African and European styles. He uses this culmination of African and European techniques and traditions to showcase his Afro-Cuban style to the Western world. Mendive displays a narration in much of his art and performances. This is evident in his 1968 painting of Che Guevara, which offers a visual narrative to the Western world about Che Guevara's positive influence in Cuba. Gerardo Mosquera meditatively remarks on Mendive's art, \\"the black person tends to be integrated with few contradictions into a new entity: the Cuban nation.\\" Craven, D., \\"Part Two,\\" 110. Mendive is successful at producing art that combines Afro-Cuban culture with international themes to make an ideological statement about social issues in Cuba. In addition, his art illustrates the influences that came from Africa and Europe in Cuba. From the mid-1960s to 2010, much of his work includes paintings and drawings that portray spirits and Orisha saints through the use of a wide array of colors and smooth, flowing shapes. The primary theme in his art is his recognition that African religion and African culture have shaped Cuban national identity and culture. Gerardo Mosquera praises him for his art because Mendive acknowledges the rich tapestry of African contributions to the Cuban culture. Mendive recently exhibited at the N'Namdi Center for Contemporary Art in Detroit.Mary Lendzion, \\"Best of the rest: More fun things to do May 15-21\\", Detroit Free Press, May 15, 2014. Trip to Africa In 1982, Mendive made his first trip to West Africa and traveled throughout the region for a year gaining new insight into his Yoruba roots.Bettelheim, J., \\"Chapter 1,\\" 30. He drew energy from spending time in Africa and became inspired on a whole new level. After his return to Cuba, his art portrayed images connected with the natural environment, such as, his 1984 painting \\"Viento a Fete\\". Mendive's work was exhibited at the \\"Ouidah '92\\" festival, which celebrated Vodun art from Benin and the African Diaspora in Ouidah, Benin in February 1993. An example of his belief that African religion and culture are linked with the natural world is captured through his 1997 painting \\"Olofi, the Spirits, Man and Nature\\". In addition, his performances exemplify his heightened passion of the African culture. His interest in the culture was made apparent in his 1986 performance \\"La vida\\", in which he painted the bodies and faces of the dancers with flowing lines that symbolize spirits.

Playboy magazine names its Playmate of the Month each month throughout the year. January Bettie Page (April 22, 1923 ‚Äì December 11, 2008) was an American model who became famous in the 1950s for her fetish modeling and pin-up photos. She has often been called the \\"Queen of pinups\\". Her look, including her jet black hair and trademark bangs, has influenced many artists. She was also one of the earliest Playmates of the Month for Playboy magazine. February Jayne Mansfield (April 19, 1933 ‚Äì June 29, 1967) was an American actress working both on Broadway and in Hollywood. One of the leading blonde sex symbols of the 1950s, Mansfield starred in several popular Hollywood films that emphasized her platinum-blonde hair, hourglass figure and cleavage- revealing costumes. Mansfield had been a Playboy Playmate of the Month and appeared in the magazine several additional times. She died in an automobile accident at age 34. March No issue was published for March 1955. April Marilyn Ardith Waltz (November 5, 1931 ‚Äì December 23, 2006) was an American actress and model. She was Playboys Playmate of the Month in the February 1954, April 1954, and April 1955 issues. She was the first of two women to become a three-time Playmate (the other being Janet Pilgrim). In her first Playboy appearance, Waltz was billed as Margaret Scott. For years thereafter, many assumed that Marilyn and Margaret were two different women. It was not until the mid-1990s that they were determined to be one and the same. May Marguerite Empey (July 29, 1932 ‚Äì August 19, 2008) was an American model, dancer and actress. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month in May 1955 and in February 1956. The photos for her 1956 appearance were taken by soft core porn director Russ Meyer. June Eve Meyer (December 13, 1928 ‚Äì March 27, 1977) was an American pin-up model, motion picture actress, and later, film producer. Much of her work was done in conjunction with sexploitation filmmaker Russ Meyer to whom she was married from April 2, 1952 until 1969. Eve perished in the Tenerife airport disaster on board Pan Am Flight 1736. July Janet Pilgrim (June 13, 1934 ‚Äì May 1, 2017) was an American model and office worker for Playboy. She was chosen as Playboy's Playmate of the Month three times: July 1955, December 1955 and October 1956. August Pat Lawler (born December 29, 1929) is an American model.

Biography Following a short basic training, he obtained a grant to study art in Paris, from the autumn of 1902. He started as a student of Jean-Paul Laurens at the Acad√©mie Julian, as did numerous several modern-minded Hungarian painters after him, but a few months later, ostensibly for financial reasons, he transferred to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. There Fernand Cormon was his teacher. With classmates they often went to Ambroise Vollard‚Äôs art dealership together, where M√°rffy was most impressed by the pictures of Paul C√©zanne, Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Rouault and Georges Braque. He claims to have met Matisse in 1905, who had been sent down from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, but would return there from time to time, and to have visited him in his studio once. M√°rffy's time in Paris was crucial for his artistic development and later career, not only because he gained familiarity with French painters and students, but also of his connections with other Hungarian artists: B√©la Cz√≥bel, R√≥bert Ber√©ny and Bertalan P√≥r, later members of the Eight (Nyolcak) with him. In addition, he met the philosopher of art Lajos F√ºlep, the writer and critic Gy√∂rgy B√∂l√∂ni, who wrote about the new art, and the poet Endre Ady, all of whom later also returned to Budapest. In 1906, the last year of his stay in France, M√°rffy exhibited with fauvists at the Salon d'Automne of Paris. Back in Budapest, in March 1907, M√°rffy exhibited the works he made in France in the Ur√°nia art dealership, in the company of Lajos Gul√°csy, at a show that received very good reviews. The success of this exhibition brought him the friendship of J√≥zsef Rippl-R√≥nai and K√°roly Kernstok. Rippl-R√≥nai, who had lived in France and was one of the Nabis, invited the young painter to Kaposv√°r. Due to his support, M√°rffy became a founding member of MI√âNK (Magyar Impresszionist√°k √©s Naturalist√°k K√∂re ‚Äì Circle of Hungarian Impressionists and Naturalists). K√°roly Kernstok, a well-established painter who led The Eight, invited Marffy to his inherited property in Nyerges√∫jfalu. There M√°rffy worked at art, exploring fauvism. From late 1909, M√°rffy actively participated with the group of artists who seceded from the MI√âNK, and were to become famous as The Eight (A Nyolcak). Other members were R√≥bert Ber√©ny, Dezs≈ë Czig√°ny, B√©la Cz√≥bel, K√°roly Kernstok, Dezs≈ë Orb√°n, Bertalan P√≥r and Lajos Tihanyi. They had their first exhibit together in 1909. In 1911 they held their first exhibit under the name of The Eight. Their first exhibit opened on 30 December 1909, at the K√∂nyves K√°lm√°n Salon (Budapest), under the title New Pictures. Their second exhibition ‚Äì already entitled The Eight ‚Äì opened in April 1911 in the National Salon. While the Eight as a group had only three exhibitions in total, they were involved in all the new intellectual movements, and were part of evenings with new Hungarian literature and contemporary music. Contributors included many writers associated with the journal Nyugat (Endre Ady (d. 1919), Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi), and the music was by the most modern composers: for instance, B√©la Bart√≥k and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. Between 1909 and 1914, M√°rffy's painting was constantly transforming. The exalted, fauvist brushwork gave way, in his landscapes, nudes, still lifes and portraits, to an increasingly rigorous mode of composition. The disciplined, constructivist approach would be loosened up in the second half of the decade by increasingly expressionistic solutions, thanks in part to his encounter with Oskar Kokoschka. Marriage and family In August 1920, √ñd√∂n M√°rffy married the young widow Berta (Boncza) Ady, also known as \\"Csinszka.\\" Her husband Endre Ady had died in 1919, after they had been married four years. The marriage brought emotional and financial security to M√°rffy. Success By the 1920s, M√°rffy had become an acknowledged, much sought-after painter, who exhibited regularly. He could afford to travel and often went to paint in Germany and Italy, where he also took part regularly at the Venice Biennials. He exhibited internationally, including in the United States, Italy, Poland, Vienna, and Nuremberg and Munich in Germany. The only member of the Eight to work regularly in Hungary, he had considerable authority in the local scene. Most of the other artists had emigrated after the fall of the Hungarian Democratic Republic in 1919. Orb√°n emigrated in 1939, with the rise in anti-Semitism and invasion of Poland. In 1924 M√°rffy became a founding member of the KUT (New Society of Visual Artists), an umbrella of modern endeavours. In 1927 √ñd√∂n M√°rffy was elected to the head of the organization, serving for a decade. Meanwhile, his style grew softer, more accessible, as well as airier and more decorative. His canvases long retained the fauvist colours and remnants of the constructivist space structures, and he would return to his earlier vision for the sake of the odd picture or two. By the end of the 1920s, he replaced the vibrant colours with a scumbled, misty, more relaxed atmosphere, and the style became smoother, more decorative, more palatable for a middle-class audience. The landscapes, garden and seaside scenes, nudes and still lifes he painted between the wars resemble the approach of the √âcole de Paris painters, especially of Mo√Øse Kisling, Jules Pascin, Van Dongen and Raoul Dufy. After the Second World War, M√°rffy was among the first to join the European School, founded on 13 October 1945. His painterly style, even his views on art, were distant from the approach of the School's younger painters. They were attracted partly to the Surrealists and partly to the abstract artists; in many ways they were connected to the art of Corneille and the Cobra group. √ñd√∂n M√°rffy died in the K√∫tv√∂lgyi Hospital on 3 December 1959, three days after his 81st birthday.

Gasteria armstrongii - Information page Description This slow-growing species is closely related to the similar, but much larger, Gasteria nitida species of the South African grasslands, and their bright reddish-pink flowers are very similar. (In some classification schemes, it is even classed as a variety within this species, and in cultivation G. armstrongii can resemble juvenile plants of G. nitida.) For those who treat it as a separate species, Gasteria armstrongii can be distinguished by its very dark, retuse, distichous, roughly tuberculate leaves. Its inflorescences are also solitary. (G. nitida is much larger, with smooth leaves that grow in a rosette, not distichous. Its inflorescences are branched.) Taxonomy Gasteria armstrongii was first described by Selmar Sch√∂nland in 1912. It was reduced to the variety armstrongii of Gasteria nitida by Ernst van Jaarsveld in 1992, a status accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Distribution Distribution map This species occurs in only a few spots in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Here is occurs along the Gamtoos river, in a vegetation type named \\"Humansdorp Shale Renosterveld\\". At the edge of its habitat it gradually transforms into Gasteria nitida, making the two species part of a continuum. The habitat of G. armstrongii is a flat to hilly terrain rich in pebbles, among which G. armstrongii is difficult to detect. The plants grow in full sun or are partially covered by small shrubs. The rainfall in its habitat occurs all year round, but marginally more in summer. This is the most threatened of all the Gasteria species, as its habitat is rapidly being developed.

Career He played for 10 seasons (227 games, 4 goals) in the Serie A for A.C. Milan, F.C. Catanzaro and A.S. Roma. He is most famous for the Turone's goal. The goal he scored in a crucial league game against league-leading Juventus F.C. for second-placed A.S. Roma was disallowed as the linesman ruled he was offside. The game ended 0‚Äì0 and Juventus eventually clinched the title. The TV images never clarified, in a definitive way, if the player's position was irregular or not. In the following years, it continued to come in succession conflicting opinions, projections with new technologies and accusations of manipulation of slow motion; in any case, from then on, the so- called Turone's goal remained a hot topic in Italian football for decades to come.

The SRP consists of several different examinations, evaluations, and interviews. These sections are broken into two areas, administrative and medical, and, when combined, may take as few as two hours or as long as eight hours, depending on the information and advanced specialized testing that an individual soldier may require: *The administrative section of the SRP encompasses the least amount of time spent in the SRP process. A soldier may typically complete these stations in as little as 25 minutes or as long as two hours. The soldier will visit several stations during the administrative portion of the SRP, including legal, chaplain, life insurance, family situation changes, and security clearances. During each of these stations, the representative will ask the soldier if he/she has any new information to add or delete from the current information on file. If the soldier wishes to file a new will, the attorney at the legal section will draft a will for the soldier. *The medical section of the SRP includes a series of medical examinations and evaluations consistent with the PULHES Factor rating scheme, which is used to qualify an soldier's physical profile for each military skill. PULHES stands for physical capacity, upper body, lower body, hearing, eyes, and psychiatricArmy Regulation 40‚Äì501, Medical Services, Standards of Medical Fitness ARN3801 AR 40-501. The soldier can also anticipate to receive immunizations, the taking of a blood sample, electrocardiography (if needed), and a dental exam. Upon completion of this section, the soldier will meet with a health care provider. The provider will review all of the data collected on the soldier throughout the SRP to determine the overall deployability of the soldier. The soldier is then classified as medically deployable or non- deployable. It is important to note that even though a deployment for the soldier's unit may or may not necessarily be imminent or pending, soldiers are still required to complete one SRP annually.

The church was built in 1893 and demolished in July 2017. At the time of its incorporation in 1854, Atlantic City, on Absecon Island, was seen as a prime location for the development of a resort town. Although by 1874 nearly 500,000 visitors would come to the city during its peak tourist season, its resident population was comparatively minimal at 1,043 in 1870 and 5,477 in 1880. In the earliest decades of the city's history, church services, like many of the amenities and attractions in the resort town, were exclusive to the summer months when the population swelled enough to fill scattered denominational churches to capacity. By the 1870s, devout Episcopalian residents, unsettled by the lack of year-round services at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, began a movement to permanently institute religious services in Atlantic City. When the 1879 summer tourist season began, year-round church services were instituted as Alfred M. Heston, historian and author of Heston‚Äôs Handbook: Atlantic City Illustrated, wrote: ‚ÄúThe Church of the Ascension was organized as an all-the- year-round parish in 1879, principally through the efforts of Mrs. Francis W. Hemsley, the daughter of Bishop Underdonk and mother of Frederick Hemsley, present owner of the Hotel Brighton.‚ÄùAlfred Miller Heston, Absegami: Annals of Eyren Haven and Atlantic City, 1609 to 1904 (Camden, New Jersey: Sinnickson Chew & Sons Printers, 1904), 361. The Hemsleys, whose son Frederick was the grantor of the plot of land on which the church was built,Deed Book 117 (Mays Landing, New Jerse: Atlantic County Clerk‚Äôs Office, May 23, 1887), 104. were parishioners of the church who did much to establish the city as a year-round destination; according to Heston, Francis Hemsley in 1876, ‚Äúannounced that the Hotel Brighton would thereafter be conducted as an all-the-year-round hotel. Mr. Hemsley thus inaugurated the winter season which has contributed so much to the popularity of Atlantic City as a health resort. The winter and spring business at many of the hotels is now more profitable than the summer business.‚ÄùHeston, 310. Francis Hemsley had retired to Atlantic City ‚Äúin the early 70‚Äôs for the benefit of his health‚Äù before his death in 1882. Until 1900, almost all structures in Atlantic City were frame houses built of timber rather than more vigorous or durable materials.‚ÄúCompendium of Censuses 1726‚Äì1905: Together with the Tabulated Returns of 1905,‚Äù New Jersey Department of State, 1906. A.H. Mueller, ‚ÄúA. H. Mueller; 530 Locust St., Philada, PA; Publisher of Atlantic City Maps in Various Forms; Lot Plans a Specialty‚Äù (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: A. H. Muiller, Publisher, 1900). This coexistence of permanent and impermanent building traditions lasted through the early decades of the twentieth century, after which the devastation caused by several fires was significant enough to warrant construction of a more solid, fire-resistant building stock. In 1886, the original timber frame Church of the Ascension was relocated from the intersection of Michigan and Pacific avenues to its ultimate location at the northwest corner of Pacific and Kentucky avenues to suit a parish desire for a more central location. The timber frame church was demolished in 1883 to allow construction of the Spanish Renaissance-style Church of the Ascension, which was designed by Philadelphia-based architect Lindley Johnson. The development of the church from a ‚Äúframe chapel‚Äù at the intersection of Michigan and Pacific avenues to the eclectic structure that stood at the intersection of Kentucky and Pacific avenues is best summarized by an entry in The Daily Union History of Atlantic City, New Jersey: \\"Rev. J. Rice Taylor, the first rector, began regular services in June, 1880, which have been maintained without intermission ever since. Under his direction, the parish was duly incorporated January 3, 1881, entering legally and canonically into possession of the church property. Rev. Wm. H. Avery succeeded to the rectorship in February 1882 and continued in charge for some years. In 1886, the vestry, seeking a more central and convenient location bought ground at Pacific and Kentucky Avenues and with the advice and consent of the canonical authorities removed the frame chapel thither adding an annex for Sunday school purposes. Rev. J. H. Townsend became rector December 1, 1891, and laid the corner stone of the present edifice April 27, 1893, which was completed by the liberal offerings of resident and transient worshippers and opened for use May 13, 1894. This structure was designed by Mr. Lindley Johnson is in the Spanish Renaissance style and is a good example of a commodious yet inexpensive hard material building well adapted to the varying needs of this population and climate.\\"John F. Hall and George W. Bloodgood, The Daily Union History of Atlantic City, New Jersey: Containing Sketches of the Past and Present of Atlantic City and County with Maps and Illustrations Specially Prepared by John F. Hall and George W. Bloodgood (Atlantic City, New Jersey: Daily Union Print. Company, 1899), 89. The decision to commission Philadelphia-based architect Lindley Johnson to design the church is likely traceable to Francis Hemsley's son, Frederick, who had commissioned Johnson for the construction of a pair of residences in Germantown, Philadelphia, and six cottages in the Chelsea section of Atlantic City, including his residence at the intersection of Maryland and Pacific avenues.‚ÄúProject References,‚Äù National Register of Historic Places, Church of the Ascension, Atlantic City, Atlantic County, New Jersey, #86001941 In 1900, the Church of the Ascension parish house and auditorium were designed and constructed, possibly by Lindley Johnson, who was still in active practice at the time. The parish house and auditorium, which ran north along Kentucky Avenue from the rear of the church, were executed in a manner meant to balance and unify the original composition through identical coloration and materials. In 1916, fire destroyed the adjacent Overbrook Hotel (formerly the New Dunlop Hotel, Hotel Abbey, and Pacific Hotel) and several timber frame residences and resulted in five fatalities. Though some of the more sensationalist news articles would report that the church was destroyed in the blaze, Church of the Ascension survived with minimal damage except to ten stained glass panels embedded in the elevation adjacent to the hotel. Lavers & Westlake, who created the original panels, re-executed identical stained glass windows from original drawings, and all damaged windows were replaced in kind. Months later, to complete the campaign of repair and improvement, heating was installed under the pews to keep parishioners warm during service. In 1922, the eminent Philadelphia-based ecclesiastical architect Frank Rushmore Watson completed improvements to the chancel, which include the addition of four D‚ÄôAscenzo Studios stained glass windows. In about 1924, The New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, which previously had an office across the street on Pacific Avenue, constructed a five-story office tower, purchasing and demolishing the church's auditorium in the process. Church of the Ascension was inscribed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Its more recent history is included in the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form, which was initiated by members of the parish on the occasion of the church's centennial in 1984: ‚ÄúThe present lot was purchased in January 1886 and the wooden church was moved in the spring of that year. At that time, the entrance was on Kentucky Avenue. The second rector, John H. Townsend assumed the pastorate in 1891. A dynamic priest, he immediately planned a new church building. The chimes were given by the Hemsley family, and Miss Josephine Fletcher organized and directed the boys‚Äô choir which took part in the first service, held Whitsunday May 13, 1894. In the fall of 1896, a pipe organ was installed and Mr. Alber Dietz came from New York City as the first full-time organist and choir master. In 1900 this office was filled by Mr. Alger E. Weeden, who held his post for forty years and left his imprint on both the parish and the whole community. The same year also saw the construction of the parish hall buildings as well as the beginnings of St. Augustine's and All Saints‚Äô Chapels, starting the realization of Father Townsend's dream of Ascension as mother church. Soon after, Church of the Good Shepherd was built in the inlet section. ... In this, our Centennial Year, we look forward to a second century of service as a missionary parish for Christ and His Church. The parish must stand as a witness to the Catholic faith of the Episcopal Church in downtown Atlantic City. In this time of citywide transition, the Church of the Ascension offers an enduring message: ‚Äòwith God‚Äôs help, we shall be of even greater service to the community: to His great glory. ... As of this writing (November 1983) there remain two Episcopal Churches in the City of Atlantic City‚Äîthe Church of the Ascension and St. Augustine‚Äôs. Where there were once five Episcopal Churches in Atlantic City there are now just two. The Church of the Ascension being the ‚Äúmother church‚Äù must survive and become a landmark in the ever changing facade of Atlantic City.‚Äù In 2015, Church of the Ascension was closed and the historic stained glass windows were removed from the building.http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/what-will-become-of- crumbling-historic-atlantic-city- church/article_c4abea54-12fb-11e6-972c-03b8256b6ba3.html Jonathan Elliott, the director of communications for Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey at the time of the closure, was quoted in a May 2016 Press of Atlantic City article as follows: ‚Äú'It's fair to say the building was closed because it is structurally unsound,' Elliott said. He said an engineering firm determined in mid-2014 that the condition of the church, specifically the bell tower, 'presented a danger to the community' and that 'to make it safe, inhabitable and up to code would take a minimum of $2.5 million.'\\" Church of the Ascension was demolished in July 2017.

All war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law were condemned and concern was expressed at the deteriorating situation in Mostar in particular. The Council announced its determination to support efforts by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in continuing to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population. The siege of Sarajevo, Mostar and other cities was met with concern by the Council, which condemned the disruption of public utilities by the Bosnian Serb party in particular, calling on all parties to restore them. The Security Council reaffirmed that it was unacceptable to acquire territory by force and ethnic cleansing, stressing that an end to the hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina is required to achieve meaningful progress in the peace process. As the resolution determined that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security, the measures taken within it would be enacted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The Security Council called for a solution to be found during the peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, and for an immediate ceasefire in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Demands for unrestricted aid, food, water, electricity, fuel and communications were made in addition to respect for UNPROFOR and UNHCR personnel. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had indicated that the air force in support of UNPROFOR was now available. The Council reiterated that a solution to the conflict must be in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law and in that context confirmed: :(a) the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina; :(b) the fact that neither a change in the name of the country nor changes regarding its internal organisation affect membership in the United Nations; :(c) the principles adopted by the London International Conference on the former Yugoslavia, regarding the end of hostilities, the return of refugees and compensation; :(d) the right of all displaced persons to return to their homes; :(e) the preservation of Sarajevo as a multicultural, multiethnic and pluri-religious centre. The Security Council recalled that people would be held individually responsible for war crimes and violations of humanitarian law and its decision in Resolution 827 to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It concluded by declaring its readiness to assist the parties in implementing a settlement once agreed.

At 17 she left Brazil to study Fine Arts at the Parsons School of Design in New York City with Larry Rivers and at Skidmore College in upstate New York where she developed a new technique in painting with ground glass on steel. During this period she exhibited extensively in Brazil and New York. In 1982 she enrolled at the Central School of Art and Design in London to pursue her interests in printmaking with Norman Ackroyd R.A. Her own style and technique of painting uses powdered glass fused on steel and is known as ‚ÄúDiaphanism‚Äù, a term since incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary.

La Fage was born in Paris. He became a choirboy at the Saint-Philippe du Roule in 1807 and received his early musical education there. His family initially wanted him to become a Catholic priest and for a time he attended the seminary at the Saint-Nicolas- du-Chardonnet.Adrien de La Fage at musicologie.org La Fage eventually entered the Paris Conservatoire where he was a pupil of Alexandre-√âtienne Choron and Fran√ßois-Louis Perne in the subjects of harmony, counterpoint, and music history. In 1828 he was awarded a grant by Charles X of France which enabled him to pursue further studies with Giuseppe Baini in Italy. He also spent some time working for the House of Medici in Florence for whom he composed and presented the opera I Creditori at the Villa Medici in 1829. In 1830 La Fage returned to Paris to become the choir master at the Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont. He returned to Italy in 1833 where he remained for three years.

Marriage and beginning of ministry Ida Bell married Oliver Robinson in 1910. Though they never had children they adopted a niece, also named Ida Bell. The niece was the daughter of Ida Robinson's brother, Charles. Ida and Oliver left Florida for Philadelphia in hopes of finding better employment opportunities in 1917. Upon arrival to the city, Ida joined a small holiness congregation at Seventeenth and South Streets. That congregation was pastored by Elder Benjamin Smith. During her tenure at the church, Ida would at times fill in for Elder Smith when he was unable to minister. Due to her animated preaching style and her singing ability, the membership of the small congregation began to grow. Complications between her and leadership of the church eventually led to her leaving the church and affiliating herself with the United Holy Church of America where she was consecrated to the ministry through ordination. Ida Robinson was ordained in public as a \\"Gospel Preacher\\" by Bishop Henry L. Fisher. Ida Robinson was appointed as pastor of a small church in 1919. She stressed and preached holiness as a divine requirement; holiness as a work of the Holy Ghost; holiness as a condition to seeing God. The congregation began to grow quickly. However, she began to feel that ministry opportunities for women in United Holy Church were limited. Founding of Mount Sinai Holy Church of America The year of 1924 was a very important year in the life of Ida Robinson. During the beginning of 1924, Bishop Robinson on a number of occasions revealed to a number of persons that God revealed Himself through visions and dreams. It was her belief that God wanted to use her as a vehicle to establish a church that would \\"loose the women\\" and allow full clergy rights to them. While fasting and praying in the church for ten days, she stated she again received a revelation from God. She stated to members of Mount Olive that ‚ÄúThe Holy Ghost spoke and said, ‚ÄòCome out on Mount Sinai.‚Äù After receiving this message from God, Bishop Robinson was confident that she understood what God meant for her to do. On May 20, 1924, the State of Pennsylvania granted her a charter for the new organization. Keeping in mind that the call of the Holy Spirit that she envisioned, the charter for the new church was granted under the name of the Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Incorporated. At the time of its founding, the church leadership consisted of nine officials. Out of the nine officials, six were women. The growth of Mount Sinai was rapid and quickly spread across the east coast of the United States. Elder Robinson was consecrated as bishop at the organization's first Holy Convocation in 1925. Her separation from United Holy Church was one of mutual agreement. Leaders of her parent organization were in attendance at the first Holy Convocation of Mount Sinai and continued to fellowship with the organization during her leadership and after. End of life On April 6, 1946, Ida Robinson left Philadelphia with a group of missionaries to visit some of the organization's churches in Florida. Her first stop in Florida was Jacksonville. From there she journeyed on to Winter Haven. Upon arrival to Winter Haven, Florida, she fell very ill. On April 20, Bishop Ida Robinson died. When she died, the denomination consisted of 84 churches, more than 160 ordained ministers of whom 125 were women, an accredited school in Philadelphia, mission work in Cuba and Guyana, and a farm in South Jersey that provided a safe haven away from the city for church members.

It could be used like a subnotebook, but was light enough to be comfortably used handheld as well. Most Palmtop PCs were small enough to be stored in a user's shirt or jacket pocket. Palmtop PCs distinguish from other palmtop computers by using a mostly IBM-compatible PC architecture and BIOS as well as an Intel-compatible x86 processor. All such devices were DOS-based, with DOS stored in ROM. While many Palmtop PCs came with a number of PDA and office applications pre-installed in ROM, most of them could also run generic, off-the-shelf PC software with no or little modifications. Some could also run other operating systems such as GEOS, Windows 1.0-3.0 (in Real mode only), or MINIX 2.0. Most Palmtop PCs were based on a static hardware design for low power consumption and instant-on/off without the need to reboot. Depending on the model, the battery could power the device for a period ranging from several hours up to several days while running, or between a week and a year in standby mode. Combined with the instant-on/off feature, a battery would typically last from a week up to several months in practical use as PDA.

Bruce J. Dinges, \\"FORT QUITMAN,\\" Handbook of Texas Online The fort, now a ghost town, was named for former Mississippi Governor John A. Quitman, a strongly pro-slavery politician and leading Fire Eater who served as a major general under Zachary Taylor during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1963, Recorded Historic Texas Landmark number 2007 was placed at the county courthouse, honoring Fort Quitman. Establishment Fort Quitman was established on September 28, 1858, by units of the 8th Infantry Regiment. The first troops were under the command of Captain Arthur T. Lee and included 86 officers and men. Their mission was to protect the San Antonio‚ÄìEl Paso Road. It was a station on the route of the mail coaches of the San Antonio‚ÄìSan Diego Mail Line and later the Butterfield Overland Mail. By 1860 the garrison had been reduced to one officer Second Lieutenant Zenas Bliss (who would retire from the Army in 1897 as a brigadier general) and 20 men. On the outbreak of the American Civil War, Texas joined the Confederacy. Lieutenant Bliss and his men were ordered to march to San Antonio with other troops evacuating West Texas garrisons. They believed they would be put on ships and sent to the North, but instead were captured and held as prisoners of war. Bliss was later exchanged and rose to the rank of colonel of volunteers. His promotion to general grade was probably hindered by his having been a prisoner of war. Confederate Texas troops under Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley passed through the post on their way to the New Mexico Campaign in December 1861. The remnants of his army also passed by the post after their defeat. There is no evidence that Confederate troops ever permanently garrisoned the fort. The fort was inspected by troops from the California Column looking for any evidence of further Confederate activity or stragglers in 1863, but did not see any need to garrison the post. The Fort was regarrisoned in January 1868 by Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th Cavalry Regiment and 42 Infantry under command of Major Albert Payson Morrow of the 9th Cavalry. Much of the post was in bad condition and was never fully restored. Soldiers would complain about adobe from the walls falling into their bunks as the slept due to the poor condition of the buildings. It has been stated, \\"No worse site for a military post could ever be conceived.\\" It was all but totally isolated from civilization with mountain ranges running down both sides of the river. Any attempts at cultivating gardens to help with food supplies met with little success. Expeditions against the Apache in the Sacramento Mountains were mounted from Fort Quitman, but they met with little success. Gradually the garrison was reduced to a single company of infantry. The last unit, Company B of the 25th Infantry Regiment, left in January 1877. The post itself was burned later that year by an angry mob from San Elizario during the San Elizario Salt War. The rioters destroyed it in protest of federal support of a rival faction. It was temporarily reoccupied as a sub-post of Fort Davis by troops from the 10th Cavalry Regiment from 1880 to 1882 during Victorio's War. The building of the Southern Pacific Railroad through the pass in the mountains north-west of the post, effectively by-passing it, eliminated the need for this post.

Founded in 1871 by Dr. Charles A. Leas, the village is located in the northwest section of Baltimore County and is primarily a residential suburb of metropolitan Baltimore City. The village is characterized by the predominance of historic Victorian homes and a strong sense of community among its residents. Glyndon is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1973) and on the Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties (1973); the Glyndon Historic District was also designated as the first historic district in Baltimore County (1981). A roadside sign marking Historic Glyndon. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Worthington Valley Historic District. History Glyndon still maintains much of the charm it had as a Victorian summer village over 100 years ago. The arrival of the Western Maryland Rail Road in 1860 promoted the early location and growth of Glyndon. The area itself was beautiful with green expanses and tall trees; an elevation above sea level of almost 700 feet provided delightful summers and mild winters. Prior to 1871, Dr. Charles A. Leas, the first health officer of Baltimore City and a former American consul, made several purchases of land in what is now Glyndon. When he discovered that farming was not his metier, he decided to found a small town. He employed the Baltimore surveyor Augustus Bouldin to lay out the lots and streets, planting rows of maples along the avenues. Baltimore County businessman Samuel P. Townsend also promoted the growth of the town with his purchase and development of a substantial number of acres. He assumed an active role in the community as a merchant, a railroad agent, and a postmaster. Affluent Baltimorians acquired summer homes in early Glyndon to escape the heat of the city. The proximity of the railroad to Glyndon allowed easy commuting for the businessmen to their jobs in the city some 25 miles away. Two- and three-story Victorian homes, with large airy rooms, wide halls from front to rear, and spacious porches, was the type of architecture chosen by the majority of the builders. Additionally, several boarding houses invited city folks to live in the country during the summer months. A small business district grew up around the railroad station to service the needs of Glyndon's growing population. Besides the station, along Railroad Avenue there were a post office, a general store, a town hall, a blacksmith shop, a livery, a wheelwright shop, and an ice cream parlor. Along nearby Chatsworth Avenue (originally Reisterstown Avenue) there were a general store, a bakery, a butchery, an ice house, a carpenter, and the town magistrate's office. There was, however, no candlestick maker. The Western Maryland Railway and a later streetcar line, the Pikesville, Reisterstown & Emory Grove Railway, also brought summer people to Emory Grove, a Methodist religious campground founded before Glyndon in 1868. Across Butler Road (what was then called Dover Road) to the south is Glyndon Park, established in 1887 as a temperance camp meeting ground, the first of its kind in the nation south of the Mason and Dixon's Line. In 1878, the Glyndon United Methodist Church(then called the Glyndon Methodist Episcopal Church) was constructed on Dover Road. The original brown-shingled chapel was destroyed by fire in 1929 and the present stone structure was dedicated in 1931. In 1873 the cornerstone was laid for Sacred Heart Church, at the time the only Catholic church between Westminster and Baltimore. The handsome Gothic structure was built with marble from the nearby quarry at the foot of ‚ÄúDark Hollow Hill‚Äù (the Hill now being part of Butler Road). There were two schools in the immediate area. St. George‚Äôs Hall, located at the end of Central Avenue where Bond Avenue crosses the railroad tracks (506 Bond), was established by Prof. J. C. Kinear in 1876 as a private boarding school for boys. Unfortunately the building was razed by fire in 1896; it was replaced with the current structure. The two-room Glyndon School on Butler Road was built in 1887 when the growing year-round population of Glyndon necessitated a public school. The school house was abandoned in 1930 after consolidation with Franklin Elementary School in Reisterstown. In 1932 it became the home of the Woman‚Äôs Club of Glyndon. The Club was originally established in 1898 by some ladies who were ‚Äúsummering‚Äù in Glyndon and who gathered on a regular basis on a neighbor's porch to read together. They called themselves the Glyndon Porch Class. Today the Woman's Club of Glyndon promotes literary and social activities as well as interest in local civic problems and in national and world affairs. The Glyndon Volunteer Fire Department has been active since 1904. Over the years its members have worked hard to provide the most modern and effective fire protection possible for the residents of the Glyndon community and of the surrounding area. The Ladies Auxiliary, organized in 1953, helps with this mission by raising funds for the work of the Company. Geography Glyndon is located at a latitude of 39.4764935 North and a longitude of 76.8158100 West at an elevation of 689 feet. Butler Road, formerly Dover Road, is the main road. Demographics According to the 2000 census, the population of Glyndon was 424 (female 210, male 214). The median age was 39.6. The average household size was 2.72 and the average family size 3.30. The population was 96.5% White, 1.2% Black, 0.5% Asian, 1.9% of two or more races and 0.2% Hispanic/Latino. Of the population aged 25 and over, 96.1% had achieved high school graduation or higher and 51.3% a bachelor's degree or higher. Education Public schools The public schools serving the children of Glyndon are: * Franklin Elementary * Franklin Middle * Franklin High Franklin High School is the oldest high school in Baltimore County, founded in Reisterstown in 1820 as the private school Franklin Academy.Reister‚Äôs Desire‚ÄîReisterstown, 1758-1976. Compiled by Carrol Pollack. 1976. Local lore contends that Edgar Allan Poe applied to be principal of the Academy in the 1830s but was turned down by the school's trustees. Students may opt to attend a number of magnet schools within the public school system. Private schools Some Glyndon children attend nearby Sacred Heart School (K-8), a Catholic parish school. Others attend any number of private schools in the greater Baltimore area, such as * Gilman School * St. Paul's School * St. Paul's School for Girls * Boys' Latin School of Maryland * Friends School of Baltimore * Maryvale Preparatory School * Loyola Blakefield * Calvert Hall College High School * Garrison Forest School * Bryn Mawr School * McDonogh School Higher education There are a number of institutions of higher learning within a 25-mile radius of Glyndon, offering various levels and intensity of education: * Stevenson University * University of Maryland, Baltimore County * McDaniel College * Towson University * Goucher College * Loyola University Maryland * Notre Dame of Maryland University * Johns Hopkins University * Maryland Institute College of Art * University of Baltimore * Coppin State University * Community College of Baltimore County * Carroll Community College Community organizations Glyndon Community Association (GCA) The exact date of the first community association meeting in Glyndon is not known, but by early 1945 several community leaders and residents decided to formalize the activities of their group. On February 28, 1945, the group was incorporated under the name of The Glyndon Corporation. According to the original corporate charter, the founding fathers of GCA were Thomas Kooken, Donald P. Bellows, Eugene H. Ryer, as the incorporators; Mr. Bellows, along with John O. Cockey, Rosemund E. Smith, and Ira L. Wales as the first members of the board of directors. Bellows was also the first resident agent. The name of the community association was changed to the Glyndon Community Association in 1956. The Board of Directors approved the name change on April 23, 1956, and the membership approved the name change at the May 3 membership meeting. The formal change of name was registered with the charter division of the State of Maryland on July 27, 1956. As stated in its bylaws, the purpose of the GCA is to promote and maintain a strong community spirit in Glyndon, to bring about improved conditions in all things that affect the community in general, and to promote other non-profit purposes. Membership is open to all individuals 18 years or older who own or occupy residential real property in Glyndon. GCA also has an emeritus membership which is limited to past members of GCA who no longer qualify as a regular member and whose request for Esuch status has been approved by GCA. Membership dues are minimal and a family discount is available. For the purposes of GCA, Glyndon is the area within a line that generally runs from Emory Grove, including Seven Farms at Worthington Valley, east to Butler Road, across Worthington Avenue, then south to the south side of St. Paul Avenue, out to Central Avenue, north along Central to 350 Central and then west to the railroad tracks and then north across Butler Road back to Emory Grove. GCA holds its annual meeting, at which its officers and directors are elected, in February. GCA also holds quarterly membership meetings. The board is composed of a president, a first and second vice president, a secretary, a treasurer, six directors elected at large and the immediate past president of GCA. The term of office is one year for officers and two years for directors to ensure both participation from the entire neighborhood and the preservation of institutional memory. GCA sponsors several events during the course of the year, all currently without charge to the public, even those outside of Glyndon proper. For many years there has been an Easter Egg Hunt. Currently, this is held the Saturday before Easter in Glyndon Station Park, preceded the night before by an egg-stuffing event held at a neighborhood home and attended exclusively by parents. A long-standing tradition of GCA has been a parade on Independence Day. The parade commences at 10:00 am at the intersection of Albright and Central avenues and proceeds north to Chatsworth, turns left to Railroad Avenue, and then again to the starting point and the historic O‚ÄôMeara lawn. There, the federal flag is affixed to the end of an extended fire-truck ladder, a prayer is said, and all join in the singing of the national anthem, followed by hot dogs, lemonade and cookies. The parade is in essence a bike parade with children and adults marching the route. The Glyndon Volunteer Fire Department leads the event with one of its trucks, accompanied on occasion by a historic vehicle or lawn tractor. In autumn, there is a Halloween Party at the firehouse and, at Christmas, GCA lights a local tree and sings carols at its Christmas Tree Lighting and Festival of Carols Without Lessons. Historic Glyndon, Inc.(HGI) Historic Glyndon, Inc. was founded in 1972. It began as a committee under the aegis of the Glyndon Community Association and became a separate organization after the town's centennial in 1971. This organization is responsible for having had Glyndon declared a historic district at three levels: national, state and county. HGI's mission is \\"to preserve and protect Glyndon‚Äôs cultural, social, economic and architectural history, as well as to conduct educational and beautification projects which enrich Glyndon‚Äôs historical heritage.\\" The organization consists of officers (president, 1st vice- president, 2nd vice-president, treasurer and secretary), nine additional board members, a number of committees and a general membership. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in Glyndon and its mission. The committees include Membership, Architectural Design & Review, Historic House Plaques' Welcome and Holiday Open House Regular events of HGI include the annual spring meeting of the general membership, a spring clean-up around the train station and post office, a biennial fall Celebrate Glyndon! display, and the Holiday Open House in December. Other endeavors have included the publication of a history book about the village (Glyndon: The Story of a Victorian Village, 1990), a 125th anniversary weekend celebration in 1996, historic town markers, historic street signs, historic house plaques and a house and garden tour. Famous/renowned residents Dr. Charles A. Leas Dr. Charles A. Leas, Glyndon's founder, was Baltimore City's first public health officer. During the Crimean War, he went to Russia at the request of the Russian Minister to serve on the army's medical staff. For this service, he was knighted by Czar Alexander II with the Imperial Order of St. Stanislaus. After the war, President Buchanan appointed him U.S. Consul to Russia. In subsequent years, he also served as American Consul to Sweden, Madeira and British Honduras. Leas eventually returned to Baltimore and shortly thereafter retired and moved to the country. A Baltimore Sun article from February 13, 1952, states, \\"He soon found that running a farm was not his m√©tier, so he decided to found a little town, where he could live amongst congenial people of his own tastes and inclinations.\\" The entrance to the Leas homestead, the oldest home in Glyndon, is located at the corner of Albright and Railroad avenues. The main part of the dwelling, more than 200 years old, was originally a farmhouse when bought by Leas and his second wife, Elizabeth Frush, who was known as Lizzie. Leas had three daughters, two with his first wife Eliza Moore Leas, who died in 1850, and one with Lizzie. T. Rowe Price Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founder of the investment firm T. Rowe Price, was born in Glyndon in 1898 and spent his childhood there in the home that his father built at 4801 Butler Road. His father was T. Rowe Price, Sr., a country doctor who raised three children in Glyndon with his wife Ella (n√©e Black). The young Price graduated from nearby Franklin High School in 1914 and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1919 from Swarthmore College.

Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, Patience, Iolanthe and The Mikado, in which the principal character, Able Seaman Dick Deadeye, is sent by Queen Victoria on a quest to recover the \\"Ultimate Secret\\" from the Sorcerer, who has stolen it. The music is borrowed from many Savoy operas, with new or modified lyrics by Robin Miller and orchestrations updated in a contemporary (1975) popular style by the soundtrack conductor, Jimmy Horowytz. Animation and direction were by Bill Melendez, who produced the Charlie Brown television cartoons, based on character drawings by veteran cartoonist Ronald Searle. The film's release was accompanied by the original release of a deluxe-jacketed LP soundtrack recording and a colourful storybook by Jeremy Hornsby, with colourful Searle-inspired art. Synopsis Queen Victoria sends Dick Deadeye (Victor Spinetti), a sailor, to recover the \\"Ultimate Secret\\" from two thieves, the Sorcerer (Peter Reeves) and his reptilian henchman, the Shameleon. They are trying to sell it to the Pirate King (George Cooper, sung Ian Samwell). At a military parade (\\"Entrance of the Peers\\"), Dick sees the Sorcerer speaking with the Pirate King. There, Nanki (John Newton, sung Casey Kelly) sees his evil twin brother Poo (same), who is picking pockets. Dick goes for backup to headquarters, the Hexagon (\\"Here's a how-dee-do\\"), finding the Captain (Peter Reeves) and the Major-General (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry; \\"I am the very model of a modern major general\\"). Dick then goes to the pirates' lair, \\"The Queen's Nose\\" (\\"Oh, better far to live and die\\"). There, Rose Maybud (Julia McKenzie, sung Liza Strike), the barmaid, wants to find \\"a man of pure evil\\", so she can reform him. She and Dick have a moment (\\"Prithee, pretty maiden\\"), but she loses interest, since he is good. The Sorcerer and his sidekick arrive (\\"My name is John Wellington Wells\\"). The Pirate King finalises the deal to buy the Secret for a modest sum of pirate booty, and the Sorcerer goes to get it, followed by Dick. Dick arrives at the Sorcerer's shop and asks for a potion to make him handsome (\\"Sprites of earth and air\\") and makes a grab for the Secret, but it falls through the window into the basket of Little Buttercup (Miriam Karlin), a buxom seller of ribbons, laces and marine supplies. Poo steals the basket, and everyone chases him, including three policemen (\\"A policeman's lot is not a happy one\\"), but they mistake Nanki for Poo and arrest him. The Judge at his trial (Barry Cryer, \\"All hail great Judge\\"; \\"Now, Jurymen, hear my advice\\") flirts with Little Buttercup (\\"I'm called Little Buttercup\\"), ignores Nanki's evidence (\\"A wandering minstrel I\\" and \\"I swear to tell the truth\\" based on \\"When I go out of door\\"), sentences Nanki to 200 years in the Tower of London (\\"A Judge is he, and a good judge too\\") and leaves with Little Buttercup. At the Tower, Nanki muses on his lot and lost love (\\"Farewell my love\\"). The spirit of Yum- Yum (Linda Lewis, sung Beth Porter) is trapped in Nanki's shamisen (\\"Just as the moon must have the sun\\", based on \\"The sun whose rays\\") and needs Nanki \\"to make me a whole woman\\". Poo is willing to return the Secret to the Sorcerer in exchange for learning his tricks, but the pirates drag them to \\"The Queen's Neck\\". The Secret in code, and the Sorcerer must decipher it. Since Poo is \\"the most evil man in the world\\", Rose decides her love for him and intends to reform him. Meanwhile, at the Hexagon, Dick sees the Rear- Admiral (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry; \\"I am the monarch of the sea\\") and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts. He gives the Captain (\\"He remains an Englishman\\") command of the 'Pinafore' and allows Dick to recruit a crew from the prisoners, and at the Tower, Nanki sings for the prisoners (\\"The flowers that bloom in the spring\\": Prisoner sung by Ian Samwell), who nearly all enlist. The Sorcerer and Poo are on the pirate ship (\\"Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry\\"). Rose Maybud, disguised as a pirate, sneaks aboard. Meanwhile, the Captain, accompanied by the Judge, Major-General, Rear-Admiral takes command of the 'Pinafore' (\\"When I was a lad\\"; \\"We sail the ocean blue\\"; and \\"I am the Captain of the Pinafore\\"). They pursue the pirate ship, assisted by two giant cherubs (\\"Go, ye heroes\\"); meanwhile Poo overfeeds the Sorcerer who gets seasick and hands over the Secret. When the two crews meet, they greet each other warmly. The Pirate King fights the Captain, but the King's trousers fall, and the strawberry birthmark on his backside is seen. Little Buttercup has a secret (\\"A many years ago\\"); as a wetnurse, she mixed up the infant Pirate King and the Captain (recognisable by the birthmark). Poo sails to the nearby island of Utopia with the Secret, now pursued by everyone (\\"With cat- like tread\\"). He meets the Regent of Utopia, the Princess Zara (Miriam Karlin) and her court of show-girls. They all sing (\\"Hail, hail, and how-dee-do\\", based on \\"With cat-like tread\\"; \\"Land of sand and sea and sun\\", in the style of The Beach Boys). Zara has Poo arrested. The Sorcerer regains the Secret and is chased by Dick and the Captain. They find that the Secret is in mirror- writing, and decipher it: \\"It's love that makes the world go round\\" (\\"If you go in\\"). Nanki and Poo combine into a person composed of both good and evil. The shamisen releases the spirit of Yum Yum (the Queen of Utopia). The Sorcerer falls in love with Little Buttercup, while Rose Maybud and Dick are reunited. Once the Secret is out, war and crime cease around the world (\\"Here's a how-dee-do\\") and all live happily ever after (\\"Entrance of the Peers\\", reprise).

The depot is located on the southwest corner of Virginia Avenue and Central Avenue. It opened as a station on the White Oak Railway in 1903 and later became part of the Virginian Railway, which it served until 1957. From this year until closure in 1983, it operated as a depot for the Norfolk and Western Railway. The depot now serves as the meeting place for the White Oak chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. It is the only remaining Virginian Railway depot in West Virginia. History The Oak Hill Railroad Depot opened in 1903 on the White Oak Railway, a subsidiary of the White Oak Coal Company. The depot served a line from Glen Jean to coal mines in Summerlee and Lochgelly; it initially served as both a checkpoint for coal cars from these mines and a freight and passenger station for the newly incorporated town of Oak Hill. The station's opening led to a commercial boom in Oak Hill, which transformed from a farming community to a commercial center with multiple banks, hotels, and stores. The Virginian Railway leased the depot in 1912 and ultimately bought it in 1922. The depot continued to provide passenger and freight service to Oak Hill until after World War II, when passenger service to Oak Hill ended . The depot became part of the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1957 and provided freight service for the railway until it closed to trains in 1983. The Norfolk Southern Corp., the holding company for the Norfolk and Western Railway, donated the closed depot to the city of Oak Hill in 1995. The White Oak chapter of the National Railway Historical Society has since restored the depot through donations and a U.S. Department of Transportation grant. Oak Hill began an annual festival known as Depot Day in 1997 to raise money to restore the depot. The depot presently serves as a meeting place for the White Oak chapter of the National Railway Historical Society but is otherwise vacant; it is the sole surviving Virginian Railway depot in West Virginia. In 2013, the station caught fire in a suspected arson attempt and suffered slight damage. Structure The Oak Hill Railroad Depot is a one-story wooden building located on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Virginia Street, along the Norfolk Southern Railway tracks. It has a board and batten siding with Victorian features, a style representative of small-town railway depots of the early 1900s. The original depot consisted of a passenger waiting area and a station master's office. A warehouse, loading dock, and ramp were added to the depot in 1922. Restoration on the depot began in 1993, at which point it was painted a period shade of gray. Behind the depot, there is a small steam locomotive.

StudiVZ Ltd., No. 08-03468 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 18, 2008) (Complaint). Since 2008 Facebook has been available in the German language.Sekan Toto, Facebook Recruits Street Troops To Grow in Germany, Inside Tech Crunch.com (September 25, 2008). In October 2005 StudiVZ launched its website by two students from Berlin, Ehssan Dariani and Dennis Bemmann. StudiVZ is an abbreviation of the German term Studentenverzeichnis or Studienverzeichnis, which means \\"students' directory\\". StudiVZ became popular in Germany and subsequently launched several other websites designed to target high school students and students in other European countries. In 2006 Facebook learned of StudiVZ's website and, believing that the StudiVZ website infringed its proprietary trade dress, Facebook sent a demand letter to StudiVZ. The letter alleged a series of potential claims for infringement of Facebook's intellectual property rights under German law. A similar letter was sent in January 2007.Facebook, Inc. v. StudiVZ Ltd., No. 08-03468, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40941 (N.D. Cal. May 4, 2009) (Order deferring ruling on motions to dismiss). Facebook argued that StudiVZ copied the look, feel, features and services of Facebook.com. In August 2006 and October 2007 Facebook began negotiations to purchase StudiVZ's websites.Caroline McCarthy, \\"Report: Facebook tried to buy StudiVZ\\", Inside News.cnet.com (August 8, 2008) After the negotiations failed, Facebook sent demand letters to Holtzbrinck (Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, that acquired StudiVZ in 2007) again alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. On July 18, 2008, StudiVZ filed a declaratory judgment action against Facebook in the German regional court of Stuttgart in order to declare the claims by Facebook without merit.\\"Facebook challenges German rival\\", Inside News.bbc.co.uk (July 21, 2008) The same day, Facebook filed a complaint against StudiVZ Ltd., Verlagsgruppe Georg Von Holtzbrinck GmbH (German entity), Holtzbrinck Networks GmbH (German entity), Holtzbrinck Ventures GmbH (German entity) with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, demanding StudiVZ desist from running a \\"knock-off\\" of Facebook's website. and filed motions to dismiss based on a lack of personal jurisdiction and on the grounds that Germany was a more convenient forum. Facebook was represented by some of the same attorneys that handled its case with the Winklevoss twins, including Neel Chatterjee and Julio Avalos of the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (that case became the basis of the academy-award winning film The Social Network). StudiVZ was represented by Los Angeles-based entertainment law firm Greenberg Glusker. On October 22, 2008, StudiVZ,Facebook, Inc. v. StudiVZ Ltd., No. 08-03468 (N.D. Cal.

On November 19, 2008, Facebook filed a second lawsuit for injunctive relief against StudiVZ in the German regional court of Cologne, alleging a series of claims under German law.Sekan Toto, Facebook Loses Lawsuit Against German Clone StudiVZ, Gets Criticized For Sloppy Preparation, Inside Tech Crunch.com (June 16, 2009).Facebook takes 'knockoff' German site StudiVZ to court , Inside The Local.de (April 29, 2009). On May 4, 2009, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order indicating its view that Germany was the more appropriate forum, but deferred making a final decision on the issue until further review of the issues of personal jurisdiction could be addressed. District Court for the Northern District of California=Facebook's claims Facebook alleged five different causes of action: *Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (). Facebook alleged that StudiVZ was not authorized to log in and use Facebook's site or services for the purpose of copying its web pages, copying its design, copying its features or copying its trade dress. Facebook also alleged that StudiVZ was not authorized to access Facebook's computer servers beyond the terms set forth in Facebook's terms of use, which StudiVZ allegedly violated by (among other things) using Facebook's servers for commercial purposes without authorization. *Violation of California Penal Code ¬ß502(c)(2). Facebook alleged that StudiVZ knowingly accessed and without permission, took, copied, or made use of data from a computer, computer system, or computer network, or took or copied supporting documentation in violation of California Penal Code ¬ß502(c)(2). *Trade dress infringement (). Facebook alleged that the unique look and feel of Facebook's website and services, including its graphical user interface, constituted protectable trade dress and that its user interface was unique, recognizable, and not merely functional.Aharon Etengoff, Facebook sues German competitor, Inside Theinquirer.net (Jul. 21, 2008). Facebook alleged that StudiVZ has copied Facebook's trade dress in a manner likely to cause confusion or to deceive users as to the affiliation, connection, or association of the StudiVZ websites with Facebook or as to deceive users as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the StudiVZ goods, services or commercial activities. *Breach of contract. Facebook alleged that by using or registering to use its website and service, StudiVZ consented to Facebook's terms of use, thereby entering into a valid contract with Facebook. Misappropriating Facebook's intellectual property or using Facebook for an unauthorized commercial purpose is in breach of the Terms of Use. *Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts entered into in the State of California. By agreeing to the Facebook's terms of use, Facebook alleged that StudiVZ entered into a California contract with Facebook and through their actions, also violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. StudiVZ and Holtzbrinck Networks' position StudiVZ and its owner, Holtzbrinck Networks GmbH, denied the claimsHelen Chernikoff, German site sued by Facebook says claims without merit, Inside Reuters.com (Jul. 20, 2008). and filed motions to dismiss based on a lack of personal jurisdiction and on the grounds that Germany was a more convenient forum. Ruling On May 4, 2009, the California Court deferred ruling with respect to forum non conveniens until the issue of personal jurisdiction could be fairly presented. The court also held that no choice-of- law determination was required here because neither the Lanham Act nor the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) contain a special venue provision. Under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, courts have broad discretion to decline jurisdiction in favor of a more convenient forum. A party moving to dismiss based on forum non conveniens must show (i) the existence of an adequate alternative forum and (ii) that the balance of private and public interest factors weighs in favor of dismissal.Facebook, Inc. v. StudiVZ Ltd, Inside casesofinterest.com. To determine whether to dismiss an action, the court must determine (i) the degree of deference properly accorded the plaintiff's choice of forum, (ii) whether the alternative forum proposed by the defendants is adequate to adjudicate the parties' dispute and (iii) a balance between the private and public interests implicates in the choice of forum. Facebook, as the plaintiff, would ordinarily be accorded a great deal of deference in choice of forum. However, because Facebook is a multinational corporation with \\"a significant business presence in Germany,\\" was currently litigating a similar suit in Germany and the conduct complained of occurred principally in Germany, Facebook's choice of forum was given reduced deference. The court indicated that it believed that Germany was an adequate forum because it would permit adequate litigation of the subject matter in dispute. Settlement On September 10, 2009 a settlement was reached resulting in StudiVZ paying an undisclosed sum to FacebookJustin Smith, Facebook Settles Suit Against StudiVZ, but Germans Already Moving to Facebook Anyway, Inside Facebook.com (Sep. 10, 2009). and on September 14, 2009 the California case was dismissed with prejudice per the parties' stipulation.Facebook, Inc. v. StudiVZ Ltd., No. 08-03468 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 14, 2009) (Stipulation and order for dismissal with prejudice). Decision by the German regional court Unlike the proceedings before the U.S. District Court, the parties did not settle their lawsuit in Germany. On June 16, 2009, the German regional court of Cologne decided against Facebook regarding the action for injunctive relief (33 O 374/08). The declaratory judgment action before the regional court of Stuttgart therefore became obsolete. In Germany, Facebook had sued StudiVZ on grounds of unfair competition, trademark infringement and copyright infringement. Unfair competition Facebook alleged in its unfair competition charges that StudiVZ is a mere imitation of Facebook and therefore free rides on their good will. This imitation would subsequently lead to consumer confusion as to the source of the StudiVz website. Additionally, an impeded market of Facebook in the German market originated from improper access to Facebook's website by one of the founders of StudiVZ while staying in the United States for an internship. Further, Facebook based the improper access allegation on several security blackouts throughout 2007. This unfair competition claim was rejected by the court on several grounds. First, the court held that an imitation leading to confusion as to the source of the websites and the associated free riding on the goodwill of Facebook's website requires a certain degree of public awareness of the website. However, at the time of the introduction of StudiVz to the German market (November 2005) Facebook had not yet established the critical level of awareness in order to justify a claim for improper imitation of a famous website. Rather, until September 2006, Facebook was only designed for North American students and thus did not reach the required degree of public awareness. Concerning the improper access of Facebook's secret information, the court found the allegations set forth by Facebook improper in order to justify the claim. Neither could Facebook prove any illegal appropriation of the source code, nor was the information accessed by one of the founders of StudiVZ as a registered member of Facebook improperly obtained. Equally, the reliance on general security blackouts was found insufficient. Finally, the court rejected the unfair competition claim based on impediment of market entry by Facebook. After launching their German version in 2008, Facebook achieved tremendous success. Further, the court held that the alleged copying of several functions of Facebook (like the wall, the group or the poke function) are merely unprotectable ideas not covered by the imitation prohibitions of unfair competition law. Trademark As to the trademark claim, the court acknowledged that the Facebook logo serves as a trademark, but was as such not used by the defendant. The design of a website can assume trademark quality as well, but only if the design is to a high degree remarkable. The court held that such a distinctiveness was not achieved by Facebook, where the logo is clearly located apart from the design, which is in its remaining parts mostly simple and functional. Copyright The court later decided to address the question of copyright infringement. According to German law, only copying of the source code would constitute copyright infringement. But that there are similarities in the design, structure and function of the two networks could equally derive from a conscious imitation of the other website without directly accessing and copying of the source code of Facebook. The reference to Facebook's web appearance could have simply happened by using the publicly available HTML texts and stylesheets when programming StudiVZ. Even if the programmer of StudiVZ was given the concrete task to create a website in the style of Facebook, this does not constitute copyright infringement according to German Copyright law, see ¬ß69a German Copyright Act Mere similarities between the two websites are not enough to demonstrate with sufficient probability a copying of the source code. Breach of contract claim Finally the court rejected a contract claim on the grounds that defendant was never a registered member of Facebook.

As well as a career in botany, he also taught his love of botany to all who would listen through talks to children, special interest groups, walks on Canberra'a Black Mountain and more recently through the U3A (University of the Third Age), both in class and online. He knew the value of planting local native plants in gardens as they would survive local conditions and save water. Chippendale was born in Sydney, Australia, the eldest of six, and grew up in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. He left school at 14. After a short stint as a draper, his Mother helped him get a job at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney in 1936 as the tea boy. He stayed working at the Gardens until serving in the Australian Army during World War II. In 1943 he married Joan. Post war, he returned to the Gardens and due to his army service, was able to study for a Bachelor of Science at Sydney University. He made lifelong friends at the Gardens who mentored him during his university study and future career. Part of his work at the Gardens was to identify plants brought in by members of the public which gave George a broad background in plant identification. In 1954 Chippendale moved to Alice Springs with his wife and 3 children as the first resident taxonomist, a job which he loved. When he arrived in Alice Springs only a small collection of specimens existed, these having been gathered by members of CSIRO, various veterinary officers and stock inspectors of the Animal Industry Branch. No public herbarium existed in the Northern Territory at that time and Chippendale's responsibilities extended throughout the Northern Territory. He made many trips into the bush with colleagues and assistants to collect plant specimens. These specimens were the basis for the present Northern Territory Herbarium. As an avid plant specimen collector and describer, George had more than eight plants named after him including: Acacia chippendalei, Bassia chippendalei, Corymbia chippendalei, Levenhookia chippendalei, Minuria chippendalei, Ptilotus chippendalei, Sesbania chippendalei and Solanum chippendalei. Chippendale's work was aimed at benefiting the pastoral industry, and he secured a special knowledge of the dry country in the Southern half of the Northern Territory. Despite a fourth child and many trips into the bush to collect specimens, he found time to write and publish some 25 papers, one of which was of considerable economic importance to the region, Topfeed; the fodder trees and shrubs of Central Australia. In 1961 Chippendale and family, travelling to visit family in Sydney, were involved in a car accident near Maryborough, Queensland resulting in the loss of his wife and youngest daughter. He suffered many broken bones, but signed himself out of hospital to return to Alice Springs to care for his three elder children. Chippendale married Thelma (13 February 1921 - 22 August 2011), in 1963 and celebrated the birth of a fifth child prior to moving to Canberra in 1966 to take up the position of senior botanist in the then Forestry Research Institute, which became the Division of Forestry Research, CSIRO. He chose the position over a possible stint as the Director of the Botanic Gardens in Canberra due to his preference to continue with pure botany rather than administrative tasks. His main specialisation became the genus Eucalyptus. For twelve months during 1972-73 Chippendale became the Botanical Liaison Officer at Kew Gardens in England where he examined type material of Eucalypts, also travelling to several European herbaria to examine similar material. This helped him prepare a technical note, Herbarium Specimens of Eucalyptus Photographed in Europe as well as a record of those who had collected the material. Chippendale contributed to a steady stream of books either alone or as a collaborator, including: Eucalyptus Buds and Fruit; Illustrations of the Buds and Fruits of the Genus the List of Authentic Specimens from Which the Drawings Were Made (1968), Eucalypts (1969), The Forest Trees of Australia (1970), Australian Rain Forest Trees (1970), Wildflowers of the Australian Capital Territory (1972, with wife Thelma) and Eucalypts of the Western Australian goldfields (and the adjacent wheatbelt) (1973).Hall, Norman (1978) ‚ÄúBotanists of the Eucalypts‚Äù, Melbourne, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization The Natural Distribution of Eucalyptus in Australia (1981) was completed with George taking advantage of computer generated illustrations (by Ludek Wolf). Using the computer generated illustrations to show where Eucalypts occurred naturally was acknowledged by botanists and others worldwide as a first. Chippendale's final work was completed in retirement, the sole author of book 19 of the Flora of Australia ‚Äì Myrtaceae ‚Äì Eucalypts, Angophora (1988) for which he was awarded a Bicentennial Australia Day Medallion. Chippendale was survived by 4 children, 10 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren. A plaque was unveiled to celebrate Chippendale's contribution to Australian botany at the Australian National Botanic Gardens on the edge of the Eucalypt Lawn on 9 June 2010.

It runs north-south from Morganton to Newland. Route description Jonas Ridge Chestnut Mountain, from the Brown Mountain Overlook Pineola The route serves as the main road from Morganton to Northern Burke County then on towards Newland in Avery County. The first of the road appears as a regular back road highway, going by homes and shrubbery farms. At Brown Mountain Beach Road, the sharp bend of the highway starts the climb up through the Pisgah National Forest to Jonas Ridge. This section of the highway features multiple curves (some tight with speed warnings), multiple passing lanes (five up, two down, one turnoff down), and mostly undeveloped wooded lands. Before Jonas Ridge is the Brown Mountain Overlook, where stories of phantom lights on the mountain can be seen from the location. After Jonas Ridge, the highway goes parallel with the Blue Ridge Parkway for a mile before passing over it. In Pineola, the highway overlaps with US 221 for almost before splitting in Linville. The last section of the highway goes by several hills and mountains covered by Fraser firs before entering the Newland city limits and ending at NC 194 (Pineola Street). One unique feature of the highway is the use of mile markers, which only appear between before Brown Mountain Beach Road and Jonas Ridge (mile markers 12-27). An oddity for a two- lane surface road in the state; however, the reason why they exist is simply to assist police and rescue crews to better locate accidents or lost hikers along the curvy section of the highway. A majority of the route shares with either North Carolina Bicycle Route 2 (Mountains to Sea) or North Carolina Bicycle Route 6 (Piedmont Spur). Route 6 is concurrent with NC 181 from its southern terminus in Morganton to Brown Mountain Road and Route 2 is concurrent from Brown Mountain Road to NC 183. Because it mostly overlaps with a state bike route, the road has wider paved shoulders compared to other roads in the area. Because of these extra features, it is not uncommon to find several bikes and motorcycles riding along the highway on any given nice day. NC 181 overlaps with one state scenic byways, the Pisgah Loop Scenic Byway, between Fish Hatchery Road and NC 183. Dedicated and memorial names NC 181 in North Carolina has three dedicated or memorialized sections of highway. * Beatrice Cobb Highway - official name of all NC 181 in both Burke and Avery counties. It is named after Beatrice Cobb (1888‚Äì1959) who started her career early as a teacher and writer. In 1916, she became editor and publisher of the Morganton Herald; in 1922 she was chosen secretary of the North Carolina Press Association by her peers. Eventually her journalism clout in the state became also political clout; she was a Democratic National Committeewoman and an adviser on allocations to federal agencies in the state during the New Deal era. She received numerous awards during her career and an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. * Dr. Mary Martin Sloop Highway - overlapping official North Carolina name of US 221; between Pineola and Linville where NC 181 overlaps. * S B Lacey Jr Highway - overlapping official North Carolina name of NC 181 between Linville and Newland. History The highway was established in 1928 as a new primary routing between NC 18 in Morganton and NC 194 west of Pineola. In 1929, NC 181 was extended southwest to NC 19 in Ruth. In 1930, NC 181 was rerouted north of Pineola to Linville, replacing NC 175, and then west to its current northern terminus at NC 194 in Newland replacing NC 176; its old alignment became part of NC 691. In 1934, NC 181 reached its longest length with an extension southwest to US 176 in Tryon. In 1940, NC 181 was truncated back to Morganton; its former routing was replaced by NC 108 between Tryon and Rutherfordton and US 64A between Ruth and Morganton. In 1977, NC 181 was removed from Avery Avenue and extended along both Sterling Street (southbound) and Green Street (northbound) to its current terminus along Meeting Street, in downtown Morganton. In 1989 or 1990, NC 181 was placed on new bypass route north of Montezuma. In 1991, US 221/NC 181 was removed from Linville Avenue (downgraded to secondary road) and placed on new bypass route west of Linville. North Carolina Highway 176 North Carolina Highway 176 (NC 176) was established around 1928 and traversed from NC 181, in Pineola, north to NC 175, in Linville. In 1930 it was decommissioned in favor of an extension of NC 181\\\\.

It was the first version of what eventually became known as The Tonight Show. Tonight was the first late-night talk show, as well as the first late night television series of any time to achieve long-term success. Allen's run as host of the show lasted for two and a half seasons, beginning in fall 1954 and ending with Allen's departure in January 1957. During its run it originated from the Hudson Theatre in New York City. History Originally a local program airing from 11:20 p.m. to 12 midnight on WNBT New York as The Steve Allen Show, the program was moved to the full NBC network in the Fall of 1954. The first network episode of Tonight aired on September 27, 1954, and ran for 105 minutes instead of the 60-minute duration of modern talk shows (however, the first fifteen minutes were shown on very few stations). The announcer of the show was Gene Rayburn (who would eventually become a top-game show emcee, best known for his 22 years at the helm of the Match Game) and the bandleader was Skitch Henderson. Allen's version of the show originated such talk show staples as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music. The success of the show led to Allen receiving a separate weekly prime time show, which aired on Sunday nights. Allen gave up the Monday and Tuesday shows, with guest hosts taking over for the summer of 1956. Beginning that fall, Ernie Kovacs (who came over from the faltering DuMont Television Network) was the regular Monday and Tuesday host for the 1956‚Äì1957 season with his own cast and regulars, including his own announcer (Bill Wendell; who would later work with David Letterman) and bandleader. A kinescope of the very first episode survives and Allen's opening monologue has been rebroadcast many times on Tonight Show anniversary specials and in documentaries such as Television. In his opening remarks, Allen makes the prescient statement that Tonight! \\"is going to go on forever\\" (an apparent reference to the show's run time, then clocking in at 105 minutes with commercials). With several hosts over the decades, it has done just that, albeit with a much different meaning than Allen intended. Allen and Kovacs' Departure Allen departed Tonight in January 1957 after NBC ordered Allen to concentrate all his efforts on his Sunday night variety program, hoping to combat CBS's The Ed Sullivan Show's dominance of the Sunday night ratings. Kovacs, instead of getting the show five nights a week, was let go, and a radical format change was made (see below). After Allen's prime time show ended in 1960, he would intermittently return to the format he used on Tonight with syndicated programs bearing the name The Steve Allen Show, from 1962‚Äì1964, 1968‚Äì1969, and 1971. Tonight! America After Dark (1957) Rather than continuing with the same format after Allen and Kovacs' departures from Tonight, NBC changed the show's format to a news and features show, similar to that of the network's popular morning program Today. The new show, renamed Tonight! America After Dark, was hosted first by Jack Lescoulie and then by Al \\"Jazzbo\\" Collins, with interviews conducted by Hy Gardner, and music provided by the Lou Stein Trio (later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, then the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet). This new version of the show was unsuccessful, resulting in a significant number of NBC affiliates dropping the show. The format returned to a comedy-oriented talk/variety program on July 29, 1957, with Jack Paar being brought in to host his own version of The Tonight Show.

The battle is named after a local British checkpoint called Danny Boy. Battle The insurgents ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders close to a checkpoint known as Danny Boy near Majar al- Kabir. The Argylls called in reinforcements from the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; the latter were also ambushed and due to an electronic communications failure it was some time before further British relief arrived. While waiting for reinforcements the British were involved in one of the fiercest engagements they fought in Iraq. The fighting involved close-quarter rifle fire and bayonets. The battle lasted for about three hours during which 28 Mahdi Army insurgents were killed; the British suffered some wounded, but none were killed in the action. Aftermath Sergeant Brian Wood, of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle. On 25 November 2009, Bob Ainsworth, then the British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, announced that retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes would chair the Al-Sweady Inquiry. It was alleged that 20 Iraqis, taken prisoner during the battle, were murdered and that others were tortured. The British Ministry of Defence denied that the 20 were captured, stating that 20 bodies were removed from the battlefield for identification and then returned to their families; a further nine were taken prisoner and held for questioning but were not mistreated. In March 2013, Christopher Stanley of the UK-based Rights Watch group said that MoD was trying to get away with grave human rights violations ‚Äì including killing ‚Äì without punishment or due process of law. On 4 March 2013 the hearings of the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry opened in London. On 20 March 2014 Public Interest Lawyers, a British law firm acting for the families of the dead Iraqis, announced that they were withdrawing the allegations against British soldiers. They accepted that there was no evidence that the Iraqis had been alive when taken into the British compound. On 17 December 2014 the inquiry, which cost ¬£31 million, returned its findings. It found that no prisoners had been murdered, nor that their bodies had been mutilated and that the evidence to that effect from the detainees was deliberately untruthful. However, the inquiry did find that British soldiers mistreated nine Iraqi prisoners, but not deliberately. It stated that the ill-treatment was much milder than the initial accusations of torture, mutilation and murder. Sir Thayne said that the \\"most serious allegations\\" which \\"have been hanging over [the British] soldiers for the past 10 years\\" have been found to be \\"without foundation\\". The inquiry found that the allegations made by the Iraqis and their lawyers were based on ‚Äúdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility‚Äù. As a result of the inquiry's findings Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day, another firm involved in cases against British troops, were referred to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority. In August 2016 Public Interest Lawyers went out of business, while the British government announced it would take steps to prevent further spurious claims against troops.Law firm at centre of Al-Sweady inquiry to close down, say reports, The Guardian, 15 Aug 2016 In December 2016 Professor Phil Shiner, head of Public Interest Lawyers, admitted guilt in relation to claims of wrongdoing by British troops in the context of professional misconduct proceedings.

He was a librarian at the British Museum then Librarian of Westminster Abbey from 1974 until his death. Life Howard Millar Nixon was born in Westminster on 3 September 1909 to Leigh Hunter Nixon, a minor canon and precentor of Westminster Abbey, and Harrie Nixon. He accordingly was raised in the Abbey precincts. Nixon was educated at Marlborough College before studying at Keble College, Oxford, where he took a degree in history in 1931. After graduating and finding employment hard to come by, he took up his father's suggestion of working in the Abbey's library, a task that Nixon enjoyed sufficiently to study for a diploma at the School of Library Studies at University College London. In 1936 he began work as a temporary assistant cataloguer at the British Museum; he would eventually rise to the positions of Assistant Keeper in 1946, Deputy Keeper in 1959, and head of rare book collections in 1966. His career was interrupted by war service when he was called up as a major in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. He spent this time visiting anti-aircraft sites across the country, visiting many local libraries in the process. In 1951 Nixon married Enid Bromley with whom he had three sons. Returning to the British Museum, Nixon was involved in setting up a microfilm unit and also developed an interest in bookbinding history, a subject upon which he published extensively. In his obituary, The Times called him the \\"doyen of historians of bookbinding in Britain\\", with a \\"keen eye\\" for detail who had given the subject \\"not merely an academic distinction that it had lacked before but also a basis on which others will build with confidence\\". On retiring from the British Museum, Nixon became Librarian of Westminster Abbey in 1974, and held the post until his death. He was appointed Lecturer in Bibliography at the School of Library Studies at University College London in 1959, holding the post until 1976; he was also Sandars Reader in Bibliography at the University of Cambridge from 1967 to 1968 and Lyell Lecturer in Bibliography at the University of Oxford from 1978 to 1979. Nixon served as president of the Bibliographical Society from 1974 to 1975 and was awarded the society's gold medal in 1978. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1983 and was elected to an Honorary Fellowship of Keble. Nixon died on 18 February 1983.

She served as US Navy auxiliary, IX 65 in World War II and as a postwar research vessel made famous by a Stan Rogers song. Blue Dolphin was designed by the famous naval architect William Roue, designer of the famous racing schooner Bluenose. Sometimes called a sister ship to Bluenose, Blue Dolphin was in fact considerably smaller but reflected the overall style of Bluenose. Blue Dolphin was built for Stephen Henry Velie, Jr of Kansas City. A rich businessman interested in \\"long foreign voyages,\\" Felie ordered a fishing schooner style vessel with an extra reinforced hull but luxurious cabins in place of a fishing hold. She was registered at Shelburne for the beginning of her career which her owner used as a base for adventure trips to the north.\\"The Blue Dolphin\\", The Shelburne Coast Guard, 21 April 1987, p.5 In 1933, Blue Dolphin was purchased by Boston businessman Amory Coolidge (1895‚Äì1952) who transferred her registry to Boston, Massachusetts in 1935.Register of American and Foreign Shipping, 1928 to 1936 Blue Dolphin was designated a miscellaneous auxiliary, IX 65, and acquired by the Navy on 17 March 1942 from Amory Coolidge for the nominal fee of $1.00. She was designated a miscellaneous auxiliary, IX 65 and placed in service at the Section Base, Boston on 6 April 1942. Blue Dolphin spent the next 38 months serving as station vessel at Casco Bay, Maine. Shortly after Germany surrendered, she was placed out of service at Boston on 28 June 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 11 July 1945, and she was delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration for disposal on 14 September 1945. After the war, Blue Dolphin was apparently sold to a Mr. David C. Nutt who was involved in oceanographic research in conjunction with various universities, civilian research organizations, and the Office of Naval Research. Mr. Nutt was also a naval reserve commander. On 3 April 1949, she was designated as \\"suitable for use as a naval auxiliary in time of war\\" by the Chief of Naval Operations. She was also authorized to fly the Naval Reserve Yacht pennant. The last information available on her indicates that she continued to conduct oceanographic and hydrobiological research out of Boothbay Harbor, Maine, into the summer of 1954. While still in Maine, The Blue Dolphin changed hands again. A printer from Detroit named Joe Pica purchased her. Pica had already restored one vessel - the Katherine II - and was looking for a larger ship. He sailed the Blue Dolphin into the Great Lakes where she was berthed in Sarnia, Ontario, for a number of years. That was the last time the Blue Dolphin left the dock under her own power. She sank at the dock in Sarnia at least twice during the restoration efforts. The first time, Pica said the fresh water permeated her okum caulking and when freeze up came it turned to ice. With ice-out, so went the caulking opening up a seam one eighth inch wide by nearly one hundred feet long. With no ship keeper to stem the inflow, she sank. The second sinking Pica attributed to sabotage - unsubstantiated. Journalist and photographer Bruce Kemp became interested in the restoration when he was assigned the story by Sailing Canada Magazine. Because of his affiliation with another magazine at the time, he wrote the final piece under the name of Howard Douglas Jr. Kemp and his wife Donna worked with Pica in trying to set up a foundation, have debts forgiven and to make the ship an ambassador for the city of Sarnia. Kemp also worked on the project as the last in a string of divers and helped raise the ship the second time. He was instrumental in getting folk singer Stan Rogers to agree to aid the project. Rogers commemorated the schooner with his song, \\"Man with Blue Dolphin\\", part of his From Fresh Water album. The liner notes mention that Rogers wrote the song based on his contact with Bruce Kemp and Kemp's experiences trying to raise and restore the Blue Dolphin. Unfortunately, a few weeks after writing the song \\"Man with Blue Dolphin\\" Rogers died in an airplane fire in Cincinnati. When money problems began to plague the ship again, Pica hired a tug to tow the Blue Dolphin over the border into the United States and away from his creditors. He did this without telling any of the people trying to help him. Blue Dolphin spent her final years in Detroit near the Goat Yard Marina. She was last seen by Kemp in 2001. She was lying on her side and partly submerged. On 19 September 2014 Tod Whitfield went to Detroit to have a last look at the Blue Dolphin. Tod had spent many years on the Blue Dolphin in the early seventies, while it was in Sarnia Ontario. The ship is sitting on the bottom, up against the dock in the Goat Yard, in a state well past any thought of being salvageable. On that same trip, Tod was also able to locate Joe Pica, who is living in his antiquated printing shop in downtown Detroit. Joe is 85 now but is still in good shape. He admits that his memory is going but was quite happy to tell yet another old ship story. An obituary shows that Joe Pica died on July 14, 2016.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/joseph-pica-obituary?pid=180679228 On October 9, 2018, Jim Rasor photographed the sunken wreck of the Blue Dolphin in the canal beside the Goat Yard. The water was crystal clear and the wreck is now fully submerged. References * .

It originally aired during late-night. During most of its run it was broadcast from Studio 6B (formerly the home of Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater series) inside the RCA Building (now called the Comcast Building) in New York City. The same studio would also host early episodes of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Its theme song was an instrumental version of \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\", and the closing theme was \\"So Until I See You\\" by Al Lerner. History In July 1957, after the failure of Tonight! America After Dark (a news-oriented program first hosted by Jack Lescoulie and briefly by Al Collins), NBC reverted its late-night show, Tonight, to a talk/variety show format as it had been during Steve Allen's tenure as host. Brought in to host the reformatted Tonight was Jack Paar; Paar was, at the time, working for CBS and hosting the network's The Morning Show, a morning show similar to NBC's The Today Show, before he agreed to jump networks and take over Tonight. Under Paar, most of the NBC affiliates which had dropped the show during the ill-fated run of America After Dark (or who had never picked it up) began airing the show once again. Paar's era began the practice of branding the series after the host, and as such the program, though officially still called Tonight, was marketed as The Jack Paar Show. A combo band conducted by Paar's Army buddy pianist Jos√© Melis filled commercial breaks and backed musical entertainers. When Paar was on vacation, the show was presided over by guest hosts; one of these early hosts was Johnny Carson. Other guest hosts included Jonathan Winters, Orson Bean, as well as the show's announcer, Hugh Downs.http://www.atvaudio.com/ata_category_search.php?current_page=1&category;=TŒ±=Thttp://www.atvaudio.com/ata_category_search.php?current_page=2&category;=TŒ±=T Starting in 1960, it was one of the first regularly scheduled shows to be videotaped in color, with the show recorded very early in the evening and broadcast from 11:15 P.M. to 1 A.M. Eastern time that night. Only a handful of complete Jack Paar \\"Tonight Show\\" episodes exist. All of them are black-and- white kinescope recordings; no color videotapes of any complete Paar \\"Tonight\\" shows are known to exist. Paar hosted the program from 1957 to 1962. Paar's original announcer was actor Franklin Pangborn, but he was fired after only a few weeks for not showing enough \\"spontaneous enthusiasm\\". His replacement was Hugh Downs, who stayed with Paar to the end. At first, the show was called \\"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\\"; after 1959 it was officially known as The Jack Paar Show (or The Jack Paar Tonight Show, a phrasing which led to the name \\"The Tonight Show,\\" as opposed to simply \\"Tonight,\\" being adopted permanently after Paar's departure). On September 19, 1960, the series became one of the first regularly scheduled videotaped programs in color. Only a few minutes of video of Paar's talk host career in color are known to exist today; NBC's policy at the time was to preserve programming on black-and-white kinescopes, but this policy only applied to live or videotaped prime time programming, and as such, the videotapes of most of Paar's Tonight Show appearances were taped over and no longer exist, a policy that continued through the first ten years of Johnny Carson's subsequent hosting of the same series. Senator John F. Kennedy, then a candidate for president, as a Tonight Show guest, 1959. It was during Paar's stint as host that The Tonight Show first became an entertainment juggernaut; Paar generated the most obsessive fascination and curiosity from press and public of anyone who ever hosted the show. Paar strove for compelling conversation as well as humor; his guests tended to be literate raconteurs such as Peter Ustinov or intellectuals such as William F. Buckley, Jr., as opposed to just actors or other performers selling their current work, while Paar himself earned a reputation as a superb storyteller. He also surrounded himself with a memorable group of regulars and semi- regulars, including Cliff Arquette (as the homespun \\"Charley Weaver\\"), author- illustrator Alexander King, Tedi Thurman (NBC's sultry \\"Miss Monitor\\") and comedy actresses Peggy Cass and Dody Goodman. Goodman was a regular from shortly after the show's debut until Paar fired her in 1958; Goodman frequently stepped on Paar's lines and was seen as an uncontrollable upstager.Dody Goodman, 93, television actress, dies. The New York Times (June 24, 2008). Paar's oft repeated expression, I kid you not (something Humphrey Bogart as Capt. Philip Queeg uttered often in The Caine Mutiny), became a national catchphrase. In 1959, Paar's gag writer Jack Douglas became a bestselling author (My Brother Was an Only Child, A Funny Thing Happened to Me on the Way to the Grave: An Autobiography) after his regular appearances with Paar. Douglas' Japanese wife Reiko often appeared, as did Hungarian beauty queen Zsa Zsa Gabor, French comedian Genevieve and several British performers appeared as well; Paar enjoyed conversing with foreigners and knew their accents would spice up the proceedings. Hal Gurnee directed Tonight for much of Paar's tenure as well as the period between Paar's departure and Carson's arrival, when the show was presented by a series of guest hosts. Gurnee went on to direct Paar's prime time The Jack Paar Program and would later direct the David Letterman Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and the Late Show with David Letterman. Controversy In 1959, Paar was criticized for his interview with Cuban leader Fidel Castro; Paar's on-location interview would be the last time any American late-night show would film in Cuba until Conan O'Brien, who himself briefly hosted Tonight, visited the country in 2015 for an episode of his current show, Conan. On December 1, 1959, Paar again made news by asking an apparently inebriated Mickey Rooney to leave the program, remarking \\"It's a shame, he was such a great talent.\\" Rooney and Paar quickly reconciled. In 1961, Paar broadcast his show from Berlin just as the Berlin Wall was going up. Paar also engaged in a number of public feuds, one of them with CBS luminary Ed Sullivan, and another with Walter Winchell. The latter feud \\"effectively ended Winchell's career\\", beginning a shift in power from print to television. Paar famously introduced actress Jayne Mansfield with the line \\"here they are, Jayne Mansfield!\\" (a reference to Mansfield's breasts); the writer of the joke was Dick Cavett, who later went on to host his own show on ABC several years later.Thomas, William (April 10, 2014). The great comeback quip: leave it to the pros. Ellicottville Times. Retrieved April 28, 2014. Highly emotional Paar was often unpredictable and emotional. The most salient example of this kind of on-screen behavior was demonstrated on the February 10, 1960, show, when one of his jokes was cut from a broadcast by studio censors. The joke in question involved a woman writing to a vacation resort and inquiring about the availability of a \\"W.C.\\" The woman used that term to mean \\"water closet\\" (i.e., bathroom), but the gentleman who received the letter misunderstood \\"W.C.\\" to mean \\"wayside chapel\\" (i.e., church). The full text of the joke is: NBC censors replaced that section of the show with news coverage and failed to inform Paar of their decision. On February 11, 1960, Jack Paar quit the show. As he left his desk in the middle of the program, he said: Although Paar had earlier told his announcer Hugh Downs of his intention to quit the show, Downs at first thought Paar was joking. He expected the host to return to the stage,\\"Late Night\\". Pioneers of Television, January 9, 2008. but the abrupt departure left Downs to finish the broadcast himself. While Paar traveled outside the country, his disappearance became a national news event. The entire broadcast of this episode exists on audio tape from WMCT in Memphis. Urged to return to the show by his friend Jonathan Winters, Paar reappeared on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage, struck a pose, and said, \\"As I was saying before I was interrupted...\\" Luis de Le√≥n said something similar on the first day after returning from four years' imprisonment with the words Dicebamus hesterna die (\\"As we were saying yesterday....\\"). After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued, \\"I believe my last words were that there must be a better way of making a living than this. Well, I've looked... and there isn't.\\" That line produced a burst of laughter from the audience. He then went on to explain his departure with typical frankness: \\"Leaving the show was a childish and perhaps emotional thing. I have been guilty of such action in the past and will perhaps be again. I'm totally unable to hide what I feel. It is not an asset in show business, but I shall do the best I can to amuse and entertain you and let other people speak freely, as I have in the past.\\" Paar's departure Jack Paar left the show in March 1962, citing the fact that he could no longer handle the load of putting on an hour and forty-five minute show a night, five nights a week. Over the course of its run, Paar was given more time off so that most Mondays featured a guest host, and all Friday shows were \\"Best Of Paar\\" repeats, giving Paar only three nights of material to fill. To fulfill the rest of his NBC contract after leaving Tonight, Paar hosted a prime-time variety series, The Jack Paar Program and aired weekly, on Friday nights, through 1965. As for Tonight, Johnny Carson was chosen as Paar's successor. At the time, Carson was host of the weekday afternoon quiz show Who Do You Trust? on ABC. Because Carson was under contract to Trust through September (they held him to his contract until the day it expired, prompting him to make occasional wisecracks on Who Do You Trust? about the situation- \\"I'd like to welcome you to ABC...the network with a heart\\"), he could not take over as host until October 1, 1962. The months between Paar and Carson were taken by a series of guest hosts, including Groucho Marx, Jerry Lewis, Jack Carter and Mort Sahl. The show was broadcast under the title The Tonight Show during this interregnum. As the years passed, Carson too became weary of the show's length and struggled to fill so much airtime, so as late local newscasts expanded, Tonight was shortened to 90 minutes, and then to the current 60 minutes after Carson renegotiated his contract in 1980. Carson also arranged for the use of guest hosts and reruns during the week so that he only had to appear three times per week and sometimes during sweeps, four times a week (a practice that has since been abandoned in the Leno, O'Brien and Fallon hosting runs, due to increased competition). Thus, by 1982, Carson had 180 minutes of airtime to fill in a week compared to 525 minutes Paar was filling at the beginning of his run, reducing the work load by nearly two thirds.

The text is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. The text is also titled the Brihadavadhuta Upanishad, Laghuavadhuta Upanishad, and the Avadhutopanishad. The text exists in two parts called major (Brihad) and minor (Laghu). The major part describes the nature and characteristics of an Avadhuta, literally the liberated person, also called a Jivanmukta. The minor part is a short allegorical summary of eight limb Yoga, that the text asserts is part of the Avadhuta lifestyle. History The date or author of Avadhuta Upanishad is unclear, but given its literary style and the texts it references, it is likely a medieval era text. Olivelle and Sprockhoff date it around 14th- to 15th-century. Manuscripts of this text are also found alternatively titled as Avadhutopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 286-287 The text is listed at number 79 in the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman. Contents The text exists in two parts called Brihad-Avadhuta (large or major) and Laghu-Avadhuta (small or minor). The Brihad-avadhuta Upanishad opens with Sannkriti asking Dattatreya, \\"Who is an Avadhuta? What is his state and conduct? Dattatreya appears in several Sannyasa Upanishads including the Avadhuta Upanishad, states Rigopoulos, because he symbolizes the mastery of yoga and the perfectly liberated individual (Avadhuta) in ancient and medieval Hindu texts. Dattatreya replies, asserts the Avadhuta Upanishad, that the word Avadhuta consists of four syllables, each of which come from four concepts. \\"A\\" comes from Akshara (alphabet) or that which is imperishable, \\"Va\\" comes from Varenya or excellent, \\"Dhu\\" comes from Dhuta (shaken off) and Ta comes from Tat or that. Avadhuta, states the Upanishad, is that person who has shaken off the world, is imperishable excellence, with the knowledge of that (Brahman), who is always is driven by his Atman (self, soul) alone, who has transcended discriminating against or for anyone by their varna (class) or stage of life. He lives in bliss, he wanders without care or unconcerned how he looks. His ritual is to make offerings internally in his body, and he condemns all external sacrifices. The Brihad-avadhuta text is notable, states Patrick Olivelle, for referencing and incorporating fragments of or complete hymns from the Bhagavad Gita, Brihat-Sannyasa Upanishad, Pachadasi and other older texts. The incorporated ideas, states Olivelle, include those such as, \\"Avadhuta is always in peace because he never clings or craves for anything\\", and that the liberated man is one who does not care about heavenly afterlife, because he considers all the worlds as his self and his current life is as complete as it can be. The liberated man has done what all there is to do, states the Upanishad, and this Avadhuta continues his journey for the welfare of the world as required by the Vedas, for that is what he wants. Nothing hurts him as he considers himself neither the agent nor affected no matter what happens, he is content that he acts according to his soul. He feels, \\"I am fortunate, I know myself, how wonderful we are, O what knowledge, O what happiness, O what scripture, O what a teacher\\" I have, states the Upanishad. The Laghu-avadhuta Upanishad is the Yoga part of the text. It opens by stating the eight limbs in a manner similar to Patanjali's Yogasutras. Yamas, asserts the text, is the discipline that detaches one from being controlled by one's senses. Niyamas is that behavior that leads to constant attachment to the truth, defines the Upanishad. Asanas is that posture which leads to indifference towards everything in the world. The goal of Yoga is achieving Samadhi, states the text, and it is the state of mental absorption where one is in total oblivion. He thus isolates his soul, he thus separates himself from all delusions in life, and attains the nature of supreme steadfastness. Thus he reaches Kaivalya, asserts the Upanishad.

It is known for historical meetings that took place at the site during the Argentine War of Independence, and was designated a National Monument of Argentina in 1942. History This estate was built during colonial times, and it was used by people traveling between Buenos Aires and the Upper Peru, to rest and acquire new horses, if needed. The original name could have been either \\"Yatasto\\", \\"Ayatasto\\" or \\"Llatasto\\". Don Vicente Toledo y Pimentel inherited and restored it in 1784. As he was a patriot, he supported the insurgent armies that moved to the north, and contributed 1,300 horses and 100 cows to General Juan Ram√≥n Balcarce. The site was also used by patriotic generals to make handovers of command. Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n gave the command of the Army of the North there to Manuel Belgrano on May 26, 1812; Belgrano would later give the command to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n on January 17, 1814, and Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes would make his oath the following month. Currently, only a part of the original building remains. There are stone remains of old rooms and a small church. Current rooms are four rooms at the floor level, and one upper room that may be accessed with wood stairs. It was declared National Historic Monument of Argentina on July 14, 1942, by law N¬∫ 95687. The owners donated it to the state on 1950, and it operates as a museum since then.

Founded in 1907, the Walla Walla Symphony is the \\"oldest continuously operating symphony west of the Mississippi\\".Walla Walla Symphony website The current Music Director and Conductor is Yaacov Bergman, who has held the position since 1987. The Walla Walla Symphony performs most of its concerts at Cordiner Hall located on Whitman College Campus and provides several different types of concerts throughout the year: Symphony Series, Guest Artist Soir√©e Series, Special Concerts, and Family/Youth Concerts. History The Walla Walla Symphony began with the formation of a \\"Symphony Club\\" in June 1907 by a small group who wanted to bring great music to their community. Following the adoption of a constitution and by-laws, the club's board of directors met for the first time on July 1. At a second meeting in September they voted to hire Edgar Fischer to direct an orchestra that would function as a separate entity from the music schools in the community. The first performance of that 29-member group on December 12, 1907 was one of several activities during that season. The club held a series of meetings to study music, presented two more concerts, and sponsored a local performance by the nationally known New York Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Walter Damrosch. While that initial year was an exhilarating success, those that followed would be challenging as the orchestra's founders struggled with finances and often presented concerts to small audiences in less than ideal circumstances. Walla Walla Symphony in 1925 Following the unexpected death of Edgar Fischer at age 49 in 1922, and after two years of interim leadership, Fischer's wife, Alice, a talented pianist and singer, assumed direction of the group. At a time when women conductors were rare, she proved to be an effective and inspiring leader and led the orchestra until it celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1932. Although the Symphony Club, renamed Symphony Society, continued without break as an organization through the Great Depression years, it suspended concerts during the season following the 25th because of financial conditions in the community. After it resumed concerts in 1934, four conductors led the group over the next eleven years, with Walter Wren and Frank Beezhold, both accomplished violinists, each serving 4 years. The orchestra grew and flourished under Beezhold's leadership during the World War II years, because of the location of an Army air force base and military hospital in the community, and a Naval V-12 training program at Whitman College. As the war ended in 1945, Beezhold left to be concertmaster of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Since his departure there have been five conductors. William Bailey, a teacher at Whitman College, followed Beezhold and served for a record 24 years. Jose Rambaldi, his successor, also a Whitman College faculty member, led the orchestra until 1976. Following an interim search year with several conductors, R. Lee Friese became conductor in 1977. With his departure in 1986, Cindy Egolf Sham-Rao conducted during a search year that ended with the selection of Yaacov Bergman, present day conductor, who has conducted more concerts than any previous conductor. Michael Wenberg, who joined the orchestra as a trombone player in 1998, was the orchestra's CEO from 2006 until his retirement in 2011. He became CEO in 2007. Concert Series * Symphony Series concerts are performed at Cordiner Hall, Whitman College Campus and provide music to over 1,000 patrons per concert. These concerts are generally held on Tuesday evenings. * Guest Artist Soir√©e Series concerts feature the solo artists from the corresponding Symphonic concert. These concerts are performed the Saturday before the Symphony concert in a smaller, more intimate setting and include complimentary refreshments as well as the opportunity to meet/interact with the artist. * Special Concerts include full productions of ballets such as the Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, performances in the Tri-Cities, WA, and summer concerts. * Family and Youth Concerts provide the youth of the Walla Walla Valley the opportunity to listen to live, symphonic music. The Walla Walla Symphony performs a Family \\"Foodraiser\\" concert followed by two free Kids' Concerts the next morning for 2,700 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. In 2013 the Symphony doubled Family programming to offer a spring family concert with the Walla Walla Symphony Youth Orchestra side-by-side. The Family Concert is free admission with the donation of one can of food per person (proceeds go to the local food banks). Youth Programs The Walla Walla Symphony sponsors and supports several free youth music education programs that allow children of all ages and backgrounds to participate in music. These programs include: * Encore!

Archaeology After excavating the site, Yosef Garfinkel of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and others believe that Khirbet Qeiyafa is She'arayim. Field work uncovered a wall that makes a nearly complete circuit with two gates. Garfinkel says it is the only contender for She'arayim as all other sites dated to the period have a single city gate. Carbon dating and the absence of pig bones strengthen the argument that Qeiyafa is She'aryaim and not a Canaanite fortress.

It stars Nicolas Cage, Amber Heard, William Fichtner, Billy Burke, Charlotte Ross, Katy Mixon, and Tom Atkins. The film, photographed in 3D, was released on February 25, 2011.  Plot  John Milton (Nicolas Cage), an undead criminal, has escaped Hell and stolen Satan's gun, the Godkiller, to kill Jonah King (Billy Burke). King is a cult leader who killed Milton's daughter and her husband and stole their infant daughter (Milton's granddaughter) to be sacrificed in a Satanist ritual, believing that that will unleash Hell over Earth. After interrogating and murdering some of King's followers in Colorado, Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, an abandoned prison in Louisiana. On his way there he stops by a diner, where he meets Piper (Amber Heard), a waitress. Milton's car was damaged in the pursuit, so he sabotages Piper's car, a 1969 blue Dodge Charger R/T 440, and follows her to fix it in exchange for a ride on the way to Stillwater to find King. Piper walks in on her boyfriend, Frank (Todd Farmer), having sex with another woman. Piper beats the woman and assaults Frank, who then knocks Piper unconscious. Milton, in a phone booth nearby, hears the commotion and comes to Piper's aid, viciously attacking Frank. Milton steals his car, taking Piper with him driving to Stillwater. Meanwhile, a supernatural operative of Satan, The Accountant (William Fichtner), arrives on Earth with the mission to bring Milton back to Hell and take the gun back. After interrogating Frank, he discovers that Milton and Piper are heading to Louisiana, and murders Frank before tricking a pair of state troopers into helping him by impersonating an FBI agent. At a shady hotel, Milton, while having sex with a waitress from a nearby bar, is attacked by King and his men, who heard about his return, but he kills most of them. The Accountant appears with the police and chases after Milton and Piper, who are chasing after King's van. Milton uses the Godkiller to shoot at the Accountant, causing him to drive off a bridge. They then follow King to a church, only to find it filled with King's followers. They are ambushed and captured. Piper is kidnapped and Milton is left for dead, but he awakens and kills King's men before pursuing the RV once again. Inside, Piper breaks free and fights King before jumping out of the RV and onto Milton's car. King then disables the car by repeatedly shooting its engine. Milton and Piper then meet Milton's friend Webster (David Morse), who gives them a new car, 1971 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS. Piper discovers that Milton is undead and had to abandon his daughter to protect her from his former companions, which allowed King to manipulate her into joining his cult before killing her. Webster reveals that Milton died 10 years prior in a shootout and that Webster personally carried his coffin. She also discovers that the Godkiller has the power to completely destroy one's soul, preventing it from going to either Heaven or Hell. Meanwhile, one of King's men who survived Milton's attack tells the Accountant who questions the reason Milton is chasing them. After arming himself, Milton tells Piper and Webster to leave, concerned for their safety, but Piper assures him that she has never had a worthy cause to fight for until now and that she is with him regardless of the consequences. With the help of the now-intrigued Accountant, they evade the troops of Sheriff Cap (Tom Atkins) and arrive at Stillwater. The Accountant captures Piper and forces Milton to give up the Godkiller before he can engage King, but he allows Milton to go into battle against King and his followers to save his granddaughter, noting that Satan is more of a well-educated, calm warden of a very large prison, rather than the face of evil and that he actually despises the sacrifices of innocent lives in his name. While Milton slaughters King's men before they can sacrifice the child, Piper escapes The Accountant's clutches with the Godkiller. King eventually gets the upper hand on Milton and savagely beats him. Piper fires the Godkiller at King, but hits one of his few surviving men instead, knocking herself out. King orders one of his servants to murder the child. However, the woman, who had been caring for the baby ever since King stole her, finds herself unable to carry out the deed, enraging King. The Accountant attracts King's attention, allowing Milton to grab the Godkiller and shoot King, destroying his soul. The Accountant retrieves the baby and allows Milton to say goodbye to her. Milton gives her to Piper, who promises to care for and protect her. Webster arrives and looks on as Milton \\"dies\\". After both Piper and Webster have left, Milton is revealed to still not be fully dead and with the Accountant. Milton makes good on his earlier promise to Webster and drinks a beer from the remains of King's skull. He agrees to return to Hell but threatens to escape again if he is punished too severely. The Accountant claims that he looks forward to it, insinuating that chasing Milton is the most fun he has ever had, before he manifests a black 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air. The two then drive into the gates of Hell.  Cast  * Nicolas Cage as John Milton. He died 10 years prior to the events of the movie, and he returned from Hell to save his granddaughter. He managed to steal Satan's personal gun, the Godkiller, in order to delay the Accountant. He describes Hell as a terrible place; he doesn't mind the pain he is suffering, but rather being forced to watch the video feed of his daughter getting murdered (as the true pain is watching your beloved ones suffer). * Amber Heard as Piper Lee. She is a waitress at a local bar and has a cheating fiancee whom she abandons to join with Milton to save his granddaughter. * William Fichtner as the Accountant. He is Satan's slightly arrogant assistant. He was assigned to return Milton back to Hell, and notes that sometimes he needs to return escaped souls. He has a coin, which he uses to either kill or flips it into an FBI badge as an impersonation. * Billy Burke as Jonah King. He is a ruthless satanist who believes that sacrificing Milton's granddaughter will bring Hell back to Earth and he will be immortal. (The Accountant denies this, saying that Satan himself dislikes satanists.) * David Morse as Webster * Katy Mixon as Norma Jean * Charlotte Ross as Candy * Christa Campbell as Mona Elkins * Pruitt Taylor Vince as Roy * Todd Farmer as Frank Raimi * Tom Atkins as Cap * Jack McGee as Fat Lou  Production  Cage stated that he was originally drawn to the project by a scene in which his character's eyes get shot out. In his previous film, Season of the Witch, he had wanted to have such a scene but producers rejected the idea. The film was shot in 3D, and special effects were created by Gary Tunnicliffe. The cameras were rented from Paradise FX. One reason Cage chose this movie was to be part of the new 3D technology. The three cars driven by Cage in the film are a 1964 Buick Riviera, a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T (440 Engine) and a 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454. Writer/director Patrick Lussier said the Riviera, used at the beginning and the end, \\"was the car we wished we had used the most, because it was a beautiful driving car\\", but \\"It was a shame to smack it up.\\" Three Chargers and three Chevelles were used, with one made very safe for the stunts, and one intended to be shown close to being destroyed. Cage narrated the supernatural film at WonderCon 2010. Patrick Lussier wrote the film with Todd Farmer. Lussier filmed the movie in Minden, Plain Dealing and Shreveport, Louisiana.  Release = Box office  The film was released in the US on February 25, 2011. Footage premiered on July 23, 2010 as part of the San Diego Comic-Con International. It opened at ninth place within the box office rankings at $1.6 million on Friday, with a lower than expected $5 million weekend. Drive Angry box office performance made it the lowest-grossing opening of a 3D film released in over 2,000 US theaters. The film was slightly more successful in international markets, earning $30.3 million.  Home media  Drive Angry was released on DVD, Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray on May 31, 2011.  Critical reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 47% based on reviews from 122 critics, with an average rating of 5.3 out of 10. The website's \\"Critics Consensus\\" for the film says \\"It may deliver the over-the-top action pieces, but Drive Angry prefers to work safely within grindhouse formula than do something truly unique.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 44 out of 100, based on reviews from 21 critics indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on a scale from A to F. James Kendrick called it \\"loud, vicious, tasteless and inane\\". He then went on to say \\"it thunders at you from every direction with a wild abandon that is more irritating and desperate than enlivening\\". Mark Jenkins from the Washington Post commented that \\"Even at its most lurid, though, the movie is a little dull. And it only gets less compelling as the back story fills in.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 and called it \\"an exercise in deliberate vulgarity, gross excess, and the pornography of violence, not to forget garden variety pornography. You get your money's worth.\\" Elizabeth Weitzman from the New York Daily News wrote, \\"Drive Angry is pure grindhouse, so committed to its own junkiness that it is, in its way, a pleasure to behold.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2011 films Category:2010s fantasy action films Category:2010s road movies Category:2011 3D films Category:American action films Category:American films Category:American chase films Category:American exploitation films Category:American action horror films Category:American films about revenge Category:American fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Patrick Lussier Category:Films produced by Michael De Luca Category:Films set in Colorado Category:Films set in Louisiana Category:Films set in Oklahoma Category:Films shot in Louisiana Category:American road movies Category:Summit Entertainment films Category:American vigilante films Category:Nu Image films Category:Saturn Films films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Demons in film Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Films about Satanism Category:Films with screenplays by Todd Farmer ","title":"Drive Angry"},{"id":"26508250","text":"Love at Sea () is a 1964 French film written and directed by Guy Gilles.

An illustration from Fredrik Sander's 1893 Swedish edition of the Poetic Edda In Norse mythology, Sv√°fa or Sv√°va is a valkyrie and the daughter of king Eylimi. Consequently, she was probably the maternal aunt of Sigurd, the dragon slayer, although this is not explicitly mentioned in Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar where Sv√°fa's story appears. Etymology The etymology of the valkyrie's name has been theorized as meaning \\"sleep-maker\\" or as \\"Suebian\\",Peterson, Lena. (2002). Nordiskt runnamnslexikon, at Institutet f√∂r spr√•k och folkminnen, Sweden. and it may not be a coincidence that a king Sv√°fnir and the kingdom Sv√°faland also appears in this poem (it is also mentioned in the √ûi√∞rekssaga), although they are never directly connected with her. Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar The Norwegian king Hj√∂rvar√∞r and Sigrlinn of Sv√°faland had a son who was a silent man and to whom no name could be given. When this silent man had grown up, he was one day sitting on a hill, and he saw nine Valkyries riding of whom Sv√°fa was the most beautiful one. Sv√°fa called him Helgi and asked him if he wanted a gift with his newly-given name (which was customary), but Helgi wanted nothing if he could not have Sv√°fa herself. She then informed him of the location of a great sword engraved with snakes and magic runes. Sv√°fa had given Helgi his name and during his battles, she was always there for him, shielding him from danger. After having won fame in battle, Helgi went to king Eylimi and asked the king for his daughter's hand. King Eylimi consented and so Helgi and Sv√°fa exchanged their vows. Although they were married, she remained with her father while Helgi was out doing battle. King Hr√≥√∞mar's son √Ålfr wanted to avenge his father and had challenged Helgi to a holmgang at Sigarsvoll. During the holmgang with √Ålfr, Helgi received a mortal wound due to a troll woman's curse and √Ålfr won. Helgi then sent his companion Sigarr to king Eylimi in order to fetch Sv√°fa so that they could meet before he died. Before passing away, Helgi asked Sv√°fa to marry his brother He√∞inn. The brother asked Sv√°fa to kiss him, because she would not see him again before Helgi had been avenged. Both Helgi and Sv√°fa would be reborn as Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigr√∫n and so their adventures continued.

The film was directed by Roger Donaldson and produced by Tobey Maguire, Ram Bergman and James D. Stern. Filming took place in New Orleans. The first trailer was released in September 2011. Plot In New Orleans, Will Gerard (Nicolas Cage) is a humble English teacher at Rampart High School. Will's best friend Jimmy (Harold Perrineau) also works at the school. Will's wife Laura (January Jones) is a musician who is in a local orchestra. One night, after a performance, Laura is beaten and brutally raped by a stranger named Hodge (Alex Van). At the hospital, while Will is waiting for news about Laura's condition, Jimmy tells a distraught Will that he is confident that the rapist will be found. A stranger who calls himself Simon (Guy Pearce) tells Will that he represents an organization that deals with criminals the justice system has not. Simon describes his group as \\"a few citizens seeking justice.\\" He says Hodge was paroled three weeks before his attack on Laura, that he has raped other women before, and that he will do it again. Simon proposes an intriguing offer; in exchange for a favor from Will to be determined later, Simon will arrange to have a complete stranger make Hodge pay for Laura's rape. This would spare Will and Laura a drawn-out trial, which would make Laura suffer even more than she already has by repeatedly forcing her to relive the rape, and to be traumatized by defense attorneys. Distraught and grief-stricken, Will consents to the deal. Hodge is killed, and a picture of Hodge's body, along with a necklace that Hodge took from Laura during the rape, are sent to Will as proof. The organization's code phrase is: \\"The hungry rabbit jumps.\\" Six months later, Simon returns. He wants Will to follow a woman and her two children to the zoo and to look out for a man. If Will sees this man, he must call a number attached to a picture. Will agrees, hoping this will fulfill his debt. Simon, however, continues to call Will, asking him to continue what he is doing, claiming the man is a sex offender. Having no choice, as Simon promises to exact revenge if he does not obey, a reluctant Will agrees. He is instructed to kill the man on a pedestrian walkway that is under a high overpass by \\"accidentally\\" bumping him off it to his death, making it look like suicide. Instead of killing the man, Will decides to see if the man has any knowledge of Simon. The man, already paranoid, becomes suspicious that Will is there to kill him. He throws his bicycle at Will. As they struggle, the man falls off the walkway despite Will's efforts to save him. The man lands and is hit by a truck. Will goes home, where Detective Rudeski (Joe Chrest) and Detective Green (Marcus Lyle Brown) arrest him for murdering the man, whose name is Alan Marsh. At the station, Will cannot get Green and Rudeski to believe anything he says. The detectives' boss, Lieutenant Durgan (Xander Berkeley), wants to talk to Will alone. Durgan wants to play a game, asking Will to complete sentences. After a few rounds, Durgan asks, \\"A hungry rabbit...\\" to which Will responds \\"Jumps. A hungry rabbit jumps\\", signifying his connection to Simon's organization. Durgan lets Will go free, giving him 24 hours to get out of the city before Simon and his henchmen Scar (Irone Singleton) and Cancer (Wayne P√©re) come looking for him. Will runs, but he is looking for answers. He goes to a memorial for Alan, and finds out that the man was not a sex offender but actually an award-winning investigative reporter for the New Orleans Post, who was investigating the vigilante organization. Will now knows why Simon wanted Alan dead. Simon, Scar, and Cancer suddenly turn up. Scar chases Will out onto a busy street, but is accidentally killed by an SUV that hits and drags him. Will goes to a storage facility that Alan used and finds a DVD describing some of the people in the group, along with their missions. Will explains what is happening to Laura, who says she would have done the same had their situations been reversed. Will then tells Laura his whereabouts, advising her to stay away from the cops and anyone else who is asking questions. Will learns that Simon's real name is Eugene Cook and that Jimmy joined the organization years ago, after his brother was murdered and the cops were unable to find the killer. Will sends Cook a clip of video by phone, showing that he has the DVD and what it contains. Cook agrees to a trade where Will will receive the security camera footage proving his innocence in Alan's death, as he was acting out of self-defense, in exchange for the DVD. Will agrees, and they agree to meet at the Louisiana Superdome, during a monster truck show. At the dome, Will is told that Laura has been kidnapped and he is shown a photo of Laura gagged with tape as an extra incentive to make him give up the DVD. They go to a nearby mall, abandoned since Hurricane Katrina. Jimmy, Cancer, and a man called Sideburns (Dikran Tulaine) are holding Laura at gunpoint, with her hands tied and duct tape over her mouth. Will gives up the DVD, but Cook reneges on the deal, saying that Will and Laura will both be killed to remove all threats to the organization. He orders them to be shot (only to be distracted by Will branding him an insane hypocrite, Cook enraged by this, rants over how \\"he\\" is at least making a difference compared to apathy of others). Cancer is about to pull the trigger on a bound and tapegagged Laura when he is fatally shot by Jimmy, after which Will forces Sideburns down an inactive escalator, then through the glass at the bottom of the escalator. Sideburns is killed when a chunk of the glass impales his neck. Jimmy says that they did not get into the organization to kill innocent people, with Cook and Jimmy exchanging gunfire, until Cook kills Jimmy with two shots to the chest (mockingly demanding if Jimmy is happy about their predicament). Laura removes the strip of duct tape gagging her mouth and flees with a gun in her hand. Cook catches her and throws her into a glass display case, causing her to drop the gun. Will arrives and begins beating up Cook, but both fall onto another escalator, rolling to the bottom. Laura, who has grabbed the gun that Cook forced her to drop, shoots Cook six times, killing him. Happy to be alive, Will and Laura walk back up the escalator. Durgan arrives, asking who killed Cook. Will responds that it was him, but Durgan says that the way he sees it, the dead guys killed each other. There was no one else present. He goes down to arrange things so the evidence shows this. With the DVD still in hand, Will is cleared of any wrongdoing. He decides to follow up on Alan's work by giving the DVD to Gibbs (Mike Pniewski), a reporter whom Will met at Alan's memorial. Thanking him, Gibbs says, \\"The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?\\" indicating to a surprised Will that Gibbs is also in the organization.

It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard contest, but it was not selected for standardization. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish. Twofish's distinctive features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish borrows some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish has a Feistel structure like DES. Twofish also employs a Maximum Distance Separable matrix. Back in 2000, on most software platforms Twofish was slightly slower than Rijndael (the chosen algorithm for Advanced Encryption Standard) for 128-bit keys, but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys. But after Rijndael was chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard, Twofish has become much slower than Rijndael on the CPUs that support the AES instruction set. Twofish was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson: the \\"extended Twofish team\\" who met to perform further cryptanalysis of Twofish. Other AES contest entrants included Stefan Lucks, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Mike Stay. The Twofish cipher has not been patented, and the reference implementation has been placed in the public domain. As a result, the Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. It is one of a few ciphers included in the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880). However, Twofish has seen less widespread usage than Blowfish, which has been available longer. Cryptanalysis In 1999, Niels Ferguson published an impossible differential attack that breaks six rounds out of 16 of the 256-bit key version using 2256 steps. , the best published cryptanalysis of the Twofish block cipher is a truncated differential cryptanalysis of the full 16-round version. The paper claims that the probability of truncated differentials is 2‚àí57.3 per block and that it will take roughly 251 chosen plaintexts (32 petabytes worth of data) to find a good pair of truncated differentials. Bruce Schneier responded in a 2005 blog entry that this paper did not present a full cryptanalytic attack, but only some hypothesized differential characteristics: \\"But even from a theoretical perspective, Twofish isn't even remotely broken. There have been no extensions to these results since they were published in 2000.\\" See also * Threefish * Advanced Encryption Standard * Data Encryption Standard ReferencesArticles * * External links * Twofish web page, with full specifications, free source code, and other Twofish resources by Bruce Schneier * 256 bit ciphers ‚Äì TWOFISH reference implementation and derived code * Products that Use Twofish by Bruce Schneier * Better algorithm: Rijndael or TwoFish? by sci.crypt * Standard Cryptographic Algorithm Naming: Twofish Category:Feistel ciphers Category:Free ciphers ","title":"Twofish"},{"id":"26508369","text":"The National Leprechaun Museum is a privately owned museum dedicated to Irish folklore and mythology, through the oral tradition of storytelling. It is located on Jervis Street in Dublin, Ireland, since 10 March 2010. It claims to be the first leprechaun museum in the world. The Irish Times has referred to it as the \\"Louvre of leprechauns\\". Tom O'Rahilly designed the museum (with the collaboration of two Italian designers, Elena Micheli and Walter Scipioni) and is its director. O'Rahilly began working on his museum in 2003. He views it as a \\"story-telling\\" tourist attraction designed to give visitors \\"the leprechaun experience\\" and introduce visitors to Ireland's rich storytelling history. Visitors to the museum follow a guided tour involving several different rooms; each serving as sets for the stories and information. The basics of Leprechaun folklore are explained, including what it is that defines a leprechaun. A history of leprechaun references in popular culture is included, such as Walt Disney's visit to Ireland which led to his 1959 film Darby O'Gill and the Little People. There is a tunnel full of optical illusions, a wooden replica of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland and a room where items such as furniture become unusually large to give the effect that the visitor has become smaller in size. References to other creatures are included in the tour such as the p√∫ca, fairies, banshee and many more. At the end of the tour visitors arrive at a shop where they can purchase souvenirs and merchandise.

Its last assignment was with the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group, based at Hammer Field, California. The unit was inactivated on 31 March 1944. The squadron was one of the first dedicated Night Fighter Operational Training Squadron of the Air Force. The squadron trained newly activated night fighter squadrons who were deployed overseas into combat until its inactivation in March 1944 due to a re-alignment of training unit designations.Northrop P-61 Black Widow‚ÄîThe Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. History The squadron was formed in October 1942 from elements of the 81st Fighter Squadron as part of the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) Fighter Command School at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. Its personnel being veteran American pilots trained by the Royal Air Force in night interception operations. It was initially equipped with three Douglas DB-7s and twenty-three Douglas P-70s. Shortages in operational flying aircraft, spare parts and other issues kept flying training very rudimentary for the squadrons first classes that graduated in December 1942. As 1943 progressed additional aircraft and equipment arrived and the program expanded. In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter began to arrive, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow and a few production P-61As. In January 1944 the entire program moved to Hammer Field, California and was placed under IV Fighter Command. The move placed the squadron near Northrop manufacturing facility at Hawthorne, California and most programmed P-61 squadrons were planned for operations in the Pacific and China Burma India Theaters. In March 1944 the 348th was disbanded when the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit during a reorganization of units in the United States. The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to Squadron B of the 450th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Night Fighter Replacement Training Unit).

He seems to have already had a child with a woman in France, both of whom he brought from France to Acadia three years later (1696). His wife, Judith Soubiron, after giving birth in Acadia to two children, Pierre and Jean, died in Port Royal on Oct. 19, 1703, while Baptiste was imprisoned in Boston. Upon his return from Boston, on January 12, 1707, Baptiste remarried, this time a widow, Marguerite Bourgeois, born in Port Royal, the daughter of Jacques Bourgeois, first of the name in Acadia. Baptiste's crew members were primarily Acadians.  King William's War =Battle of Port Royal (1690) During King William's War, Baptiste fought in the Battle of Port Royal (1690). On May 9, 1690 English forces under Sir William Phipps attacked the capital of Acadia of Port Royal with a fleet of seven vessels and 700 men. Baptiste was among only 85 men defending an unfinished fortification at Port Royal.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.28) After spending 12 days pillaging Port Royal, Phipps' troops pillaged the rest of Acadia, including Castine, La H√®ve, Chedabucto and the settlements at the head of the Bay of Fundy. Baptiste was taken prisoner along with other Acadians but shortly after escaped.Clarence d'Entremont. Baptiste the Rascal. Yarmouth Vanguard. March 7, 1989. Upon Baptiste's return to Acadia, Governor Joseph Robineau de Villebon commissioned him to protect Acadian interests as a privateer. Baptiste set off to prey on the busy and dangerous shipping lanes off Boston Harbour. On his first mission, he took eight ships, including a brigantine within sight of Boston.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.30) He received much praise from the Governor of New France Comte de Frontenac. As a result of his success, Baptiste was given command of a fast warship named Bonne. In early June 1694, Baptist arrived at Cape Sable and scattered the New England fishing fleet, taking five vessels into Fort JemsegAfter the Battle of Port Royal (1690), governor of Acadia, Joseph Robineau de Villebon moved the capital of Acadia from Port Royal to Fort Nashwaak (also known as Fort St. Joseph) at present day Fredericton, New Brunswick (1692). Initially the Capital was moved from Port Royal to Jemseg, New Brunswick at Fort Jemseg (1690) before moving to Fredericton the following year. on the Saint John River.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.3) He followed up this initiative in July 1694 by returning to Boston and sank a few vessels that were too small to be worthwhile prizes, while capturing three that were. In 1694, over a three-month period, he captured 10 vessels. Six months later, January 1695, he returned to Saint John River with more prizes that he had captured. Fear of Baptiste is reported to have kept 400 New England fishing vessels tied up guarding their coasts.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.32) All the English settlers fled from coastal Maine to safety further south. On May 24, 1695, returning from Boston with more prizes, Baptiste ran into an English war ship. Baptiste ran his vessel aground and fought. Cannon fire raged throughout the day, the English ship was crippling Bonne. Having lost the ship Bonne, Baptiste went ashore and walked to Villebon at Fort Nashwaak on the Saint John River.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.32-33)  Battle at Baie des Espagnols (1695) May 1695, Baptiste came across an English frigate at Baie des Espagnols (Sydney, Cape Breton) and immediately engaged it in battle. The English frigate overwhelmed Baptiste's vessel forcing him to run it aground and then abandon it.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979. p. 161.  Raid on Pemaquid (1696) In the summer of 1696, Baptiste led Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville's expedition out of Acadia to attack strongholds on the New England coast. After having captured two frigates at the mouth of the Saint John River, the first target was the vitally important port at Pemaquid (present day Bristol, Maine). The port was protected by Fort William Henry (also known as Fort Pemaquid).(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.33) Baptiste and the expedition soundly destroyed the fort and dismantled it. Acadia became a source of torment for the settlers of New England.  Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696) Within weeks of the attack on Pemaquid, the New Englanders struck back. In 1696 an expedition under command of Colonel John Hathorn and accompanied by Major Benjamin Church set out to destroy the capital of Acadia Fort Nashwaak (present day Fredericton, New Brunswick; See Fort Nashwaak), then Acadia's capital. Villebon had been alerted and prepared his defences. On October 18 the New England troops arrived opposite the fort, landed three cannons and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River.near where the Fort Nashwaak Motel now stands Baptiste was there to defend the capital.For details on the Siege see Beamish Murdoch, pp. 228-231 Baptiste joined the Indians and put himself at their head for the duration of the siege. There was a fierce exchange of fire for two days, with the advantage going to the better sited French guns. The New Englanders were defeated, having suffered 8 killed and 17 wounded. The French lost one killed and two wounded.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.34) Raid on Casco Bay, Maine (1697) By withdrawing from the Siege of Fort Nashwaak, the British gave up two small boats. Baptiste used them to head to Grand Pre. While in Grand Pr√© he armed the vessels and recruited Acadian crew members to make a descent on the coast of New England. In March 1697 Baptiste had captured eight English fishing vessels within three leagues of Casco Bay.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.35) Bapiste was injured three times in the raid, however, he was able to capture the vessels and took many prisoners. Two New England privateer ships arrived at the scene but Baptiste was able to beat them back and safely return to Grand Pr√© with his prizes.(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.35) In May 1697, Villebon again sent Baptiste to raid the New England ports. For a second time Baptiste was captured and imprisoned in Boston for over a year. Despite the official end of King William's War with the Treaty of Ryswick, the New Englanders were reluctant to release Baptiste. The European war ended in 1697 with the Treaty of Ryswick, but continued in New England for two more years. Upon his release, in December 1698, Baptiste returned to Port Royal. Villebon made him captain of a small coast guard vessel and captain of the Port Royal militia.Murdoch, (p. 243) Baptiste was protecting Acadian fishing interests off of Acadia when he was captured in 1702 and again imprisoned in Boston on the eve of Queen Anne's War.  Queen Anne's War  During Queen Anne's War, Queen Anne is reported to have ordered that no prisoners were to be exchanged and that Baptiste was to be hanged, because he was an officer of the garrison of Port Royal who had been made prisoner during peacetime, and who had then failed to recover his freedom, on the ground of his being a pirate. On hearing this, Governor of Plaisance (Placentia), Newfoundland Jacques-Fran√ßois de Monbeton de Brouillan sent an express messenger to Boston, to declare to the governor that he would retaliate if Baptiste was killed. This saved Baptiste's life.Murdoch, p.255 Baptiste was kept in strict seclusion on Boston's Castle Island until 1706.Murdoch, p. 279 New France and Acadia made significant diplomatic efforts to get him back, insisting that he be released as part of a prisoner exchange involving captives taken by French and Indian raiders in the 1704 Raid on Deerfield. Difficulties in obtaining Baptiste's release also lead to the delay in the return of another prominent prisoner, Acadian No√´l Doiron. Siege of Port Royal (1707) Baptiste eventually returned to Acadia in 1706 and for the rest of Queen Anne's War served as port captain of the Acadian settlement of Beaubassin. He is reported to have served with distinction in the first Siege of Port Royal (1707). He sailed along the coast between Port Royal and to the French capital of Newfoundland Plaisance (present day Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador). In 1709 and 1711 he participated in the arming of privateers at Plaisance.(Roger Marsters. 2004. p.36) Because of his immense knowledge of the North Atlantic coasts, the Governor of Plaisance, Philippe Pastour de Costebelle consulted Baptiste on the site for the new settlement on Cape Breton Island, Louisbourg (1714).(Roger Marsters. 2004.p.36)  See also  *Military history of Nova Scotia *Francois Guion References ;Endnotes ;Secondary Sources * * Roger Marsters. 2004. \\"[Baptiste:] A Corsiar on the Border.\\" Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast. pp. 25‚Äì36 * \\"Baptiste was said to have a wife in every port\\" Yarmouth Vanguard, March 14, 1989 * * John Clarence Webster.

The games are targeted at ages 8 years and older, and may be downloaded to Windows or Macintosh systems.Reeks, Anne (December 26, 2006). \\"More to the story than 3 quick games\\", Houston Chronicle, p. 4. The games are focused on the evolution of a prototype bathroom cleaner, \\"Grey Goo\\". The levels follow the Grey Goo as it advances from eating dirt particles to bugs and leaves, and then eventually the rest of the universe. The game is arcade in style and has both a casual mode, where players can play for leisure without a timer and the full game which is timed and must be completed before the time runs out to complete the level. In the original Tasty Planet game, there are also 3 bonus levels called Endurance levels, which are long, and can take up to an hour to complete each. A second game, Tasty Planet Back For Seconds, was released in 2010. A spinoff game, Tasty Blue, was released in 2014. A third game, Tasty Planet Forever, was released in 2018.http://www.dingogames.com/tasty-planet-forever/ Tasty Planet (2006) Tasty Planet was the original game in the series, released in August 2006. Plot The plot is shown solely through comic strips at the end of some levels. The first comic strip shows a scientist telling his assistant about his latest discovery, the Grey Goo bathroom cleaner. They place it under a microscope, and the first level of the game begins. After the first two levels of the game, the assistant touches the Grey Goo, who bites him and enters his body. The scientist tells his assistant \\"Just go and wash your hands.\\" The Grey Goo is then washed down the drain and lands outside, where it moves to a park and grows in size. It then moves on to a picnic table where the scientist and assistant are having lunch. When they discover it, the pair throw the Grey Goo into the ocean. The Grey Goo then eats through the ocean and is launched by a whale into another park and then to a city. There, the Grey Goo faces its first war from humans, who attempt to use guns, tanks, etc. to stop it. It eventually launches itself into the sky and then into orbit around Earth. After eating the moon, Earth, and the rest of the solar system (including Pluto), it moves on to nearby stars like Alpha Centauri and beyond the Milky Way. However, its mass becomes too great after devouring the fabric of space and time, and it implodes thus causing the universe to begin again. Levels Tasty Planet is split up into 9 chapters, each containing a depending number of levels. They are listed in increasing size order as the Grey Goo grows. They are Labs, Outside, Picnic, Ocean, Park, City, Sky, Orbit and Cosmos. An additional option selectable from the main menu is the Endurance mode. These are variations on 3 existing levels. The only change is that the player grows extremely slowly, and it can take over an hour to beat one of these levels. They are considered the most difficult part of the game. Tasty Planet: Back For Seconds (2010) Tasty Planet: Back for Seconds, the second part of the franchise, was released in September 2010. Plot Just like in the original Tasty Planet game, the plot is shown solely through comic strips at the beginning or end of some levels. The first comic strip shows a scientist telling his assistant about his new time machine, and also mentioning an accidental discovery, a grey goo blob that is sitting under a beaker. The assistant thinks the blob looks hungry and gives it some candy. The blob eats the candy, then the scientific apparatus on the table, followed by rats, then cats, then larger apparatuses, until it is big enough to consume the time machine itself, which makes it travel back in time 65 million years. The Grey Goo starts small again in the late Cretaceous period, consuming the plants and animals of the area, before consuming a volcano and being hit by a meteor, which prevents the dinosaurs from going extinct. In the present, the scientist and the assistant experience changes in the timeline as they happen in the past. After being hit by the meteor, the grey goo travels through time again, but each time it travels through time it reverts to a small size. It then travels to Egypt, and consumes snakes, mummies, cats, people, buildings, and the pyramids. Next, it travels to Ancient Rome, where it consumes a feast, people, then buildings and destroys the city, forcing the Romans to pull together and prevent the fall of the empire. Next, it travels to Feudal Japan, where it eats rice, ninja, and buildings, but also consumes Monsterzilla, removing the world's protection from giant monsters and allowing them to ravage the present. The scientist by this point has figured out that the grey goo has only one jump left, this time to their future, and they must be prepared for it, so he and his assistant preserve their brains so they can survive until the grey goo appears. When it does, far in the future, it is microscopic instead of a few centimeters in diameter as when it usually jumps, but the scientist has prepared tiny robots to destroy the grey goo while it is still small. However, it evades the bots and grows larger, necessitating the scientist's second line of defense: energy weapons grafted onto ants, rats, and cats. It evades those too, growing large enough to consume the scientist and his assistants' brains. Giant humanoid tanks armed with powerful lasers are dispatched to destroy the goo, now several meters in diameter, but it evades the blasts, consumes future technology, people, and cars, and destroys the tanks too, destroying the city. Next, it launches into space, grows on small asteroids, destroys humanity's last line of defense - armed circular satellites that measure roughly 120 kilometers in diameter - then moves on to destroy Earth, the moon, and the planets (excluding Pluto as it is too small compared to the gas giants). Next, the grey goo consumes small stars around the sun, then the sun itself, working up to red giants. The goo eats the largest stars (red hypergiants); though one of them undergoes a hypernova leaving a black hole, the goo consumes the black hole as well. The goo continues to consume nebulae, star clusters, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Ripping through the fabric of time, it eats said fabric and discovers that the space-time continuum is resting on the back of a turtle, which is on the back of a slightly larger turtle, and that it's turtles all the way down. It then eats the turtles until they are gone, but since the turtles are infinite, the goo's feast is never-ending, then the game is over. Levels Tasty Planet: Back For Seconds is split up into 6 chapters, further split into 48 levels. They are listed largely related to the story, but many of the levels are separate challenges unrelated to the growth of the grey goo, such as a level where the goo must eat hippopotamus babies but avoid the adults until it is large enough. # Modern Era (4 Levels) # Cretaceous Era (7 Levels) # Egyptian Era (11 Levels) # Ancient Rome (8 Levels) # Feudal Japan (7 Levels) # Far Future (10 Levels) Tasty Planet Forever (2018) Tasty Planet Forever is the third game in the franchise, and was released in 2018. It has more than eight playable characters and well over 150 levels. PlotParisian Cat= The game begins in Paris, France. Two chefs, which resemble the original scientist and his assistant from the two original games, think that the kitchen is dirty; the older chef informs his assistant of a robotic cat gifted to him by his cousin. They order their robotic cat to consume peas, cockroaches, mice, wine bottles, knives, and croissants on the floor. However, it did not stop and it continued to eat more. After eating waiters, customers, and more people, it started to consume trees, cars, buildings, the Eiffel Tower, and eventually all of Paris. =Caribbean Octopus= An infant octopus in the Caribbean Sea is sleeping, only to be awoken by an aluminum can that hits its head. It swims to the surface of the sea and, much to its dismay finds that a city resort on an island has produced a large pile of waste. The octopus starts to eat rubbish, causing it to become larger and consume the waste-producing island resort. =African Rat= In Africa, a foreign stray rat appears among other rats trained to eat old land mines to prevent the deaths of endangered animals. The rat begins to eat inhabitants and fauna of the Sahara Desert, along with safari vans, resorts, and planes. =Big City Bee= To prevent the collapse of endangered bee colonies, a genetically engineered bee is kept in a test tube to be tested. During an interview, a man walks by and observes the bee. Shocked with the size of its eyes, the man aggressively snaps the test tube, causing the bee to eat nectar at first, but grows in size and eats gnats, apples, drones, then whole humans, trees, aircraft, buildings, hills, mountains, and islands. Finally, the bee consumes the continents, the Moon, and Earth. =Pacific Basking Shark= In an alternate timeline, a man in charge of a large fishing business boasts about having killed all basking sharks in the Pacific Ocean when the year is 1956. However, one off the coast of British Columbia begins to consume other fish, scuba divers, and eventually log cabins. =Australian Dingo= In the Australian Outback, a stray dingo trained to eat invasive species begins to consumes humans and eventually the entire landscape, including tractors, houses, and crops. =Cyberpunk Penguin= In the future, most of the ice on Earth has melted, resulting in a sea level rise. A group of penguins has been confined to a barren island, while most of humanity has built a floating island in the highly polluted atmosphere. A mutation occurs within the commune of penguins, giving it wings that it uses to fly to one of the artificial floating cities. It begins small by eating first french fries, meat snacks, moths, and butterflies, before consuming air conditioning systems, buildings, futuristic flying vehicles, and entire floating cities. =Martian Grey Goo= In 2057, the first humans are finally able to land on Mars. However, one of the crew members reports observing \\"anomalies\\" in the ice samples he had brought with him. The \\"anomalies\\" turn out to be from a grey goo frozen in the ice, which is subatomic in size. The goo begins to eat quarks, hadrons, atoms, before growing in size to eat the crew members, their robotic canines, and their settlements on Mars. After consuming all of the human bases, the goo consumes the surface features of Mars (such as the planet's ice caps) before consuming the entire planet and the seven other planets in the Solar System (including Earth and excluding Pluto). It then moves up in scale to eat the Sun, M-type, K-type stars and yellow dwarfs, T Tauri stars, nebulae, \\"Space Manta Rays\\", the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group, a \\"Noodly Monster\\", and eventually the observable universe. The universe, however, turns out to be nothing but a quark in a much larger universe, with other parallel universes being other quarks in the larger universe. Objective The main objective of the games is to get to the size specified by the level. This is done by eating entities that are smaller than the Grey Goo, and avoiding those that would harm it, such as white blood cells, bacteria and samurai. However, touching a damaging item only removes a small bit of matter for the grey goo, and there's a limit on how much is removed, so on Casual mode, it's impossible to lose the game. Also, the vast majority of the harmful objects ignore the grey goo, only a few actively pursue it, and nothing in the game can move faster than the grey goo, except for certain bonus levels where the goal is to grow larger than a computer-controlled grey goo. The level is complete when the Grey Goo has reached the required size or otherwise fulfilled the stage requirements (such as, perhaps, eating a set number of eggs or mummies).

He came to prominence through his involvement in the purchase and sale of the famous stamps firm Stanley Gibbons which he sold at a great profit, only to see most of the proceeds lost following trading difficulties. Before this Fraser had a background in accountancy, mail-order, retailing and property development.  Plastic Wax  In 1976 Fraser became a partner in Plastic Wax, a company in Bristol which specialised in collectible records and still exists. In 1978 the firm started to offer music memorabilia and this became the collectibles firm Fraser's Autographs. Ultimately, Fraser's Autographs became part of Stanley Gibbons in 1996.  Stanley Gibbons  Fraser first invested in Stanley Gibbons in 1989 when he acquired a large block of shares in the company from Clive Feigenbaum.\\"Newsdesk: Stanley Gibbons Share Deal\\" in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, October 1989, p. 9. He purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector. In 1990 he was appointed Executive Chairman of the firm. By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.  Flying Flowers  In June 1998, Stanley Gibbons was sold for ¬£13.5 million to Flying Flowers. In the deal Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and he was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the transaction. The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Fraser's stake was reduced in value from ¬£13.5 million to ¬£4 million. The demerged Stanley Gibbons became Communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal \\"...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time.\\" In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman of Stanley Gibbons and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles.

The metal-bonded diamond tool can be a metal-bonded diamond blade, a diamond grinding cup wheel, a diamond core drill bit, a diamond gang saw blade, etc. The diamonds of a metal-bonded diamond tool are all in the tool's diamond segments to play their role of cutting or grinding. Structure Diamond segments consist of small-size diamonds and metal bond materials. The metal bond materials may include the powders of Cu, Sn, Fe, Ag, Co, Ni, WC, Mo, graphite, etc. The diamonds are mixed with the bond materials, and the mixture is loaded into molds. After hot pressing or cold pressing, sintering, and arc grinding, diamond segments are formed. The metal bond has two basic functions: One is bonding the diamonds to the body of the tool; the other is wearing along with the diamonds' wearing to let the new sharp diamonds be exposed properly. Generally, a diamond segment has a working layer and a transition layer. The working layer contains diamond grains for cutting or grinding, while the transition layer has no diamonds. It just consists of bond materials, and is used to connect the working layer to the body of the diamond tool. The transition layer is necessary for diamond segments used on laser- welded diamond tools. The compositions of the two layers should not be very different. Otherwise, the junction of them will tend to break because of the uneven heat and forces received by the two layers when the diamond tool is in use. The diamond segments used on large diamond circular saw blades or diamond gang saws for cutting stones can be layered and have some non-working layers separating the working layers. The working layers contain the common materials of diamond segments, including diamonds and metal bonding materials, while the non-working layers are usually made of metal powders. This design can increase the sharpness of the diamond segment, and lower its production cost. Forms Diamond segments may come in various forms on diamond tools. For a diamond blade, diamond segments are just the \\"teeth\\" of the blade. The form of the segments is an important factor which influences the performance of the blade, for example, the blade's cutting efficiency and the ratio of the diamonds' non-normal failure. The form of diamond blades' diamond segments may be convex, layered sandwich concave, L-shaped, step-shaped, segmented, side- slotted, etc. There are mainly two purposes to make these forms: one is to increase the blade's capabilities of containing and discharging sawdust, and improve the cooling and lubricating conditions. The other is to reduce the friction between the segments and the material being cut as well as the sawdust, improve the blade's cutting capability, and thus save energy and improve the blade's performance. The diamond segments of diamond grinding cup wheels also have many different forms to fit different grinding applications. Use The features of the diamond segments on a diamond tool should match the nature of the material to be cut. If the material is hard, the bond of the diamond segments should be softer. Because diamonds are apt to become blunt when cutting hard material. The softer bond can be worn down with the blunt diamonds faster, and then make new diamonds beneath be more easily exposed to participate in cutting. If the material is relatively softer, the bond should be harder. For in this case diamonds can last longer. The harder bond wears slower, so that it can hold the diamonds also longer. This can make better use of the diamonds and prolong the diamond tool's service life. The grit (size), hardness and concentration of the diamonds in the diamond segments should also be considered. For example, when the material to be cut is soft, the diamonds' size can be big, hardness can be medium, and concentration should be a little bit higher. This combination can get good cutting efficiency, and at the same time prolong the blade's life. When the material is hard, the diamonds' size should be small, hardness should be high, and concentration can be a little bit lower.

The species is known from the holotype, number \\"KU-DR-023\\", a single female specimen currently deposited in the University of Kansas Natural History Museum collections in Lawrence, Kansas, where it was studied and described by Michael S. Engel. Engel published his 2009 type description for T. mitnicki in journal ZooKeys volume number 25. The species name mitnicki honors Tyler Mitnick, nephew of the specimen donor. T. mitnicki is the third species of Termitaradus to be identified from the fossil record and the one of three species identified from Dominican amber, the other two being T. avitinquilinus, described earlier in 2009 and T. dominicanus described in 2011. The eight living species are found worldwide in the tropical regions of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is probable that T. mitnicki, like modern species of Termitaradus, was inquiline, living in the nests of host species of termites, though the host species is unknown. Modern species of Termitaradus, where the host termite is known, live with members of the family Rhinotermitidae, however a possible host of T. avitinquilinus is the extinct termite Mastotermes electrodominicus, the type specimens being preserved associated with a worker M. electrodominicana. While modern Termitaradus species are small, being an average of , T. mitnicki is the third largest species known at 5.8 mm long. The second largest is T. dominicanus at and the largest species is the Miocene Mexican amber species T. protera with a length of . Typical of Termitaradus, T. mitnicki is flattened with laminae extending out from each body segment, giving a round, scale-like appearance confirming the genus placement. The other genus in Termataphididae, Termitaphis, has an egg-shaped body rather than the flattened body of Termitaradus species. T. mitnicki can be identified from other species through several characteristics, notably the distinctive network of ridges on the top of the insect, which do not extend to the edges of the laminae. The general coloration is reddish-brown, lightening as towards the edges of the laminae with pale yellow setae.

John Jeffries Burial Marker is an historic burial monument in the cemetery at Scullville Bible Church in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, along County Route 559 near Somers Point. It was built in 1887 and added to both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Capt. Jeffries (1829-1887) is known for his association with the ship Twenty One Friends, which, following an incident at sea, floated without crew across the Atlantic Ocean for two years before being claimed and returned to service. The Monument Inscription on Capt. John Jeffries Burial Marker featuring the schooner ‚ÄúTwenty One Friends‚Äù. The Capt. John Jeffries burial marker is approximately tall and the largest marker in the Scullville Bible Church cemetery. The church was built in 1866 and, at the time of his death, was named Palestine Bible Protestant Church. The monument is made of marble and stands on a square brick base approximately on each side. It is located in the Jeffries family plot behind the church, surrounded by other local-area family plots, many of which also date back to the 19th century. The square center section features an inscription, and above that a bas-relief engraving of the ship associated with Jeffries‚Äîand the source of his historical fame‚Äîthe Twenty One Friends. Another smaller section above bears the initials ‚ÄúJ.J.‚Äù and a draped urn is carved at the top of the monument. The center inscription reads: Capt. John Jeffries. Born Nov. 15, 1829. Died March 17th 1887. A member of the K. of P. The Jeffries of Great Egg Harbor The Jeffries family can trace its genealogy back to 18th-century European settlers of Rhode Island. cited in John Jeffries Sr. (1735-1810) from Egg Harbor earned a pension for his service during the American Revolutionary War. The family owned land where Patcong Creek empties into Great Egg Harbor River, and it was here they built a two-storey plantation house. The area became known as Jeffries Landing and was an active port as well as later becoming a popular destination area for bathers. The settlement that formed inland, north of Jeffries Landing, came to be called Jeffers, also named after the family. In the early 1900s, Jeffers was renamed Scullville, honoring a different family, the Sculls. Currently, where Patcong Creek meets Great Egg Harbor River is still called Jeffries Landing. John Sr. and his wife, Judiah, had three sons, one of whom was John Jeffries Jr. (1789-1834). In 1819 John Jeffries Jr. was named wharf master at Jeffries Landing, responsible for collecting the wharfage of 30 cents per day to dock there. In 1829, John Jr.‚Äôs wife, Isabell, gave birth to John III (1829-1887), who would grow up to become a sea captain. Capt. John Jeffries III later lived along English Creek, upstream from Jeffries Landing along the Great Egg Harbor River. He was married to Hannah Barrett Jeffries. Variations of the name The family name can be seen spelled different ways; Jeffries, Jeffryes, Jeffrys and Jeffers appear with interchangeability although all reasonably refer to the same family. Some evidence of this can be found within the penned family plot in Scullville (Palestine) Bible Church cemetery. On one side of the Captain, his wife Hannah ‚ÄúJeffers‚Äù is buried and on the other side, his young son Samuel J. ‚ÄúJeffers‚Äù. In between stands the monument to Capt. John ‚ÄúJeffries‚Äù. Shipbuilding along Great Egg Harbor River The banks of Great Egg Harbor River, from Mays Landing to Somers Point, were an ideal environment for shipbuilding in the century following the American Revolutionary War due to natural resources in the area. These resources included lumber from pine, oak, and cedar as well as bog ore. The waterways were deep enough for ships up to 2000 tons (1,800 MT). Sawmills and blast furnaces were available in the area. What was not used to build ships was exported in their holds. One shipwright during this time was Capt. Samuel Gaskill of Mays Landing. The Twenty One Friends In 1872, Capt. Gaskill built a three-masted (tern) schooner for Capt. Jeffries. The ship was financed by a group of 21 Philadelphia Quakers and consequently named the Twenty One Friends. In 1885, returning to Philadelphia with a full load of lumber from Brunswick, Georgia, the Twenty One Friends was rammed by the John D. May off the coast of Cape Hatteras. Capt. Jeffries removed his crew and abandoned the vessel. The ship and cargo were left to the mercy of the sea. Capt. Jeffries‚Äô concern for the safety of his men was appropriate; however, the Gaskill-made ship proved itself to be more seaworthy than expected. After the collision, the ghost ship was sighted on both sides of the Atlantic over the next two years. It finally came ashore in Ireland, where its cargo was salvaged and it was employed as a fishing vessel. The Twenty One Friends remained in service until 1914. Historical significance The Jeffries monument represents not only the life of a sea captain from the Great Egg Harbor River, but also an industry along that river during the 19th century. There are few remaining relics from the marine and shipbuilding industries that mark this region's history during that time. In addition, the monument has been singled out for its intricate carvings, which helped achieve its NRHP status.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is the second greatest cause of death in children 5 years and younger. Diarrheal disease takes the lives of 525,000 or more children per year. Diarrhea is characterized as the condition of passing of three or more loose or watery bowel movements within a day sometimes with undigested food visible. Diarrhea is separated into three clinical categories; acute diarrhea may last multiple hours or days, acute bloody diarrhea, also known as dysentery, and finally, chronic or persistent diarrhea which lasts 2-4 weeks or more. There is normal growth with no evidence of malnutrition in the child experiencing persistent diarrhea. In chronic diarrhea there is no evidence of blood in the stool and there is no sign of infection. The condition may be related to irritable bowel syndrome. There are various tests that can be performed to rule out other causes of diarrhea that don't fall under the chronic criteria, including blood test, colonoscopy, and even genetic testing. Most acute or severe cases of diarrhea have treatment guidelines revolving around prescription or non prescription (also known as over the counter or OTC) medications based on the cause, but the treatment protocols for chronic diarrhea focus on replenishing the body with lost fluids and electrolytes, because there typically isn't a treatable cause.  Signs and Symptoms  Toddler's diarrhea is characterized by three or more watery stools per day that persist for 2-4 weeks or more. Newborns and infants may normally have soft and frequent stools; however, any noticeable changes in stool frequency or form (i.e. watery) can indicate toddler's diarrhea. Other symptoms may include chills, fever, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, and/or vomiting. Undigested food and/or mucus may also be observed in stools. More serious symptoms may include bloody stools, weight loss, greasy stools, and/or severe abdominal pain. Aside from these signs and symptoms, infants and children present as healthy individuals with appropriate weight gain (considering sufficient calorie intake), active lifestyles, and normal appetites.  Complications  Possible complications associated with toddler's diarrhea include malabsorption and dehydration. Malabsorption affects the small intestine and results in the impaired absorption of important nutrients from an infant or child's diet, leading to malnutrition. Malabsorption is indicated by symptoms of bloating, appetite changes, weight loss, and/or gas. Dehydration occurs when there is not enough fluid intake to compensate for increased loss of fluid and electrolytes that may result from chronic diarrhea. Dehydration is indicated by symptoms of thirst, absence of tears when crying, infrequent urination, dry mouth, and/or decreased energy. Cause Diarrhea happens when the amount of fluids absorbed in the intestine does not match the amount secreted. The imbalance can be achieved in two ways: an excess of secretion or a lack of absorption. Thus, diarrhea can be categorized into secretory diarrhea, an excess of secretion, or osmotic diarrhea which is a lack of absorption. Usually both categories are present in chronic diarrhea of infants. Secretory diarrhea can be caused by either infectious or non-infectious agents. Infectious agents include bacteria, viruses, and protozoans while non-infectious agents can be hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and others. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when nutrients that are not absorbed exists in the intestines, typically due to damage to the intestines. The nutrients that are unable to be absorbed in the intestines draws water to itself. Some factors that lead to chronic diarrhea of infancy: * Underdeveloped digestive system, nutrients do not spend adequate time in the digestive tract for water to be absorbed which leads to diarrhea. * Imbalanced Diet - a diet that has excess fiber and/or a lack of fat, fat can slow down the digestion process and prolong the amount of time nutrients spend in the tract which increases absorption. Fiber can lead to diarrhea because it shortens the amount of time food spends in the intestines, decreasing absorption. * Inability to absorb carbohydrates The specific source of chronic diarrhea typically depends on the age of the infant/child. Diarrhea is uncommon for newborns; consequently, its presence in newborns could indicate a congenital disorder which would need hospitalization. Rare causes of chronic diarrhea in young children include a group of genetic mutations known as \\"congenital diarrhea and enteropathies\\" (CODEs). This group of genetic disorders usually presents in the first weeks of birth as severe and debilitating diarrhea and can lead to malabsorption, growth failure, and difficulty feeding. CODEs are rare genetic changes to a single gene that affects the lining of the intestine or changes to the immune system that also affects the cell function of important nutrient and electrolyte transporters in the intestine such as Cl-/HCO3- mutation. Otherwise, socioeconomic factors and access to treatment/healthcare play a significant part in developing chronic diarrhea as an infant. For instance, leading causes of chronic diarrhea in developing countries are infections of the intestine. In developed countries, chronic diarrhea has a diverse range of causes such as chronic infection of the intestines, autoimmune enteropathy, and inability to absorb nutrients via celiac disease, food sensitivities, etc. From age 0-30 days, typical causes are: * Abetalipoproteinemia, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that creates abnormal absorption of fats and some vitamins. * Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc. * Autoimmune enteropathy, a rare condition in which the intestines are perceived as a foreign threat by the immune system and are attacked leading to irritation and inflammation. * Microvillous inclusion disease, a condition caused by a genetic mutation leading to severe diarrhea because intestinal cells did not have normal development and thus the intestines are not able to absorb nutrients properly. * Congenital chloride diarrhea, a lifelong condition caused by a genetic mutation that leads to diarrhea with a high concentration of chloride. * Congenital sodium diarrhea, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in electrolyte transporters that disrupt the transport of Na+ across the intestine and results in high levels of Na+ greater than 145 mM in the stool. * Congenital short-bowel syndrome, a condition in which a portion of the small intestine is absent or not functioning properly leading to decreased absorption of both fluids and nutrients. * Congenital lactase deficiency, a condition caused by a genetic mutation in which the body cannot digest lactose properly. * Glucose-galactose malabsorption, a genetic disorder caused by changes in a protein critical for the transport of glucose and galactose across the intestine which leads to impaired glucose/galactose absorption, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in young children. Typically, the severe diarrhea improves with a diet low in glucose/galactose and the tolerability to glucose/galactose improves with age. * Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a gut motility disorder characterized by a lack of nerve cells in the large intestine which are needed to move the stool through the digestive tract. In infants, HSCR typically presents when a newborn is unable to pass the first feces, or meconium within 48 hours of birth. Other symptoms include blockage of the intestine, fever, rapid release of stool and flatulence upon rectal examination, and may present with diarrhea in infants. * Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO), a gut motility disorder characterized by the inability to contract intestinal walls with symptoms similar to intestinal obstruction but lack a distinguishable cause of obstruction. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, dilated or enlarged bowel, constipation and may include diarrhea. Although rare in infants, IPO is a type of congenital disorder that may present with diarrhea in infants. * Primary bile acid malabsorption, a gut defect in the reabsorption of bile acids in the small intestine which results in increased levels of bile acids in the colon leading to watery diarrhea and bloating. * Chronic infection of C. difficile, G. lamblia ** C. difficile - bacteria that can be the source of diarrhea. ** G. lamblia - a parasite that can be the source diarrhea. From 1-12 months, typical causes of chronic diarrhea are the following: * Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which the intestine cannot absorb zinc. * Cystic fibrosis, a condition caused by a genetic mutation that can lead to injury to the body's organs including the lungs and those in the digestive system. * Apple juice and pear nectar, the digestive tract of children have difficulty absorbing significant quantities of sugars and carbohydrates which certain fruit juices can have. * Celiac Disease, a disorder in which there is an immune response to eating gluten which can eventually cause damage to the small intestine over time and impedes absorption. * Food allergy. Most instances of chronic diarrhea in infancy are caused by infectious and post infectious disease of the intestine as well as food sensitivities or allergies. Diagnosis Diagnosis of toddler's diarrhea involves the evaluation of history of present illness, any relevant past medical history, and physical examination to determine any causative factors to inform treatment regimens and further recommendations. Evaluation of history of present illness includes: * Stool characterization (i.e. appearance, consistency, frequency, etc.) * Time frame and duration (important for differentiation between acute and chronic diarrhea) * Food/drink allergies or restrictions (e.g. lactose intolerance) * Medications, especially antibiotics * Infection exposure (e.g. travel) Evaluation of past medical history includes: * Family history * Conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease Physical examination involves: * Abdominal examination (tenderness, distention, and/or bowel sounds) * Genital examination (rashes, anal fissures, and/or ulcerative lesions) * General assessment and vital signs (any signs of dehydration such as tachycardia and low blood pressure) * Examination of extremities and head (any signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and skin turgor)  Diagnostic Tests  The following tests can also be performed to assist in the diagnosis of toddler's diarrhea and evaluation of any associated complications/underlying conditions: * Stool tests provide further information about bleeding, infectious agents, and/or anatomical problems. * Blood tests allow assessment of inflammatory markers and/or other criterion for causative diseases. * X-rays provide evaluations of any problems that may originate in the gastrointestinal tract/liver/etc. * Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy allows visualization of the gastrointestinal tract to assess location of inflammation. * Breath hydrogen tests are utilized to determine lactose, fructose, and/or sucrose intolerance. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may also be indicated by this test. = Genetic Testing = Most commonly, chronic diarrhea in infants and children are classified as acquired diarrhea, identified with the general diagnostic tests mentioned above. The other classification of chronic diarrhea, congenital diarrheas and enteropathies (CODEs), are rare diagnoses of exclusion. With recent advances in genome sequencing, the addition of targeted genetic testing to diagnostic algorithms has been proposed to allow faster diagnoses and earlier treatment of CODEs. While certain genes and mutations have been associated with various CODEs, further research and studies are necessary to support the role of diagnostic genetic testing. Treatment and Management According to doctors of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), treating the cause of chronic diarrhea in infants is primarily through diet (e.g. avoiding foods their bodies don't tolerate such as gluten, lactose, fructose, and sucrose). Dietary fiber and fat can be increased and fluid intake, especially fruit juice intake, decreased. With these considerations, NIDDK doctors recommend that children consume a normal balanced diet based on their age to avoid malnutrition or growth restriction. Non-prescription medications such as loperamide are not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for children below 6 years of age as they don't address the underlying cause of the condition. According to Benjamin Ortiz, M.D., a pediatrician in the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Pediatric Therapeutics, bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended in children below 12 years of age because its contents, including magnesium, aluminum, and bismuth, are not readily cleared from their bodies, making them more susceptible to harm. Studies have shown that certain probiotic preparations such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus (a bacterium) and Saccharomyces boulardii (a yeast) may be effective at reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea in acute settings as a result of gastroenteritis, while other studies have found that the use of probiotics doesn't have an effect on the length of diarrhea in toddlers. While treatments for chronic diarrhea of infancy aren't clear cut, it is crucial to address the complications of dehydration that may arise from chronic diarrhea with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommendation of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Oral rehydration solution (ORS), recommended by both AAP and the World Health Organization (WHO), must be composed of 50-90mEq/L sodium and 2% glucose or other complex carbohydrates. ORS is easily found in the US because it is available without a prescription. The typical amount of ORS administered is 50mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for mild dehydration and 100mL/kg over a 4 hour time period for moderate dehydration with an extra 10mL/kg for every loose stool. Repeat this administration regimen for as long as the signs and symptoms of dehydration continue. It is important to take measures early on to maintain hydration. Along with ORT, WHO recommends a 10-14 day course of 20mg zinc tablet supplementation, stating it will shorten the length of diarrhea and potentially improving harmful outcomes. The NIDDK recommends a visit to the doctor when a child experiences stools containing pus or blood (black, tarry, or coffee ground-like appearance), signs of dehydration, diarrhea longer that 24 hours, or a fever of 102 degrees or more.  Epidemiology  Diarrheal illness in children accounts for 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide. It is responsible for the secondary cause of mortality among children less than 5 years of age surpassing the combined childhood deaths from malaria, measles, and AIDS. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea in children less than 5 years old. More than half of the cases occurred in Africa and South Asia. It is estimated that Africa and South Asia comprise more than 80% of deaths from diarrhea in children. In fact, about 75% of the childhood deaths from diarrhea come from only 15 countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of deaths attributable to diarrheal illness among children less than 5 years of age was 13.2% in 2002. Half of these childhood deaths were due to chronic diarrheal causes. Worldwide, studies estimate that diarrheal illness affects 3 to 20% of children under the age of 5 with an incidence of 2.7 episodes of diarrhea per child-year. Developing nations experience higher burden of disease and mortality from chronic diarrhea in children compared to developed nations. In the United States, it is reported that 15 to 20% of young children have an episode of acute diarrhea each year. Compared to worldwide estimates, the United States has a lower incidence rate of chronic diarrhea in young children reported at 0.18 episodes per child year. In pediatrics, diarrhea is a common complaint making up 9% of U.S. hospital visits for children less than 5 years old. In contrast to resource-poor nations, resource-rich nations such as the United States experience less chronic diarrhea severity. In the United States, approximately a quarter of chronic diarrhea cases in young children seek medical care and less than 1% of cases are hospitalized.

The film was shot on location in Primo≈°ten and ≈†ibenik. Summary The film is set in Croatia in mid-1991, after the Croatian Parliament had proclaimed the country's independence, seceding it from Yugoslavia. However, army garrisons around the country are still held by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which does not acknowledge the parliament's decision. The JNA garrisons are largely manned by conscripts hailing from all over Yugoslavia who are serving their compulsory military service, and headed by senior officers who ignore Croatian demands that the JNA should leave Croatian territory and release Croats under their command. In this backdrop, the film begins with the arrival of art historian Bla≈æ Gajski (played by Vlatko Duliƒá) to a small unnamed Croatian island with the intention of rescuing his son Zoran (Leon Luƒçev) who is serving at the local JNA barracks. Gajski finds the situation on the island tense ‚Äì the police have surrounded the barracks, locals are picketing the garrison, and the local commanders go in to negotiate a peaceful surrender of the compound with barracks commander major Aleksa Milosavljeviƒá (Ljubomir Kereke≈°). However, Aleksa brushes them off, has the barracks rigged with explosives and threatens to blow everything up in case of any attempts to take the garrison by force. In response, islanders stage a non-stop festival in front of the compound, with rock bands and marching bands playing music, and with islanders reciting poems and giving speeches (including Aleksa's own wife) in the hope of convincing Aleksa to back down. Meanwhile, the locals' commander has the garrison's power and phone lines cut. The locals then intercept an army radio transmission and, posing as army command, tell Aleksa not to do anything until a \\"colonel Kostadinoviƒá\\" arrives to give him detailed instructions, in order to buy more time to wear him down. After failing to get in the garrison or contact the commander, Gajski tries to get help from the locals in getting his son released, but everyone on the island seems completely engrossed by their own role in the events. He borrows a JNA officer uniform and enters the barracks, posing as colonel Kostadinoviƒá. There, he manages to retrieve his son and some soldiers, along with the full cache of explosives. As major Aleksa realizes he was deceived, he orders the remaining soldiers to open fire at the people gathered in front of the barracks, mortally wounding a poet reciting a poem. Reception In spite of being filmed as a television production (the film was shot on 16 mm film, and later transferred to 35 mm film before being released to theaters), the film's blend of comedy and drama was well received by Croatian audiences. During its cinema run the film was seen by around 346,000 people in the country, which made it the most popular Croatian title of the 1990s, as well as one of the most popular Croatian films of all times. The film won Grand Prize at the 1997 Cottbus Film Festival of Young East European Cinema and three Golden Arena Awards at the 1996 Pula Film Festival (Best Director, Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Costume). In 1999, a poll of Croatian film fans found it to be one of the best Croatian films ever made.

The Colonial Houses of Worship in America. New York: Hastings House, Publishers, 1963, p. 290. \\"164 Arney's Mount Friends Meeting House (1775) Burlington County, New Jersey\\" History In 1743, Friends living near Shreve's Mount (later called Arney's Mount for an early settler, Arney Lippincott) asked the Burlington Monthly Meeting for permission to worship on the first day of each week, during the winter season, at the meeting house near Caleb Shreve's Mount. Some years later a meeting house was erected. The builder was Samuel Smith, whose name appears on the stone above the front doorway. As years passed the area changed and attendance at Arney's Mount Meeting declined. The Preparative Meeting, established in 1776, was laid down in 1871. The meeting house continued to be used at times for worship and Firstday school. Since 1941 meeting for worship usually has been held twice monthly. Architecture Sign above the front entrance of Arney's Mount Friends Meetinghouse The building is an unusual example of early stone masonry construction in a Friends Meeting House. Built of local bog iron stone quarried from the mount on which it stands, Arney's Mount is unusual in South Jersey as most meeting houses are constructed of brick. The pillars supporting the gallery are turned from solid wood, the beaches are held together with hand forged bolts and the interior woodwork is in its natural aged hue. The windows are placed in an irregular line to afford the maximum amount of light to the interior, which has an upper gallery on three sides which can be opened or closed by hand-hewn panels which rise into the attic area. No paint has ever been used in the interior, and no electricity, formal heating or plumbing has ever been installed. The original cedar roof is now asphalt shingle. A chunk stove replaces the original \\"pot-bellied\\" stove which was stolen several years ago, but it serves to warm the house when winter meetings are held. Horse sheds stood near the south boundary wall, which still holds the iron hitching rings. According to oral tradition, Samuel Smith was the builder. Inscribed in a stone of the meeting house is \\"S. Smith.\\" It was not uncommon within mainstream culture for the builder to carve his initials upon the structure. Such practices were generally frowned upon by Quakers. It was viewed as vain, and ran contrary to the communal nature of the design and building process. More common among Friends was the practice of carving initials merely as a form of graffiti on the interior benches, and sometimes on the facades of meeting houses, although rarely are they so prominently placed. Members of the Smith family attended Arney's Mount meeting and acted as trustees for the meeting, and therefore could have played an important role in the construction of the meeting house. On the opposite side of the meeting house is the name \\"I. Coate.\\" This suggests that Smith was not solely responsible for the construction of the meeting house. Perhaps one's role was largely financial while the other served as builder. The interior was twice damaged by fire. Oral tradition and various secondary sources provide the only substantive information. According to one source, the fire took place on February 17, 1800, destroying the roof and much of the woodwork. The floor was supposedly saved by the snow, which was thrown in through the doors and windows. The only piece of information found is a scant reference appearing in a book of \\"Miscellaneous Accounts, 1797-1882.\\" An entry made on December 28, 1801 reads: \\"paid Thomas Harrison one Dollar for service done at the time the Mount Meeting House was Burnt.\\" The second fire, in 1809, nearly destroyed the building except for its stone walls. Evidence of the fire can be found in the charred remnants of the former landing, visible beneath the cabinet stairs located in the southeast and southwest corners of the meeting house. The only mention that appears within the preparative minutes are the findings of those requested to \\"examine the accounts of the committee appointed to rebuild the meeting house.\\" The meeting house is remarkably preserved from its 1811 appearance when portions of the building were reconstructed after the fire. The building was vacant from 1871 until the meeting was revived in 1941. Burial grounds Burial ground at Arney's Mount Friends Meetinghouse The burial grounds are still in use and pre-dates the meeting house by many years. Meeting records indicate settlement in the area before the first petition to Burlington Monthly Meeting to build this existing building in 1743. The stone wall, built in 1680, encloses only a portion of the grave as many persons were literally buried \\"outside the wall\\" having lost favor with the Meeting, or were buried elsewhere on the grounds in unmarked sites before the walls were constructed. According to the custom of Friends, graves in the earliest period were not marked. Records were kept by row. Later, markers were used, and some bear dates earlier than the formal establishment of the Meeting. In 1870, a wall of native sandstone was erected around the graveyard. Names in the graveyard include those of the early settlers in the area such as \\"Lamb\\", \\"Lappencott\\", \\"Shreve\\", \\"Gaskill\\" and 'Newbold\\", and many others important to the heritage of Mount Holly and Pemberton, New Jersey. It is still in use as a meeting house and the burial ground is still receiving requests for interment.

Converted to a dormitory in the 1920s, it suffered neglect until finally collapsing in 1996. The site now contains remnants of the foundation, assorted cement structures, and a distinct lintel gate and wall facing the street. The site was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places (under the Chinese Tong Houses of Maui Island TR nomination form), but delisted from the State register after its collapse; it is still listed in the NRHP database. History It is unclear when the society hall was first built due to conflicting information; County of Maui records indicate that the building was first listed as being built in 1897, though an article from December 1904 by the Maui News lists the building being built and celebrations made upon completion of the society hall on January 14 and 15, 1905.Exploring Historic Wailuku pg. 102 The hall provided a place for Chinese immigrants to visit, socialize (such as playing pai gow), and provide aid.Maui Remembers pg. 49 Sometime in 1928, it was noted that the society hall was converted for use as a dormitory by single men, and this use was supposedly practiced up until the 1960s. After the last occupant died, the property was neglected. Collapse In September 1988, part of a wall of the building collapsed, smashing adjacent trees, plants, and two clothesline poles in a neighboring property. On April 17, 1996, the derelict wood building collapsed due to damage caused by wood rot, termites, and gravity. Before the collapse, Society Elders had planned to meet to discuss the fate of the building. Certain elements of the building were to have been recovered, and possibly reused in the reconstruction of the building. Design The property is according to Maui County tax records via the Department of Finance's Real Property Division and the NRHP nomination form. The entrance gate comprises two concrete posts and a lintel with Chinese characters on it. Formerly delineated in red, the front facing the street contains incused Chinese characters spelling out Chee Kung Fui Kon (the name of the society), and the back containing the phrase (translated as) Everyone is equal. The main building was a rectangular, two-story structure approximately by , with covered verandas on both floors. Architectural elements included shingled intersecting gabled roofs with gabled ends and fish-scaled shingles painted in various colors. Assorted other details included a scalloped archway, chamfered posts, decorative wheel and quatrefoil brackets, and an entrance gable with a carved bridgeboard. Diamonds and rectangles were also incorporated into the structure via ornamental lintels and balustrades. A trapezoid cinder block structure approximately by stood next to the building to the east.

Current condition Today, the site consists of only a few cement structures and several trees obscuring the front of the property. The gate and adjoining walls, stairs, sidewalks, foundation pillars, and the cinderblock addition lie in decrepit condition. The phrase Everyone is equal is barely discernible behind the lintel on the gate.

He subsequently went into partnership with Charles Appleton 1835 (a merchant who had opened a store in Sydney in 1825) forming the firm 'Appleton & Jones'. The partnership was dissolved in 1838 when he established 'David Jones & Co', at 463 George Street, thereby establishing one of the oldest surviving department stores in the world. In 1849 Jones leased the 'Jerusalem Warehouse' on the corner of Barrack and George streets and converted it into a two-storey shop. This would be the main location of David Jones until the opening of the Elizabeth St store in 1928. Now a successful citizen of the colony, Jones invested in various other business interests, including as founding Director of Australian Mutual Provident Society in 1848. He was also a founder of Camden College, and was very involved in Pitt St (now Pitt St Uniting), the local Congregational Church.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 for its significance in community planning, development, and education from 1855 to 1920. With At the time of its construction, the village of Glendale was impacted by the train station stop of Ashland on the Camden Atlantic Railroad. Because of the railroad, Philadelphians and shore villagers came to trade and do business.  Building Design  The Greek Revival church building was constructed in 1855 on a sloped piece of land. It includes a church on the top level and a public school on the bottom level. The church entrance, directly facing Haddonfield-Berlin Road, includes a few steps that bring you to the door, bringing you to the back of the church. The direct opposite side of the house, at the bottom end of the slope, brings you into the school.  School History, Background, and Significance  The Glendale School or Glendale Methodist Sunday School was located in the basement of the church and is considered one of Camden County's oldest public schools. The school was started by the following Glendale village members: Richard Stafford, Catherine Engle, Nixon Davis, Joseph C. Stafford, Jesse Patterson, Israel Riggins, Montgomery Stafford, and Theodore Bishop. There was a story passed down about the school that one of its founding members, Alexander Cooper, originally built the school in support of the prohibitionist cause, especially because of the fact that there was a nearby tavern constructed down the street from the church.  Glendale Methodist Episcopal Church During the Temperance Movement  Many church members were petitioning for acts that represented Alexander Cooper's supposed act in Congress. The Congressional Record of 1898 documents the Church members of Glendale Methodist Episcopal Church petitioning against the sale and use of liquor in governmental buildings and negation of anti-cigarette laws.  Walt Whitman‚Äôs Time at The Glendale Methodist Episcopal Church  It has been documented that Walt Whitman would often come to Glendale Methodist Episcopal Church to spend his weekend in Glendale during the mid to late 1800s. Oftentimes, he would spend his time praying at the church, walking in on classes at the school, or even bathing in the creek in the back of the church. During some of his time there, Walt Whitman even took time to write his novel, Specimen Days.  The 20th and 21st Centuries for Glendale Methodist Episcopal Church  By the time 1920 hit, the church and school ceased to operate. The place where the school stood was often used for community functions and events. After a multitude of events that came through the church, it was finally given a grant award of $123875 in 2004, which was used five years later, in 2009, to renovate the church. As of 2018, the church is 163 years old and is used for congregants all around the Camden County area to celebrate Methodist Episcopal holidays and events.

This decision afforded them a historic opportunity to affect the 2004 presidential election, but it also opens schisms that threatens the unity of the Log Cabin itself.

Kennedy Medical Center (JFK), an affiliate of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH), is a 499 bed full-service, acute care hospital, and the home of the JFK Johnson Rehabilitative Institute. The hospital is affiliated with Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and is located in Edison, New Jersey. JFK Medical Center accommodates more than 20,000 admissions, 3,000 births and 60,000 emergency department visits on a yearly basis. The medical center features a complete array of services, including general surgery, emergency medicine, psychiatry, orthopedics, maternity and pediatric care. It is home to two well known institutes: the JFK New Jersey Neuroscience Institute, JFK Stroke and Neurovascular Center and the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute, as well as JFK Haven Hospice, JFK Imaging Center, and the Center for Wound Healing. JFK also has a Level II Special Care Nursery to treat premature and otherwise ill newborns which is staffed by Onsite Neonatal Partners. JFK Medical Center‚Äôs Johnson Rehabilitation Institute (JRI) has been ranked as one of the best hospitals in the nation for 2013‚Äì14 for rehabilitation by U.S. News & World Report. JFK Medical Center's Stroke and Neurovascular Center (SNC) is designated as a Comprehensive Stroke Center by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. SNC also has the highest level of designation of Comprehensive Stroke Center, by the Joint Commission. SNC was the first Joint Commission designated Comprehensive Stroke Center in the Tristate (New Jersey/New York/Connecticut) area (2012). SNC has the only teaching program in the state of New Jersey to offer an advanced comprehensive combined fellowship in Vascular Neurology, Neurocritical Care and Endovascular Surgical Neuroradiology. Established (2009) and led by Dr. Jawad F. Kirmani, SNC has an advanced research program with capabilities of clinical, basic and translational research.  History  JFK Medical Center began in the 1960s as a grassroots campaign in response to the increasing demand for health care services created by a rapid population growth occurring in Edison, Woodbridge, Metuchen, and surrounding communities. The late Edison mayor, Anthony M. Yelencsics, for whom the original community hospital was named, led this effort. Mayor Yelencsics was appointed board chairman of the future hospital and his first official action was to establish a Women‚Äôs Auxiliary. The Mayor asked long-time community resident and advocate, Mrs. Charles Wira of Edison to take on the responsibility of starting the Auxiliary ‚Äì in order to raise funds and solicit support for the future community hospital. Mayor Yelencsics convinced Edison officials to donate nearly 40 acres of township land for the hospital. He then lobbied with congressional leaders ‚Äì such as Middlesex County‚Äôs own Rep. Edward J. Patten ‚Äì to win $1.1 million in Hill-Burton funds, which at the time represented the largest single grant awarded in the state of New Jersey under that program. By this time, before the hospital had even opened its doors, more than $110,000 in pledges had been raised in community donations by the Auxiliary. In 1974, the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute (JRI) was added as a major component of JFK Medical Center. JFK Johnson is the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In 1992, JFK Neuroscience Institute (NSI) was started. In 1997, Solaris Health System was formed by joining JFK Medical Center and Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center in Plainfield, New Jersey. In 2009, JFK Stroke & Neurovascular Center was established. JFK Medical Center, hence became, a premier Comprehensive Stroke Center in the State of New Jersey. In 2018, JFK Medical Center became an integral part of Hackensack Meridian Health with a merger resulting in JFK providing a leadership role for the largest Health Network in Central New Jersey. JFK Medical Center also became the academic hub in Central New Jersey for the newly established Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University. To integrate the Patient Care, Educational and Research Goals across the newly formed network of hospitals spanning North, Central and South New Jersey Clinical Transformation Services were formed. A very active system-wide Stroke Council has been the flag bearer of Health care integration in the region. Stroke Council was established by Central Region President and CEO Mr. Raymond Fredericks in May, 2018. He nominated Jawad F. Kirmani, MD as the Founding Chair of the System Wide HMH Stroke Council. Stroke Council further established North, Central and Southern NJ Region Task Forces in April, 2019. Many of the best Stroke Neurologists, Neurosurgeons and Neurointerventionalists have featured in Stroke Council meetings in collaborative efforts to transform stroke care across the region.

History Loose Blues was recorded for the Riverside label, but eventually dropped mostly because of Riverside's forthcoming bankruptcy and the pressures of Verve producer Creed Taylor ‚Äì who wanted Evans on his Verve label.Original 1982 liner notes by Orrin Keepnews. So the project was shelved, and released posthumously only in 1982 as MCD-9200-2, after having been rediscovered in the Fantasy Records vaults. This was, in fact, believed to be a lost album since producer Orrin Keepnews could not find the master reels of the session dates, except for a take of \\"Loose Bloose\\". However, after a thorough research, he did succeed in finding the reels \\"stored in poorly marked tape boxes\\". The material was then assembled by Keepnews and Ed Michel. \\"Fudgesickle Built for Four\\" was named by Evans himself (reflecting his love of puns) and was a reference to \\"a bicycle built for two\\", a line from the popular song \\"Daisy Bell\\". Keepnews, recalling the sessions, stated that \\"My Bells\\", which is characterized by difficult tempo changes, took 25 takes to be recorded properly. Evans would only revisit \\"Time Remembered\\", \\"My Bells\\" and \\"Funkallero\\" for later recordings. Reception The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: \\"Due to some difficulties during the recording process (none of the sidemen were familiar with the often complex numbers), the results were originally shelved and lost for a couple of decades. This CD reissue shows that the music was actually much better than originally thought..., It is a pity that Evans and Sims (a logical combination) never did record together again.\\"Yanow, S.

The building was sold in 2015 and is currently a community hub for the neighbourhood. History The Anglican Diocese of Ottawa was only two-years- old when on 15 April 1898, Mr Henry Newell Bate (Chairman of the Ottawa Improvement Commission) asked Bishop Charles Hamilton to form a new parish in Ottawa. By 24 June, all of the necessary preparations had been made. Bate laid the first stone himself on 2 April 1899. The chief cornerstone was laid by the Bishop on 7 June that same year. The first services were held in the church on 4 February 1900.[\\"All Saints' Church, Ottawa : your church\\" by All Saints' Church (Ottawa, Ont.) Call Number 365.O.15.1] The first Rector of All Saints‚Äô was the Reverend A. W. Mackay, the former Curate of the old Saint John‚Äôs Anglican Church, which was on Sussex Street where the Connaught Building stands today. He held this post until his death in August 1919. The church, however, was not consecrated until the 1 February 1914. This was done following the decision by (now Sir) Henry Bate to give the church and land to the Rector and his wardens as a gift on 21 January. The church at Chapel Street at Laurier Avenue, which was designed 1898-99 by Alfred Merigon Calderon, is of Gothic revival design.Alfred Merigon Calderon The church features a crenellated tower with a nine-bell chime, and no fewer than fourteen stained glass windows. Commemorated by memorial windows, are MacKay, Sir Robert Laird Borden, Prime Minister from 1911 to 1920, and several other former members of the congregation. In 1934, Bate Memorial Hall was added by Thomas Cameron Bate (son of Sir Henry Bate) in honour of the church‚Äôs founder. The church also held the state funeral for Sir Robert Borden, in 1937. In 2014, the church community merged with St. Margaret's Anglican Church, Vanier, and the historic building was put up for sale. The site was purchased in December 2015 by All Saints Development Inc., who plan to turn the site into a community hub containing a wedding venue, a conference centre, and other amenities. The space will also be an interpretive centre for Prime Minister's Row, an improvement initiative for the historical neighbourhood. References * Also . * C.H.

It refers specifically to the time period between 1789 and 1848 in which the political and ideological changes of the French Revolution fused with and reinforced the technological and economic changes of the Industrial Revolution. The French Revolution, inspired by the ideals of Enlightenment philosophy, spread ideas of democracy, nationalism, and liberalism. These political ideas were fused with the new technological advances of the industrial revolution such as the spinning jenny, steam engines, and the puddling process. With the defeat of the French Revolution and subsequently the Congress of Vienna, Metternich constructed a balance of power in Europe that would prevent one country from gaining too much power. This set the framework for a strong conservative, reactionary stance against the ideas of nationalism and liberalism spread by the dual revolution. The Holy Alliance, formed by Austria, Prussia and Russia in September 1815 became a symbol of oppression to the ideas spread by the Dual Revolution.  Industrial Revolution  Generally, Industrial Revolution means transitioning from hand produced to machines. In the case of the dual revolution, the Industrial portion was more from social scientists like Count Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, and Karl Marx who attempted to come up with ideas for ‚Äúutopias‚Äù, conservative and socialist societies.  French Revolution  The French Revolution began in 1789 with the Tennis Court Oath, by which the members of the third estate, who had been locked out of the meeting the estates general, gathered together and swore not to disband until they had written a new constitution. Inspired by the ideas of Enlightenment Philosophers, most prominently Rousseau and his social contract, the National assembly, those who had sworn the tennis court oath, published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was very much an expression of Enlightenment ideals. A major portion of the Declaration was dedicated to the natural rights of man. According to the Declaration every man is entitled to life, liberty and property. This is a reflection of the beliefs of John Locke who wrote the 2nd treatise of civil government. The Committee of Public Safety, headed by Robespierre, which rose to power after using the sans culotte to imprison the other members of the Jacobin club, was based on Rousseau's Social Contracts idea of the general will. Rousseau states that at times people have to sacrifice their natural rights for the greater good which is represented by the General Will. The General Will is not necessarily represented by the majority, a far-seeing minority can represent the general will. Robespierre believed that the Committee of Public Safety represented the general will. Robespierre used an aggressive revolutionary purge of those who opposed the Committee called the Terror, a planned economy, and French Nationalism inspired by the revolution to increase French military size and push armies into most of western Europe.  Nationalism  Nationalism was a driving force for European politics after the French revolution. The ideas of Nationalism emphasized both national pride and that each nation, which consists of a people of the same culture and language should coincide with the boundaries of the state. Metternich, the Austrian Chancellor, was conservative precisely because nationalism was very dangerous to the massive, multi-ethnic Austria. Increased national identity and pride garnered from the successes of ones country were another reason for increased European colonialism during the later parts of the 19th century.  Liberalism  Liberalism was a major movement post French Revolution. It was an expression of enlightenment ideals. Liberals believed in freedom of the press, freedom of speech, civil rights, fair elections, capitalism, freedom of religion and private property. Ideas of liberalism greatly influenced the 1848 revolutions which were led by students and the middle class.  Conservatism  Conservatism is based on traditional strategies like absolute monarchies. It is a reactionary stance against the ideas spread by the dual revolution. Conservatism is closely linked to Classicism.

In the 1950s, he joined Air France as a pilot. This is where he met his wife, Rosemarie, a German, who was then a stewardess.  Hijacking  On 27 June 1976, Bacos was piloting an Airbus A300 flight from Athens to Paris, originating in Tel Aviv. Minutes into the flight, Bacos heard screams and quickly realized that the plane was being hijacked. Bacos was forced at gunpoint to re-route the plane. He recalled later: \\"The terrorist had his gun pointed continuously at my head and occasionally he would poke my neck not to look at him. We could only obey the orders of the terrorists.\\" Bacos was forced to turn the plane south to Benghazi, Libya, for refueling, and then to fly in a south-eastern direction. He landed the jet at Entebbe, Uganda, with only 20 minutes' fuel left. The terrorists freed the 148 non-Jewish passengers, and offered to release Bacos and his crew. They felt duty-bound to remain on the plane, and refused to leave. They stayed behind with the Jewish hostages. The captives were freed in an Israeli commando raid known as Operation Entebbe, and Bacos was dazed in the attack. After the hijacking, Bacos took a two-week holiday and requested that his first flight back be to Israel.  Awards and later life  In 1976, Bacos was awarded the National Order of the Legion of Honour, the highest decoration in France, by President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. The Israeli government awarded Bacos and his crew medals for heroism, for refusing to leave the Jewish passengers behind.David Kaplan, \\"A Historic Hostage-Taking Revisited,\\" The Jerusalem Post, 3 August 2006, Retrieved 20 June 2011.

Ball√©n presidency In 1992, Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n won his third run for the presidency. His tough macroeconomic adjustment measures were unpopular, but he succeeded in pushing a limited number of modernization initiatives through Congress. Dur√°n Ball√©n's vice president, Alberto Dahik, was the architect of the administration's economic policies, but in 1995, Dahik fled the country to avoid prosecution on corruption charges following a heated political battle with the opposition. A war with Peru (named the Cenepa War, after a river located in the area) erupted in January‚ÄìFebruary 1995 in a small, remote region, where the boundary prescribed by the 1942 Rio Protocol was in dispute. The Dur√°n-Ball√©n Administration can be credited with beginning the negotiations that would end in a final settlement of the territorial dispute. Bucaram presidency In 1996, Abdal√° Bucaram, from the populist Ecuadorian Roldosista Party, won the presidency on a platform that promised populist economic and social reforms. Almost from the start, Bucaram's administration languished amidst widespread allegations of corruption. Empowered by the president's unpopularity with organized labor, business, and professional organizations alike, Congress unseated Bucaram in February 1997 on grounds of mental incompetence. The Congress replaced Bucaram with Interim President Fabi√°n Alarc√≥n. Constitutional reform In May 1997, following the demonstrations that led to the ousting of Bucaram and appointment of Alarc√≥n, the people of Ecuador called for a National Assembly to reform the Constitution and the country's political structure. After a little more than a year, the National Assembly produced a new Constitution. Congressional and first-round presidential elections were held on May 31, 1998. No presidential candidate obtained a majority, so a run-off election between the top two candidates - Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad of the DP and the Right Wing √Ålvaro Noboa - was held on July 12, 1998. Mahuad won by a narrow margin. He took office on August 10, 1998. On the same day, Ecuador's new constitution came into effect. Mahuad's presidency Mahuad concluded a well-received peace with Peru on October 26, 1998, but increasing economic, fiscal, and financial difficulties drove his popularity steadily lower. However, the coup de grace for Mahuad's administration was Mahuad's decision to make the local currency, the sucre (named after Antonio Jos√© de Sucre), obsolete and replace it with the U.S. dollar (a policy called dollarization). This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless sucres to U.S. dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in U.S. dollars) gained wealth in turn. Under Mahuad's recession-plagued term, the economy shrank significantly and inflation reached levels of up to 60 percent.

L., & Redding, S. (Eds. (2010). Handbook on Effective Implementation of School Improvement Grants Center on Innovation & Improvement. Lincoln, IL. Announcement On December 3, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced the final requirements for $3.5 billion in Title I School Improvement Grants (SIGs) to turn around the nation‚Äôs lowest performing schools. The applications were due into the U.S. Department of Education by February. 8, 2010. These funds were made available to states by formula and competed for by school districts. As they competed for the funds, school districts/local educational agencies (LEAs) were required to identify the schools they wanted to transform, and then determine which of four models was most appropriate: the turnaround model, the restart model, school closure, or the transformation model. The law delineates the requirements for each of the four models. If a school had begun implementation of one of these four models or components of one of these models within the previous two years, it was permitted to apply to use SIG funds to continue to implement the full model. Lowest Achieving The SIG program reflects the federal government's prioritization of the lowest-achieving public schools. The Center on Innovation & Improvement, one of five federally funded content centers, has developed extensive guidance regarding implementation of the SIG program.Perlman, C. L., & Redding, S. (Eds.) (2009). Handbook on Effective Implementation of School Improvement Grants. Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from: http://www.centerii.org/handbook/ As outlined in the SIG regulations,U.S. Department of Education (2010).

Under guidance promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education, states must distribute 95% of their SIG grant dollars to districts and, in turn, districts must prioritize awards to districts based on need as measured by individual schools‚Äô academic performance and concentration of poverty. As outlined in the law, when awarding subgrants to districts, states must ‚Äúgive priority to the local educational agencies with the lowest- achieving schools that demonstrate ‚Äî (A) the greatest need for such funds; and (B) the strongest commitment to ensuring that such funds are used to provide adequate resources to enable the lowest-achieving schools to meet the goals under school and local educational improvement, corrective action, and restructuring plans under section 1116.‚Äù Under the 2010 guidance related to Section 1003(g), state departments of education are required to identify their ‚Äúpersistently lowest-achieving‚Äù schools . School districts that have schools identified as persistently lowest-achieving apply to the state department of education to obtain School Improvement Grants. As part of their grant application, districts must identify which of the four intervention models (i.e., turnaround, restart, closure, or transformation) they intend to implement in each of the identified lowest-achieving schools. While the LEAs must apply one of the four intervention models in schools defined as ‚Äúpersistently lowest-achieving,‚Äù once the state has allocated adequate resources to these schools, according to the federal requirements, the state can use the remaining School Improvement Grant funds for districts to implement other interventions and supports to improve other Title I schools (i.e., schools eligible for federal aid under Title I of ESEA [i.e., NCLB] due to high concentrations of poverty) in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. Tiers The SIG regulations define three tiers of schools for purposes of obtaining SIG funds.U.S. Department of Education. (2009).

Retrieved from: http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2009-3/082609d.html Each tier represents a level of priority for the SIG funds. In determining which districts receive grants, the state takes into account (1) the number of low- performing schools in the state, (2) the tiers these schools occupy, and (3) the LEA‚Äôs capacity to effectively implement the models and strategies outlined in the SIG application. The three tiers of schools identified as lowest achieving, in priority order for assistance through School Improvement Grants, are: * Tier I: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are identified by the SEA as ‚Äúpersistently lowest- achieving.‚Äù * Tier II: Secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I-Part A funds and are identified by the SEA as ‚Äúpersistently lowest-achieving.‚Äù * Tier III: Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are not Tier I schools. School Improvement Grant intervention models=Turnaround model Changes required to occur under the turnaround model as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education are: * Replace principal * Use locally adopted \\"turnaround\\" competencies to review and select staff for school (rehire no more than 50% of existing staff) * Implement strategies to recruit, place, and retain staff * Select and implement an instructional model based on student needs * Provide job-embedded professional development (PD) designed to build capacity and support staff * Ensure continuous use of data to inform and differentiate instruction * Provide increased learning time for staff and students * Provide social- emotional and community-oriented services and supports * Implement new governance structure * Grant operating flexibility to school leader Schools implementing the turnaround model may also implement any of the required or permissible strategies under the Transformation Model. The theory of action underlying the turnaround model is that the existing configuration of leadership and instructional personnel has not created a learning environment in which students are succeeding. Therefore, in order to dramatically change the environment for the benefit of the children currently enrolled in the school, the adults must change.Center on Innovation & Improvement (Writer, Producer), & Council of Chief State School Officers (Producer).

Lincoln, IL: Center on Innovation & Improvement. Retrieved from http://www.centerii.org/ Under the turnaround model, change entails literal change of personnel as well as behavioral change by the high- capacity personnel that remain. Restart model Under the restart model, the district converts a school or closes and reopens a school under a charter school operator, a charter management organization (CMO), or an education management organization (EMO) that has been selected through a rigorous review process.For additional information about charter management organizations, see: National Resource Center on Charter School Finance and Governance: http://www.charterresource.org/ A restart model must enroll, within the grades it serves, any former student who wishes to attend the school. A rigorous review process could take into consideration such things as an applicant‚Äôs team, track record, instructional program, model‚Äôs theory of action, and sustainability. As part of this model, a state must review the process the LEA will use/has used to select the partner.

School closure model School closure occurs when an LEA closes a school and enrolls the students who attended that school in other schools in the LEA that are higher achieving. Other schools should be within reasonable proximity to the closed school and may include, but are not limited to, charter schools or new schools for which achievement data are not yet available. The theory of action underlying the closure model is that school capacity according to multiple measures (e.g., academic performance, school culture/expectations, teacher performance, or facilities) is so low as to preclude a reasonable expectation of dramatic improvement for students currently enrolled.‚Ä¢ Steiner, L.

For example, in a September 25, 2009 open letter to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Gail Connelly, Executive Director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), wrote, ‚ÄúNAESP supports the Secretary‚Äôs initiative to identify the lowest performing schools, establish rigorous interventions, provide them sufficient resources over multiple years to implement those interventions, and hold them accountable for improving student performance. However, we fundamentally disagree with the approach to enact this wide-ranging and transformational reform initiative with the simplistic and reactionary step of replacing principals as the first step in turning around low-performing schools. NAESP strongly supports reform models that provide the essential resources existing principals of low-performing schools must have to succeed. These resources include the necessary time, talent and tools.‚Äù And on March 1, 2010, when President Obama gave a speech speaking of the necessity of letting go teachers at failing schools such as those in the Central Falls (RI) School District's only high school, Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, said, ‚ÄúThe tone used to describe the teachers in Central Falls has been disparaging and unforgiving. It's time for federal officials to get out of the blame game and into the classroom. One thing is certain: Firing the entire faculty of a school that is on the path to improvement is no recipe for turning around a struggling high school. And relying on a magical pool of ‚Äòexcellent teachers‚Äô to spring forth and replace them is na√Øve at best and desperately misguided. Approaches that point the finger at educators do nothing to bring about substantive improvements for students. To the contrary, it provides a momentary perception of correcting a problem. But in reality, we all know that the solution is not blame, it is collaboration‚Äîcollaboration among school employees, management, parents and communities. No one benefits when school staffs are summarily dismissed ‚Äî- not communities and certainly not students. In the end all that approach gets anyone is a good sound bite.‚Äù A critical review of School Improvement Grants was published by Craig Waddell, in April 2011.Waddell, Craig (2011). \\"School Improvement Grants: Ransoming Title I Schools in Distress\\".

It comes with a capacitive touchscreen and two cameras, a 5MP one with dual-LED flash on the back and a VGA-resolution one on the front for video calling; both are capable of video. The development was first disclosed in June 2009 and in October 2009 it was known that the tablet was capable of making 3G phone calls. The three buttons at the bottom (or right, when held in its normal landscape mode) are capacitive. The Android buttons used are Home, Menu, and Back. It features a Dell skin on top and has a cradle adapter with HDMI out. The phone lacks the navigational trackball found in many previous Android devices. While FM radio support is not an official feature, an FM radio chip was found upon inspection of the Streak's internal hardware, and can be accessed though a user's modification of the OS. The versions released previously have had Android 1.6 installed, with Dell offering unlocked Streaks with Android 2.2 (Froyo) in December 2010. Streak 5, back side Streak 7 Customers on the British O2 mobile phone network were given the opportunity to install Android 2.1 in early September 2010 through an Over the Air update. This update, however, caused an uproar amongst consumers, over bugs and removal of some features from the previous software. A seven-inch version of the Streak was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2011. The Wall Street Journal reviewed it unfavorably in February.Dell Streak 7 is No Real Deal Wall Street Journal 2011 Feb 09 A long-rumored ten-inch model went on sale in August in China.Streak 10 makes global debut in China VR-Zone, 19 July 2011 Following protests from users that Dell, by not including source code, had violated the terms of the GNU General Public License,https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/15/dell_streak/ the source code for the Dell Streak is now available for download. There is a root method for the Dell Streak, and many roms are available, including iterations of the CyanogenMod ROM. These are available from the xda-developers website along with other ROMS. Dell discontinued the Streak 5 on as of August 15, 2011. Customers attempting to purchase the device were directed to a \\"Good Bye, Streak 5\\" landing page. The larger Streak 7 was discontinued on December 2, 2011; Dell continues to sell a 10-inch tablet in China.Another Streak Tablet Bites the Dust PCWorld. 2011-12-05 Reception The Streak 7 received a tepid reaction from one reviewer due to its poor display and software bugs/glitches at launch. The Streak was considered bulky, and the Android 2.2 \\"Froyo\\" that it ran was geared more for smartphones instead of tablets. While almost all tablet computers released in 2011 had failed to gain much market share in the face of overwhelming demand for the Apple iPad 2, the Streak 7 compared poorly to other Android tablets such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab. InfoWorld has suggested that Dell treated the Streak as a \\"Frankenphone business\\", where OEMs see tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Android OS, but this approach neglected the user interface and this failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Samsung Galaxy Note with 5.3 in AMOLED display was first released in Germany in late October 2011 and received positive reviews, but with exception that users would look \\"like a fool\\" if they held it to their face to take a call.

The Austrians, under the leadership of Archduke John of Austria, forced their enemies to retreat, though they sustained greater losses than the French. Ampfing is located east of Munich and west of M√ºhldorf am Inn. In Spring 1800, while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany, Generals Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy. In June, Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo. On the Danube, the decisive Battle of H√∂chst√§dt, followed by success at Battle of Neuburg a few days later, allowed the French to take Munich and to control the Danube and its tributaries as far as Ingolstadt. With the French pressing on Austria from the north and through Italy, a truce ended hostilities for the rest of the summer. Despite these significant losses‚Äîboth of them decisive‚Äîthe Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms. After the expiration of the summer truce in November 1800, both the Austrian and French armies rushed to come to grips with each other in the terrain east of Munich. The newly appointed commander of Austrian forces, Archduke John, managed to bring the bulk of his army against Grenier's left wing of Jean Moreau's French army near Ampfing. Outnumbered, two French divisions fought a stubborn rear guard action for six hours before retreating in good order. Instead of being sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John and his staff became convinced that the enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops were waiting for the Austrians. The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later. Background Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).Timothy Blanning, The French Revolutionary Wars, New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 41‚Äì59. This treaty proved difficult to administer. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatized to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war.Blanning, pp. 200‚Äì280. By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.Blanning, p. 200. The Battles of Stockach and Engen in May 1800, followed by a larger battle at Messkirch, followed the Hohentwiel's capitulation to the French At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. P√°l Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.Arnold, pp. 197‚Äì199. The Battle of Messkirch was won from the high ground. Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe's corps to be sent to Italy after the initial battles on the Danube plain, but Moreau had other plans.Arnold, pp. 199‚Äì201. Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's army lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray's army still guarded the passes on the other side.Sloane, W.M. Life of Napoleon. France, 1896 (reprint, 1910), p. 109. Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the army of the First French Republic under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and the army of Habsburg Austria led by P√°l Kray. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat to Messkirch, where they enjoyed a more favorable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Voralberg was cut off.Sloane, p. 109. Jean Victor Moreau commanded the French Army of the Rhine. On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch. At nearby Krumbach, where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch. Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen, followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby Biberach ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000 man-strong French center's (commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint- Cyr), assault on the Austrian force.Sloane, pp. 109‚Äì110. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.Smith, p. 178. Strategic importance of Danube valley The French war goal, to occupy Vienna and force the Habsburgs to accept and comply with peace terms established in 1798, required a double-pronged invasion through northern Italy, which First Consul Napoleon commanded, and through southern Germany, a campaign that fell to Moreau. To secure access into Bavaria and, eventually, to Vienna, the French needed to control the Danube riverway. This was not a new tactic: this stretch of the river had been the site of major battles of the Thirty Years War and War of Spanish Succession. Between Ulm and Ingolstadt, the Danube grows significantly in volume, making it a wide and swift waterway. The Iller joins the Danube at Ulm, dumping massive amounts of water into the stream; at Donauw√∂rth, the Lech enters the Danube. Neuburg, the first significant city on the river after Donauw√∂rth, had been the family seat of the princes of Pfalz-Neuburg; taking it from a princely family of the Holy Roman Empire would be a blow to the morale and prestige of the Habsburgs, whose role it was to protect the small princely domains. Control of the bridges and passages between Ulm and Donauw√∂rth, Neuburg, then Ingolstadt offered an advantage of both transport and prestige.Andrew Beattie, The Danube: A Cultural History. Oxford University Press, 2010, pp. 29‚Äì33. There followed a series of battles and clashes along the Danube between Ulm and Ingolstadt. Once H√∂chst√§dt and its nearby bridges fell on 19 June, the French controlled the Danube crossings between Ulm and Donauw√∂rth. Kray abandoned Ulm, and withdrew further downstream. The next French target would be Neuburg. After a day-long battle for control of the river by Neuburg, the Austrians withdrew. Lecourbe ordered his troops not to pursue, as nightfall was on them. The French now controlled access to the Danube, its tributaries as far south as P√∂ttmes, and the banks on the north side of the river.\\"MacGowan, Neu. The loss of Neuburg broke the Austrian control along the strategic Danube. Similarly, in Italy, French successes at the battles at Montebello and Marengo forced Austrian withdrawal to the east. With France threatening Habsburg Austria from the northwest and southwest, the Austrians agreed to a cease fire. Subsequent peace negotiations were complicated by the alliance Austria had made with Britain, and which prevented her from signing any separate peace. Consequently, the British, although they had been successful in blockading French ports, entered the negotiations to bolster their weakened ally. Initially Britain refused the French terms and offered counter terms in September 1800. Negotiations continued; Napoleon later claimed that the Austrians did not negotiate in good faith, and sought only to gain time until \\"the rainy season\\" (winter), when army movements would be difficult, and the Habsburgs would have an entire season to recruit.Gaspard Baron Gourgaud, editor, Memoirs of the History of France during the reign of Napoleon I, Oxford, 18233, pp 1‚Äì23. Truce On 15 July 1800, France and Austria agreed to a truce that ended the summer campaign in southern Germany. Emperor Francis II dismissed P√°l Kray and appointed his brother, the 18-year-old Archduke John, to command the Austrian army. To compensate for the young man's inexperience, the emperor named Franz von Lauer as deputy commander and Oberst (Colonel) Franz von Weyrother became Chief of Staff. Both armies prepared for a renewal of hostilities, but an extension of the truce was signed on 20 September. At this time, the Bavarian fortresses of Ingolstadt, Ulm, and Philippsburg were ceded to the French, but these concessions allowed Austria to augment their field forces with 20,000 line infantry belonging to the garrisons. In the meantime, peace negotiations were continued.Arnold, p. 208 Resumption of hostilities Archduke John in 1800 The summer armistice held until 12 November 1800, when the French notified their enemies of their intention to end the truce in two weeks.Arnold, pp. 205, 213 The Austrians distributed 124,000 soldiers in an arc from W√ºrzburg in the north to Innsbruck in the south. Joseph-Sebastien von Simbschen held W√ºrzburg with 12,000 troops. Johann von Klenau and 14,000 soldiers defended the north bank of the Danube near Regensburg. Archduke John's main army, with 49,000 infantry and 16,500 cavalry, lay behind the Inn River near Braunau am Inn and Passau. Christian von Zweibr√ºcken's 16,000 Bavarians, W√ºrttembergers, Austrians, and French √âmigr√©s of the Army of Cond√© lay to the southwest of the main army, guarding the line of the Inn. Farther to the southwest, Johann von Hiller occupied Innsbruck with 16,000 troops.Arnold, pp. 209, 213 To counter the Austrians, the French fielded an even larger array of forces. From Frankfurt am Main, Pierre Augereau and 16,000 troops threatened Simbschen's northern wing. Moreau controlled 107,000 of the main army, deployed in four wings. Bruneteau de Saint-Suzanne's 24,000-strong detached force occupied the north bank of the Danube near Ingolstadt, Grenier's 24,000-man Left Wing deployed on the west bank of the Isar River near Landshut. Moreau massed the 36,000 soldiers of the Center around Munich under his personal control. The Right Wing of Lecourbe defended the line of the upper Lech River farther west. Lastly, Jacques MacDonald with the 18,000-strong Army of the Grisons threatened Hiller's force from Switzerland.Arnold, pp. 209, 211 Unlike most French armies of the Revolutionary period, Moreau's troops in late 1800 enjoyed a well-organized supply service. Though the onset of winter lengthened the army sick list, the months-long truce allowed many units to approach their full strength. Many French officers were confident of success.Arnold, p. 212 Moreau planned a broad-front advance eastward to the Inn, fighting any enemies as he found them. He would lead with his left to allow Lecourbe's Right Wing to advance unmolested, since it had a greater distance to cover. Once the French wings closed up to the Inn River, his troops would look for crossing sites. The aggressive Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer to launch an offensive. The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike in the direction of Landshut. From there, the Austrians would either wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly get across their enemies' line of communications to the west of Munich. However, in the last days of November, the Austrian army proved unable to advance with the necessary speed to turn the French north flank. Aware that their adversaries were also advancing, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich.Arnold, pp. 213‚Äì214 Battle By the evening of 30 November, the Austrian advance guard occupied Ampfing. At dawn on 1 December, Johann Riesch left the town with 12 battalions of infantry and 12 squadrons of cavalry, or approximately 14,000 men. Ludwig Baillet de Latour-MerlemontSmith-Kudrna, Ludwig Baillet. Arnold incorrectly names older brother Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour as a column commander. led nine battalions and 18 squadrons, or 12,000 soldiers, on Riesch's right flank. Latour quickly overran the French outposts and nearly surprised Michel Ney's division in its camp. Despite odds of four-to-one, the (French) 19th Cavalry Regiment charged their attackers, which included the Latour Dragoon Regiment # 11.Arnold, p. 217Smith, p. 188. Smith lists the Latour Dragoons as engaged. Paul Grenier The cavalry charge gave Ney enough time to place Desperri√®res' brigade in line of battle to meet the first shock. Ney's division included 8,200 infantry, 1,100 cavalry, and 14 cannons, but one of his three brigades was detached to the south at Wasserburg am Inn. Desperri√®res conducted an able defense, counterattacking when the 13th Dragoons rode to his support. Meanwhile, Ney directed the fighting on a second brigade front. At noon, a horse artillery battery led by Jean Baptiste Ebl√© arrived and its accurate fire quickly dismounted four Austrian guns and destroyed three caissons. Later, two pieces were overrun by Austrian hussars, but the French gunners rallied and recaptured the pieces in a horseback charge.Arnold, p. 218 Michel Ney While Latour battered against Ney, Riesch launched attacks against the 4,100 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, and 16 guns belonging to Jean Hardy's division. A brigade belonging to Claude Legrand's division marched up and helped block Riesch's attempt to turn Hardy's flank. During the fighting, a shellburst wounded Hardy and caused him to hand over command to BG Bastoul. With both French divisions being slowly pressed back by superior numbers, Grenier gave orders for a withdrawal.Arnold, pp. 218‚Äì219 Grenier directed his well-managed retreat along the road toward Haag, with all the units falling back in an orderly echelon. To save some artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After falling back , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they assumed a defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours.Arnold, pp. 219‚Äì220 In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.Smith, p. 188. Smith also specifies the Clerfayt (vacant) IR # 9, but this unit belonged to Kienmayer's corps and was unlikely to have fought at Ampfing. Result The Austrians suffered 303 killed, 1,690 wounded, and 1,077 captured. The French lost 193 killed, 817 wounded, and 697 captured.Arnold, p. 220 Expecting to fight a major battle the following day, the Austrian generals were surprised to find that the French evacuated Haag and vanished into the deep woods. Though Lauer counseled caution, the victory elated the inexperienced Archduke John, the aggressive Weyrother, and the army staff. They became convinced that they only faced French rear guards. \\"This erroneous idea prompted Austrian headquarters to ignore all normal precautions in the haste to come to grips [with the French force].\\"Arnold, p. 221 John ordered a pursuit toward Hohenlinden by the columns of Riesch, Latour, and Kollowrat, while drawing in FML Michael von Kienmayer's 16,000-strong column to form his northern flank.Arnold, p. 222 They chased after the French into the Ebersberg forest, but Moreau waited for the Austrian and Bavarian force in the Hohenlinden plain with four divisions and his cavalry reserve and ambushed them as they emerged from the forest. To complete the victory at Hohenlinden, MG Antoine Richepanse's division accomplished a surprise envelopment of the Austrian left flank.Arnold, pp. 225‚Äì228 This crushing victory, followed by several skirmishes and clashes along the Danube and in Bavaria, demoralized the Habsburg force. These, Coupled with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte's victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800, ended the War of the Second Coalition. In February 1801, the Austrians signed the Treaty of Lun√©ville, accepting French control up to the Rhine and the French puppet republics in Italy and the Netherlands. The subsequent Treaty of Amiens between France and Britain began the longest break in the wars of the Napoleonic period.Arnold, pp. 240-256 NotesSources * Arnold, James R. Marengo & Hohenlinden.

A hybrid of garden origin, it is the result of a cross between two distinct genera, Heuchera and Tiarella, and shows similarities to both parents. This type of intergeneric hybrid is quite rare, and is indicated by a multiplication symbol before the name. The name Heucherella is an example of a portmanteau word, a combination of the two parents' names. History √ó Heucherella was first bred in France in 1912 by Emile Lemoine, who created a sterile hybrid between Heuchera √ó brizoides and Tiarella cordifolia. It was later named √óHeucherella tiarelloides. 'Bridget Bloom' was bred in 1950s by Percy Piper, at the suggestion of Alan Bloom. It is a cross between Heuchera 'Freedom' with pink flowers and Tiarella wherryi. It was brought to Blooms of Bressingham in 1955 and had the market to itself until 1983, which was when 'Rosalie' appeared (Kemper, William T.) These two flowers have pink petals, resembling heuchera and tiarella, and some reddish purple markings on their dark green leaves. Around 1987 'Tinian Pink' and 'Tinian White' were both created by Charles Oliver of the Primrose Path. These go by the names 'Pink Frost' and 'Snow White' in the trade. Where a heucherella grows well depends on its breeding lines. Heucherellas bred from shade-loving heucheras will grow best in shade or part shade, those bred from sun-loving heucheras perform better in part shade to full sun. Most heucherellas have the strongest colors when grown in partial shade (preferably afternoon shade). Heucherella grow in USDA Zones 4‚Äì9, and in the milder zones are evergreen. Characteristics Heucherellas take their brilliant foliage colors from the Heuchera parents and the dark leaf patterns and cut-leaf shapes from the Tiarella parents. They are often called by their botanical name √ó Heucherella, but the common name in the USA is \\"foamy bells\\" because the common names of the parent plants are \\"coral bells\\", and \\"foam flower\\" respectively. Flowers may be white, pink or cream, and usually appear in spring. Heucherellas form clumps or small mounds of evergreen foliage with upright flower stalks long. Most heucherella prefer partial shade, though the newer strains are more sun tolerant. They prefer well-drained organic soils and regular watering. They send up new growth every year in spring. They make their best color displays in the cool seasons of spring or fall if they are of the colorful leaf type. They have few pests and diseases if grown in good soil in the proper conditions, and divided every three to four years. They can be used as ground cover underneath shrubs like dogwood or beautyberry, or in association with hostas, ferns, astilbes, coral bells, and other shade-loving perennials. Other plant associations include barrenwort, bleeding heart, Japanese painted fern, Jacob's ladder, lamium, lungwort and Solomon's seal. Heucherella can also be placed in large containers to brighten up shady areas.

It is endemic to the Northern Territory of Australia. Description Drosera falconeri superficially resembles the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula).Rice, B. A. 2006. Growing Carnivorous Plants. Timber Press: Portland, Oregon, USA. p. 91. Gibson, T. C., and D. M. Waller. 2009. Evolving Darwin's 'most wonderful' plant: ecological steps to a snap-trap. New Phytologist, 183: 575-587. In a review of the research on the evolution of the Venus flytrap from sticky- leaved ancestors, botanists Thomas Gibson and Donald Waller use D. falconeri as an example of a sticky-leaved species that shares many characteristics with the Venus flytrap, such as a wide petiole and lamina, and faces the same challenge of prey escape that the snap trap of the Venus flytrap evolved in response to. Drosera falconeri is a tropical perennial plant with a rosette body plan that is common for the genus Drosera. Deciduous leaves lay flat against the soil. Leaves are usually smaller at anthesis (flowering), but increase as the growing season progresses. Typical reniform lamina at maturity are long and wide, with leaves on older specimens being as wide as . It is unique in the subgenus because of its large leaves that are typically flat against the soil. Retentive mucilage-producing glands held on stalks ‚Äì structures known as tentacles ‚Äì appear on the margin of the lamina with shorter glands in the center of the leaf. The abaxial (underside) surface of the leaf is noticeably veined and sparsely covered with non-glandular white hairs. Petioles are oblanceolate and usually 10 mm long with varying widths: 2 mm near the center of the rosette, 3.5 mm near the center of the petiole, and 3 mm at the point of attachment to the lamina. The upper surface of the petiole is glabrous, but the margins and lower surface possess hairs similar to those of the abaxial leaf surface. One or two racemose inflorescences are produced per plant and are usually long. Approximately 12 flowers are found on one inflorescence with each white or pink flower held on a 3‚Äì5 mm long pedicel. The scape, inflorescence, and sepals are sparsely covered in white hairs. Flowers are composed of elliptic 3 mm long by 1.8 mm wide sepals, 7 mm long by 4 mm wide petals, five 2.7 mm long white stamens that produce orange anthers and pollen, a 1.1 mm diameter ovary with bilobed carpels and three white 2.5 mm long styles that are extensively branched toward the apex with terminal white stigmas. It typically flowers from November to December with only one flower open at a time, lasting for just one day whether it was pollinated or not. In the dry season the leaves die back and the plant survives by forming a bulb-like structure of tightly-packed leaf bases just below the soil's surface. This adaptation helps it avoid desiccation during the dry season. The hard clay soils acts as insulation; all other species in subgenus Lasiocephala use dense white hairs for insulation. Dormancy is typically broken with the first rains of the wet season and growth proceeds quickly. New growth, such as a new fibrous root system, new leaves, and the inflorescence, must build up reserves and set seed; a short wet season and sudden drought may cut the growing season considerably. New roots are white and fleshy, mostly serving as a water storage organ, while older roots become thinner and mostly anchor the plant. Its diploid chromosome number is 2n = 12.Hoshi, Yoshikazu. 2002. Chromosome studies in Drosera (Droseraceae). Proceedings of the 4th International Carnivorous Plant Conference. pp. 31-38. Hybrids It can readily hybridise with other species in the D. petiolaris complex, which includes the species in the subgenus Lasiocephala.Rice, B. 2008. The \\"petiolaris-complex.\\" The Carnivorous Plant FAQ. Retrieved 10 March 2010. Hybridisation is rare in the wild, however, because the soil types specific to individual parent species do not converge often. The first natural hybrid to be discovered was the product of D. falconeri and D. dilatato- petiolaris,Lowrie, A. 1998. Carnivorous Plants of Australia, vol. 3. Nedlands, Western Australia: University of Western Australia Press. pp. 168-171. later given the nomen nudum D. dilaconeri in 1991 by E. Westphal. Seed from this hybrid has proved to be viable which is an unusual characteristic for Drosera hybrids. Approximately four recognisable forms of this hybrid can be found in the wild. The characteristics favour one parent species or the other: some forms are smaller at in diameter while others can be up to in diameter, the leaf varies in size, and some hybrids will form clumps by producing plantlets like D. dilatato-petiolaris does while others will remain isolated.Lowrie, A. 1990. The Drosera petiolaris complex. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 19(3-4): 65-72. Drosera falconeri also hybridises with D. petiolaris; this hybrid was given the nomen nudum D. petioconeri by Westphal in 1991. Artificial hybrids involving D. falconeri have also been produced and cultivated, including a complex hybrid: (D. falconeri √ó D. ordensis) √ó (D. darwinensis √ó D. falconeri).Rivadavia, F. 2009. Drosera √ó fontinalis (Droseraceae), the first natural sundew hybrid from South America. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 38(4): 121-125. Distribution and ecology Drosera falconeri is common throughout the northern coastal areas of the Northern Territory in Australia. It was originally located along the Finniss River in alkaline sandy soils.D'Amato, P. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, California. p. 146. It is found growing in the grey silty clay soils in the Palmerston and Berry Springs regions and on Melville Island. While most carnivorous plants are calcifuges that cannot tolerate alkaline soils, D. falconeri grows on calcareous sandy soils with high pH values.Adlassnig, W., M. Peroutka, H. Lambers, and I. K. Lichtscheidl. 2005. The roots of carnivorous plants. Plant and Soil, 274: 127-140. Juniper, B. E., R. J. Robins, and D. M. Joel. 1989. The Carnivorous Plants. London: Academic Press Limited. p. 23. In the first account of this species' habitat, the soil pH at the site was recorded as pH 8.Tsang, P. 1980. A new Drosera from the top end of Australia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 9(2): 46 & 48. At the site where D. falconeri was first discovered, tall dense grass covered the small population. Botanical history and taxonomy Drosera falconeri was first discovered by a Mr Falconer in 1980 along the Finniss River in the Northern Territory. Falconer was collecting plants and tropical fish for Peter Tsang, a carnivorous plant enthusiast living in Queensland. Tsang then sent specimens on to Allen Lowrie and Bill Lavarack, a botanist with the Queensland National Parks. Tsang also prepared a short announcement of this new species published in the June 1980 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, giving a brief description and suggesting the specific epithet honour Mr Falconer as its discoverer. It was not until 1984 that Katsuhiko Kondo provided the formal description required under the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature in an article that described three new species in the D. petiolaris complex. The holotype specimen is Kondo 2227 held at the Herbarium of Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Hiroshima University. Isotype specimens, those that are duplicates of the holotype, were distributed to several herbaria, including those at the University of North Carolina, the New York Botanical Garden, the National Herbarium of New South Wales, and the Queensland Herbarium. The species was only known from a single location, the description of which vaguely positioned it along the Finniss River, a river that is nearly long. Tsang died in 1984 and it was feared that the exact location of the known population was lost with him. Further field studies, however, produced several new sites. Its alliance with the D. petiolaris complex in subgenus Lasiocephala was suspected from its earliest description by Peter Tsang, who noted similarities in their dormant bud and root structures. This assessment has been confirmed by further analysis by other botanists. Cultivation Drosera falconeri was first cultivated by Peter Tsang shortly after its initial discovery. He then sent living specimens on to others to establish the new species in cultivation. It is considered to be a difficult species to grow in cultivation. During its seasonal dormancy, D. falconeri produces a tight rosette of leaves that resembles a hibernating bud. It is often grown in a peat:sand or perlite soil. Plants can be vegetatively propagated by submerging leaf pullings in pure water. Under the Australian botanist Allen Lowrie's growing conditions, species in subgenus Lasiocephala grow year-round without dormancy. Lowrie also notes that these species produce deep red foliage in the wild, a characteristic that is lost in cultivation when plants retain a greener appearance presumably caused by lower light intensities.

History Originally named Beth Israel School of Nursing, the school was founded in 1902 to train nurses for the nascent Beth Israel Hospital (now Mount Sinai Beth Israel). Very quickly, the demand for services at Beth Israel Hospital grew and the recruitment of nurses rapidly became a necessity. The school's foundation reflected a historical national movement in nursing: that nurses in ‚Äútraining‚Äù also provided ‚Äúservice‚Äù at the hospital. Soon thereafter, in 1904, the school was chartered by the New York Board of Regents as an educational institution.PBISN: A Nursing School for the New Century Beth Israel ‚ÄîHebrew for \\"House of Israel\\"‚Äî was founded on May 28, 1890.

He was a member of the Guayaquil Group of the 1930s, who used social realism in their writings. He used magical realism in his masterpiece Siete lunas y siete serpientes (1970), which was translated into English as Seven Serpents and Seven Moons by Gregory Rabassa in 1979. Biography Aguilera Malta was born on May 24, 1909 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He was the son of Demetrio Aguilera S√°nchez and Teresa Malta y Franco. His father officially named him Demetrio Abdon but his mother hated the name Abdon and called him always Ra√∫l Demetrio. He stopped using Ra√∫l on the advice of Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara. His father was a businessman who owned factories and farms. His maternal great-grandfather, Juan Jos√© de Malta y Salcedo, was a playwright, and the young Aguilera Malta discovered his works in the library he inherited from his grandfather. Aguilera Malta spent much of his childhood on his family's farm on an island in the Gulf of Guayaquil. He was home-schooled by his mother and tutors. He went to high school at Vicente Rocafuerte School, from which he graduated in 1929. Jos√© de la Cuadra was his literature teacher. At the beginning of his college education, he studied law in Guayaquil, but he quit these studies in 1931. Later, he studied literature on a Ministry of Education scholarship in Ecuador and in Madrid, just before the start of the Spanish Civil War. Among other posts, Aguilera Malta was Undersecretary of Education and charge d'affaires in the Ecuadorian Embassy in Chile in 1947 under the government of Carlos Julio Arosemena Tola. Later, he was Cultural Attache in Brazil in 1949 and Ambassador of Ecuador to Mexico from August 1979 until his death in 1981. He held conferences and courses at several universities in North and South America, including Claremont Colleges and the University of California, Irvine. He was a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War. He worked for the journals La Prensa and El Tel√©grafo in Guayaquil. He also worked for the Panamanian journals El Diario de Panam√°, El Gr√°fico, and La Estrella de Panam√°. Aguilera Malta is considered one of the most important Ecuadorian writers. He was a founding member of the Casa de la Cultura (House of Ecuadorian Culture) and of the Guayaquil Group (together with his best friend Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara), of the Iberoamerican Community of Writers, and of the Latin American House of Culture. His books have been published around the world and translated into several languages. Aguilera Malta moved to Mexico in 1958. He had one son, Ciro, with his first love. With his wife, the Panamanian Adda Rosa Endara he had two daughters, Adda Teresa and Marlene. He was with Velia Marqu√©s since 1950, but they had no children. Aguilera Malta suffered from diabetes and blindness since the early eighties. He died on December 29, 1981 in Mexico City, due to a stroke after a fall. Awards In the 1930 Art Salon, he won two awards. In 1971, he received a gold medal from the Municipality of Guayaquil during the Latin American Writers Meeting. He was awarded the Eugenio Espejo Prize in 1981 in recognition of his outstanding literary career.

He acted, along with Oliver St. John, as co-counsel for John Hampden in the ship money case. He sat in the House of Commons between 1640 and 1642 and supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. He was attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, being knighted in 1643. He also published legal tracts.Lee, Sidney (1903), Dictionary of National Biography Index and Epitome p. 629. Biography Holborne was the son of Nicholas Holbone of Chichester. His mother was, perhaps, Anne, sister of John Lane.Archbold, citing: cp. Gen. Misc. et Herald. 2nd ser. i. 179. Holborne was married (1630-3) to the Lady Anne Dudley, granddaughter of the famous Earl of Leicester. Lady Anne was one of the abandoned daughters and co-heirs of Sir Robert Dudley, formally of Kenilworth Castle, Warwickshire. It has been suggested this relationship may have influenced his initial anti-Court reputation. He was trained for the law, as the custom then was, at Furnival's Inn, before proceeding to Lincoln's Inn, where he entered 9 November 1615, and subsequently became a bencher and reader in English law there. He was early distinguished in practice at the king's bench,Archbold, citing: ef. Hist. Mss. Comm. Ap. to 4th Rep. p. 26. and his opinion was taken by John Hampden in regard to ship-money. In the great case he was one of Hampden's counsel, and supplied what Oliver St John had omitted in an elaborate argument which lasted for three days, 2‚Äì5 December 1637.Archbold, citing: cf. Gardiner Hist. viii. 274. In April 1640 Holborne was elected Member of Parliament for Southwark in the Short Parliament. In November 1640, he was elected MP for St. Michael, Cornwall, in the Long Parliament. While in the house he spoke strongly in favour of the power of convocation to bind the laity, in so far as the canons did not conflict with the law of the land.Archbold, DNB, 27.111 Holborne separated himself still further from his party by the fight he made against Strafford's attainder. When King Charles I went to Oxford, Holborne joined him there, and on 7 February 1642 was created D.C.L. while he was disabled from sitting in the parliament at Westminster in 1642. The King made him attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, and on 19 January 1643 he was knighted. His estate was sequestrated by Parliament.Archbold, citing: Hist. MSS. Comm. Ap. to 5th Rep, p. 87. He died in 1647, and was buried in Lincoln's Inn Chapel on 16 February of that year.Archbold, DNB, 27.111 Bibliography Holborne wrote: # The Reading in Lincolnes Inne, Feb. 28 1041, vpon the Statute . . . of Treasons, Oxford, 1642, 4to: reiessued with Bacon's 'Cases' in 1681. # The Freeholders Grand Inquest touching our souveraigne Lord the King and his Parliament, London, 1647, 4to; a pamphlet upon constitutional questions.

Provisions The Act gives consumers certain rights, including increasing their ability to choose where to shop and the right to have a copy of their own contact lens prescription. It also imposed certain responsibilities on lens prescribers and sellers, and required the Federal Trade Commission to develop and enforce implementing rules, which it did in July 2004. The Act extended to contact lens wearers rights similar to those enjoyed by eyeglass wearers for 25 years before the adoption of the Act, especially in relation to ensuing competition in the market. The Act reduced barriers to retail competition, driving down prices for consumers (and improving ocular health because consumers are more apt to replace lenses more frequently). Under the Rule issued by the FTC, contact lens prescribers - defined as anyone permitted under state law to issue prescriptions for contact lenses, which include ophthalmologists, optometrists, and licensed opticians who are permitted under state law to fit contact lenses (sometimes called dispensing opticians) must give a copy of the contact lens prescription to the patient at the end of the contact lens fitting, even if the patient doesn't ask for it. Prescribers must also provide or verify the contact lens prescription to anyone who designated to act on behalf of the patient, including contact lens sellers. Prescribers are also barred from requiring patients to buy contact lenses, pay additional fees, sign waivers or releases in exchange for a copy of their prescription, or disclaim liability or responsibility for the accuracy of an eye examination. Contention Prescribers may, within the law, require patients to buy contact lenses prior to prescribing, skirting the intent of the legislation, giving the prescriber at least one lens sale per year, or whenever a patient runs out of contacts, whichever is later, as prescriptions are only good for a year. Another concern a prescriber may exclaim is that they don't want to be liable for any defects in contacts provided by a third party, however the law specifically disclaims that liability. Legislative history The Act was introduced in the House of Representatives of the 108th Congress as H.R. 3140. Its long title is An act to provide for availability of contact lens prescriptions to patients, and for other purposes. It passed the House on November 19, 2003, and passed the Senate on November 20, 2003, and was enacted when President George W. Bush signed it into law on December 6, 2003 as ). It took effect on February 4, 2004. The Federal Trade Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking appeared in the Federal Register on 4 February 2004, and FTC accepted comments from various organizations through 5 April 2004. Comments received by FTC included contentions over the stipulation relating to the time in which a prescriber needs to verify a lens prescription.. The final ruling on the law was released by the FTC in July 2004. In October 2004, the FTC released a A Guide for Prescribers and Sellers. The Act followed a surge in the use of contact lenses by Americans, which had been increasing ever since soft contact lenses became commercially available. The Act also followed a 1997 investigation by 17 state attorneys general that found that purchasers of contact lenses from eye care practitioners had no fewer ocular health problems than purchasers of contact lenses from other sources.

She is remembered as one of the pioneers of the workers' education movement in the United States and as a prolific author on the theme of trade union education. Biography=Early years Fannia Mary Cohn was born on April 5, 1885 to an ethnic Jewish family in Kletsk, Belarus, then part of the Russian empire.Daniel Katz, All Together Different: Yiddish Socialists, Garment Workers, and the Labor Roots of Multiculturalism. New York: New York University Press, 2011; pg. 49. She was the fourth of five children of a successful owner of a flour mill and his wife.Huey B. Long and Constance Lawry, \\"Fannia Mary Cohn: An Educational Leader in Labor and Workers' Education, Her Life and Times,\\" in Rae Wahl Rohfeld (ed.), Breaking New Ground: The Development of Adult and Workers' Education in North America. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Kellogg Project, Nov. 1990; pp. 174-192. Fannia received an education in private schools,Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 44. with her parents encouraging their daughter to read extensively. Cohn was radicalized during her teenaged years in the Tsarist empire. At the age of 16 she joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR), the intellectual successor of the Narodnik movement of the 1870s. She was active in the Minsk section of the PSR, a secret revolutionary political party, for the next three years. Emigration to America In 1904 her brother was nearly killed in an anti-Jewish pogrom, spurring Fannia to emigrate to the United States.Annelise Orleck, Common Sense and a Little Fire: Women and Working-Class Politics in the United States, 1900-1965. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1995; pg. 23. Arriving in New York City, Cohn soon joined the Socialist Party of America. Cohn decided against further formal education in 1905, instead taking a job as a garment worker in order to participate directly in the Yiddish-language labor movement of New York City. In 1906 Cohn began her efforts to organize workers in the white goods trade. Organizing this particular trade was difficult because workers within it were of various nationalities and spoke different languages. During a 1908 strike of household linen makers, Cohn met Rose Schneiderman, with whom she became closely associated. Both Cohn and Schneiderman believed in the efficacy of recruiting female strike leaders from the union rank-and-file rather than relying upon a male-dominated centralized union bureaucracy for the settlement of labor disputes. They employed this outlook to bridge the ethnic gaps amongst worker in the white goods trade, finding a leader amongst the women of different ethnicities who could speak to the workers in their own language and cultivating her organizing talents. This strategy was successful and by 1909 the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) recognized the white goods' worker's union. Cohn helped to organize Local 41 of the ILGWU in Brooklyn and was elected to the Executive Board of the local in 1909 at the young age of 24.Katz, All Together Different, pg. 48. She was elected Chair of the Executive Board in 1913 and remained in that position until 1914. During the years 1912 and 1913 Cohn played a prominent role as a leader of the strike movement of New York City's organized garment workers. In 1914 the National Women's Trade Union League (NWTUL), an organization established in 1903, launched a training school for women organizers, a year-long program combining academics and field work. New York ILGWU leader Cohn was one of the first three chosen to attend the program in Chicago. In 1915, she was asked by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union to organize Chicago dressmakers and in doing so founded ILGWU Local No. 59.Marie Tedesco, \\"Fannia Cohn,\\" in Gary M. Fink (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pg. 159. In connection with this activity, Cohn was a key leader of a major strike of Chicago garment workers which began late in 1915 and continued into the following year, serving as a general organizer for the ILGWU. In 1916 Cohn was elected as the first female vice president of the ILGWU. She would serve in this capacity until 1925. Workers' education In 1918 Cohn took the leadership of the ILGWU's Education Committee, and eventually rose to become Vice President of the union. After being elected as the first female vice president of ILGWU, Fannia Cohn continued to pioneer and promote an image of the labor movement that integrated education as well as personal growth.\\"Guide to the ILGWU Education Department Fannia Cohn papers,\\" Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives, Cornell University Library, Ithaca, NY. Collection 5780/049. Cohn, soon after her promotion, lobbied for the establishment of an Education Department within the union and subsequently, served as secretary upon its launch. In the wake of this new educational reform, women within the union began to militantly mobilize due to their growing discontent with the ILGWU leadership and in turn, jumpstarted a rebellion that consequently crippled the union‚Äôs infrastructure. As a result, Fannia Cohn would be blamed for this rebellion as well as her failure to condemn it and would thus be castigated and ostracized from all fronts ‚Äì including the militants she inspired. Cut off by union leaders, Cohn later channelled her activism into education, as she fostered some of the country's prominent scholars as allies and even teachers in her workers education courses.Eric Arnesen, Encyclopedia of US Labor and Working- Class History. New York: Routledge, 2007; pg. ???. Cohn was instrumental in the formation of the Workers' Education Bureau of America in 1921. Cohn was a co-founder of Brookwood Labor College in 1924, an initiative associated with labor educator A. J. Muste.Marion Dickerman and Ruth Taylor (eds.), Who's Who in Labor. New York: Dryden Press, 1946; pg. 63. She would serve as a director of Brookwood until 1933, also sitting on the board of Brookwood's Labor Publication Society, publisher of the magazine Labor Age. In 1932 Cohn was named a vice president of Brookwood Labor College, a position in which she remained until 1937. During her time at Brookwood, Cohn served as a mentor to Floria Pinkney, the first African-American labor organizer in the ILGWU. Conferences and political activity Fannia Cohn was selected as an American delegate to the International Women's Conference held in Washington, DC in 1919. She was also a delegate to the 1st International Conference on Workers' Education, held in Brussels, Belgium in 1922. She served in a similar capacity at the 2nd International Conference on Workers' Education, held in Oxford, England in 1924. In 1924 Cohn became active in the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA), a group envisioned as an umbrella organization of progressive political and trade union activists leading towards the establishment of a labor party in the United States. Cohn was elected a member of the National Committee of the CPPA. Despite the failure of that organization to survive beyond 1925, Cohn remained active in left wing politics at least through the 1940s as a member of the League for Industrial Democracy. Death and legacy Fannia Cohn retired from trade union affairs in 1961. She died in New York City on December 24, 1962. She was 77 years old at the time of her death.

Azov was built in 1826 to compensate the losses of the disastrous 1824 Saint Petersburg flood. In the same year Azov, commanded by Mikhail Lazarev, became the flagship of Admiral Login Geiden's First Mediterranean Squadron and sailed to the Aegean on a joint English-French-Russian peacekeeping mission. On October 20, 1827 Azov spearheaded the Russian squadron in the Battle of Navarino. She engaged numerous enemy ships and sustained heavy damage. After refit at Malta Azov continued her service as Geiden's flagship and enforced naval blockade of Greece and the Dardanelles. In the beginning of 1830 Azov returned to Kronstadt. By this time the ship was literally rotten owing to poor workmanship and combat damage. She was retired in the same year and broken up in 1831 after only four years in service. Five officers of Azov who fought at Navarino became admirals in the Russian Navy: captain Mikhail Lazarev, Vladimir Istomin, Vladimir Kornilov, Pavel Nakhimov and Yevfimy Putyatin. Construction 1824 Kronstadt, the main base of the Russian Baltic Fleet was swept by the disastrous flood of 1824.Andrienko, p. 31. Of 28 capital ships moored in the inner harbours of Kotlin Island, only five were spared by the flood, and only three of them were deemed safe for the open seas.Andrienko, p. 32. Twenty-two capital ships were written off and broken up. Most of them remained afloat when the flood recessed, but were too rotten to be worth salvaging. Alexander I saw no need to resurrect the fleet to its past strength, and in 1825 the shipyards of Arkhangelsk laid down only two new ships: Azov and Ezekiel.Andrienko, p. 44. Azov was laid down in November by master shipwright Andrey Kurochkin (1770‚Äì1842). By 1825 Kurochkin has practically retired from active work, and construction was managed by his associate Vasily Yershov (1781‚Äì1860). Mikhail Lazarev, the captain of Azov, supervised construction on site since February 1826. Lazarev brought forward numerous amendments to the original design; 22 of them materialized in Azov. Azov was launched in June 1826 and in the autumn sailed to its base in Kronstadt.Andrienko, p. 65. The ship was hailed as the best in Russian Navy and served as a class model for eleven ships built in 1826‚Äì1826. Its inner plan was improved compared to previous ships, and its exterior was fitted out to a flagship standard. Azov's brief career proved that all these improvements could not compensate for the lack of quality timber and poor workmanship: the former flagship completely rotted in four years of active service. Service=Kronstadt to Navarino Mikhail Lazarev, captain of Azov in 1826-1827. In the spring of 1827 Nicholas authorized a brief full-scale exercise of the Baltic Fleet, a last-minute review of available forces before committing them to his Greek project. The fleet consisted of nine ships of the line, eight frigates and four lesser ships. Admiral Dmitry Senyavin raised his flag on the Azov and sailed out to the Baltic on 1827.Andrienko, p. 68. Five days later the fleet returned to Kronstadt. 1827 Senyavin received a top secret order: he had to lead the whole fleet to Portsmouth, England.Andrienko, p. 70. Upon receiving further heads-up from the Russian ambassador in London Senyavin had to split his fleet in two squadrons. Four ships of the line, four frigates and two brigs of Senyavin's choice would form the new First Mediterranean Squadron, with Login Geiden in command, and proceed to the Mediterranean immediately.Andrienko, p. 71. In the evening of , when the fleet was still in Kronstadt, Nicholas personally visited Azov and literally pushed the fleet into the sea.Andrienko, p. 76. Azov left Kronstadt with the tsar on board at around 5 a.m. in the morning; in the afternoon he boarded his yacht and returned to Saint Petersburg. The fleet sailed forward, reaching Reval on , Bornholm on , Copenhagen on .Andrienko, pp. 77-78. Azov and older Gangut proved themselves good seagoers as opposed to heavy and slow Alexander Nevsky and Emmanuel.Andrienko, p. 80. Winds in the Danish straits delayed the voyage, and the fleet arrived in Portsmouth only on . As soon as his ships lined up in the Solent, Senyavin received the news that England, France and Russia have just signed the Treaty of London.Andrienko, p. 84. On Senyavin boarded Tsar Constantine and Geiden raised his flag on Azov. The First Mediterranean Squadron, led by Azov, became operational.Andrienko, p. 90. Sailing south-west to Cape St. Vincent was quick, but then the squadron ran into strong headwinds. It reached Sicily on . On the same day Azov suffered its first two casualties: a sailor fell overboard, midshipman Domashnenko jumped down to rescue him, both drowned.Andrienko, p. 92. Geiden lost two more weeks in sailing to Messina to meet with Russian diplomats.Andrienko, p. 93. At last on the Russian squadron met the British force of Admiral Edward Codrington south of Zakynthos.Andrienko, p. 94. On the same day the combined fleet was joined by the French squadron of Admiral Henri de Rigny.Andrienko, p. 96. According to Geiden's reports, the unusually smooth rendezvous was purely accidental.Andrienko, p. 97. On the next day the French left for refit; the English and Russian ships sailed south to Methoni and blocked the entrance into the Navarino harbor, the anchorage of the combined Turkish-Egyptian fleet.Andrienko, p. 104. Azov and the British flagship HMS Asia took their stations side-by-side, and the two admirals regularly spoke to each other.Andrienko, p. 105. De Rigny returned on , which brought the strength of allied fleet to ten ships of the line, nine frigates and four lesser ships.Andrienko, p. 119. The three admirals decided to enter the harbor in strength and force the Turks and the Egyptians to accept the terms of the Treaty of London.Andrienko, p. 108. De Rigny and Geiden agreed to obey Codrington, as senior in command, for the whole period of the standoff. Battle of Navarino Order of battle, according to Russian sources. Azov (marked a) is in the center of the allied arc of ships. At about 11 a.m. of a change of wind allowed Codrington to order the move into the harbor.Andrienko, p. 129. It was agreed that the English and Russian squadrons enter the harbor in parallel lines, followed by the French. At about 1 p.m. Codrington, cautious about the narrow entrance into the harbor, changed the plan and signaled orders to take formation in a single line.Andrienko, p. 130. The allied fleet took position in an arc side-by-side with the Turkish fleet. Azov headed to its planned position at the very center of the allied arc, with the rest of the Russian fleet to its port, the English and French battleships to its starboard, and the English frigates in the rear.Andrienko, p. 130. Soon the Turks fired at a British cutter, killing lieutenant Fitzroy and igniting an all-out naval battle.Andrienko, p. 131. Sources disagree on exact timing of events owing to different timekeeping practices and the confusion of the battle; the first shots were marked at either 2:00, 2:20 or even 2:45 p.m.; ship log of Azov recorded them at 2:30.Andrienko, p. 134. At this moment Azov was still on the move to its planned station and had just escaped the firing range of Turkish coastal artillery.Andrienko, p. 136. The smoke of English- Turkish shootout obstructed their view to starboard; Azov fired its first shots to port at 2:45.Andrienko, p. 137. At 3 p.m. Azov reached its destination, folded her sails and dropped her anchors.Andrienko, pp. 137, 144. Lazarev intended to fight next to HMS Albion, the leftmost ship of the British squadron. To evade heavy smoke that completely blocked the view, Azov dropped anchor to the port of its place in the line. The maneuver created a gap between Azov and Albion, wide enough to fit four Turkish frigates. Eventually they encircled Azov and Albion and both ships suffered abnormally high damage.Andrienko, p. 145. Geiden noted that for a certain 22-minute interval Azov was engaged by eight enemy ships.Andrienko, p. 152. Azov is a large ship on the left of the Battle of Navarino painting by Ivan Aivazovsky. Although Azov was taking hits from different enemy ships, Lazarev concentrated his gunfire on a single target, a 76-gun ship of the line that had earlier engaged Albion. By 3:30 p.m. the enemy ship lost all masts and dropped out of the line.Andrienko, p. 146. The gap was filled by a two-deck frigate under the flag of Tahir Pasha. At about 4:00 p.m. another frigate, moored next to Tahir's flagship, exploded and disrupted the enemy line of battle. A sudden opportunity allowed Azov to fire both broadsides at point-blank range, and in a short time she sank two frigates and a corvette. Still, Azov remained in an extremely dangerous position. At 4:30 it was relieved by the arrival of the French Breslau, which filled the gap between Azov and Albion and whose first salvo destroyed an Egyptian frigate that fired at Azov. For the remainder of the battle Azov and Breslau fought together, engaging enemy ships one by one.Andrienko, p. 148. Tahir's frigate returned fire until at least 5:30 p.m. and managed to knock down Azov's third mast; it lost five out of six hundred men and was abandoned.Andrienko, p. 147. Shortly before 6 p.m. Azov ceased fire: all enemy ships within its reach were destroyed or forced to beach.Andrienko, p. 158. Azov's own losses (24 sailors killed, 6 officers and 61 sailors wounded) were the highest among the Russian ships.Andrienko, p. 165. Likewise, the English and French flagships suffered the highest casualties of their squadrons. Damage and repairs Damage sustained at Navarino Physical damage to Azov was also the highest: 153 penetrating cannonball hits, seven of them below the water line, and practically destroyed rigging.Andrienko, p. 176. Geiden mobilized 176 carpenters from other ships to assist repairs of Azov, which took three days. By the end of it was deemed safe for short sea travel. On the next day the Russian and English ships left the harbor for Malta.Andrienko, p. 179. The battered Russian fleet, unable to keep pace with Codrington, proceeded with utmost caution and entered the harbor of Valletta on .Andrienko, p. 180. It turned out that practically all masts on the Russian ships needed replacement. Azov, as a flagship, received the replacement masts right from the Admiralty of Valletta but the other ships had to order masts from England, which took months.Andrienko, p. 186. Azov was slowly repaired by its own crew in the harbor; on 1828 it was towed into the Admiralty dockyards, had its masts replaced, and returned to harbor on .Andrienko, p. 187. The Russians were more than satisfied with the workmanship of local repair crews, but the rigging supplied from the Admiralty was too old and dry, prone to unexpected snapping, and had to be replaced at first opportunity.Andrienko, p. 189. At about the same time a courier from Saint Petersburg delivered awards for the Battle of Navarino. The captain of Azov, Mikhail Lazarev, was promoted to rear admiral; Lazarev and lieutenants Pavel Nakhimov (the future admiral) and Ivan Butenev (who lost his arm in the battle) were awarded the Order of St. George.Andrienko, p. 190. In March 1828 the crew of Azov was awarded a special Flag of St. George.Andrienko, p. 191. Nicholas decreed that after Azov's retirement the Russian Navy must perpetually have a ship named Pamyat Azova (–ü–∞–º—è—Ç—å –ê–∑–æ–≤–∞, The Memory of Azov), thus the name Azov was effectively retired. Anchorage at Valletta was a boon for career officers, but the conditions for conscripted sailors, locked in the holds or engaged in hard work, were atrocious.Andrienko, p. 193. The crew of Alexander Nevsky openly revolted and was promptly suppressed by Geiden. He court-martialled sixteen men for hard work in Siberia; in January‚ÄìMarch 1828 they were locked on board the Azov and then sent back to Russia.Andrienko, p. 194. Azov's own records bear only a slight hint of sailors' discontentment. Naval blockade Present-day photo of Poros harbor, the Russian base in 1828-1829. Instructions received by Geiden advised him to continued physical separation of the Turkish-Egyptian ships from Greek mainland. However, the conclusion of the Treaty of Turkmenchay clearly indicated that the Russian Empire prepared for an open war with Turkey. On 1828 Azov and the rest of the Russian squadron pulled out of Valletta harbor and headed back to Navarino.Andrienko, p. 257. Geiden left a small force of frigates there and took Azov and Constantine into the Archipelago (his two other capital ships were damaged in a freak collision and retired to Zakynthos for repairs).This was the only recorded collision of the Mediterranean campaign - Andrienko, p. 271. On Azov rendezvoused with the French squadron at Milo; De Rigny politely visited Azov. Four days later Azov rendezvoused with Ioannis Kapodistrias near Hydra island.Kapodistria traveled on board the Russian frigate Yelena. Geiden and Kapodistrias planned to meet at Nafplion but an outbreak of plague compelled them to meet at sea. - Andrienko, p. 271. In May Geiden moved the fleet to its new base at Poros.Andrienko, p. 273. The Turks rushed their diplomats and Orthodox bishops to Azov with assurances of peace and compliance, all in vain: on Geiden received the news that Nicholas I had declared war with Turkey.Andrienko, p. 277. For the next two months Azov engaged mostly in diplomacy, carrying Geiden and the Greek officials to meet with De Rigny at Zakynthos and with the new British commander Sir Pulteney Malcolm at Sapientza.Andrienko, p. 297. In the end of August the allied fleet sailed for a joint blockade of Greece; the English and French blocked Methoni and Koroni, the Russians closed the entrance to Navarino harbor. The blockade compelled Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt to evacuate his troops from Greece.Andrienko, p. 298. The officers of Azov supervised loading of Egyptian transports and found a large number of Greek women boarding along with their Arab masters; when questioned, the majority of these women indeed preferred to go to Egypt.Andrienko, p. 300. According to Andrienko, Geiden deliberately stayed aside from any decisive action and left the land phase of the operation to the French.Andrienko, p. 304. Geiden was obsessed with the upcoming blockade of the Dardanelles and rushed to Malta as soon as was possible ( 1828) to refit Azov and the rest of his squadron and to rendezvous with the Second Mediterranean Squadron of Admiral Pyotr Rikord.Andrienko, p. 309. Indeed, Rikord (but not the whole of his squadron) was there, and on the two admirals convened a large War Council on board of Azov.Andrienko, p. 335. Rikord's force sailed out to the Dardanelles; Azov began the long overdue repairs. On Azov and Alexandra sailed out into the Aegean and were caught in a disastrous storm that destroyed many ships all over Europe but spared the Russians.Andrienko, p. 351. Azov anchored at Poros, then hosting a multilateral diplomatic convention, and continued its repairs. She stayed in Poros until April 1829, when Geiden received intelligence that the Turks planned to break the blockade of the Dardanelles in strength. On 1829 Azov and the rest of Geiden's ships joined Rikord at Tenedos.Andrienko, p. 376. The British, French, Dutch and Austrian forces were already there, but the Turks did not show up.All of Pulteney Malcolm's fleet, four French ships-of-the- line, two Dutch ships, one Austrian frigate - Andrienko, p. 378. In June 1829 another rumor, that of Egyptian forces assembling in Alexandria, caused another all-out movement of the international fleet, again with no result.Andrienko, p. 392. In July Azov represented the Russian Empire at the Greek National Assembly in Nafplion.Andrienko, p. 394. In September it again sailed to Tenedos, only to learn that the Russian and Ottoman Empires had signed an armistice.Andrienko, p. 406. Demise and legacy Memory of Azov Egg by jeweller Peter Carl Faberg√©, with a miniature replica of the cruiser Memory of Azov, named so after original Azov On 1829 Geiden split his force. Lazarev assumed command over Azov, Ezekiel, Constantine, Alexander Nevsky, four frigates, one corvette and two brigs.Andrienko, p. 414. One month later the fleet received orders to return to Kronstadt, leaving a small observation force behind. Lazarev sailed out of Poros to Malta on 1830. The voyage from Malta to Kronstadt took 59 days and could be perfectly uninspiring had it not been for the order to reach Kronstadt on May 1. The urgency forced Lazarev to cross the Baltic when it was still icy, and Azov lost around 200 copper lining sheets in collisions with ice.Andrienko, p. 433. Azov reached Kronstadt on 1830. After less than four years at sea she was rotten beyond salvage. Constantine and Vladimir were just as bad. Lazarev complained that \\"our ships are not worth the paint [wasted on them]\\".Russian: \\"C—Ç–æ—è—Ç –ª–∏ –Ω–∞—à–∏ –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª–∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—å –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∫–∏?\\" - Andrienko, p. 446. Later historians argued that Azov was written off for its combat damage, but Lazarev himself did not mention it at all.Andrienko, p. 446. Azov was examined in drydock and condemned in the autumn of 1830 and broken up in 1831. Her twin Ezekiel, built in the same year by the same yard, sailed for ten more years.Andrienko, p. 447. The older Gangut, converted into a steamer, served until 1891; the small 16-gun brig Achilles, built in Sveaborg in 1819, served until the 1960s.Andrienko, p. 450. The Imperial Navy had three ships named after Azov - the 86-gun Pamyat Azova (1831, broken up in 1854); the 74-gun Pamyat Azova (1848, broken up in 1863); and the protected cruiser Pamyat Azova (1890, sunk in 1919). Modern Russian Navy has a project 775M landing ship named Azov (built in 1990). CitationsReferences * Andrienko, V. G. (2002, in Russian) Do i posle Navarina (–î–æ –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –ù–∞–≤–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞).

It aired on CBS in the United States on March 9, 2010. In the episode, the firm defends an attorney charged with murder for allegedly providing a witness list to his drug dealer client, which resulted in the death of a federal witness. Meanwhile, Peter grows jealous of Alicia's relationship with Will, and an anonymous Twitter user is making disparaging posts about Alicia. The episode was written by Amanda Segel and directed by Rosemary Rodriguez. It marked the second in a string of guest appearances by Alan Cumming as Eli Gold, a cutthroat political operative whom several commentators said closely resembled White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Ana Gasteyer, a comedian best known from her work on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, also appears as Judge Patrice Lessner. Plot With the Stern, Lockhart & Gardner firm in dire financial straits, Diane (Christine Baranski) and Will (Josh Charles) consult an efficiency expert about cuts that would help them avoid layoffs. Will calls Alicia (Julianna Margulies), but she left her phone at the apartment and he reaches Peter (Chris Noth) instead, resulting in an awkward moment between them. Alicia and Cary (Matt Czuchry) are visiting the offices of Eric Dorfman (Boris McGiver), a lawyer with whom their firm is discussing a case merger. In the middle of their discussion, federal agents arrive and arrest Dorfman for first degree murder. Assistant United States Attorney Harrison Rivers (Sharif Atkins) claims Dorfman gave the name of a federal witness to his client, drug kingpin Lemond Bishop (Mike Colter), resulting in her murder. Dorfman asks that Stern, Lockhart & Gardner defend him, but Will and Diane are hesitant due to fears that Dorfman cannot pay. However, when Rivers attempts to intimidate Will away from the case, Will decides on the spot to take it out of pride. Alicia and Peter, who remains restless due to his house arrest, find they are getting along better. However, while searching for old tax forms in Alicia's room, Peter finds condoms in her bedside table and suspects she is sleeping with Will. An argument ensues when he confronts her about it, ending with Alicia angrily insisting that he will have to trust her. Meanwhile, political operative Eli Gold (Alan Cumming) tells Peter an anonymous Twitter user named \\"Upriser7\\" who is making disparaging posts about Alicia, some of which are true, including that Alicia and Peter are sleeping in separate rooms. When Eli later realizes the Tweets are coming from inside their house, Alicia questions whether it is her children, but they deny it. When Alicia learns her son Zach (Graham Phillips) communicates with his girlfriend Becca (Dreama Walker) with Twitter, they realize she is Upriser7, and Eli Gold confronts her at school and intimidates her into stopping the Tweets. Later, Bishop offers the firm $200,000 in cash as a retainer to serve as his lawyer, prompting Diane and Will to weigh the ethics of defending Bishop against the firm's desperate financial need. While working on the case, Alicia realizes Dorfman's daughter Tammy (Katie Kreisler) gave the witness list to Bishop to win her father's approval. Dorfman insists he will go to jail before letting his daughter take the fall, but instead calls Bishop and threatens to give up information about him. In response, Bishop has his bodyguard Tony Grustelle (Creighton James) confess to the murder, which results in Dorfman's case getting thrown out, much to Rivers' ire. Bishop announces he is dropping Stern, Lockhart & Gardner because he prefers Dorfman. Diane and Will decide to seek a third partner with an extensive client list to keep the firm alive. The episode ends with Becca asking to have sex with Zach. Although the condoms he kept in his mother's bedside table are now missing, he leaves with Becca anyway. Production \\"Fleas\\" was written by Amanda Segel and directed by Rosemary Rodriguez. The subplot involving Twitter addressed the growing popularity and influence of the blogosphere, demonstrating how even unsubstantiated claims and gossip on social networking sites can trickle into the public consciousness and eventually the mainstream media. The cutbacks and financial difficulties facing Stern, Lockhart & Gardner were also reflective of the global recession affecting much of the industrialized world at the time the episode first broadcast. The episode derives its title from a line in which Harrison Rivers accuses Will of being complicit with the criminals he is defending, claiming, \\"You wake up with fleas, counselor.\\" \\"Fleas\\" marked the second in a string of guest appearances by Alan Cumming as Eli Gold, a political operative said to be based on White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Both are political operatives from Chicago noted for bullying tactics and their use of foul language. \\"Fleas\\" also included an appearance by Ana Gasteyer, a comedian best known from her work on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Gasteyer portrayed Judge Patrice Lessner, who presides over the Eric Dorfman case and displays animosity toward Will. Cultural references \\"Fleas\\" makes extensive use of Twitter, a social-networking and microblogging service in which users can make posts of up to 140 characters on a profile page. While discussing possible cuts at the firm, Will is disappointed when it is suggested he lose his season tickets to the Chicago Cubs, a baseball team with the Major League Baseball's National League. Eli Gold warns Becca if he does not stop her Tweets, the result will be similar to the 2009 horror film Drag Me to Hell, in which a young girl is tormented by demons. Reception Blake Meredith of the Los Angeles Times called \\"Fleas\\" a \\"solid if not enthralling installment\\", but felt it was \\"a little heavy on the courtroom drama\\". He complimented the timeliness of the Twitter subplot and particularly praised the confrontation scene between Eli Gold and Becca, which he said \\"was so satisfying, I may have watched it twice\\".

Biography Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara was born in Guayaquil in 1909, the son of Emma Lara Calderon and Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Del Campo (1873‚Äì1910) who founded a newspaper called \\"El Caustico\\" in 1895, which was satirical in nature and pro-Eloy Alfaro. Besides being a journalist, his father also wrote poems, which his wife Emma published after his death in a book called Mis Recuerdos (1912), which contained two poems dedicated to his son Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara: \\"A mi primogenito\\" and \\"El primer diente\\". Despite being crippled, Lara fought as a militant communist and intellectual in Ecuador. He participated in street battles and blockades, with the help of a friend who carried him on his shoulders and acted as his legs. He never attended school and was completely self-taught.Biography of Joaquin Gallegos Lara (in Spanish) He spoke French, German, Italian, and Russian almost perfectly.The Encyclopedia of Ecuador - GALLEGOS LARA, Joaqu√≠n (in Spanish) He started writing poems at about 10 years old, when he found out of the suicide death of Medardo √Ångel Silva (1898‚Äì1919). Lara's early poems include \\"Al Potro\\", \\"Vieja Despedida\\", and \\"Mam√°-Jij√≠\\" (a character in his novel Las Cruces Sobre el Agua), among others. These poems were published in the literary magazines \\"P√°ginas Selectas\\", \\"Variedades\\", \\"Letras y N√∫meros\\", \\"Cosmos\\", and \\"Ilustraci√≥n\\". Years later his poetry took on a social and political view, such as \\"Poemas de Miss Ecuador\\" (dedicated to Sarita Chac√≥n Z√∫√±iga, the first Miss Ecuador), \\"Bandera Roja\\", \\"Film Ferroviario\\", \\"Romance de la rural\\", and \\"Guayas\\", which were published in newspapers such as La Prensa, El Tel√©grafo, and Bandera Roja (the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Ecuador). Many of his stories were collected in Las Cruces Sobre el Agua, a novel published in 1946, which he wrote in pencil 5 years earlier at the age of 21. Two other works, \\"Los Guandos\\" and \\"La Bruja,\\" were published posthumously. In 1930, he wrote the collection of short stories Los Que Se Van, together with Demetrio Aguilera Malta and Enrique Gil Gilbert.Gallegos Lara, Joaqu√≠n (1909-1947) He was part of the \\"Guayaquil Group\\" (a group of authors who used social realism in their writing) and played an active role in leftist politics. In 1947, shortly before his death, he published the book of short stories La Ultima Erranza. In 1952, his Biograf√≠a del Pueblo Indio (completed in 1936) was published, and in 1956 another book of his stories was published. Work as a literary critic Lara wrote literary criticism and commentary, and wrote the prologues to books such as Estatuas en el mar (1946) by Rafael D√≠az Ycaza, Las huellas de una raza (1941) by Marco Antonio Lamota, and Tierra, son, y tambor (1945) by Adalberto Ortiz, among others.

Personal life In 1935, Lara, 26, married Nela Mart√≠nez Espinosa, 21, in Ambato. The marriage ended in divorce, but they remained friends throughout their lives. Lara left an unfinished novel titled Guandos when he died in 1947; Nela Martinez completed the book and it was published in 1982. Both writers are credited as the authors of Guandos Awards and honors On October 4, 1944 Lara was awarded the Gold Medal from the Municipality of Guayaquil for his patriotic journalism. Death In the beginning of 1947, Lara fell ill as the consequence of a fistula. Doctors tried to cure him with various treatments to no avail.

It was composed of five main writers: Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara, Enrique Gil Gilbert, Demetrio Aguilera Malta, Jos√© de la Cuadra, and Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco. Their works aimed to portray \\"social realism\\" as a form of displaying the real Ecuadorian montubio and cholo. The group eventually disintegrates after the death of two of their writers, Jos√© de la Cuadra and Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara, the inactivity in literature by Enrique Gil Gilbert, and the long trips away from Ecuador by Demetrio Aguilera Malta and Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco in the mid 1940s.  Origins = Historical Context  Stemming from an economy impacted by the liberalization of markets, the exploitation of the lower class became a prominent consequence of the open market economy of the pre-1930s. Clashes between classes resulted in the formation of two groups, the conservatives and the liberals. For the Ecuadorian mestizo in northern Ecuador, a main concern was the declining textile industry severely affected by the British textile industry. Yet for the coast, especially in Guayaquil, the newly opened markets allowed for prosperity attributed to the increasing demand for cacao and the emergence of a new exporting class. As a result, the Ecuadorian economy found itself undergoing a \\"diversification of the regional production that came accompanied with a series of social changes that dislocated significantly the relationships between the dominant and the dominated, which was expressed in a series of regional social protests.\\" Upon the ending of the first World War, a decline in the price of cacao and a plague in plantations, commence a concern for Ecuadorians. Emphasized by the global crisis during this period, Ecuadorian officials respond with a depreciation of their currency in efforts to maintain competitiveness among their products in the global market. This thus led to increasing unemployment rates and repression that incited the discontent of the working class. With great discontent, the Ecuadorian working class found themselves participating in a general strike on November 15, 1922, which was violently repressed resulting in around 1,200 to 1,500 people dead.  Writing as a Response  For the principal writers of the Guayaquil Group, the violent repression of the strike struck a chord that remained with them until the 1930s. Their works served as a protest to the injustice carried out by those in power. In a speech, Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco discusses how the group came about: > \\"Los adolescentes y ni√±os que, ocho a√±os despu√©s, integrar√≠amos el Grupo de > Guayaquil, vimos espantados la b√°rbara matanza. Es apena obvio suponer que, > parcialmente, cuando menos, aquel hecho brutal marcarse al resoluci√≥n intima > en nosotros de crear una literatura de denuncia y protesta. Lo cual nos > condujo a poner una excesiva atenci√≥n en el mundo exterior de las relaciones > humanas. Porque, adem√°s, carec√≠amos de una ascendencia narrativa que hubiese > puesto los ojos en los problemas de la tierra.\\" \\\\- Alfredo Pareja > Diezcanseco (Guayaquil Group Writer) > \\"The adolescents and children that, eight years later, would integrate the > Guayaquil Group, saw in horror the barbarous killing. It's hardly obvious to > suppose that, partially, at least, that brutal occurrence mark the intimate > resolution within us to create a literature of denunciation and protest. Of > which led us to pay excessive attention on the world exterior to human > relationships. Because, in addition, we lacked the ascendency of a narrative > that would have put its eyes on the problems of the land.\\" \\\\- Alfredo > Pareja Diezcanseco (Guayaquil Group Writer) This was the reason for the works produced during this period being focused largely on dialogue and representing the true Ecuadorian \\"montubio\\", and \\"cholo.\\" The group came to represent the \\"first modern effort in the Ecuadorian novel that focused on the inhabitants of the coast as a source of artistic interpretation.\\" With that in mind, the writers attempted to maintain artistic sense and social conscience in a balance that would undermine one over the other. Not only were they attempting to maintain a certain balance of senses, but they wanted to somehow keep their works distanced from political labels doing so by putting an emphasis on the characters and making them something beyond stereotypes. The works focused on humanizing the \\"montubio\\" and \\"cholo\\" to the point of presenting the injustices they experienced to the reader without a lineal narrative. Yet for these writers, the name \\"Guayaquil Group\\" is not one they placed on themselves. According to Demetrio Aguilera Malta, their nation had deemed them so and after the success of the work: Los que se van (1930), they went around and outside of the country with that denomination. By 1936, the Society of Writers and Independent Artists was formed as an extension of the Guayaquil Group. Leopoldo Benites Vinueza and Abel Romeo Castillo, were among the new additions to the literary group.  Members  ;Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara was considered the spiritual guide of the group with immense intellectual capacity. He was born with a physical defect that made him use a wheelchair for most of his life. Despite his disability, he found himself working many bureaucratic jobs but during the last 10 years of his life, he worked on a cart transporting merchandise across the country from the city to the mountains. This exposed him to several groups of people where he develops friendships with montubios, giving him enough material for the novel \\"Los que se van.\\" Yet his family was of low social standing which attracted him to Marxism. As a member of the Communist Party, he felt like his experiences impeded him from writing fiction prompting him to social realism. At the age of 16, he publishes his first poems. ;Enrique Gil Gilbert The youngest member of the group. He found himself attracted to Marxism and became a militant member of the Communist Party. Publishes his first poems at the age of 16. By his counterparts, he was considered an idealist and found himself identifying with the working class despite his family being of higher social standing. He was rebellious and an active participant in the political scene throughout his college career. His activism forces him out of college thereafter leading him to traveling around Ecuador where he spent a lot of time with families in the country exposing him montubios. This gave him the necessary material to write with in his novelas, short stories, and poems. ;Demetrio Aguilera Malta Member of the Socialist Party who later abandons his political activity to focus on his writing, theatre and film. He was considered the most versatile member of the group due to his ability to manifest his works in a variety of forms like: novels, short stories, poems, theatre, sculptures, and war reports. Early on, he was active in politics and social reform. His family was of middle-class background which allowed him to travel around Ecuador with his father. This exposed him to various areas of the Ecuadorian coast where he met \\"cholos,\\" serving as the inspiration for his writing. ;Jos√© de la Cuadra Jos√© de la Cuadra was the oldest member of the group that found his death at 37 years old. He was the first to die from this group. De la Cuadra is often considered to have developed artistically throughout his career within the Guayaquil Group. He was a member of the Socialist Party. By the age of 17, he begins to publish his poems. As a lawyer, he found himself often serving \\"montubios\\" in criminal cases which exposed him to several ethnic-social groups giving him the necessary material for his writings. Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco ;Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco Considered to be the most adaptive to situations, Pareja Diezcanseco's background is aristocratic yet his family's social standing descends to middle class after his father's death. Although he was the one to receive the least amount of formal education, he was able to reach the most education by adulthood. He was also the most prolific of the group. Pareja Diezcanseco was not a part of any political party but had socialist leanings. At the age of 17, he begins writing. Most of his works are urban and demonstrate the relationship that he had with a variety of social classes.  List of Most Recognized Works  Los que se van (1930) A series of stories by Demetrio Aguilera Malta, Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara, and Enrique Gil Gilbert. Discuses themes surrounding military slavery, feudal slavery. The stories make explicit use of common vernacular noted mostly by the use of curses. Obtained international attention because it was one of the first works with contemporary prose that would set the precedence for future Ecuadorian literature. According to Karl Heise, \\"Ecuadorian literature is famous during this period due to its social emphasis, in this book, the treatment of the social phenomenons is present, but not prevalent. The authors desired to tell good stories and attempt to do them well.\\" There are no stylistic differences in this collection of stories and without the names of the authors being there it would be quite impossible to distinguish who wrote each story. The collection of stories manages to focus on three things: the environment as a physical and spiritual entity, the camaraderie within the social groups, and society in general. This work makes an attempt to capture a way of life that the authors thought was en route to going extinct, hence the need to write about montubios and cholos. Horno (1932) Written by Jos√© de la Cuadra. Made up of two editions, the first of which contains 11 stories and was published in 1932. The second edition contains 12 stories, published in 1940. Most famous work within this piece is, The Tigress, which appears only in the second edition. Themes include passion, violence, homicide, cruelty and revenge, but also the vindication of the disgraced in Ecuador. Nuestro pan (1941) Written by Enrique Gil Gilbert. Don Goyo (1933) Written by Demetrio Aguilera Malta. Emphasizes the relationship between the worker and the soil with particular symbolism found in the rice field that the \\"cholo peon\\" Cusumbo is working on. Los Sangurimas (1934) Written by de la Cuadra. It's a short story comparing a tree, the \\"matapalo,\\" to the Ecuadorian \\"montubio.\\"  Other Works  Rio Arriba (1932) El Muelle (1933) La Beldaca (1935) Baldomera (1938) Yunga (1933) Las cruces sobre el agua (1946)  Legacy  Grave of Jos√© de la Cuadra Grave of Joaqu√≠n Gallegos Lara For the writers of the Guayaquil Group, their legacy lived on in their works. Yet, during their time of writing, they didn't necessarily find themselves changing the social conditions of the time. With their writings, they had at most hoped to bring attention to the injustices carried out by those in power. The production of their works were meant as a protest that \\"hoped to awaken public indignation about the situation that was largely ignored by those in power.\\" The usage of crude themes like violence and sex, in fact, ended up alienating those that could have joined the social reform movement. For others, these stories were read for entertainment leaving those being criticized within the works feeling unaffected. At the same time, however, the stories written by the group, did manage to accelerate movement towards developing some reforms. * Monument for the writers of the Guayaquil Group, named \\"Cinco como un pu√±o.\\" Found in Guayaquil, Ecuador in the Malec√≥n References *Heise, Karl H.

In modern times, Odias started migrating to different parts of India mainly for education and jobs. There are various social and cultural organizations in various parts of the country which include Odia Cultural Association which is a group of Odias in Delhi (based in Haryana), the Odia Association Of Delhi (which owns the Jagannath Temple) and Odia Mahasangram.

Geographic distribution  Although the total Odia population is unclear, 2001 Census of India puts the population of Odisha at around 36 million. There are smaller Odia communities in the neighbouring states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Most Odias in West Bengal live in the districts of Midnapore and Bankura. Surat in Gujarat also has a large Odia population, primarily diamond workers in the southern district of Ganjam. Bengaluru and Hyderabad have sizable Odia population due to an IT boom in late 2000s. Some Odias have migrated to Bangladesh where they are known as Bonaz community. While the southern part of the state has inter migration within the country, the northern part of the state has migration towards the middle east and the Western world. Balasore and cuttack are known as immigration centers of Odisha. Most of the Odia population abroad originates predominantly from the northern district of Balasore followed by Cuttack and Bhadrak. The migrants who work within the country predominantly originate from Ganjam and Puri districts. While most American Odias prior to 1980 came from Balasore, Sambalpur and Cuttack, increased demand for software engineers and adoption have brought Odias from other areas. Migration to the United Kingdom has been recorded since 1935, where mostly people from Balasore in undivided Bengal province went to work to United Kingdom and thereafter continuing a chain migration very predominant then, and continues to this day. Most British Odias have obtained British citizenship. In the late 2000s many Odias, predominantly from Balasore and Cuttack, went to the US East coast to study and to work.

In 544, Marcellus was appointed a general, along with Constantinianus, in the ongoing Lazic War (541‚Äì562) against Sassanid Persia, replacing the killed generals Justus (a cousin of Justinian and thus Marcellus's uncle) and Peranius..

It is useful for deciding that strings with a given number of terminals are not accepted by a context-free grammar. It was first proved by Rohit Parikh in 1961 and republished in 1966. Definitions and formal statement Let \\\\Sigma={a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_k} be an alphabet. The Parikh vector of a word is defined as the function p:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to\\\\mathbb{N}^k, given by p(w)=(w_{a_1}, w_{a_2}, \\\\ldots, w_{a_k}) where w_{a_i} denotes the number of occurrences of the letter a_i in the word w. A subset of \\\\mathbb{N}^k is said to be linear if it is of the form u_0 + \\\\mathbb{N}u_1 + \\\\dots + \\\\mathbb{N}u_m = {u_0+t_1u_1+\\\\dots+t_mu_m \\\\mid t_1,\\\\ldots,t_m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}} for some vectors u_0,\\\\ldots,u_m. A subset of \\\\mathbb{N}^k is said to be semi-linear if it is a union of finitely many linear subsets. Statement 1: Let L be a context-free language. Let P(L) be the set of Parikh vectors of words in L, that is, P(L) = {p(w) \\\\mid w \\\\in L}. Then P(L) is a semi-linear set. Two languages are said to be commutatively equivalent if they have the same set of Parikh vectors. Statement 2: If S is any semi-linear set, the language of words whose Parikh vectors are in S is commutatively equivalent to some regular language. Thus, every context-free language is commutatively equivalent to some regular language. These two equivalent statements can be summed up by saying that the image under p of context-free languages and of regular languages is the same, and it is equal to the set of semilinear sets. Strengthening for bounded languages A language L is bounded if L\\\\subset w_1^*\\\\ldots w_k^* for some fixed words w_1,\\\\ldots, w_k. Ginsburg and Spanier gave a necessary and sufficient condition, similar to Parikh's theorem, for bounded languages. Call a linear set stratified, if in its definition for each i\\\\ge 1 the vector u_i has the property that it has at most two non-zero coordinates, and for each i,j\\\\ge 1 if each of the vectors u_i,u_j has two non-zero coordinates, i_1 and j_1, respectively, then their order is not i_1. A semi-linear set is stratified if it is a union of finitely many stratified linear subsets. The Ginsburg-Spanier theorem says that a bounded language L is context-free if and only if {(n_1,\\\\ldots,n_k)\\\\mid w_1^{n_1}\\\\ldots w_k^{n_k}\\\\in L} is a stratified semi-linear set. Significance The theorem has multiple interpretations. It shows that a context-free language over a singleton alphabet must be a regular language and that some context-free languages can only have ambiguous grammars. Such languages are called inherently ambiguous languages. From a formal grammar perspective, this means that some ambiguous context-free grammars cannot be converted to equivalent unambiguous context-free grammars.

It was suggested by the British philosopher of language J. L. Austin in 1955 in the lectures now known as How to Do Things With Words. Austin argued that performative utterances are not meaningfully evaluated as true or false but rather by other measures, which would hold that a statement such as \\"thank you\\" is not meant to describe a fact and to interpret it as such would be to commit the descriptive fallacy. Role of 'descriptive fallacy' in Austin's philosophy Austin's label of 'descriptive fallacy' was aimed primarily at logical positivism, and his speech act theory was largely a response to logical positivism's view that only statements that are logically or empirically verifiable have cognitive meaning. Logical positivism aimed to approach philosophy on the model of empirical science, seeking to express philosophical statements in ways to render them verifiable by empirical means. Statements that cannot be verified as either true or false are seen as meaningless. This would exclude many statements about religion, metaphysics, aesthetics, or ethics as meaningless and philosophically uninteresting, making merely emotive or evocative claims expressing one's feelings rather than making verifiable claims about reality. Austin disagreed with the positivist's contention that the only philosophically significant use of language is to describe reality by stating facts, pointing out that speakers do much more with language than merely describe reality. For example, asking questions, making requests or issuing orders, offering invitations, making promises, and many other common statements are not descriptive. Rather, they are performative: in making such statements, speakers do things rather than describe things. Based on this distinction of what Austin labeled as constative utterances (statements that describe, which were the focus of logical positivism) and performative utterances (statements that perform or do something), Austin developed his speech act theory to investigate how we do things with words.

Located at First Street and Eastern Avenue in the Belvedere Gardens section of East Los Angeles, today the cemetery is now bordered on the south by the Pomona Freeway (60) and on the east by the Long Beach Freeway (710). The cemetery was established by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of Los Angeles (CCBA) in 1922 to provide burial grounds for Chinese residents in Los Angeles,Chinese Cemetery of Los Angeles official web site as at the time, all cemeteries in Los Angeles barred anyone of Chinese descent from purchasing burial plots. CCBA also owns a section of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills that also functions as a Chinese Cemetery. Background Racism against persons of Chinese descent in Los Angeles and the United States during the 19th Century was the primary driving force behind the creation of the Chinese Cemetery as well as the reason Union Station displaced the original Chinatown during the same time period.Bringing up the dead - The Standard An estimated 10,000 Chinese lived in Los Angeles during the late 19th century. Almost all were men who came to work on the railroads. Due to the Chinese Exclusion Act and other laws targeting the Chinese, they could not marry U.S. citizens or own property, and they were limited to only a few occupations such as launderers and house boys or undesirable jobs such as ditch diggers. They were banned from most shops and public institutions and were the target of racist violence that often went unpunished. They were also barred from burial in all locations except a city owned potter's field. History The only place that allowed burial of Chinese persons was an indigent graveyard or \\"Potters Field\\" at Lorena and 1st streets, adjacent to Evergreen Cemetery. At the time, it was owned by the City and then County of Los Angeles. The founders of Evergreen Cemetery gave the city a parcel of the proposed cemetery in 1877 for use as a potter's field in return for a zoning variance to allow the cemetery. The Chinese community was allowed to utilize a corner of the city's potter's field and erected a shrine in September 1888. Unlike white indigents, who were buried at no charge, the Chinese had to pay US$10 to be interred. Ownership of the indigent cemetery passed from the City to the County of Los Angeles in 1917. At the time, it was clear the potter's field would have burial space for only a few more years, so the Chinese community responded by purchasing land and opening the Chinese Cemetery. Meanwhile, the county used the founding of the new cemetery as an opportunity to extend the useful life of the potter's field. Norman Martin, Superintendent for the County Department of Charities, wrote a letter to Chan Kai Sing, Secretary of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. In the letter, dated June 19, 1923, he wrote: \\"Recently your people established a new Chinese cemetery on East 1st Street, and it would be highly desirable if the bodies buried in the county cemetery could be transferred to your new location,\\" Despite acknowledging that each grave cost the Chinese US$10, and that there were 902 people buried there, Martin said he wanted the remains moved to the new cemetery and offered $2 per body as compensation. \\"The idea being that you would move all of the bodies as fast as practicable.\\" Evergreen Cemetery purchased most of the potter's field from the county in 1964, and the area was prepared for new burials by being covered with of compacted soil. The Chinese shrine remained at Evergreen, and was later purchased by the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in 1992, and soon after restored. During the summer of 2005, Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) construction workers widening First Street for the Gold Line light rail extension uncovered the skeletal remains of 174 people buried near the south side of the Los Angeles County Crematorium, adjacent to Evergreen Cemetery. Archaeologists working for the agency determined that the excavation site was likely the Chinese section of the potter's field. The majority of the remains were Asian males found along with rice bowls, jade bracelets, Chinese burial bricks, Asian coins and opium pipes. The remains were reburied inside Evergreen Cemetery, near the Chinese Shrine. A memorial was dedicated on March 7, 2010.  Chinese Cemetery  Due in part to anti-Chinese zealotry in the United States along with the inability to bury their dead outside the soon to be full potter's field, the Chinese community through CCBA purchased land in 1922 for its own cemetery at the corner of First Street and Eastern Avenue. At the time, a plot cost $30. After World War II, additional parcels adjacent to the cemetery were purchased and annexed to the cemetery. Even then, the cemetery is small and neatly arranged with tight lines of mostly 2‚Äì3 foot headstones, etched in Chinese and English. Families regularly come to pay their respects, clean the headstones and leave flowers and other offerings, generally on holidays such as Ching Ming (Chinese Memorial Day) and Ch'ung-Yang Chieh (Hungry Ghosts or All Souls' Day). By 2006, the cemetery was in need of work, so the CCBA refurbished the cemetery and built the \\"Offer of Respect\\" Pavilion. Future The future of the cemetery may be impacted by plans to expand the 710 and 60 freeways that are adjacent to the cemetery. The options chosen have not had serious effect on the Chinese Cemetery but it is possible that future freeway growth will require encroachment into the cemetery site.SR60 Truck Lane Feasibility Study Preliminary Environmental Assessment Report, Prepared by Myra L.

This can be due to glacial erosion and deposition; erosion, sediment transport, and deposition in fluvial systems such as rivers; regolith production; the movement of material on hillslopes; more intermittent events such as rockfalls, debris flows, landslides, and other surface processes. This can also be due to surface uplift and/or subsidence. A typical landscape evolution model takes many of these factors into account. Landscape evolution models are used primarily in the field of geomorphology. As they improve, they are beginning to be consulted by land managers to aid in decision making, most recently in the area of degraded landscapes. The earliest of these models were developed in the 1970s. In these models, water was run across a mesh, and cell elevations were changed in response to calculated erosion. Modern landscape evolution models can leverage GPUs and other acceleration hardware to run quickly.

Sometimes referred to by the acronym BVGAYS, the membership of the Society consists of persons living predominantly in Bay View, who volunteer their time and talents by maintaining public gardens in Bay View. Inherent to the group's philosophy is the principle that by maintaining one's own property, others are inspired to follow by example. Objectives According to the organization's by-laws, the purpose of the Bay View Garden And Yard Society is: > * To have fun while promoting the Bay View community through the > beautification of our gardens and yards. * To share gardening information, > exchange plants, and share information that is of particular interest to > those living in Bay View. * To encourage others in Bay View to maintain > their gardens, yards, and homes. * To volunteer our time and talent in > maintaining public gardens in Bay View. Some of the Society's member events and functions include annual plant exchanges, round robins at member's homes, monthly group dining out, and tours of local greenhouses and botanical gardens. In addition to the development of public gardens throughout Bay View, the group enjoys a high visibility in the community by presenting gardening demonstrations at the South Shore Farmers' Market, hosting gardening seminars, contributing to temporary art installations, and participating in local events such as the Bay View Neighborhood Association's Winter Blast and Chill-on-the-Hill. Beyond the initial social aspects of the Society, the group became more involved in a variety of community projects: participating in neighborhood cleanups, assisting local schools with rain-garden development, and the installation of several landscaping projects to add to the aesthetics of the neighborhood. The group planting at the KK Triangle Garden One of the group's original projects was the Bay View Firehouse garden at Milwaukee Fire Department Engine 11, located at 2526 S. Kinnickinnic Avenue. In 2002, the group planted and maintained gardens at the Beulah Brinton Community Center, and installed a Liberty Garden at the WWII Memorial on Kinnickinnic & Russell Avenues. In 2004, the group added new park benches and assumed the maintenance of the flower planters at the Pryor Avenue Iron Well. In 2008, the group teamed up with the Bay View Neighborhood Association and the City of Milwaukee to tear out a concrete island and develop a garden in the median at the intersection of Kinnickinnic, Howell & Lincoln Avenues. The group continues to maintain and develop most of these sites and has received recognition not only for their efforts in the Bay View community, but also for their contributions to the gay community in Milwaukee. Community gardening Entrance to the Village Roots Garden during the Celebrate Roots event Since 2001, the main centerpiece and major focus of the Society's efforts has been the Village Roots Garden located at 1115 E. Otjen Street. On February 20, 2002, the South Community Organization donated the vacant lot to Milwaukee Urban Gardens (MUG), a nonprofit land trust. The lot became MUG's first owned property, and the Bay View Garden And Yard Society soon began developing the empty lot into Bay View's first community garden. The Society members provided the labor, maintenance, and most of the plants for the site, and the gardens there remain the primary focus of the group. The core of the site consists of eight 8-foot square raised community garden beds that are rented annually for a nominal fee, and four triangular raised trial-garden beds maintained by the group. Outlining the lot are large beds planted with fruit trees and shrubs to provide shelter and food for birds, and perennial flowerbeds to attract bees and butterflies. To add a decorative element to the garden, there is a large crushed-stone compass feature inter-planted with thyme, and a grapevine covered cedar pergola with benches. There are also plantings of asparagus, strawberries, raspberries, spring flowering bulbs, and woodland plants. All pathways between the beds are mulched for weed control, and the lawn areas are planted with no-mow grass for ease of maintenance. Renters of the community garden plots have ready access to all of the tools in the garden shed, and there is also a water source nearby. A formal dedication ceremony attended by local dignitaries was held at the garden site on June 26, 2005 to commemorate the completion of the Village Roots Garden and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Bay View Garden And Yard Society. In an effort to promote community participation and environmental awareness, the Society continues to sponsor occasional meetings, celebrations, and garden tours at the site. The community garden is also one of the stops on the annual MUG Fall Community Garden Tour. Membership, funding, and the Bay View Plant Sale Customers shopping during the annual Bay View Plant Sale Membership dues are collected from members annually and are used to fund the group's many public service projects and the operating costs of the Society. Group meetings are held the 4th Wednesday of each month from January through October at the historic Beulah Brinton House, and an annual appreciation dinner is held in November. Beginning in 2005, the group began hosting the annual Bay View Plant Sale to raise the funds necessary for its many gardening and outreach endeavors. In collaboration with the South Shore Farmers' Market and the Milwaukee County Park System, this annual event is held the first Saturday after Memorial Day, rain or shine, at South Shore Park in Bay View. Local businesses help to sponsor the event, and a number of local, commercial plant vendors are invited to attend. Shoppers are able to make their selections from hundreds of annual and perennial plants, and coffee and bakery are also available for sale.

River Yala runs through Bunyore from Nandi hills and Maragoli into Gem in Siaya. There are numerous hills and valleys in Bunyore characterized by huge granite stones. Some of the stones are as tall as 15 meters high and cover an eighth of a mile. The tallest hills, Ebuhando hills, border Maragoli to the west and are adjacent to Maseno Mission Hospital. From these hills one can well see as far as Lake Victoria and most parts of Kisumu town. Other high hills in the region include Emmutete Khusikulu, Ebusiekwe hills, Ebutongoi Khusikulu and Musikulu Ha-Buchichi.

Religion  The majority of Abanyole are Christians. In the early 1900s the African Compound and Interior Mission (ACIM), having established itself in South Africa, began seeking expansion opportunities into the African Great Lakes region. A missionary by the name Baker, was sent from South Africa to explore mission opportunities in the African Great Lakes. His expedition led to Bunyore in the Nyanza Province‚Äîmodern day Western Province‚Äîof Kenya where he found and annexed a suitable large parcel of land (Kima, Bunyore where the missionaries were to set up church in circa A.D. 1905.), and a welcoming pious native population amenable to Christianity, and hankering for edification opportunities. Baker returned to South Africa and another missionary, Robert Wilson together with his wife, was sent to begin work in the area. Whereas, their work flourished, the parent ministry in South Africa lacked pertinent resources to sustain its African Great Lakes mission. Consequently, the ACIM was compelled to cede its African Great Lakes mission to the auspices of the United States of America-based Church of God, headquartered at Anderson in the State of Indiana. The Church of God established itself as the major denomination amongst the people of Bunyore. However, the dominance of the Church of God in Bunyore came to an end in 1924; when Bunyore became the pillar of strength of the Anglican Church.Hastings, Adrian. The Church in Africa: 1450-1950. Oxford: Clarendon, 1994. The reversal of the Church of God's dominance in Bunyore was in consequence of the wedding of Esau Khamati Oriedo and Evangeline Ohana Olukhanya Analo-Oriedo, which took place on 29 September 1923 in the Church of God Mission church at Kima. The couple's Christian wedding ceremony was proceeded with a traditional African reception; an act that was utterly unacceptable to the Church of God missionary, Rev. H. C. Kramer (the wedding officiant)The original Church of God Mission, Kima Bunyore Mission \\"Certificate of Marriage\\" issued ex post facto to Mr. and Mrs. Esau Khamati Oriedo on 12 November 1954 (signed by Rev. Daudi Otieno); in recognition of Mr. & Mrs. Oriedo‚Äôs previous contribution to the Church of God Mission, Kima Bunyore Mission and their continued proselytizing of Christianity in Bunyore and the rest of Nyanza province. This ex post facto acknowledgement, of Mr. and Mrs. Esau Khamati Oriedo‚Äôs matrimony and stewardship to the church and Christianity, ushered in the beginning of a metamorphosis of the Church of God Mission‚Äô embrace of a more open attitude towards syncretism of the Christian doctrine with customary indigenous African values, which facilitated the effectiveness of the church‚Äôs teachings. who closed the church and demanded an act of contrition.Hastings, Adrian. \\"Page 579.\\" The Church in Africa: 1450-1950. Oxford: Clarendon, 1994. Rather than acquiesce, the newlywed couple persuaded other members to resign from the Church of God; and with blessings of the Anglican Archdeacon Owen went on to become the founder of Ebwali St. John Anglican church (The evolution of the three modern era Maseno Dioceses of the Anglican Church of Kenya). Consequently, the Nyanza province‚Äîonce the stronghold of the Church of God and outside the Anglican influence‚Äîbecame a pillar of Anglican strength.Hastings, Adrian. The Church in Africa: 1450-1950. Oxford: Clarendon, 1994. Print.

It was equipped with T-55s and BMP-1s. It was rendered incapable for combat during the Battle of Nasiriyah in March 2003, during the invasion. It was then dissolved along with the rest of the Iraqi Army by Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2. The reconstruction of the Iraqi Army began in 2003.

This will be created with the units in excess of the 25th Brigade as a base at FOB Kalsu in Iskandariyah. The former Baghdad Brigade was previously reported as having been re- designated as the 56th Brigade. Now, it has been re-subordinated to the 6th Motorized Division.DJ Elliott, Montrose Toast On 22 December 2009, 135 members of the 56/6 Brigade completed mechanized infantry courses and qualified on the M113A2 Armored Personnel Carrier at the Camp Taji Armor School. M113A2s usually have a crew of 2 each and carry 11 infantry. This many crew graduating indicates that the 56/6 Brigade is converting to a Combined Arms or Armored Brigade since that is crew for 6 companies of mechanized infantry. The 56/6 Brigade has a brigade number belonging to the unformed 15th Division and could be a temporary assignment pending the formation of a new division.

Plot  Tragic happenings result from conflict arising from the active feminism of Asta Cadell, a robust professional woman, after her motorbike breaks down in the fictitious township of Ginborak during a lone tour of outback Western Australia. She gives support to a young girl, Lizzie, who has been gang raped by local youths; a crime compounded by the neurotically tolerant attitude adopted by the town's citizens, including the police sergeant and even her father, who blame the girl for the boys' behaviour. Asta is treated disrespectfully by men in the local pub. Directed to the town's mechanic, Tim Curtis, Asta stays with his family as a guest. Members of the family are visibly troubled and suffering from some sort of depressive condition. One night when Lizzie cannot bear her parents' fighting anymore, she runs outside crying, where Asta reaches out to her, forming a protective relationship. Asta's assertive personality brings her into conflict with the bullying female owner of a meat-processing factory and with the ruthless group of young men who have pack-raped several girls in the town. The youths turn their unpleasant attentions to her, at which she vigorously defends herself, inflicting injuries on some of the boys. She complains to the police sergeant, who explains that the boys are simply having fun, and threatens Asta with an assault charge, at which she reveals she is a barrister and not an easy target for his corrupt behaviour. She begins to speak more openly and energetically, in public and private, about the scandalous affairs which she has learned are occurring in this isolated town. She becomes a role-model and source of strength to the violated and injusticed Lizzie, whose own father even struggles to deny the truth of what has happened under his very nose. Championed on by Asta, little by little, Lizzie draws upon enough courage to begin both straying further from the safety of her own house, and confronting her own father about his denial. But even her own house and family become targets for the blind rage which erupts when the young violators and their complacent parents learn that Asta and Lizzie mean business‚Äîthey are intent on pressing charges to get the boys imprisoned.

They offered the script to Joan Long who was busy on other projects but then Paul Barron read a draft and became enthusiastic. Steve Jodrell became attached as director.

Gonzalez, 413 F.Supp.2d 262 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) was a United States District Court for the Southern District of New York case regarding obscene materials published online. The plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the obscenity provision of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). She claimed that it was overbroad when applied in the context of the Internet because certain contents deemed lawful in some communities and unlawful in others will be restricted due to the open access of the Internet. The plaintiff also sought a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the obscenity provision of the CDA. The court concluded that insufficient evidence was presented to show there was substantial variation in community standards, as applied in the \\"Miller test\\", and to show how much protected speech would actually be impaired because of these differences. The relief sought was denied, and the court ruled for the defendant. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this ruling without comment. Background Nitke had published images on her website that were a means of alternative sexual expression: adults performing various sexual activities. Previously, in Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court had ruled that the indecent speech provision in the CDA was overbroad and that it unnecessarily impaired protected speech.Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997) Barbara Nitke and the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which advocates for people who practice non-traditional sexual practices, sought a similar ruling against the \\"obscene speech\\" provisions of the CDA and injunctive relief against future application of those sections of the CDA, arguing that the differences in community standards of what is considered \\"obscene speech\\" would have a \\"chilling effect\\" on any content on the Internet. Alberto Gonzales was the Attorney General of the United States at the time, making him the named defendant in this case.United States Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General (2009).  The Communications Decency Act of 1996  47 U.S.C. ¬ß 223(a)(1)(B) criminalizes conduct which \\"knowingly ...makes, creates or solicits, and ... initiates the transmission of ...\\" an obscene or indecent communication to a juvenile.\\"Brief Legal Perspective\\", The Internet, Libraries & Matter Harmful to Juveniles Subject to certain defenses, this is regardless of whether or not the minor accessed the content or not. \\"Given the size of the potential audience for most messages, in the absence of a viable age verification process, the sender [of any given communication] must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it.\\"  Vagueness  The court granted the government's motion to dismiss the vagueness argument, citing the Supreme Court's decision that the Miller test was not unconstitutionally vague.Nitke v. Gonzalez, 47 U.S. 223 (2005).  Overbreadth  The plaintiffs in this case had the burden of proving that the CDA was substantially overbroad. Specifically, the court indicated that the plaintiffs needed to establish: #that a substantive amount of speech was not covered by the societal value prong of the Miller test and that these contents would lead to different conclusions when subjected to different community standards in the country. #that the variation in community standards were causing suppression of speech and that there was no viable measure to limit the exposure of the contents to those communities with more accepting standards. #that the affirmative defenses of the CDA were not sufficient in limiting the coverage of protected speech by the CDA. The court concluded that insufficient evidence was provided by the plaintiffs to support these points, and the United States Supreme Court denied their appeal in 2006. \\"The judgment is affirmed.\\"Alan, Esq, The Judgment is Affirmed (2006). Responses The case established community content guidelines for obscene content. If the case had not been brought, according to attorney John Wirenius, \\"many more Internet users [would] likely face the constitutionally unsupportable choice faced by Ms. Nitke: either to censor her published images or face prosecution.\\" Net Obscenity Case Decision, High court affirms decision in Net obscenity case (2006). This would, in turn, cause users and publishers to use more discretion when publishing potentially obscene content online.

Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 19. Introduction  In Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from God, and should therefore be both respected and protected.Shomali, Mohammad Ali. \\"Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme.\\" Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-2.Younis, Huda. \\"Islamic Bioethics.\\" O&G; Winter 2008: 24. This is evident in many Qur‚Äôanic verses or ayat, one of the most important being: > \\"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or > spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all > mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved > the lives of all mankind.\\"(Qur‚Äôan 5:32) It is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved: # Saving a life is obligatory. # Unjustified taking of a life is classified as murder and, thus, forbidden. Though Muslims recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur‚Äôan 2:258), the Qur‚Äôan illustrates that God has instilled in them reason, free will, the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur‚Äôan 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur‚Äôan 45:13). With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible. Sources The fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law (shari‚Äôa) and Islamic ethics. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or fatwas regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as bid‚Äòah (innovation) and, therefore, is haram (impermissible).Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 14. For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, * Qur‚Äôan, * Hadith or Sunnah * Ijtihad ** In Sunni Islam, ijtihad includes qiyas (analogy), ijma (consensus), maslaha (public welfare) and ‚Äòurf (customary practice) ** In Shi‚Äôa Islam it is composed solely of al-'aql (reason) Principles Principles of bioethics in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, Tom Beauchamp and James F. Childress, in their book, Principles of Biomedical Ethics. The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system.Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 21. These bioethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur‚Äôanic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the Oath of the Muslim Doctor and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.Al-Hathery, Shabib. \\"The Muslim Doctor: Duties and Responsibilities.\\" Islamic Medical Association Conference, Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Ed. Khan, Y. and H. Bouagada. 8. Authority  Formulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period.Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-14. After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority (mufti) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory (wajib/fard), recommended (mustahabb), neutral (mubah), discouraged (makruh) or forbidden (haram).Shomali, Mohammad Ali. \\"Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme.\\" Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 4. Modernity As health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many Islamic countries which work together with ulema to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of bioethics is jeopardized.Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 15-16. The importance of Islamic law (sharia‚Äô) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include abortion, fertility treatments, family planning, euthanasia, genetic research, cloning, stem cell research among many other issues.Shomali, Mohammad Ali. \\"Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme.\\" Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-8.Younis, Huda. \\"Islamic Bioethics.\\" O&G; Winter 2008: 24-26.Atighetchi, Darius.

Mendelssohn's biographer Eric Werner has written of them: \\"Next to Bach's works, Mendelssohn's Organ Sonatas belong to the required repertory of all organists.\\"Werner (1963), 424 Background Mendelssohn was a skilled organist, and during his visits to Britain gave a number of well-received organ recitals. These often included the improvisations for which he was famous (e.g., at his recitals during his 1842 tour in London and Oxford).Todd (2003), 437‚Äì438. In an article in the magazine Musical World of 1838, the English organist Henry John Gauntlett noted: > His execution of Bach's music is transcendently great [...] His extempore > playing is very diversified ‚Äì the soft movements full of tenderness and > expression, exquisitely beautiful and impassioned [...] In his loud preludes > there are an endless variety of new ideas [....] and the pedal passages so > novel and independent [...] as to take his auditor quite by surprise.Cited > in Brown (2003), 214‚Äì215 These qualities are evident in the organ sonatas, which were commissioned as a \\"set of voluntaries\\" by the English publishers Coventry and Hollier in 1844 (who also commissioned at the same time an edition by him of the organ chorales of J. S. Bach),Todd (2003), 478 and were published in 1845. Correspondence between Mendelssohn and Coventry relating to the Sonatas took place between August 1844 and May 1845. Mendelssohn suggested that Gauntlett undertake the proof reading, but this was in fact probably carried out by Vincent Novello.Edwards (1895), 3 The publisher's original announcement referred to the work as \\"Mendelssohn's School of Organ-Playing\\" (see illustration), but this title was rescinded at the composer's request.Werner (1963), 425 One-hundred ninety subscribers to the publication produced a sales income of ¬£199/10/-. Mendelssohn himself received ¬£60 from the publisher,Edwards (1895), 4 . The music In response to the commission, Mendelssohn at first drafted seven individual voluntaries, but then determined to extend and regroup them into a set of six sonatas, meaning by this not pieces in classical sonata form, but using the word as it had been used by Bach, for a collection or suite of varying pieces.Todd (2003), 486‚Äì487 The sonatas include references to a number of Lutheran chorales, and No. 3 incorporates a processional piece which Mendelssohn had begun writing for the wedding of his sister Fanny in 1829. No 4 was the last to be written.Todd (2003), 479, 487 The six sonatas are: * No. 1 in F minor (Allegro ‚Äì Adagio ‚Äì Andante recitativo ‚Äì Allegro assai vivace) * No. 2 in C minor (Grave ‚Äì Adagio ‚Äì Allegro maestoso e vivace ‚Äì Fugue: Allegro moderato) * No. 3 in A major (based on Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir) (Con moto maestoso ‚Äì Andante tranquillo) * No. 4 in B major (Allegro con brio ‚Äì Andante religioso ‚Äì Allegretto ‚Äì Allegro maestoso) * No. 5 in D major (Andante ‚Äì Andante con moto ‚Äì Allegro) * No. 6 in D minor (based on Luther's chorale Vater unser im Himmelreich) (Chorale and variations: Andante sostenuto ‚Äì Allegro molto ‚Äì Fuga ‚Äì Finale: Andante) Reception Edmund Chipp, who probably gave the first public performance of Mendelssohn's Organ Sonatas The sonatas demand good standards of pitch and touch from the organ and also a satisfactory pedalboard. Few English instruments were adequately equipped in these respects at the time, which probably explains the slow growth in interest in the pieces in Britain. Mendelssohn himself refused to play them when invited to do so at the Birmingham Festival of 1846, writing from Leipzig to his friend Ignaz Moscheles: > [T]he last time I passed through Birmingham the touch of the organ appeared > to me so heavy that I could not venture to perform upon it in public. If > however it is materially improved I shall be happy to play one of my > sonatas; but I should not wish this to be announced before I had tried the > organ myself.Moscheles (1878) 275‚Äì276, letter of 12 July 1846. Mendelssohn's > previous visit to Birmingham had been in 1837 to conduct his oratorio St. > Paul. The first public performance in Britain of any of the sonatas was probably given by Edmund Chipp in 1846;Edwards (1895), 5 he also performed all six from memory in 1848.Scholes (1947), II, 596 Although British critics rated the music highly, often drawing attention to its echoes of the composer's improvisatory style, Mendelssohn himself never performed any of the sonatas in public, either in England or elsewhere.Stanley (2004), 159 He did however play them privately to the English music critic William Rockstro during the latter's visit to Frankfurt am Main in 1845, and wrote to his sister Fanny Mendelssohn in 1845 offering to play them to her.Edwards (1895), 5 The sonatas were well received in other European countries, as they had been simultaneously published by Maurice Schlesinger in Paris, Ricordi in Milan, and Breitkopf & H√§rtel in Leipzig. Robert Schumann wrote to Mendelssohn in 1845 that he and his wife had played them over on the piano, and described them as \\"intensely poetical [...] what a perfect picture they form!\\"Scholes (1947), II, 596, Edwards (1895), 4 They are likely to have prompted Schumann's Six Fugues on B-A-C-H, and, later in the century, the organ sonatas of Josef Rheinberger.Todd (2003), 487 References ;Notes ;Sources *Brown, Clive, A Portrait of Mendelssohn, New Haven and London (2003). *Edwards, F.

They were connected to Post-Impressionism and radical movements in literature and music as well, and led to the rise of modernism in art culture. The members of The Eight, R√≥bert Ber√©ny, Dezs≈ë Czig√°ny, B√©la Cz√≥bel, K√°roly Kernstok, √ñd√∂n M√°rffy, Dezs≈ë Orb√°n, Bertalan P√≥r and Lajos Tihanyi, were primarily inspired by French painters and art movements including Paul C√©zanne, Henri Matisse, and Fauvism. Exhibits were held in 2011 and 2012 in Hungary and Austria, respectively, to mark the centenary of the group's first exhibit as The Eight in Budapest in 1911. Background The Eight opened their first exhibition on 30 December 1909 at the K√∂nyves K√°lm√°n Salon (Budapest) under the title New Pictures. Their second exhibition, entitled The Eight, opened in April 1911 in the National Salon. While The Eight as a group had only three exhibitions, their activity was of immense significance, as their influence went far beyond the visual arts. The exhibitions were accompanied by series of symposia, and by events featuring new Hungarian literature and contemporary music. M√°rffy was proud of this intellectual kinship throughout his life. A year before his death, he said: > \\"It fills me with happiness to know that my youth coincided with that > memorable period in intellectual development, when not only in Europe but > also in Hungary, those seeking new, better things in literature, music, > painting, science, politics and social life were carried by vibrant, > seething currents.

It is suggested that in this mode, you place a real golf ball on the ground so you may see a point of reference while playing. The version also adds 36 miniature golf holes and an online disc golf mode.

The colour of Azure Lakelet (635 m; also called: Blue or Emerald) water is connected with the presence of copper ions. Its water, besides its colour, is clean, thus during hot summer days there can be seen people bathing in it; water is usually quite cold here, though. Green Lakelet (730 m; also called Black Pond), same as Azure Lakelet owes its colour to copper compounds. Depending on rainfall, it temporarily disappears.

It is the first part of a double album about the critique of Christianity from different philosophical and personal angles, with its companion album, \\"Anthropocentric\\" which was released on November 9, 2010 in North America. Theme The songs, art and lyrics of this album tell the story of the rise of the heliocentric world view - the idea that the earth revolves around the sun, and that the sun is stationary and at the center of the solar system. Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei were the first popular ambassadors of this idea, although ancient Greek astronomers like Aristarchus had already posited this theory centuries before. The journey starts with the creation of the firmament in Genesis 1:6-20 (Firmament) and ancient explanations of the movement of celestial bodies in 1 Enoch 72:2-5 (The 1st Commandment of the Luminaries). It continues with Copernicus and Galileo, the first propagators of heliocentrism who were not yet in conflict with the Church (Ptolemy Was Wrong) and Giordano Bruno, who was burnt at the stake of the Roman Inquisition for being a heretic (Catharsis of a Heretic). Arthur Rimbaud's's criticism of moral law in his essay Reasons Not to Believe in God and Nietzsche's rejection of fundamental Christian values has inspired the lyrics to Metaphysics of the Hangman. The album concludes with the greatest achievement in the history of modern science, Darwin's theory of evolution (The Origin of Species) and ideas inspired by evolution biologist and passionate atheist Richard Dawkins (The Origin of God, Epiphany). Its companion album, Anthropocentric, challenges the views of creationists and other modern fundamentalists who believe that the earth is at the center of the universe. Music Musically, 'Heliocentric' covers the largest range of dynamics and styles to date: \\"There are a few really calm songs with mainly piano and vocals, as well as some crushing heavy tunes. There is a very special atmosphere to it that pervades the album\\", comments guitarist Jonathan Nido. \\"Heliocentric\\" continues where the \\"Proterozoic\\" half of Precambrian left off, with dense, epic songs and big orchestrations. The vocals are the biggest departure from previous albums; they are mostly \\"clean,\\" and more soulful. Recording The albums were mainly recorded in the mountainous isolation of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. The band decided to record and mix the album with the band's house sound engineer Julien Fehlmann: \\"We wanted to be in control of every single detail, and we have an amazing studio at hand here. Soundwise this is by far the best-sounding album we have done to date\\". Samples of the tracks were released on the band's website in February 2010.

As the inaugural First Lady of Indonesia, she was the third wife of the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, and the mother of Indonesia's first female president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. She constructed the first flag flown by Indonesia. Life Fatmawati constructed the first flag of Indonesia. The picture shows the first time the Indonesian flag was raised Fatmawati was born on 5 February 1923 in Bengkulu to Hasan Din and Chadijah. One of her ancestors was a princess of a Minangkabau kingdom, Sultanate of Inderapura.Agus, Yusuf, Sejarah Pesisir Selatan, Jakarta : PT. Arina Yudi, 2001 When she met Sukarno she was a teenager and he was married to a 53-year-old woman named Inggit. Unsurprisingly, Sukarno's wife was unwilling to release her husband but, after two years, Inggit agreed to a divorce. Sukarno rationalised the need for his new wife by stating his desire to have a child to carry on his name. Fatmawati with her five children with Sukarno In 1943 Fatmawati became the third wife of Sukarno and the following year gave birth to his first child, a son. Sukarno named his child Guntur meaning thunder. In 1945 she was his wife when Indonesia declared independence. The flag of the new country was sewn by Fatmawati, and the same flag was flown again every year until 1967. She was not his first wife, as he had married twice before. However, all his previous wives had been divorced in accordance with state law. Fatmawati was therefore his only wife at that time. Polygamy thumb There was a growing movement to reform women's rights in Indonesia and part of this was to reform the marriage laws. Fatmawati was not initially in favour of reforming these laws until she found out about her husband's intentions to marry again. Moreover, this time Sukarno had decided that he did not want to divorce Fatmawati but intended to have two wives. Fatmawati objected when her husband took Hartini, his new wife, according to Muslim law. Sukarno married another woman from Java in 1953 and Fatmawati moved out of the presidential palace and lived separately in Jakarta. As part of the settlement Fatmawati was allowed to keep the title of First Lady. This development was a major blow to the growing women's movement. Fatmawati decided that she was going to divorce the President, but she could not find a religious leader who was willing to oppose the will of Sukarno. The women's organisation consoled and advised Fatmawati and they tried to encourage her to return to the palace and reestablish her rights. Sukarno himself was annoyed by this development although his new wife understood Fatmawati's anger.The women's movement in post-colonial Indonesia, Elizabeth Martyn, p137, 2005. Retrieved March 2010 Sukarno's new wife bore him two additional children; however, Sukarno reacted badly when he heard that his latest wife had allowed a women's group to consider transferring the title of First Lady to her. Sukarno returned and had her thrown out of the meeting and exiled to Bogor. In 1953 Fatmawati became concerned about the plight of children with tuberculosis. She founded the Ibu Soekarno Foundation to fund a hospital. The following year a hospital was opened with the assistance of government funding. This was called the Madam Soekarno Hospital and Fatmawati laid the foundation stone in 1954. The birth of the hospital was a long one. The construction of the new building was halted by financial problems and it was not until 1961 that the hospital opened. By that time the hospital was run by the Ministry of Health and it did not specialise in tuberculosis or children but was a general hospital. In 1967 the name was changed to the Fatmawati Central General Hospital.History of Hospital. Retrieved March 2010 Fatmawati's second child, Megawati Soekarnoputri, became president in 2001. Death Fatmawati's grave in Karet Bivak Cemetery, Jakarta Fatmawati died of a heart attack on 14 May 1980 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on her way back to Jakarta from an umra in Mecca.

They are free-living worms, found in both freshwater and marine environments. Description Members of the order Lecithoepitheliata are distinguished from other flatworms by the presence of four nerve cords and the fact that the ovary forms a single structure that produces both the eggs (ovocytes) and nourishing yolk cells (vitellocytes). The vitellocytes form a follicle around the ovocyte, hence the name of the group, which means \\"with a yolk epithelium\\". In most other rhabditophorans, yolk cells, where present at all, are typically formed in glands derived from the ovaries, but separate from them, called vitellaria. Other diagnostic features of this order include the presence of a sharp stylet on the end of the penis, and a simple, unbranched, intestine. The penis lacks a proper pore and is protruded through the mouth. Phylogeny The order Lecithoepitheliata is usually classified as belonging to the clade Neoophora, a subgroup of rhabditophoran flatworms distinguished by the presence of ectolecithal eggs, i.e., yolk is stored outside the ovocytes. However, recently molecular studies have grouped Lecithoepitheliata (at least the family Prorrhynchidae) with the order Polycladida, which has endolecithal eggs, i.e., yolk is stored inside the ovocytes as in most animals. Another previous study, which included representatives of both families of Lecithoepitheliata, concluded that Prorhynchidae is the basalmost clade of Neoophora, followed by Gnosonesimidae. In the former scenario, the ectolecithal condition would have evolved independently twice, and in the latter it would have arisen only once, but Lecithoepitheliata would be paraphyletic. Phylogeny of Lecithoepitheliata in relation to other rhabditophorans according to Laumer & Giribet (2011): Phylogeny according to Egger et al.

The winner of the Espace Paul Ricard Prize in 2001, occasionally working with Olivier MossetL'Officiel Hommes, n¬∞ 64, June-july 2019, p. 65, Morgane Tschiember has participated in over 60 solo and group shows throughout the world (France, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia, Japan, Switzerland and the United States).  Work  Morgane Tschiember has directed her work from two- to three-dimensional pieces, in order to explore the transitions between dimensions, and how they relate to each other. Thus her sculptures are sometimes colorful, in order to make color a pure original material to be shaped, and therefore open a connection between painting and sculpture. Sculpting can also be a way to investigate the relationship between the objects and the places, always trying to have as a result that both are revealed and emphasized so the spectator gets a more complete esthetic experience. She considers herself as \\"classic\\" in the sense that she works on fundamental elements such as form, color, material... that are universals and run through all of art history. But she also explores, in a very personal and innovative way the new possibilities of painting and making sculptures, revealing her interest in how the meaning \\"shifts\\" (not only in how one considers what one is looking at, but because reality can not reside in one single interpretation). As a result, her sculptures try to not only stand in three dimensions, but include others such as time, action, movement, flux or fluids, opening up the place a piece takes and how it relates to where it stands.

It is also known as the Indian Regional Jet (IRJ). This aircraft is claimed to be a turboprop or a jet with a capacity of 80-100 passengers. The basic version will have 80-90 seats (RTA-70). The cost of airliner will be 20 percent lower compared to its global competitors. Development In 2007 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) jointly designed and developed a 70-seater civil regional aircraft. NAL had held discussions with Pratt and Whitney (Canada) and General Electric (U.S.) for an engine. The NAL-designed RTA-70 is meant to ply short-haul routes and compete with planes of French-Italian aircraft maker Avions de Transport R√©gional (ATR), a leading exporter of turbo-prop aircraft to the Indian sub- continent. In 2008, the Indian government through the Ministries of Defence and Civil Aviation have approved the plan and have asked HAL to prepare a roadmap for the project. It will not be an indigenous venture as the government is planning to enter into a memorandum of understanding with major names in the industry like Embraer, Bombardier Aerospace or United Aircraft Corporation. The aircraft was expected to fly in six to seven years. In 2010 at the Indian Aviation exhibition held in Hyderabad, a proposed cabin was on display and more details on the specifications of the aircraft had been revealed. On 23 December 2010, it was announced that the Indian government had asked NAL to consider the use of turbofan engines on the RTA-70. According to an NAL official, the use of a jet engine was seen as \\"a stepping stone to the high end\\" by the government. In September 2019, it was reported that NAL was holding meetings with Minister of Science and Technology for the plan of 70-seater civil aircraft. Regional transport aircraft has always been in the long-term vision. After getting in-principle approval from Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister's Office, preliminary design phase will be completed in one-and-a- half year and will be submitted to government for approval. Further development will start after government sanctions the project. Design The aircraft is claimed to offer 25% lower acquisition costs, 25% lower operating costs and 50% lower maintenance costs than existing turboprop regional aircraft. The 70-seat aircraft will have a range of 1,350 nm (2,500 km), and require a take-off field length and landing field length of 900m (2,950 ft). The aircraft would have a length of 28.6m and a wing-span of 29.4m. The aircraft would have a service ceiling of 30,000 ft, a cruising speed of 300kt, and the noise level would meet Stage 4 criteria. The cabin, which would be able to seat four abreast, would have a width of 3.01m and height of 3.35m. The cargo hold would have a volume of 25m¬≥ (880 ft¬≥). NAL is considering a composite airframe. The aircraft will be powered by two \\"next-generation turboprop engine\\". It would have an indigenous fly-by-wire control system, open distributed modular avionics, automatic dependence surveillance - broadcast navigation capabilities, and advanced displays.

Goggins (May 11, 1934 ‚Äì c. February 20, 2010) was the first African-American woman elected to the South Carolina legislature; in 1974 she gained a seat in the state House of Representatives. She was re-elected and served a total of three terms before resigning for unspecified health reasons in 1980. Early life and education Born in rural Anderson County, South Carolina in 1934, Juanita was one of ten children of sharecroppers. She was the only one to earn a four-year college degree. She graduated from South Carolina State College, a historically black college, where she also earned a master's degree. She became a teacher in the segregated public schools of Rock Hill. Marriage and family Juanita married Horace W. Goggins, a dentist. They had a son whom they named Horace W., II. Activism Motivated by her interest in education, Goggins became active in the civil rights movement and politics. Rock Hill was the site of civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s to end segregation in public facilities. In 1972 she was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, where she was the first black woman to represent the state of South Carolina. That year she was appointed as a member of the South Carolina State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. (She has erroneously been reported as the first black woman appointed to the Civil Rights Commission, but that honor was held by Frankie Muse Freeman, appointed in 1964.) As a nationally known, groundbreaking figure, Goggins was invited to the White House during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. Political career Defeating a white man, Goggins was elected in 1974 to represent Rock Hill in the state House of Representatives, and re- elected to serve a total of three terms. Among her accomplishments as legislator were securing funding for sickle-cell anemia testing in county health departments; the disease affects primarily African Americans, whose health programs had been underfunded during the decades of segregation and disfranchisement. She also helped pass a 1977 law that provided for education funding in South Carolina; it was still in use at the time of her death. The Associated Press wrote: \\"Her proposals to expand kindergarten and to reduce student-teacher ratios in the primary grades were adopted after she left politics in 1980, citing health issues.\\" Her last surviving sibling, Ilese Dixon, later said of her: \\"She was not bashful or anything. She liked to talk. I used to say she could sell an Eskimo ice. She was just lively and smart. She thought she could fix the world.\\" Later years Several years after Goggins left the state legislature, she and her husband divorced. She moved to Columbia, where she worked for a time as a state social worker. She also established a nonprofit tutoring service. She became increasingly reclusive within her neighborhood of mostly elderly black people. She had let one neighbor in only once in 16 years. After being mugged in the neighborhood, she did not go out as much and he used to get groceries for her, leaving them at her door. Her son Horace W. Goggins, Jr. and the property manager, Linda Martin, had tried to arrange help, including monitoring from social services, but Juanita Goggins refused the assistance. She died in February 2010 of hypothermia, freezing to death in her home, although the heat was working. The electricity had been turned off for non-payment but after her death, officials found that Goggins had $2500 in cash in the house. Neighbors contacted Goggins' landlord after they had noticed that her lights had not been turned on for some time. The coroner stated that he found indications that she had suffered from dementia. She is believed to have died on February 20, 2010, however, her body was not discovered for 11 days. Legacy and honors *In 2009, part of Highway 5 in Rock Hill, South Carolina was named in her honor.

Strickland, 560 F.3d 443 (6th Cir. 2009), is a decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals involving a constitutional challenge‚Äîboth facially and as-applied to internet communications‚Äîto an Ohio statute prohibiting the dissemination or display to juveniles of certain sexually-explicit materials or performances. The Sixth Circuit panel declined to resolve the constitutional issue but, instead, certified two questions to the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the interpretation of the statute.Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression v. Strickland, The Ohio Supreme Court answered both questions affirmatively and placed a narrowing construction on the statute.Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression v. Cordray, Slip Opinion No. 2010-Ohio-149(Oh. Jan. 27, 2010). Since the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, the Sixth Circuit has not reheard the case. Facts and procedural background In 2002, plaintiffs American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, joined by various publishers, retailers, and web site operators, sued Ohio's Attorney General and Ohio county prosecutors in United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged that Ohio Revised Code ¬ß2907.01(E) and (J), which prohibited the dissemination or display of \\"materials harmful to juveniles\\", unconstitutionally violated both the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Plaintiffs specifically challenged the statute's definition of \\"harmful to juveniles\\", as well as the provisions governing internet dissemination of those materials.Bookfriends, Inc. v. Taft, 223 F. Supp. 2d 932 (S.D. Ohio 2002). The district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the statute as applied to internet communications because it was unconstitutionally overbroad and failed strict scrutiny, but rejected a challenge under the Commerce Clause. The court held the statute unconstitutional because the statute's definition of \\"material harmful to minors\\" did not comply with two United States Supreme Court decisions ‚Äì Miller v. California and Ginsberg v. New York ‚Äì which defined the constitutional standards for the regulation of obscenity and the regulation of material deemed \\"harmful to minors.\\"Bookfriends, Inc. v. Taft, 223 F. Supp. 2d at 945 . Defendants appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit. Before the Sixth Circuit could hear the appeal, however, the Ohio General Assembly amended the challenged statute. The Sixth Circuit remanded the case to the district court to consider the constitutionality of the newly amended statute.Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression v. Strickland, 560 F.3d at 445. At the district court, plaintiffs challenged the provisions of ¬ß2907.31(E), which prohibited the distribution of certain sexually explicit materials that were \\"harmful to juveniles\\", and ¬ß2907.31(D), \\"internet provision\\" of the statute.O.R.C. ¬ß 2907.31(D),(E). Like their earlier challenge, plaintiffs alleged that the amended statutes violated both the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause, specifically with regard to the statute's definition of \\"material harmful to juveniles\\" and the breadth of the provisions related to internet dissemination. Both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression v. Strickland, The district court concluded that the amended statute's definition of material \\"harmful to juveniles\\" was not unconstitutionally vague, and thus satisfied the Supreme Court's tests under Miller and Ginsberg. However, the district court concluded that the statute's treatment of \\"internet communications\\" was unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. The court then partially granted and denied summary judgment to both parties.Id. at 1093-94, 1099, 1106. Both parties appealed the decision. Sixth Circuit decision=Issues presented Defendants appealed the district court's determination that the section of the statute governing internet dissemination, ¬ß 2907.31(D), was unconstitutionally overbroad and violative of the First Amendment. Plaintiffs appealed the district court's determination that the section of the statute defining material \\"harmful to juveniles\\", ¬ß2907.01(E), was not void for vagueness, and the court's determination that ¬ß 2907.31(D) was not violative of the Commerce Clause.Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression v. Strickland, 560 F.3d 443, 444(6th Cir. 2009). The Sixth Circuit, however, declined to address either party's challenge. Instead, the court focused on the appropriate interpretation of ¬ß 2907.31(D).Id. at 446-47.O.R.C. ¬ß 2907.31(D). Section 2907.31(D) has two sections, both of which relate to the electronic dissemination of material harmful to juveniles. Section 2907.31(D)(1) provides that a person disseminates material harmful to juveniles through electronic communication when that person \\"knows or has reason to believe that the person receiving the information is a juvenile\\". Section 2907.31(D)(2) precludes from criminal liability those persons disseminating material harmful to juveniles if \\"[t]he person has inadequate information to know or have reason to believe that a particular recipient of the information or offer is a juvenile\\", or \\"[t]he method of mass distribution does not provide the person the ability to prevent a particular recipient from receiving the information\\". Plaintiffs argued that Section 2907.31(D) was unconstitutionally overbroad and would significantly chill constitutionally protected, adult-to-adult speech. Despite the statute's requirement that the person \\"know[s] or has reason to believe\\" the person was disseminating material to a juvenile, due to the inherent difficulties in age verification on the internet, \\"any internet user is put on notice that the recipient may be a juvenile\\". Adults engaged in otherwise constitutionally protected speech could therefore become criminally liable under the statute, simply because the material posted was viewed by a minor. Plaintiffs argued that criminal liability could extend to websites in certain circumstances, and that the statute provided no guidance as to the circumstances when an individual would have \\"inadequate information\\" to suspect a juvenile was accessing prohibited material or when a person had \\"the ability to prevent\\" juveniles from accessing such information.Am. Booksellers Found., 560 F.3d at 447. Defendants argued that ¬ß 2907.31(D) did not apply to \\"[w]eb communications, other than such personally directed devices as instant messaging or person-to-person email\\". Plaintiffs contended that ¬ß2907.31(D) exempts a narrower range of internet communication than Defendants admitted and therefore regulates webpage communication in certain circumstances. The Attorney General's construction of the statute to apply only to \\"instant messaging or person-to- person email\\" was a departure from the defendant's construction of the statute in the district court,Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression, 512 F. Supp. at 1093-95 . and not obvious interpretation in light of the text of the statute. However, because \\"the Attorney General does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement authorities\\", the Sixth Circuit was unable to \\"accept [his] interpretation of the law as authoritative\\".Am. Booksellers Found., 560 F.3d at 446-47. Furthermore, Plaintiffs also raised a dormant commerce clause challenge to the statute. The court looked to American Library Association v. Pataki (S.D. N.Y. 1997), which struck down a similar statute on dormant commerce clause grounds in order to conclude that there was no violation, as follows: > In light of recent decisions, upholding state statutes prohibiting spam and > other fraud perpetrated via electronic mail, and the absence of authority to > demonstrate preemption of internet regulation by the Federal government, > this Court cannot adopt Pataki's reasoning that the transient nature of the > internet renders all state regulation of the internet a violation of the > commerce clause. Certification of state law questions \\"Rather than speculate\\" on the proper scope and interpretation of ¬ß 2907.31(D), the Sixth Circuit determined, sua sponte, that \\"the better course ... [was] to provide the Supreme Court of Ohio with the opportunity to interpret the scope of ¬ß 2907.31(D)(2)'s exemptions and the statute's coverage\\". Because the statute had not been authoritatively interpreted by Ohio's highest court and because the narrowing construction of the statute proposed on appeal by the Attorney General was not binding on state officials, the Sixth Circuit certified two questions to the Ohio Supreme Court in order to assist the court's later resolution of the constitutional issues.Id. at 447. Those questions were: > (1) Is the Attorney General correct in construing O.R.C. ¬ß 2907.31(D) to > limit the scope of ¬ß 2907.31(A), as applied to electronic communications, to > personally directed devices such as instant messaging, person-to-person > e-mails, and private chat rooms? > (2) Is the Attorney General correct in construing O.R.C. ¬ß 2907.31(D) to > exempt from liability material posted on generally accessible websites and > in public chat rooms?Id. The court upheld the district court's injunction on enforcement of ¬ß 2907.31 pending further resolution by the court. Subsequent history The Ohio Supreme Court accepted the Sixth Circuit's questions for certification on June 3, 2009.Cordray v. Am. Booksellers Found. for Free Expression, 907 N.E.2d 321(Ohio 2009). The Court heard oral arguments on October 20, 2009. On January 27, 2010, the Court issued its decision, answering both the Sixth Circuit's questions affirmatively, and adopting the statutory construction advocated by the Attorney General. Answering the Sixth Circuit's first question, the Court held that \\"the scope of R.C. 2907.31(D) is limited to electronic communications that can be personally directed, because otherwise the sender of matter harmful to juveniles cannot know or have reason to believe that a particular recipient is a juvenile.\\" With regard to the second question, the Court concluded that \\"a person who posts matter harmful to juveniles on generally accessible websites and in public chat rooms does not violate R.C. 2907.31(D), because such a posting does not enable that person to 'prevent a particular recipient from receiving the information.'\\" See alsoReferencesExternal links=Media coverage * James Nash, State high court upholds Net law to protect kids, The Columbus Dispatch (Jan. 28, 2010). * Laura A.

Sainte-Croix-du-Mont is an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) for sweet white wine from the Bordeaux wine region in France. Geography Vineyard seen from church square The wine-growing area is located in the Aquitaine region of France and surrounds the commune of Sainte-Croix-du-Mont in the Gironde department. It is located on the right bank of the Garonne river, in the Entre-Deux-Mers subregion of Bordeaux. Appellation The appellation extends over and the grape varieties grown are S√©millon, Sauvignon and Muscadelle. It has a good geographical location for producing wine affected by noble rot as many of the vineyards grow next to rivers and are therefore likely to be affected by the Botrytis cinerea fungus in the autumn. The noble rot increases the sugar content, acidity, and glycerol content of the grape clusters. The wines from Sainte-Croix-du-Mont are similar in style to the more famous wines from Sauternes on the other side of the Garonne. In similarity to Sauternes, they can be kept for several decades. The Syndicat Viticole de Sainte-Croix-du-Mont (Wine-growers Union of Sainte-Croix-du-Mont) is responsible for managing the use of the Sainte-Croix-du-Mont AOC and has managed the related internet site since 2007.

In the , Samsonvale had a population of 590 people. Geography The district is dominated by Lake Samsonvale, the waters of North Pine Dam, one of the three main water-suppliers to the metropolitan region. Samsonvale sits below the highest peak in the area, Mount Samson.  History  View of Mount Samson from Golds Scrub Lane Samsonvale was occupied by the indigenous people, who named the area Tukuwompa. British settlement of Samsonvale began with the Samsonvale pastoral run established in 1845 by the Joyner family and the locality takes its name from the pastoral run. The nearby suburb of Joyner is named after the family. The history of Samsonvale is one of forced resumptions with three quarters of the Joyner's original pastoral run in the 1860s being taken from them. Samsonvale Provisional School opened on 1 June 1875. It closed on 1880. In 1918 the Dayboro railway line reached Samford with the Samford railway station opening on 1 July 1918; the line would finally reach its terminus at Dayboro railway station on 25 September 1920. In 1955 the line closed from Ferny Grove to Dayboro, closing the Samford railway station. The remaining Ferny Grove railway line is now only a passenger service within the City of Brisbane with Ferny Grove railway station being the closest rail connection from Samford. A little over one hundred years later, the district's farming families were once again be forced from their farms, this time to allow for the construction of the North Pine Dam. For the first half of the last Century Samsonvale was predominantly a dairy farming community centered on a station on the Dayboro railway line. The construction of the North Pine Dam and the flooding of Lake Samsonvale in the 1970s caused a series of forced resumptions of family farms. The flooding of the Lake also closed the Presbyterian Church, community hall, and post office. All that remains today at the site of the old village is a cemetery with much of the former district underwater, along with the original Samsonvale pastoral run and much of the district's best farming land. Mount Samson State School opened on 9 August 1880. The current Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade facility sits above what was once the center of the Kobble Creek community. In 2006, during a drought seeing water levels of Lake Samsonvale falling to unprecedented lows, archeological works were considered by the local council to preserve historic artifacts from flooded homesteads dating back to the 19th Century. In 2010 Lake Samsonvale was once again filled to capacity, covering the historical sites and much of the district's best farming land. The area around the cemetery has a large biodiversity, with over 250 species of bird recorded. Demographics In the , Samsonvale recorded a population of 555 people, 49.2% female and 50.8% male. The median age of the Samsonvale population was 38 years, 1 year above the national median of 37. 83.8% of people living in Samsonvale were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 6.1%, New Zealand 1.8%, Germany 0.9%, Papua New Guinea 0.9%, South Africa 0.7%. 94.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1.4% German, 0.7% Arabic, 0.7% Spanish, 0.5% French.

They are relatively small free- living flatworms, inhabiting freshwater and marine environments. There are about 100 species described worldwide, but the simple anatomy makes species distinction problematic. Description The anatomy of catenulids is simple and lacks hard parts. The mouth is located anteriorly and connects to a simple pharynx and a simple intestine that forms a ciliated sac. They possess two pairs of nerve cords and often a statocyst, as well as a single protonephridium. The gonads are unpaired. Unusually, the male gonopore opens on the dorsal surface of the animal, above the pharynx, while the female reproductive system lacks any of the usual ducts and related structures found in other flatworms. The sperm is nonmobile and lacks flagella or cilia. Asexual reproduction by paratomy is common, and it usually leads to a chain of organisms (zooids), hence the name, from Latin catenula, small chain. Members of the symbiotic genus Paracatenula lack a digestive tract, and instead harbor intracellular chemoautotrophic bacterial symbionts that are assumed to provide their nutrition.  Ecology  All catenulids are aquatic, benthic animals. Most of them live in freshwater, being usually very abundant in mires, ponds, streams and moist terrestrial habitats. A small number of species are known to live in the sea. The diet of most catenulids consists of small invertebrates and algae that they capture from the water column. Others, such as those of the genus Paracatenula use chemoautotrophic bacterial symbionts that live inside their cells as a food source.  Phylogeny  The monophyly of Catenulida is supported by molecular studies and by at least 3 synapomorphies: the unpaired protonephridium, the unpaired and anterodorsally located testis and the nonmobile sperm. Although there are no known synapomorphies connecting Catenulida to other flatworms (Rhabditophora), molecular studies indicate that they are sister-groups. All characters common to both clades, such as the internal fertilization and the simple gut with a single opening, are found in other groups as well.
