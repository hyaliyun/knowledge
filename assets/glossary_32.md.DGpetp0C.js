Traditional solar cells are composed of p-type and n-type semiconductor layers sandwiched together, forming the source of built-in voltage (a p-n junction). Due to differing energy levels between the Fermi level of the metal and the conduction band of the semiconductor, an abrupt potential difference is created, instead of the smooth band transition observed across a p-n junction in a standard solar cell, and this is a Schottky height barrier. Although vulnerable to higher rates of thermionic emission, manufacturing of Schottky barrier solar cells proves to be cost-effective and industrially scalable. However, research has shown thin insulating layers between metal and semiconductors improve solar cell performance, generating interest in metal- insulator-semiconductor Schottky junction solar cells. A thin insulating layer, such as silicon dioxide, can reduce rates of electron-hole pair recombination and dark current by allowing the possibility of minority carriers to tunnel through this layer. The Schottky-junction is an attempt to increase the efficiency of solar cells by introducing an impurity energy level in the band gap. This impurity can absorb more lower energy photons, which improves the power conversion efficiency of the cell. This type of solar cell allows enhanced light trapping and faster carrier transport compared to more conventional photovoltaic cells. Fig. 2: Band diagram of Schottky junction Material types Schottky junction solar cells can be constructed using many different material types. =Cadmium selenide= One material is cadmium selenide. As a direct bandgap semiconductor, CdSe has many applications in modern technology. Previous experiments using CdSe in solar cells resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of approximately 0.72%. Liang Li et al. propose using single cadmium selenide nanobelts-on-electrodes. This method uses electron-beam lithography, or EBL, which provides a more efficient synthesis method to developing Schottky junction solar cells. Although this material does not provide a large power-conversion efficiency as of yet, the advent of simpler fabrication methods show promise in nano-electronic applications. Further research is being conducted to increase the efficiency of cadmium selenide cells. =Nickel oxide= When constructing bulk-heterojunction solar cells, p-type nickel oxide is an effective anode layer. Its function as a wide band-gap semiconductor helps planarize the anode surface, and helps maximum photon flu to reach the active layer. In this case, NiO thickness was also measured, and increasing the thickness decreases cell efficiency. In these cells, nickel oxide replaces poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, or PEDOT:PSS, resulting in a dramatic increases in performance while still maintaining stability of the cell. Compared to the cadmium selenide cell, nickel dioxide cells provide a power-conversion efficiency to 5.2%. =Gallium arsenide= Fig. 3: Power conversion efficiency of different compositions of Schottky junctions. Under the right conditions, a gallium arsenide cell can produce an efficiency of around 22%. This is considered an MIS, or metal-insulator-semiconductor, and requires a thin oxide layer to prevent photo-current suppression. Sheng S. Li et al. for the first time show that an effective barrier height equal to the band gap energy can be realized if the thickness and dopant density of the p-layer as well as the dopant density in the n substrate are properly chosen.

Lu was trained in Chinese traditional art and calligraphy, collectively known as guohua or \\"traditional painting\\". Lu's additional formal training in Western art allowed him to create both impressionistic and expressionistic forms. He was ease with both classical and experimental styles and combined both Chinese and Western methods. Lu was also a seal carver, an author, an art historian, Feng Shui practitioner, astrologer, and geomancer. Lu produced numerous works of modern and traditional Chinese art as he migrated from China to Taiwan to Singapore,  Biography  Born in Jiangsu Province, China, Lu started to experiment with art when he was four and his formal training began at six. Starting with calligraphy as his foundation, Lu's talents were discovered and guided by the Chinese calligrapher, Wang Xiechen. Lu's older brother, also an artist, guided him on decorative design. Lu later joined Central University of Nanjing to expand his artistic repertoire to include Western painting. Pu Ru was one of Lu's teachers. Pu was a supporter of Lu and contributed a calligraphyPu's Chinese Title of Face Painting in Chinese Opera of the Chinese title of Lu's book, \\"Face Painting in Chinese Opera.\\"Face Painting in Chinese Opera by Steve Lu, Google Books Additionally, Pu dedicated a painting to Lu.Pu Ru‚Äôs dedication to Lu Another teacher, Yu Youren, a calligrapher, also dedicated a calligraphy to Lu.Yu Youren‚Äôs dedication to Lu When Zhang Daqian visited Singapore in 1956, he spent an entire month with Lu to share some art insights and skills including Zhang's famous \\"three whites\\" of Chinese beauties. \\"Three whites\\" refer to the parts of the face where there are no colors such as the forehead, nose and chin. Zhang, an animal lover and pet owner of several different types of monkeys, guided Lu on the techniques of painting monkeys. According to Zhang, the secret to painting monkeys is not in the monkeys, but the trees they climb on. Zhang visited Singapore again in 1963 when Lu was a patron for Zhang's exhibition. During that time, Zhang autographed and gave Lu his photo with Picasso during their 1956 summit meeting in Nice, France.Zhang‚Äôs photo with Picasso gifted to Lu Zhang also gave Lu a calligraphy to commemorate their personal friendship.Zhang Daqian‚Äôs dedication to Lu Wu Zishen, who dedicated a calligraphy to Lu in 1967,Wu Zishen‚Äôs dedication to Lu said: \\"Steve Lu, the great art teacher of artists, unites the best of ancient and modern Chinese and western art.\\" Wu (1893-1972), the founder of Suzhou Art Academy in 1928, was an artist, calligrapher and poet. He was also a doctor of the traditional Chinese school of medicine.  Artistic career  Lu's calligraphy works include various ancient rudimentary calligraphy styles. Those were written on tortoise shell and bone in the Shang Dynasty (11-16th century BC) or on metal or stone. His calligraphy ranged from a \\"square style\\" of writing to scrawl and modern styles such as xingshu (running style) and caoshu (cursive style). An example of Lu's unorthodox approach is his 3,420 variations of Á¶è or fu, \\"good fortune.\\"Why fu comes in 3,000 ways, Straits Times, January 22, 1986, Singapore For years, Lu studied how calligraphers wrote this word. In his exploration, Lu found new ways of writing it by combining the left radical of the word by Wang Xizhi (a calligrapher in Jin Dynasty, AD 265-420) with the right component of the word by Su Dongpo (writer, AD 1036-1101). After spending decades developing and writing them, Lu finally completed the artwork of 3,420 variants of fu in 12 paintings in 1984.

Education Richard Sander was born on May 26, 1956 in Washington, D.C. He received his B.A. in Social Studies from Harvard University in 1978, his M.A. in Economics from Northwestern University in 1985, his J.D. from Northwestern in 1988, and his Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern in 1990. Career Following his undergraduate degree in social studies, Sander became involved with the federal Vista program working with a housing group on the south side of Chicago. During his graduate studies at Northwestern, Sander served on the board of the Rogers Park Tenants Committee and was involved in the election effort of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. Sander joined the UCLA School of Law faculty in 1989, and became a full professor there five years later. As in Chicago, in the 1990s Sander was involved in fair housing efforts in Los Angeles. He was the President of the Fair Housing Congress of Southern California, and in 1996 founded the Fair Housing Institute, helping City of Los Angeles design and implement its living wage law. Work on affirmative action=Studies= Sander is known for his research on affirmative action, which claims that it actually causes more negatives than benefits for African American law students by hurting them due to the overly competitive environments in more prestigious schools, through what he calls the \\"mismatch effect\\". He published his research in a 2004 article in Stanford Law Review where he claimed that if minority students had been admitted into less-competitive schools for which they would qualify for without affirmative action, they would have been more successful. He has also published studies suggesting that law firms' efforts to promote diversity sometimes led to them hiring underqualified black lawyers, leading to these lawyers being more likely than their better-credentialed white counterparts to leave the firm. His research is controversial and has been widely criticized, including by Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks. Ayres and Brooks published a study in 2005 finding that eliminating affirmative action would not increase the number of black lawyers by 7.9 percent, as Sander's study had claimed, but that it would instead reduce the number of lawyers by about 12.7 percent. A 2008 study by Jesse Rothstein and Albert H. Yoon confirmed Sander's mismatch findings, but also found that eliminating affirmative action would \\"lead to a 63 percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools.\\" These high numbers predictions were doubted in the National Bureau of Economic Research article by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim; a lower, 32.5 percent was another decrease cited and considered in the article. Their 2016 article found a strong indication that racial preference results in a mismatch effect. They argued that the attendance by some African-American students to less-selective schools would significantly improve the low first attempt rate at passing the state bar, but they cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance. In 2006, and in order to gain further research information regarding his mis match theory, excepting individuals privacy information, Sander requested the California Bar to release its stored data of bar exam scores, grade point averages and LSAT scores including race and gender information of everyone who applied to the bar association. The bar denied this request based on privacy grounds. In 2008, and along with the First Amendment Coalition, Sander filed a lawsuit in California Supreme Court demanding the release of that information. On April 12, 2016 the court ruled that the California Bar was required to oblige with Sander's request. Based on related legal issues, as of May 2016, that information has yet to be released. In 2015, Sander filed a Brief Amicus Curiae In Support of Neither Party in regards to the affirmative action issue addressed by Supreme Court of the United States in Fisher v. University of Texas (2016). =Book= Sander has also co-written a book, along with Stuart Taylor, Jr., entitled Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended to Help, and Why Universities Won't Admit It. which expresses similar views on affirmative action as his research. The book was reviewed favorably in the New Republic by Richard Kahlenberg, who called it \\"perceptive\\" and said that it \\"presents a nuanced treatment of the issue\\".

It was designed by architects Dennis & Dennis. The nearby Telfair County Jail was built in 1902. The courthouse and jail were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History Telfair county, named for Governor Edward Telfair, was established in 1807. Its first two courthouses, one of log, the other a two- story wooden building, were located in the original county seat at Jacksonville. Jacksonville, with its plantation economy and river landing, was replaced as county seat in 1870 by McRae, located on the Macon and Brunswick Railroad. . The third courthouse, the first in McRae, was a frame building built in 1872 or 1873, and was replaced by a brick courthouse in 1888. That courthouse burned around 1900 and was replaced by Telfair's fifth courthouse, again of brick, in 1904. It burned in 1934 and was replaced by the current, sixth, courthouse later that year using the walls of the 1904 building. The jail was built in 1902 near the eventual location of the 1904 courthouse. It was the first brick jail in the county. Architecture The courthouse, in the Colonial Revival-style, is a two-story brick building. The main entrance features three arched entryways and an in antis portico. The side and rear entrances are pedimented with transoms and double doors. The jail is a two- story brick building with hipped roof, four chimneys, center front gable, and an enclosed front porch. There is decorative brick detailing along the cornice. The Macon, Georgia architecture firm of Dennis & Dennis designed the courthouse, as well as the Emanuel County and Peach County courthouses, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Production=Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.

It was a small community founded in 1911, in an area which at the time was outside the city limits of Peoria. The area is located within the pockets of unincorporated land under the jurisdiction of Maricopa County. All of the census and demographic data for the residents of Weedville are part of the information reported for the city of Peoria since Weedville is located within the limits of that city. History Reverend Ora Rush Weed (1868‚Äì1942) was a Methodist minister from Kansas. It is unknown why Weed decided to leave his hometown with his wife Phoebe and family. They moved and settled in Arizona. Some of the members of his Kansas ministry followed him and together they homesteaded the area north of Thunderbird Road and 75th Avenue, outside of what at the time were the city limits of Peoria.Pulling Up WeedvilleHistoric Peoria PlacesPeoria Local Links and Resources By 1916, Weed established the Path Church (now known as the \\"Old Path Church\\") and a boarding school. The name \\"Paths\\" comes from a Bible verse (Jeremiah 6:16): \\"Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\\" graveyard of artifacts tells West Valley‚Äôs story A small religious community flourished around the development of Weedville, which Weed named after himself. By 1921, the community established a cemetery which was named the Old Paths Cemetery. Besides running a small general store, Weed ran a farm which produced broom grass. He then established a broom factory using the broom grass. He employed many ex-convicts who had gained experience as broom makers in prison. As such the factory helped support the small community economically. Later years Weed donated land and buildings for the establishment of the Southwest Indian School. Today the site is home to the Southwest Indian School Ministries. The Old Path Church is still standing and is located within the grounds of the ministry. Rev. Ora Weed died on May 4, 1942.

She was the first woman from Maine to practice law. She was the National Vice Chairman of the women‚Äôs suffrage movement and the President of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women‚Äôs Clubs. She was posthumously inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1991.http://bpwmefoundation.org/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2015/12/Maine-Womans-Hall-of-fame-brochure-2015.pdf  Early years  Gail Laughlin was born in Robbinston, Maine to Robert Laughlin and Elizabeth (Stuart) Laughlin. She was one of nine children. Her mother was from St. Stephen, New Brunswick and her father was from Belfast, Ireland. Her father passed at the age of 56 in 1876, leaving her mother and six siblings behind, as two died in infancy. The family returned to Laughlin‚Äôs mother‚Äôs hometown of St. Stephen, New Brunswick for financial support from extended family. In 1880, the family relocated to Portland, Maine where Laughlin's eldest brother was working as a clerk. With the financial support of her brothers, Gail Laughlin was able to attend Portland High School.  Education  Laughlin graduated from Portland High School in 1886 honors. She received the Brown Medal award for earning the highest grades of all the girls in her graduating class. She was awarded a partial scholarship to Colby College, but could not afford to attend. She entered the workforce and began saving for Wellesley College, her dream school. Laughlin's first job was working at a china imports office as a bookkeeper where she made four dollars a week. After saving enough money, she began to attend Wellesley College. There, she started and was president of the Agora Society that focused on expanding students knowledge on politics. Before graduation, she gave a speech to members of the Agora Society on the Wilson tariff bill that was published on the front cover of the American Economist by the Home Market Bulletin. She received fifty dollars for the publication that would go towards furthering her education. In 1894, Laughlin received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wellesley. After her graduation, she was offered a job working as an editorial writer for the American Economist. This job allowed her to save money and pursue her dreams of working in law and politics. After working at the American Economist for two years, Gail saved enough money to apply to Cornell Law school. During her interview with the school she was told that she would only be accepted if there were open seats that men could not occupy. She and three other females were accepted to Cornell Law School in 1896 with their 123 male classmates. Two years later, in 1898, she graduated from Cornell Law School with an LL.B. Gail Laughlin passed the New York bar exam in 1899 and opened her first law office in 1900.  Career  Laughlin was the first woman from Maine to practice law. Her office in New York did not thrive with the challenges she had hoped to face. She was offered and accepted a job by Colonel Albert Clark, the man responsible for publishing her speech in the American Economist, to inspect the working conditions of domestic servants with the United States Industrial Commission. It was her job to inspect, observe, and report on the working conditions of those employed in domestic service in an attempt to improve the working conditions of employees. After two years of research she published a twenty-eight-page report for the United States Industrial Commission outlining the injustices that women of multiple demographics faced in domestic service. Laughlin learned that women were being paid less than men for equal work and faced many unreasonable demands. Her work with the United States Industrial Commission inspired her to devote some of her life the Women's suffrage movement. She spent the next four years of her life (1902-1906) campaigning for the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Laughlin traveled the west promoting the vote and equal rights for women. In 1906 she landed in Denver, Colorado where they had the right to vote since 1893. She opened her second law office in Denver in 1906. She spent her time in Denver serving on eleven city and state boards. During her time in Colorado, she befriended Dr. Marguerite Sperry who convinced her to return to Marguerite's native California. The two were life partners from 1903 until 1919 when Dr. Sperry died. Sperry's ashes are buried with Laughlin in Maine.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98763667/gail-laughlin Laughlin opened her third law office in 1914 in San Francisco, California. There she served on the Republican state central committee, became a member of the National Women's Party, was a judge in the police courts, was one of the founders of the National League for Women's Services, and drafted and passed a law allowing women to be on juries in California. In 1919, Laughlin traveled to St. Louis, Missouri to attend the first convention of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs of which she was a co- founder. The purpose of this meeting was to unite women and focus on the inequalities women face in the workforce. At the convention Laughlin gave the opening speech. She was a unifying symbol for the suffrage movement. She was elected as the president of National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs at the end of the convention. Laughlin grew homesick for her native New England. She returned to Portland, Maine in 1924. She began practicing law with her brother Frederick. In 1927, Laughlin was working to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. The bill was downed, but not out and she needed to draw some major attention to it. She and 200 others traveled to the Rapid City, South Dakota to corner President Coolidge and get a massive amount of media attention. The goal was to get the bill into the next session, but President Coolidge announced he wouldn't be running for a second term and did not provide any support. Laughlin wanted to have more of an impact on Maine and the impact landed on her desk. The Women's Literacy Union drafted a petition with 1,000 signatures on it for Ms. Laughlin to run for the Maine State Legislature. In 1929, she was elected to the Maine Legislature and served three terms During her time with the Maine Legislature, she submitted many bills and passed a few laws all surrounding the well being of women. She worked successfully to raise the minimum marriage age of girls from thirteen to sixteen and passed an act preventing the wrongful commitment of women into mental institutions. She continued to work on increasing wages for women, decreasing the demanding hours women worked, allowing to women to work at night and after marriage, and for women to be included on juries. Laughlin moved up to the state senate in 1935 and served until 1941. After the Senate, Laughlin became the first women recorder of court decisions, where she worked until 1945.  Later life  Laughlin continued to work as a lawyer until 1948, when she suffered a minor stroke at 78. In 1952, she suffered a second stroke and died at the age of 83. She was posthumously inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1991.

It premiered on FOX on March 2, 2015 and was written by Megan Mostyn- Brown, and directed by Bill Eagles. In this episode, after Commissioner Loeb's (Peter Scolari) controversial moves, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) looks for a solution to the problem. Meanwhile, Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) comes face to face with the prison's director. The episode was watched by 6.10 million viewers and received positive reviews, with critics praising the twist ending and corruption themes. Plot Alfred (Sean Pertwee) wakes up in the hospital but refuses to tell James Gordon (Ben McKenzie) that Reggie Payne was responsible for his stabbing. In the prison's nursery, Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) is visited by Dr. Francis Dulmacher (Colm Feore). Mooney wants to be his second-hand, based on her experiences with Falcone (John Doman). Dulmacher gives Mooney a new sky-blue irised eye, and gives Mooney the opportunity to prove herself worthy of working as his right hand woman. Gordon discovers from Essen (Zabryna Guevara) and Dent (Nicholas D'Agosto) that Commissioner Loeb (Peter Scolari) has released Arnold Flass (Dash Mihok) from jail. When he confronts Loeb, Loeb shows him a video of the witness: Bullock (Donal Logue). Bullock was blackmailed by Loeb because, on Falcone's orders he was directed to kill a rival mobster, and, unlike Gordon, he executed the man. Gordon and Dent question an ex-partner of Loeb's, Charlie Griggs (Michael J. Burg), where they get an address for a Triad bookmaker named Xi Lu (Perry Yung). Gordon and Dent arrive at a Chinese restaurant and find Xi Lu and his bookmaking operations. When Lu denies any involvement, Dent threatens him, which prompts Lu to send his employees to kill them. They're saved by Bullock, who realizes Griggs lied to them. After nearly killing him, Griggs reveals Loeb has ties with Falcone. After receiving help from Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), they arrive at a farm owned by Loeb. There, they find a couple, Jude (Dan Ziskie) and Marge (Becky Ann Baker) keeping the house. Jim and Harvey claim to be inspectors for Loeb, but Jude and Marge open fire which ends with Jude being shot by Bullock and Marge knocked unconscious. In the attic of the farm house, they discover Loeb's daughter Miriam (Nicholle Tom) locked up. When they question her, she reveals she killed Loeb's wife years before. Gordon then visits Loeb in his office, threatening to expose his lies unless he sends Flass back to jail, and erases Bullock's history. Loeb agrees only with Bullock's terms as ratting out his other blackmailees would endanger his life. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) tries to ask Kringle (Chelsea Spack) for a date but is heartbroken, as he realizes she has a boyfriend, Officer Tom Dougherty (Zachary Spicer). Cobblepot brings Jude and Marge to the nightclub so they can get relocated before Loeb kills them. When Cobblepot reveals he only has one getaway ticket to Arizona, Marge kills Jude. Cobblepot then reveals that he lied and kills Marge. Mooney later sees that Dulmacher altered the office manager's (Jeffrey Combs) body to female parts. She is later forced to give some of the inmates to Dulmacher so that they can come to terms. Later, while in his office, Mooney is shocked when she finds out the prison is on an island, making her escape even more difficult.

Despite the fact that the show often seems to forget the big moments that have already happened on it. As in, Gordon and Bullock already walked into a no-win situation, almost ready to die, in the midseason finale. So while this was a good mission, it still paled in comparison to the danger they faced there. Likewise, it seemed like Gordon already learned his lesson when it came to dealing with Cobblepot. But now it appears he'll have to learn it all over again.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"What largely makes the episode work is that it presents a complex, but not convoluted narrative, which deepens our understanding of a handful of central characters and the city of Gotham. The show has always been billed as one that's not about Batman, but rather about the city that produced the caped crusader. Much of this season hasn't told us anything meaningful about Gotham though, or given us an understanding of the details and personality of the city. By focusing on corruption within the GCPD, and how that corruption extends to the city and its criminal underground, 'Everyone Has a Cobblepot' gives us an understanding of Gotham that's been lacking all season.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Everyone Has a Cobblepot"},{"id":"49235122","text":"Lundeberg is a Swedish surname that may refer to *√Öke Lundeberg (1888‚Äì1939), Swedish sports shooter *Christian Lundeberg (1842‚Äì1911), Swedish politician *Harry Lundeberg (1901‚Äì1957), American merchant seaman and labor leader *Helen Lundeberg (1908‚Äì1999), American painter *Philip K.

History  In the second quarter of 1946. the late Mr. Roberto T. Tirona, Assistant Principal of Cavite High School (now Cavite National High School), Cavite City, proposed the idea of creating a junior high school in Kawit, Cavite to his immediate superior, Mr. Palaypay, as well as to Mr. Mr. Roman Lorenzo, Division Schools Superintendent at that time. This was in view of the over increasing enrollment of students coming from the towns of Noveleta, Kawit, Bacoor, Imus, Dasmarinas and Silang in Cavite which the Cavite High School could hardly accommodate. Moreover, Senator Emiliano Tria Tirona promised to allocate his Pork Barrel Fund of P500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand Pesos) for the construction of the school building and payment for the school site once the proposal was approved. Eventually, the Kawit High School, with a faculty of 29 teachers and student population of 1, 200 was temporarily opened in June 1947 at the convent of the Kawit Parish Church (now Saint Mary Magdalene Parish). In 1948, the kawit Junior High School became a fully-fledged high school and was renamed Kawit High School. It turned our its first graduates in 1949. On April 5, 1950, the classes of Kawit High School were transferred to its new site at Gahak, Kawit, Cavite. It was renamed to Emiliano Tria Tirona Memorial National High School, in honor to its benefactor. In 1962, the school was converted into a national high school through the efforts of the late Congressman Justiniano Montano and school principal, Mr. Guillermo Florencio.

History  Taylor Made was founded in 1976 by then-19-year-old Duncan Taylor and his business partner Mike Shannon as a broodmare boarding farm, and initially was located on a parcel of leased land on Gainesway Farm. Gainesway Farm used Taylor Made as a place to board mares that traveled to Kentucky to be bred. The Taylor brothers, Duncan, Ben, Frank, and Mark grew up living and working on Gainesway Farm with their father, Joe Taylor, the farm's manager, and also learned about the horse business from their grandfather. In 1978, the business broadened to include sales when they consigned horses at the Keeneland Sales. By 2012, Taylor Made was consigning approximately 10% of the Keeneland's September yearling sale‚àíabout 345 yearlings out of the entire sales catalog of 3,604. As Taylor Made grew, the horses were kept on leased property and barns throughout Central Kentucky. They expanded into sales consignments and then built their own facility on a 120-acre piece of property owned by Joe Taylor on Union Mill Road in Nicholasville, Kentucky.  Operation  Frank Taylor, 2016 Taylor Made is divided into two separate companies: Taylor Made Sales Agency, and Taylor Made Stallions Inc.

It was foundedhttp://www.madridhistorico.com/seccion5_historia/nivel2_informacion.php?idmapa=9&idinformacion;=685&pag;=2 in 1611 by the community of the Fathers Canons Premonstratensians with the permission of Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo Bernardo de Rojas and financed by a benefactor, the Count of Miranda, Juan of Z√∫√±iga, the then president of the Council of Castile. Today the site of the convent is occupied by a market built in the 19th century, known as Mercado de los Mostenses.  History  Its church had been rebuilt in 1754 by architect Ventura Rodr√≠guez, for be the previous ruined. It had a beautiful convex fa√ßade flanked by two towers, but was victim of the unbridled plan of opening of plazas of the king Joseph Bonaparte (nicknamed Pepe Plazuelas precisely for this reason). First it was demolished the convent in April 1810, but in May of the same year also was issued order to demolish the church. However, the architects who were commissioned to direct this operation, Silvestre P√©rez (royal architect) and Juan Antonio Cuervo refused, because the artistic value of the work it joined that both had been disciples of self Ventura Rodr√≠guez. However, their negative reports were of no avail and in 1811 a new royal order finished by tearing down what that left of the building. In 1875 was inaugurated on its site the Former Mercado de los Mostenses work by Mariano Calvo Pereira, and twin to the Former Mercado de la Cebada, although somewhat smaller dimensions. In turn, this new building (a remarkable work of architecture of iron in the city) was demolished in 1925 to build the Gran V√≠a, being realized a realignment of the route, placing the current market further north, and locating in the site original office and housing buildings (including the one that housed the closed Cine Azul -originally Cine Belusia-).  Description  The convent originally built in the then Calle de la Inquisici√≥n, occupying another convent-church that had left the nuns of St. Catherine of Siena to move to another building on the Plaza de las Cortes de Madrid. Besides the work of Ventura Rodr√≠guez, architecturally also highlighted the early church, with a main fa√ßade composed with a semicircular portico flanked by two towers decorated with Corinthian columns. The portico had three entrances with four Ionic columns and on this, rose a second crowned body with a statue of St. Norbert, made of granite from Colmenar Viejo by sculptor Manuel √Ålvarez.Historias de Madrid, 1952, Manuel Iglesias, Editorial I.

He developed practical public health programs for the poor in Medell√≠n. The increasing violence and human rights abuses of the 1970s and 1980s led him to fight for social justice in his community, but his political views put him at odds with those in power and Abad was killed in 1987. He and other great defenders of the human rights of the time shows us the importance of standing up against injustice and fight for the respect for human rights, despite staggering opposition.

Thoughts of H√©ctor Abad G√≥mez 1\\\\. Either we behave like intelligent and rational animals, having respect for nature and accelerating wherever possible our incipient process of humanization, or the quality of life deteriorates. 2\\\\. There is no doubt that we are living through a period in history in which groups of people ‚Äì ethically superior to us ‚Äì do not accept as natural the fact that these situations of inequality and injustice should go on. Their fight against the 'establishment' is a hard and dangerous fight. They must confront the anger and unease of the most powerful political and economic groups. They must face the consequences, even those incompatible with their own peace and possibilities; incompatible with attaining so-called success in established society. 'But there is an inner force that impels them to work in favour of those who need their help. For many of them, this force has become their reason for living. This struggle gives meaning to their lives. Living is justified if the world is a little better when one dies, as a result of one's work and efforts. To live simply for pleasure is a legitimate animal ambition. But for human beings, for Homo sapiens, it is to be content with very little. In order to distinguish ourselves from other animals, in order to justify our time on this earth, we must aspire to goals superior to the mere enjoyment of life. The fixation on goals distinguishes some men from others. And here the most important thing is not to achieve those goals, but to fight for them. We cannot all be the protagonists of history. We are all merely cells in the universal human body, but we should be aware that each of us can do something to improve the world in which we live and in which those who come after us will live. We must work for the present and for the future, and this will bring us more happiness than simple pleasure in material goods. 3\\\\. The knowledge that we are contributing to building a better world must be the highest of human aspirations. 4\\\\. People dedicated to cultivate intellect, also ideas of peace and justice are feeling that they can help the welfare of all human beings, regardless of race, religion or nationality. These people feel that they have a mission they have to fulfill. They Know that the world will never come to Utopia. They know people will never stop working to get a little closer than now, to the fulfillment of higher expectations. But they pass the torch and the flag to the successive generations, hoping that, as days pass by, equality, justice, freedom, and love between humans get better. That, as mentioned before, gives meaning to their lives.

The north shore of the bend is on the Kuybyshev Reservoir, the south side is on the Saratov Reservoir, and on the north it has a border with Zhiguli Nature Reserve. The park is culturally important because of its centrality to a range of peoples back to ancient times, and to its scientific value resulting from the biodiversity of its closely placed variety of habitats. The territory is part of the Middle Volga Complex Biosphere. Topography The Samara Bend is located at the meeting zone of two geological regions: the Volga Uplands, and the Lower Volga Lowlands. In the Volga Uplands, a region of hills on the East European Plain, the park is found on the northeast edge. Across the Volga on the left bank are the Volga Lowlands, a tectonic trough of clay and sand remaining from the ancient Caspian Sea. The Kuybyshev and Saratov reservoirs of the Volga form the north and south borders of the park. The Samara Bend of the Volga River. The Samarskaya Luka National Park (false color) covers the entire peninsula, except for the middle north section (full green), which is the strict nature reserve Zhuigili The Volga's detour around the Zhiguli mountains is almost 200 km in length. The Zhiguli, and most of the bedrock in the park, is a karst (limestone) formation, averaging about 300 meters in height. About 18% of the Samara Bend National Park is in the mountainous Zhiguli on the north, 8% is on Volga floodplains to the south, and the remainder is forest and forest-steppe. In the eastern part of the park, the weathering of the limestone has left more than 500 craters over 1 meter to 100 meters in width, and 1 meter to 20 meters in depth. Ecoregion and Climate Samarskaya Luka lies in the East European forest steppe ecoregion (WWF ID#419), a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south, cutting across the middle of Eastern Europe from Bulgaria through Russia. This forest steppe ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate in Samarskaya Luka is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The coldest month is January (-10 C on average); the warmest month is July (+20 C). Average precipitation is 556 mm. The frost-free period is 156 days. The predominant winds are from the southwest. Flora Because of the complexity and centrality of the habitats, biodiversity is high. Plant communities include Eastern European steppe, steppe pine forests, Eastern European deciduous forests, grasslands, and floodplains. Over 1,500 species of vascular plants have been recorded in the park's borders. The trees are almost all deciduous - 97%, with linden, oak and birch the most common. The 3% conifers are in small stands of sparse Scots pine found on the higher slopes and on limestone.

Originally described as Boletus lepidus in 1965, the fungus has gone through controversial taxonomic treatments over the years and was subsequently transferred to genus Krombholziella in 1985, to genus Leccinum in 1990, and to genus Leccinellum in 2003. It is the sister-species of Leccinellum corsicum, with which it had been erroneously synonymised by some authors in the past. Like other species of Boletaceae, it has tubes and pores instead of gills in its hymenial (fertile) surface and produces large, fleshy fruit bodies up to 20 cm across. Fruit bodies have the tendency to stain orange, violaceous grey and eventually blackish brown when handled or when the flesh is exposed to the air. Native to southern Europe, L. lepidum is abundantly present throughout the Mediterranean, growing in mycorrhizal symbiosis with various species of oak (Quercus), particularly evergreen members of the \\"Ilex\\" group. Despite its southern distribution, the fungus is notable for its late fruiting and tolerance to low temperatures, and is often the only bolete fruiting during the cold winter months. It is an edible mushroom, though not as highly regarded as sought-after boletes of the genus Boletus. Taxonomy and phylogeny Originally described as Boletus lepidus by H. Essette in 1965,Essette (1965). Bull. trimest. Soc. mycol. Fr.: pl. 147 Leccinellum lepidum has been controversially treated by various authors, who placed it in different genera or at times synonymised it with other taxa. In 1985, the species was invalidly recombined into genus Leccinum by mycologists Marcel Bon and Marco Contu, but later in the same year Italian mycologist Carlo Alessio transferred it to Krombholziella,Alessio CL. (1985). Boletus Dill. ex L. (sensu lato): 1-712 a genus that later became a synonym of Leccinum. Bon recombined it as a variety of Leccinum crocipodium in 1989,Bon M. (1989). Novitates - Nouveaux taxons. Documents Mycologiques. 19(75): 55‚Äì58. only to recombine it again with M. Contu as Leccinum lepidum, in 1990.Quadraccia L, Rossi W. (1984). Novitates - Combinaisons et taxons nouveaux. Documents Mycologiques. 14(56): 27-32. Heinz Engel and colleagues, on the other hand, rejected all previous names and considered the taxon to be a synonym of Leccinum corsicum, a closely related species associated with Cistaceae shrubs. In 2003, the species was transferred to the newly segregated genus Leccinellum by mycologists Andreas Bresinsky and Manfred Binder, together with other yellow-pored taxa formerly placed in Leccinum. Subsequent phylogenetic and chemotaxonomical analyses by Binder & Besl and Den Bakker & Noordeloos, questioned the segregation of Leccinellum, but suggested that L. lepidum, L. corsicum and L. crocipodium are probably distinct species. However, the three taxa were initially represented by very few sequences and the inclusive \\"corsicum/lepidum\\" clade received high support in preliminary phylogenetic analyses. In a 2014 paper, Bertolini controversially abandoned Leccinellum and placed L. lepidum in synonymy with L. corsicum once again, only for the genus to be reinstated in the same year by Wu and colleagues, in a major contribution delineating 22 generic clades in the family Boletaceae. The confusion was finally clarified in 2019, when several collections from Corsica, Croatia, Cyprus, France and Greece were analysed in an elaborate phylogenetic, biogeographical and ecological treatment by M. Loizides and colleagues. In this study, Leccinellum was phylogenetically validated, while L. lepidum, L. corsicum and L. crocipodium formed well-supported lineages within the genus, and were consequently confirmed as distinct species. =Etymology= The Latin epithet l√®pidus, meaning \\"pleasant\\" or \\"charming\\", likely refers to the appearance or culinary qualities of the fungus. Description=Macromorphology= Leccinellum lepidum produces large, fleshy fruit bodies. The cap is at first hemispherical, gradually becoming convex or convex-flat as the fungus expands, reaching a diameter of . The cap cuticle is smooth to somewhat lobed and often with a \\"hammered\\" appearance, moderately to strongly viscid in wet weather, ranging in colour from ochraceous yellow to ochraceous brown, chestnut-brown, or in very old specimens blackish brown. The tubes are more or less free from the stem, long and pale yellow to ochraceous yellow. The pores are small and rounded, concolorous with the tubes, slowly staining rusty-brown and finally greyish brown when handled or with age. The stem is long by wide, usually stout and short-ventricose at first, but gradually becoming longer and clavate to cylindrical, ranging in colour from ochraceous yellow to pale yellow, straw- coloured, or dirty white. Its surface is covered in tiny pustules (scabrosities), concolorous with the stem surface at first, but often staining rusty-brown or grey-brown with age and sometimes coalescing to form an incomplete pseudoreticulum (false net). The flesh is thick and dull yellow to straw-coloured. When cut or exposed to the air it very slowly discoloures orange or violaceous-grey in parts, and after a few hours darkens to greyish- brown or grey-black. The smell is weakly fungoid in young specimens, becoming stronger in old specimens, while the taste is mild to somewhat astringent. The spores are tobacco-brown in mass. =Micromorphology= Under the microscope, the spores appear narrowly ellipsoid to fusiform (spinde-shaped) and measure 13.5‚Äì22 √ó 5‚Äì6 Œºm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium of septate cylindrical hyphae, often finely incrusted. =Mycorrhizae= The ectomycorrhizae formed by L. lepidum with the holm oak has been described in detail. It is characterised by a Hartig net devoid of haustoria, a plectenchymatous outer mantle of warty hyphae arranged in a ring-like formation, highly differentiated rhizomorphs which are rounded in cross-section and connected to the mantle, and a negative reaction to FeSO4, KOH or guaiac. =Similar species= *Leccinellum corsicum is closely related to L. lepidum, and the two taxa had been previously placed in synonymy by some authors. However, L. corsicum is a smaller species rarely exceeding in diameter, is exclusively associated with rockroses (Cistus species), and has the tendency to stain more reddish when its flesh is exposed to the air.Rolland L. (1896). Aliquot fungi novi vel critici Galliae praecipue meridionalis. Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Mycologique de France 12: 1‚Äì10. *Leccinellum crocipodium is also similar, but typically fruits earlier in the season in association with deciduous oaks. It produces more slender and elongated fruit bodies, with a cap cuticle that has the tendency to crack extensively at maturity. Ecology, phenology and distribution The species is widespread in the Mediterranean region, where it forms ectomycorrhizal associations with various species of oak. It is most commonly associated with evergreen members of the \\"Ilex\\" group, particularly the holm oak (Quercus ilex), but also the golden oak (Quercus alnifolia), the kermes oak (Q. coccifera) and the Palestine oak (Q. calliprinos). In the western parts of the Mediterranean basin, it is frequently found under the cork oak (Q. suber), while collections under the semi-deciduous Portuguese oak (Q. faginea) have also been reported.Ortega AC, Lorite J, Salazar C. (2010). Mycorrhizal macrofungi diversity (Agaricomycetes) from Mediterranean Quercus forests; a compilation for the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). Nova Hedwigia 91(1‚Äì2): 1 ‚Äì31. It is indifferent to the substrate and occurs abundantly on both calcareous and acidic soil. Although a southern species, the fungus is notable for its late fruiting season and tolerance to low temperatures. In a 10-year study from the island of Cyprus, L. lepidum was the most frequently recorded bolete, accounting for over half (61%) of all Boletaceae collections found during the winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary). Edibility Leccinellum lepidum is edible, though opinions on its culinary value vary. It is generally regarded gastronomically inferior to other popular boletes (such as Boletus edulis or B. aereus), while the tendency of its fruit bodies to stain black makes the mushroom unappealing to some people.

After the death of Yasutaro Koide, of Japan, on January 18, 2016, he was also recognized as the oldest living man in the world as well as one of the ten oldest men ever at his death at age 113 years and 330 days. Born in 1903 to religious parents in Maleniec, Ko≈Ñskie County, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, Kristal remained religiously observant all his life.\\"A devout Jew, he has wrapped phylacteries daily for the past century.\\" That's from Bar Mitzvah age until his passing. A confectioner by profession, he experienced World War I as an early teen, and World War II as an adult. After surviving the Holocaust, he emigrated to Israel. Early life Yisrael Kristal in Poland 1931, aged 28 Kristal was born to a religious Jewish family in Maleniec, Ko≈Ñskie County near ≈ªarn√≥w, then part of Congress Poland of the Russian Empire, on September 15, 1903. His father was a Torah scholar who ensured his son had a religious education, and Kristal would remain religiously observant all his life. He attended a cheder at age three, where he studied Judaism and Hebrew. He learned the Hebrew Bible at four and the Mishnah at six. In a 2012 interview, he recalled his father waking him at five in the morning to begin his religious instruction. His mother died in 1910 when he was seven years old. After World War I broke out in 1914, he saw Kaiser Franz Joseph in person when the monarch rode through his town in a car, and recalled them throwing sweets as he passed. His father was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, he was taken prisoner and died soon after the war. Meanwhile, Kristal moved in with his uncles. In 1920, at age 17, he moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫. After briefly laboring as a metalworker, he opened a candy store with an uncle. While initially working as a physical laborer, he later became a renowned expert candy-maker. He married Chaja Feige Frucht in 1928, and had two children. Holocaust survival In 1940, after the Germans had taken over Poland during World War II, Kristal continued to manufacture candy, at times secretly and at other times with the encouragement of the heads of the ghetto, among them head of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto Judenrat Chaim Rumkowski. His two children died in the ghetto, while Kristal and his wife were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp during the liquidation of the ghetto in August 1944. Kristal's wife was murdered in Auschwitz; he worked as a forced laborer and survived. When the camp was liberated by the Red Army, Kristal weighed . He was taken to the hospital, where he returned to his profession and made candies for Soviet soldiers, before returning to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he rebuilt his destroyed candy shop and met his second wife, Batsheva. They married in 1947. The couple had a son, Chaim, who was born in Poland, and a daughter, Shula, who was born in Israel. Life in Israel In 1950, the family immigrated to Israel on the ship Komemiyut and settled in Haifa. He initially worked at the Palata candy factory, where he was considered an expert and taught the owners to make an entire production line of sweets. He then became self-employed, making boutique sweets at home and selling them at a Haifa kiosk. Among the sweets he produced were tiny liquor bottles made of chocolate wrapped in colored foil, jam made from carob, and chocolate-covered orange peels. In 1952, he began manufacturing his candies at the Sar and Kristal Factory on Shivat Zion Street. After the factory closed in 1970, he returned to making his candies at home before retiring. Kristal had nine grandchildren. He also had great-grandchildren, but his family preferred not to state his exact number of descendants for fear of the \\"evil eye\\". Having been unable to do so at the age of 13 due to World War I, Kristal celebrated his bar mitzvah a century later, in September 2016, at the age of 113. Kristal died at his home in Haifa on August 11, 2017, just five weeks before his 114th birthday. Oldest living man Following the death of 110-year-old Alice Herz-Sommer in London on February 23, 2014, Kristal became recognized as the world's oldest known Holocaust survivor (though he was actually older than she was). He became the world's oldest living man on January 18, 2016, after the death of Japanese supercentenarian Yasutaro Koide. On March 11, 2016, Kristal was officially recognized as the world's oldest man by Guinness World Records. His status was verified after documents confirming his age were uncovered in Poland (formerly, the family's oldest document was from his wedding at age 25, but Guinness regulations require documentation from the first 20 years of a person's life to claim the record; the newly found documents were discovered by Jewish Records Indexing ‚Äì Poland).} See also *List of the oldest people by country *List of the verified oldest people NotesReferences External links  * Category:1903 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Confectioners Category:Auschwitz concentration camp survivors Category:Israeli chief executives Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli centenarians Category:Polish supercentenarians Category:Male supercentenarians Category:Metalworkers Category:People from Haifa Category:People from Ko≈Ñskie County Category:People from Radom Governorate Category:≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto inmates Category:Polish emigrants to Israel Category:Businesspeople from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Category:Imperial Russian Jews ","title":"Yisrael Kristal"},{"id":"49235580","text":"The Kenya national handball team is the national handball team of Kenya and is governed by the Kenya Handball Federation.

It is based on the true story of how American TV producer Milton Fruchtman and blacklisted TV director Leo Hurwitz came to broadcast the trial of one of World War II's most notorious Nazis, Adolf Eichmann in 1961.  Plot  In 1961 former Nazi Adolf Eichmann is captured by Israeli agents and put on trial. American television producer Milton Fruchtman fervently believes that the trial with its witness accounts of Nazi atrocities should be televised to show the world the evils of the Holocaust and to combat any resurgence of Nazism and joins forces with black-listed director Leo Hurwitz. Despite death threats, reluctance to cooperate from several networks and even resistance from the Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion, who fears a 'show trial', the pair persist and move their cameras into the courtroom. Edited daily and shown in some three dozen countries the 'Eichmann Show' becomes the first ever global television documentary. CastPostscript The film postscript reads: \\"After adjourning on the 14th August, the judges declared Eichmann responsible for the terrible conditions on board the trains to Auschwitz, and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. Eichmann was also found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. Adolf Eichmann was hanged on the 31st May 1962. His ashes were cast into the sea. The daily films produced and directed by Milton Fruchtman and Leo Hurwitz constitute the world's first ever global television documentary series. It was the first time the horror of the Nazi death camps had been heard on television, from the mouths of 112 eye witnesses and survivors. Following his work on the Eichmann trial, Milton Fruchtman won a Peabody Award and went on to have a successful career in American television. Leo Hurwitz continued to make documentary films.

In 1809, another altercation with the Blackfoot resulted in John Potts' death and Colter's capture. While going by canoe up the Jefferson River, Potts and Colter encountered several hundred Blackfoot who demanded they come ashore. Colter went ashore and was disarmed and stripped naked. When Potts then refused to come ashore he was shot and wounded. Potts in his turn shot one of the Indian warriors and died riddled with bullets fired by the Indians on the shore.

Amina Melendro de Pulecio The Conservatory of Tolima is one of the most important musical schools in Colombia. Its clearest predecessor was the School of Music for strings and piano founded by the Melendro and Sicard families, which led to the creation of the Colegio San Sim√≥n, but its beginnings were in the Academy of Music created by Ordinance No. 22 of 1889 and in the decree of Governor Jos√© I. Camacho who, on April 22, 1893, named maestro Tem√≠stocles Vargas as its principal. The Academy suspended operations upon the outbreak of the Thousand Days' War, and reappeared in 1906, around the Orchestra School directed by maestro Alberto Castilla. The historian H√©ctor Villegas, who for many years was both the principal and a teacher at the institution, attributes the belief that the Conservatory was founded in 1906 to oral tradition, but indicates that no document supports this. Instead he provides the documentation for the date mentioned earlier. Also, in the book \\"Itinerary of a Feat: History of the Tolima Music Conservatory\\" by Carlos Orlando Pardo Vi√±a, the earlier date is corroborated by the recording of the fact of the Academy of Music's suspension. From 1959 until 1998 the Conservatory of Tolima was led by Amina Melendro de Pulecio, who had previously been a piano teacher and vice principal of the school. She also founded the High School of Music, known today as the Conservatory of Ibagu√©. She was responsible for its conversion to a university of music in 1983. For several years the International Choir Contest was held, based in Ibagu√©, but attended by choirs from various countries of the Americas and Europe. In 1994 it was declared a National Monument and its Alberto Castilla Hall was named a masterwork of architecture and design. The Conservatory is currently housed in a Republican style building, with adobe masonry, rammed earth in some parts, wood floors, roofed in clay tile and with false ceilings. It was the seat of the Normal School and of a monastery run by the Community of the Marist Brothers.

Life Born in Oxfordshire about 1595, he was probably a member of the family of Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely and entered Oxford as a commoner of Christ Church in 1609, when he was about fourteen. Afterwards he became a member of Broadgates Hall, whence he took his degrees in arts, proceeding MA in 1617. He was ordained, and held a living at Sampford Peverell in Devon. According to Thomas Crosby in his History of the English General Baptists, he was strongly in favour of ceremonies in Archbishop William Laud's time, and was afterwards taunted by his presbyterian opponents for his zeal in this direction. Wood, however in his Athenae Oxonienses, says that he was always a puritan at heart, and it appears that in 1639 he was convened by Joseph Hall, Bishop of Exeter, for preaching that the Church of England did not hold episcopacy to be jure divino, but according to Thomas Brooks made \\"a handsome retractation\\". Although a puritan and an enemy to episcopacy, Cox in his earlier days may have upheld the sacramental system as warmly as many other presbyterians did. After the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he ventured to express opinions that he had thought it prudent to conceal up to that time. He later became a minister at Bedford, and openly preached the invalidity of infant baptism. In 1643 he was invited to form a congregation at Coventry. On his arrival Richard Baxter, who was then chaplain to the rebel forces in the town, challenged him to a controversy. Cox imprudently accepted the challenge of an opponent whose arguments were supported by the swords of an admiring congregation. After the discussion had been held, the presbyterians ordered him to quit the town, and when he refused or delayed to do so they imprisoned him. Baxter was afterwards reproached for having instigated this act of intolerance; and though he denied that he had done so, he can scarcely have opposed it. After his release Cox went to London, and preached to a congregation of baptists. A 1645 debate between supporters of the invalidity of infant baptism, Hanserd Knollys, William Kiffin and Cox on the one side with the Presbyterian divine Edmund Calamy on the other had to be cancelled when it was rumoured that the Baptists \\"planned to bring 'swords, clubs and staves' to ensure that their view prevailed.\\" He was one of the managers of a public dispute that was to be held at Aldermanbury on 3December 1645, and, when it was forbidden, joined in writing a declaration on the subject. He signed his name as Benjamin Cockes to the second edition of the Declaration of Faith of the Seven Congregations in London, published in 1647. He conformed in 1662, but afterwards renounced his living, and continued a baptist until his death at an advanced age.

The election was won by Awarua MP and incumbent deputy leader Joseph Ward.  Background  Richard Seddon had assumed the leadership on the death of John Ballance in 1893. As Ballance's deputy there was little opposition to this and Seddon claimed the leadership (and therefore premiership) initially on an interim basis. However, no formal leadership vote was held and Ballance's preferred successor, Robert Stout was never able to contest the leadership officially. Seddon proved to be a popular figure with the masses and continued to lead the Liberal's for a further 13 years until his death. Seddon died at sea and William Hall-Jones was acting Prime Minister in his absence at the time.  Candidates = Joseph Ward = Ward had been a Member of Parliament since 1887 and had been a part of the cabinets of both John Ballance and Richard Seddon. Most saw Ward as Seddon's natural heir. Of all the Liberal MPs, he was the most well known to the public a trait necessary for re-election. = William Hall-Jones = Hall-Jones had been left in an awkward position following Seddon's death. While Seddon was in Australia and Ward was in Britain, he was acting Prime Minister. In the confusion following Seddon's death, he informed the Governor General that he had formed a new ministry, near identical to Seddon's, and would only act as Premier until the Liberal caucus elected a new leader. This did nothing to stop speculation in the press that Hall-Jones might abstain from relinquishing power as Seddon had done before him. Ultimately he did not accept nomination for the leadership. Result As Ward was the only officially nominated candidate, Ward was elected unopposed as leader by the caucus. Hall-Jones continued as acting leader and Prime Minister until Ward returned to New Zealand.  Aftermath  Ward would remain the leader of the Liberal Party until he relinquished the role in 1912, following the disappointing result of the 1911 election.

One of the main functions of the base is to overhaul piston and jet engines in an engine shop as part of a complex system of operational and maintenance routines that underline the safe operation of each TCA aircraft. The TCA Canadair North Star airliner has its Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engines overhauled in Winnipeg on a regular schedule. Engine parts are tested, and depending on damage that is detected, may be repaired or replaced. An engine test bay is also available to ensure the engines are ready to go back onto the North Stars. With the TCA purchase of the British-built Vickers Viscount turboprop-powered airliner, the Winnipeg base is also in the midst of introducing jet engine technology for its engineering staff and technicians. TCA is the first North American carrier to use turboprop aircraft and air crews are also working up procedures to introduce the new airliner.

It premiered on FOX on April 13, 2015 and was written by Ken Woodruff, and directed by Eagle Egilsson. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) track down a serial killer known as \\"The Ogre\\". Meanwhile, Bruce (David Mazouz) and Selina (Camren Bicondova) continue to investigate Wayne Enterprises. The episode was watched by 4.50 million viewers and received mixed-to-positive reviews. Critics praised Milo Ventimiglia's performance and use of flashbacks but criticized Fish Mooney's storyline. Plot Gordon (Ben McKenzie) gets tasked by a young officer to investigate the murder of a girl, Grace Fairchild (Willa Fitzgerald). Along with Bullock (Donal Logue), they interrogate a bartender for information. Through flashbacks, a man, Jason Lennon (Milo Ventimiglia) seduces Fairchild in the bar and brings her to his house, but when she asks to leave, he kills her. Upon discovering a painting of a broken heart, Bullock states the murderer is a serial killer known as \\"The Ogre\\", who targets young women. He also reveals that whoever tries to catch him, the Ogre kills a loved one in revenge. While on the prison island, Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) develops an escape plan with the prisoners. Upon realizing only boats and helicopters are the way out, Mooney sends a group of thug prisoners to reach the boat. However, when they reach the boat, they realize Mooney betrayed them so the others could escape and are killed by the guards. Mooney and the rest of the prisoners escape in a helicopter, although Mooney receives a bullet in the rib. Bruce (David Mazouz) and Selina (Camren Bicondova) go after Reggie Payne (David O'Hara). They find him in an abandoned warehouse. When Selina threatens to throw his drugs through a window, Payne reveals that the Wayne Enterprises people who sent him to retrieve the files were Molly Mathis and Sid Bunderslaw. Although he tells them everything, Selina throws the drugs out the window. Payne states he will tell Bunderslaw that Bruce is after him. When he tries to retrieve the drugs, Bruce tries to push him through the window but is hesitant. Selina finally throws Payne through the window, killing him. Bullock interrogates the officer who sent Gordon to go after Fairchild's kidnapper. He finally reveals that Commissioner Loeb (Peter Scolari) sent him to give the case to Gordon.

The episode received a rating of 64% with an average score of 5.4 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"'Beasts of Prey' introduces an exciting new character arc with the Ogre, even if it strands Fish Mooney on an island of irrelevance.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.7 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham returned with a creepy, sick new villain (don't overcook his lamb!), an intriguingly ruthless Commissioner Loeb, and more of the usual Fish Mooney nonsense. The use of flashbacks helped this one a great deal (the first time they were used since \\"Sign of the Goat,\\" no?). In fact, if flashbacks can help fill up episodes and remove the need to overcrowd chapters with extraneous character check-ins, the show should consider using them more.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Even on its best days Gotham plays like a collection of footnotes and sidebars to the real Batman show most of us wish we were watching, and there's no clearer example of this than the continuing saga of Fish Mooney on Dollmaker Island. Here's a character with no canonical connection to the Bat-story who now has no connection whatsoever to anything else happening on the show; she's literally off on an island of her own. At least when Fish was in Gotham she had a role to play in the city's underworld power struggle, and by extension Oswald Cobblepot's transformation into the Penguin. Now she's an oddball tangent on a show that already suffers from excessive sprawl.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Beasts of Prey (Gotham)"},{"id":"49235990","text":"The Association Sportive Faa'a is a handball club in Papeete, Tahiti.

Schenck of Los Angeles and New York, briefly, before being sold John R. Brinkley, M.D. of Del Rio, Texas, and renamed Doctor Brinkley. In 1940, the US Navy purchased her and renamed her Jade, after the ornamental mineral jade; she is the only Navy ship to bear this name. Construction Athero II was designed by Henry J. Gielow, and built in 1926, by George Lawley & Son, Neponset, Massachusetts, as hull number 976 for Jesse Lauriston Livermore, of New York.

Athero II had a crew of twenty- five. On the berth deck forward were crew's quarters, including six staterooms aft of the bunk space with a galley and wardroom aft of the staterooms. An access stairway on the port side led to a lobby and to the central passageway for the crew spaces. Owners and guest spaces were aft of the machinery space with the owners stateroom and associated spaces, including bathroom, occupying the full width of the yacht. A centrally located door opened onto the passageway and lobby at the base of the starboard stairs giving access from the main deck. Two staterooms with connecting bath lay on each side of the central passage with another large stateroom and bath at the aft end of the passage.

The dining room occupied the forward portion. Aft of the dining room were quarters and pantry for the steward with a dumb waiter to the galley below. Aft of the steward's space was a living room. Above the deck house was the pilot house with further owner and guest spaces. In the machinery space were two Bessemer diesel engines, less compressors, weighing , started and reversed by compressed air from three single stage compressors. Electrical power was by a Bessemer Diesel engine driving a generator. Both the crew's and owner's spaces were ventilated by forced air circulation passing over hot water coils for heating or sea water coils for cooling. A Brunswick-Kroschell type refrigeration plant was installed for refrigeration and the production of ice. Yacht history By January 1928, the yacht had been sold to Eldridge R.

The film stars primarily Sa'ar Netanel, Boody, Samira Saraya, Ravit Geva, and Adam Russo, whose stories reflect the contemporary resistant attitude towards the LGBT community in Jerusalem. The film premiered on February 6, 2009 at the Berlin International Film Festival, and is now available on DVD. Synopsis The crew followed the participants in their daily lives documenting how they navigate the widespread opposition towards their sexual identity. = Sa'ar Netanel = Sa'ar is the first openly gay member of Jerusalem's City Council, whose political involvement revolves around promoting visibility for the LGBT community in Jerusalem, and creating a safe space for its members to freely express themselves. The latter was materialized when he opened the only gay bar in Jerusalem, named Shushan, where its patrons consider it being the only place that is free of judgment and discrimination towards their sexuality. However, being one of the few openly gay political advocates comes at the price that he has been repeatedly receiving death threats from disproving parties. His mother has also been receiving numerous hate calls in which the callers have equated her son to sub-animals, and accused him of blasphemy. After years of serving on the City Council with such persistent threat, Sa'ar eventually decided to resign from his political position. Shushan was also forced to be closed down due to funding issues, after four years of serving. = Boody = Boody is a young Palestinian man from Ramallah, who periodically climbs over the fence between Jerusalem and Palestine to go to Shushan where he performs as a drag queen. He is the oldest child in the family. As a result, growing up he had always felt the need to deny his own sexuality as a way to be an example for his younger siblings. Now that he is openly gay, his family knows what used to be his secret. However, his mom still hasn't come to terms with the fact that her son is gay. She believes that it is all in Boody's head, and hopes that he would still marry a woman one day. Mirroring Sa'ar's experience, Boody has been receiving death threats that made him fear of leaving his home. At the end of the film, he eventually moved to the United States where he met his fianc√©, Tarek. = Samira and Ravit = Samira and Ravit are a lesbian couple who have been together for four years. Samira is Palestinian Israeli, and Ravit is Jewish Israeli. They met working in the same hospital where Samira is a nurse, and Ravit is a doctor. Their relationship defies two prominent taboos that in their cultures, namely same-sex relationships and union between Arabs and Jews, which sometimes cause tension between the two lovers. However, despite public and familial opposition, they stay with each other and do what they can politically to bring voices to their much silenced community. = Adam Russo= Adam is a young Jewish man in love with Amit, an Arab from Palestine. The two met in Shushan, and now they are building a house together in a settlement along the fences that aim to ward off Jews from Palestinians where Adam grew up. During the 2005 Jerusalem gay pride parade, Adam was attacked with a knife three times by one of the protesters. Since then, he has become a spokesperson for the gay pride parade, joining others in making the much- resisted celebration of their sexuality happen every year. Production The writer, producer, and director of this film, Yun Suh, became interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict thanks to her own experiences back in her homeland South Korea. She claims that she identifies with both sides of the war because like Israelis, she was frightened throughout her childhood that North Korea would invade her village; and like Palestinians, she understands their anger as a result of the Japanese occupation. The concept of City of Borders first sprouted when Yun Suh visited Jerusalem doing a series of radio reports, where she learned about the existence of Shushan. But the production of the film did not take shape until 2006, when Suh visited Jerusalem again and contacted Sa'ar upon seeing his number being written on many walls in the city, accusing him of being the man responsible for earthquakes and plagues.

Ramm worked at CERN on the detection of neutrinos, developing the 500-litre bubble chamber known as the Ramm Chamber, which was completed in 1960. He later served as the Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Melbourne. The Ramm Prize for Experimental Physics, offered at the University of Melbourne, is named in his honour. Early life Colin Ramm was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1921. After he had completed his early studies at Guildford Grammar School, he obtained an exhibition to the University of Melbourne, but he was unable to accept it. Instead, he decided to join the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau, there he started to study part-time with a free place at the University of Western Australia. His passion had been chemistry, but later he concentrated on physics, and in 1942 he gained a first-class Honours degree. But during the war the Meteorological Bureau became part of the Royal Australian Air Force, because of this he was seconded to the University for optical munitions work. He was skilful at experimental techniques but instead he had to spend much time in the final polishing of lens plates. After the war he became interested in cosmic rays, klystrons and teaching, so he stayed at the university. In the year 1947 he got an invitation from. M.L.E (now Sir Marcus) Oliphant to be a lecturer at Birmingham University, where Europe's first proton synchrotron, it could give an energy of 1 GeV was being built. CERN At about this time there was plans for the 28-GeV CERN proton synchroton, Colin Ramm was very interested in the idea of an internationale collaboration to build a much faster accelerator. So he joined the PS Division in 1954 as the leader of the magnet group, which became responsible for the whole of the synchroton's magnet system. When the work on the magnet finished the magnet group became the Nuclear Physics Apparatus Division in 1961. At this time they turned towards making the PS usable as an experimental device, and in the course of time a number of projects took shape: the heavy-liquid bubble chamber, enhanced neutrino beam, electrostatic separators. The bubble chamber has a volume of 500 litres, is still now to this day the largest heavy liquid chamber operating in a magnetic field at its time. Completed in 1960 it was used in CERN's first neutrino experiments. The electrostatic separators built by Colin‚Äôs division gave CERN some of the world‚Äôs highest-energy beams of separated particles, as well as leading to research into the basic principles of high-voltage breakdown. End life Colin went back to Australia in 1972 where he was invited to become the first full-time Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Melbourne. After his retirement in 1983 he joined the School of Physics. And after nearly 30 years he returned to teaching. He retired in 1988, and died in 2014 at the Bupa Aged Care Caulfield Australia.

It is a shrub with broad, shiny, sticky leaves and yellowish-green flowers and which often forms dense thickets. Description Eremophila gibbosa is a shrub growing to between tall with many shiny, erect branches. It has the ability to sucker, sometimes forming dense thickets. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are elliptic to egg-shaped, mostly long, wide with a stalk long. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a sticky, S-shaped stalk long. There are 5 overlapping green or purple sepals which are mostly long and glabrous except for a dense tuft of matted white hairs near their ends. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is yellowish-green and covered with glandular hairs on both the inside and outside. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs from May to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody and almost spherical with a pointed tip and are in diameter.Norseman Taxonomy and naming Eremophila gibbosa was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1979 and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (gibbosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"humpbacked\\", \\"humped\\", \\"crooked\\" or \\"bent\\" referring to the shape of the fruits of this species. Distribution and habitat This eremophila often grows on clay loam in disturbed areas such as those affected by fire. It occurs between Balladonia and Lake Johnston in the Coolgardie biogeographic region. Conservation status Humped fuchsia bush is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The unusual foliage of this eremophila is an attractive feature as are the small blue to purple flowers. It is suitable for a small garden or as a container plant. It can be propagated from cuttings but may perform better if grafted onto Myoporum rootstock. The grafted form will grow in most soils. The shrub is tolerant of drought and frost but benefits from an occasional watering during dry periods.

Mobs stormed the embassy in Tehran and the Saudi consulate in Mashhad and ransacked them. The embassy building was set on fire with Molotov cocktails and petrol bombs. During the attacks, the police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire. The attacks were later condemned by Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. On 24 January, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i announced that around 100 people involved in the attack are in custody by the authorities. Background Moments after Sheikh Nimr was executed, the Saudi Arabian charg√© d'affaires was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to protest against the execution. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari said the execution of Sheikh Nimr \\"who had no means other than speech to pursue his political and religious objectives only shows the depth of imprudence and irresponsibility\\". He said that the Saudi government \\"supports terrorist movements and Takfiri extremists, while executing and suppressing critics inside the country\\". The remarks were later condemned by Saudi Arabia as \\"hostile\\" and the ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador in Riyadh. The ministry expressed \\"the kingdom's astonishment and its utter rejection of these hostile statements, which it deemed a blatant intervention in the kingdom's affairs\\", according to a statement released by the Saudi Press Agency. Incursion About several thousand demonstrators gathered near the embassy on Saturday night to protest and strongly condemn the execution of Sheikh Nimr. The rally began quietly, but some participants attempted to storm the building by climbing the embassy's fence, breaking down the door, throwing around papers on the roof and seizing the Saudi flag. The protesters chanted, \\"Death to the Al Saud [family]\\", the ruling family of Saudi Arabia among other slogans. It later turned violent after demonstrators began throwing petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at the embassy and then broke into the compound. The police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire. In Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, demonstrators also set fire at the Saudi consulate and torn down the Saudi flag. Reactions=Iran= Protest in Mashhad in front of Saudi consulate (3 January 2016) Protest in Tehran in front of Saudi embassy (3 January 2016) Saudi embassy, three months before attacks (4 October 2015) Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei condemned the attacks and known it as \\"a very bad and wrong incident\\". Also, he declared that: \\"like the British embassy attack before it, this was against the country (Iran) and Islam, and I didn't like it.\\" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani condemned the attacks while at the same time he also condemned the execution of Nimr al-Nimr. He blamed the attacks on \\"extremist individuals\\". He has pledged to protect the security of foreign missions and prosecute those responsible for attacking Saudi diplomatic posts, in a series of messages posted on his Twitter account moments after the attack. On 6 January, President Rouhani has asked the Iranian judiciary to immediately prosecute the attackers invoked. He said by punishing the attackers and those who orchestrated this obvious offense, his government should put an end once and forever to such damage and insults to Iran's dignity and national security.\\" The Iranian authorities have express regret over the attacks and arrested at least 40 individuals in connection to the attack. Five days later on January 7, 2016, Iran's foreign ministry made the claim that Saudi warplanes had \\"deliberately\\" targeted its embassy to Yemen in the city of Sana'a. Iran's report included claims that,\\"a number of the building's guards\\" had been injured as a result of the bombing. Despite this assertion San'aa residents and the Associated Press have reported that the embassy suffered no visible damage. Currently General Ahmad Asseri from the Saudi-led coalition is investigating Iran's allegations. On 24 January, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i announced on state TV that they arrested around 100 people involved in the attack. Some of them were later released. As of the end of July, 2017, five of those tried were sentenced to six months in prison, while five others were handed down three-month sentences. =Saudi Arabia= Following the attack, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir announced that they will break off diplomatic relations with Iran, recalling its diplomats from Tehran and declared Iranian diplomats in Riyadh personae non grata, ordering to leave the kingdom within 48 hours. A day later (on 4 January), Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that they will end air traffic and trade links with Iran and also cutting off all commercial relations with Iran.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Ohio-a diesel yacht built in 1922 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company-was laid down on 1 August 1922; launched on 16 September 1922; and delivered exactly two months later to Edward Willis Scripps, the publisher of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers. After Scripps died on board the yacht on 12 March 1926, as she lay anchored in Monrovia Bay, Liberia, the yacht served a succession of owners under the names Maramichi, Walucia III, Kallisto, and Entropy. On 21 August 1940, as America girded for World War II, the United States Navy purchased Entropy from Robert V. G. Furman of Schenectady, New York, classified her a submarine chaser, and designated her PC-459. Since American submarine chasers were unnamed during World War II, the ship was known simply by her hull number, PC-459. The luxury craft entered the Gibbs-Jacksonville Yard at Jacksonville, Florida, on 25 September 1940 for conversion for naval use. On 5 December 1940, PC-459 was placed in commission at Jacksonville, Lt. Comdr. Cecil G. McKinney, USNR, in command. Service history Following commissioning, PC-459 put into Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, on 9 December for fitting out. After spending the remainder of December 1940 and the better part of January 1941 in training exercises and shakedown, she got underway for Cuban waters in company with on 21 January. After a brief stay at Guantanamo Bay, PC-459 set out on 30 January for Puerto Rico. Upon arrival at San Juan, Puerto Rico on 1 February 1941, PC-459 was reclassified a patrol yacht, designated PY-18, and named Turquoise. Operating under the Commandant of the 10th Naval District, Turquoise patrolled Caribbean waters through July as the Battle of the Atlantic moved ever closer to neutral waters on the American coast. On 1 August, when the Navy commissioned the Naval Operating Base at Trinidad, British West Indies, the patrol yacht received orders to report there for duty as temporary station ship. She remained in the vicinity of Trinidad until early December, when she returned to Charleston for refit. On 7 December, the day after she entered the navy yard, the Empire of Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Four days later, on 11 December, Italy and Germany declared war on the United States. Her refit shortened, Turquoise steamed back to Puerto Rico and arrived on 20 December. She operated in the Caribbean on local patrols into the early spring, when she returned to Charleston for availability. Upon the conclusion of the overhaul, she set out for San Juan on 9 April 1942. Upon arrival, she received orders to escort a YP and a dredge to Trinidad and then to report to the Commandant of the Naval Operating Base there for orders. Besides inshore patrol duties out of Trinidad, she also escorted local convoys in the Caribbean area, called at such ports as Gonaives and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, besides the already- frequented San Juan, Trinidad, Key West, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay. But for occasional refits at Charleston, she continued such operations through most of 1943. In December 1943, she received orders to proceed to the Canal Zone. Transfer to the Ecuadorian Navy Arriving on 24 December 1943, she was transferred under lend-lease to the Ecuadorian Navy on 29 January 1944. The yacht operated under the Ecuadorian flag as Nueve de Octobre (9 October) through 1949. She was sold to the Ecuadorian government on 13 May 1949 and was struck from the Navy list on 7 June 1949. Renamed Esmeraldas, after a port city in Ecuador, she served with the Ecuadorian Navy into 1953. Esmeraldas ran aground in the Guayas River, near Guayaquil, and was declared a total loss on 9 September 1953. Turquoise did not receive any battle stars for her World War II service.

The silk is known for its extreme durability and has a natural yellowish-golden tint with a shimmering, glossy texture. It was previously reserved for the use of royalty. In the Brahmaputra Valley, the larvae of the Assam silkmoth feed on aromatic Som (Machilus bombycina) and Sualu (Litsea polyantha) leaves. Muga silk can be dyed after bleaching. This silk can be hand-washed with its lustre increasing after every wash. Muga silk, like other Assam silks, is used in products like saris, mekhalas and chadors.  History  Sericulture in Assam is an ancient industry without a precise time of origin. Assam was well known for the production of high quality silk since ancient times. The craft of weaving goes along with the production of silk. It grew to such sophistication in Assam that it was known all over India and abroad. The first reference to Assam silk was probably in Valmiki's Ramayana. In the Kishkindha Kanda of Ramayana, it is stated that one travelling towards the east has to first pass through Magadha, Anga, Pundra and then the Kosha- karanam-bhumi (\\"the country of cocoon rearers\\").Sharma,S.K.,Discovery of North-East India, p.315.Deka, Phani. The Great Indian Corridor in the East, p.63.M, Mignonette. Society and Economy in North-east India, Volume 2\\", 2004, p.316. Kautilya‚Äôs Arthashastra, a political literature of the 3rd century BC, makes references to the highly sophisticated silk clothing from Assam. Kautilya mentions the production of Suvarnakudyaka (from Kamrupa) along with Vangika(from Vanga/southern Bengal) and Paundrika(from Pundra/northern Bengal), all of which were types of Kauseya(Tussar/Muga) and Cina- patta(Mulberry silk). The fact that Kamrupa produced Suvarnakudyaka is confirmed by the 8th century writer KumƒÅrila Bha·π≠·π≠a who, in his commentary of Arthashatra, said that the Muga silk was a product of Kamrupa(Kamarupeschaiva Suvarna Kudyah).Dhavalikar, M.K., Archeology of Guwahati, 1972, p.139 As per the Arthashatra, the fibres of Suvarnakudyaka were of 'the colour of butter', 'as red as the sun', and of the best quality.Kautilya,Arthashatra,p.110 Due to this description of colour, the type of silk can be easily identified as Muga. The Arthashatra also refers to four trees (Vakula, Likucha, Vata and Naga- vriksa) which the silkworms feed on. Out of this, Vakula and Naga-vriksa belong to the genus Ericales and Magnolia which the Muga silkworm Antheraea assamensis is known to feed on; while Likucha and Vata belong to the genus Moraceae(Mulberry) which the Pat Silkworm feeds on. The text also states that the fibre was spun while the threads were wet, indicating that the production method was still the same at that period.Kautilya,Arthashatra,p.109,\\"and that which is the product of the country, Suvarnakudya, is as red as the sun, as soft as the surface of the gem, woven while the threads are very wet, and of uniform (chaturasra) or mixed texture (vy√°misrav√°na).\\" The knowledge of sericulture probably arrived with the Tibeto-Burman groups which arrived from China around the period of 3000-2000 BC. Moreover, there was another trade of Silk through the Southwestern Silk road which started from China, passed through Burma and Assam, finally getting connected to the main silk road in Turkministan. There are various other records to show that Silk came to India through Assam. As per the Sanskrit text Harshacharita (biography of North Indian ruler Harshavardhan written by the court poet Banabhatta in the 7th century), during the coronation ceremony of King Harshavardhan, king Bhaskarvarman of Kamrupa gifted many precious items to the North Indian king. Out of this the most important ones include the silk items and other precious jewels. These included a white silk umbrella, sacks of woven silk and silken towels.\\"Kirata-jana-kriti\\", S.K. Chatterjee, 1951, p. 95-96. It is also mentioned in the text that the silk fibres were so even and polished that it resembled Bhoj-patra(golden in colour).Suhas Chatterjee, Indian Civilisation and Culture, p. 435There are also references of Assam silk in the records written by Huen Sang where he has written the use and trade of silk in Kamrupa during the rule of king Bhaskar Varman. Ram Mohan Nath in his book \\"The Background of Assamese culture states that: \\"The Kiratas,(an early Mongoloid race in Assam, were traders in silk, a word that was derived from the Mongolian original word ‚Äòsirkek‚Äô. The Indian word ‚Äòsari‚Äô is probably derived from the same word. ‚ÄúIt is therefore clear that in ancient times traders from different parts of Tibet, Central Asia and China flocked to Assam through various routes, and as they traded mostly in silk, they were generally called Seres ‚Äì Cirrahadoi ‚Äì Syrities ‚Äì Cirata-Kirata. The word Kirata therefore, is a general term referring to the people of the Mongolian origin and it refers specially to the Bodos.‚Äù These Bodos referred by Nath are today known as Bodo- Kacharis which includes groups such as Chutias, Boros, Dimasas, Rabhas, Sonowal, Garo, Koch and many more. J.Geoghegan in his book \\"Silk in India\\" states that: \\"It is the Kiratas who introduced the cultivation of silk with its different varieties in Assam and it is from Assam that Silk was later introduced to mainland India. Whatever may be the date of the introduction of the worm, its geographical distribution at present day, and the fact species first introduced was a multivoltine, seem to me to lead to the conclusion that the insect was first introduced into India from the north-east (i.e. Assam)\\". Genetic research on silkworms show that Assam silk originated in two specific regions of Assam. One was Garo Hills in the ancient Kamrupa kingdom and the other was Dhakuakhana in the ancient Chutiya kingdom. As per the Naoboicha Phukanar Buranji, Muga was adopted in the Ahom courts at later period. As per the text, one of the Ahom kings upon the advise of his ministers took the decision of introducing Muga, Paat clothing and employed a thousand Muga producers and weavers from the Chutia community to weave royal garments in the capital. Padmeswar Naoboicha Phukan, Assam Buranji, p.30 Before that the Ahoms are said to have worn black-coloured clothes. In the Assam Buranji, the Ahoms are mentioned as \\"Lunda-Munda Kula Kapur pindha luk\\"(black-clothed men) in the 16th century[Mahanta,S. Assam Buranji.D.H.A.S.,1945, p.70.], which denotes they wore black cotton clothes till the 16th century similar to the other Tais of Yunnan and Burma. Due to this adoption of the clothing style of native rulers, Muga production received patronage from the Ahom dynasty in the later period of their rule. Royalty and senior mandarins were prescribed clothing made of the silk. Ahom kings were known to keep many costly muga sets in the royal storehouse for presentation to distinguished visitors to their court. Queens were personally involved in training weavers. The fabric was also a chief export of the Ahoms. Although Silk was cultivated and woven by women all around Assam, the silk clothes of a particular place named Sualkuchi achieved much fame during the Kamarupa as well as Ahom rule. Sualkuchi is said to have been established in the 11th Century by King Dharma Pala of the Pala dynasty that ruled western Assam from 900 AD to about 1100 AD. Dharmapala, the story goes, brought 26 weaver families from Tantikuchi in Barpeta to Sualkuchi and created a weavers' village close to modern-day Guwahati.Trouble looms Silk was given royal patronage during that period and Sualkuchi was made an important centre of Silk weaving. The Hand-loom industry of Sualkuchi encompasses cotton textile, silk textile as well as Khadi cloth which are, in fact, traditional cloth endowing high social and moral value in and outside the state. However, Sualkuchi is well known for silk textiles both mulberry and muga silk. In fact muga, \\"the golden fibre\\" is produced only in Assam and it has also tremendous export potentiality. Such activities are intimately linked with the culture and tradition of the Assamese people since long past. Muga silk was recognized as a protected geographical indication (GI) in 2007, and was granted a GI logo for trademark purposes in 2014. The logo has been registered with the Assam Science Technology and Environment Council. The Central Silk Board of India has been granted the authority to inspect muga silk products, certify their authenticity and allow producers to use the GI logo. This board is also involved in R&D; and infrastructure development for Assamese silk, including muga, through the Central Muga Eri Research & Training Institute (CMER&TI;) in Jorhat, Assam. In 2015, Adarsh Gupta K of Nagaraju's research team at Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India, discovered the complete sequence and the protein structure of muga silk fibroin and published it in Nature Scientific Reports. India produced 158 tonnes of muga silk in FY 2014‚Äì15, out of which 136 tonnes were produced in Assam. India's total silk output in the same period amounted to 28,708 tonnes.

The cool climate and red soil of the region make it suitable for growing the fruit and give it a unique taste. Mahabaleshwar strawberries being sold The Mahabaleshwar strawberry is a seasonal fruit with the usual season lasting between October‚ÄìNovember and April‚ÄìMay. Mother saplings, some of which are imported from California in the month of June, are planted in nurseries in places like Wai. The runners produced by each of these saplings are replanted in the month of September. The land is prepared after the monsoon season in September by fumigation and covering the fields with plastic sheets. The seeds are planted in holes punched through these sheets and cow dung manure and sprays are added to the fields. Nearly half of the fruit in the region belongs to the Sweet Charlie variety of California, with Camarosa and Winter Dawn being the other two major varieties. Other notable varieties include Rania and Nabila. Mahabaleshwar strawberry is used in making various food products in the region such as preserves, jams, fruit crushes, ice-creams, milkshakes, strawberry with fresh cream, strawberry fudge, strawberry wine and jelly toffees. Export Strawberries from Mahabaleshwar are exported in large quantities to other countries like France, Belgium, Malaysia, and to the Middle East. The fruit is frozen before it is exported. Geographical Indication The All India Strawberry Grower's Association proposed the registration of Mahabaleshwar strawberry under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act, 1999, to the Office of the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Chennai. The fruit was granted the GI status two years later in 2010.

It is made in Sankheda village and hence its name. The village is located about from Vadodara. In recent years, colour innovation has been adopted with black, blue, green, ivory, copper, silver and burgundy shades. The product is not only widely marketed in India but is exported to many countries including Europe and West Asia. Now with the adoption of chemical pigments, instead of the traditional organic dyes and pulp of kewda leaves (fragrant screw pine) as a colouring base, the palette has many colours to offer for painting the furniture. However, the \\"tinfoil patterns with transparent lacquer coating\\" is the basic traditional method which is continued, with polishing done with agate. The product is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks on 5 July 2007 under the title \\"Sankheda Furniture\\" and listed at GI Application number 100 under Class 20 on 5 July 2007 as a handicraft item. History Sankheda furniture corner table According to historical records this type of furniture was reported in the 17th century by George Rocques, a French writer and James Forbes, a British civil servant. At that time teak wood used to make this furniture was transported from Valsad and painted with indigenous colours. The product was then exported from Surat and Khambhat ports. A local legend narrated to the origin of this craft form is that a spiritually oriented person, to avoid Mughal invaders, came to Sankheda and stayed in a hut with a wood cutter who looked after him. After staying with him for a long period he suddenly disappeared. However, the night he vanished from the village, the wood cutter saw him in his dream and the sagely person blessed him with skills of craftsmanship in carpentry. The wood cutter then became a carpenter and started carving furniture using lacquer coating. To promote this craftsmanship, a training institute has been established in Ahmedabad. Products Apart from traditional furniture in a wide range of three piece settees, headboards, beds, garden swings, dressing tables, rocking chairs, tables, screens, divan, etc., other handicraft innovations introduced in this format are wall-hangings, pedestal lamps, flower vases and pen stands, toys, kitchen ware and support for hammocks. Though the design appears fragile, the furniture is durable and lasts for a long period. It is a custom among the Gujarati community to gift this traditional furniture as an auspicious gift during marriage.

Sometime at the end of 1580s he taught at the Lviv Brotherhood School, after which in 1592 Stavrovetsky moved to Ostrog and Wilno due to persecutions against bishop Hedeon Balaban. In December 1592 along with Ternopil brethren, he vouched for the Lviv Brotherhood in front of Jeremias II of Constantinople. The fact is reflected in inscription over the entrance of the Ternopil Nativity Church. In 1618 Stavrovetsky returned to Pochaiv and for a brief time was hegumen at the small Univ Dormition Monastery (1618). Later he was a hegumen (1618-19) at the Lubartow Monastery near Lublin.

The French language class features with art courses. History The badge of Trinity College Foochow (Fuzhou). The red brick mansion of Trinity College Foochow (Fuzhou). Its precursor is St. Mark's College founded in 1907 by W. S. Pakenham-Walsh, a Chaplain of Dublin University Far Eastern Mission. There were only ten students in the first year, and all staff was W. S. Pakenham-Walsh and his wife plus a Chinese teacher. In the beginning, the college was funded by an Irish lady who was familiar W. S. Pakenham-Walsh's father, totally ¬£40. In 1909, there are 150 people applied to the school, taking 100 people. In 1911, after getting a large amount of donation from Pan-Anglican Congress, Church Mission Society decided to merge the college with a middle school and a primary school. W. S. Pakenham-Walsh purchased Russian consulate and surrounding land as the campus of the new school, and named it Trinity College Foochow (Fuzhou).The name indicated its strong relationship with Trinity College Dublin and Christianity. St. Mark's College became the Anglo-Chinese school of Trinity College, where most courses were taught in English and another combined middle school mainly in Chinese language. The school maintained a high English standard, as a result, its students were very popular with society, many of them even began working without graduation. Dublin University Fukien Mission was in charge of the management of the school, hence many teachers and staffers were missionaries who came from Ireland. The students had to study the Bible and participate the religious activities including morning prayer, evening prayer. Graduates of Anglo-Chinese school could enter Saint John's University, Shanghai and Fukien Christian University founded in 1916 without exam. The school applied to Chinese education department for register in 1927, as the school was independence to the Chinese government before. Except for English, the language of courses in Anglo-Chinese school changed to Chinese language. On 2 January 1928, the education department approve the application. After registration, the teaching and administration of the school were transferred to Chinese staff, but still financed by Church Mission Society. In 1928, due to growing public pressure on taking the right of education back and against the \\"cultural invasion\\", Rev.W.P.W.Williams resigned from the post of headmaster, who was the last foreigner in this position. In summer 1929, Rev.W.P.W.Williams ordered the Chinese headmaster to fire two students, which caused large scale protest among students, and they succeed at last. In 1930, Anglo-Chinese school merged with the high school of Trinity College. After Second Sino-Japanese war broke out, the school first moved to Gutian, and in 1939 moved to Chong'an (now Wuyishan) in North Fujian. In 1941, it was merged with Do-seuk Girls' School from Fuzhou after the city fell. On 15 April 1941, the Japanese aircraft bombed the school, killing 6 students. In summer 1942, the senior high school moved back to Gutian, and the junior high school moved to Minhou near Fuzhou. In 1945, all departments moved back to Fuzhou. In October 1952, after the Communist Party came to power, it was taken over by the authorities and renamed Fuzhou No. 9 Middle School. In July 1993, the school began using this name, although most townspeople still refer the school as \\"Jiuzhong\\" (the abbreviation of No. 9 middle school in Chinese). =Trinity College Foochow Badge= The Dublin University Far Eastern Mission (founded in 1886) established Trinity College Fuzhou in 1907, now the Fuzhou Foreign Language School.

The Royal Swedish Aero Club has a wholly owned service company, located at Bromma Airport, which sells aeronautical maps and other aviation accessories. History When the Swedish Aeronautical Society (Svenska Aeronautiska S√§llskapet, SAS) was established in Stockholm on 15 December 1900, there were only one predecessor in the world, the A√©ro-Club de France. The purpose of the society was \\"to its ability encourage the art of ballooning in Sweden in all its branches\\", and the first years until about 1910 was mostly about aerostats (balloons) and was later transformed into aerodynes (aircraft). At the Society's initiatives a large number of balloon flights were conducted during the first decade of 1900s. During the early years, a time record were set by Karl Amundson in 1903 at 26 hours from Stockholm, Sweden to Randers, Denmark and a length record was set by Erik Unge in 1902 when he flew 730 km from Stockholm to Lake Ilmen, Russia; both with the balloon Svenske (Swede). The observation results from some of the society's expeditions were compiled by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in its documents and were published in German. After 1910 the society's interest was dedicated almost entirely to aircraft rather than on balloons. 1910-1912 \\"fly weeks\\" were organized in Stockholm, competitions and air shows around the country, where especially Baron Carl Cederstr√∂m's (\\"The Flying Baron\\") shows attracted great interest. Through the society's activities the first ever aircraft in Sweden was built, and this was donated to the state. In the spring of 1915 an exposition in Stockholm was organized, which highlighted the domestic aircraft manufacturing's position and wishes for its future development. World War I meant greatly increased interest for military aviation, but the society also worked during this era to establish civilian aviation operations. Among other things, the society worked to bring about airports at various locations in Sweden and thus create conditions for scheduled air services. Oscar II of Sweden was the society's guardian and in December 1910 the Crown Prince of Sweden succeeded him. In connection with the 20th anniversary in 1920 the name was changed to the current Kungliga Svenska Aeroklubben (KSAK).

The film commemorates Singapore's 50th birthday and stars Aileen Tan, Mark Lee and Wang Lei as the main casts. Plot The story spans from 1965 to the early 1970s. Heavily pregnant Zhao Di, the unwanted second wife of an older man, was chased out by her husband's family and forced to return to her own family. She eventually gave birth to twins, Shun Fatt and Su-Fang. As Su-Fang had two moles on her face, which was said to be bad luck, Zhao Di decided to give her up due to the pressure of wanting to build a better life for the rest of her family. With Zhao Di's indomitable spirit, and with the help of her family, they went through adversities, witnessed the changes through the years, and accompanied every step of the nation's growth in its early years.

Due to an accident, she chipped her tooth, but Neo forbade her to fix the chipped upper lateral incisor because he said it gave her character a stronger personality. Meanwhile, Wang Lei had to wear prosthetic teeth and facial hair, and dye his hair white to play the role of a 60 to 70-year-old. =Filming= The film was inspired by Neo's own childhood of growing up in Kampong Chai Chee, and some scenes were filmed in Ipoh, Malaysia, especially in Kampung Cina Pusing. Filming started in May 2015, with both parts shot over 60 days. The film's budget was initially $5 million, but because Neo \\"wanted to make improvements\\", he \\"took a cut from my director's fee to make things happen\\", as a result, it went up to $6 million. A huge amount of resources was involved in the making, such as the construction of a 30m-by-30m pool that is 1.5m deep to film scenes recreating the 1969 Singapore flood. It also introduced Auro-3D for clearer sounds. =Music= The theme song for the film, \\"Our Memories\\" (Êàë‰ª¨ÁöÑÂõûÂøÜ), is composed by Matthew Tang with lyrics by Jack Neo and Ivan Ho, and is sung by Getai singers Desmond Ng, Leon Lim, Febe Huang and Sherraine Law. Reception=Critical reception= Critical reception was mostly positive. The New Paper gave it a 4/5 rating, calling it a \\"tender, fitting paean to our hardworking pioneer generation\\" and finding that compared to his previous movies, \\"there is no over-sentimentality in this one\\". inSing also gave it 4/5, praising how the performances of the film's veteran actors, Aileen Tan and Mark Lee, \\"keep the viewer engrossed, as well as help to lift the heavily plotted and sometimes meandering film\\". F*** magazine gave the film 3.5/5, surprised to find \\"a solid, well-assembled film in its own right, with a swashbuckling cast at the top of its game that shows up the Ah Boys...for the acting lightweights that they are\\". SINdie noted how although \\"the inevitable family melodrama in Neo‚Äôs films may be [sic] tedious, but that doesn‚Äôt dissipate the warmth that drives this project... there is the sense that the people behind Long Long Time Ago are more than collaborators, but rather a collaborative community akin to a family\\". Whang Yee-Ling of 8 Days awarded it 3.5/5, praising the \\"strongly played\\" performances of Aileen Tan, Mark Lee and Wang Lei and calling the film \\"equal parts heartfelt and calculating in manipulating our lump-in-the-throat nostalgia. It's a winner, the Hokkien dialect especially a treat\\". =Box office= Long Long Time Ago topped the Chinese New Year box office in Singapore, grossing $1.65 million in six days, beating films like The Monkey King 2 and The Mermaid. At the end of the film's run in late March 2016, the film has earned $4.15 million at the Singapore box office.

Career From 1931 to 1936 Barcos played for Baracaldo F.C. In the summer of 1936, just as he was about to sign for Athletic Bilbao, the Spanish Civil War began and all national leagues in Spain were suspended. At the beginning of 1937, a Basque Country national football team was selected to travel abroad to raise money to help refugees fleeing the civil war. Barcos was a member of this team which toured Europe and the Americas. While on that tour he was once chosen to play an entire match as goalkeeper because the team goalkeeper was injured and they had no substitute. The match was against the Mexico national team and ended with a 6-2 victory to the Basques. During the 1938/39 season he played for Club Deportivo Euzkadi in the Primera Fuerza league in Mexico.

His parents were German and he was brought up as a Lutheran even though his father was Jewish. They sent Peter to London at the age of 16 and he studied civil engineering at Imperial College. When WWII began, he was assigned to the Ministry of Works to supervise the building of brigade camps that would be used for soldier training.  Early career  After WWII, he joined Rendel Palmer and Tritton and specialized in heavy marine engineering projects. He worked on the creation of the Port Talbot harbor in South Wales and was awarded the Telford medal after presenting this project at the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1975, Fraenkel put together the Fraenkel report about the UK's 3100 km of canals and whether they could be brought back for commercial use. He argued that there was a case for restoring much of these canals with the government's funding. After this report was submitted to the Department of the Environment, many projects were accomplished such as the restoration of 39 locks on the Kennet and Avon canal and the restoration of the Avoncliff aqueduct.  Consultancy  Fraenkel set up his own consultancy in 1972. He won projects all over the world and received the Queen's award for enterprise in 1982.  Death  Fraenkel died at the age of 94 on 18 November 2009. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, of 62 years and his two daughters, Laura and Sarah.

As a result of this marriage, Temple gained four step children including Sir Thomas Penistone Temple was knighted at the Tower of London by James I following the King's accession to the English throne - one of many members of the gentry who were knighted during the first years of the King's reign. Following the death of his first wife, Sir Alexander moved to Chadwell St Mary in Essex. In the early 1620s, he married Mary Bankworth (who was previously married to John Busbridge), and moved to Haremere Hall in Etchingham, Sussex.

The halo extends far outside a galaxy's brightest regions and typically contains its oldest and most metal poor stars. Observation history Early studies, investigating the shape of the stellar halo of the Milky Way, found some evidence that it may vary with increasing distance from the galaxy. These studies found halos with spherically shaped outer regions and flatter inner regions. Large surveys in the 21st century such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have allowed the shape and distribution of the stellar halo to be investigated in much more detail; this data has been used to postulate a triaxial or oblate halo. More recent studies have found the halo to be flattened with a broken power law radius dependence; evidence for triaxiality is unclear. As a result of their faint brightness, observations of stellar halos in distant galaxies have required very long exposure times, the stacking of data from numerous galaxies to obtain averaged properties, or observing only the resolved stellar populations. Individual resolved stars in stellar halos can only be measured in the Milky Way and Andromeda. The furthest stellar halos detected are at a redshift distance of 1. Structure/properties In the Lambda-CDM model of the universe, galaxies grow by mergers. Such mergers are the cause of substructure observed in the stellar halo of galaxies; streams of stars from disrupted satellite galaxies are detectable through their coherence in space or velocity; a number of these streams are observable around the Milky Way. As a result of the buildup from an assortment of satellite galaxies, variations in properties such as metallicity are present across stellar populations in halos. Astrophysical simulations of galaxies have predicted that stellar halos should have two components; one inner region dominated by stars which formed within the galaxy, and an outer region primarily composed of stars accreted through merger events. Predictions for these components include different structure and rotation directions. Observational evidence for this dual halo in the Milky Way has been claimed but contested. Milky Way Studies of the Milky Way galaxy have found that approximately 0.1-1% of its total stellar mass is contained within the stellar halo, and that it extends to over 100 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre.

It was founded in 2015 by Andile Mngxitama following his expulsion from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema. Mngxitama‚Äôs chief policy is ‚Äòexpropriation without compensation‚Äô of white-owned land, which he declares to have been directly stolen from Africans. On this issue, he has accused EFF of selling out to the ANC, which he regards as too friendly to business interests. BLF has been supportive of South Africa‚Äôs ex-President Jacob Zuma, and has also shown support for the influential Gupta family. Its policies have been labelled as black supremacist and racist. Some of its members have been accused of threatening investigative journalists. In early-2019, the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) appealed to have the BLF deregistered. The IEC officially annulled the party registration on 15 July 2019 as a result of its violation of the Electoral Act, which prohibits limiting membership on the basis of race.FF+ gets BLF de-registered as a political party. Retrieved on 15 July 2019.BLF registration as political party is unlawful, IEC rules. Retrieved on 15 July 2019. The Electoral Court dismissed BLF's appeal in November 2019 and upheld an earlier ruling that the organisation can not be regarded as a political party. In November 2019, the movement decided to amend its constitution to allow Whites to be members of the movement. In an interview a few days later, the movement's Zanele Lwana slammed the media for \\"deliberately reporting untruthfully on what happened\\" in the conference. The movement's Deputy President said that the motive was more to allow its admittance on the IEC rather than to welcome Whites. History Andile Mngxitama served as an EFF member of parliament after the party won 25 seats in the 2014 general election, the first elections ever contested by the EFF after their founding the previous year. Mngxitama became unhappy with EFF leadership after its inaugural elective conference in December 2014. He accused EFF leadership, and in particular its founder Julius Malema, of having the \\"same tendencies as the ANC\\", a party that Malema had been expelled from in 2012. These accusations caused a rift in the EFF, a rift that widened in February 2015 when the two sides \\"came to blows\\" following accusations that Malema had made a deal with the ANC to help get Mngxitama and his sympathisers out of parliament. Mngxitama and two of his comrades, Mpho Ramakatsa and Khanyisile Litchfield-Tshabalala, were expelled in April. Mngxitama was perturbed by this development, and condemned the EFF of being a \\"watered-down version of the ANC\\". His main policy disagreement was the EFF's abandonment of his ideas of land reform, the \\"principle of expropriation without compensation\\" of white-owned land. This had always been an essential issue for Mngxitama, who had voiced his opinion to no avail during his tenure on the parliamentary Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform. He accused Malema of \\"selling out\\" on the issue, labelling him a \\"revisionist\\". This stated commitment to radical land reform would become the selling point of the Black First Land First manifesto. In 2016-2017, after accusing the EFF of having the same tendencies as the ruling ANC, BLF came out in support of former ANC and South African President Jacob Zuma, who has faced numerous corruption charges. BLF have also shown support for the controversial Gupta family, who have been widely accused of \\"capturing\\" the South African state through their dealings with Zuma. Questions have been asked to what extent the Guptas have been funding Andile Mngxitama and BLF, and whether the Guptas intended to use BLF to escalate racial tensions in order to distract from their controversial activities. In August 2017, Mngxitama exhorted the South African Reserve Bank to seize white farms and to initiate the formation of a black bank. In July 2017, e-mails surfaced suggesting that Mngxitama received instructions from the Gupta family and their contracted PR company Bell Pottinger. Bell Pottinger was subsequently suspended by the British Public Relations and Communications Association for \\"exploiting and creating racial divisions in South Africa\\" for five years.  Policies  In its \\"Revolutionary Call\\" released on 13 August 2015, BLF notes that, \\"[w]ithout land there is no freedom or dignity. We want Land First because it is the basis of our freedom, our identity, our spiritual well-being, our economic development and culture. The land of Africans was stolen and this theft has rendered us landless in our own land. We want all the land with all of its endowments on its surface together with all the fortunes underground as well as the sky. All of it belongs to us! We are a people crying for our stolen land! Now we have decided to get it back by any means necessary\\" SCI: \\"By any means necessary means without regard to famine, bloodshed or deteriorating as Zimbabwe did as our spiritual well-being demands it\\". Founder Mngxitama also made it clear that BLF has a policy called \\"Code of dealing with house negroes and sell outs\\". This is a ten-point code touted as a guide for party members to defend black people they differ with who come under attack from white supremacy.https://blf.org.za/2017/01/09/black-first-land-firsts-blackcode/ Colours and logo The logo of the Black First Land First (BLF) movement is the Sankofa Bird, forming part of a clenched black fist, with the base forming a fountain pen. The Sankofa Bird is a symbol for understanding a people engaged in the struggle for freedom through the power of revolutionary historical lessons. In this regard, the Sankofa bird, while looking backwards, flies forward with an egg in its mouth. The clenched black fist symbolises Black Power, and the fountain pen signifies the importance of revolutionary theory as a guide to action in the revolutionary struggle. At the centre of the Sankofa's wing is the five pointed red star. The five-pointed red star symbolises socialism and the blood of blacks whose lives were lost through the anti-blackness of white supremacy. Moreover, the five points of the star represent the five continents and hence an internationalist outlook in pursuit of the total freedom of all the oppressed peoples of the world. The circle is coloured in green to signify the Land and all the minerals beneath it that must be returned to the people. The circle itself, with its red outer and black inner boundary lines, serves to protect the people engaged in revolution. Structure According to its Constitution, The BLF operates under the Leninist party organisational structure known as democratic centralism. There are 4 chief organs of the party, arranged in the following hierarchy: # The National Imbizo which elects the National Coordinating Committee # The Provincial Imbizo which elects the Provincial Coordinating Committee # The Regional Imbizo which elects the Regional Coordinating Committee # The Branch Biennial General Imbizo which elects the Branch Coordinating Committee The National Imbizo, as the supreme ruling body, will convene at least once every 5 years. It is responsible for electing the members of the National Coordinating Committee (NCC) including the Secretary General. This is very similar to the relationship between the Party Congress and the Central Committee in Marxist-Leninist parties. The BLF Constitution mandates the 50% of the seats in both the NCC and its subcommittee, the Central Committee (CC), be occupied by women. The lower level Imbizos and Coordinating Committees function in a similar fashion. Ideology Mngxitama has stated that the party's core ideologies are Black Consciousness and Pan- Africanism with a Sankarist leadership ethos. BLF describes itself as a \\"vanguard organisation\\"; while it is not clear what BLF means by that, the party believes that no revolution can take place without a vanguard organisation. Its activities have led to it being called a supporter of black supremacy. The party was registered with the Independent Electoral Commission and contested the 2019 elections but won no representation in parliament or the provincial legislatures. The party's registration was annulled on 15 July 2019.  Controversies = Threatening of politicians = In July 2017 a BLF member was accused of harassing and sending death threats to ANC MP Makhosi Khoza following Khoza's criticisms of President Zuma. Khoza was among a few ANC Members of Parliament urging other members to vote with their conscience in a vote of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. In a series of text messages, Khoza was urged to vote against the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma or face death. Threats escalated towards Khoza's children and Khoza was also told that she had 21 days to live. Founder Mngxitama denied the accusations and argued that Khoza is loud and irrelevant, as well as that Khoza is black and that BLF will never threaten a black person. Mngxitama further stated that there must be a white person behind the threats. BLF Launched their own investigation into the accusations regarding the threats against Makhosi Khoza. BLF argued that Daily Maverick is a white monopoly capital publication that manufactured the story to increase Makhosi Khoza's public image in order to facilitate in a pro-white monopoly capital break-away party from the ANC. = Harassment of journalists = Ferial Haffajee  BLF Leader, Mngxitama, has been implicated in a sexual smear campaign against Huffington Post editor-at-large Ferial Haffajee. Various images of Haffajee came to light with amateur photo manipulation depicting Haffajee in various acts with South African businessman Johann Rupert. An army of fake Twitter accounts, also known as \\"Paid Twitter\\", retweeted and spread the images over social media. The only real accounts found spreading the images were BLF leader Andile Mngxitama, Decolonisation Foundation's Mzwanele Manyi and Uncensored Opinion's Pinky Khoabane. The Paid Twitter campaign has since been linked to UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger, employed by the Gupta family to spread fake news and discredit journalists that speak out against President Zuma or the Gupta Family. BLF's sister publication, Black Opinion, has since expressed their discontent with Haffajee, stating that she is a Black Liberal acting in favour of White Monopoly Capital.  Peter Bruce and Tim Cohen  Tiso Blackstar editor- at-large Peter Bruce and Business Day editor Tim Cohen were intimidated and assaulted by BLF members after publishing an article about the Gupta family. The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) expressed concerns over intimidation of journalists by BLF and cited the South African Constitution Section 15 and 16 addressing free press and freedom of religion and opinion. The South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF) applied for an urgent interdict to stop BLF members from harassing and intimidating journalists. SANEF further gave BLF the opportunity for assurance that they will not further intimidate journalists. BLF, however, declined and released a statement in which they listed other white journalists whom they indicated would be next on their target list. Among other parties who expressed their concern was the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, who condemned the intended target list by BLF. After being taken to court by SANEF, BLF, through their publication arm Black Opinion, accused SANEF of being racist white journalists and the poodle of White Monopoly Capital. BLF further accused the non-white journalists who form part of the SANEF court case as 'house negroes' who suffer from an identity crisis. BLF stated that they will take action only against the white journalists who form part of the court case.  Micah Reddy  BLF members were accused of harassing and assaulting investigative journalist for amaBhungane, Micah Reddy, following the filming of a televised debate on the subject of fake news in South Africa. BLF founder Andile Mngxitama was of the opinion that Reddy provoked BLF members and further stated that Reddy can be lucky he is black because BLF will never assault a black person. = Views on climate change = In June 2017, leader Andile Mngxitama blamed white monopoly capital for a severe storm that hit Cape Town the preceding week. Mngxitama is of the opinion that climate change is the fault of \\"capitalism and racism\\". Mngxitama stated that white people have assaulted nature and that Africa is now paying for these assaults. He further argues that there are no natural disasters, only white-made disasters such as droughts and earthquakes. Mngxitama also stated that the blame for deaths caused by the Cape Storm should be placed at the feet of the Oppenheimer and Rupert family as well as the Democratic Alliance. = Hate speech = In September 2018, Spokesperson Lyndsay Maasdorp told The Citizen reporter Daniel Friedman that as a white person his existence is \\"a crime\\". Maasdorp also posted on his now-suspended Twitter account, in 2018, \\"I have aspirations to kill white people, and this must be achieved!\\". In December 2018, in response to comments made by Johann Rupert in support of the South African taxi industry, Mngxitama asserted at a BLF rally that \\"For each one person that is being killed by the taxi industry, we will kill five white people\\", giving rise to the BLF slogan \\"1:5\\". Mngxitama went on to say, \\"You kill one of us, we will kill five of you. We will kill their children, we will kill their women, we will kill anything that we find on our way.\\" The comments were criticized by many, including the African National Congress, with an ANC spokesperson claiming that \\"[Mngxitama's] comments clearly incite violence in South Africa\\" and urged the South African Human Rights Commission to investigate. The Congress of the People and Democratic Alliance also criticized the statements and filed criminal charges against Mngxitama for incitement of violence. Mngxitama's Twitter account was also suspended as a result. In response, the BLF‚Äôs deputy president, Zanele Lwana, responded that Mngxitama's comments were made in the context of self defence and \\"The only sin committed by BLF president is defending black people. President Mngxitama correctly stated that for every one black life taken, five whites would be taken!\\" Election results=National elections= - ! Election ! Total votes ! Share of vote !

Overview According to Second Stage, \\"Lynn Nottage draws upon the screwball films of the 1930s to take a funny and irreverent look at racial stereotypes in Hollywood. By the Way, Meet Vera Stark is a 70-year journey through the life of Vera Stark, a headstrong African-American maid and budding actress, and her tangled relationship with her boss, a white Hollywood star...desperately grasping to hold on to her career.\\"Jones, Kenneth. \\"A Hollywood Story: Lynn Nottage's 'By the Way, Meet Vera Stark' Begins NYC World Premiere\\" playbill.com, April 6, 2011 The title character of Vera Stark is based in part on black actress Theresa Harris. Critical response Ben Brantley, reviewing the Off-Broadway production for The New York Times, wrote: \\"There are moments throughout Vera Stark, directed by Jo Bonney, that provoke hearty laughter and troubling thoughts at the same time. But none of them come close to matching the fully inhabited, spiky ambivalence of Ms. Lathan as she appears in the second half...But much of the comic material here feels stereotyped in itself, bringing to mind lively but formulaic sketch routines from satiric variety shows like In Living Color. As directed by Ms. Bonney, the acting swings wildly between proper characterization and caricature...More enjoyably, the second act includes a clip from the film that Vera finally made (as imagined by Tony Gerber) and the priceless 1973 talk-show sequence, in which Mr. Garrison is perfect as a fatuous Merv Griffin-esque host.\\" Charles McNulty, in his review of the Off- Broadway production for The Los Angeles Times, wrote: \\"The subject of racism in the film industry might not seem like an ideal fit for a comedy with a screwball twist, but Nottage is too clever to preach and too much a fan of the cinematic era she‚Äôs writing about not to entertain. The giddiness of the romp isn‚Äôt easy to sustain, but her sneaky cultural critique is delivered with an ingenious wink...Nottage is attuned to the specific hardships of African American actors coveting fame throughout history, and her irony detector can‚Äôt help beeping as it surveys all the social progress that has been made. But she‚Äôs also aware of how anyone in the public eye is forced to sell a part of his or her soul. In this regard, she‚Äôs an equal opportunity satirist, sending up the performing seal in all of us.\\"McNulty, Charles. \\"Theater review: 'By the Way, Meet Vera Stark' at Second Stage Theatre\\" Los Angeles Times, May 9, 2011 Bob Verini, in his review for Variety of the Geffen Playhouse production, wrote: \\"Nottage and Bonney seem to lack much appreciation of, or respect for, the Tinseltown milieu...The second half nevertheless proves richer and more satisfying. For starters three academics, hilariously doubled by Carroll, Gregory and Dandridge, practically come to blows at a modern-day seminar on the meaning of a career that ended in lousy roles, humiliation and eventual disappearance...All the pieces of Nottage‚Äôs puzzle never quite click together, and it‚Äôs rather ironic for a work whose theme is personal and professional authenticity to keep bringing in so much that‚Äôs downright bogus.\\" Awards and nominations ;2012 Drama Desk Award Nominations Gans, Andrew. \\"Drama Desk Nominations Announced; 'Death Takes a Holiday' and 'Follies' Lead the Pack\\" playbill.com, April 27, 2012 *Outstanding Play, Lynn Nottage *Outstanding Actress in a Play, Sanaa Lathan *Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play, Stephanie J.

It has smooth, shiny bark on its trunk and branches, lance-shaped leaves, pendulous flower buds arranged in groups of seven, cream- coloured to pale lemon-coloured flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped or conical fruit. This tree has also been introduced to Victoria.flower budsflowersfruitbark Description The tree typically grows to a height of and can get to tall. It has smooth grey-brown coloured bark that peels from the trunk and branches. It blooms from August to December and produces white cream to yellow flowers. At breast height the trunk has a diameter of around . It is drought tolerant and grows in areas with rainfall of per year. The concolorous, glossy, green adult leaves have an alternate arrangement. The leaf blade has a lanceolate shape and are long and wide. The unbranched inflorescences have an axillary arrangement. Each inflorescence is seven- flowered with flattened peduncles around flattened. The buds are pedicellate with a stubby to elongated shape. The fruits that form later are pedicellate and cupular to campanulate. Each fruit is around with a diameter of around . They each have a level to descending disc with three or four valves containing grey-black seeds with an ovoid to flattened-ovoid shape. Taxonomy Brown mallet was first formally described in 1911 by Joseph Maiden who gave it the name Eucalyptus occidentalis var. astringens and published the description in the Journal of the Natural History and Science Society of Western Australia. In 1924, Maiden raised the variety to species status in his book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The specific epithet (astringens) is a Latin word meaning \\"shrinking\\" or \\"binding\\". In 2002, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies: * Eucalyptus astringens subsp. astringens is a taller mallet with flower buds usually longer than ; * Eucalyptus astringens subsp. redacta is a smaller mallet with smaller buds and fruit than the autonym. Distribution Brown mallet is commonly found on rocky outcrops, ridges, breakaways, hills and on valley floors in the southern Wheatbelt, Great Southern and south west Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. It grows in red-brown gravelly clay, brown clayey sand, sandy loam, spongolite, laterite and sandstone based soils. It is commonly associated with E. wandoo making up the overstorey, especially when E. wandoo woodland is an adjacent community. Understorey species often include occasional Santalum acuminatum and Melaleuca scalena, and a sparse ground cover of common grasses and herbs such as Thysanotus patersonii, Trachymene pilosa, Pterostylis sanguineus, Austrostipa elegantissima, Austrodanthonia setacea group and Lomandra micrantha subsp. micrantha. E. astringens has become naturalised in Bacchus Marsh, north of Melbourne, in Victoria, where it had been used to stabilise soils. Uses The wood from the tree is used for construction, mining timbers and for tool handles. It is also a good firewood. The bark contains around 40% tannin and could possibly be used for tanning leather and production of adhesives. Around of the tree have been planted around Narrogin in plantations for timber production.

White House is a historic house at 1 Church Street in Belfast, Maine. Built in 1840, it is one of the city's most elaborate examples of Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and is included in Belfast's Church Street Historic District. In recent years it has served as a bed and breakfast inn but, as of 2015, is a private residence once again. Description and history The White House is located south of Belfast's central business district, at the southern end of Church Street, occupying a triangular lot at the corner of High Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof topped by a widow's walk and cupola, and a granite foundation. The front and sides are finished in flushboard siding, with clapboards elsewhere. The building corners have oversides pilasters with Doric capitals, rising to a multi-level entablature that encircles the building. The main facade is three bays wide, the center one projecting and rising to a gabled roof. The main entrance, and a second floor balcony entrance, are both recessed in this projecting, the recessed area articulated by pilasters and fluted columns. The house was designed by Calvin Ryder, a local architect, for James Patterson White, and was completed in 1840. White, a Belfast native, was a successful businessman who served for two years as mayor. Later owners of the house have included James Taliaferro, a Florida Senator who owned it as a summer residence. In the late 20th century the building served as a bed and breakfast inn. By 2015, the White House is a private residence once again.

The series premiered on PBS Kids on February 15, 2016. It was created by animator and Hey Arnold! creator Craig Bartlett, and is produced in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The show teaches science and astronomy. The show is aimed at kids ages 3 to 8. On August 17, 2016, PBS Kids announced the renewal of the series for a second season, which premiered on April 2, 2018. Plot Jet Propulsion and his family are from the fictional planet Bortron 7 which orbits around a red dwarf called Bortron. They live at Boxwood Terrace in Washington, https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/seattle-native-returns-to-the- small-screen-with-ready-jet-go/ where they study human customs and Earth environments for a travel guide. Jet has made friends with neighborhood kids, including Sydney, Mindy, and Sean, whose parents work at the nearby Deep Space Array. The Propulsions' car turns into a flying saucer, which they frequently use to take the older kids into space. Their alien identities are known to Sean, Mindy, and Sydney, but they otherwise make some effort to conceal their origin. As of early June 2016, it's unclear whether anyone else knows who they really are. At the end of each episode, scientist Amy Mainzer (also called Astronomer Amy) hosts educational interstitial segments: the segments are not included in the export version. EpisodesCharacters * Jet Propulsion (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is the title character of the show and is a humanoid alien. He has red hair and can stretch his body, as his parents can. He is excitable, energetic, and goofy. He is tall for his age. Jet is 63 years old in Bortronian years, as revealed in \\"Earthday Birthday\\". He was instantly popular with the other children the moment he arrived on Earth. He sees the mundane world as a vast and exciting place, and even thinks that words are exciting, such as \\"surprise\\", claiming it to be a funny Earth word. He is named after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is shown to be extremely kind, even to people who are mean to him, such as Mitchell. He possibly likes Sydney, because he danced with her in \\"How Come the Moon Changes Shape?\\", and is shown to possibly like Sean in \\"Back to Bortron 7\\". * Sunspot Propulsion is the Propulsion family pet. He is described as a dog or cat to \\"Earthies\\" not in the know. Sunspot has the ears of a rabbit, the body of a kangaroo, and the tail of a raccoon or a fox. He plays concertina, electric guitar, bugle, pan pipes, and drums. Sunspot is silly and likes to play. His status as a mere \\"pet\\" may be somewhat of a put-on: He knows how to read, can talk and sing, and can follow conversations, but often seems confused about what behaviors are expected from a pet. He often functions as a deus ex machina, figuring out what is going on and what needs to be done and then conveying that information to one or more of the children. Carrot and Jet both realize there's more to Sunspot than the obvious, as evidenced by a conversation in \\"The Greatest Canyon\\": Carrot: \\"You ever get the idea there's something he's not telling us?\\" Jet: \\"All the time, Dad. All the time.\\" * Carrot Propulsion (voiced by Kyle Rideout) is Jet's father. His name from his home planet includes the sound of an elephant trumpeting and a parrot squawking. He tends to be goofy, like Jet. He often stays home while Celery takes the kids on adventures into outer space, as he doesn't really like going in the flying saucer. Carrot often cooks wacky dishes such as deep-fried lollipops. * Celery Propulsion (voiced by Meg Roe) is Jet's mother. Celery is smart and often takes the kids to space. Her name from her home planet includes the sounds of banging, buzzing, and clanging. She normally drives the family vehicle, as Carrot's driving makes her nervous. She likes racing against her brother, Zucchini. * Face 9000 (voiced by Brian Drummond) is a computer. He is a cyan face with blue facial features projected from a small, round ball. He has a younger brother, Face 9001. Face 9000 knows everything about science, and often pops up to answer the kids' science questions. In \\"Face on the Fritz\\", he gets an upgrade. He has a tendency to get jealous easily. Songs Ready Jet Go! has many songs; some have no lyrics. The bottom ones do not have lyrics. #Ready Jet Go!

Jet's excitement for the human experience is matched only by Sean and Sydney's eagerness to learn all about outer space; put the three of them together, and it's a true celebration of the joy of discovery. Whether it's executing a rescue mission for a Mars rover or combining daily chores with experiments in force, Jet and his friends have a lot to teach kids through their own experiences.\\" Gina Catanzarite of Parent's Choice said \\"Although the vocabulary and science explanations may be beyond the scope of the youngest viewers, the premise, characters, interesting art direction and upbeat action should hold their attention. Older kids are more likely to grasp the facts and even if they don't remember them all, Ready Jet Go! will at the very least inspire curiosity, and plenty of questions when they take the time to gaze up at the skies above them.\\" Awards and nominations *The series was awarded a Parents' Choice Silver Honor. **The series won a Parents' Choice Award again in 2018. *The series was awarded a Common Sense Seal by Common Sense Media. *Jaeda Lily Miller was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her performance as Mindy Games PBS Kids and Two Moos created ten online games based on the show #Sydney's Astro-Tracker #Mindy's Constellation Exploration #Sean's Rescue Quest #Jet's Planet Pinball #Jet's Rocket Ship Creator #Mission Earth #Mindy's Moonball #Jet's Bot Builder #Rover Maker #Cooking School Also on iTunes: #Space Explorer released 7 April 2016 Parodies and spoofs/usage with other shows=Usage with other shows= In \\"Mindy's Weather Report\\" (15b), an image for Dinosaur Train, another PBS Kids series and also created by Bartlett, can be seen when Sunspot flips over the channels on Face.

There are various visible ways in which people and cultures consciously and unconsciously maintain binary heteronormative norms, which involve choices of female or male gender actions and performances. Common body practices, or gestures, are combined with gender expectations that make it hard to recognize these practices. Three examples of heteronormative disciplines are gendered attractiveness, embodied space, and body movement. Gendered attractiveness Gendered attractiveness is the physical appearance of a male or female that is considered ideal, beautiful, attractive and having sex appeal of oneself or others. Males, for example, should be large in stature, muscular, full head of hair, straight white teeth, healthy and alluring to look at. They spend many hours trying to perfect their bodies with physical exercise. They also make changes to their appearance with hair removal, hair plugs, teeth veneers and body tanning. Males want to be seen as strong, dominant and masculine. Females, on the other hand, should be slender, tall, have long blonde hair, perfect skin and Barbie doll-like features. Females want to be characterized as petite, skinny and fit. The problem is that \\"tall\\" and \\"petite\\" are opposites. Females are concerned about how they look, what they wear and they desire to be attractive, and thus go to great lengths to make sure that they feel and look attractive and polished. Females make permanent changes to their bodies as they have cosmetic surgery on all areas of their bodies such as, nose, face, lips, chin, teeth, breast, buttock, feet and many other parts of the body. Females also make temporary changes such as cut and color hair, tanning for darker skin color, hair removal from body, paint finger and toe nails. In addition, females use clothes, shoes and accessories such as scarfs, jewelry, purses and eyeglasses to help make them feel and look attractive. Embodied space Embodied space is the way males and females familiarize with their bodies in their surroundings and often compare to each other. The area of personal and interpersonal space tends to be diverse and has various levels for different genders and how it is used to disciple one's self and others. Males and females also experience their bodies in different ways such as females are more guarded in the way they experience their bodies than males who are less guarded. The size of personal space also had to do with gender. Females compared to males take up less space and males tend to spread out. An example would be when a female sits in a chair they normally sit straight up with legs crossed and when male sits in the chair they sprawl out and legs are spread. Body movement Body movement is how one moves their bodies or how someone's attitude or manners help to express how one carries themselves. Each gender has specific flow or body movements that are normal for them. Females experience their bodies in more guarded way, how to hamper their movement and do not bring their whole bodies into motion. Females are told how to sit, stand and walk properly. Females are more nonverbal and tend to use more facial expressions and more body movement than males. Males are taught to use and abuse their bodies and put their bodies into an aggressive motion. Males have more expansive movements and show higher levels of activity than females.

Annaglogh Mine is shown on the 1856 2nd edition OS map. History Collapsed shaft in July 2010 There is information on the mining activities in the area recorded in the Geological Survey Of Ireland Memoirs by FW Egan. Production at Annaglogh is listed in Mineral Statistics from 1852 to 1855, though the mine continued to be listed up to 1865. There were four shafts and an engine house, which are shown on the 1870 GSI Map. The remains of the mine's chimney and old spoil heaps are evident, however the residence of the mining agent was demolished in circa 2007 and (as of 2016) there was development of a new residence on the same site. The operation was run by Captain James Skimming (1817-1880), who was also the Mining Agent for the North Eastern Mining Company of Ireland which also encompassed nearby Lisdrumgormley, Coolartragh (Bond Mine), Lemgare Mines, and Hope Mines near Castleblayney.http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001223/18591008/023/0002 The North Eastern Mining Company of Ireland was formed on Monday 6 April 1846 at The Angel Hotel in Liverpool by way of a shareholders meeting. The entire working capital of the company was ¬£8000. Captain Skimming and the Cornish mining engineer George Henwood, were also said to be involved in a project in the West of Ireland called the Galway & Mayo United Mining Company in and around 1859-1860. They were said to have extensive mining licences in the area which amounted to 120 square miles. Tasson Mine (1853-1867) was operated by under the direction of Captain Joseph Backhouse initially. The Castleblayney Mining Company was the operator between (1862‚Äì65) and the mine was deemed to be closed by 1867. Lisdrumgormley was recorded in 1922 as being under development by The Farney Development Company. Captain Skimming resided in Annaglogh Castleblayney during his time in Ireland, and died here in 1880. He was predeceased by his wife Elizabeth who died in 1872.  Individual mines = Coolartragh Mines = History: According to the GSI 6\\" Sheet and MSS notes, about seven shafts were opened on the vein that traverses the townland from south to north. Griffith (1861, p. 150) is the authority for identifying Coolartragh as also being known as the Bond Mine. The UK Department of Trade & Industry and the BGS .possesses a plan, and a section down to 35 fathoms, showing four levels, dated 1892 (AM 2986). The Bond Mine operated by the Consolidated Mines of Bond, Lemgare and Lisdrumgormel (sic) Company of Liverpool under Captain John Skimming was reported in 1846 (Mining Journal) to have been developed at the 18, 25 and 30 fathom levels where the vein was large and productive with bunches of rich ore and that the vein had been explored for nearly \\"1 mile of length\\" The engine shaft is said to have been vertical and cut the lode at 30 fathoms, and a large and valuable amount of ore is supposed to remain yet un-extracted. This lode is considered to be identical with the main Tassan Vein. It has an underlie to the east at 60o, and its course appears to have been proved beyond doubt both north and south of the main sinking. The matrix here is chiefly quartz, with some calcite; and a considerable quantity of sphalerite is said to occur along with the lead. = Tonagh Mine = Two small shafts were sunk close to the boundary of Coolartragh and Tonagh townlands. And some minor production ensued between 1859-61 when the vein showed a band of galena underlying to the east within a zone of brecciated slates above a footwall of Tertiary basalt. A landowner (Michael Hughes) proposed to dewater the shafts in Tonagh in 1953 but nothing came of this. No production is detailed. = Lemgare Mine = In the townland of Lemgare an adit and three shafts along a strike length of 50 fathoms (95m) were sunk to a depth of 18 fathoms (35m) below adit on a nearly vertical vein by the Consolidated Mines of Bond, Lemgare and Lisdrumgormel (sic) Company of Liverpool under Captain John Skimming commencing in July 1846. The vein is supposed to be the same as that at Annaglogh, located approximately 1 km to the SSE, which are marked on the MS. 6‚Ä≥ map of the Geological Survey. Griffith (1861, p. 150) gives Lemgare as a worked mine. Mem. 59, p. 28, regards it as on the continuation of the Annaglogh lode. The Lemgare vein has been profitably worked at Annaglogh. It heads easterly at around 75o, and is joined from the north by another, also heading easterly at around 60o. A shaft at the junction reached rich ore at 17 fathoms (~30m). The lode is supposed to be thrown northwards by a cross-course about 1.2m wide which exists as indicated on the map, as all trace of it is lost farther to the east, it is believed to have been proved 150m farther north. Lemgare Mine was re-opened by Billiton NV in the early 1950s as part of prospecting activities. The adit extended along an unmineralized fault zone for approximately 110m, being connected to surface by a short (4m) ventilation shaft near the portal. Upon entering sandstone wall-rocks the fault became mineralized and some stoping was seen to surface (20m) near the end of the drive which extended but was inaccessible but almost certainly extends below two surface shaft collapse located above. An inclined shaft or winze to indeterminate depth (presumably to 18 fathoms (~35m) was also located along the course of the adit with a 10 cm rib of galena on the fault plane. = Annaglogh Mine = This mine is known to have been in production in 1852 and features in the list of mines between 1860-65 when it was being worked by the Consolidated Mines of Bond, Lemgare and Lisdrumgormel (sic) Company of Liverpool under Captain John Skimming. During this period approximately 300-400 tonnes of ore was reported as being raised annually. The 1870 MSS 6‚Ä≥ map of the Geological Survey gives details of four shafts one of which was sunk as much as 40 fathoms (~75m) on the vein, and a pumping engine house. The sites of several of these, along with the base of the engine house and its associated chimney are still visible. The only output from Annaglogh is recorded in 1852 when 310 tons of lead was produced and \\"some lead sold\\" in 1853. = Tassan Mine = This was probably the most important mine of the district. The townland adjoins that of Tonagh on the south, and the vein is the same as that which passes northward into Coolartragh. The mine was commenced in the late 1840s by Joseph Backhouse as the Tassan Mining Company 1844-56, but the most significant period of working was by the Castleblayney Mining Company from 1856‚Äì61 and from 1862-5; but it seems to have been closed in 1867. There are five shafts marked on the 1857 6\\" OSI map although little trace remains of them at the present time. = Lisdrumgormley Mine = The 6‚Ä≥ Geological Survey MSS map marks two veins continuing northward from those of Annaglogh, and the western of these was reached at no great depth in Lisdrumgormley, just east of a basaltic dyke that is probably correlated with this fault / vein. In the north of the townland, close against the Armagh border, \\"Lead Mine\\" is engraved on the 6\\" Ordnance sheet. Lisdrumgormley was also under exploration by the Farney Development Company in 1922. The lode in Lisdrumgormley is reported, on contemporary authority, to be still rich in argentiferous galena, embedded in a matrix of quartz and carbonate of lime in the deepest workings. so far as it is known, from 2 to 9 feet. This lode, which comes to the surface at the main working, is said to have realized a large profit at depths not exceeding 25 fathoms. A shaft located some 250m SSE along strike of the vein is reported to have attained 60m depth and returned 50 tonnes of lead concentrates.  Planning application (2016) = Report and hearing = EirGrid, a state-owned electric power transmission operator in Ireland, proposed a new electricity inter-connector between Counties Tyrone and Meath which crosses from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland at Lemgare and runs through the townlands of Lisdrumgormley and Annaglogh - all of which had extensive mining operations in them. On Day 34 of the Oral Hearing (13 May 2016) a report and research were presented to the hearing which was chaired by An Bord Pleanala inspectors. Maurice McAdam, as part of his initial submission to An Bord Pleanala, had raised the issue of the uncharted mine workings in the Lemgare, Lisdrumgormley and Annaglogh area posed a series of questions to EirGrid, in particular about the research that they had carried out. Mr McAdam had questioned Eirgrid regarding the \\"incurred liability & associated costs\\" and the potential for harm or even death by collapse of underground mine workings in the area. Mr McAdam, a civil engineering contractor in the UK, stated that the project he was currently engaged in North & South Lanarkshire had extensive mine workings. Extensive research and ground penetrating radar was used along with historical maps of the underground network was carried out prior to extensive grouting and rehabilitation of all known mines and shafts. All shafts were capped also. He made the point that EirGrid had not considered this scope of works whatsoever with relation to the areas of mine workings in Lemgare, Lisdrumgormley & Annaglogh relative to their proposed development. He then introduced Dr. Colin Andrew, a mining geologist from County Meath and member of the \\"North East Pylon Pressure\\" (NEPP) campaign, whom he had commissioned to carry out additional research and collate information from both his and Dr Andrew's own findings into a report- which was submitted to the inspectors at the hearing. = Extent of Mine Workings = Because of a combination of the age of the mine workings for lead in this area coupled with the short-lived nature of the various formalised cost-book companies that operated the mines, the records of the extent of workings are obscure. Most of the cost-book companies were not floated on the London Stock Exchange as was common practice at this time and, as a result, did not return reports that were then published in the contemporary Mining Journal. Dr Andrew claimed that in their assessment of the extent and impact of mine workings EirGrid had solely relied upon the information received from the GSI and EPA and did not appear to have conducted any detailed research. The GSI have admitted in correspondence concerning the extent of mine workings in the area that they ‚Äú..do not necessarily capture the full extent of a feature, particularly if it is inaccessible and impractical..‚Äù and thus do not have information detailing the extent of mine workings such as shafts, trial pits, adits, stoped sections of veins and any lateral workings thereon. It is also worth noting that the other statutory body, the Environmental Protection Agency (\\"EPA\\") have also confirmed (to Maurice McAdam) that \\"As per your complaint to the EPA, in relation to the EPA Inventory of Disused Mine Sites 2009, this national inventory taken does not account of every mine site but is risk based taken to define the mine waste/spoil sites, the waste geo-chemistry and to account for Public Health and Safety.\\" In the opinion of Dr Andrew, it appears that the two statutory bodies are unaware of the locations of mine workings and their attendant risk and EirGrid have not conducted any form of site investigation. = EirGrid response to report = EirGrid stood by the accuracy and extent of the environmental impact statement and the basis on which they had carried out the research. They said none of the new information would change their assessment which had been done with the help of GSI information and LiDAR technology to provided details of the topography. The assessment they had already made of the Lemgare area which showed the old mine workings extending away from the area where the pylons would be going. In their response document published in December 2015 the company noted that a number of submissions raised issues in respect of the potential of the proposed development to impact on specific mines. = Mine works collapses in area = There was extensive mining operations in the townlands of Coolartragh, Lemgare and Lisdrumgormley. In recent years there have been several instances whereby the shaft/tunnel networks of some of these disused mine locations have collapsed. # Whilst ongoing Quarry Operations were being carried out in Lemgare Quarry, uncharted underground mine shafts from that of Coolartragh Mines were uncovered in early 2000. # In 2010 in Annaglogh on the property of Philip McAdam there was an instance where 2 mine shafts collapsed and these were subsequently back-filled and made safe by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The actual works were carried out by the OPW (Office of Public Works). prior to this one of the same shafts collapsed in the late 1960s and was filled in by Monaghan County Council. # In 2012 on the site of the disused Lisdrumgormley lead Mine, within property of James Watters there was also a shaft collapse whereby the Office of Public Works also made the area safe. # There have been several instances where the shaft at the mine head location (as shown on the sketch in Annaglogh) where the actual Mine's Chimney was located has collapsed throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and each time the landowner, Patrick Morgan back-filled this himself as he was quite unaware of the role of the state in making sure these shafts were safe.

It is a well-preserved late 18th to early 19th century farmstead, now owned and operated by the local historical society as a museum property. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Peabody- Fitch property is located in southern Bridgton, on a rise known locally as Fitch Hill on the south side of Ingalls Road, west of Maine State Route 107. The farmstead is set amid former agricultural fields and woods, which contain landscaped evidence of the property's former use, including stone walls, fences, and former roadways. The farmstead consists of a rambling farmhouse, a barn, and a smaller wood frame structure that once served as a blacksmith's shop. The farmhouse is a two-story clapboarded wood frame structure to which a series of additions have been made, most before 1850. The barn is a timber frame structure with a sliding door, and a small shed-roof addition at one end. The blacksmith's shop is a single story wood frame structure, with a single door and three windows. The main block of the house was probably built in 1797 by William Peabody, one of Bridgton's first settlers. The house remained in the hands of his descendants, mostly named Fitch, until 1910. It was purchased as a summer retreat in 1937 by Margaret Monroe of Providence, Rhode Island, and was given by her heirs to the Bridgton Historical Society. Through these transitions, it has maintained the basic layout of a typical late-18th or early-19th century farmstead, with a detached barn and other outbuildings. The principal loss is of a much larger barn, whose foundational remains lie nearby. The house and farmstead are open by appointment, or during special events staged by the historical society.

The book won the 2015 Costa Book of the Year.  Synopsis  The Lie Tree is set in the male-dominated Victorian scientific society, and tells the story of Faith Sunderly, a 14-year-old girl whose father is killed in mysterious circumstances after the family moves to the fictional island of Vane. In her efforts to discover what happened to her father, and to follow his footsteps of studying natural science, she discovers a tree that provides truths by feeding on whispered lies. The bigger the lie, the more people who believe it, the bigger the truth that is uncovered. The girl realizes that she is good at lying and that the tree might hold the key to her father's murder, so she begins to spread untruths far and wide across her small island community. But as her tales spiral out of control, she discovers that where lies seduce, truths shatter.  Reception  The Guardian praised The Lie Tree's \\"convincing picture of the times\\" and Hardinge's \\"trademark wit and intelligence\\", calling the book \\"at once entertaining and provocative\\". The Sunday Times named the book its children's book of the year for 2015. In the 2015 Costa Book Awards, The Lie Tree won both in the Children's Book Award category and the overall Book of the Year, an achievement only previously managed by Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass in 2001.

Girich claimed at least 17 victories against German aircraft during World War II. He was a squadron commander in the 486th Fighter Aviation Regiment during the war.  Early life  Girich was born on 28 December 1918 in Yahotyn to a working class family. He graduated from the Kiev River College in 1938. Girich learned to fly at the Kiev aeroclub. He also worked as the assistant captain of the Leningrad, a ship operated by the Dnieper River Shipping Company. In 1939, he was drafted into the Red Army and was sent to the Odessa Military Air College. In 1941, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  World War II  When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Girich was a flight leader in the 12th Fighter Aviation Regiment. On 25 June, he shot down a Junkers Ju 88 by frontal attack over Stanislaus. Girich intercepted and shot down a second Ju 88 over Lozova railway station on 28 September. In November, the regiment was sent to Crimea. On 5 November, Girich was awarded the Order of the Red Star.Order of the Red Star citation, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru On 26 December, the 12th Fighter Aviation Regiment became the 486th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Girich became a squadron commander in the regiment. On 3 February 1942, he shot down an Me 109 over Kerch Strait. In the air battle, his squadron shot down three more Me 109s without losing any aircraft. On 16 March, Girich's squadron tangled with twelve German fighters over Kerch Strait. In this engagement, Girich shot down another Me 109. On 9 May, six fighters led by Girich fought an air battle with 40 Me 109s over Karatch. The squadron shot down five Me 109s and Girich gained another victory. After being withdrawn from Crimea, the regiment was sent to Moscow for air defense in August. On 5 November, Girich shot down a Heinkel He 111 over Ostashkov. In the summer of 1943, the regiment was sent to the Central Front. Between 15 July and 8 December, Girich reportedly made 103 sorties, conducted 17 air battles and shot down seven German aircraft. On 4 September, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.Order No. 58 16th Air Army, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru On 6 September, he shot down a Ju 88 over Oblozhki. On 21 October, he shot down two Ju 88s over Kolpen and Ostrovy. In December, the regiment was sent to the rear for resupply but moved to Oryol in May 1944. It fought in Operation Bagration and the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive during the summer. In August, it transferred to the 5th Air Army and fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive. On 25 August, Girich shot down a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 over Hu»ôi. On 3 September, he claimed another Fw 190 over Ploie»ôti. By 20 September, when he was recommended for an award of the title Hero of the Soviet Union, Girich had made 439 sorties and shot down 15 enemy aircraft. On 23 September, he shot down another Fw 190 over Turda. From October, the regiment fought in the Budapest Offensive. Girich shot down a Me 190 over Isaszeg on 17 November. In January 1945, the German forces attempted to resupply Budapest by air. Girich reportedly shot down a Junkers Ju 52.

Buildings of the complex include several that date to the hatchery's founding as an experimental station in 1916. These include the original superintendent's office and residence, which now serves as its visitors' center, and the main hatchery building, a handsome Colonial Revival structure, both of which were completed in 1917. The fishery currently produces stocks of brown trout, brook trout and rainbow trout, which are distributed to Vermont's lakes and ponds. History The station was established by the state on an experimental basis in 1916, after an earlier experimental station in Arlington was found inadequate. This one was made permanent after the quality and reliability of its water sources was assured. It grew to become a model fish hatchery by the 1930s, distributing thousands of pounds of fingerlings and fry throughout the state. Its facilities were significantly expanded in the 1940s with funding from the Works Progress Administration.

The currents around the Point of Ayre have, over the millennia formed a series banks stretching out to the east which, it is advised, should be avoided especially in heavy weather when the seas break over them. There is also a problem in that chart depths on the west coast to the southwest of the Point of Ayre are based on Victorian lead line surveys and are no longer accurate, there being reports of depths as much as 2 meters less than that expected. For mariners approaching Ramsey from the north, it is suggested that the best course of action is to come in north of the Strunakill Bank then tight to the Point of Ayre. This allows the mariner to slip inside the Whitestone Bank, through the Whitestone Channel. Alternatively, if coming up from Peel, it is advisable to stand off Rue Point (southwest of Ayre) and then shape a course to pass between the Strunakill Bank and the Point. Going outside the Whitestone Bank to the east of the Point of Ayre involves committing the mariner to an unnecessarily long passage around the Bahama Bank.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 54% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.6 out of 10, based on 13 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Dead of Summer sets a spooky stage for a silly period creepfest, but its lack of actual scares adds up to an altogether underwhelming experience.\\" Molly Freeman of ScreenRant gave the series premiere a positive review stating, \\"While the premise of Dead of Summer sounds familiar to any horror movie fan, the show benefits from not being directly tied to an existing horror franchise since it won't suffer for being compared to movies beloved by generations.\\" Sonia Saraiya of Variety also wrote a positive review: \\"Dead of Summer makes for a schlocky hour that never quite gets boring. At the very least, while escaping the dog days of summer inside with the air-conditioning, there's plenty of fun to be had in laughing at how bad it is.\\" Alex McGown of The A.V. Club gave the first episode a C rating, stating \\"Its story is so clunky, and characters so wafer-thin, it all but evaporates into a haze of trite jump-scare beats and hoary teen tropes.\\" Dan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave a more negative review: \\"Dead of Summer is just run-of-the-mill unintentionally bad -- a mishmash of genres and structures and stock characters that maybe aspires to something original and falls flat.\\" As the series continued, reviews became more positive. Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic gave a perfect score of 5.0/5.0 to the fifth episode saying, \\"'How to Stay Alive in the Woods' was a stellar episode of the freshman drama.

The extant reports were sent between June 1941 and April 1942 to the Chief of the Security Police and the SD () in Berlin, from the occupied eastern territories including modern-day Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, and the Baltic Countries. During the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials the originals were grouped according to year and month and catalogued using a consecutive numbering system, as listed in the below table. The original photostats are held at the National Archives in Washington D.C..Yitzhak Arad, with Shmuel Krakowski and Shmuel Spector (1989), The Einsatzgruppen reports: selections from the dispatches of the Nazi Death Squads‚Äô campaign against the Jews July 1941-January 1943, New York, N.Y.: Holocaust Library. Edition details. Background Following the onset of Operation Barbarossa, during the first 5 weeks of their shooting actions, the Einsatzgruppen squads targeted primarily male Jews. This changed on July 29, 1941, when Reinhard Heydrich himself, quoted at an SS meeting in Vileyka (Polish Wilejka), criticized their leaders for the low execution figures. It was therefore ordered that the Jewish women and children be included in all subsequent shooting operations. The first women and children were killed along with the men on July 30, 1941, in Vileyka. The Nazi Einsatzgruppen were not the only formation tasked with the mass killings. Other formations included the Order Police battalions from Germany (Orpo) participating equally in the mass murder of Polish and Soviet Jews regardless of their age and sex, including in the territories of the formerly Soviet-occupied Poland (see the Red Friday massacre), the Baltic states, and in the USSR proper. Significant numbers of women and children were murdered behind all front lines not only by the Germans but also by the local Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliary forces. The largest mass shooting of Soviet Jews took place on September 29, 1941, in the ravine of Babi Yar near Kiev, where 33,771 Jews of all ages were machine-gunned (Situation Report No. 101). Original German cables After World War II, the reports were grouped and numbered by the Allies in order to summarize their content. The actual German cables were sent in their own differing sequence including by the Einsatzgruppe A (EG‚ÄìA) attached to Army Group North, Einsatzgruppe B (EG‚ÄìB) attached to Army Group Center, Einsatzgruppe C (EG-C) attached to the Army Group South, and Einsatzgruppe D (EG‚ÄìD) attached to the 11th Army. In the OSRs, individual Ereignismeldungen UdSSR (morning reports) abbr. EM, from EG‚ÄìA appear in 103 different places. The reports from EG‚ÄìB appear in 64 OCRs (as arranged by the Allies). The EG-C reports are listed in 77 different OCRs, and the reports from EG‚ÄìD (with the least representation at source) are featured in 63 OCRs. Occasionally, large gaps appear between individual reports, caused by the lack of time or other complications including broken telephone lines in the East. Notably, in Operational Situation Report number 19, Einsatzgruppe C was changed to Einsatzgruppe B and vice versa, thus confusing further reports of their shooting actions. The OSRs are far from being equal. Some of them, such as OSR 156, include translated cables from several cities and weeks of shooting actions not yet concluded with tens of thousands of victims mentioned; while other Operational Situation Reports, such as OSR 67, resemble long essays describing mere investigations into partisan activities in rural countryside resulting in dozens of executions. Notably, the reports do not include all killings before the end of 1942. The following selection of reports are available in English translation.

Early life  Rachidi is the son of Davoud Rashidi, a famous Iranian theatre actor and director. At the age of 3 months his family decided to move back to Iran . He attended Marika (Shahdokht Farahnaz) primary school and the French-Iranian Razi High-School in Tehran and obtained his high-school diploma in 1980. In the same year, he moved to Lausanne and started his education in Electrical engineering. He received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, in 1986 and 1991 respectively.  Career  Rachidi worked at the Power Systems Laboratory of the same institute until 1996 and had several short stays at the University of Florida and at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. In 1997, he joined the Lightning Research Laboratory of the University of Toronto in Canada and from April 1998 until September 1999, he was with Montena EMC in Switzerland. He is currently a Titular Professor and the head of the EMC Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. His research interests include lightning electromagnetics, electromagnetic compatibility, application of high power electromagnetics to humanitarian demining, and electromagnetic time reversal. In collaboration with Prof. C.A. Nucci of the University of Bologna, he has developed models for the evaluation of lightning electromagnetic radiation, which have been widely used in lightning-related engineering applications. One of the most important contributions made by Professor Rachidi is the development of a model describing the interaction of an exciting electromagnetic field and a transmission line. Dr. Rachidi served as the Vice-Chair of the European COST Action on the Physics of Lightning Flash and its Effects (2005-2009), the Chairman of the 2008 European Electromagnetics International Symposium (EUROEM), the President of the International Conference on Lightning Protection (2008-2014), and the Editor- in-Chief of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (2013-2015). He is currently the President of the Swiss National Committee of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) and a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society. Prof. Rachidi is an IEEE Fellow, EMP Fellow and Electromagnetics Academy Fellow.  Rachidi Model  This model, known as the Rachidi model, is extensively used in the literature for the evaluation of field-induced disturbances in transmission lines. Another remarkable endeavor of Prof. Rachidi is the instrumentation of the S√§ntis Tower in Switzerland for lightning current measurements. This project was initiated by Prof. Rachidi, Prof. M. Rubinstein and Prof. M. Paolone and resulted in the instrumentation of the tower for lightning current measurements. Since its instrumentation in 2010, several hundreds of lightning flashes have been successfully recorded on the tower and the station has served as a primary experimental site used by researchers and engineers involved in lightning research and protection. The obtained data constitute the largest dataset on lightning current and current derivatives associated with upward flashes available to this date. Other activities of Prof. Rachidi include the development of the so-called ‚Äòfull-wave‚Äô transmission line models (in cooperation with Dr. Sergei Tkachenko) and the use of the Electromagnetic Time Reversal (EMTR) technique to locating lightning discharges and faults in power networks (in cooperation of Prof. Marcos Rubinstein and Prof. Mario Paolone).  Publications  Farhad Rachidi is the author or coauthor of around 150 scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals, over 350 papers presented at international conferences, 3 books and more than 10 book chapters. One of his books (Electromagnetic Field Interaction with Transmission Lines. From Classical Theory to HF Radiation Effects) has been translated into Chinese and published by Tsinghua University Press.  Awards  In recognition of his outstanding research activities in the field of lightning. electromagnetics and EMC, he has received numerous awards, including the IEEE EMC Society Technical Achievement Award (2005), the CIGRE Technical Committee Award (2005), and the Blondel Medal from the French Association of Electrical Engineering, Electronics, Information Technology and Communication (2006). In 2014, Farhad Rachidi was conferred the title of Honorary Professor of the Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University in China. In October 2016 Farhad Rachidi-Haeri has received the prestigious Karl Berger Award for extraordinary theoretical and experimental achievements in lightning research. The Karl Berger Award is the highest distinction given by the International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP). It is given to scientisits for distinguished achievements in the science and engineering of lightning research, developing new fields in theory and practice, modelling and measurements. The conference was established in 1951 by a group of eminent scientists and is now considered to be the most prestigious scientific conference in the field of physics of lightning discharges and lightning protection.

Cross-cultural replication and evaluation of the Teaching Family Model of community-based residential treatment. Behavioral Residential Treatment. 1992;7(5):341‚Äì354.  History  From the 1870s, a number of charitable and poor-relief organizations in the United Kingdom who were involved in providing residential care for children began to make use of accommodation known as cottage homes. Rather than a single, large building which was then more typically used to house children in care, the cottage homes model placed them into family-style groups, typically of around 15-25 children. Each group lived in a 'cottage' (in reality, it was often a fair-sized house) under the care of an adult 'house mother' (or a married couple as 'house-parents'). The family group principle was originally developed at the Rauhes Haus in Germany and at the agricultural colony for young delinquents at Mettray in France. The first example of its use in the United Kingdom was the Home for Little Boys, at Farningham, opened in 1865. The cottage home developments constructed in the UK were often built in rural locations and in the style of a small village, with a number of the cottages arranged around a central green, or laid out as a village street. The sites usually included a school, infirmary, church, laundry, workshops, and sometimes a swimming bath. Around 115 Poor Law Unions in England and Wales set up cottage homes accommodation for children in their care. Children's Charities that used cottage homes included the National Children's Home (sites at Harpenden, Frodsham and Bramhope) and Barnardo's (sites at Barkingside and Woodford Bridge). It is estimated that, at their peak in the very early 1930s, there were beds for 15,000 children in cottage homes in England and Wales. From the time when they were built in the late nineteenth century up until 1950, it is thought that 175,000 children spent some or all of their childhoods in the cottage homes.Inside the Gates of Children's Cottage Homes, G Limbrick 2018 In 1967, the Teaching-family model was developed in the USA and used in juvenile justice. Boy‚Äôs Town, a residential child care community with campuses throughout North America, adapted and developed this model further.

The line ran south from Manchester Central to . The line was partially transferred to the ownership of the Cheshire Lines Committee in 1891, and remained in their ownership until nationalisation in 1948. From the beginning, the line carried both a regular local service between Manchester Central and Stockport Tiviot Dale (these were known as the South District trains), trains to , and long distance Midland Railway expresses to London, running via and . In 1892 the Fallowfield Loop Line was opened, from Chorlton to ; this had been built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) so that trains from their main line between Manchester and Sheffield, via Woodhead, could access Manchester Central Station. In 1901 the Midland Railway opened a new line between and New Mills via . The new line was built to provide a faster route to the south for express services, avoiding Stockport Tiviot Dale. From this date, many South District services ran to Cheadle Heath, which was provided as an interchange station so that passengers could transfer between long distance and local trains. Express services were using the new route by July 1902. Local passenger traffic on the line went into sharp decline in the 1950s and 60s, leading to the closure of Tiviot Dale station, and withdrawal of the local South District services in January 1967. Express trains continued to run until May 1969, when Manchester Central station was closed, after this, the line between Chorlton and Cheadle Heath was closed, and the track lifted in 1970. The route between Manchester and Chorlton which formed part of the Fallowfied Loop Line, continued in use by freight trains until 1989, when the track was lifted. =Partial reopening as a Metrolink line= Construction work to re-open the former British Rail line in 2011 Proposals to reopen the line for light rail use had been made in the 1980s,Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (1984). \\"Light Rapid Transit in Greater Manchester\\".

The Stockport‚ÄìStalybridge line as a proposed line of Metrolink =Stockport extension=2004 proposal An extension to the line from East Didsbury to Stockport was planned in 2004, and GMPTE applied for powers to build it. However, the process came to a halt when the big bang extension was stopped. The proposed extension would have reused some of the former railway alignment. However some of it was built on or filled in after closure, making re-opening more difficult, so the proposed line would have included some new infrastructure and street running sections to take it into Stockport. In these plans, the line would have terminated at Stockport bus station. Tram-train proposal Stockport MBC commissioned a study from the firm Atkins into the potential for the use of tram-trains on local railway lines in the area, which would be able to use both existing Metrolink lines, and existing heavy rail lines. The report, published in January 2015, proposed that the line from East Didsbury could be extended via a link to existing railway lines into both Stockport railway station, and to Hazel Grove railway station.

He was Minister for War from 1905 to 1907 and Chief of the General Staff from 1919 to 1922. Early life Tingsten was born on 13 July 1857 in Ingatorp, Sweden, the son of sergeant Lars Magnus Tingsten and his wife Maria Charlotta (n√©e Durling). He was the uncle of Herbert Tingsten. Tingsten passed studentexamen in Uppsala in 1875 and decided soon to pursue a military career, but at a time with petty military prejudices, it was only with great difficulty that the son of a noncommissioned officer son managed to be accepted as a volunteer officer. Career Tingsten was commissioned as an officer in H√§lsinge Regiment (I 14) in 1878 with then rank second lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1884 and he became lieutenant of the General Staff in 1886 and captain of the General Staff in 1891. Tingsten became major of the General Staff in 1897 and lieutenant colonel in 1901 after he served 1898-99 as major in Svea Life Guards (I 1). Tingsten had advanced within the General Staff where he belonged to the core group, which in the last decades of 1800s, seemed for the army's raise from decay and particularly for the implementation of conscription. Important was his work as a teacher of tactics at the Royal Military Academy in 1884, and well into the 1900s the cadets studied his seminal textbook on the subject. Tingsten was chief of staff of the 5th Army Division in 1895 and captain of S√∂dermanland Regiment (I 10) in 1896. In the years 1891-1900 he was first teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College and 1900-02 he was head of department at the Military Statistics Department before returning to the Royal Swedish Army Staff College as its head 1902-04. In 1904 he became a colonel and commander of Norrbotten Regiment (I 19). Early on, he was also used in work of defense policy and for this he was hired in the Riksdag committees appointed both in 1892 and 1901 as well as in numerous military committees. As such, he came in the opportunity to establish relationships with several prominent politicians, which undoubtedly contributed to that he in August 1905 succeeded Otto Virgin as Minister for War and head of the Ministry of Land Defence in Christian Lundeberg's coalition government. At his departure (7 November the same year) Tingsten remained in the same office in Karl Staaff first cabinet. On 16 May 1906 Tingsten filed along with Foreign Minister Eric Trolle his resignation, which is widely considered to be because of dissatisfaction with the speech that Prime Minister Karl Staaff held the previous day in Andra kammaren when dealing with suffrage. The ministerial crisis, which was triggered hereof, obtained on 29 May 1906, that Staff's ministry was replaced with a new one, with the Director General Arvid Lindman as Prime Minister, in which Tingsten came to remain as Minister for War. When Tingsten resigned he was succeeded by Olof Malm. Especially during the first period of Tingsten's time as Minister for War he managed to enforce some partial improvements in the defense system, including the completion of Boden Fortress and its commandant organization. In 1906 Tingsten was promoted to major general in the army and in 1907 he became commandant in Boden and commandant of Boden Fortress where the spent six years. Tingsten became commander of the 2nd Army Division in 1913 and Inspector of the Infantry in 1915 where he worked tirelessly and successfully for this branch continuous improvement according to the experience of World War I. Thus he acquired in the army's officer corps the honorary title of \\"General of the Infantry\\". As Inspector of the Infantry he published Infantry Training Regulations (Infanteriets utbildningsf√∂reskrifter, 1917) and Infantry training in drill (Infanteriets utbildning i exercis, 1918), and he changed or published several instructions regarding the infantry and machine guns. In addition, he wrote a large number of essays in military journals, especially in journal of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences (1884-1924), mainly about infantry organization and tactics. As Chief of the General Staff from 1919, he met a neither easy or rewarding task, due to the postwar general indifference of the Swedish defense. Other work Tingsten was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences from 1891. He was a civil law notary in the Committee on Defence in 1892, secretary in the Committee on Defence in 1900, secretary in the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences from 1900 to 1903, chairman of the Committee for the reorganization of Field Medical Corps in 1908, member of several military committees, chairman of the Passage System Committee in 1912, chairman of experts to revise the infantry exercise regulations from 1914 to 1915, chairman of experts to draw up instructions for fortified positions in 1917 and chairman in the equipment committee in 1922. Later life When Tingsten retired from active duty in 1922, he could, with an energy that wasn't hindered by old age ailments, pursue his extensive war scientific and military history writing. He became an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy at Uppsala University in 1927. Personal life Solna cemetery. In 1883 he was married Amy Forssell (1855‚Äì1943).

The prints have an important documentary value by providing a record of the impact of the bombardment.V√©ronique Van de Kerckhof, 'Le peintre et l'arpenteur: images de Bruxelles et de l'ancien duch√© de Brabant', Renaissance Du Livre, 2000, p. 71 Seven further plates from Coppens' drawings were engraved by the Brussels engraver Jan Lauwryn Krafft and published in 1715.Edmund de Busscher, 'Augustin Coppens' at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 4, pp. 379‚Äì380 A portrait painting of Coppens showing him standing with a paper roll and his brushes before a landscape with the ruins of Brussels was for a long time regarded as his self-portrait but is now believed to be by an unknown hand. The fish kay Augustin Coppens joined the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1698 when he was already 30 years old. By his account he had already commenced designing tapestries and cartoons before he joined the Guild. He was very productive as a tapestry designer working on commissions from workshops in Brussels, Antwerp and Oudenaarde. Works=General= Augustin Coppens specialized in city views, landscapes and portraits. He worked in various mediums including painting, etching, drawing and tapestry design. Only one portrait painting is currently attributed to Coppens, a Portrait of Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria (1695, Museum of the City of Brussels). Coppens is mainly known for his tapestry designs and for his drawings and prints documenting the devastating effect on the civil buildings caused by the Bombardment of Brussels by French troops. =Tapestry= Coppens worked as a designer of many tapestry series for workshops in the leading tapestry manufacturing centers in Flanders. He typically collaborated on these designs with specialist history painters. Coppens would take responsibility for the landscapes in the cartoon designs. He worked with many of the leading tapestry designers of his time including Victor Honor√© Janssens, Jan van Orley, Lodewijk van Schoor and Zeger Jacob van Helmont. Resting Diana, from the Triumph of the Gods In the early 1700s Coppens and Jan van Orley became the leading team of tapestry designers for the Reydams Leyniers tapestry workshop in Brussels. Coppens and Jan van Orley created a neo-Baroque style for the Brussels workshops. In their works of the early 1700s, Coppens and van Orley created mythological, romance, and genre scenes which were of a lighter spirit and tone than before. They contributed to the early 18th century move in the Brussels workshops towards more playful forms, away from the severe Baroque historical and mythological subjects and towards a lighter R√©gence style. This involved a more relaxed narrative in the tapestries and sometimes the loose compilation of associated subjects, chosen according to a client's request. This development is apparent in the series on The Triumphs of the Gods on which Coppens collaborated with Victor Honor√© Janssens for the workshop of Judocus de Vos.A Flemish tapestry depicting 'The Triumph of Bacchus,' from a series of the Triumphs of the Gods, woven in the workshop of Judocus de Vos (1661/62-1734), after designs attributed to Victor Janssens (1658-1736) and Augustin Coppens (1668-1740) circa 1705, Brussels at Sotheby's Coppens contributed on another series on the same theme with Jan van Orley for the Leyniers workshop. In these tapestries Coppens showed his sophisticated use of colours with the greens and browns of the foreground merging into shades of yellow and blue.Guy Delmarcel, Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1 January 1999, p. 522 ReferencesExternal links Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish tapestry artists Category:Artists from Brussels Category:Members of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke Category:1668 births Category:1740 deaths ","title":"Augustin Coppens"},{"id":"49238877","text":"Oliver Nicola Hegi (born February 20, 1993) is a Swiss male artistic gymnast and a member of the national team.

ULT is the abbreviation for ultra low temperature. There are upright and chest freezers. The inner volume is in general between 300 and 800 L. Refrigeration cycle A two-cycle cascade refrigeration process schematic diagram ULT freezers that employ the cascade refrigeration (CR) system use up to 20 times the energy footprint of household fridges, and used to refrigerate with greenhouse gas fluids (typically hydrofluorocarbon R-508B).Modern ULT freezers employ HC gas mixtures. Typically Ethane and Propane. This has also improved their efficiency by up 30% over the conventional CFC or HFC gassed freezers.  Application  In contrast to short term sample storage at +4 ¬∞C or -20 ¬∞C by using standard refrigerators or freezers, many molecular biology or life science laboratories need long term storage for biological samples like DNA, RNA, proteins, cell extracts, or reagents. To reduce the risk of sample damage, these types of samples need extremely low temperatures of -80 to -86 ¬∞C. Cells are stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen at -196 ¬∞C. Cryogenic chest freezers can achieve temperatures of down to ‚àí150C, and may include a liquid nitrogen backup. The samples in ULT freezers are typically stored in polymer tubes or microtubes. Typically, a rectangular grid of 64, 81 or 100 of these microtubes are located in one box made of cardboard or polymer. Standard ULT freezers can store ca. 350 to 450 of those standard boxes for microtubes.  Sample location  When using an ULT freezer at full capacity, 40,000 or 50,000 microtubes are stored in one instrument. Clear sample labeling (type of sample, concentration, volume, owner, date, etc.) and exact documentation of the sample location within the freezer is mandatory to find the sample tubes.  Pull down time  The pull down time is defined as the necessary time to cool down the ULT freezer from ambient temperatures to the selected temperature of -80 to -86 ¬∞C. The time strongly depends on the type of insulation, the efficiency of the compressor system as well as the installed metal shelves within the freezer. At the start of the 21st century, ULT freezers were able to cool down within 3 to 5 hours. Warm up time is typically 1/8 degC per minute.  Energy consumption  Due to the low temperature, ULT freezer consume high amounts of electric energy per day. Depending on the volume of the freezer, the opening frequency of the users as well as the number of samples, the energy consumption starts from ca. 11 kWh/ day and higher. To reduce the energy consumption, the insulation should be as efficient as possible. Additional inner doors reduce the loss of temperature when opening the main door. Icing within the ULT freezer should be reduced to a minimum. Modern ULT freezers employ variable speed drives for both the compressors and fans. This has reduced energy consumption a further 30% to typically 8.5 kWh/day.

May Henrietta Mukle FRAM (14 May 1880 ‚Äì 20 February 1963) was a British cellist and composer. She has been described as a \\"noted feminist cellist\\", who encouraged other women cellists.  Early life  Mukle was born in London, the daughter of Leopold Mukle. Her father was an immigrant from Hungary, trained as a clockmaker, but best known as an organ builder in London, part of the partnership Imhof & Mukle. Her sisters Anne and Lillian were also musicians. She studied cello at the Royal Academy of Music with .  Career  Mukle was a working musician for over fifty years, including concert tours in Australia, Africa, and Asia. Her instrument was built by Montagnana and bought for her by an anonymous donor. Mukle was also a composer of works for cello and piano. She performed as a soloist, and in chamber ensembles. She was a member of the all-women English Ensemble, with violinist Marjorie Hayward, violist Rebecca Clarke, and pianist Kathleen Long. In 1925, Mukle played at New York's Aeolian Hall with Percy Grainger and Lionel Tertis. With her pianist sister, Anne Mukle, she was a member of the Maud Powell Trio. Also with Anne, she gave the first performance of Ralph Vaughan Williams' Six Studies in English Folk Song in London in 1926. Mukle's apartment near Wigmore Hall was convenient for hosting visiting musicians; she also convinced the landlords to rent other apartments to musicians, so there would be fewer conflicts about noise. She founded the Mainly Musicians Club in a basement in London; during World War II, she converted it into a air raid shelter. She was an original member of the Society of Women Musicians, present at the organization's first meeting in 1911. Mukle was described in The Times as \\"in the very front rank of living violoncellists\\", and her obituary in The Times says of her: \\"by the turn of the century she was fully recognized not only as an outstanding musician but as one of the most remarkable cellists this country had produced.\\"  Personal life and legacy  Mukle broke her wrist in a car accident in 1959, at age 79, but resumed playing after it healed, performing in North Carolina in 1960. She died at Cuckfield, Sussex, in 1963, at the age of 82. Her portrait, painted by John Mansfield Crealock, is held in the museum of the Royal Academy of Music.

For the next five years, they tried selling Superman to various newspaper syndicates, with no success. In 1935, Siegel and Shuster began working for New York comic magazine publisher National Allied Publications, producing detective and adventure stories. They refused, however, to sell Superman, their prize creation, to National Allied because it was a poorly-managed business.Jerome Siegel, in a sworn affidavit signed 1 March 1973, filed in Jerome Siegel & Joseph Shuster vs National Periodical Publications et al, 69 Civ 1429: \\"In 1935 Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, a publisher of comic books, expressed interest in Superman and tried to persuade us that the property would be more successful if published in comic book form where it would be seen in color, than it would be in a black and white daily strip.

(an affiliate of National Allied Publications) that gave Detective Comics, Inc. the right of first refusal over any comic material they produced for the next two years, and stipulated a pay rate of $10 per page. In January 1938, Detective Comics, Inc. offered to publish Superman. Siegel and Shuster by now had given up on the newspapers and agreed to sell Superman to Detective Comics, Inc.

Originally submitted as an exhibit in Jerome Siegel and Joseph Shuster vs. National Comics Publications Inc. et al. (New York Supreme Court 1947) On September 22, 1938, Siegel and Shuster signed a 10-year contract with Detective Comics wherein they agreed to give Detective right of first refusal with a duration of six weeks over any comics stories they created for the next five years. On December 19, 1939, Siegel and Shuster signed a contract which increased their pay rate to $20 per page and promised them 5% of net proceeds from any commercial exploitation of Superman beyond magazines, books, and newspapers.Judge J. Addison Young's findings of facts, April 12, 1948: \\"On December 19, 1939, a modification agreement (Pl. Ex. 22), was entered into between plaintiffs and DETECTIVE COMICS, INC. by which plaintiffs' compensation for SUPERMAN magazine releases was increased to $20. per page, and in addition DETECTIVE COMICS, INC. agreed to pay to plaintiffs 5% of the net proceeds to be derived from commercial exploitation of SUPERMAN other than from magazine and book publication and newspaper syndication.\\" In November 1938, Siegel proposed to Detective Comics that he do stories of Superman's childhood adventures, with the character calling himself \\"Superboy\\". Detective rejected Siegel's pitch. In December 1940, Siegel pitched the idea again with a complete script for the first story, but Detective did not respond within the contractual six weeks. Siegel served in the US Army from June 1943 to January 1946,Summary of Jerome Siegel's service record, via the National Personnel Records Center and spent most of his service in Hawaii.

The story was partially based on the script Siegel had submitted in 1940, and was illustrated by Shuster.: \\"So when the first official Superboy adventure was published in More Fun Comics #101, the first portion of the story is Jerry‚Äôs script with Joe (and the shop) providing art. But then, abruptly, the tone changes as writer Don Cameron is brought in to finish the rest.\\" Detective had done this without informing Siegel; he learned about it in a letter from Shuster. 1947‚Äì1948: Siegel and Shuster sue for ownership of Superman and Superboy In 1947, Siegel and Shuster sued National Comics Publications for the rights to both Superman and Superboy and a \\"just share\\" of all profits that National and its partners made off the character. The suit was filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in Westchester County.Jerome Siegel and Joseph Shuster vs. National Comics Publications Inc. et al (New York Supreme Court 1947) The case was presided over by Judge J. Addison Young. =Regarding the ownership of Superman= Siegel and Shuster argued that the March 1, 1938 contract in which they sold Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. should be voided because it lacked sufficient consideration for Siegel and Shuster. Judge Young ruled that the $130 mentioned in the contract was not payment for the copyright to Superman but their wages for the thirteen pages of Superman stories they made for Action Comics #1. Young referred to their December 4, 1937 employment contract, which gave Detective Comics, Inc. the right of first refusal over any comic magazine material Siegel and Shuster produced, and which stipulated a pay rate of $10 per page. The $130 mentioned in the March 1, 1938 contract was therefore a superfluous assessment of their wages which were already owed, and not payment for the copyright to Superman. Judge Young concluded that the consideration that Siegel and Shuster had effectively bargained for was simply to see Superman published. Siegel and Shuster also argued that the March 1938 contract lacked mutuality, saying that at the time Superman was an idea not fully developed and thus there was no clear concept on what was being sold. Judge Young disagreed, and concluded that the strips that appeared in Action Comics #1 were based on a fully developed concept that Siegel and Shuster submitted before March 1938, and this is what Detective Comics, Inc. had purchased in the contract. On April 12, 1948, Young declared that Superman belonged to National.Judge J. Addison Young, in his April 12, 1948 interlocutory judgment. =Regarding the ownership of Superboy= National argued that Superboy was a work made for hire, but Judge Young rejected this argument because Detective Comics, Inc., on both occasions Siegel proposed his idea, had not indicated within six weeks of submission that it wished to publish Superboy, thereby effectively refusing it under the terms of their September 1938 contract. National argued that Superboy was a derivative work of Superman, but Young ruled that Superboy was a separate entity. On April 12, 1948, Young ruled that Siegel was \\"the originator and the sole owner\\" of Superboy, and ordered National to account for the proceeds it made of Superboy and to cease publishing Superboy stories. =Regarding unpaid royalties= Siegel and Shuster argued that National had cheated them of their royalties from the radio adaptation of Superman and merchandising. Their December 1939 contract entitled them to 5% of the net proceeds from all commercial exploitation of Superman beyond books, magazines, and newspapers. They argued that National had understated the proceeds and did not allow Siegel and Shuster access to the accounting records. Judge Young agreed that there were irregularities and decided an official accounting of all proceeds made from Superman was appropriate. =Conclusion= Judge Young concluded, in April 1948, that National owned Superman but Siegel owned Superboy. He ordered National to account before the court all proceeds made from Superman and Superboy. The parties instead chose to settle out-of-court. National paid Siegel and Shuster $94,013.16 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for the rights to both Superman and Superboy. On May 21, 1948, Young entered a final judgment which vacated his April judgment, and ruled that the copyrights to Superman and Superboy belonged to National Comics Publications, Inc.: 1965‚Äì1974: Copyright-renewal applications and lawsuit Under the Copyright Act of 1909, a copyright lasted 28 years. Near the end of this term, the author(s) could apply to have the copyright renewed for another 28 years, which was an opportunity for Siegel and Shuster to regain the rights to Superman. In April 1965, Siegel and Shuster applied to renew the copyright of Superman, and that June, National Periodical Publications filed its own renewal application. National kept publishing Superman stories and licensing Superman merchandise after April 18, 1966, the date the initial 28-year term ended. In 1969, Siegel and Shuster sued National Periodical Publications in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York over ownership of Superman.Jerome Siegel and Joe Shuster v. National Periodical Publications, Inc., Case No. 69 Civ 1429 (USDC SDNY 1969) The court found that in the 1947 final consent judgment, Siegel and Shuster had transferred \\"all their rights\\" to the Superman character to National, including the renewal term. This decision was based on the legal precedent set by Fred Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark & Sons, in which the US Supreme Court ruled that an author could in writing convey his renewal rights in advance of their vesting. The court also ruled that Superman was a work made for hire, despite the fact that Siegel and Shuster had been developing the character long before they began employment at National. The court argued that Detective Comics had rejected Siegel and Shuster's earlier prototype of Superman and that the revised version that appeared in Action Comics #1 was made under the supervision of Detective Comics. =Siegel and Shuster appeal to the Second Circuit= Siegel and Shuster appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Jerome Siegel and Joseph Shuster, v. National Periodical Publications, Inc., et al., 508 F.2d 909 (2d Cir. 1974) The appeals court disagreed with the lower court's decision that Superman was a work made for hire. Nevertheless, they agreed that Siegel and Shuster had indeed transferred their renewal rights and thus were not entitled to the copyright for Superman. 1975: Public relations campaign for comics creators In 1975, Warner Bros. announced the production of a Superman movie to be directed by Richard Donner. Siegel publicly condemned the project and drew attention to his poverty and the apathy of DC Comics. He found sympathizers such as Neal Adams and Jerry Robinson, who waged a public relations campaign for better treatment of comic creators in general. In order to avoid bad press, Warner Bros. agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman stories, in exchange for no longer contesting ownership of Superman.: \\"In exchange, Siegel and Shuster once again acknowledged that DC Comics was the exclusive owner of all rights and title to Superman.\\" The stipend was initially $20,000Paragraph (5)(a) of the 1975 agreement: \\"Warner will make monthly payments to each of you at the annual rate of $20,000 for your respective lifetimes, less any applicable withholding taxes, commencing January 1, 1976.\\" but rose over the years. 1992: Shuster dies Shuster died on July 30, 1992, and he willed control of his estate to his sister, Jean Shuster Peavy. On October 2, 1992, Jean Peavy and Frank Shuster (Joe Shuster's brother)Not to be confused with Frank Shuster the comedian and Joe Shuster's cousin. writes that the brother died in 1996 whereas the cousin died in 2002. signed an agreement with DC Comics wherein they re-granted DC all of Joe Shuster's rights in exchange for a $25,000 annual stipend. The agreement read: In a 2010 lawsuit (see below), DC Comics claimed it and its affiliates had paid Shuster's heirs \\"close to $500,000\\" under this agreement.In paragraph 51 in the complaint filed by DC Comics on May 14, 2010. 1996: Siegel dies Jerry Siegel, his wife Joanne, and daughter Laura (1976) When Siegel died on January 28, 1996, his estate passed to his widow Joanne Siegel, son Michael Siegel, and daughter Laura Siegel Larson, who held respectively 25%, 12.5%, and 12.5% of the interest in Superman.This is noted in the complaint filed by DC Comics in its 2010 lawsuit against the Shuster heirs. The Copyright Act of 1976 contained a provision which allowed for a creator to terminate their grant of the copyright to their work 56 years after the date the copyright was first secured. The creator would then have a five- year window to do so.Copyright Act of 1976, ¬ß 304(c)(3) The creator, however, would have to serve a notice of termination in advance of the effective date; between two and ten years in advance.Copyright Act of 1976, ¬ß 304(c)(4)(A) Action Comics #1 was published on April 18, 1938. Consequently, Superman's copyright would become eligible for termination beginning April 18, 1994 and ending April 18, 1999, and the termination notices had to be served between April 18, 1984, and April 18, 1997. Likewise, Superboy's copyright became eligible for termination between December 2000 and December 2005, and the notices had to be served sometime between and December 1990 and December 2003. Siegel never applied for termination, but his heirs did after his death. On April 3, 1997, Joanne Siegel and Laura Siegel Larson served DC Comics a termination notice for Superman which became effective on April 16, 1999. The Siegel heirs now owned 50% of Superman, the other half remaining with DC Comics. Warner Brothers attempted to negotiate an agreement with Siegel's heirs in order to retain Siegel's half of the rights to Superman. On October 16, 2001, Warner made an offer. Warner offered a payment of $3 million, an annual stipend of $500,000, a 6% royalty of Superman and a 1% royalty of his publications, and full medical benefits. Warner also agreed to insert the line \\"By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family\\" in all future Superman productions.: \\"DC eventually returned with an offer whereby the Siegels would surrender their portion of the copyright for a payday of $2 million, another million in advance, and a minimum annual sum of $500,000. In addition, the Siegels would get a 6 percent royalty of Superman and a 1 percent royalty of his publications. Jerry and Joe would keep their credits, and the families would get full medical benefits. The Siegels accepted the offer on October 16, 2001, one day before what would have been Jerry‚Äôs eighty-seventh birthday.\\" The Siegel heirs accepted this offer in an October 19 letter released by their lawyer, Kevin Marks. Marc Toberoff's offer to the Siegel and Shuster heirs In 2001, Jean Peavy's son and Joe Shuster's nephew, Mark Warren Peary, contacted attorney and movie producer Marc Toberoff. On November 23, Peavy and Peary entered into a joint venture with Toberoff's production firm, Pacific Pictures.According to , Peary said this in a 2011 deposition to lawyers representing Warner Bros. the corporate owner of DC Comics.From a motion filed on August 13, 2010 by one of Toberoff's attorneys in the 2010 lawsuit (Document 30, 2:10-cv-03633): \\"In mid-2001, Joseph Shuster‚Äôs nephew, Mark Warren Peary (‚ÄúPeary‚Äù), after researching copyright issues on the internet, sought out attorney Marc Toberoff in connection with the potential termination of Joseph Shuster‚Äôs copyright grants.\\" Toberoff then contacted the Siegel heirs, first through a phone call to their lawyer, Kevin Marks, on November 29, 2001. In negotiations the following year, Toberoff and his colleague Ari Emanuel offered the Siegel heirs $15 million for their half of rights to Superman. Toberoff's plan was to eventually produce a Superman movie after securing the rights to Superman from Siegel and Shuster's heirs. On September 21, 2002, the Siegel heirs fired Marks and later replaced him with Toberoff. On September 30, the Siegel heirs sent a letter to DC Comics stating that the negotiations were over. On November 8, 2002, Siegel's heirs filed termination notices for the Superboy character and claimed full ownership of the character. This termination would have taken effect on November 17, 2004. On August 27, 2004, DC Comics denied the notices. The Siegels then took DC Comics to court. Under the terms of the Copyright Act of 1976 in its original form, only the spouse, children, or grandchildren of a dead author could terminate a grant of copyright. This had prevented Shuster's sister and nephew from terminating Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman in the years following his death. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act modified the law to allow executors of estates to terminate.The Copyright Term Extension Act: Sections 203(a)(2) and 304(c)(2) of title 17, United States Code. Under the original law, the window to serve the termination notice had ended in 1997, but the Sonny Bono Act also added a new subsection allowing the Shuster heirs to terminate 75 to 80 years after the copyright was first secured (with the usual two- to ten-year advance notice).17 U.S.C. ¬ß 304(d) The Shuster heirs could terminate their grant between 2013 and 2018, and the termination notice would have to be served between 2003 and 2016. On November 7, 2003, Peary served DC Comics with a notice of termination of Shuster's grant of the rights to Superman. He assigned Shuster's half of the rights to Superman to Pacific Pictures. 2004‚Äì2016: Siegel's heirs sue  On October 8, 2004, Siegel's heirs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California to assert their claim they owned 50% of the copyright of Superman (the other half being Shuster's).Laura Siegel Larson et al. v. Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. et al., Case No. CV 04-8400 (USDC CDCA 2004) On October 22, 2004, Siegel heirs filed another lawsuit in the same court over the rights to Superboy.Laura Siegel Larson et al. v. Time Warner, Inc. et al., Case No. CV 04-8776 (USDC CDCA 2004) They claimed 100% ownership of the Superboy character, as it was solely the creation of Siegel.In the complaint filed on October 22, 2004: \\"As the sole creator and author of \\"Superboy\\", Jerome Siegel owned all rights in \\"Superboy\\", including the copyrights to \\"Superboy\\" prior to the alleged transfer or assignment of \\"Superboy\\" pursuant to the 1948 Stipluation.\\" Marc Toberoff represented the Siegels in both cases. The cases were assigned to Judge Ronald S.W. Lew on September 21, 2005. The following year, Lew took senior status and the cases were eventually reassigned to Judge Stephen G. Larson on October 30, 2006.From a Joint Status Report filed on December 21, 2009. Document 184, page 20. In Joanne Siegel et al v. Time Warner Inc et al 2:04-cv-08776-ODW-RZ In November 2009, Larson recused himself and the cases were reassigned to Judge Otis D. Wright II.From court records obtained via pacer.gov. Joanne Siegel died on February 12, 2011, before the cases were resolved. Her daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, took over the cases and became executor of the Siegel estate. =Regarding Superman= DC Comics argued that the October 19, 2001 letter from the Siegels constituted a binding acceptance of DC's offer for the rights to Superman. However, Judge Larson found that the parties kept changing the terms of the agreement in subsequent correspondence, and thus never came to a stable agreement that the courts could enforce. Larson ruled that the Siegel heirs had regained half of the rights to Action Comics #1. In an August 12, 2009 supplement, Larson further elaborated his ruling. =Regarding Superboy= DC Comics argued that Superboy was a work made for hire and thus DC owned the character from conception; that Superboy was a derivative work of Superman and thus Siegel had no right to it because DC owned Superman; and that Superboy was a joint work between Siegel and Shuster and thus Siegel's heirs lacked the majority interest required to terminate.These arguments were cited by Judge Lew in his March 23, 2006 ruling. On March 23, 2006, Judge Lew concluded that, in the 1947-48 lawsuit (see above), Judge Young already addressed and rejected these arguments and that res judicata and collateral estoppel precluded re- litigation. Lew ruled that the Siegel heirs had effectively terminated Siegel's grant of the rights to Superboy. He also ruled that the protagonist of the television show Smallville was Superboy. After Judge Larson took over the case in October 2006, DC Comics moved for reconsideration of Lew's decision, and on July 27, 2007, Larson vacated Lew's ruling regarding the terminations of DC's Superboy right. =DC Comics appeals to the Ninth Circuit= DC Comics appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Larson v. Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., Case Nos. 11-55863, 11-56034 (9th Cir. 2012) Arguments were held on November 5, 2012. The court reversed the District Court's grant of summary judgment, ruling that the October 19, 2001 letter from the Siegels (see above) constituted a legally binding acceptance of the October 16 oral agreement with DC Comics.\\"We hold, as a matter of law, that the October 19, 2001, letter did constitute such an acceptance.\\" The court ruled that, even though the agreement had not been finalized, the terms were \\"sufficiently definite that a court could enforce them\\". In a January 2013 memorandum, the presiding judges wrote: The appeals court remanded the case back to the District Court. In an April 18, 2013 judgment, Judge Wright denied all of the Siegel heirs' claims and ruled that the October 19, 2001 letter irrevocably gave DC Comics the rights to Superman and Superboy. =Larson appeals to the Ninth Circuit= Laura Siegel Larson appealed Wright's April 2013 judgment to the Ninth Circuit. Larson argued that the October 2001 letter did not transfer the rights to Superboy because at the time of its writing the Siegel heirs had not yet terminated DC Comics' rights to Superboy. The appeals court rejected this argument. Larson claimed that her mother Joanne had rescinded the October 2001 letter and that DC Comics agreed to her decision. This was the first time that Larson raised this argument, and the appeals court refused to consider it because doing so would prejudice DC by forcing them to rework their defense from scratch. =Effects of these cases= The television show Legion of Super Heroes, which aired from 2006 to 2008, was originally meant to be titled Superboy and the Legion of Superheroes, but because this ongoing lawsuit left the ownership of Superboy in doubt, Warner Bros. Animation changed the title and replaced the character of Superboy with Superman (although he remained a teenager).In a footnote in . 2010‚Äì2013: DC sues the Shuster heirs In 2010, DC Comics sued Toberoff, Joanne Siegel, Laura Siegel Larson, and Mark Warren Peary. Jean Peavy, incapacitated by a stroke in 2009, was not listed as a defendant in this case. Her son, Mark Warren Peary, was substitute executor for the Shuster estate. DC asked the court to invalidate and void the Shusters' termination notice and the agreements between Toberoff's firms and the heirs of Siegel and Shuster. The lawsuit was filed with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and the case assigned to Judge Otis D. Wright II.DC Comics v. Pacific Pictures Corp. et al, Case No. CV 10-3633 ODW (RZx) (USDC C.D. Cal. 2010) The judge agreed with DC's argument that the 1992 agreement with Jean Peavy, the sole heir and executor to Shuster's estate, barred her and all other heirs from pursuing termination. The judge also ruled that the 1992 agreement superseded all prior agreements between Shuster and DC Comics, and as a post-1978 grant it is not subject to termination under ¬ß 304(d) of US copyright law.\\"In sum, the Court finds that the 1992 Agreement, which represented the Shuster heirs‚Äô opportunity to renegotiate the prior grants of Joe Shuster‚Äôs copyrights, superseded and replaced all prior grants of the Superman copyrights. The 1992 Agreement thus represents the parties‚Äô operative agreement and, as a post-1978 grant, it is not subject to termination under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 304(d).\\" The judge also ruled that the transfer of rights to Pacific Pictures was illegal because it had been made before the effective date of termination of October 26, 2013.\\"Defendants do not dispute that they entered into multiple agreements purporting to grant and otherwise encumber rights covered by a (to be) terminated grant; indeed, they agree that those agreements are void insofar as they aim to transfer the subject copyrights. (See Opp‚Äôn at 18.) Those agreements run afoul of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 304(c)(6)(D) as well and, accordingly, are hereby deemed invalid.\\" The Shuster heirs appealed to the Ninth Circuit, but the appeals court agreed with Wright's judgment. Future The copyright to Action Comics #1 was in its renewal term on October 27, 1998 (the date the Copyright Term Extension Act became effective). This means that the copyright will expire 95 years after it was first secured,See 17 USC ¬ß 304(b) i.e. in 2033. Thus, barring new legislation, Superman as he is depicted in Action Comics #1 will become public domain in 2033, along with other story elements such as Lois Lane and the city of Metropolis. Some later developments of the character, such as his power of \\"heat vision\\" (introduced in a 1949 story), may not be available to unlicensed authors as they were introduced in works that will persist longer under copyright. Supporting characters such as Lana Lang, or locales such as the Fortress of Solitude, will also persist for longer in copyright.

It is preserved in Flateyjarb√≥k, a saga collection that was written at the end of the 14th century. Olaf Geirstad Alf, who is also one of the kings who appear in the poem Ynglingatal, is said to have been king of Vestfold or Grenland in Norway in the late 9th century.  Content  \\"√û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs\\" consists of four short chapters. The first is about Olaf's family background and the farm of Geirstad where he reportedly lived. A verse from Ynglingatal is also reproduced here.\\"√û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs\\", ch. 1. The second chapter is about Olaf's dream. The author recounts that Olaf called a thing on his farm to tell people about a dream he had had, in which a black bull that came through the country, killing a lot of people, and at last it killed Olaf's hird. Olaf thought that this dream was a warning of disease and famine coming. He therefore asked the people at the thing to make a great mound, where they could bury him after his death. Everything happened as Olaf had said: sickness and mass death happened, and his hird died and finally himself, and he was buried in a mound on Geirstad.\\"√û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs\\", ch. 2. The rest of the √æ√°ttr is about a man named Hrani, a foster brother of Harald Grenske, who was the father of St. Olaf. The events are supposed to have happened during the reign of Olaf Tryggvasson (ca. 995‚Äì1000). Hrani had a dream where Olaf Geirstad-Alf came to him and told him that he should break into the mound and find a sword, a belt and a ring; he should bring these to a farm in Grenland in Viken, where Harald Grenske's wife, √Östa Gudbrandsdatter, was giving birth. Hrani was told that he should put the belt on √Östa to ease her labour. The sword and ring he should give to the newborn boy, and he should name him Olaf after Olaf Geirstad- Alf.\\"√û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs\\", ch. 3. The last chapter is about how Hrani carried out the instructions he had received in the dream: he broke into the mound, took out the three objects and went to the farm where his foster brother Harald and √Östa lived. When Hrani laid the belt on Asta, the child was delivered. This boy later became Saint Olaf.\\"√û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs\\", ch. 4.  References  Sources  * √û√°ttr √ìlafs Geirsta√∞a Alfs.

He lost the title to Thompson the following year, on April 14, 1931. Remarkably, the majority of his recorded wins were by knockout, and his losses were few, at under ten percent of his total fights. He was rated by The Ring magazine as a Top Ten Welterweight contender from 1926-1931. His impressive win and extraordinary knockout record might be explained by the limited quality of competition he faced in Hot Springs where he fought many of his fights. Boxing career highlights Freeman's amateur boxing career began around the age of sixteen in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Between 1920-22, he lost only two of twenty of his better publicized local bouts and won six by knockout. He fought most of these bouts in the lightweight to super-lightweight division. Around 1923, at 19, he began fighting in the Welterweight division, and often out of state in Memphis, Tennessee, and parts of New Orleans. His few losses during this period were often to heavier or more experienced boxers, and included Al Monroe, Dude Martinez, and Frankie Jones. His loss to Jimmy King in January 1923 was a rare TKO, in which Freeman sprained his hip and was very reluctant to have his manager call the fight. He achieved some early recognition on New Years Day in 1926, when he knocked out Sergeant Sammy Baker in seven rounds at Madison Square Garden.\\"Tommy Freeman Kayoes Sam Baker\\", Milwaukee Sentinel, pg. 49, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2 January 1926. On October 25, 1926, Freeman fought a well attended match against Jack Zivic of Pittsburgh in Cleveland, Ohio. Both fighters were recognized as leading contenders for the Welterweight title then held by Pete Latzo. The bout was a thrilling spectacle and the substantial crowd of twelve thousand loudly opposed the draw verdict as they favored the local boxer Zivic.\\"Jack Zivic Boxes Ten-round Draw with Tommy Freeman in Fast Bout at Cleveland\\", Pittsburgh Gazette Times, pg. 13, Pittsburgh, PA, 26 October 1926. On June 22, 1926, Freeman defeated Pinky Mitchell in Brooklyn, Ohio, in ten rounds by Newspaper Decision of the Associated Press. Mitchell had held the Light Welterweight (Super Lightweight) Championship from 1922-26 when he was defeated by Mushy Callahan. On August 18, 1927, Freeman beat noted British boxer Harry Mason in a ten round welterweight bout at Madison Square Garden. Mason had a neat right-hand that countered Freeman, but he could not match him in close quarters. Mason was well known in London where he had taken the British Lightweight Championship, known as the Lonsdale Belt in February 1926. Mason, a Jewish boxer, had been a stablemate of Jewish welterweight champion Jack \\"Kid\\" Berg under trainer Alec Goodman.\\"British Boxers Loses to Tommy Freeman\\", Ottawa Citizen, pg. 6, Ottawa, Canada, 19 August 1927.Harding, John, Jack Berg: The Whitechapel Windmill, (1987) Robson Books, Ltd., London, UK, pg.82 Freeman defeated Jewish welterweight contender Georgie Levine in a ten round points decision on October 14, 1929 at Motor Square Garden in Pittsburgh. Now a rising star, Freeman boxed elegantly conserving his energy to last the full ten rounds, and slipped most of the punches of Levine while landing his own with accuracy. He appeared to fight without dealing unnecessary punishment to Levine, whom he easily outpointed.Jab, Jim, \\"Freeman is Victor Over George Levine\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 40, 15 October 1929 =Taking world welterweight championship, September 1930= On September 5, 1930, at Cleveland Ball Park in Cleveland, Ohio, Freeman defeated Young Jack Thompson, the reigning Welterweight Champion in front of a crowd of 16,000. The well- known and widely respected referee Patsy Haley, a former New York boxer, crowned Freeman the winner after fifteen rounds of close fighting, shocking the crowd as well as both boxers. In the second round, Thompson had floored Freeman for a count of six. According to the referee, the victory was given to Freeman based largely on his performance in the last three rounds when he connected with far more punches than Thompson. The championship bout was Thompson's first title defense.Dunkley, Charles W., \\"Tommy Freeman is Crowned New King of Welterweights\\", Montreal Gazette, pg. 15, New London, CT, 6 September 1930. Losing the world welterweight championship, April, 1931 Freeman held the title until his rematch with Jack Thompson on April 14, 1931 again in Cleveland where he lost by TKO in the tenth of fifteen rounds. The bout was stopped due to Freeman's badly battered left eye. He had a long career as a boxer, and remained fighting as a super welterweight until around 1937. He fought for a year as a middleweight from 1937-8. Best known of his middleweight opponents was Al McCoy who he fought on July 2 and 16, 1937, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. He died on February 20, 1986 in Little Rock, Arkansas at 82, an advanced age for a lifelong boxer.

It is a form of network-attached storage (NAS). Storage in such is organised as blocks. This emulates the type of behaviour seen in traditional disk or tape storage. Blocks are identified by an arbitrary and assigned identifier by which they may be stored and retrieved, but this has no obvious meaning in terms of files or documents. A filesystem must be applied on top of the block-level storage to map 'files' onto a sequence of blocks. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is an example of a cloud block store. Cloud block-level storage will usually offer facilities such as replication for reliability, or backup services. Block-level storage is in contrast to an object store or 'bucket store', such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), or to a database. These operate at a higher level of abstraction and are able to work with entities such as files, documents, images, videos or database records. Instance stores are another form of cloud-hosted block-level storage. These are provided as part of an 'instance', such as an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service. As EC2 instances are primarily provided as compute resources, rather than storage resources, their storage is less robust. Their contents will be lost if the cloud instance is stopped. As these stores are part of the instance's virtual server they offer higher performance and bandwidth to the instance. They are best used for temporary storage such as caching or temporary files, with persistent storage held on a different type of server. At one time, block-level storage was provided by storage area networks (SAN) and NAS provided file-level storage. With the shift from on- premises hosting to cloud services, this distinction has shifted. Even block- storage is now seen as distinct servers (thus NAS), rather than the previous array of bare discs.

Secondly, the term expresses the wish that all foreigners and migrant people encountered by these institutions may be accepted and particularly not be exposed to discrimination. Thirdly, the word welcoming culture means all the measures promoted by a positive attitude towards foreigners and migrants in others. The German word Willkommenskultur was elected in Austria in December 2015 as \\"Word of the Year\\". Foreign perspectives The Guardian distinguishes two meanings of the term welcoming culture: Originally it was meant to attract people from abroad to Germany to compensate for a huge shortage of skilled workers, particularly in sparsely populated areas. Since the beginning of the European refugee crisis in 2015, the term was being used to promote assistance for millions of refugees coming to Germany, who were received by highly visible posters \\"refugees welcome\\", and by actual help of any kind, mainly on private initiative of uncountable German citizens. Translation of the word \\"welcome\\" are found at many places, which are visited by tourists. The French daily Lib√©ration adds that the word \\"welcome culture\\" was originally created decades ago in the tourism industry. According to this view \\"welcome culture\\" would also be a Germanisation of the technical term Hospitality Management. The New York Times suggested that Chancellor Angela Merkel was also laying the foundation for new \\"hyphenated German\\" groups, namely \\"the Syrian-Germans, Iraqi-Germans, Afghan-Germans\\", alluding to the phenomenon of hyphenated American identities.

The Rocketman came to fame during the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season with main appearances occurring during the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs. Rocketman has also appeared in numerous news broadcasts and on ESPN's flagship show SportsCenter. Creation Rocketman was created by Malektronic CEO Ben Malek. Rocketman was originally part of a marketing campaign in partnership with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Malektronic speakers were given away at the game by Rocketman. After one of the speaker give aways at a Tampa Bay Lightning game Ben decided to have the Rocketman sit in one of his glass side seats. It was shortly after when people started to notice and post pictures and questions on social media about it. History The Malektronic Rocketman (Astronaut) was originally seen at the Tampa Bay Lightning vs L.A. Kings on February 7, 2015. However, Rocketman gained more nationwide exposure at a subsequent game on March 25, 2014 where the Tampa Bay Lightning played the Florida Panthers. The video and images from that game started the Rocketman on a viral social journey that would last all the way into and through the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs and well into the start of the 2015‚Äì16 NHL season. Actors More than one person has worn the Rocketman suit. Depending on the event they are attending there may be more than one actor donning the suit. Superfan vs Marketing Ploy There has been debate over the novelty of the Rocketman. The original social belief on the sight of an astronaut at hockey games was that it was a superfan. Latter many news agencies thought they were exposing Rocketman by reporting its \\"just\\" some company. While Malektronic will not deny the use of an astronaut at the games was part of some fun marketing they will still swear the superfan aspect is valid. Most of Malektronic‚Äôs employees are dedicated Tampa Bay Lightning fans and Malektronic CEO Ben Malek is a big fan of the Tampa Bay Lightning fan where he is a long time season ticket holder and a Suite owner. Some fans even bestow the \\"Superfan\\" title on Ben. The Chicago Connection During the 2014-2015 Stanley Cup Championship there became an interesting twist. Rocketman was attending all home games during the Championships. Once it came down to Tampa Bay Lightning vs Chicago Blackhawks some social media and news sources found out CEO Ben Malek used to be a die hard Chicago fan. Ben assured Tampa fans and friends he and Rocketman were still behind Tampa Bay 100% in the playoffs.

Dendera currently consists of lead singer Ashley Edison, lead guitarists Stephen Main, David Stanton, bassist Bradley Edison and drummer Andy Finch. As of June 2015, Dendera have released two studio albums and one EP. In 2016, Ashley Edison joined Power Quest as lead vocalist. Quote Ashley: \\"It is an honour to front one of my favourite bands of all time. Although as great as this may be, my duties and commitments with Dendera remain the same\\" History The band was formed in 2007 by original guitarist Tony Fuller and Steve Main. In the early stages of the band Dendera wrote what would become their 2011 EP. Ashley Edison took over as lead vocals in 2010 following a six-month search for a lead singer. Edison's vocals lifted the band to a new level giving Dendera the much needed status they deserved, with vocals shadowing Bruce Dickinson Rob Halford and James Labrie. After becoming a success in the Portsmouth and Southampton area, it was apparent Dendera had the potential to become a successful act. Therefore, after a favourable performance supporting Taking Dawn in 2011 there was a call for a change in the band's lineup. Dendera hired Drummer Andy Finch and bassist Bradley Edison (brother to Ashley) and produced their first studio album The Killing Floor which was well received by critics. On the departure of original guitarist Tony Fuller in 2015, David Stanton joined the band; assisting in the production of second album, Pillars of Creation.

The Guardian describes it as, \\"part reportage, part essay.\\" It explores the impact of mass immigration from Muslim countries on Dutch culture through the lens of the murder of film director and anti- immigration activist, Theo van Gogh. Murder in Amsterdam won the 2006 Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Argument Buruma argues that conservatives have \\"commandeered\\" the liberal values of the European Enlightenment to portray Islam and Western culture as \\"competing, hostile versions of absolute truth.\\" Buruma argues that murderers like the young Muslim who killed Theo van Gogh are driven to action by the failure of Dutch society to recognize them as full members of Dutch society, their new homeland. He concluded with a vague hope that reason and civility will prevail. Reception Christopher Caldwell wrote that Buruma is \\"less interested in the details of the killing than in what followed: the ideologies vindicated or discredited, the prejudices revealed and the doubts cast on the workability\\" of what Buruma regarded as Amsterdam's new, almost 50% immigrant society. Buruma cited data showing that Amsterdam 1999, was 45 per cent foreign in 1999, and would be 52% foreign by 2015.This includes all immigrants. About a third of the population is non- western, sixteen percent Muslim. Ongoing impact The book is regarded as an early exploration of the process of Islamist radicalization and commitment to Jihad. Buruma explores the steps by which in only a few months time, van Gogh's murderer, Mohammed Bouyeri, a young man born in the Netherlands and living a secular life, gave up Western clothing, donned a djellaba and prayer cap, stopped using alcohol and marijuana, grew a beard, stopped dating, cut all ties with old friends, and murdered a man, explaining in court that his Muslim faith required him ‚Äúto chop off the head of anyone who insults Allah and the prophet.‚Äù References Category:Islam in the Netherlands Category:Islamism in the Netherlands Category:2006 non-fiction books Category:Books about Islamism Category:Non-fiction books about immigration to Europe ","title":"Murder in Amsterdam"},{"id":"49239524","text":"The complex lines at Arlecdon and Rowrah shown on this map dated 1904 and 1914 Oatlands railway station served the village of Pica and Oatlands Colliery in the former English county of Cumberland, now part of Cumbria. Location The station was the only intermediate station on the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway's (C&WJR;) otherwise mineral branch which left the company's to main line at Rowrah Branch Junction south of Distington. The other station was at the branch's southern end. The , single track branch opened for mineral traffic on 1 May 1882 and was known locally as \\"Baird's Line\\" and officially as the Rowrah Branch. The branch's main purpose was to access the limestone quarries at Rowrah and the iron mines served by the Rowrah and Kelton Fell Railway, (RKFR) which the branch joined beyond Arlecdon at Rowrah Junction. The branch's second purpose was to carry coal from Oatlands Colliery which was next to the station. General goods came a distant third, workmen fourth and conventional passengers a remote last. The branch was six and a three quarter miles long, but its point to point length was a mere four and a half miles, the difference being due to the extremely sinuous course it had to take to keep the ruling gradient to a \\"mere\\" 1 in 44. The gradients largely favoured loaded trains, but they still had to cope with half a mile uphill through Arlecdon and a mile and a half uphill from Brownriggs Gill to Whillimoor Top. History The C&WJR; was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than those built by the C&WJR;, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Services Passenger services to Oatlands were a stuttering affair. An attempt to provide a regular Mondays to Saturdays service lasted a mere five months in 1883. In 1888 a Saturdays only out and back service to calling at and was tried, but abandoned in 1892. Another Saturdays only attempt was made in 1909, starting at . It was cut back to start at Oatlands from the end of 1916 and soldiered on on this basis until 1922 when it was withdrawn, never to resume. Given the sparse population of Oatlands, Arlecdon and surrounds to this day the venture had little chance of success. Unadvertised workmen's trains fared rather better, as here the sparse population worked in the railway's favour, with significant points of employment with similar start and end shift patterns at Rowrah and Oatlands, Records do not yet show when such services started, but they outlived the public passenger services by five years, ending for good on 1 January 1927. The line's 1920 Working Time Table shows two early morning trains from Oatlands to Arlecdon which turned straight round and went back again, with a similar procedure at the early afternoon shift change. In January 1898 the company agreed with the Postmaster General to carry a mail bag daily between Workington and Siddick and between Workington and Distington. It is likely that this was conveyed on passenger trains. At some point thereafter the service was extended to Rowrah. The \\"Mail Train\\" beyond Distington to Oatlands and Arlecdon usually consisted of a C&WJR; 0-6-0ST and a guards van. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons- guards van-locomotive-wagons-guards van-banker. Such trains worked regularly between and . The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. Rundown and closure The peak year for tonnage on C&WJR; lines was 1909, and for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. Bairds Line was hit from three directions: *Iron Ore became harder and costlier to win in the mines beyond Rowrah. The RKFR last paid a dividend in 1910, with Limestone being the biggest contributor. Most mines were worked out by 1914. *Oatlands Colliery ceased winding coal in 1932, depriving the branch of the only source of business which could not be dealt with by other routes, and *The LMSR, who had taken over all formerly rival company lines in the area in the Grouping of 1923 saw easy savings to be made by re-routing the residual limestone traffic from Rowrah first northwards via and Marron Junction, then, some years later, via where it continued until March 1978. The branch closed on 8 August 1938, along with Arlecdon and Oatlands stations which, like thousands of unsung stations right up to Beeching, were still providing a local goods service. Half a mile of Baird's Line was left in place at Arlecdon to act as a \\"backshunt\\" for the trains accessing the quarries. this remained in use until 1978 and was lifted in 1980 along with all other lines serving Rowrah. The station was subsequently demolished. Afterlife By 2013 the line of route north of Pica and south of Oatlands station was easy to see on satellite imagery, its course through the station site was much fainter. No station buildings appeared to remain.

The wind farm is planned to have a total capacity of up to 6 gigawatt (GW). The development has been split into a number of subzones. The 1.2 GW Project 1 gained planning consent in 2014; a second 1.4 GW Project 2 was given planning consent in 2016. In 2016 a third subzone was split into two projects Hornsea 3 and 4, with approximate capacities of 1‚Äì2 GW and 1 GW, increasing the capacity of the developed project to a maximum of 6 GW. Construction of the first phase started in January 2018, and the first turbines began supplying power to the UK national electricity grid in February 2019. History The tendering process for Round 3 offshore wind farm opportunities was begun by the Crown Estate in 2008. Bids were received in March 2009, and Zone Development Agreements signed in December 2009. The Hornsea development zone was awarded to a joint venture (SMart Wind) of Siemens and a consortium Mainstream Renewable Power including Hochtief. The development had an estimated potential generating capacity of 4 GW. The Hornsea site is one of three off the British coast in the North Sea, roughly halfway between the other two: Dogger Bank Wind Farm and East Anglia Wind Farm. The Hornsea site ('Zone 4', also known as 'Holderness' zone) has a total area of , and is from land at the closest point; water depth in the zone is from , with a tidal range of , and typical annual wave height of . The surface of the seabed consists primarily of sands and gravel. In 2011 the Danish firm √òrsted A/S (then named DONG Energy) became a partner in SMart Wind. In early 2015 √òrsted A/S 100% owner of the first phase, Project 1, of the scheme. √òrsted acquired rights to the remaining subzones of the Hornsea development (2 & 3) by August 2015. In 2016 √òrsted reached an agreement with the Crown Estate for amended plans for the Hornsea Two and Hornsea Three phases. Hornsea Three was split into two new projects, Hornsea Three and Hornsea Four; the new phases were expected to be developed in the 2020s. The changes increased the potential generating capacity of the wind farm to 6 GW, with Hornsea Three estimated at 1‚Äì2 GW and Hornsea Four at about 1 GW. In 2019 the failure of the plant was partially responsible for a large scale nationwide power cut on the evening of 9 August. Hornsea Project 1 The initial scoping report for \\"Project One\\" within the Hornsea zone identified it as a subzone of in the centre of the Hornsea zone, with an estimated potential wind farm of 1.2 GW, divided into two further subzones of 600 MW capacity each. The zone was to connect to an existing 400 kV National Grid substation at Killingholme. A variety of configurations were considered ‚Äì foundations of pile jacket, monopile or gravity base; turbines from 3.6 to 8 MW rated power; with electrical power export by HVDC. Later DONG Energy added the consideration to use HVAC export cables. The chosen cable export was planned to make landfall at Horsehoe Point (northeast of Marshchapel, East Lindsey), then passing west and northwest to a substation near Killingholme Power Station, North Killingholme in North Lincolnshire. Within the zone of Project 1 the primary underlying geology consisted of deposits from the Quaternary Period consisting of Bolders bank, Botney Cut and Eem formations ‚Äì primarily sediments or tills ‚Äì gravelley/sandy clays, overlying sediments were sands or gravels up to thick, with waves within the area varying in height by . Project 1 water depths were generally . In 2011 Smart Wind signed lease agreements with the Crown Estate for \\"Heron Wind\\" and \\"Njord\\" areas making up the zone. The zone was given provisional contract for difference renewable subsidies by the UK government in April 2014. Hornsea Project 1 was given planning consent in December 2014. The 'contract for difference' strike price was ¬£140 per MWh. In early 2015 DONG acquired all of the project, becoming 100% owner. Seabed investigation including boreholes at turbine foundation positions was completed by Fugro by April 2015. In mid 2015 DONG selected Siemens Wind Power 7 MW turbines with rotor turbines for the project ‚Äì around 171 turbines would be used for the wind farm. In its 2015 financial report DONG stated it had chosen to use suction bucket foundations on a third of the turbines at Hornsea. The rationale for use of the new foundation type is thought to be a simplified foundation installation, requiring only a heavy-lift crane to lower the foundation to the sea bed, reducing costs. DONG Energy formally committed to building the wind farm in early 2016. The expected completion date for the project was 2020. A ¬£25 million contract to construct the onshore substation at North Killingholme had been awarded to Balfour Beatty in late 2015. NKT Cables and ABB were awarded ‚Ç¨139 (c. $158) million and $250 million contracts to supply 220 kV AC export cables in March/April 2016. In late 2016 JDR Cables was contracted to supply of inter-array subsea power cables for the wind farm; Nexans was awarded a contract for of inter-array cables; and EEW was awarded a contract to supply 116 monopiles. Bladt Industries/Offshore Structures (Britain) Ltd. was awarded a contract for 96 tower transition pieces in early 2017, to be constructed at Aalborg, Denmark and Billingham, UK. =Construction= Construction of the onshore cable route was begun in late 2016 under J. Murphy & Sons. The wind farm was scheduled to be constructed between 2018 and 2020, and expected to provide an annual production of around 4.1 terawatt-hours (TWh). The first foundation of the new windpark was installed by DEME Group's subsidiary GeoSea in January 2018. The export cables were installed by Tideway Offshore Solutions, a subsidiary company of the Belgian DEME Group. The installation was completed in December 2018, several months ahead of schedule. Hornsea 1 began supplying power to the UK national electricity grid in February 2019, with full completion expected in the first quarter of 2020. The final monopile foundation was completed in April 2019 and as of 3 May 2019, 28 turbines out of 174 had been installed. At 16:52:33 on Friday 9 August 2019, lightning struck a 400 kV mainland transmission line between Eaton Socon and Wymondley north of London, causing small generators, Little Barford Power Station (641 MW) and Hornsea (737 MW) to unexpectedly disconnect a combined 1,878 MW (1,691 MW maximum single-time) supply within minutes, greater than the 1,000 MW limit. Grid frequency declined to 48.8 Hz, below the limit at 49.5 Hz, and 1.1 million customers were disconnected; rail services were disrupted with 371 trains cancelled, 220 part cancelled, and 873 trains delayed. Power was restored at 17:37. Hornsea disconnected due to a software flaw, which was fixed the next day. The final turbine was installed in October 2019 and the project was completed in early 2020. Hornsea Project 2 A scoping report for \\"Project Two\\" was published in October 2012. The subzone was expected to be developed in a number of phases, with a potential wind turbine capacity of 1.8 GW, in an area of around located in the centre of the Hornsea wind farm zone. Project 2 was use the same route for its electrical export cable as Project One, and to use either HVAC or HVDC with a separate onshore substation. Suitable areas for the Project 2 development were identified as being adjacent to the north, east or west of the Zone 1, which was located in the shallowest area of the whole Hornsea zone. The design considered piled, suction pile, monopile or gravity base foundations for wind turbines of 5 to 15 MW rated power. As with Project 1 sea bed conditions and geology consisted of Quaternary period deposits, primarily sediments of sand, till and clays, with the overlying gravel or sand seabed including sandwaves, with the average water depth of . In 2013 SMart wind signed lease agreements with the Crown Estate for the \\"Optimus Wind\\" and \\"Breesea\\" areas making up Project 2 of Hornsea wind farm. A planning application for Project 2 was submitted and accepted for examination in early 2015; its wind turbine area was located adjacent northwest of the Project 1 area, with the cable export route following that of Project 1 adjacent on the northward side. Planning permission for the development was awarded in August 2016, for 300 turbines covering at a height of each. At the time of the award, Dong had committed to building 174 turbines, but the whole project is the biggest marine wind farm in the world. Turbine installation is expected to commence in 2021. When operational in 2022, Hornsea Project 2 will be the biggest offshore wind farm in the world. Hornsea Project 3 DONG Energy (which in November 2017 changed its name to √òrsted) began consultation on the project three development in May 2016. Project 3 will be to the east of Projects 1 and 2, with an estimated maximum capacity of 2.4 GW over . √òrsted submitted a Development consent application in 2018, with a decision on the project expected to be made during July 2020. The project is expected to begin construction in 2022, and be completed by 2025. Hornsea Project 4 √òrsted put forward a plan to add a fourth area to the Hornsea wind farm in 2018, with the area covering , and being located adjacent, north-west of Hornsea Project 1. During 2018 and 2019, consultation with the local communities which will be affected by the project occurred, with a Development Consent Order application being expected to occur during the first quarter of 2020. Construction of the wind farm is expected to start in 2023, and be operational by 2027, at the earliest. The project's capacity is unknown by √òrsted due to the ever increasing size of available wind turbines for the project.

It was discovered on 30 January 1992, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. The asteroid was named after the Russian city of Chelyabinsk and for its spectacular Chelyabinsk meteor event in 2013.  Classification and orbit  Chelyabinsk orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.3‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 3 months (814 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 38¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken during the Digitized Sky Survey at the Australia Siding Spring Observatory in January 1990, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 2 years prior to its official discovery at La Silla. = Close approaches = As a near-Earth object, Chelyabinsk has a low Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of , which translates into 120.1 lunar distances (LD). This is, however, far too large to make it a potentially hazardous asteroid, which have intersection distances of less than 20 LD. It also crosses the orbit of Mars at 1.666 AU which makes it a Mars-crossing asteroid. In August 2142, it will approach the Red Planet at .  Physical characteristics  Chelyabinsk has been characterized as both a Q-type and L-type asteroid. It is also a generically assumed S-type asteroid. = Lightcurves = Two rotational light-curves of Chelyabinsk were obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ond≈ôejov Observatory in December 2002 and September 2004, respectively. They gave a rotation period of 22.490 and hours, each with a brightness variation of 0.13 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Chelyabinsk measures between 2.79 and 4.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.21 and 0.37, while observations by the Japanese Akari satellite gave an albedo of 0.26 and a diameter of 3.5 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts Petr Pravec's revised WISE results, that is, a diameter of 4.23 kilometers and an albedo of 0.179 based on an absolute magnitude of 14.35.  Naming  This minor planet is named after the Russian city Chelyabinsk, located in the Urals, Siberia. The city is well known for the Chelyabinsk meteor, a 20-meter sized, extremely bright fireball that exploded to the south of the city at an altitude of 30 kilometers on 15 February 2013. The indirect effects of the explosion injured more than 1,500 people. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) on 21 August 2013 (). = Erratum = Originally, the name \\"Chelyabinsk\\" was erroneously given by the MPC to the numerically similar asteroid on 22 July (). The wrong designation was deleted in the subsequent publication of the Minor Planet Circulars on 21 August 2013 ()  Notes  References  External links  * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR ‚Äì Observatoire de Gen√®ve, Raoul Behrend  021088 Category:Discoveries by Eric Walter Elst Category:Minor planets named for places Category:Named minor planets 19920130 ","title":"21088 Chelyabinsk"},{"id":"49239582","text":"NRDS Dhamdhama is a private computer institute in Dhamdhama, Nalbari, India.

It was published by Candlewick in 2014 and was selected as a Caldecott Honor Book in 2015.  Description  The story, written by Barnett is told in the present tense, from a third person narrative point of view. The book for the most part follows a layout of having the image on one page and having the accompanying text on the page next to it, with the exception of a few pages where the image extends to both pages. The book also greatly incorporates the use of white space.  Plot  Two brothers named Sam and Dave, alongside their unnamed canine friend, have embarked on a journey to find something spectacular, \\"On Monday Sam and Dave dug a hole.\\" They are determined in their search \\"We won't stop digging until we find something spectacular\\" and they proceed to dig through a vast distance. Along the way they dig past many jewels and potential \\"spectacular\\" objects, which notably enough only their dog seems to be aware of. The illustrations rely heavily on the positioning of the eyes to describe the relationship between the objects in the frame that are hidden to the boys but are aware to the dog, as shown in various frames such as on pages 8 and 10 the two brothers are shown to be fixated on the task at hand whereas the dog is focused more on the jewel that is nearby. They continue their journey, passing by many jewels along the way until they become too tired and decide to take a rest. The illustrations then depict the dog continuing to dig deeper in the ground until they all fall through the hole. \\"Sam and Dave fell down, down, down, until they landed in the soft dirt.\\" The story concludes with them landing back into an area that looks like their original yard but is not their yard at all as shown by distinct differences in the frames from the 3 pages and the last 3 pages, such as the apple tree that is in their yard at the beginning of the story is replaced by a pear tree and the red flower that is on their porch in the beginning of the book is replaced by a blue flower at the end of the story.  Critical reception  Sam and Dave Dig a Hole received positive reviews. Horn Book called it \\"Mind-blowing in the best way possible\\", Kirkus Reviews said it was \\"something spectacular\\".

Robert Elliott Burns is having flashbacks of the horrors of World War I and is on the streets protesting for himself angry at his inability to find a job and society's apathy towards veterans. The next day, he is at his parents' home and his brother Vincent, a minister, tries to console him. Elliot says he's had enough and wants to go down to Florida to find work. Elliot is heading to Florida by train and by the time he stops outside of Atlanta, he is now a penniless vagrant. He joins a group of vagrants around a campfire that intend to rob him, but another man saves him from it. He offers Burns a chance to make some money by robbing a country store. Burns goes with the man to rob it, but tries to back out at the last second. The man holds him at gunpoint to rob the cash register, which contains only $5. The man knocks Burns out with his weapon and runs away, leaving Burns to be apprehended by local police. He is taken to court and his lawyer tells him he should plead guilty. The judge gives him a trumped up sentence of six to ten years hard labor. Burns is taken to the Fulton County prison camp. It is a foul place consisting of wooden shacks, stocks, sweatboxes, and pure filth. He has iron chains attached to his legs and meets the warden, Harold Hardy, a fat, angry, and spiteful man of Irish descent who hates people from the North. Hardy calls him a \\"Yankee\\" and tells him to feel guilty and get used to chain gang life to make it easier on himself. He has one of his guards, Mr. Trump, escort Burns to his quarters. Burns is introduced to a foul shack of filthy, exhausted men and meets an elderly prisoner, Pappy Glue who laughs at him when he says he didn't commit the crime he was imprisoned for. He is introduced to an inedible meal of pig fat, bitter corn pone, and sorghum molasses and gags trying to eat it and gives his plate to a veteran prisoner enjoying and devouring it. The next morning, the men are awakened at 5 am. Burns sleeps through the removal of the chains and is thrown on the floor by Trump. The men are taken to a quarry to dig rocks out of the ground with pick axes for 15 hours a day, with only a short lunch break of cowpeas and corn mush. A fellow prisoner, George Seals, falls over from exhaustion. Trump kicks him in the face and Seals pleads for water and to not be hit. That night after work, Seals is hung upside down and beaten several times with a leather strap by Trump and left there overnight. By dawn, he's died from the beatings and overwork and placed in a pine box. The next day, the men are digging out dirt with pick axes and Burns is struggling to \\"keep the lick\\" towards the end of their shift. A black prisoner sings \\"There's Gold in the Ground\\" to help the men keep working. That night, the men are having their chains checked and Warden Hardy wants to smell the men to make sure they put in a good days work. He taunts Burns, asking how much he likes the chain gang, and Burns smarts off to him about Southern hospitality. He is taken by Hardy and two guards and put into a sweatbox until the next night. Burns is removed from the sweatbox and thrown onto the floor of the sleeping cabin. He declares to Pappy Glue he needs to get out of there. Pappy tells him he needs to get used to the life on the chain gang because the only way he is getting out is the same way as Seals. Sometime later the men are working on the railroad putting metal ties on the tracks with sledgehammers. Burns notices Big Sam, a towering black prisoner, can really swing the hammer. During a lunch break, Burns talks Big Sam into bending his shackles with the sledgehammer by hitting it against the track. That way, Burns can slide the chains off and \\"hang it on a limb\\" or escape. Sam does it with the guards backs turned and Burns is in extreme pain from it. That night, the men return to camp and Burns has his chains checked by Trump, and they are checked out fine. Hardy is now asking Burns if he likes the chain gang, and Burns obediently answers yes. In his bunk, Burns removes the shackles in front of Pappy and invites him to come along. Pappy declines but gives him $5, wishing him luck. The next day, Burns asks to \\"get out here\\", to relieve himself in the woods. While doing do, he removes his shackles, then makes a run for it. The guards and dogs run after him and he takes a boat in the swamp to freedom. Warden Hardy is furious, screaming out to Burns that he promises to find him. Later on that day, Burns is at a train station in Marietta and just before boarding, he thinks the police are about to catch him. But instead they catch a vagrant. He boards the train and makes it across the Tennessee border. A year later, Burns is now living in Chicago and rents a room from Emily Pacheco, a Portuguese divorcee. She is a very nice and courteous but overly possessive woman. He types a letter to his brother Vincent about his work status and trying to get authorities to convince them of his innocence. She tells Burns to stop writing and typing so much and they go to a movie together. She keeps trying to get Burns' interest, but he's not in love with her and just doesn't feel the chemistry, but nevertheless, they sleep together after he reveals to her about trying to start a magazine business and be a statesman. He moves forward with starting the business. Burns receives a letter from his brother Vincent that their father is dying. He goes back to New Jersey to attend the funeral afterwards. His mother is very upset that he wasn't ever able to come back to visit. Burns arrives home and Emily is all over him begging him to marry her, but he wants alone time. One day while cleaning Burns' room, Emily comes across some papers he's been typing and there are flashbacks to his time on the chain gang being put in a sweatbox and treated like an animal. Emily is disturbed at the writing. Burns makes it home that night after a very successful day of selling his first magazine subscription and she reveals the papers he's written. He's very distressed, but she consoles him and asks him to make love to her and blackmails him into marriage. By 1929, Burns is making it big in Chicago as a magazine publisher and motivational speaker. He's working long hours and neglecting Emily who is becoming increasingly possessive and jealous. While speaking at a dinner engagement, Burns meets a woman named Lilian Salo. After a few dates, he falls in love with her, much to Emily's dismay. He wants an amicable divorce, but she is furious and refuses. A few days later at work, Burns is apprehended by police. Georgia authorities want Burns extradited back, but his lawyer refuses. They meet with a Georgia prison official in front of the judge assigned to hear the case. The official says if extradition is granted, he will have to go back to Georgia and serve the remainder of his sentence, plus additional time for escaping. But if he comes back voluntarily, he can serve a reduced term of 45 days and be paroled. He would also serve the time as a trustee at one of the honor farms. Burns is returned to the same Fulton County camp he escaped from with Warden Hardy greeting him. When presented with the court agreement Burns signed in Chicago, Hardy says that \\"he is in Georgia now and things will be done Georgia's way.\\" In the chow hall, Hardy berates Burns for his success and tells the prisoners that they are not to ever talk to him, and if Burns runs away again for the guards to kill him. A month later, Burns is out working and secretly asking prisoners of the whereabouts of Big Sam, the black prisoner, the helped him get away, and Pappy Glue. Big Sam clubbed a guard and was moved to another prison in Southern Georgia and Pappy Glue died from beatings soon after Burns escaped. Burns is angry and pauses for a few seconds and asks to wipe off the sweat, but Trump refuses to let him do so. That night at dinner, Hardy reads out a list of men not doing a hard days work and for them to get their whipping. Burns is included. Burns declares it's a lie, but none of the guards or Hardy defend him. He is tied to a tree and given ten lashes. Some time later, Lillian comes to visit Burns assuring him of clemency, parole, or pardon. They embrace and the guards try to remove him, but he resists it and is beaten and placed in the stocks. Warden Hardy assures Burns he won't live to see himself get out despite people from up north trying to do so, and that the parole board turned him down. Burns realizes he was duped and will have to serve the remainder of his sentence. Burns' brother comes to visit sometime later and tells him that his business is gone, but indirectly signals to him that there is money left from his business hidden inside a package of Lucky Strike cigarettes to help him get out. Mr. Rayford, another guard who works with Trump, detects Vincent giving Burns a package of cigarettes and wants to check it, but ends up taking a few of them for himself and gives Burns the package back. Later on, Burns finds over $100 in cash in it and feels it will be his ticket to freedom. Burns is back working later on and Trump has made him a trustee. Trump orders Burns to fill up the water pail while he goes in a country store to get a soda pop. While Trump is in the store, Burns talks to a local man that approaches him. The man says he's read about Burns in the papers and thinks he's had the short end of the stick on what has happened to him and that he would get him out if he could. Burns shows him a $50 bill and asks him to meet him the next day with his car, a hacksaw, and a change of clothes. The man is apprehensive, knowing he risks being put on the same chain gang, but Burns promises him another $50 if he can get him over the state line. The next day, Burns is working diligently and the man shows up. He asks to \\"get out\\" to relieve himself, and Rayford allows him to do so. Burns immediately runs for the man's car and Rayford shoots at him for trying to escape but misses. Warden Hardy is more furious than ever, telling the guards they will lose their jobs if they don't catch him. Some time later, Burns is seen typing his new book which says that he is a fugitive, he moves around a lot and can't keep jobs for long. The book he is writing depicts his time on the chain gang and it's horrific conditions. He specifically mentions the men who died while he was imprisoned and dedicates the book to them. Burns briefly visits his brother about his situation, who tells him there are several people asking to have movie rights to the book. Burns grants his brother Power of Attorney, then disappears into the night. Some time later, Burns visits his former love Lilian, who is now married. She says she had been praying for him the entire time and she is happy to see him alive and well. He later goes to a local library to read his published book and hears on the radio that it will be made into a movie. Burns anonymously attends a screening of the movie I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and has flashbacks to his time there. He is satisfied to find that the movie accurately reflects what he has been through.

He was the grandson of Sultan Murad III and Safiye Sultan, the half-brother of the future sultan Ahmed I and the brother of Mustafa I. Early life ≈ûehzade Mahmud was born in Manisa Palace, when his father was still a prince, and the governor of the Saruhan Sanjak. His mother was Halime Sultan. Mahmud along with his brothers was educated by Mustafa Efendi, who was appointed by Mehmed in 1592. When Murad died in 1595, ≈ûehzade Mehmed ascended the throne as Mehmed III, Mahmud came to Istanbul with his father. Upon ascending the throne, his father ordered the execution of nineteen of his own brothers and half brothers. In Istanbul In Istanbul, Mahmud was very popular with the Janissaries. Mehmed was disturbed by Mahmud‚Äôs eagerness to leave the palace and take up the role of warrior prince, especially since he himself had grown so fat that he could not campaign. Hoping to dispel his father‚Äôs worries over provincial rebellions and Safavid advances, Mahmud would ask his father to send him, and give him the command of the army. Whenever he spoke like that, Ahmed would try unsuccessfully to stop him because this made Mehmed distressful. Furthermore, Mehmed feared that the youth intended to mount a rebellion against him from within the palace. Mahmud became grievous to see how his father was altogether led by Safiye Sultan, his grandmother and the state was going into ruin. His mother was also not favoured by Safiye. According to Turkish tradition all princes were expected to work as provincial governors (Sanjak-bey) as a part of their training. However, Mahmud being too young was not yet circumcised, nor was sent to govern any province because of the outgoing Jelali revolts and the long Turkish War, an indecisive land war between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire, primarily over the Principalities of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. Rumors of conspiracy to poison Mehmed in order to bring Mahmud to the command of the empire were spreading in the capital. Discussion took place among the viziers of the imperial council as to which of the sultan‚Äôs sons should be designated heir to the throne. The viziers were divided into two groups, one supporting Mahmud, the other favoring his brother ≈ûehzade Ahmed. According to another rumor if the conspiracy to assassinate the sultan failed, Mahmud would be secretly taken to a province, where he could easily gather an army and fight for the throne. Moreover, Mahmud's mother sent a message to a religious seer for she was superstitious to know if her son would become the next Sultan, and how long her husband would reign. The man answered, but the message was intercepted by Abd√ºrrezzak Agha, the chief black eunuch of the imperial harem, and who later gave it to Mehmed and Safiye, instead of her. The message said that Mehmed would die within six months without showing whether by death or deposition, and her son will become the next Sultan. Safiye incensed Mehmed, and he had Mahmud examined, who indeed knew nothing of his mother's action. Imprisonment Mahmud was imprisoned, and beaten to make him confess. After two days he was beaten again having every time two hundred blows but nothing came out. Then his mother was called in question and examined, who confessed that she did send a message to the religious seer to know about her son's fortune, but without any intention of hurt or thought of the deprivation of her husband. But this statement did not satisfy Mehmed and his mother, Safiye. The Sultan decided to consult with his grand vizier Yemi≈ü√ßi Hasan Pasha and the mufti on the issue. He demanded a legal opinion from Mufti Ebulmeyamin Mustafa Efendi, whether he could execute his son or not. The mufti gave the opinion that he cannot execute his son without any witnesses, and could only be executed on the ground that his death would satisfy his father. Execution Mahmud was executed on 7 June 1603 by four deaf mutes in a harem room while Mehmed III waited outside. After his order was carried out, Mehmed entered the room to make sure that Mahmud was dead. After Mahmud's death, Mehmed's only two sons left were the future Sultans Ahmed I and Mustafa I. His followers who were supposed to be involved in the matter were thrown into the sea. It was rumored that his mother was also executed. However, she was sent to the Eski (old) Palace by the end of June. After his death, Mahmud was remembered as courageous and jealous, and joined the category of those who were much loved by the janissaries, an Ottoman way of posthumously describing ambitious princes who did not make it. Aftermath Mehmed died on 22 December just six and a half months later. According to a source the cause of Mehmed's death was distress caused by Mahmud's death. Mehmed's son, Mahmud's half-brother Ahmed ascended the throne as Sultan Ahmed I. Mahmud who had been buried firstly obscurely, was honored with burial in a tomb built on the orders of his brother Ahmed, in ≈ûehzade Mosque, Istanbul. Ahmed also sent Safiye Sultan to the Eski (old) Palace on Friday January 1604, along with his brother Mustafa. He also replaced the chief black eunuch of the imperial harem, Abd√ºrrezzak Agha, with a new one Cevher Agha, because of his role in Mahmud's execution. In popular culture In the 2015 TV series Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l: K√∂sem, ≈ûehzade Mahmud is portrayed by as a child by Turkish actor Arda Ta≈üarcan, and as adult by Turkish actor Barƒ±≈ü Cankurtaran.

Completed in 2006, it was Johnson's final project, as he did not live to see construction finished. The building's name is a reference to Johnson's earlier Glass House, located in New Canaan, Connecticut, although the urban building bears little resemblance to the original. The interiors were designed by Annabelle Selldorf, an American designer and architect. The building saw a downturn in sales after the construction of a New York City Department of Sanitation garage across the street was announced in 2007. Development The original Glass House The building was initially to be developed by restauranter and developer Antonio Vendome. Vendome commissioned Johnson to create a building of multi-colored bricks which, unlike the current design, eschewed right angles and was asymmetrical, atypical for Johnson. This plan was referred to as a \\"living sculpture\\". The original plans also called for a significantly taller building, at twenty stories high. Due to zoning restrictions, this plan was abandoned. During development, Vendome withdrew from the project, selling his stake to three other developers: Charles Blaichman, Scott Sabbagh, and Abram Shnay. The three asked Johnson to draw from his past designs, including the Seagram Building, to inform the plans for the structure. After Alan Ritchie, Johnson's architectural partner, suggested an homage to Johnson's original Glass House, plans were changed to reflect that idea. After the redesign, SLCE Architects was brought in to refine and complete the structure due to Johnson's impending retirement, and, ultimately, his death. Annabel Selldorf, responsible for the building's interiors, also drew inspiration from the original Glass House. She incorporated, for example, herringbone floors similar to those in the Johnson house, albeit made of white oak, rather than brick. =Sanitation Department controversy= Not long after the building began sales, the New York City Department of Sanitation announced the construction of a truck garage across the street, at 353 Spring, which sparked controversy and a downturn in sales. The space was originally occupied by a UPS lot and a smaller Department of Sanitation building. During development, purchasers were made aware that a high rise or a garage could someday occupy the space. The new structure drew ire due to worries that it would obscure views of the Hudson River for many of the residences in the building. Efforts to prevent the structure's construction failed, despite support from celebrities including James Gandolfini, Lou Reed, John Slattery, and Michael Stipe. A garage designed by Dattner Architects was eventually erected on the site; later, a salt storage shed, also designed by Dattner, was built as well. The two new structures, after completion, received with praise as \\"[one] of the best examples of new public architecture in the city\\" and \\"a boon to the neighborhood\\". Usage and residents The building is primarily residential, with forty apartments. Amenities include bicycle storage and an in house fitness facility. There is also ground level retail and a restaurant, which belongs to Antonio Vendome, the original developer of the property. Marina Abramoviƒá lived in the building until 2014. Sol Kerzner has also owned a residence in the building.

In the mid-1980s, the Telecom Authority of Singapore entered into a joint venture development with GEC Marconi in the UK to develop a photo-videotext public service. Selected engineers were sent to the UK to work within the Marconi development team stationed at Fleet, Hampshire, England. Singapore was the first country in the world to launch an interactive information service to the public which included photographic images. The service started trials during late 1987 using specifically designed terminals. Controlled trials had been conducted since 1987 as the infrastructure was installed and trialed successfully. It finally went into full public service in 1991. Subscribers connected to the Teleview, now-defunct, service by SingTel, via a dial up connection initially by 1200‚Äì2400 bit modems (v.22bis) and then later via 9600-14400 kbit/s modems. Pages with photographic images were sent to the terminal by Full Field Teletext transmissions from dedicated data inserters/UHF TV Transmitters. Subscribers initially paid no time based usage fee for this service. However, later charges, on top of telephone line charges were levied. A later development from Teleview provided an interfaced connection to the Internet, subscribers were given access to the Internet via a text-only terminal; email was accessed by Pine, and webpages were viewed by Lynx. Subsequently, Teleview was rendered obsolete, and SingNet started offering to the Internet via Serial Line Internet Protocol/Point-to-Point Protocol (SLIP/PPP) over modem. System The information storage and delivery system was based upon GPT4190 computers coupled to dial in modem for public to access and via microwave link to a UHF TV Transmitter fitted with full field teletext inserters. Transmission of lower level protocol data and user terminal management control was via telephone V22 modem. High level data such as Geometric and photographic displays sent exclusively by full field teletext with interchange control and handshaking via V22 modem. The service profile is based upon extensions to the existing CEPT Videotext Services Recommendations T/CD 6-1 as defined in Teleview Videotext Service Profile and Data Standard Ref; 7630/DS/1 1987. Terminal The terminal was based upon two Motorola 68000 processors as a general main computer and control and the second as a video processor interfaced to VRAM video memory with shift register to output. A further processor based upon Texas Instruments TMS7000 as the control for the field field teletext, RF tuning control and packet decoding for 8 bit data transfer to the main processor as well as a Micronas MAS2122 Modem chipset for the telephone interface. RF Tuning was achieved by Telefunken multiband tuner, voltage tuned via SP5000 with the channel selection supplied by the TMS7000. This tuner with agc IF detection provides the composite video to the data slicer (TMS3556) and data detector/converter (TMS3551)under control from the TMS7000 (TMS77C82 mask programmed version). Further more the main processor operated as a computer running Metacomco BASIC software with keyboard entry via an infrared coupled standard qwerty keyboard with additional keys to select videotext, teletext or PC modes.

Palma was a businessman who was served as Borough President of Staten island from 1933 to 1945. ‚Äî Prior to his election as borough president in 1933, he served for 12 years with the U.S. Secret Service. Biography Palma was born in Rosebank on June 5, 1889 and attended public schools on Staten Island. Palma became a detective with the New York State detective force in 1909 and six years later was named a special operative with the Secret Service. He headed the Secret Service‚Äôs Michigan and New York units and later was the principal agent of the Treasury Department‚Äôs detective unit. His accomplishments included safeguarding delegates to the Washington Peace Conference in 1921. While serving in Detroit, Palma developed a lasting friendship with industrialist Henry Ford. When he retired from the Secret Service in 1929, he opened Palma Motors, a Ford dealership, on Castleton Avenue in West Brighton. He, and later his son, David, ran the dealership until 1958. Palma was elected borough president in 1933 on the Republican- Fusion ticket, narrowly defeating incumbent John Lynch by 541 votes. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia‚Äôs Fusion Party urged non-partisan government administration of New York City. Although the country was caught up in Democratic fervor following the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, many Republicans in New York City contests were elected when they also were endorsed by the Fusion Party, Palma among them.  Accomplishments  During his three terms in office, Staten Island benefited from many city, state and federal projects. The country‚Äôs first foreign trade zone was established in Stapleton, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk at South Beach and George Cromwell Recreation Center in Tompkinsville were built. Additionally, during Palma‚Äôs administration Drumgoole Boulevard was constructed, hundreds of miles of roads were rebuilt and more than $3 million in new drainage facilities were installed. One of Palma‚Äôs unrealized goals was to link Staten Island with Manhattan. He envisioned a tunnel running from St. George to Manhattan. City officials found this proposal ludicrous and labeled it ‚ÄúPalma‚Äôs Folly.‚Äù He also supported the concept of a new bridge across the Narrows. Palma left office in 1945, the first of the Staten Island‚Äôs borough presidents to step down voluntarily. He became president of the American Atlantic Trading Corp., an import-export firm in Manhattan. In 1951, he was named to an executive post in the National Civil Defense Administration and continued that assignment until 1967. He ran again for borough president in 1955 as an independent, but finished third in the race, losing to Democrat Albert Maniscalco. Palma‚Äôs first wife, Marie Moore, died in 1940. The couple had 11 children, Joseph Jr., David, Marie, Robert, George, Alice, John, Richard, James, Eileen and Raymond. His second wife, Christine Sullivan, died in 1966. Palma died at the age of 80, on October 18, 1969. Palma built and lived in the home featured in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 Oscar-winning movie The Godfather with his wife Marie and 11 children until it was sold for nearly $1.7 million to the Norton family in 1951. The five-bedroom, seven bathroom, 6,248-square-foot English Tudor style mansion sits on a 2,400-square-foot open expanse at 110 Longfellow Avenue on Emerson Hill.

It is classified as one of the eight Shakta Upanishads and attached to the Rigveda. The Upanishad is notable for asserting that the Self (soul, Atman) is a Goddess who alone existed before the creation of the universe. She is the supreme power, asserts the text, she is the ultimate reality (Brahman), from her being and because of her the universe was born, she is the knowledge, the consciousness and the soul (Atman) of every being. The philosophical premises of Bahvricha Upanishad assert the feminine as non-different, non-dual (Advaita) from transcendent reality, she being the primary and the material cause of all existence, and the text belongs to the Shaktadavaitavada tradition (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti). History Neither the author nor the composition date of Bahvricha Upanishad is known. The text was likely composed, in the same period as other Shakta Upanishads, between the 12th- and 15th-century CE. The text existed before the 14th-century, states Max Muller, as it was referenced by the 13th/14th-century Dvaita Vedanta scholar Madhvacharya. In 19th-century compilations of the Upanishads, a part of the Aitareya Aranyakas from the Rigveda was sometimes called Aitareya Upanishad, Atmasatka Upanishad and also Bahvricha Upanishad.Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 270 The Devi-related medieval era Bahvricha Upanishad is different from the ancient BCE era Aitareya Upanishad, but both discuss the nature of Atman (soul, Self).Paul Deussen (1997), Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 7‚Äì20Patrick Olivelle (1998), The Early Upanisads, Oxford University Press, , pages 314‚Äì323 Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Bahvrcopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 268‚Äì270, 467‚Äì468 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 107. Contents The text consists of 9 verses. Some manuscripts include a prelude in the form of an invocation asserting that the Vedas must be imbibed in one‚Äôs mind, thoughts and speech, and through truth only is peace assured. The Upanishad opens with the assertion \\"Devi is one and she alone existed in the beginning\\", she is Kama (love), and she is Atman (soul, Self), The second verse of the Upanishad states that not only Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra are her progeny but every being in the universe is her creation. The Upanishad describes Devi as identical to all truth and reality, and whatever is not she as unreal, non-truth and non-self. She is the ultimate unchanging reality (Brahman), the consciousness, the bliss who shines by herself. She is everywhere, within and without, asserts the Upanishad. She is pure, she is love and she symbolized as the Tripurasundari goddess is the form of all. She is the ardha matra, last half syllable, of the Om syllable. Her Shakti is in Om. > She alone is Atman. Other than She is untruth, non-self. She is Brahman- > Consciousness. She is the Vidya of Consciousness, nondual Brahman > Consciousness, a wave of Being-Consciousness-Bliss. The Beauty of the three- > great-cities, penetrating without and within, is resplendent, nondual, self- > subsisting. What is, is pure Being; what shines, is pure Consciousness; what > is dear, is Bliss. So here is the Maha-Tripura-sundari who assumes all > forms. You and I and all the world and all divinities and all besides are > the Maha-Tripura-sundari. The sole Truth is the thing named \\"the Beautiful\\". > It is the nondual, integral, supreme Brahman. ‚Äì Bahvricha Upanishad Verse 5 > (Abridged), Translated by AG Krishna Warrier The closing verses of the text asserts that she should be contemplated as \\"That which I am\\", as Sodasi and fifteen syllabled Sri Vidya, the power of Savitur, Sarasvati, and Gayatri, the sacred, the mother, the auspicious who chooses her own partner, the mistress, the dark, the light, the Brahmic bliss.

He was one of four brothers, Thomas \\"Shake\\" Edmonds Jr., Leon Edmonds, and Robert Edmonds. He grew up attending a Methodist church in South Knoxville. = World War II = Edmonds enlisted in the Army on March 17, 1941 at Fort Oglethorpe. Edmonds, along with other inexperienced troops, arrived in the combat zone December 1944, with the 106th Infantry Division, arriving only five days before Germany launched a massive counteroffensive, Battle of the Bulge. During the battle, on 19 December 1944, Edmonds was captured and sent to a German prisoner-of-war (POW) camp: Stalag IX-B. Shortly thereafter, he was transferred, with other enlisted personnel, to another POW camp near Ziegenhain, Germany: Stalag IX-A. As the senior noncommissioned officer at the new camp, Master Sergeant Edmonds was responsible for the camp's 1,275 American POWs. On their first day in Stalag IX-A, January 27, 1945‚Äîas Germany's defeat was clearly approaching‚ÄîCommandant Siegmann ordered Edmonds to tell only the Jewish-American soldiers to present themselves at the next morning's assembly so they could be separated from the other prisoners. Instead, Edmonds ordered all 1,275 POWs to assemble outside their barracks. The German commandant rushed up to Edmonds in a fury, placed his pistol against Edmonds's head and demanded that he identify the Jewish soldiers under his command. Instead, Edmonds responded, \\"We are all Jews here,\\" and told the commandant that if he wanted to shoot the Jews he would have to shoot all of the prisoners. He then warned the commandant that if he harmed any of Edmonds' men, the commandant would be prosecuted for war crimes after the conflict ended‚Äîsince the Geneva Conventions required prisoners to give only their name, rank, and serial number; religion was not required. The commandant backed down. Edmonds' actions are credited with saving up to 200 Jewish-American soldiers from possible death. After 100 days of captivity, Edmonds returned home after the war, but kept the event at the POW camp to himself. =Postwar life= Edmonds never told his family of the event at the POW camp. He was again recruited to service during the Korean War. After returning from Korea, he worked variously for the Knoxville Journal and in sales related to mobile homes and cable television. He died in 1985, having never received any official recognition, citation or medal for his defense of the Jewish POWs.Roddie Edmonds bio: \\"'We are all Jews',\\", Yad Vashem, at yadvashem.org, retrieved April 12, 2018  Posthumous recognition  As late as February 2017, Edmonds' act had never been recognized officially by the U.S. government.

Edmonds began researching his story, and stumbled upon a mention of the event at the POW camp. He located several of the Jewish soldiers his father saved, who provided witness statements to Yad Vashem. Among the Jewish- American POW servicemen who were saved was Sonny Fox, American television host and executive, who witnessed, and in interviews speaks of, Edmonds' actions. On 10 February 2015, Yad Vashem recognized Edmonds as \\"Righteous Among the Nations,\\" Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. The awards ceremony was held January 27, 2016, at the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C., where the then-President Barack Obama praised Edmonds for action \\"above and beyond the call of duty,\\" and echoed Edmonds' statement of solidarity with Jews.

The stream and dam called Totololo in Silobela area is 64 km southwest of Totororo Primary School. Totololo Dam is on coordinates -19.03331¬∞, 29.28333¬∞. Legend says the Silobela Totololo was named after Totololo Stream (also known as Klein-Buffels) in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa where the Mbalekelwa family originated. (There is a school named after the Mbalekelwa back in KwaZulu Natal. Klein-Buffels refers to a stream of petty pastures or patchy pastures. Buffel grass is usually the chief of pastures growing to taller than half a metre but here the grass seem to have a deficiency of some kind. 'Klein' is a German word meaning short, little, insignificant or petty, and 'Buffel'(s) is a type of grass used in South Africa for pasture and forage. The combination of 'klein' and 'buffels'; Klein-Buffels means that the stream has 'petty pastures' or small stature pastures which cattle breeders cannot rely upon. (Klein-Buffels may also refer to Short-Buffaloes but there are no such Buffaloes. Buffel is Afrikaans for Buffalo) Totololo is a Zulu slang for 'patchy pastures' and so Totololo Stream in Silobela has patchy Bufflo grass. When the Mathe-Mbalekelwa people settled in Zhombe East along the Munyati River they named this tributary Totololo because of the kind of pastures that grow along it. Totololo is a Ndebele word. In ChiShona language vocabulary there is no letter 'L', so the Shona people who are presently the majority in this area pronounce Totololo as Totororo, hence Totororo Stream, Totororo village and Totororo School. The Ndebele still pronounce the school name as 'Totololo' school because there is no 'r' in their vocabulary. Location The school is located along the gravel road Somalala-Sidakeni Road, a link road to the Kwekwe-Gokwe Highway. It is 64 km NWN of Kwekwe and 48 km SW of Kadoma by air.

Buckley, 271 U.S. 323 (1926), was a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1926 that ruled that the racially restrictive covenant of multiple residents on S Street NW, between 18th Street and New Hampshire Avenue in Washington, D.C., was a legally binding document which made the selling of a house to a black family a void contract.. This ruling set the precedent upholding racially restrictive covenants in Washington; soon after this ruling, racially restrictive covenants flourished around the nation. Background As a result of Buchanan v. Warley (1917), explicit government-instituted racial segregation could not be enforced, but neighborhoods were still very segregated. White homeowners lived mostly in suburban neighborhoods, while blacks occupied a great deal of the inner city. In the aftermath of Buchanan, other less explicit methods to force and maintain segregation were created, such as racially restrictive covenants. (Another tactic, exclusionary zoning that was not explicitly racial in description but maintained de facto racial segregation, was upheld in Euclid v. Ambler (1926).) These covenants were documents drawn up by members of a neighborhood, and stated that the signers would not sell their homes to any person that was nonwhite. The agreements were instituted on a private scale, so they had never had to face justification from the court system. Many citizens that signed the papers were afraid of blacks moving in and lowering their property values. The whites gave numerous reasons for how the exclusion of blacks was logical and understandable, but in the end the reasons were used as a fa√ßade to cover up the racism that was still prevalent at that time. Washington had always been a racially segregated city, and one such covenant was signed for the block on S Street NW between 18th Street and New Hampshire Avenue. The covenant signed by John J. Buckley and Irene H. Corrigan Case The case Corrigan v. Buckley resulted from an infringement upon a covenant. An agreement was made in 1921 by thirty white homeowners that none among them would sell, rent, or allow blacks to obtain their land by any means.\\"Constitutional Law. Covenant Prohibiting Sale of Property to Negro Is Constitutional.\\" Virginia Law Review 11, no. 1 (November 1924): 68-69. Accessed January 2016. JSTOR. In 1922 Irene Corrigan broke the restrictions put in place by the covenant. Corrigan sold her land to a black couple, Helen and Dr. Arthur Curtis. Corrigan vs. Buckley went through a five-year court case before finally being settled by the Supreme Court in 1926. Buckley and the offense hoped that since the covenant was a written and signed document that it would be considered viable in a court of law. Curtis and Corrigan \\"moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that the covenant deprived the negro of property without due process of law, abridged the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and denied him the equal protection of the law.\\" Corrigan and Curtis argued that not selling her house would be a violation of Curtis' civil rights, while Buckley argued that the contract was binding and that Corrigan had no right to break it. The District Supreme Court sided with Buckley, saying that legal segregation happened all around D.C. and was a legal practice. The D.C. Court of Appeals also sided with Buckley, saying that African Americans also had the ability to exclude others from the neighborhoods that they lived in so it didn't discriminate against them and thus didn't violate Curtis' civil rights.\\"Mapping Segregation.\\" PROLOGUE DC LLC. Accessed January 24, 2016. http://prologuedc.com/blog/mapping-segregation. Both courts used the landmark case of Plessy v. Ferguson to state their case which legalized segregation as long as the separate races had equal facilities. The NAACP lawyers kept the appeals process going to the Supreme Court. They cited that the racially restrictive covenants would \\"drive colored folk out of Washington.\\" Once again, the court sided with Buckley. Justice Sanford delivered the decision saying, \\"in the absence of any substantial constitutional or statutory question giving us jurisdiction of this appeal under the provisions of section 250 of the Judicial Code, we cannot determine upon the merits the contentions earnestly pressed by the defendants in this court that the indenture is not only void because contrary to public policy, but is also of such a discriminatory character that a court of equity will not lend its aid by enforcing the specific performance of the covenant.\\"\\"1920s‚Äì1948: Racially Restrictive Covenants.\\" 1920s‚Äì1948: Racially Restrictive Covenants. Accessed January 24, 2016. http://www.bostonfairhousing.org/timeline/1920s1948-Restrictive- Covenants.html. The ruling meant that the purchase that Curtis had made on the house was now void, and that the covenant was upheld. Consequences By upholding the dismissal of the case, the Supreme Court set the precedent that racially exclusive covenants were acceptable, and not prohibited by law.Shay, Allison. \\"On This Day: Corrigan v. Buckley and Housing Discrimination.\\" Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement RSS. May 24, 2012. Accessed January 24, 2016. This led to the spread of covenants throughout the D.C. area. In the years following the case, petition covenants quickly spread to many white neighborhoods in D.C. Hundreds of lots signed onto petition covenants in 1927, the year after Corrigan v. Buckley. The covenants were a non-federally mandated form of segregation, and the decision in the Corrigan v. Buckley case seemed to take a few steps back in the progress concerning black civil rights in the United States. One big impact of the Corrigan v. Buckley case was on the neighborhood on S Street NW where the covenant was originally signed by Corrigan and Buckley. Buckley was able to stop Helen Curtis from moving into No. 1727 on S Street. However, as the court case was being fought, Dr. Emmett J. Scott, a black man, moved into No. 1711 of S Street in April 1923. This caused a very quick migration of the white community out of the neighborhood. By 1934, the neighborhood had an 86% non-white population. This population shift showed the extreme effect that one African American could have on a neighborhood. Many neighborhoods shifted dramatically during this time, as many white people of D.C left the city for the suburbs. This \\"white flight\\", as it was coined, was often the result of an African American moving into a neighborhood that was almost completely inhabited by whites. The white people still living in these houses would fear that their property values would go down dramatically if they didn't sell right away and thus would move out to the suburbs as quickly as possible. The ramifications of the Corrigan v. Buckley case were felt throughout the D.C. area. The use of covenants spread rapidly, until almost entire neighborhoods were promised to be racially homogenous. Blacks now faced the possibility of lawsuits if they used loopholes to work around the housing restrictions. If some blacks did manage to sneak past the covenants and the occasionally racist sellers, and move into a home, it would often lead to a mass exodus of whites to other areas. The precedent that racial exclusion in terms of housing was acceptable lasted for a few decades before the issue was reconsidered by the judicial system. It wasn't until Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) that the Supreme Court determined that it was unconstitutional for the legal system to enforce covenants. Corrigan v. Buckley set the precedent that racially restrictive covenants were just, and it lasted for years.  See also  * Hansberry v.

She fought against prostitution and vice, working toward improving education and skills for the black community. Through efforts including operating a women's shelter, supporting Sunday Schools and attending conferences, she became a leader in the abolitionist community. After her former master's death, she returned to New Jersey and continued working to assist escaping slaves throughout the Civil War. Early life in Salem Amy Hester \\"Hetty\\" Reckless was born into slavery in Salem, New Jersey, in 1776, the daughter of Dorcas Boadley, who belonged to the wealthy Johnson family who lived in Johnson Hall. Initially, Reckless was the property of Jane Gibson Johnson and when she died became her son's chattel. When Colonel Robert Gibbon Johnson married for the second time, his wife Julianna mistreated Reckless. Fleeing to Philadelphia in 1826 with her daughter, Reckless sought help from the Abolition Society claiming at first that she had been emancipated by her previous owner. She recounted that she boarded a stagecoach like any other passenger and rode without question from Salem to Philadelphia, resolved not to return because Johnson's wife had knocked out her front teeth with a broomstick and yanked out tufts of her hair. She also was aggrieved because Johnson's mother had promised her she would receive her freedom, but when the Colonel inherited Reckless, he refused. Colonel Johnson tried to reclaim her as his slave, promising to set her free if she would return and give him her daughter. Reckless refused and did not return to Salem until after Johnson's death in 1850. Philadelphia and the campaign against slavery In Philadelphia, Reckless lived with Samuel and Eliza Clement, who were related to the Goodwins, the Quaker sisters who were pioneers of the Underground Railroad. Introduced to this circle, in 1833, Reckless became a founding member of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society (PFASS), along with Grace Bustill Douglass, Sarah Mapps Douglass, and Charlotte Forten Grimk√© with her daughters. Her cherished possessions included a photograph of the members of the PFASS and a flag with anti-slavery inscriptions. The PFASS was a racially integrated organization, but Reckless also worked with the predominantly-black Female Vigilant Association, which formed in 1838. This group was an auxiliary of the male Vigilant Association of Philadelphia, to which Reckless was appointed a full member in 1843. Of the fifteen committee members appointed to replace the previous board, Reckless served with the male appointees. Reckless liaised between these organizations for whom she was an enthusiastic and energetic campaigner. September 1841 minutes of the PFASS show Reckless reported that the Vigilance Committee had saved 35 slaves in a single month and recorded her plea for additional funds of support. Four years later she again was pleading for funds to assist fugitive slaves. Reckless also operated a safe house for the Underground Railroad on Rodman Street in Philadelphia. Her activities included supporting the establishment of Sabbath schools in the black community. Reckless felt it was important for the benevolent societies to support organizations which the African American community had created for themselves, but improve them with educational offerings. In 1838, Reckless attended the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, held in Philadelphia from 15‚Äì18 May. Reckless also participated in the \\"Convention of the Colored People\\" held in Philadelphia in 1840. Lucretia Mott attended this gathering, noting that African American women delegates were allowed to participate as equals in the meeting. Moral Reform Retreat Reckless was not only concerned with freeing women from slavery, but from sexual exploitation as well. In 1845, she and Hetty Burr co-founded the Moral Reform Retreat to shelter women \\"victims of vice\\". It was the only shelter for African American women in Philadelphia. The first two years alone, they housed over 200 women for periods of up to six months, providing shelter and education. The organization served the dual purpose of providing employment for the women who ran the shelter. Reckless introduced Sarah Mapps Douglass, who was from a more privileged class, to women's vulnerabilities to prostitution because of their illiteracy and lack of skills. Douglass was moved to invest funds in establishing the shelter and helped Reckless and Burr teach the women skills to broaden their economic alternatives. Return to Salem and death in Philadelphia After 1850, Reckless returned to Salem and continued her anti-slavery work, living on Market Street, near the old Johnson manor house. These activities continued through the American Civil War, when in a letter from 1862 from Abigail Goodwin to William Still, Goodwin reported that \\"Amy Reckless\\" collected $17 (more than any other contributor) and was collecting clothing for fugitives. By 1880, Reckless had returned to Philadelphia and was living with two of her daughters. She died at home on January 28, 1881. Her home was located at 1015 Rodman Street which is now in the Washington Square West district of central Philadelphia. She was aged almost 105 and left a daughter who was in her seventies. Her mind was quite sharp until the end and she was fond of recounting that she had seen George Washington more than once.

The only permanent member is frontman Dylan James, who writes the music and plays all the instruments on the studio records, while the other members back him up for live shows or music videos. The band is mainly known for their cover of \\"Let It Go\\" by Idina Menzel, which has been viewed, as of January 2016, over 865,000 times on the band's YouTube channel, and over 1,663,000 times on the music promoting YouTube channel Ghost Killer Entertainment, making it the most viewed video on both channels.  History =Formation and early years as Autumn Under Fire (2009‚Äì2010)= The Last Sleepless City was formed in the summer of 2009 under the name Autumn Under Fire. Dylan James had just seen Breathe Carolina performing on the Vans Warped Tour and he wanted to start a band in their style. He recruited his friend Allen Niles to scream and play the synthesizer, while he would be the singer and guitarist. The band released their debut EP, called Time To Take Cover on November 6, 2009. After releasing the EP, Dylan decided to find a new guitarist for Autumn Under Fire, so that he wouldn't have to play the guitar while singing during live shows. After recruiting Mitchell Willard for guitar duties, the band released another EP, called Crash The Scene. =Name change and lineup instability (2010‚Äì2012)= Mitchell Willard left the band in late 2010. Following his loss, Dylan and Allen started looking for people to replace him, and found Jake Smith, Tim Howell, Collin East and Tae Kim. With this six-member lineup, the band changed its name to The Last Sleepless City. As Autumn Under Fire songs had a very electronic sound, The Last Sleepless City would include more pop-punk aspects to their music. The band started working on a CD shortly after their name change, and played a live show for its release. On November 15, 2011, with a new five-member lineup, the band released an acoustic EP called Words To Say. In 2012, all the band members, except Dylan, left the band. =Ignite The Stars (2012‚Äì2014)= On December 1, 2012, with a new lineup consisting of Dylan with new members Guy Petrie, Evan Guffin, Juan Rodriguez and Cody Simmons, The Last Sleepless City released an EP called Ignite the Stars. The EP includes the song \\"Dreamers Never Die\\", which is the most popular song on the band's YouTube channel. Dylan says it is his \\"most meaningful song\\". Fans of the band are also dubbed \\"Dreamers\\". Following the departure of guitarist Guy Petrie in early 2013, The Last Sleepless City played mainly acoustic shows. The band also released a cover of \\"Jamie All Over\\" by Mayday Parade and an acoustic version of \\"Dreamers Never Die\\". =Recent activity (2014-present)= In 2013, all the band members, except Dylan, left The Last Sleepless City again. On February 25, 2014, with new members Joel VanWie, Julian Alexander, Logan Garcia and Jonathan Riley, the band released a cover of \\"Let It Go\\" by Idina Menzel. Following the release of this cover, Dylan started uploading a large number of solo covers. The Last Sleepless City also did two other band covers, one of \\"Feeling This\\" by blink-182 and one of \\"She Looks So Perfect\\" by 5 Seconds of Summer. On July 27, 2014, the band played at Warped Tour 2014. Due to guitarists Joel VanWie and Julian Alexander, and bassist Logan Garcia leaving the band shortly before Warped Tour, Benjamin Jimenez and Thomas Filbert filled in for this show. Since playing Warped Tour, The Last Sleepless City functioned as a solo act, with Dylan playing all the instruments along with providing vocals. The former Last Sleepless City members Mike Battista, Benjamin Jimenez and Jonathan Riley rejoined the band in mid-2015, in addition to new member Josh Grimes and several appear on the band's music video for the song \\"Big Ideas, Bigger Hearts\\", released on June 9, 2015. The Last Sleepless City is currently working on the band's upcoming album Constellations which is being produced by All Time Low drummer Rian Dawson.The first single Paperback was released on April 7, 2017. Musical style The band define their musical style as pop-punk and synth-pop. They also make use of breakdowns in their songs, with occasional screamed vocals, for example their song \\"Dreamers Never Die\\" features a breakdown with Kyle Burrier, from melodic hardcore band Secret Keeper, screaming.sleeplessdylan.tumblr.com/post/95062168104/wait-is-it-you-screaming- in-dreamers-never-die In their early days as Autumn Under Fire, the band played a much more electronic-oriented sound with frequent screaming from band member Allen Niles, a style that the band called \\"screamotronic\\".

The Ila are closely related in language and culture to their more numerous Tonga neighbours in Southern Province. The Ila people mainly reside in Namwala District, which is the principal town for the Ila, Itezhi-Tezhi and Mumbwa districts spread across seventeen chiefdoms. Most Ila grow enough food to feed their families and to cover expenses for physical needs and their children's educational expenses. More educational and career opportunities are available in the larger towns and village centers. Some Ila raise animals such as chickens, goats, or pigs on a small scale, and mostly cows, though that is usually for tradition and prestige. In fact, the belief that cows are a sign of wealth and value undergirds an Ila funeral tradition. The funeral ceremony lasts several days. On the day after burial, cows are slaughtered. It is believed that the more that are killed, the greater the value of the dead person in the eyes of the community. Afterward, everyone goes home with enough meat to compensate for the time spent at the funeral. Origin The Ila-speaking peoples and their neighbours on all sides belong to the Bantu subdivision of the Africans, and their ancestors in remote times must have come down from the southern Sudan. It may be judged from linguistic evidence, to separate lines of immigration. The Ba-ila in the main belong to the Eastern Bantu, and came into their present domain on the crest of a wave of emigration from the north-east, from the country around the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, where the Bantu found a new motherland, a second focus and radius of development. But they have were evidently influenced by, and to some extent intermixed with, peoples of another section, which, after passing from the north-east through the Congo territory towards the west coast, curled* back again towards the centre of the continent in a south-easterly direction. These statements are made on linguistic grounds. The closest affinities to Ila are found in a line of dialects stretching from the Subia on the Zambezi to the Bemba on Lake Tanganyika, and including midway the Tonga, Lenje, Bisa, and others. Many cult words, such as Leza (\\" the Supreme Being\\"), chisungu (\\"the pubertyrites\\"),are common to these dialects and are not known in the west ; while in Ila we have such words as tonda (\\" taboo\\"), evidently brought from the west (cf. the Kele word orunda), and ifuka (\\" nine \\"), the root of which (buka) is found only among the West African Bantu. The Ba-ila. According to themselves, the pucka Ba-ila their region, called Bwila, as defined by themselves and as delineated on the map, is a small one. Like most African tribal names, it is difficult to determine its meaning.The word Ila, standing alone, may mean several things : it is a verb, \\" to go to \\" or \\" go for,\\" and Ba-ila might mean \\" the people going off.\\" Ila also means \\" a distended intestine,\\" also \\" a grain of corn.\\" But none of these is satisfactory. Ila is also one form of the verb zhila, \\" be taboo, set apart,\\" corresponding to sacer, hagios,haram. It is an old Bantu root : Suto, ila ; Zulu, zila ; Ronga, yila ; Herero, zera ; Nyanja, yera ; Upper Congo, kila cf.Ganda, omuzira, a totem. It occurs also in some tribal names, e.g. Bashilange. \\" they who taboo the leopard.\\" This is, we think, the derivation of the name Ba-ila : \\" The people who are taboo, set apart \\" ; they are the Hagioi ; in short, the people.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a large polyp, colonial coral and grows under overhangs and in caves as part of an assemblage of organisms suited to these poorly-lit sites. Description Bleached and in vivo coral colonies of Polycyathus muellerae (right column: C,D). Scale bars: A, C = 1 cm; B, D = 0.5 cm. Polycyathus muellerae is a colonial species of coral with large polyps. The individual polyps are at first joined by an encrusting basal lamina but with time this may get worn away and other organisms may take up residence between the polyps. Growth in this species is achieved by budding from the basal lamina, and the rather diffuse colonies may be a metre or so in diameter. Each individual polyp sits in a corallite or stony cup, about in diameter and high. The corallites have up to four cycles of toothed septa (stony ridges) making 48 septa in total. Both corallites and polyps are brown and the tentacles, long, have white granulations and white cylindrical tips. Distribution and habitat This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. It normally avoids direct sunlight and grows in caves and under overhangs at depths of or less. Ecology P. muellerae is a non- zooxanthellate coral; it does not have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic dinoflagellates as do most corals, instead obtaining all its nutrition from the planktonic organisms caught by the polyps. Asexual reproduction by budding increases the size of the colony. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in this species, but the fact that the coral has a widespread distribution suggests that it is likely to occur. This coral is sometimes parasitized by the barnacle Megatrema anglicum. A study of the assemblages of organisms living in caves in southern Italy found that in the best-lit places near the entrance, algae were plentiful and in the deepest parts of the interior sponges predominated. In the intermediate zone there were corals including Polycyathus muellerae, hydroids, serpulid worms, bivalves, worm snails, bryozoans and sea squirts.

Members of the AE family are generally responsible for the transport of anions across cellular barriers, although their functions may vary. All of them exchange bicarbonate. Characterized protein members of the AE family are found in plants, animals, insects and yeast. Uncharacterized AE homologues may be present in bacteria (e.g., in Enterococcus faecium, 372 aas; gi 22992757; 29% identity in 90 residues). Animal AE proteins consist of homodimeric complexes of integral membrane proteins that vary in size from about 900 amino acyl residues to about 1250 residues. Their N-terminal hydrophilic domains may interact with cytoskeletal proteins and therefore play a cell structural role. Some of the currently characterized members of the AE family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database. Family overview Bicarbonate (HCO3 ‚àí) transport mechanisms are the principal regulators of pH in animal cells. Such transport also plays a vital role in acid-base movements in the stomach, pancreas, intestine, kidney, reproductive organs and the central nervous system. Functional studies have suggested different HCO3 ‚àí transport modes. * Anion exchanger proteins exchange HCO3 ‚àí for Cl‚àí in a reversible, electroneutral manner. * Na+/HCO3 ‚àí co-transport proteins mediate the coupled movement of Na+ and HCO3 ‚àí across plasma membranes, often in an electrogenic manner. Sequence analysis of the two families of HCO3 ‚àí transporters that have been cloned to date (the anion exchangers and Na+/HCO3 ‚àí co-transporters) reveals that they are homologous. This is not entirely unexpected, given that they both transport HCO3 ‚àí and are inhibited by a class of pharmacological agents called disulphonic stilbenes. They share around ~25-30% sequence identity, which is distributed along their entire sequence length, and have similar predicted membrane topologies, suggesting they have ~10 transmembrane (TM) domains. A conserved domain is found at the C terminus of many bicarbonate transport proteins. It is also found in some plant proteins responsible for boron transport. In these proteins it covers almost the entire length of the sequence. The Band 3 anion exchange proteins that exchange bicarbonate are the most abundant polypeptide in the red blood cell membrane, comprising 25% of the total membrane protein. The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 functions primarily as an anchoring site for other membrane-associated proteins. Included among the protein ligands of this domain are ankyrin, protein 4.2, protein 4.1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphofructokinase, aldolase, hemoglobin, hemichromes, and the protein tyrosine kinase (p72syk). Anion exchangers in humans In humans, anion exchangers fall under the solute carrier family 4 (SLC4) family, which is composed of 10 paralogous members (SLC4A1-5; SLC4A7-11). Nine encode proteins that transport HCO. Functionally, eight of these proteins fall into two major groups: three Cl-HCO exchangers (AE1-3) and five Na+-coupled HCO transporters (NBCe1, NBCe2, NBCn1, NBCn2, NDCBE). Two of the Na+-coupled transporters (NBCe1, NBCe2) are electrogenic; the other three Na+-coupled HCO transporters and all three AEs are electroneutral. Two others (AE4, SLC4A9 and BTR1, SLC4A11) are not characterized. Most, though not all, are inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS). SLC4 proteins play roles in acid-base homeostasis, transport of H+ or HCO by epithelia (e.g. absorption of HCO in the renal proximal tubule, secretion of HCO in the pancreatic duct), as well as the regulation of cell volume and intracellular pH. Based on their hydropathy plots all SLC4 proteins are hypothesized to share a similar topology in the cell membrane. They have relatively long cytoplasmic N-terminal domains composed of a few hundred to several hundred residues, followed by 10-14 transmembrane (TM) domains, and end with relatively short cytoplasmic C-terminal domains composed of ~30 to ~90 residues. Although the C-terminal domain comprises a small percentage of the size of the protein, this domain in some cases, has (i) binding motifs that may be important for protein-protein interactions (e.g., AE1, AE2, and NBCn1), (ii) is important for trafficking to the cell membrane (e.g., AE1 and NBCe1), and (iii) may provide sites for regulation of transporter function via protein kinase A phosphorylation (e.g., NBCe1). The SLC4 family comprises the following proteins. * SLC4A1 * SLC4A2 * SLC4A3 * SLC4A4 * SLC4A5 * SLC4A7 * SLC4A8 * SLC4A9 * SLC4A10 * SLC4A11 =Anion exchanger 1= The human anion exchanger 1 (AE1 or Band 3) binds carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) forming a \\"transport metabolon\\" as CAII binding activates AE1 transport activity about 10 fold. AE1 is also activated by interaction with glycophorin, which also functions to target it to the plasma membrane. The membrane-embedded C-terminal domains may each span the membrane 13-16 times. According to the model of Zhu et al. (2003), AE1 in humans spans the membrane 16 times, 13 times as Œ±-helix, and three times (TMSs 10, 11 and 14) possibly as Œ≤-strands. AE1 preferentially catalyzes anion exchange (antiport) reactions. Specific point mutations in human anion exchanger 1 (AE1) convert this electroneutral anion exchanger into a monovalent cation conductance. The same transport site within the AE1 spanning domain is involved in both anion exchange and cation transport. AE1 in human red blood cells has been shown to transport a variety of inorganic and organic anions. Divalent anions may be symported with H+. Additionally, it catalyzes flipping of several anionic amphipathic molecules such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and phosphatidic acid from one monolayer of the phospholipid bilayer to the other monolayer. The rate of flipping is sufficiently rapid to suggest that this AE1-catalyzed process is physiologically important in red blood cells and possibly in other animal tissues as well. Anionic phospholipids and fatty acids are likely to be natural substrates. However, the mere presence of TMSs enhances the rates of lipid flip-flop.  Structure  The crystal structure of AE1 (CTD) at 3.5 angstroms has been determined. The structure is locked in an outward-facing open conformation by an inhibitor. Comparing this structure with a substrate- bound structure of the uracil transporter UraA in an inward-facing conformation allowed identification of the likely anion-binding position in the AE1 (CTD), and led to proposal of a possible transport mechanism that could explain why selected mutations lead to disease. The 3-D structure confirmed that the AE family is a member of the APC superfamily. There are several crystal structures available for the AE1 protein in RCSB (links are also available in TCDB). :AE1: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , =Other members= Renal Na+:HCO cotransporters have been found to be members of the AE family. They catalyze the reabsorption of HCO in the renal proximal tubule in an electrogenic process that is inhibited by typical stilbene inhibitors of AE such as DIDS and SITS. They are also found in many other body tissues. At least two genes encode these symporters in any one mammal. A 10 TMS model has been presented, but this model conflicts with the 14 TMS model proposed for AE1. The transmembrane topology of the human pancreatic electrogenic Na+:HO transporter, NBC1, has been studied. A TMS topology with N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm has been suggested. An extracellular loop determines the stoichiometry of Na+-HCO cotransporters. In addition to the Na+-independent anion exchangers (AE1-3) and the Na+:HCO cotransporters (NBCs) (which may be either electroneutral or electrogenic), a Na+-driven HCO/Cl‚àí exchanger (NCBE) has been sequenced and characterized. It transports Na+ \\\\+ HCO preferentially in the inward direction and H+ \\\\+ Cl‚àí in the outward direction. This NCBE is widespread in mammalian tissues where it plays an important role in cytoplasmic alkalinization. For example, in pancreatic Œ≤-cells, it mediates a glucose-dependent rise in pH related to insulin secretion. Animal cells in tissue culture expressing the gene-encoding the ABC-type chloride channel protein CFTR (TC# 3.A.1.202.1) in the plasma membrane have been reported to exhibit cyclic AMP-dependent stimulation of AE activity. Regulation was independent of the Cl‚àí conductance function of CFTR, and mutations in the nucleotide-binding domain #2 of CFTR altered regulation independently of their effects on chloride channel activity. These observations may explain impaired HCO secretion in cystic fibrosis patients. Anion exchangers in plants and fungi Plants and yeast have anion transporters that in both the pericycle cells of plants and the plasma membrane of yeast cells export borate or boric acid (pKa = 9.2). In A. thaliana, boron is exported from pericycle cells into the root stellar apoplasm against a concentration gradient for uptake into the shoots. In S. cerevisiae, export is also against a concentration gradient. The yeast transporter recognizes HCO, I‚àí, Br‚àí, NO and Cl‚àí, which may be substrates. Tolerance to boron toxicity in cereals is known to be associated with reduced tissue accumulation of boron. Expression of genes from roots of boron-tolerant wheat and barley with high similarity to efflux transporters from Arabidopsis and rice lowered boron concentrations due to an efflux mechanism. The mechanism of energy coupling is not known, nor is it known if borate or boric acid is the substrate. Several possibilities (uniport, anion:anion exchange and anion:cation exchange) can account for the data. Transport reactions The physiologically relevant transport reaction catalyzed by anion exchangers of the AE family is: :Cl‚àí (in) + HCO (out) ‚áå Cl‚àí (out) + HCO (in). That for the Na+:HCO3- cotransporters is: :Na+ (out) + nHCO (out) ‚Üí Na+ (in) + nHCO (in).

He has been named as a candidate for beatification several times, beginning in the 1730s and most recently in 2009. A legend associated with Bernard was that he performed a miracle to restore water to the depleted well in the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski, Poland. The well provided the water for the town's brewery, which was the primary source of income for the town; without the income from the brewery, its residents were starving. In addition to healing everybody who drank from it, the new water source was reputed to make the beer produced by the town's brewery far superior to what it had been able to produce before, and led to hundreds of years of prosperity for the town and its residents.  Biography  Bernard was one of eight children of Pawe≈Ç Pƒôcharek, the mayor of WƒÖbrze≈∫no, and his wife Dorota of Sasin. He was born in early 1575 in WƒÖbrze≈∫no, in the province of Royal Prussia in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, although the exact date is not known because a fire destroyed the town's church records in about 1751. His date of birth is estimated to be within a few days of 3 February, based on statements of his older sister Elizabeth who testified under oath in 1645 about his age and baptism. After graduating from the parish school at the age of 12, he was sent by his father to the Jesuit College in Pozna≈Ñ. At the college, he gained distinction for his selfless love of his neighbors and his compassion for the sick and the poor. At the age of 24 he entered the novitiate in the Benedictine abbey in Lubi≈Ñ, where he soon became master of novices at an unusually young age due to his ability to relate to young people. His goal was to teach in a Catholic school even though it was a period of great turmoil in the church, with many parishes leaving the church and becoming protestant churches. Bernard lived in the abbey for four years. He advanced to the priesthood in 1602, but died on 2 June, 1603, probably of tuberculosis, in the odor of sanctity. According to written biographies, he often spent many hours in vigils and was always the first to prayer, and eager to perform hard work. He was remembered for his great love of the spiritual life. Beatification process After Bernard's death, many people came forward to testify of the miracles he had performed and that miracles had appeared at his grave. Starting in the 1730s, the Archbishop of Pozna≈Ñ began collecting materials to produce biographies and testimonies of the miracles of Bernard. After his death, the documents needed for the process of beatification were filed in Rome. However, many of the Vatican archives were lost during the occupation of Rome by Napoleon's Army in the late 1700s, including some of the testimonies of the bishops of Pozna≈Ñ. Further attempts were made in later years, but were interrupted during the Partitions of Poland, and the wars and occupations of Poland during the first and second world wars. In 1968, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Pozna≈Ñ, Antoni Baraniak, formed a historical commission to resume the process. However, due to the deaths of members of this and other committees, the work slowed. In the early 2000s, attempts to restart the process and collect the necessary documentation resulted in the initiation of the beatification process on 18 March 2009 in Pozna≈Ñ. Legacy Statue of Bernard of WƒÖbrze≈∫no in Grodzisk Wielkopolski One of the legends associated with father Bernard was that some time around 1603, he arrived in the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski from the Benedictine monastery in Lubi≈Ñ to find the residents starving and the town's wells depleted. The brewery was the primary source of income for the town and the hospital. Bernard prayed for the wells, and a new source of water suddenly filled the Old Market Well. Legends claimed that the newly refilled well had the ability to make whoever drank from it healthy again, and the beer that was produced from the water was far superior to any of the beer the brewers had been able to produce before. The well became a municipal treasure and was given credit for the commercial success of the town's breweries over the centuries to follow. Between the years 1620 and 1815, the residents of Grodzisk made an annual pilgrimage to Bernard's tomb, to bring a huge barrel of the beer that they made from the well as a show of gratitude. The tradition was resumed in 2003, on the urging of Henryk Szyma≈Ñski, the mayor of Grodzisk Wielkopolski. On 5 September 2009, the city unveiled a sculpture of Father Bernard, tall, next to the Old Market Well.

This was in stark contrast to work using EBs from mouse ESCs, which had shown some polarisation of gene expression in a small number of cases but no further development of the multicellular system. Following this study, the Martinez Arias laboratory in the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge demonstrated how aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were able to generate structures that exhibited collective behaviours with striking similarity to those during early development such as symmetry-breaking (in terms of gene expression), axial elongation and germ-layer specification. To quote from the original paper: \\"Altogether, these observations further emphasize the similarity between the processes that we have uncovered here and the events in the embryo. The movements are related to those of cells in gastrulating embryos and for this reason we term these aggregates ‚Äògastruloids‚Äô\\". As noted by the authors of this protocol, a crucial difference between this culture method and previous work with mouse EBs was the use of small numbers of cells which may be important for generating the correct length scale for patterning, and the use of culture conditions derived from directed differentiation of ESCs in adherent culture Brachyury (T/Bra), a gene which marks the primitive streak and the site of gastrulation, is up-regulated in the Gastruloids following a pulse of the Wnt/Œ≤-Catenin agonist CHIR99021 (Chi; other factors have also been tested) and becomes regionalised to the elongating tip of the Gastruloid. From or near the region expressing T/Bra, cells expressing the mesodermal marker tbx6 are extruded from the similar to cells in the gastrulating embryo; it is for this reason that these structures are called Gastruloids. Further studies revealed that the events that specify T/Bra expression in gastruloids mimic those in the embryo. After seven days gastruloids exhibit an organization very similar to a midgestation embryo with spatially organized primordia for all mesodermal (axial, paraxial, intermediate, cardiac, cranial and hematopoietic) and endodermal derivatives as well as the spinal cord. They also implement Hox gene expression with the spatiotemporal coordinates as the embryo. Gastruloids lack brain as well as extraembryonic tissues but characterisation of the cellular complexity of gastruloids at the level of single cell and spatial transcriptomics, reveals that they contain representatives of the three germ layers including neural crest, Primordial Germ cells and placodal primordia. A feature of gastruloids is a disconnect between the transcriptional programs and outlines and the morphogenesis. However, changes in the culture conditions can elicit morphogenesis, most significantly gastruloids have been shown to form somites and early cardiac structures. In addition, interactions between gastruloids and extraembryonic tissues promote an anterior, brain-like polarised tissue. Gastruloids have recently been obtained from human ESCs, which gives developmental biologists the ability to study early human development without needing human embryos. Importantly though, the human gastruloid model is not able to form a human embryo, meaning that is a non-intact, non-viable and non- equivalent to in vivo human embryos. Further reading Martinez Arias lab website article containing up-to-date information on the history, methods and current protocols on the culture of Gatruloids and their uses. The term Gastruloid has been expanded to include self-organised human embryonic stem cell arrangements on patterned (micro patterns) that mimic early patterning events in development; these arrangements should be referred to as 2D gastruloids.

Also called the Deutschsoziale Antisemitische Partei, the DSP had antisemitism as its ideological basis. Establishment The group was established in 1889 by Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, already widely known in anti-Semitic circles thanks to his Antisemites' Petition of 1880, his establishment of a short-lived string of discussion clubs called the Deutscher Volksverein and his prominence in the Berlin movement.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 422 The party contested the 1890 Reichstag election with Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg gaining their only seat. He remained a member of the house until his death in 1911. Ideology The group was strongly influenced by the thoughts of Adolf Stoecker but sought to take his ideas further.G√∂tz Aly, Why the Germans? Why the Jews?: Envy, Race Hatred, and the Prehistory of the Holocaust, Metropolitan Books, 2014, p. 81 Their programme of 1890 called for the \\"nullification of civil rights laws\\" as applied to Jews and for the passing of a new Jew law which would treat Jewish Germans as a new category of aliens.Christian Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, University of Michigan Press, 2012, p. 12 Its initial areas of activity were in Bochum and Erfurt.Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, p. 26 Vaguely anti-democratic, they sought the gradual elimination of parliament in favour of more of a trades-based system of representation, although these ideas were largely underdeveloped. The DSP also actively supported German colonial expansion, a common feature of contemporary German antisemitic rhetoric that emphasised economic autarky and lebensraum as bulwarks against the Jews.Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, p. 33 Wilhelm Lattmann, who represented the DSP in the Reichstag, became especially noted for pushing the party's imperialist agendaDavis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, p. 34 as well as his attacks on \\"race-mixing\\" in the colonies.Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, pp. 121-122 They also supported protectionism for German artisans, merchants and farmers and were opposed to the free market. Connections to other groups Although he personally disapproved of party politics, Theodor Fritsch was nonetheless attracted to the group's positions on the Jews and reprinted DSP propaganda in his journals.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 290 Through Fritsch the group also became close to Paul de Lagarde and asked him to run as a candidate for the Reichstag in 1889, an invitation he declined.Matthew Lange, Antisemitic Elements in the Critique of Capitalism in German Culture, 1850-1933, Peter Lang, 2007, p. 118 Fritsch would eventually split with the DSP, his occultist views being at odds with the DSP, which was firmly Christian in outlook.Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, p. 47 The DSP was very close to the German National Association of Commercial Employees, a white-collar workers union that was equally notorious for its anti-Jewish rhetoric.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 262 Willibald Hentschel, an influential writer who sought to promote the supremacy of the Aryan race, and who as such was subsequently seen as a progenitor of Nazism, served on the party's board of directors.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 297 Heinrich Pudor, the Volkish commentator and pioneer of nudism, was also loosely associated with the DSP, speaking at some of their functions.Davis, Colonialism, Antisemitism, and Germans of Jewish Descent in Imperial Germany, p. 123 One of a number of anti-Semitic parties active at the time, it merged with the German Reform Party (previously the Antisemitic People's Party) in 1894 to form the German Social Reform Party.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 22 This group was riven by splits and personality conflicts throughout its existence however and came to an end in 1900, when the DSP was re-established.Levy, Antisemitism, pp. 22-23 Liebermann von Sonnenberg clashed in particular with Oswald Zimmermann, another leading figure in the merged group.Robert Melson, Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust, University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 118 Differences had also been partially political, with the DSP considered the least radical of the antisemitic parties, with Friedrich Lange considering it alone as one of the \\"parties of order\\" during a failed attempt to forge a united party of the right.Geoff Eley, Reshaping the German Right: Radical Nationalism and Political Change After Bismarck, University of Michigan Press, 1991, p. 246 Later activity One of the DSP's centres of activity became Marburg, with the Reichstag seat won for the party in 1907 by Karl B√∂hme and by Johann Heinrich Rupp in 1912. The seat had previously been held by Otto B√∂ckel and Hellmut von Gerlach, both of whom were also associated with antisemitism.Rudy J. Koshar, Social Life, Local Politics, and Nazism: Marburg, 1880-1935, UNC Press Books, 2014, p. 71 In the Reichstag the DSP representatives collaborated closely with the Christian Social Party and the German Agrarian League.

Beginning her career as a teacher, after a brief period, Butterfield moved into nursing, earning her RGN and midwife certifications in Jamaica. After nearly a decade of nursing in the United States, she returned to Turks and Caicos and served as a clinic nurse for eight years before entering the family business. In the 1980s, she served on various public service boards before running for election in 1984. She was the first woman elected as part of the Legislative Assembly and after one term was continuously appointed to serve until 1991, when she became the first woman elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. After a three-year term as Speaker, she left public office to resume her duties as chief executive officer of the family firm and philanthropic efforts. Biography Rosita Beatrice Missick was born on 14 November 1936 in Kew, on North Caicos in the Turks and Caicos Islands to Savelitta A. (n√©e Higgs) and Isaiah V. Missick. She attended the Kew Elementary School and the Bottle Creek Elementary School before finishing her secondary education at Grand Turk Secondary School. Upon completion of her secondary schooling, Missick completed a workshop in Grand Turk to earn her teaching credentials and briefly taught at Kew Elementary School. Career=Nursing= In 1953, she changed direction and was hired at Grand Turk Hospital as part of the staff. Four years later, Missick received a scholarship and attended registered nursing training in Jamaica at the Kingston Public Hospital and the University College Hospital, now the University Hospital of the West Indies. She earned her qualification as a registered general nurse (RGN) and returned to Grand Turk Hospital for two years. Deciding to add midwifery training, Missick enrolled for training at Victoria Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. She graduated with a competency to deliver babies without doctor's supervision and honors, having earned the Matron's Prize, for best overall student; the Chief Surgeon's Prize, for the most efficient surgical student nurse; and the Evelyn Pierce Medical Nursing Book for night duty service excellence. On 22 March 1961, Missick married Albray V. Butterfield Sr. and the couple soon moved to Florida. Missick-Butterfield began working at Wuesthoff Hospital, as well as at the Sunny Pines Nursing Home, both in Rockledge, Florida. In addition to her work, she continued her education, completing her certification in psychiatric nursing at Daytona Beach Junior College in 1968. She also attended Brevard Junior College, studying business administration. They returned to the Turks and Caicos in 1971 and Butterfield accepted a position as nurse in charge of the Providenciales Clinic, until her retirement in 1978. In 1978, she became a director and secretary of the Butterfield Gold Group of Companies, a business started by her husband. Between 1982 and 1984, Butterfield served on the advisory committee of the Provo branch of the Immigration Committee, evaluating work permits for Providenciales Island. From 1983, she also served on various boards and committees for public welfare, including the Health Practitioner‚Äôs Board, Public Service Advisory Board, Turks and Caicos Tourist Board, and as a social worker for the Welfare Department. =Politics= In 1984, Butterfield became the first woman elected as a Member of Parliament in the Turks and Caicos, as a representative for the constituency of Kew, North Caicos. In 1986, she was appointed as Deputy Speaker of the House, serving until 1988. Between 1987 and 1988, she acted as chair of the Employment Bill Committee. In 1988, she became an appointed Member of Parliament (called the Legislative Assembly at that time), representing the Progressive National Party and served in that capacity until 1991, when she was elected as the first woman Speaker of the House. In 1992, Butterfield was the title of Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. Between 1991 and 1993, while she served Speaker, Butterfield also was a Justice of the Peace in the Turks and Caicos Islands and acted as president of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Turks and Caicos branch. After her term in politics ended, Butterfield returned to the family business, serving as chief executive officer. Private activities Butterfield served as Pastor of Faith Tabernacle Church Of God Turks and Caicos Islands and donated funds to build churches in Providenciales and North Caicos. She and her husband provided funds for the construction of a medical facility in Sandy Point, North Caicos. In addition to other philanthropic endeavors, Butterfield was involved in numerous activities related to education including providing scholarships, co-sponsoring the Inter-Island High School Spelling Bee, co-founding the Turks and Caicos Community College and founding the canteen of Clement Howell High School. She also founded the Soroptimist International club and established the Aglow International chapter in Providenciales. Butterfield died on 10 January 2015 at Doctor‚Äôs Hospital in Nassau, Bahamas and was given a state funeral on 5 February 2015 in Turks and Caicos.

Born in South Africa, she immigrated to America in the mid-Nineties after winning a green card in the Diversity Visa Lottery. She became a U.S. citizen in 2000. Gericke practiced law in South Africa, and California, working at Apple Computer, Borland, Logitech, and Scient Corporation. Gericke is President Emeritus of the Free State Project. In 2014, she won a landmark First Circuit Court of Appeals caselandmark First Circuit Court of Appeals case that affirmed the First Amendment right to film police officers. That same year, she was named one of New Hampshire Magazine's \\"2014 Remarkable Women\\" In 2016, Gericke ran as a Republican for New Hampshire State Senate in District 20 (Manchester Wards 3, 4, 10 and 11, and Goffstown), garnering 40% of the vote in the general election. In 2018, after a successful recount on a write-in campaign on the Libertarian Party's ballot, she ran as a fusion Republican/Libertarian candidate and received 42% of the vote, up two points in a year when District 20 swung 12-15% left due to the \\"Blue Wave.\\" In 2020, Gericke is again running as a Republican for New Hampshire State Senate in District 20. Early life Gericke was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to David (a South African diplomat) and Madalein Gericke. Because of her father's work, she traveled extensively as a child, living in the U.S., Sweden, and Brazil. Her political philosophy developed at a young age. Growing up in South Africa during the apartheid regime of the National Party, she opposed the government's authoritarian and racist policies. She studied law at the University of Pretoria from 1989 to 1993, graduating with a Baccalaureus Procurationis degree. After winning a green card in the Diversity Lottery, she moved to California with her husband. After passing the California Bar, she worked as in-house corporate counsel at Fortune 500 companies. In 2008, she received an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the City College of New York. Activism In February 2008, Gericke moved from New York City to New Hampshire for the Free State Project, a 501c3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to attract 20,000 liberty activists to New Hampshire. She organized the FSP's Porcupine Freedom Festival (colloquially known as \\"PorcFest\\") three times in 2009, 2010 and in 2020. She became the president of the FSP in 2011. In this capacity, she has appeared in the media, and was the driving force behind \\"triggering the move,\\" which occurred on 3 February 2016, when it was announced at a press conference that 20,000 people had signed the pledge. As president, she was very vocal in the media about promoting the Free State Project, and has appeared in outlets such as CNN, Forbes, The Economist, Wired, GQ, Mother Jones, The Washington Post, Fox News, NBC, and The New York Times. =Arrest and court case= On 24 March 2010, Gericke and others were en route in two cars to a friend's house when they were pulled over by police in the town of Weare, New Hampshire. She was advised she wasn't being pulled over, so she parked at a nearby school, and took out a video camera to film the interaction. Though the camera wasn't properly functioning, and she had announced to the officer that she was recording, a second officer approached her vehicle and demanded to see her camera. When she failed to hand it over, she was arrested. She was initially charged with disobeying a police officer and obstructing a government official. After an argument at the police station when the Weare PD refused to give her a receipt for her confiscated camera, she was also charged with unlawful interception of oral communications, a felony carrying a maximum 7-year sentence. All charges were dropped before going to trial. Gericke filed suit against the town and the officers, claiming in her pleadings that the officers' actions were \\"retaliatory prosecution in breach of her constitutional rights.\\" The case went to the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals. The defendants, the individual officers involved in the incident, the Town of Weare, and Weare Police Department, filed motions for summary judgment, claiming they had qualified immunity because there was no established right to film a traffic stop. The court denied the motions, ruling instead that the officers had no reasonable expectation to privacy while performing their duties in public. Based on a previous ruling, Glik v. Cunniffe, the court found that Gericke's right to film the officers was established at the time of her arrest. Furthermore, the Appeals Court found that Gericke's First Amendment rights had been violated and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. The case was settled for $57,500. Regarding the outcome, Gericke said: =Concord BEARCAT= In 2013, after a nationwide project about police militarization by the ACLU, it was discovered that the Concord Police Department had fraudulently referred to Free Staters as domestic terrorists in a federal grant application to the United States Department of Homeland Security for a Lenco BearCat, stating: Gericke responded by saying: When the matter was brought before Concord's City Council, the issue was tabled after many residents came out to voice their opposition to the city's purchase of such a vehicle. Gericke and other activists led a campaign to stop the city from accepting the money based on false claims. In the end, the council voted to accept the grant and buy the BearCat. However, John Duvall, Concord's Chief of Police, did resign after the incident. =Manchester lockdowns= On Friday, 13 May 2016, an entire neighborhood on the west side of Manchester, New Hamphire, where Gericke is a homeowner, was placed under lockdown with a shelter-in-place \\"order\\" when two officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries during a manhunt. The lockdown started and continued for more than five hours after the suspect had been apprehended. According to a Union Leader op-ed, the neighborhood \\"felt like a city under siege.\\" Several schools were closed for the whole day, and streets were cordoned off until 3pm, with residents unable to access their cars and thus unable to move freely or go to work. Heavily armed law enforcement officials with automatic weapons and police dogs patrolled the streets and searched cars, trash cans, and yards as helicopters circled overhead. On 7 June 2016, Gericke organized a rally at Manchester City Hall, saying in a press release prior to the event: Gericke addressed about 60 people during the rally to highlight what organizers said was a growing militarization of city police. Signs read \\"More Mayberry, Less Fallujah,\\" \\"Lock Downs are for Prisons,\\" and \\"Free People Move Freely.\\" In her speech Gericke said: Gericke continues to monitor police militarization, lockdowns, and SWAT raids in the City of Manchester and throughout New Hampshire. =ACLU-NH Surveillance Camera Lawsuit= In 2019, the ACLU-NH acting on behalf of several plaintiffs, including Gericke, filed an injunction against the City of Manchester to try to stop high-resolution night-vision surveillance cameras from being permanently installed downtown. =ReOpen NH Rallies= Gericke was an early critic of Governor Sununu's lockdown and stay-at-home orders issued in response to the C-19 virus, saying in NH Journal on 21 April 2020, \\"Freedom is the answer, what‚Äôs the question? It is possible to be concerned about the virus, and the economic downturn and the destruction of our civil liberties. I am, which is why I attended the rally on Saturday. I don‚Äôt underestimate the virus, but I also don‚Äôt underestimate the cost of the shutdown or the dangers of trading liberty for a false sense of security.\\"https://www.insidesources.com/point-we-are-all-essential-its-time- to-reopen-nh/ Gericke spoke at several ReOpen NH rallies in Concord and across the state, receiving death wishes and threats in response.

It is 64 km northwest of Kwekwe and 77 km southeast of Gokwe Centre. This small rural town center is the hub of both Zhombe Communal Land and Zhombe Central Ward. Name Joel Business Centre, in Zhombe Central ward, is named in honour of Joel Tessa, one of the pioneer businessmen at the centre during the 1960s. Tessa was one of the first shop owners at Zhombe Centre, also known as Zhombe Growth Point or Zhombe Joel. He is thought to have died during the Rhodesian bush war in the late 1960s. =Joel Tessa's role in the liberation war= There was a restriction or detention camp for suspected and proven influential political activists called Sikombela, north of Zhombe centre, which had been established in June 1965. It was mainly a detention camp for cadres aligned to ZANU. This camp is now a national monument. Joel Tessa is known to have collaborated with the Sikombela inmates and served as a courier of top secret errands. Edson Muzite refers to him as \\"Jewel\\", a Rhodesia Bush War collaborator; a mujibha as they were called. Edison Mzite is one of the less prominent ex-detainees of Sikombela Restriction Camp Muzite credits Joel Tessa as a comrade in arms as far as top secrecy is concerned. Local people say war collaborators like Joel Tessa were not easily detected by the then security forces because Sikombela Restriction Camp was deep in Mapfungautsi State Forest where predators were rife and no one would dare visit the camp at will. War collaborators took advantage of the weakness of the security forces in this area and they worked well with the inmates at Sikombela. Local people supporting the liberation war visited the restriction camp regularly, the authorities seemingly allowing frequent interaction at first. It was however not long before the authorities suspected foul play and stiffened conditions. Joel is thought to have been caught up by the Rhodesian Intelligence when their suspicions were aroused about activities at Sikombela Restriction Camp. Many war collaborators during the bush war disappeared from the public and many have never been traced. Edison Sithole and his secretary Miriam MhlangaEdson Sithole, Pindula, retrieved 26 January 2016 were some of the people whose whereabouts remain unknown. Their death is only an assumption. Joel Tessa, a less prominent figure in politics then, is assumed to have met with the same fate, for he has not been heard of since the days of the Sikombela Declaration Dossier. Municipality Zibagwe Rural District Council runs this centre. It is represented by a male (Ward 10) councillor on a Zanu-PF ticket. In council books Joel Business Center is named Zhombe and classified as a district service centre. Schools * Rio Tinto Zhombe High SchoolParlzim Zhombe Constituency 2006. pp12. Diagram1.

Born into an established, middle-class family in Washington D.C., Cook was believed to be D.C.'s richest black resident in 1895 with a net worth of over two hundred thousand dollars. As a civilian and in government, Cook championed civil rights causes aimed at uplifting D.C.'s black community, mainly through education, community engagement, and political activism. Cook was also a staunch opponent of Jim Crow laws, the Colonization movement, and other causes designed to put African Americans at the fringes of American life. Early life and education John Francis Cook Jr. was born in September 1833 to one of Washington D.C.'s most wealthy and distinguished African-American families. His father, John Francis Cook Sr. (1810-1855), was born a slave in the Washington DC area. At 16 years old, Cook Sr.'s industrious aunt, Alethia \\"Lethe\\" Tanner, bought him, his mother and several of his siblings freedom for $1,450. Cook Sr. went on to become a prominent figure in Washington D.C.'s religious and educational community for freed blacks. Among other things, Cook Sr. led Union Seminary, a school for black students in D.C., founded the Young Man's Moral and Literary Society, an antebellum abolitionist debating society for free and enslaved blacks, and co- founded Union Bethel Church. Cook Sr. also founded the Fifteenth Street Colored Presbyterian Church in Washington, DC and served from 1843 to 1855. John F. Cook Jr.'s mother, Jane Mann, was the daughter of Rachel Mann who was 'full-blood' Native American and Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke. Cook Jr. was first educated at Union Seminary while his father was the headmaster. He attended Oberlin College in Ohio at the age of twenty with his younger brother, George F.T. Cook (1835‚Äì1912), from 1853‚Äì1855. Cook Jr. and George left Oberlin before finishing their undergraduate studies and returned to D.C. in 1855 at the news of their father's death.  Career = Education = Upon returning to Washington, D.C. in 1855, Cook became the head of Union Seminary, replacing his late father. Cook led Union Seminary until 1857 when his younger brother, George, succeeded him. Though no longer in charge, Cook remained active in Union Seminary until its closure in 1867, the same year public schools were opened for black children. During that ten-year period, Cook continued teaching, even doing so at a great personal risk. In 1859, he was warned by government officials in D.C. that if he were to continue teaching black students, he would be arrested. This prompted Cook to move to New Orleans where he opened a school for black students and continued to teach. After a few years, however, he caught the attention local authorities and was issued a similar warning. By that time, the threat had subsided in D.C., and Cook returned to embark on a long and illustrious career in politics and activism. Returning to D.C. in 1862, Cook recognized a shortage of schools in D.C. as a result of the increased population during the Civil War. He erected a school for black children and named it after his father, the late John F. Cook. A lifelong educator like his father, Cook was also on the board of trustees and executive committee for Howard University (1875-1910) and served on the District's Board of Education (1906-1910). = Politics and public service = Following the closure of Union Seminary, Cook entered local government‚Äîand local politics soon after. In 1867, he began a clerkship in the office of the District tax collector. He would later be appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to be D.C.'s chief tax collector, serving for ten years from 1874 to 1884. In 1868, Cook was elected to the Board of Aldermen in the second elections in which black residents could vote. In 1869, Cook was appointed as a Justice of the Peace and served as such until 1876. In 1868, Cook began to get involved in local Republican politics, utilizing his wealth and connections to gain influence. Cook served as the District's delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1872 and 1880. Cook was also appointed to be D.C.'s Jury Commissioner in 1889 and was a member of the Board of Children's Guardians from 1892 to his death in 1910. = Political activism = Cook's social and political activism and influence was not limited to his work within government; he was a committed community organizer and activist in the black community and beyond. Cook was a trustee for many cultural and philanthropic institutions throughout his adult life, including the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association, the Home for Destitute Women and Children, and the Coleridge-Taylor Musical Society, among others. These institutions, in tandem with Cook's educational and political efforts, strived to enrich African-American culture and uplift the black community of D.C. However, Cook also had to expend his effort, money, and political influence to battle dangerous and discriminatory laws and practices against the black community. In response to the Colonization Movement‚Äîwhich proposed (and executed) the practice of transporting former slaves and free blacks to colonies in Africa and South America‚Äî, Cook helped launch the Social, Civil, and Statistical Association, a group of elite black Washingtonians who opposed colonization. Cook and two other members of the SCSA were in a committee of five African-Americans who on August 14, 1862 addressed an unimpressed President Lincoln on the subject‚ÄîLincoln being an advocate of colonization. While unsuccessful in their attempts to dissuade the President from his plans, the visit marked the first time an all-black delegation had the opportunity to address the President. However, Cook was wary about \\"taking the responsibility of answering the President on a matter in which more than four million of his people were concerned.\\" The delegation included Cook, Benjamin McCoy, John T. Costin, Cornelius Clark, and chaired by Edward Thomas. Cook, Thomas and Clark were SCSA members. Cook was one of the leaders of the First Ward Civil Rights Association, and he helped to get a petition signed by 2,500 citizens and into Congress to be debated, which pushed for democratic representation and the boycotting of many segregated white establishments. Cook was also a vocal critic of Jim Crow laws and used his political influence to stifle their presence in D.C. Following the Emancipation Proclamation, Cook and other elite, black Washingtonians harbored fears that the influx of former slaves to D.C. would reverse much of the black community's progress. Despite these concerns, Cook presided over a July 4 parade that many freed blacks attended, celebrating the Emancipation Proclamation, the Union Army's victory, and the passing of the 13th Amendment. = Freemasonry = John F. Cook Jr. was very active in African American Freemasonry (also known as Prince Hall Affiliation) in Washington, DC. Cook was made a Freemason in Eureka Lodge #5. After serving as Worshipful Master of his lodge he was eventually elected Grand Secretary and then Grand Master of what was then known as the Union Grand Lodge (Now known as the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia) in 1866. John F. Cook Jr. would be the longest serving Grand Master in his masonic jurisdictions history. In 1871, John F. Cook Jr. oversaw the severance of ties between his Grand Lodge and the National Grand Lodge (Compact). John F. Cook Lodge #10 in Washington, DC is named in his honor.  Personal life  John F. Cook Jr. was married to Helen Appo Cook (1837-1913), and together they had five children: Elizabeth Appo, John Francis III, George Frederick, Charles Chaveau, and Ralph Victor. Helen Appo was a prominent and influential activist in her own right. She helped found the National Colored Women's League and served as its president for decades. With his inheritance, Cook made real estate investments, and in 1895 he was reported to be D.C's wealthiest black resident, worth over two hundred thousand dollars. Due to this wealth, in addition to his political power, Cook and his wife repeatedly appeared on D.C.'s \\"elite black 400,\\" a list of prominent African-American socialites. His wealth and high social standing drew criticism from other blacks, and he did not earn the respect of many whites. Wealthy whites believed that Cook was trying to create an aristocratic society of wealthy blacks who, \\"clamored for admission to the theatres on the white level,\\" and believed they were worthy of the same respect as whites. Low to middle-class blacks believed that Cook only cared about the wealthy blacks, and could not identify with him, as they believed he was only concerned with the elite black community. Cook also served for ten years as Grand Master of what is now the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia (MWPHGLDC). He was a Worshipful Master of Eureka Lodge #5, one the oldest and most prestigious Free Masonry lodges in D.C. Cook also served many years on the board of trustees for the Columbian Harmony Society, which owned one of the largest African American cemeteries in Washington, D.C. Cook was buried at Columbian Harmony Cemetery, and later, his wife, Helen Appo Cook, and other Cook family members.  Legacy  John F. Cook Jr. dedicated his life to the advancement of the black community in Washington D.C. As an educator, politician, activist, and philanthropist, Cook promoted political and cultural causes, tasked with uplifting D.C.'s African American community, in addition to fighting racist and discriminatory policies and practices. And as a member of Washingtonian's black elite, Cook demonstrated living proof that a black man in 19th century United States could infiltrate the three main spheres of influence in American life: the political, the social, and the economic.

Hayes returned to his family's home in Fremont, Ohio in 1882 and went to work for the Fremont Savings Bank. Soon after he returned to Fremont, Hayes became a Trustee of the Birchard Library which was founded by his great uncle, Sardis Birchard. He introduced several progressive ideas to its management including the introduction of a children's area and sending boxes of books were sent to neighboring towns (similar to today's bookmobiles) and he published the library's catalog as installments in a local paper. He was one of the founders of the Ohio Library Association in 1895 and advocated for a bill in the legislature to appointment a state library commission. Hayes was appointed to the Ohio Library Commission in 1896. Hayes left Ohio for Chicago, Illinois where he worked on library issues and developed a traveling library. He then moved to Asheville, North Carolina where he acquired large holdings of land and worked with Asheville resident Edward W. Pearson to develop African American neighborhoods in West Asheville. In North Carolina, Hayes engaged in scientific farming on a large scale. Hayes was President of the Appalachian Forest Reserve and the western North Carolina Fair. He moved to Clearwater, Florida, in 1922. In Florida, he served as chairman of the board of directors of the Clearwater Savings and Loan Association and the First Mortgage Investment Company. Throughout his life he maintained his interest in library matters, promoting those of Asheville and Clearwater and retaining his membership on the board of trustees of the library in Fremont, Ohio.

It was built shortly after the Second World War. The first MAZ model (MAZ-200) used General Motors designed 2-stroke engines. Later on their own original engines were developed and implemented in the MAZ-500 series. Not only the plant itself, but the entire living infrastructure were built in a short time. Apartment buildings, shops, medical clinics, cinemas etc. were built in close proximity to the MAZ plant, providing plant workers with local (though limited) necessities. On many of the construction sites German prisoners of war were working together with Belarusian construction workers. The majority of these buildings are still in service today. It manufactures heavy-duty trucks, buses, trolleybuses, road tractors and semi- trailers for semi-trailer trucks, and cranes. MAZ was, and possibly is, the world's largest manufacturer of TELs (Transporter-Erector-Launchers) for many of the world's mobile ballistic missiles, from the widely proliferated MAZ-543 used to carry and launch the Scud B through to the recent Topol M's impressive 8-axle TEL. At the end of Soviet times, MAZ was the largest manufacturer of heavy trucks in the Soviet Union, and the only one for some truck categories. After the Soviet Union dissolved, MAZ production was reduced substantially, as has happened with many enterprises in the ultra-industrialized Belarus, oriented on the needs of a very big country. The previously mentioned production of public transport vehicles was a result of following diversification of the company. Among other recent products, MAZ city buses (see pictures below) are operating throughout Belarus, as well as in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Estonia. In Serbia, working in cooperation with a local-based company BIK (Bus industries Kragujevac), a production of gas-powered buses named BIK-203 has been agreed, which are based on the platform of MAZ-203 model.Gas-powered bus from Kragujevac at ekapija.rs, 20-4-2009MAZ-BIK 203 at Vuloviƒá Transport official website These buses have been delivered at several Serbian towns to be in use in public transportation companies. In 1997, together with \\"MAN\\", a joint Belarusian- German company JSC \\"MAZ-MAN\\", Minsk was set up, which by 1998 had established full-scale production of heavy vehicles, using the F90 MAN cabs introduced 1986 and replaced 1994. Production of truck cabs involves huge, expensive tools, making this kind of recycling an existing design attractive. While production of tractors for international trade with 4x2 and 6x4 chassis layouts was a stated goal, development of exhaust gas regulations within the EU turned this into illusion. Based on the MAZ-MAN they have produced concrete mixers, fueling vehicles, flatbed trucks, dump trucks, front-end loaders etc. Production of the Belarusian-German company demonstrated the advantage of technology created by combining the abilities and experience of auto makers of two countries. Compared to European models in the same class and quality range, MAZ-MAN products are on average 30% cheaper. Currently 98% of MAZ-MAN comply with Euro-3, while sale to the EU would require Euro-5 at least, Euro-6 by 2014. In 2004, the joint venture made 272 vehicles, which is 45% higher than 2003. At the same time in 2003, output in comparison with 2002 increased by 50%. 28 November 2005 MAZ-MAN sold 1000 of the first MAZ-MAN tractor to customers. =MoAZ= MOAZ-6014 Scraper in Togliatti Technical museum.

It was located in Abchak near the city of Minsk in Belarus. Ford has invested a capital of US$10.000.000 for building this plant. So it was the most expensive plant of the Ford concern in Western Europe at this time. The company existed from 1997 up to 2000 when it was closed due to low sales. The Ford Union was not a manufacturer, it was only an assembler of SKD kits. The vehicles assembled by the Belarusian plant can be identified by the manufacturer code Y4F on the start on the VIN and an R on the eleventh position for the plant identification. The plant become well-known on 23 July 1997 as president Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko was invited to a press conference with five strategically selected foreign journalists to discuss a predicted failure which later proved true.

He showed great promise as a two-year-old in 1976 when he won two of his three races including the Group One William Hill Futurity. In the following year he ran poorly when strongly-fancied for the 2000 Guineas but won the March Stakes and finished second in both the Craven Stakes and the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. He failed to win in four races in 1978 and was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Brazil. Background Sporting Yankee was a \\"tall\\" bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right foreleg bred in Kentucky by Nelson Bunker Hunt. His sire, Vaguely Noble, won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery. Sporting Yankee's dam Sale Day was a top-class racemare who won the Spinster Stakes in 1968 and produced several other winners including the Yellow Ribbon Stakes winner Amazer. She was also a sister of Hurry to Market the American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse of 1963. As a yearling Sporting Yankee was offered for sale and auctioned for $90,000 by representatives of the British bookmaking firm William Hill Racing. He was sent to race in England where he was trained at Lambourn by Peter Walwyn. Until 1975, British racehorses did not allow horse names which advertised companies: the relaxation of the rules allowed the colt to be named to promote the Yankee, a popular four-horse combination bet offered by UK bookmakers. Racing career=1976: two-year-old season= Sporting Yankee began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse in early October in which he overcame an unfavourable draw to finish second to Sin Timon, a colt who went on to win the Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1977. In the Chesterton Maiden Stakes over the same course and distance two weeks later he drew away from his twenty-six opponents in the last quarter mile to win by four lengths. At the end of October, the colt was moved up sharply in class for the William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. The race had previously been known as the Timeform Gold Cup and the Observer Gold Cup before Sporting Yankee's owner took over the sponsorship in 1976. Ridden by Pat Eddery and racing on very soft ground he started at odds of 9/2 against five opponents headed by the Vincent O'Brien-trained Valinsky who was made the odds on favourite after winning his only previous start in Ireland by five lengths. The other four runners were Orchestra (winner of the Beresford Stakes), Juge de Paix (runner-up in the Prix La Rochette) and the 66/1 outsiders Sultan's Ruby and Atwood. Sporting Yankee took an early lead, then settled into second behind Sultan's Roby before moving back to the front at half way. He stayed on strongly in the straight to win by two lengths from Sultan's Ruby with a gap of four lengths back to Orchestra in third. =1977: three-year-old season= On his three- year-old debut Sporting Yankee contested the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over one mile at Newmarket in April. He was beaten a head by the Guy Harwood-trained Limone, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. In the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance he started joint-second favourite behind The Minstrel, but finished unplaced in a race won by Nebbiolo. He was then moved up in distance for the Predominate Stakes over a mile and a half at Goodwood Racecourse in May and finished fourth behind Royal Blend. After a break of almost three months, Sporting Yankee returned in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in August in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. He was beaten two lengths into second by Valinsky with the four-year-old Norfolk Air in third place. Later in the month he faced only two opponents in the March Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Goodwood and recorded his only success of the year, beating the Barry Hills-trained Crown Bowler by four lengths. On his final appearance of the season the colt was sent to France for the Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he started a 28/1 outsider and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Rex Magna. =1978: four-year- old season= Sporting Yankee remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover his best form. He finished third to Orchestra in the John Porter Stakes on his seasonal debut but ran unplaced in three subsequent races and was retired at the end of the season. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland, and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Sporting Yankee was given top-weight of 116 pounds, seventeen pounds behind the top-rated J O Tobin. The independent Timeform organisation were more impressed, giving him a rating of 123, making him seven pounds inferior to J O Tobin and eight behind the French champion Blushing Groom. In their annual Racehorses of 1976 Timeform described him as a \\"rather weak and gangling\\" juvenile who was likely to improve as he matured. Timeform gave him a rating of 117 in 1977 and 100 in 1978. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Sporting Yankee was exported to Brazil to become a breeding stallion. His last recorded foals were born in 1985.

(MZ) is an American privately held technology company, founded in 2008 and based in Palo Alto, California. The company is best known for its widely advertised freemium mobile MMO strategy games Game of War: Fire Age and Mobile Strike, which have both simultaneously been ranked among the top ten highest-grossing mobile games. History=Origin and first products (2008‚Äì2012)= The company, which was originally called Addmired, was founded in 2008. In 2012, Addmired changed its name to Machine Zone, after raising $8 million in funding from Menlo Ventures. Gabriel Leydon founded the company with partners Mike Sherrill and current Chief Technology Officer Halbert Nakagawa. It was among the participants in Y Combinator's Winter 2008 Accelerator program for startups. The company got its start making AddHer and AddHim, a pair of MySpace widgets that TechCrunch called \\"a Hot or Not-esque social network plugin.\\" Addmired later pivoted into the free-to-play game space, releasing 13 games between 2009 and 2012, including the iOS games Original Gangstaz, iMob and iMob 2, and Global War Riot. =Breakout games (2012‚Äì2015)= Machine Zone released Game of War: Fire Age in October 2012 in New Zealand and Australia. According to VentureBeat, Leydon had used the 2012 venture funding to \\"bet everything on Game of War,\\" putting a team of 80 people on an 18-month project to design and build a complex real-time strategy game, including creation of a messaging infrastructure and language translation layer that would allow worldwide participation in the game's alliances and chat. The company launched Mobile Strike, a modern warfare game, in November 2015. In an advertising campaign that featured Arnold Schwarzenegger, the game was marketed as a product of a company called Epic War, later revealed to be a development studio of Machine Zone. =Rebranding (2016‚Äì2017)= The company rebranded itself as MZ in 2016. That year, a funding round valued the company at $5 billion. In April 2016, simultaneously with rebranding itself as MZ, the company announced the launch of a new platform as a service, leveraging the cloud-based networking infrastructure of its real-time gaming platform. Using the existing technology developed to monitor hundreds of thousands of players in its real-time mobile games, the company developed and demonstrated a system for the government of New Zealand that included applications to view and manage public transportation more efficiently, including an ability to provide timely information, down to the second, on bus and train movements. In November 2016, Machine Zone announced that it was partnering with Square Enix to develop a Final Fantasy XV mobile MMO. Through a subsidiary company, Epic Action LLC, Machine Zone released Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire in June 2017. =Refocus on gaming (2018‚Äìpresent)= In June 2018, MZ's board of directors replaced founder and CEO Gabe Leydon in order to refocus the company on gaming. Leydon had announced in March 2018 that MZ was working with Hedera Hashgraph on a distributed cryptocurrency technology called hashgraph, a blockchain alternative. According to Fast Company, Leydon left the company \\"ostensibly to run Satori\\", part of MZ's platform business since early 2017, as a spinoff \\"standalone business\\" focusing on the hashgraph project. Kristen Dumont, an attorney who had been the company's chief operating officer since 2015, replaced Leydon as CEO. In a July 2018 restructuring, Dumont laid off a large portion of Machine Zone's marketing team, approximately 125 jobs. In October 2018, TechCrunch named the company the sixth most successful company from Y Combinator. By the end of that year, after hiring Dan Nash as its chief financial officer, MZ had raised around $720 million in a new round of funding, with investors including JP Morgan, Anthos Capital, and Menlo Ventures. MZ released one game in 2018, World War Rising. Described by Pocket Gamer as \\"effectively a reskin of the developer's previously successful 4X strategy games\\", the new title offered a military-themed interface depicting armies from World War I to the modern era. The game, which was reportedly \\"stealthily launched\\" sometime before the end of August 2018, was identified as a product of Mobile War LLC rather than MZ. While Dumont confirmed MZ's ownership of the game during a tech conference in November 2018, World War Rising did not appear on MZ's website until at least May 2019. Marketing Kate Upton in 2014, promoting Game of War in costume as Athena. Approximately $40 million was spent on marketing Game of War: Fire Age in 2014. Along with advertisements in digital and social media, television commercials were produced featuring model Kate Upton as the goddess Athena. The ads highlighted Upton's sex appeal as she led battles in fantasy settings that were compared to those in Game of Thrones. The spots were introduced in the United States during an NFL Thursday Night Football game and were aired prominently during Super Bowl games and other sports events. Singer Mariah Carey replaced Upton, in late 2015, as the face of the game's advertising campaign. In September 2015, the first commercial featuring a brief clip of Carey as Athena was previewed by TMZ. Carey's agreement reportedly included \\"a seven-figure pay check; a 30-second commercial filmed by Alan Taylor ... and the use of her music in future promotional material.\\" In February 2016, MZ spent an estimated three times more on television advertising than any other mobile gaming company, including spending an estimated $10.7 million on 3,265 airings of its Super Bowl 50 ad for Mobile Strike featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. CEO Kristin Dumont, in a November 2018 interview with Fast Company, signaled a change in marketing strategy that would be unlikely to include future Super Bowl advertising. Dumont stated a preference for marketing with \\"more measurable results\\", and called television advertising \\"kind of a rip-off, to be honest\\". Game revenue and player purchases In August 2015, a former employee of Machine Zone was arrested and charged with stealing proprietary data that included \\"player spending habits broken down by time, location, age and other characteristics\\" which showed, for example, \\"which in-game items generate the most revenue and where in the game players often quit.\\" The monetary value of the data was linked by the Wall Street Journal to the fact that \\"about 3% of mobile-game players buy virtual goodies, such as extra turns and special powers. Most spend only a few dollars a month, while a tiny fraction known as whales ‚Äì a name derived from casinos ‚Äì plunk down $50 or more a month.\\" Analytics by Slice Intelligence indicated that Game of Wars paying players each spent an average of $550 in 2015 on its in-app purchases, compared to $87 spent by the average player of mobile free-to-play games. In March 2017, the company defeated a class action lawsuit on the basis that players who had sought damages for lost \\"virtual gold\\" at a virtual casino in Game of War \\"did not lose real money\\", according to the court.

It ranks among the finest works of Late Gothic sculpture in Bohemia. The anonymous artist, who is called the \\"Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation of Christ\\" after this work, probably had his workshop in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice and could have been the same person as the woodcarver Alexandr (Alexandr Schniczer) who was in charge of that town's guild between 1503 and 1516.Fajt J, Chlumsk√° ≈†, 2014, p. 129 The relief is now part of the permanent collection of medieval art at the National Gallery in Prague.  History of the work  The original location of the relief, which was created around 1510 and probably formed the central part of an altarpiece with side wings, is not known (possibly the castle chapel of ≈Ωebr√°k?). As recently as 1904 the relief was bought from a private owner in the village of ≈Ωebr√°k for the Prague City Museum. It was the art historian V.V. ≈†tech who, in 1913, first mentioned the sculpture in literature.V.V. ≈†tech, Oplak√°v√°n√≠ Krista, in: Umƒõleck√© poklady ƒåech I, Praha 1913, p. 8-9 It was in the collection of the National Museum until 1922, and from 1957 it has been part of the collection of the National Gallery in Prague. It was there that Ji≈ô√≠ Tes√°≈ô restored it in 1965.  Description and context  The relief was carved out of lime wood; it measures 126 x 121 x 15 cm and features traces of original polychromy. Portraying nine figures, the scene is arranged in two spatial planes. In the foreground, Mary holds the body of the dead Christ in her arms. She is accompanied on her left by St. John, who is taking the crown of thorns from Christ's head, and Mary Magdalene who brings a vessel containing balsam. In the background there probably stands one of the Jews mentioned in the Gospel of Nicodemus together with one of the Marys (Mary of Clopas?); on the right there is a weeping woman, probably Salome, with Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea who is holding the cloth for wrapping the body. The gestures of Mary, who is holding Christ's limp body in her arms, and St John, who turns away in pain, are restrained and free of pathos. The weeping woman standing on the right behind the Virgin Mary, modelled on a figure in the Descent from the Cross by Rogier van der Weyden, is executed in careful and detailed carving. The pleating of most of the figures‚Äô garments is subordinated to the overall composition and their decorative effect is suppressed. The dramatic aspect is created by the chaotic crumpling of the drapery under Christ‚Äôs body and the naturalistic depiction of his body with its wounds and sources of blood that refer to his human nature. The expressive effect is reinforced by the striking way Christ's head hangs down; John's crossed arms draw attention to his thorn crown. Christ's body is long and bony, and resembles another work by the Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation ‚Äì the Group Sculpture of the Holy Trinity at the South Bohemian Museum in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. The types of faces in both works also correspond with each other ‚Äì God the Father and Joseph of Arimathaea. The face of Mary Magdalene also matches the free-standing sculpture of the same saint at the Museum in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice.Opitz J, 1935/36, pp. 88‚Äì91 The central Piet√† is modelled on the work by a Brussels master from the circle of Rogier van der Weyden (1448).Bart Fransen, Een pi√´ta uit het atelier van Rogier van der Weyden, bestemd voor het Bendedictinessenklooster van Vorst in De oude abdij van Drongen, Leuven, 2006, pp. 471‚Äì473 The diagonal of Christ's body with its hanging arms and the head of Mary Magdalene form a triangular composition. The diagonals of the main characters (Mary Magdalene, Christ and John) with their slender limbs form an X-shape in the centre of the relief along with another triangle whose top is formed by Joseph of Arimathaea's head.Opitz J, 1935/36, p. 88 The motif of the scene is derived from paintings by the Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden (Descent from the Cross, 1435, Miraflores Altarpiece, 1445) and D√ºrer's woodcut depicting the Lamentation of Christ (1496). Earlier literature mentioned a relationship between the Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation and the Kefermarkt Altarpiece;Krop√°ƒçek J, 1960, pp. 160 -175 however more recent works have highlighted the Swabian influence (the Velhartice retable, Gregor Erhart) as well as that of Danube-region sculptures and the Viennese work of Nicolaus Gerhaert and Erasmus Grasser.Homolka J, 1969, pp. 563‚Äì564 The Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation followed on from the tradition of late 15th-century woodcarving represented by the Velhartice retable. In his work, the excited pathos and intensity of emotional experience dominates over the physical essence of the figures that are characterised by small heads and elongated bodies. The lyrical element, whose Mannerist proportional arbitrariness recalls echoes of the International Gothic style, mingles here with detailed realistic carving of the faces and the expressive modelling of drapery characteristic of the Late Gothic crumpled folds period.Kutal A, 1972, p. 193 = Other known works by Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation = * 1510 Mourning Mary of Kralovice * 1510‚Äì1520 Holy Trinity, ƒåesk√© BudƒõjovicePeter Kov√°ƒç, Die Heilige Dreifaltigkeit von ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice des Meisters der ≈Ωebr√°ker Beweinung ‚Äì Zusammenfassung * 1510‚Äì1520 Suffering of Christ, ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice * 1510‚Äì1520 Stigmatisation of St. Francis, ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice * 1510‚Äì1520 Mary Magdalene of Mal√Ω Bor * 1510‚Äì1520 Madonna of Mal≈°√≠n, National Gallery in Prague * 1510‚Äì1520 Adoration of the Magi of Vod≈àany * 1520 Crucified Christ, Dominican convent in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice  Notes  References  * Fajt Ji≈ô√≠, Chlumsk√° ≈†tƒõp√°nka, ƒåechy a st≈ôedn√≠ Evropa 1200‚Äì1550, N√°rodn√≠ galerie v Praze 2014, pp. 129‚Äì131 * Jindra P, Ottov√° M, (ed.), Obrazy kr√°sy a sp√°sy, Gotika v jihoz√°padn√≠ch ƒåech√°ch, pp. 402‚Äì405 Arbor Vitae, a Z√°padoƒçesk√° galerie v Plzni 2013, * Albert Kutal, ƒåesk√© gotick√© umƒõn√≠, Obelisk Artia, Praha 1972, p. 168, 193 * Jarom√≠r Homolka, K nƒõkter√Ωm ot√°zk√°m st≈ôedoevropsk√© plastiky 15. stolet√≠, Umƒõn√≠ XVII, 1969, pp. 539‚Äì573 * Ji≈ô√≠ Krop√°ƒçek, Uk≈ôi≈æovan√Ω z b√Ωval√©ho dominik√°nsk√©ho kl√°≈°tera v ƒåesk√Ωch Budƒõjovic√≠ch, Umƒõn√≠ VIII, 1960, pp. 160‚Äì175 * Josef Opitz, Mistr reliefu Oplak√°v√°n√≠ Krista ze ≈Ωebr√°ku, D√≠lo XVII, 935/36, pp. 88‚Äì91 On line  External links  * Encyclopaedia of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice (in Czech) Category:Bohemian Gothic sculptures Category:Collections of the National Gallery Prague Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation ","title":"Lamentation of Christ (Master of the ≈Ωebr√°k Lamentation of Christ)"},{"id":"49241951","text":"David Miklavƒçiƒç (born 29 January 1983) is a Slovenian handball player for RK Gorenje Velenje and the Slovenian national team.

It was first isolated by Dr. Edward R. Baldwin in 1905. The strain came from a 19 year old patient with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis at the Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York. It was maintained for many years by serial passage of cultures at the Trudeau Sanatorium and initially named strain H37. Over time it was found to have variable virulence in animal models based on which medium it was grown on. Strains with different virulence were then intentionally produced, with H37R being less virulent after growing in acidic media and H37S was more virulent in guinea pigs after being grown in alkaline media (with R standing for resistant to environment, and S for sensitive to environment). The more virulent strain was later renamed H37Rv, with R standing for rough morphology and v standing for virulent. The strain was used for many laboratory studies and became the standard for tuberculosis. It was later designated as the neotype for the species. Koch first discovered mycobacterium tuberculosis as the cause of tuberculosis in 1892 but the strains he studied were not preserved and it is unclear how related H37Rv may be to those strains. H37Rv has continued to be the strain of tuberculosis most used in laboratories, and was the first to have its complete genome published in 1998. It is unclear how much H37Rv may have evolved in more than 100 years under artificial conditions in laboratories from strains in the wild, but its genome is similar to a strain isolated from a 19th century grave in Yorkshire. However it does not have some characteristics, such as causing caseous necrosis in rabbits, that are seen in modern clinical isolates. Strains in different labs that derive from H37Rv have also been shown to have evolved differences over time, with one survey of 6 strains finding from 5 to 10 polymorphisms per strain. These included independent insertions and deletions of IS6110 transposable elements which would change the strain's spoligotype. The authors of the study cautioned against considering all strains labeled as H37Rv as a reference since there may be significant differences based on the laboratory in which it is maintained.
