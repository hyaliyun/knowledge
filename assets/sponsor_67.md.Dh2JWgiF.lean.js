He used the pseudonyms Undecimus (in The Reasoner) and Indicus (1865). Life The son of William Bell, he was educated in Wandsworth, London. In 1841 he went to Madras in the East India Company's service. He was a secularist and supporter of George Jacob Holyoake, who gave Bell's name in 1856 on a short list of those who had done most for the free-thought movement, and he had a share in Holyoake's \\"British Secular Institute of Secularism and Propagandism\\".The History of the Fleet Street House: a report of sixteen years, note p. 15, Cowen Tracts (1856).

In 1851 he spoke at the first Free Discussion Festival, at the City Road Hall of Science. He was also one of John Chapman's authors. Bell was strongly critical of the East India Company, and its impact on peasant proprietorship in India. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Bell lost his position in Nagpur, for complaining over the head of his immediate superior about the treatment of the Ranis of the Nagpur kingdom. In Madras in the early 1860s, he was secretary of the Madras Literary Society, and edited its Madras Journal in 1861. When Whitley Stokes moved to India, he successfully identified an anonymous translator of Omar Khayyám as Edward FitzGerald, much before this fact was generally known, and named him in the Journal. In 1864 Stokes attributed the Madras (pirate) edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam to Bell. Bell retired on half pay in 1866.2010 Sylvia Pankhurst Memorial Lecture, V.

The cellmates discover, hidden behind a loose brick of the cell-wall, an old hand-written journal which belonged to a prisoner named Danvers in the 1920s who mysteriously disappeared from his cell. The book is filled with incantations and symbols of black magic. Although sceptical, Carrere reads aloud one of the incantations and the prisoners are shocked when a bright, burning symbol briefly materialises on the floor. Carrere, and then Lassalle both study the book and they begin to have disturbing visions. Paquerette wakes up one morning to find that during the night, his fingers have vanished. The cellmates argue over what to do with the book. Paquerette grabs the book and starts to eat its pages only to be over-powered by an unseen force which twists his entire body until his spine and neck snap. The other three prisoners are blamed by the guards for Paquerette's death, condemning them to stay in prison for life. Lasselle believes that the book was defending itself. A new prisoner named Picus arrives, a friendly, eccentric man who always carries a video camera. Later, the others wake up one morning to find that Picus has disappeared, leaving his camera and the journal on the floor. They watch the last piece of footage on the camera in which Picus reads an incantation from the book whereupon a brightly lit doorway appears on the wall through which he walks. They ask the guards about Picus but the latter reply that they do not know who the cellmates are talking about, revealing that Picus was a hallucination concocted by the book, designed to reveal the book's true powers. Carrere has been abandoned by his wife and he will never see his beloved son again, the only relic of whom he possesses is an action-figure doll that belonged to his offspring. Carrere now sees the book as his only chance to escape. The three prisoners read aloud the same incantation that Picus read and the brightly illuminated door-way again appears in the cell wall, through which they walk. They find themselves in a dirty, much older prison cell and the book does not offer a means of escape. They realise that they have entered Danvers’ cell as it was in the 1920s. Carrere and Marcus become angry but Lassalle remains calm and without warning kills Marcus with a sharpened rock. Carrere is furious but Lassalle explains that he finally understands the nature of the book's powers- it was not intended to let them physically escape but to enable them all to realise their deepest desires albeit at a terrible price. A flashback sequence reveals the true fate of the cell's original inhabitant Danvers. Obsessed with youth, Danvers uttered his final spell and the book transformed him into a young man but the reverse ageing did not stop until he was reduced to an unborn infant, dissolving into nothingness. Lassalle says that Marcus' desire to become a woman was not strong enough and he could only be set free through death. Lassalle, who has always been obsessed with, and terrified of, the powers of the written word, grips the book and merges with it, its powers crushing the life out of him. Now the only survivor, Carrere states aloud his dearest wish- to see his son again- and his mouth opens in a silent scream as his eyes vanish. The final scenes occur outside the cell. Carrere's estranged wife and son arrive to collect his belongings, a prison official explaining that Carrere and his cellmates have mysteriously vanished. As they drive home, Carrere's young son plays with the action figure that his father had kept in his cell. The doll's head is seen in close-up and is revealed to have Carrere's living eyes, now able to see his son.

His father was the manager of the ironworks Association in Düsseldorf. During his high school years Bierbrauer studied piano and performed in public as a piano soloist. His piano teacher recommended the philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner to him. In 1930 Bierbrauer produced his first still life and within a year began his first figurative drawings. He created portraits of people in his neighborhood. In 1934 he traveled to the Goetheanum in Dornach (Switzerland) to study the works of Rudolf Steiner. In 1935, he began his study of medicine at the University of Marburg. He continued his study of medicine at Freiburg, Jena and at the Medical Academy in Düsseldorf. From 1940 to 1942 he served in the military service in France. In 1942 Bierbrauer was called back to Düsseldorf due to the lack of military available in Düsseldorf during World War II. He received his doctorate there in 1943 and in January 1945 he sent to the Eastern Front as a military doctor. He was captured in Wroclaw and transported to Transcaucasia (Mingitschaur) to work as a roadbuilder and concrete worker as a Russian prisoner of war. During his imprisonment, on behalf of the prisoner-of-war camp management Bierbrauer painted documentary images of the geological investigations of the terminal moraines. The prisoners also worked on archaeological excavations of medean graves. He was forbidden from painting and was ordered to create portraits of the guards. In 1949, he returned to Düsseldorf where he became a volunteer physician at the University Hospital in Hamburg. From 1951 to 1953 he worked as psychotherapist at the 2nd Medical Academy in Düsseldorf, specializing in hypnosis treatments. At this time he began the creation of his first hypnosis paintings. His public opposition against electroshock therapy and insulin shock treatments lead to his release from hospital in 1953/1954. During the summer semester, he attended a class called on monumental painting and wall painting under the direction of at the Kölner Werkschulen. He applied to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf but was rejected. In 1954 he received the circular medical certificate to establish himself as a general medical practitioner. Bierbrauer now specialized on nervous disorders and psychosomatic disorders. He focused on therapies that utilized hypnosis. After 1960, he began making somnambulistic paintings. A heart attack in 1965 forced Bierbrauer to end working as a doctor. In 1973, he declared himself to be a freelance artist and started teaching painting lessons to children at his home. These lessons later became the first Waldorf kindergarten in Düsseldorf. Bierbrauer also worked as a pianist in Waldorf schools. In 1974 he applied again to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and was accepted. He spent two years there. At the same time he attended lectures of philosophy at Heinz Rudolf at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. Starting in 1990, Bierbrauer created art which he described as Müllkunst (trash art). 1998 Bierbrauer moved to the anthroposophically oriented Heinrich-Zschokke Senior house in Düsseldorf- Gerresheim, that he also initiated. In 2000, his works were presented to the general public during the presentation of his monography at the NRW Forum for the first time. Bazon Brock and Gabriele Lohberg, Director of the Europäische Kunstakademie Trier (European Academy of Fine Arts Trier) held the introduction speeches.(1) Life in Anthroposophic Senior home became intolerable to him. Some of his art works were destroyed due to unannounced renovations at his senior home.(2) At age 91 he moved to a new senior him in the Kasierwerther Diakonie, Ratingen. In 2012 Bierbrauer was involved in the exhibition \\"The Great,\\" at the Museum Kunst Palast Düsseldorf where his hypnosis works were on display. He attended the exhibition. In the autumn of the same year Bierbrauer died of heart failure.(3)  Work  Adolf Bierbrauer,the elephantine tantrum, Bronze sculpture, 2002, Vol. 30 Bierbrauer's key works are his hypnosis pictures from the early 1950s, his somnambulistic works, and his sculptures. The focus of his work is the human being. In his early work pure representations of people, such as portraits and nudes can be found. He approached his artwork with concepts drawn from his background as a physician and psychotherapist, applying concepts of the human psyche to his work. Bierbrauer painted the hypnosis images after stories and pictures from his patients in trance. They were created after the end of World War II created until the early 1950s. Bierbrauer's art involved his work as a psychotherapist- using what he saw during hypnosis and narration from his patients, who were overcoming the personal traumas left by war. He claimed that he painted his pictures for the patients, in order to connect with them. He believed his works helped the patients while the patients' assisted his development as an artist creating works centered on the human psyche. In his understanding the artist could be a healer. With these works he had been one of the pioneers of the conceptual art movement in the 1960s in Europe. His hypnosis paintings were accompanied with Bazon Brock and a performance of Joseph Beuys washing feet. Bazon Brock wrote in his book \\"Der Barbar als Kulturheld\\" (The barbarian as a cultural hero): \\"The results of these images that emerged then, are ultimately that important because they are artistic formally on the absolute highest level of its time. There is nothing comparable in the '50s.\\"(5) For Bierbrauer, since the late 1960s somnambulistic work had many parallels to works by informal artists like Emilio Vedova and Emil Schumacher. Their techniques are comparable also to the works of the abstract expressionism by Jackson Pollock or Jean-Michel Basquiat. Bierbrauer, trained by the hypnosis of his patients, began in this period to abstract from the patient's images and now betook himself into a somnambulistic, in a daydream-like state. He made paintings based on the \\"incorporation\\" of others and the search for his own identity. Bierbrauer also produced sculptures. In his bronze figures such as the elephantine tantrum from 2001 he used an expressive free, unbound to the concrete form design, which received its informal expression which is increased by the titles- finding. They appear as trash-like sculptures, mostly composed of found material (see also Arte povera), connected with glue, metal wires and tinfoil.

She began playing wheelchair basketball for fun at the hospital in 2005. In 2009, she was selected as part of the national team. Classified as a 2.5 point player, Lindholm plays power forward. She was part of the team that won the European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, in 2011, thereby qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. As part of the team's preparation, they toured the United States and Australia. The German team went through the group stage undefeated, but started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. In the Gold Medal match in London, the team faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, which had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney just a few months before. In front of a crowd of over 12,985 at the North Greenwich Arena, they defeated the Australians 58–44 to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball since 1984. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, They were also named Team of the Year in Disability Sports for 2012, an annual award voted for by 3,000 members of the Association of German Sports Journalists. Lindholm's local team, Hamburger SV, which also included national teammates Mareike Adermann and Edina Müller (and Australia's Bridie Kean) won the women's national championship for the eighth time in 2013. Lindholm was also part of the Hamburger SV team that had previously won it in 2010. The German national team was not so fortunate, losing the final of the European Championship to the Netherlands before a home town crowd in Frankfurt. It claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States.

Britain contributed to the Manhattan Project by helping initiate the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project. In August 1943, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which provided for cooperation between the two countries. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate the efforts of the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period. A British Mission led by Wallace Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology in New York. Britain also produced the powdered nickel required by the gaseous diffusion process. Another mission, led by Oliphant who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process. As head of the British Mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory, James Chadwick led a multinational team of distinguished scientists that included Sir Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, Peierls, Frisch, and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet atomic spy. Four members of the British Mission became group leaders at Los Alamos. William Penney observed the bombing of Nagasaki and participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946. Cooperation ended with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, and Ernest Titterton, the last British government employee, left Los Alamos on 12 April 1947. Britain then proceeded with High Explosive Research, its own nuclear weapons programme, and became the third country to test an independently developed nuclear weapon in October 1952.  Origins  Australian physicist Mark Oliphant was a key figure in the launching of both the British and United States nuclear weapons programmes The 1938 discovery of nuclear fission in uranium by Otto Robert Frisch, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. Refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries were particularly alarmed by the notion of a German nuclear weapon project. In the United States, three of them, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Albert Einstein, were moved to write the Einstein–Szilárd letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the danger. This led to the President creating the Advisory Committee on Uranium. In Britain, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg were sufficiently concerned to take up the matter. Their concerns reached the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay, who consulted with Sir Henry Tizard. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds against success at 100,000 to 1. Even at such long odds, the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing. But at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on the University's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, the only fissile isotope found in significant quantity in nature, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite. Oliphant took the Frisch–Peierls memorandum to Tizard, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known as Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.  Early Anglo- American cooperation  In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. As part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. Oliphant, one of the Maud Committee's members, flew to the United States in late August 1941, and discovered that vital information had not reached key American physicists. He met the Uranium Committee, and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence, who was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Lawrence in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was a success; key American physicists became aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb. Armed with British data, Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), briefed Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace in a meeting at the White House on 9 October 1941. Sir John Anderson, minister responsible for Tube Alloys The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union. Yet the United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. Britain was spending around £430,000 per year on research and development, and Metropolitan-Vickers was building gaseous diffusion units for uranium enrichment worth £150,000; but the Manhattan Project was spending £8,750,000 on research and development, and had let construction contracts worth £100,000,000 at the fixed wartime rate of four dollars to the pound. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, that: \\"We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\\" By then, the positions of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941. The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942, wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar. American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing \\"ninety percent of the work\\" on the bomb, it would be \\"better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help\\". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so slowed down the American project. In retaliation, the British stopped sending information and scientists to America, and the Americans then stopped all information sharing. The British considered how they would produce a bomb without American help. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce of weapons-grade uranium per day was estimated to cost up to £3,000,000 in research and development, and anything up to £50,000,000 to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce of plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost £5,000,000. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water for the reactor costing between £5,000,000 and £10,000,000, and for producing uranium metal £1,500,000. The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require 20,000 workers, many of them highly skilled, 500,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 kW of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to obtain American cooperation.  Cooperation resumes  Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, a British representative on the Combined Policy Committee By March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from assistance from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and several other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant. Churchill took up the matter with Roosevelt at the Washington Conference on 25 May 1943, and Churchill thought that Roosevelt gave the reassurances he sought; but there was no follow-up. Bush, Stimson and William Bundy met Churchill, Cherwell and Anderson at 10 Downing Street in London. None of them was aware that Roosevelt had already made his decision, writing to Bush on 20 July 1943 with instructions to \\"renew, in an inclusive manner, the full exchange with the British Government regarding Tube Alloys.\\" Stimson, who had just finished a series of arguments with the British about the need for an invasion of France, was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war cooperation, Cherwell explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded \\"in more majestic language\\". News arrived in London of Roosevelt's decision on 27 July, and Anderson was dispatched to Washington with the draft agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt signed what became known as the Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Even before the Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with instructions that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, the day it was signed, expecting to be able to talk to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times. The first occasion was on 8 September 1943, on the afternoon after Stimson discovered that he was the chairman. The first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by Major General Wilhelm D. Styer. Because the Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members were Richard C. Tolman, who was Groves's scientific adviser, and C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the Canadian National Research Council. It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. The Technical Subcommittee held its first meeting on 10 September, but negotiations dragged on. The Combined Policy Committee ratified the proposals in December 1943, by which time several British scientists had already commenced working on the Manhattan Project in the United States. There remained the issue of cooperation between the Manhattan's Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources to build a nuclear reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. At that time, the United States controlled, by a supply contract, the only major production site on the continent, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia. Given that it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any information about plutonium. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The Canadian ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor went critical on 5 September 1945. Chadwick supported British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise them away from the wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged. The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.  Gaseous diffusion project  Tube Alloys made its greatest advances in gaseous diffusion technology, and Chadwick had originally hoped that the pilot plant at least would be built in Britain. Gaseous diffusion technology was devised by Simon and three expatriates, Nicholas Kurti from Hungary, Heinrich Kuhn from Germany, and Henry Arms from the United States, at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment, two two-stage models and two ten-stage models, was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers at a cost of £150,000 for the four units. Two single-stage machines were later added. Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single-stage machine did not commence until June 1943, and with the two-stage machine until August 1943. The two ten-stage machines were delivered in August and November 1943, but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events. Clydach Refinery in Wales, seen in 2006, supplied the Manhattan Project with nickel powder under Reverse Lend-Lease The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to meet with representatives of Kellex, who were designing and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with research and development of the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor would it be possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex. The British mission consisting of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This was a critical time. Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision had to be made whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing that his company could get it ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944. The United States Army assumed responsibility for procuring sufficient quantities of the right type of powdered nickel. In this, the British were able to help. The only company that manufactured it was the Mond Nickel Company at Clydach in Wales. By the end of June 1945, it had supplied the Manhattan Project with of nickel powder, paid for by the British government and supplied to the United States under Reverse Lend-Lease. The Americans planned to have the K-25 plant in full production by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it would be unlikely to reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945. After the rest of the mission departed, Peierls, Kurti and Fuchs remained in New York, where they worked with Kellex. They were joined there by Tony Skyrme and Frank Kearton, who arrived in March 1944. Kurti returned to England in April 1944 and Kearton in September. Peierls moved on to the Los Alamos Laboratory in February 1944; Skyrme followed in July, and Fuchs in August.  Electromagnetic project  On 26 May 1943, Oliphant wrote to Appleton to say that he had been considering the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more practical to use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method, there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process, taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham. Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, and they attempted to persuade him to join the Los Alamos Laboratory, but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project. Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His requests for personnel were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35,The members of the mission were M. L. Oliphant, H. S. W. Massey, T. E. Allibone, J. Sayers, S. M. Duke, E. H. S. Burhop, O. Bunemann, H. J. Emeleus, R. H. Dawton, D. F. Stanley, K. J. R. Wilkinson. M. E. Haine, J. P. Keene, M. J. Moore, S. Rowlands, C. S. Watt, R. M. Williams, H. S. Tomlinson, R. R. Nimmo, P.P. Starling, H. Skinner, M. H. F. Wilkins, S. C. Curran, Joan Curran, W. D. Allen, F. Smith, G. Page, H. J. Morris, M. P. Edwards, J. P. Baxter, C. J. Milner, J. D. Craggs, A. G. Jones, H. E. Evans, A. A. Smales. . two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders. Members of the British mission occupied several key positions in the electromagnetic project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and was in charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions such as whether to expand the electromagnetic plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.  Los Alamos Laboratory  William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockroft wearing the Medals of Freedom awarded for their services to the Manhattan Project When cooperation resumed in September 1943, Groves and Oppenheimer revealed the existence of the Los Alamos Laboratory to Chadwick, Peierls and Oliphant. Oppenheimer wanted all three to proceed to Los Alamos as soon as possible, but it was decided that Oliphant would go to Berkeley to work on the electromagnetic process and Peierls would go to New York to work on the gaseous diffusion process. The task then fell to Chadwick. The original idea, favoured by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favour of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. First to arrive was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton and his wife Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch continued his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, was one of the few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C. When Oppenheimer appointed Hans Bethe as the head of the laboratory's prestigious Theoretical (T) Division, he offended Edward Teller, who was given his own group, tasked with investigating Teller's \\"Super\\" bomb, and eventually assigned to Enrico Fermi's F Division. Oppenheimer then wrote to Groves requesting that Peierls be sent to take Teller's place in T Division. Peierls arrived from New York on 8 February 1944, and subsequently succeeded Chadwick as head of the British Mission at Los Alamos. Egon Bretscher worked in Teller's Super group, as did Anthony French, who later recalled that \\"never at any time did I have anything to do with the fission bomb once I went to Los Alamos.\\" Four members of the British Mission became group leaders: Bretscher (Super Experimentation), Frisch (Critical Assemblies and Nuclear Specifications), Peierls (Implosion Hydrodynamics) and George Placzek (Composite Weapon).Members of the British mission to Los Alamos were: Aage Bohr (Denmark), Niels Bohr (Denmark), Egon Bretscher, James Chadwick, Lord Cherwell, Boris Davidson. Anthony French, Otto Frisch, Klaus Fuchs, James Hughes, Derrick Littler, Carson Mark (Canada), William Marley, Donald Marshall, G. A. McMillan, Philip Moon, Mrs Philip Moon, Mark Oliphant (Australia), Rudolf Peierls, Lord Portal, William Penney, George Placzek, Michael Poole, Joseph Rotblat (Poland), Herold Sheard, Tony Skyrme, Geoffrey Taylor, Ernest Titterton, Mrs Ernest Titterton, James L. Tuck and W. L. Webster. and . Niels Bohr and his son Aage, a physicist who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December on the first of several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He played an important role in the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army. Nuclear physicists knew about fission, but not the hydrodynamics of conventional explosions. As a result, there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions in this area of physics. First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing. In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying to wrestle with the idea of the implosion issue. Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place. Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer. This work was crucial to the success of the plutonium atomic bomb: Italian-American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945. The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue. Taylor's presence was desired so much at Los Alamos, Chadwick informed London, \\"that anything short of kidnapping would be justified\\". He was sent, and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The acute need for scientists with an understanding of explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty, and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory. Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses. Bethe considered Fuchs \\"one of the most valuable men in my division\\" and \\"one of the best theoretical physicists we had.\\" James Tuck's ID badge photo from Los Alamos William Penney worked on means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion, and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan. He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent by Wilson as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big Stink. He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs. Bethe declared that: From December 1945 on, members of the British Mission began returning home. Peierls left in January 1946. At the request of Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as laboratory director, Fuchs remained until 15 June 1946. Eight British scientists, three from Los Alamos and five from the United Kingdom, participated in Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. Titterton was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed. Carson Mark remained, as he was a Canadian government employee. He remained at Los Alamos, becoming head of its Theoretical Division in 1947, a position he held until he retired in 1973. He became a United States citizen in the 1950s.  Feed materials  Uranium ore from the Shinkolobwe Mine in the Congo The Combined Development Trust was proposed by the Combined Policy Committee on 17 February 1944. The declaration of trust was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 13 June 1944. The trustees were approved at the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The United States trustees were Groves, who was elected chairman, geologist Charles K. Leith, and George L. Harrison. The British trustees were Sir Charles Hambro, the head of the British Raw Materials Mission in Washington, D.C., and Frank Lee from HM Treasury. Canada was represented by George C. Bateman, a deputy minister and member of the Canadian Combined Resources Board. Each of the three governments had its own raw materials resources staff, and the Combined Development Trust was a means of coordinating their efforts. The role of the Combined Development Trust was to purchase or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding was to come from the United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account in the office of the United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust. Payments were then made from this account. Britain took the lead in negotiations to reopen the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, the world's richest source of uranium ore, which had been flooded and closed, as 30 percent of the stock in Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the company that owned the mine, was controlled by British interests. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador John Winant hammered out a deal in May 1944 with Edgar Sengier, the director of Union Minière, and the Belgian government for the mine to be reopened and of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound. The Combined Development Trust also negotiated deals with Swedish companies to acquire ore from there. Oliphant approached the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir Stanley Bruce, in August 1943 about uranium supplies from Australia, and Anderson made a direct request to the prime minister of Australia, John Curtin, during the latter's visit to Britain in May 1944 to initiate mineral exploration in Australia in places where uranium deposits were believed to exist. As well as uranium, the Combined Development Trust secured supplies of thorium from Brazil, Netherlands East Indies, Sweden and Portugal. At the time uranium was believed to be a rare mineral, and the more abundant thorium was seen as a possible alternative, as it could be irradiated to produce uranium-233, another isotope of uranium suitable for making atomic bombs.  Intelligence  In December 1943, Groves sent Robert R. Furman to Britain to establish a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project to coordinate scientific intelligence with the British government. Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District's security activities, Captain Horace K. Calvert, to head the London Liaison Office with the title of Assistant Military Attaché. He worked in cooperation with Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh, the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6, and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys. An Anglo-American intelligence committee was formed by Groves and Anderson in November 1944, consisting of Perrin, Welsh, Calvert, Furman and R. V. Jones. At the urging of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct intelligence in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end agreed to participate in the Alsos Mission as a junior partner.British members of the Alsos Mission were: H. W. B. Adams, J. B. Barnes, Wing Commander R. G. Cecil, Major D. C. Gattiker, Colonel C. J. Hambro, Flight Lieutenant B. Higman, Major J. Iball, Lieutenant C. P. Lea, Lieutenant Colonel M. W. Perrin, Lieutenant Colonel P. Rothwell, Major H. C. Wallwork, Lieutenant Commander E. Welsh, Lieutenant C. Wilson. In June 1945, Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans, and Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The house was bugged, and the conversations of the scientists were recorded.  Results  The prime minister, Clement Attlee, shakes hands with the United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes on 10 November 1945 Groves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them. He considered British assistance \\"helpful but not vital\\", but acknowledged that \\"without active and continuing British interest, there probably would have been no atomic bomb to drop on Hiroshima.\\" He considered Britain's key contributions to have been encouragement and support at the intergovernmental level, scientific aid, the production of powdered nickel in Wales, and preliminary studies and laboratory work. Cooperation did not long survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought it had something to do with naval guns. Harry S. Truman, who had succeeded Roosevelt on the latter's death, Clement Attlee, who had replaced Churchill as prime minister in July 1945, Anderson and United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes conferred while on a boat cruise on the Potomac River, and agreed to revise the Quebec Agreement. On 15 November 1945, Groves, Robert P. Patterson and George L. Harrison met a British delegation consisting of Anderson, Wilson, Malcolm MacDonald, Roger Makins and Denis Rickett to draw up a communiqué. They agreed to retain the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust. The Quebec Agreement's requirement for \\"mutual consent\\" before using nuclear weapons was replaced with one for \\"prior consultation\\", and there was to be \\"full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy\\", but in the longer Memorandum of Intention, signed by Groves and Anderson, this was only \\"in the field of basic scientific research\\". Patterson took the communiqué to the White House, where Truman and Attlee signed it on 16 November 1945. President Harry Truman and prime ministers Clement Attlee and Mackenzie King board the for discussions about nuclear weapons, November 1945 The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. Attlee's response on 6 June 1946 \\"did not mince words nor conceal his displeasure behind the nuances of diplomatic language.\\" At issue was not just technical cooperation, which was fast disappearing, but the allocation of uranium ore. During the war this was of little concern, as Britain had not needed any ore, so all the production of the Congo mines and all the ore seized by the Alsos Mission had gone to the United States, but now it was also required by the British atomic project. Chadwick and Groves reached an agreement by which ore would be shared equally. The McMahon Act, which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended technical cooperation. Its control of \\"restricted data\\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. The remaining scientists were denied access to papers that they had written just days before. The terms of the Quebec Agreement remained secret, but senior members of Congress were horrified when they discovered that it gave the British a veto over the use of nuclear weapons. The McMahon Act fuelled resentment from British scientists and officials alike, and led directly to the British decision in January 1947 to develop its own nuclear weapons. In January 1948, Bush, James Fisk, Cockcroft and Mackenzie concluded an agreement known as the modus vivendi, that allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada. As the Cold War set in, enthusiasm in the United States for an alliance with Britain cooled as well. A September 1949 poll found that 72 per cent of Americans agreed that the United States should not \\"share our atomic energy secrets with England\\". The reputation of the British Mission to Los Alamos was tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy. It damaged the relationship between the United States and Britain, and provided ammunition for Congressional opponents of cooperation like Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper. British wartime participation in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial to the success of High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

During Later Tang  Despite the high position Han Zhaoyin eventually achieved, virtually nothing is known about his personal background, as there was no biography of his in either the Old History of the Five Dynasties or the New History of the Five Dynasties. The first historical reference to him was in 934, as of which time he was serving as Li Congke's secretary in Li Congke's role as military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). In spring of that year, Li Congke overthrew his adoptive brother Li Conghou, who was then emperor, and took the throne as emperor. After doing so, he commissioned Han as an imperial scholar at Duanming Hall (端明殿), and also gave him the title of Zuo Jianyi Daifu (左諫議大夫, a high-level consultant at the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng)).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In summer of that year, Li Congke made Han his chief of staff (Shumishi). At that time, an important decision for Li Congke to make was what to do with his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang (the husband of his adoptive sister the Princess of Wei), who was then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) but who at that time was at the capital Luoyang. (Li Congke and Shi had long not liked each other even when they both served as officers under Li Congke's adoptive father Li Siyuan, and Shi had initially postured supporting Li Conghou in the civil war between Li Congke and Li Conghou, before submitting to Li Congke and being forced to go to Luoyang to confirm that submission.) Most of Li Congke's followers from Fengxiang advocated detaining Shi at Luoyang and not return him to Hedong. However, Li Siyuan's wife Empress Dowager Cao and the Princess of Wei were both begging on Shi's behalf. Han and another advisor, Li Zhuanmei (李專美), believed that detaining Shi would cause apprehension for another brother-in- law of Li Congke's, Zhao Yanshou the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and Zhao's adoptive father Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing). Li Congke ultimately decided to allow Shi to return to Hedong. Shortly after, Li Congke considered executing the officer Chu Kuangzuo (楚匡祚), who had, under Li Conghou's orders, executed Li Congke's son Li Chongji (李重吉) during the civil war. Han pointed out that Chu was merely following orders and that executing him would alienate others who had followed Li Conghou's orders. Li Congke agreed, and only exiled Chu. At that time, the chancellor Liu Xu, who was in charge of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies), was conducting a major audit of the three agencies' accounts. He discovered that much of the purported treasury reserves were in fact uncollectible debts that the administrators kept on the books to use as excuses to harshly collect from the people. Liu reported this to Li Congke and advocated a two-pronged approach — that the government make all efforts to collect the collectible debts but forgive the uncollectible ones. Han agreed with Liu and advocated adoption of Liu's proposal. Li Congke issued an edict forgiving much of the debts that were accumulated from before Li Siyuan's Changxing era (930-933). This drew praise from the people but resentment from the administrators at the three agencies. In summer 935, Han, who was then also carrying the title of minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) in addition to chief of staff, was given the title of Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng)), and given the chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). Around the new year 936, Han was sent out of Luoyang to serve as the military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title.  During Later Jin  In 936, Shi Jingtang, with support from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, rebelled against Li Congke and declared his own state of Later Jin. After the Later Tang forces he sent against Shi were defeated by the Khitan/Later Jin forces, Li Congke committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang and allowing Later Jin to take over its territory. In an edict that Shi issued after entering Luoyang that declared a general pardon, he, excepting them from the general pardon, ordered the deaths of Li Congke's close associates Zhang Yanlang, Liu Yanhao, and Liu Yanlang (劉延朗). He singled out several officials whom he stated as not complicit with Li Congke (his justification for rebelling against Li Congke was that Li Congke, as an adoptive son, was an usurper of the Later Tang throne) — Ma Yinsun, Fang Gao, Li Zhuanmei, and Han Zhaoyin — such that they were removed from their posts but spared their lives.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 939, Shi, apparently viewed his punishment of Ma, Fang, Han, and Li Zhuanmei to be too harsh (as he pitied them for being in poverty), commissioned them various offices — in Han's case, minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu) — but then immediately ordered them into retirement (i.e., to allow them to draw pensions without allowing them to return to the government).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. That was the last historical reference to Han, and it is not known when he died.

Microdisplays President John C.C. Fan describes the company's growth strategy as being based on expanding the range of applications for microdisplays. Kopin has attempted to combat the trend of digital cameras being released without viewfinders through the development of tiny electronic displays, aimed at inclusion in higher-end cameras rather than budget models. Kopin's first CyberDisplay product debuted in 1999 in a JVC digital camera; it featured a 320x240 pixel display with a diagonal measurement. In 2007, the Olympus Corporation chose a Kopin CyberDisplay with QVGA-level resolution for inclusion as a viewfinder in its SP-550 UZ model. In 2012, the company's newest CyberDisplay model had a diagonal measurement of with VGA-level resolution of 640x480 pixels. Outside of the consumer market, Kopin's microdisplays have also been used in electronics devices aimed at the military and law enforcement officers. In 2008, the United States Army awarded Kopin with the first phase of a $4.2 million program aimed at producing microdisplays more quickly and improving their performance, with the aim of incorporating them in night vision devices. In 2009, Kopin introduced its Golden-i headset computer, aimed at firefighters and security professionals. NBC reporter Monica J. Vila named the 2013 version of the Golden-i it as one of her favorite devices introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, even though it was not aimed at the consumer market. Later that year there was speculation that Kopin might enter into a deal with Microsoft or Apple to provide components for any optical head-mounted display product those companies might manufacture to compete with Google Glass, after Google chose Kopin's competitor Himax to supply components for Google Glass; however, analyst Karl Guttag stated to Seeking Alpha that he saw this as unlikely. Other products Kopin also manufactures heterojunction bipolar transistors. Among its customers for this product line is Woburn, Massachusetts-based Skyworks Solutions. Acquisitions In January 2011, Kopin acquired British optoelectronics company Forth Dimension Displays (FDD) for £7 million in cash. Kopin's president John Fan indicated in media comments that Kopin was especially interested in FDD's ultra-high resolution reflective microdisplays and time domain imaging technology.  Controversy In July 1999, Neil Bush, (son to President George H.W. Bush and brother to President George W. Bush) made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of Kopin Corp. where he had been employed as a consultant. The company announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, \\"any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information.\\"Pete Yost (Associated Press) \\"Neil Bush made 1-day stock profit of $171,370,\\" Houston Chronicle, 31 December 2003, accessed 21 November 2010. When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 February 2014. François went to work in Rome where he became rather successful. Abroad Jerôme travelled to join his older brother in Rome in 1621. During Anthony van Dyck’s period of residence in Rome, the brothers became friends with him and van Dyck painted their portraits. Jerôme worked with his brother on the baldacchino for Saint Peter's in Rome as is testified by a payment in his own name for that work received in 1627. There is no documentation on Jérôme's movements between 1627 and 1641.Denis Coekelberghs, 'A propos de Jérôme Du Quesnoy le jeune', in: La Tribune de l'Art, 1 September 2006 The assumption has been that the brothers had a falling out and split ways after which Jerôme went to work primarily in Spain, where he received court commissions, and Portugal. None of his works from that period have been traced. An alternative view of the lack of details on Jérôme's whereabouts and residence in Spain between 1627 and 1641 holds that Jérôme had in fact not left Rome for a long period of time but had been working inside the workshop of his brother in Rome assisting him with his various commissions. The trip to Spain would therefore have only been rather brief and occurred probably in the year 1640. When in 1641 Jérôme is documented as working in the workshop of the Flemish goldsmith Andreas Ghysels in Florence, he may have been doing so in the execution of designs of his brother. After a stay of nine months in Florence, Duquesnoy returned to Rome. When François left on a trip to France at the invitation of the French king to become the director of a yet to be established department of painting and sculpture called ‘Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture’, Jerôme accompanied him. During the trip François died on 12 July 1643 in Livorno of an illness from which he had already been suffering before he set out.Geert Debeuckelaere, ‘\\"For the reason that thou, Hieronymus Duquesnoy...\\", Allegations that Jerôme had murdered his brother out of jealousy have been refuted. Return to Flanders Tomb monument of Bishop Antonius Triest Instead of returning to Rome, Jerôme travelled on to his hometown Brussels where he soon received many commissions. He claimed the chests with art designs and models that had belonged to his brother and that had been sent on to Brussels. In 1644 he completed a sculpture of Saint Thomas destined for the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula in Brussels and paid for by the Council of Brabant. He also became an assistant of the court architect and painter Jacob Franquart. In 1646 he drew the design for the Our Blessed Lady chapel in the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula and directed its construction. 260pxModel for a Maria Statue Duquesnoy completed an additional three sculptures of apostles for the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula in 1646. He also made the images of the apostles Philip and Matthew for the Chapel Church in Brussels. When Jacob Franquart died in 1651, Duquesnoy succeeded to his position at the Brussels court as \\"architecte, statuaire et sculpteur de la Cour\\" (Court architect, statue maker and sculptor). In that capacity Duquesnoy completed several portraits of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, then governor of the Spanish Netherlands (now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). He received the commission for the tomb monument of Bishop Antonius Triest to be placed in the choir of the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent. He also received a commission from the family Thurn und Taxis for a marble statue of Saint Ursula to be placed in the Saint Ursula Chapel in the Sablon Church in Brussels. In 1654 Duquesnoy was living in Ghent to complete the tomb monument of Antonius Triest. He was arrested for sexually abusing two boys of respectively 8 and 11 years old and tried for sodomy. Appeals by his friends to the court in Brussels to transfer jurisdiction over the case from the local court in Ghent to the Royal Magistrate in Brussels were unsuccessful. He was sentenced to strangulation at the stake, followed by burning at the Koornmarkt, a public square in Ghent. The sentence was carried out on 28 September 1654. The tomb of Triest was left to be completed by others. Work Tomb monument of Bishop Triest (detail) Jerôme is generally regarded as a skilled sculptor, but a less original or innovative artist than his brother François. His artistic talent has been questioned based on assumptions surrounding the use for his own work of designs made by his brother, and in particular the designs for the bust (now in the Louvre Museum in Paris) and the tomb of Bishop Triest. Already in 1642 Bishop Antonius Triest had approached François Duquesnoy in relation to this bust and monument and had sent along a painting of himself to be used as the basis for the bust. François had declined the commission because of his upcoming move to France but is still said to have made a few terracotta models for putti for the monument. There is no documentation whether or how much work François had done on the design and execution of the bust before he died in 1643. It is therefore difficult to determine how much (if any) of it is of his hand. The work was probably completed in 1643 or 1644 and is signed by Jerôme. The very high quality of the execution of the portrait has led to speculation that his brother had a major (or even sole) role in its design and even execution.Philippe Malgouyres: Le buste d'Antoine Triest (1576–1657), évêque de Gand, par les frères Duquesnoy, entre au Louvre, in: La Revue du Louvre et des musées de France, 2000, n° 4,p.15-17 It is likely that the design of the tomb monument itself, which was made almost a decade later, was by Jerôme's own hand. The monument is placed in an architectural frame of black and white marble and depicts Mary and Christ looking down on the effigy of the Bishop reclining on a sarcophagus. The portrait of the Bishop in the monument is particularly fine although some have compared it unfavourably with the earlier bust of the Bishop. He worked in the baroque style with classicistic tendencies pioneered by his brother. One of his most successful works is the marble statue of a kneeling Saint Ursula placed in the Saint Ursula Chapel in the Sablon Church in Brussels. His style can be clearly seen in the marble depicting the Rape of Ganymede (Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History)A.

He also has been writing and performing comedic raps as ZDoggMD, an internet celebrity known for his music videos, parodies, and comedy sketches about medical issues, as well as systemic issues with healthcare. Damania was a practicing hospitalist (physician specializing in acutely ill patients admitted to the hospital) at Stanford University School of Medicine for 10 years. He was then the founder of Turntable Health, a direct primary care clinic in Downtown Las Vegas that was funded by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh. Early life and education Damania was born in New Jersey, and grew up in Clovis, California, to which his family moved when he was eight years old, with his parents, both Parsi doctors (his father was a private practice primary care doctor, his mother a psychiatrist) who had immigrated from Pune, India, in 1970, and two younger siblings.\\"Q&A; with Zubin Damania, aka ZDoggMD\\"\\"Mixing Health Care And Hip-Hop, This Doctor With Valley Roots Wants To Change Medicine\\" He quipped: \\"I am the oldest of three children in the family, but sometimes my parents consider me the only child because the other two are not doctors.\\" He has polydactyly on his feet. He attended Clovis West High School, graduating in 1991.\\"Get set for tacos, a parody music fundraiser and your new country favorites,\\" The Fresno Bee. He then went on to receive an undergraduate degree at University of California, Berkeley, where he minored in music and majored in molecular biology and cell biology. While there he completed a research thesis in a genetics lab on integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion pathways in the Drosophila melanogaster model with James Fristrom. Damania attended medical school at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF), and graduated in 1999. His time in school was marked by a series of pursuits that combined comedy and medicine: he streamed medical comedy routines for a startup called Medschool.com, and performed medical based standup routines for drug companies, hospitals, and other medical organizations. He also gave the commencement speech at UCSF at his graduation, which has had tens of thousands of views on YouTube, and made NPR's list of top commencement speeches of all time. Career He completed his internal medicine residency at Stanford University School of Medicine, from 1999 to 2002. Damania then stayed on at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation for ten years as a hospitalist from 2003 to 2012, spending 70% of his time at Stanford University Hospital (where he was an Adjunct Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine) and 30% of his time at Washington Hospital in Fremont, California, and receiving the Russell Lee Award for Clinical Teaching. He simultaneously maintained a side hobby performing stand-up comedy for medical audiences worldwide. Disheartened by the traditional fee-for-service model on which the American medical system is based, Damania became increasingly frustrated with his work. With the encouragement of Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos.com, Damania began writing, performing, and filming musical parodies about the frustrations of work as a doctor, posting them on YouTube to immediate success. He developed a persona called ZDoggMD, fashioned as a gangsta rapper who was upset about popular misconceptions of healthcare in the US. Damania gave a presentation called \\"Are Zombie Doctors Taking Over America?\\" at TEDMED 2013. In it he outlines the lingering problems of the US healthcare system, and how he has re- conceived it at Turntable Health into a patient-centered organization dedicated to preventative care. His speech was called one of the best of the conference. US News and World Report called his critique of American healthcare \\"scalpel-sharp\\" and \\"at once discomfiting and comic\\". Since beginning work on the clinic, Damania has been named one of the \\"top 14 people to watch in 2014\\" by Las Vegas Weekly, and has been profiled in The Atlantic Monthly, Xconomy, Wired, Venture Beat, Gizmodo, MSNBC, and USA Today. Turntable Health was also named \\"by far the most exciting healthcare startup\\" and \\"revolutionary\\" by The Next Web. ZDoggMD ZDoggMD is an alias of Damania since 2011, and under the name he makes music videos, health-care theme parodies, and comedy sketches about contemporary medical issues and working in the medical field. When his first music video (Immunize, based on Billionaire by Travie McCoy and Bruno Mars) was viewed 200,000 times, it got Damania death threats from anti-vaccination activists, who also mounted an unsuccessful campaign to get him fired. Damania spent time reading anti- vaccination groups online and the few medical experts who were attempting to push against the tide of disinformation, such as David Gorski. He decided he could present information in a unique style, with emotion and energy. In 2020, he has produced hundreds of videos, for a total YouTube viewership exceeding 60 million, in addition to Facebook and Instagram. He still gets death threats.  Current endeavors  ZdoggMD has been featured or interviewed in several medical-based, and other well-known publications, including The Atlantic Monthly, TechCrunch, Radio Rounds, The Guardian, Mental floss, ReachMD, ScienceBlogs, ACP Hospitalist, and Today's Hospitalist, among others. His website won the 2010 Best New Medical Weblog at the 2010 Medical Weblog Awards sponsored by Epocrates and Lenovo. His videos feature a rotating cast of several characters, also practicing doctors, including, most often, Dr. Harry, a pediatrician, and Doc Quixote, Dr. Diego, and others. He often collaborates musically with Southern California DJ and producer samix, who produced the album Midriff Music by Josh Martinez which won the category \\"Best Rap Recording\\" award at the 2005 Western Canadian Music Awards. He is also currently collaborating with Devin Moore, a composer, bassist in the band “Rabbit!,” and member of Downtown Project's music development team in Las Vegas. ZdoggMD's work has been called \\"entertainment that might save your life\\", he has been labeled \\"the jolliest doctor on the West Coast\\", and \\"a genuine doctor who uses YouTube as a creativity outlet to teach people about things like safe sex, delivering bad news, stayin' healthy on vacation, and hemorrhoids.\\" His videos cover topics such as ulcers, testicular exams, Caribbean medical schools, stool transplants, overworked doctors, the role of hospitalists in medicine versus other specialists, vaccine controversies, healthcare in the US, CPR, television doctors, and being on call during the holidays. Turntable Health In 2012 Tony Hsieh invited Damania to visit Las Vegas, where Hsieh was in the process of investing $350 million of his own money in a project he hoped would revitalize Downtown Las Vegas (The Downtown Project). He convinced Damania to quit his job as Physician at Stanford, and move his family to Nevada. Hsieh tasked Damania with \\"fixing Healthcare in Vegas\\". Once in Las Vegas, Damania continued to produce videos, both as ZDoggMD and himself, while working on opening Turntable Health. While conceiving of the idea for Turntable Health, Damania met Rushika Fernandopulle, co-founder and CEO of a Boston-based startup called Iora Health, who had become known for his vision of rebuilding healthcare by removing fee-for-service episodic payments from primary care, focusing on prevention, and using a membership model. The two forged a partnership. Turntable Health, a direct primary care clinic in Downtown Las Vegas, was the result of their collaboration. It was based on a patient-focused, preventative model that subscribers could either pay a monthly fee for, or have as part of their coverage in some cases. The clinic opened in December 2013, and was an integral part of Hsieh's Downtown Project of revitalizing Las Vegas and re- visualizing urban spaces. Turntable Health shut down as of January 31, 2017. UNLV School of Medicine He has been a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNLV School of Medicine since February 2017. Personal life Damania is married to Jennifer Lin, a radiologist.

It is loosely based on the novel with the same name by Michal Viewegh. Luca, an Italian musician who lives in Prague as a music teacher at an elementary school, is in the grip of uncontrollable jealousy for his girlfriend Klara, an art history student about to graduate. Suspicious of the ambiguous relationship that the girl has with Pavel, her tutor at the university, Luca assigns a detective, Denis, to control her. After the first stalking, carried out with the help of sophisticated technologies, the detective decides to hide some evidence that he considers unimportant, almost as if he wants to protect his client from tormenting himself by unnecessary and unfounded suspicions. Thus begins a refined game of the parts between the two men that will lead them to contaminate each other: the one will transfer into the other elements and feelings that he did not know before. Denis, who lives an extremely open relationship with his wife Ruth and is in love with Nina, his assistant in the agency, loses serenity and professional \\"detachment\\". While Luca, engulfed by his passion for Klara, becomes patient and calculating, prompting the detective to follow Klara one last time on a study trip to Venice where Pavel is also present.

The Holy See confirmed the Office in 1615.  Structure  The essential structure of the Little Office of the Immaculate Conception mirrors that of the Divine Office, that is, the office is composed of Matins, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline, with the exception of Lauds and the addition of a special concluding prayer. Unlike the Divine Office, however, the Little Office does not include any psalms.  Endorsement  The Little Office currently has prescribed to it a partial indulgence by the Apostolic Penitentiary, as per section 3 of grant number 22 of the fourth edition of the Holy See's Enchiridion Indulgentiarum:  Translations  A Polish translation of the Little Office was printed in the year 1616. Neither the author nor the translator of the Polish text of the Office are known, though the excellent Polish translation made the Office accessible to Poles and ensured its popularity. It is presumed that the translation was done by a Jesuit priest in Kraków or perhaps the first translator of the Bible into Polish, Jakub Wujek. A Latin text, approved by the Holy See, was released from the press of the Apostolic Camera in 1838.  References  Bibliography  S.

Large repatriations of prisoners, particularly of soldiers of Flemish origin, to occupied Belgium occurred in 1940 and 1941. Nevertheless, as many as 70,000 remained prisoners remained in captivity until 1945, and around 1,800 died in German camps during the course of the war. Background Belgian involvement in World War II began when German forces invaded Belgium, which had been following a policy of neutrality, on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, Belgium surrendered on 28 May and was placed under German occupation. During the fighting, between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population at the time) had served in the military. King Leopold III, who had commanded the army in 1940, also surrendered to the Germans on 28 May along and remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. The Belgian government fled first to Bordeaux in France, and then to London in the United Kingdom where it formed an official government in exile in October 1940. In Belgium, an occupation administration, the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France, was established in Brussels to run the territory under Wehrmacht jurisdiction. Belgian prisoners of war Virtually all the soldiers of the Belgian army who were not killed in action were captured at some point during the fighting in May 1940, but most of these prisoners were either released unofficially at the end of hostilities or escaped from poorly-guarded compounds in Belgium and went home. Escaped prisoners who returned home were rarely arrested by the Germans, and there was no systematic attempt to recapture former Belgian soldiers who had left German captivity in 1940. Modern-day view of a barracks at Stalag X-B at Sandbostel, where 1,700 Belgians were incarcerated. Shortly after the Fall of France, the remaining Belgian soldiers in captivity were deported to prisoner-of-war camps (Kriegsgefangenenlager) in Germany, Austria and Poland. For the Germans, the Belgian prisoners represented a source of cheap labor which could be used in agriculture and factories after the conscription of most German workers. Belgian prisoners were again segregated by rank, with officers being sent to Oflags (an abbreviation for Offizierslager) and NCOs and other ranks being sent to Stalag (or Stammlager) camps. Around 225,000 soldiers, representing around 30 percent of the total force mobilised in 1940, were deported in this way. Most of these soldiers were from the pre-war professional army, rather than conscripts mobilized in 1940. Most of those in captivity (around 145,000) were Flemish, with only 80,000 Walloons. The exact number of prisoners, however, is not known, and there are a variety of estimates. Most Belgian prisoners were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture. Conditions were variable, but around 2,000 died in captivity, mostly from diseases and lack of medical attention. Gradually, more prisoners were released, but around 64,000 Belgian soldiers were still in captivity by 1945, of whom just 2,000 were Flemish. According to estimates compiled for the Nuremberg Trials, 53,000 were still incarcerated in 1945 at the end of the war, but there could have been as many as 70,000 according to some estimates. Of the prisoners released in 1945, one quarter were suffering from debilitating diseases, particularly tuberculosis. Effect in occupied Belgium Charity collections in honor of the prisoners were common in occupied Belgium. The postal service in occupied Belgium issued sets of semi- postal stamps from 1942 \\"for the benefit of the prisoners of war\\" and their families. Release and repatriation=Repatriation and escape Initially, the German Military Administration in Belgium viewed the continued detention of all Belgian prisoners as temporary and undesirable. Both Alexander von Falkenhausen, head of the Military Administration, and Eggert Reeder, responsible for the civilian administration, viewed the continued detention and segregation of Belgian prisoners by ethnicity as unnecessarily divisive and harmful to civil order in Belgium. On 15 July 1940, the Military Administration even announced the imminent release of all Belgian prisoners, although this was later condemned as a mistake. The detention of prisoners who worked in specialist jobs in civilian life created numerous problems in Belgium until all prisoners in specialist occupations were released. Because the Germans did not round up escaped prisoners once returned home, attempts to escape were relatively common. A total of 6,770 attempted escapes from camps in Germany are known. Flamenpolitik Repatriation of Belgian prisoners of war in Chiny, 1945 From the start of the detentions, the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler were directly concerned in policy relating to the Belgian prisoners of war. From the start of the invasion, German soldiers had orders to segregate Flemish soldiers from their Walloon counterparts. The release of all Flemish soldiers already in captivity was ordered on 6 June 1940, but only had a limited real effect. The favourable treatment of Flemish prisoners of war formed part of the (Flemish Policy). The policy had a racial foundation, since Nazi ideology argued that the Flemish were Germanic and therefore racially superior to the Walloons. It also hoped to encourage Flemish people to view Germany more favourably, paving the way for an intended annexation of the Greater Netherlands into the Greater Germanic Reich (Großgermanisches Reich). The Germans began actively repatriating Flemish prisoners of war in August 1940. By February 1941, 105,833 Flemish soldiers had been repatriated. Recognition A total of 165,000 soldiers received the brevet des prisonniers after the war, acknowledging their continued status as war veterans during their captivity. A medal, the Prisoner of War Medal 1940–1945, was established in 1947.

It used to be a Protestant chapel at a cemetery.  History  The chapel was built in 1896 at what was then the Lutheran parish cemetery of St. Paul. When the cemetery was closed in 1946, the municipal authorities allowed the chapel to serve as a temporary place of worship. In 1948, the chapel became the home of the Polish National Church, Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Over the years, the local authorities denied all requests to either enlarge the chapel or demolish it. The congregation decided to construct a new church in a different location in the city. The last Sunday service in the chapel took place in 2003.  Description  The chapel is a brick Neo-Gothic building with one nave and a shallow chancel. From the street, the nave is preceded by a vestibule. The choir is covered with a cross vault; the nave has open timbered roof trusses. The interior of the nave is illuminated by the arched window. The chapel originally housed the cemetery morgue, a large arcade in the rear of the present sacristy. The chapel interior contains furnishings that were recycled from inactive evangelical churches around the province. In 1953, the congreation installed a plaque commemorating minister Gustav Manitius. In 1965 the interior was modernized, new decor was installed in the chancel, and new windows instlled.

Mountaineering career=Beginning Armstrong started his career as mountain climber at the age of 6 after watching a documentary about hiking. After finding out that the youngest person that ever climbed Mount Whitney was 9 years, Armstrong started to train every day and soon started to climb his first mountains. Armstrong has hiked in ice, snow, rain, and heat. He has dealt with altitude sickness and hiking in the dark. Armstrong carries most of his own gear including poles, water, food, and clothing. His workout consists of running 4.5 miles on hills and walking an hour a day on a treadmill. He also hikes every month with his father. ExpeditionsMount Whitney (July 26, 2011) – 14,495 feet= Mount Whitney is the highest in the lower 48 After months of training, Armstrong climbed Mount Whitney in a single day on July 26, 2011. At 7 years old, he might be the youngest boy to climb the mountain, with a 6-year old girl, Eva Luna Harper-Zahn, summiting in 2018. Starting at the base camp, his 11-mile hike to the top, with an elevation gain of more than 6000 feet, took him 7 hours and 50 minutes. =Mount Kilimanjaro (July 1, 2012) – 19,341 feet= Although Mount Kilimanjaro had a minimum age limit of 10 years old, Tyler obtained a special permit to climb to the top. He took the Lemosho Route, which took him eight days of climbing round trip. In those eight days, he hiked 48.5 miles and gained 10,644 feet of elevation. On July 1, 2012, Tyler was the second youngest person to reach the top at the age of 8. =Mount Aconcagua (December 24, 2013) – 22,837 feet= After reaching the top of Kilimanjaro, Armstrong started to look for a new challenge, which he found in Argentina. Mount Aconcagua was his new target, and being the youngest person to climb it was his goal. As a training exercise, he climbed Mount Baldy on August 17, 2013, as part of the fifth annual Climb to Cure Duchenne. After months of preparation, Armstrong was ready for his journey to Argentina. On December 7, he left the United States. He spent his first couple of days trying to get a special permit because the minimum age for climbing Mount Aconcagua is 14. After obtaining a special permit, Armstrong started his climb on December 15, taking the Polish Glacier Traverse Route. On December 24, 2013, Armstrong reached the top and broke the record for being the youngest person to climb Mount Aconcagua, at the age of 9, making headlines all over the world. =Denali (June 2016) — 20,310 ft (6190 m)= Denali with Wonder Lake in the foreground At the age of 12, Tyler was denied a permit to climb Everest in the spring of 2016.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy awareness When Armstrong was climbing Mount Whitney with his parents, he met a boy crippled by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Armstrong made it his goal to help find a cure for the disease and partnered with the CureDuchenne Foundation. By climbing mountains, he hopes to raise money and awareness for this disease. By the summer of 2016 he had raised 25,000 for this disease out of a goal of one million dollars (USD). Several hundred thousand people, mostly boys are afflicted by DMD, which is a fatal genetic disorder that typically cripples the afflicted by their teens and it is rare for them to make it to 30. In addition to climbing he also hosted a special fund-raising movie presentation of Everest, with proceeds going to CureDuchenne foundation. Book Armstrong is featured in a book called Stand Up! This anthology features stories by 75 of the world’s most dynamic young activists who share their amazing experiences. Armstrong's story is called “Kilimanjaro for a Cause!” and it is in the Adventures Seekers chapter of the book.

He concentrated on athletics after an incident in fifth grade in which classmates teased him for remaining in costume and makeup after a drama competition. According to Mertens, the environment at Southridge High School was \\"hostile\\", as he was surround by a culture of homophobia. He said the Tri-Cities was not the most friendly area toward the LGBT community.

Starting with his sophomore year in high school, Mertens was active in Young Life, a national organization that preaches Christianity to youth. After being in trouble in his freshman year, he credited Young Life with turning his life around. In his senior year, Mertens was named the placekicker on the Tri- City Herald All-Area second team.

His dissertation, written under Herbert Fingarette, linked studies of philosophical themes in literature [ Dostoevsky, The Book of Job] with the turn toward persons in the work of Austin, P. F. Strawson and Iris Murdoch. Mooney was a Professor of Philosophy at Sonoma State University from 1975 until 2002. While there he published books on Kierkegaard and several smaller studies. He then migrated to Syracuse University where his writing expanded to include studies of American Philosophy (Cavell, Bugbee, Wilshire, Thoreau, and others). Mooney was President of the North American Kierkegaard Society for several years, in which capacity he lectured in Vilnia, Frankfurt, Reykjavik, Jerusalem, Ber-Shiva, Tel Aviv, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Auburn, and elsewhere.

He presently resides and teaches in Portland, Maine. He was a regular contributor to the interdisciplinary on-line journal Zeteo. His writing exemplifies the intersections among philosophy, religion, and poetry. One finds the clarity of Anglophone ordinary language philosophy joined to issues native to existential philosophy and religion. In recent years he has turned to Melville as exemplifying an informal and episodic conversationally developed philosophy well-suited to literary exposition and wisdom, embodying what Cavell calls \\"passionate speech.\\" His work has appeared in Japanese, Portuguese, French, Hebrew, and Spanish translation.

It is also called ; Turkish: Şark Buhranı (\\"Eastern Crisis\\", for the crisis in general), Ramazan Kararnamesi (\\"Decree of Ramadan\\", for the sovereign default declared on 30 October 1875) and 93 Harbi (\\"War of 93\\", for the wars on the Balkan peninsula between 1877–78, referring in particular to the Russo-Turkish War, the year 1293 on the Islamic Rumi calendar corresponding to the year 1877 on the Gregorian calendar). Background The Batak massacre carried out by Ottoman irregular troops in Bulgaria in 1876. The Avenger: An Allegorical War Map for 1877 by Fred. W. Rose, 1872: This map reflects the \\"Great Eastern Crisis\\" and the subsequent Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while at the same time managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. Bosnia suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850. Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and irredentist sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and its agents. Ottoman economic crisis and default On 24 August 1854,Dünya Bülteni: \\"Osmanlı Devleti ilk kez dış borç aldı\\"Derin Strateji: \\"Osmanlı Borçları ve Düyun-u Umumiye İdaresi\\"Yazarport: \\"Kırım Savaşı ve İlk Dış Borçlanma (1854-1855)\\" during the Crimean War, the Ottoman Empire took its first foreign loans.Douglas Arthur Howard: \\"The History of Turkey\\", page 71.Mevzuat Dergisi, Yıl: 9, Sayı: 100, Nisan 2006: \\"Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda ve Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Borçlanma Politikaları ve Sonuçları\\" The empire entered into subsequent loans, partly to finance the construction of railways and telegraph lines, and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditures of the imperial court, such as the construction of new palaces on the Bosphorus strait in Constantinople. Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the British and French banks (owned by the Rothschild family) which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.Gold for the Sultan: Western Bankers and Ottoman Finance, 1856–1881, by Christopher Clay, London, 2001, p. 30. A large amount of money was also spent for building new ships for the Ottoman Navy during the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–1876). In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, which formed the third largest naval fleet in the world after those of the British and French navies. All of these expenditures, however, put a huge strain on the Ottoman treasury. In the meantime, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare a sovereign default on its foreign loan repayments on 30 October 1875 and increase taxes in all of its provinces, including the Balkans. Uprisings and wars in the Balkans The decision to increase taxes for paying the Ottoman Empire's debts to foreign creditors resulted in outrage in the Balkan provinces, which culminated in the Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration was established in 1881, which gave the control of the Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors. This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the OPDA for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.Pllana, Emin (1985). \\"Les raisons de la manière de l'exode des refugies albanais du territoire du sandjak de Nish a Kosove (1878–1878) [The reasons for the manner of the exodus of Albanian refugees from the territory of the Sanjak of Niš to Kosovo (1878–1878)] \\".

Aftermath After the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, Austria-Hungary stationed military garrisons in the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia and Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which formally (de jure) continued to be Ottoman territories. Taking advantage of the chaos that occurred during the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, Bulgaria declared its formal independence on 5 October 1908. The following day, Austria-Hungary unilaterally annexed Bosnia on 6 October 1908, but pulled its military forces out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise with the Ottoman government and avoid a war (the Ottoman Empire lost the Sanjak of Novi Pazar with the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913.) In 1881, France occupied the Ottoman Beylik of Tunisia, with the excuse that Tunisian troops had crossed the border into their colony of Algeria, which also formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1830. A year later, in 1882, the British Empire occupied the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt, with the pretext of giving military assistance to the Ottomans for putting down the Urabi Revolt (Britain later declared Egypt a British protectorate on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman government's decision to join World War I on the side of the Central Powers.Articles 17, 18 and 19 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)) It is worth noting that the Ottoman government had frequently declared the tax revenues from Egypt as a surety for borrowing loans from British and French banks. The Ottoman government had earlier leased Cyprus to Britain in 1878, in exchange for British support at the Congress of Berlin in the same year (Cyprus was later annexed by Britain on 5 November 1914, for the same aforementioned reason regarding the Ottoman participation in World War I.Articles 20 and 21 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)) By obtaining Cyprus and Egypt, Britain gained an important foothold in the East Mediterranean and control over the Suez Canal; while France increased its lands in the West Mediterranean coast of North Africa by adding Tunisia to its empire as a French protectorate.

The district includes four houses as well as the sites of two demolished homes. The historic district was once a prestigious area of the city known as \\"Quality Hill\\", and it contained well-built homes designed in popular architectural styles. However, East St. Louis entered a severe decline due to the loss of its industry, racial discrimination, and a corrupt and mismanaged city government. The historic district suffered the same fate as the city; the district is marked by vacant lots and abandoned buildings, and all but one of the houses had been vacated or demolished by the 1970s. As of 1979, four houses were still standing in the district; all four are contributing buildings. The Joyce House, located at 1005 Pennsylvania Avenue, is a Renaissance Revival house built in 1901. The Katherine Dunham Museum now occupies the house; it is the only house in the district which is still occupied. The John A. Campbell House, located at 1023 Pennsylvania Avenue, is a 1907 Queen Anne house designed by Albert B. Frankel. The Malburn M.

She was the personal chamber maid and influential confidante of Princess Hedvig Sophia of Sweden and known for her influence and political activity. Juliana Schierberg was employed as a chamber maid to Queen Ulrika Eleonora in 1681, and was given the same position to the eldest Princess, Hedvig Sophia, upon the death of the queen in 1693. She had a similar position with Hedvig Sophia as Emerentia von Düben had with the younger Princess, Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, and acted as the political adviser of the Princess. Various foreign diplomats contributed the fact that the marriage alliance between Denmark and Sweden, which was to take place with a marriage between Hedvig Sophia and Prince Charles of Denmark and Charles XII of Sweden and Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, did not take place, was because of her influence, as was that the fact Hedvig Sophia did not marry William III of England but the Duke of Holstein in 1698. In 1702, she played the same important part in the marriage negotiations regarding the expected new marriage of Hedvig Sophia after her widowhood. Juliana Schierberg reportedly accepted bribes and had a net of spies to work for the benefit of the Princess, and influential people unsuccessfully tried to have her removed from court because of her influence. In 1708, a party consisting of Fritze, a favorite servant of Hedvig Sophia, and the two ladies-in-waiting Maria Horn and Charlotta von Liewen tried to have her removed from court by saying to the Princess that Schierberg had become senile, but as Schierberg as a chamber maid slept in the same room as the Princess and had access to her all the time this did not succeed. In 1708, Hedvig Sophia died of smallpox. Gossip accused Schierberg to have caused her death by exposing her to superstitious medical treatments and letting no one in to the sickbed of the Princess except Maria Horn, neither the överhovmästarinna Märta Berendes nor the doctor. Juliana Schierberg retired with a fortune after the death of Hedvig Sophia, which is proven by the fact that she was able to donate a great sum to finance the Great Nordic War in 1710.

He is a leg spin bowler who also bats right-handed. Youth career As a child, Zampa bowled medium pace, but Cricket Australia had placed restrictions on how many pace bowlers were allowed to bowl in under-14 matches, so he decided to change his bowling style to leg spin, inspired by Australian Test cricketer Shane Warne. Zampa made his way into Australia's under-19 team in 2009 and has earned a rookie contract with the Blues in 2010 after playing a role by representing Australia in their successful 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup campaign. Zampa played in two youth Test matches and eight youth ODIs, taking 11 wickets across the two formats. Domestic career (2010–2016)=In New South Wales (2010–2013) As a result of Zampa's youth career for Australia, he was given a rookie contract with New South Wales in 2010, but he didn't get any opportunities to prove himself at state-level because New South Wales also had a number of other successful spin bowlers, such as Nathan Hauritz, Steve O'Keefe and Steve Smith. He did get another opportunity to represent Australia before his first-class debut, playing in the 2011 Hong Kong Cricket Sixes. Zampa made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the 2012–13 Sheffield Shield season against Queensland. He took five wickets in a three-wicket win. Despite not having a contract with a Big Bash League team until a week before BBL02 began, he played for the Sydney Thunder and was highly rated by Trevor Hohns. He finished the season having played three first-class matches, taking ten wickets at an average of 23 runs per wicket. In South Australia (2013–2016) After the season he accepted an offer to play for South Australia, in both first-class and one-day matches and for South Australia's Twenty20 team, the Adelaide Strikers. He was tempted by the guaranteed starts he would get in South Australia's team as they had just lost Test spinner Nathan Lyon to New South Wales. During the 2013 winter, he spent three months training at the Centre of Excellence before joining the South Australian squad for the 2013–14 season. The move to South Australia proved a useful one for progressing Zampa's career as he had the opportunity to work with experienced South African spinner Johan Botha, who was the captain of the South Australian side at the time of his move. Zampa had an impressive performance in the 2014–15 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, getting on a hat-trick and taking overall figures of 4/18 despite South Australia losing the match to Western Australia. In 2015, Zampa signed on for the Redbacks for two more seasons, but in order to get more experience, he changed Twenty20 sides to the Melbourne Stars, where he would have the opportunity to play alongside international stars Michael Clarke and Kevin Pietersen. The 2015–16 summer was the most successful of Zampa's career to that point. He impressed in both List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket, and in 2016, was included in Australia's squad for both One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, but he struggled in first- class cricket. In the 2015–16 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, he recorded figures of 4/48 against Cricket Australia XI to help take South Australia into the tournament's elimination final. In BBL05, he was part of an unusual dismissal, running out Peter Nevill with his nose. International career (2016–present) He made his ODI debut on 6 February 2016 in the second match of 2015–16 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy series. He made his Twenty20 International debut for Australia against South Africa on 4 March 2016. Zampa became a regular member of both the ODI and T20I squad for Australia. Zampa was named in Australia's squad for the 2016 World Twenty20 before he'd made his T20I debut for Australia in South Africa. Despite how recently he'd been added to the squad, he was Australia's leading wicket-taker with five wickets at an average of 13.80 and an economy rate of 6.27, including a breakout performance against Bangladesh with figures of 3/23. With Zampa's rise to Australia's national team he also started to play in Twenty20 franchises as an overseas player. Playing for Rising Pune Supergiant in the Indian Premier League against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he took 6 wickets for 19 runs and ranked as the third best performance as a bowler in the history of the IPL after 6/14 by Sohail Tanvir and 6/12 by Alzarri Joseph. Zampa bowled his first over for the match in the 8th over of Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings, but was taken out of the attack immediately without taking a wicket. He wasn't brought back on until the 16th over, in which he took one wicket. Captain MS Dhoni gave him an extended spell after his wicket, and he took two wickets in the 18th over and three more wickets in the 20th over, bringing his total to six. He was named man of the match for his performance, and this was also the record for the best bowling figures by a bowler in Twenty20 history in a losing cause. Zampa also played in the Caribbean Premier League for the Guyana Amazon Warriors, taking the most wickets out of all spin bowlers for the tournament with 15 wickets at an average of 18.46. Zampa was surprisingly dropped from Australia's Twenty20 side for the second match of a three-match series against Sri Lanka in 2016–17 after bowling well in the series opener and taking two wickets. Zampa described being dropped as a \\"kick in the guts\\", saying his recent form indicated he was one of the best Twenty20 spin bowlers in the world. Without Zampa Australia lost both the match and the series. Zampa was brought back into the side for the final match of the series, and he was named the man of the match with 3/25 as Australia won the game. Despite all of Zampa's successes in the shorter forms of cricket, he was still unable to break into Australia's Test side. He was unable to reach exceptional form in the Sheffield Shield, being a victim of South Australia's very strong pace attack, with Chadd Sayers and Kane Richardson taking all of the wickets themselves and not leaving opportunities for Zampa to stand out. Australia played a Test series in India in early 2017, and former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming touted him as a possible addition to Australia's squad given his ability to bowl well on Indian pitches, but he was not included in the squad. Instead, Zampa continued playing in the Sheffield Shield and had his first five-wicket haul in a first-class innings when he took career-best figures of 6/62 in the first innings against Queensland before taking another four wickets in the second innings to accomplish his first ten-wicket haul in a first-class match.

Production  Following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942, Tan's Film was shut down. During the occupation all films produced were works of propaganda, and after the Indonesian National Revolution began in 1945 no new films were made. In 1948 the owners of Tan's Film, the brothers Tan Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian, worked with brothers Joshua and Othniel Wong to establish the Tan & Wong Bros Film Company. They soon began production of their first film, Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum. The film was written and directed by Roestam Sutan Palindih, a journalist-cum-writer who had directed two short films during the Japanese occupation. Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum starred Sofia, her husband S Waldy (pseudonym of Waldemar Caerel Hunter), and Rd Endang all had had experience on stage during the Occupation. Air Mata Mengalir dari Tjitarum was the feature film debut of Sofia and Rd Endang.; . The black-and-white film's sound and cinematography was split between the Wong brothers.  Release and reception  Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum was released in 1948, and at least one advertisement took advantage of the lasting star power of Roekiah, who had been the main draw of Tan's Film; the advertisement included the line \\"Roekiah? No! But Sofia in a new Indonesian film, Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum\\". The film was the second domestic feature production since the end of the occupation, following Andjar Asmara's Djaoeh Dimata for the South Pacific Film Corporation. Both films had similar themes, but ultimately Air Mata dari Tjitarum was the bigger box-office hit.  Legacy  Roestam did not direct Tan & Wong Bros next production, Bengawan Solo (1949), and only wrote one further film, Terang Bulan (1950). He spent much of his later life as documentarian. Sofia and Waldy acted in several further films together, including Bengawan Solo, and both later went into directing; they divorced in 1964. Rd Endang remained a popular star until 1956, when he left the film industry. Tan & Wong Bros produced several further films after the release of Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum; in 1955 they changed the company's name to Tjendrawasih Film. The film is probably lost. As was the case in the rest of the world, movies in the East Indies were shot on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, many films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, J.B. Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

It was established from a sum of £20000 left by Thomas Brown in his will. It was intended to be a centre for veterinary research and its early work was mainly in disease and physiology. It also served as a veterinary hospital. Seven out of its eight directors became Fellows of the Royal Society. In the late 1870s, the institute became a target of the anti-vivisection movement in England and the building on Wandsworth road was destroyed by German bombs in 1944.  History  Mr Thomas Brown of Rosey Park Hill, Dublin who lived in London died in 1852. Brown's Will stated the purpose of his bequest for \\"founding, establishing and upholding an Institution for investigating, studying and, without charge beyond immediate expenses, endeavouring to cure maladies, distempers and injuries any quadrupeds or birds useful to man may be subject to, for and towards which purpose of founding, establishing and upholding such animal sanatory institution within a mile of either Westminster, Southwark or Dublin.” The funds were transferred to the University of London in 1858 and accumulated interest till 1871 to a value of £33,781. John Burdon-Sanderson was appointed as superintendent and because the Mortmain Act prevent purchase of land using the trust fund, a site of 1.5 acres was purchased with a £2000 gift from John Cunliffe of Lombard Street and £500 from Burdon-Sanderson. The land was on Wandsworth Road. The institute was opened in 1871. The single large building had one basement floor accessible by a trapdoor from the apparatus room. A description by William Bulloch in 1925 notes: > \\"If one takes a tram from Westminster Bridge along the Embankment past > “Lambeth Palace and Doultons and underneath an ugly railway bridge across > the Wandsworth Road one reaches (No. 149) a small archway on which is graven > the legend “The Brown Sanatory Institution founded 1871.” On entering, one > comes to a stable yard and, behind, a low building of one storey. This is > the famous “Brown” now falling, sad to say, into a considerable state of > decay and uncared for.\\" The institute was supported by John Simon (1816-1904) pathologist and medical officer in the board of health for London. Among the researchers who worked at the institute was a Viennese scientist, Emanuel Edward Klein, sometimes considered the father of British bacteriology. The research he and his colleagues conducted at the Institution were published as in 1873 as the Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory along with John Burdon-Sanderson, Michael Foster, and Thomas Lauder Brunton. Their experiments included vivisection of animals, and following widespread protests, led to an enquiry in 1875, the Royal Commission on Vivisection for Scientific Purposes, chaired by Lord Cardwell and which resulted in the establishment of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. Activists writing in the press pointed out that a founding principle, \\"kindness to animals is a general principle of the Institution\\" was hardly followed. The Superintendents of the Brown Institution were: * Burdon- Sanderson (1871-1878) * W. S. Greenfield (1878-1881) * C. S. Roy (1881 - 1884) * Victor Horsley (1884 - 1891) * C. S. Sherrington (1891-1895) * J. Rose Bradford (1895-1903) * T. G. Brodie (1903-1909) * F. W. Twort (1909- ?) Among the other researchers who worked there were Charles Creighton, L.C. Wooldridge, W. G. Spencer, Charles Ballance, Arthur Edmunds, George Makins, A. E. Wright, Charles Plimmer and E. Mellanby. The institution also served as a veterinary hospital with nearly 4000 cases being seen in its first two decades and 8000 in the second twenty years. The hospital was closed in 1939 but even before that it went into a steady decline with only about 1000 cases a year. The decline was due in part to a ban on pets in flats in the neighbourhood and the rise of motorized transport which led to a decline in horses. The first veterinary assistant was William Duguid. The rise of the Lister Institute is thought to have aided the decline of the Brown Institution.

Born in Rugby, Garton left school at the age of fourteen to undertake an apprenticeship as a blacksmith, but later studied electrical engineering at the Rugby College of Technology. He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was also active in the Labour Guild of Youth, although a local vicar condemned him for leading moonlight rambles including both men and women. At the 1929 United Kingdom general election, he stood as the Labour Party candidate for Warwick and Leamington, taking third place with 16% of the vote. During the campaign, the Leamington Courier described him as \\"a revolutionary in the matter of dress . . . wearing in winter and summer alike an open-necked tennis shirt and no hat\\". Garton stood again at the 1931 United Kingdom general election. He was unable to win the backing of either the Labour Party or the ILP, but was supported by the local Constituency Labour Party. Against a single opponent, he managed only 19.4% of the vote. He served as the Midlands District representative on the ILP's National Administrative Committee from 1931, and in 1932 moved the motion arguing that the ILP should remain affiliated to the Labour Party provided that certain conditions were met - hoping that the Labour Party was moving to the left and would agree to them. This position was approved at the ILP's conference, but the conditions were not met, and so the ILP disaffiliated. Late in 1933, Garton moved to Moscow, to work for the All Union Electro- technical Institute. The following year, he spoke at the ILP's summer school in support of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the ILP's Revolutionary Policy Committee. He remained in Russia until 1937, when he returned to the UK, to become a research officer with the Electrical Research Association, then served as head of its materials department from 1946, retiring in 1966. Garton wrote a number of publications on electrical engineering. He was made a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The Garton Effect is named for him.

Career Born in Hulme, Garvey began his career with Wigan County in the Lancashire League. He joined Newton Heath in May 1900 as a replacement for Scotland international goalkeeper Frank Barrett, who had moved to New Brighton Tower. He made his Football League debut in the opening game of the 1900–01 season away to Glossop; he conceded just one goal, but Newton Heath were unable to score themselves and they lost 1–0. Garvey kept a clean sheet in Newton Heath's next game, a 4–0 home win over Middlesbrough, but was replaced for the next game by Jimmy Whitehouse, newly signed from Grimsby Town. He only made four more appearances before the end of the season, one of these coming as a result of Whitehouse's selection as an emergency forward against Walsall. He spent most of the rest of the season in the club's reserve team; one notable appearance in December 1900 saw him save a penalty as Newton Heath – whose team consisted of just nine men – held Glossop to a 1–1 draw. Having failed to establish himself in the Newton Heath first team, he left the club for non-league Middleton in June 1901. After a spell with Stalybridge Rovers, he joined Southport Central ahead of the 1902–03 season. In December 1902, he returned to Newton Heath (now known as Manchester United) with Southport when they were drawn together in the third qualifying round of the 1902–03 FA Cup; although Manchester United won 4–1, Garvey had a good game, saving a penalty from Jack Peddie to keep the score relatively respectable. In March 1904, he was part of the Southport team that reached the final of the Lancashire Senior Cup, where they lost 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers at Deepdale in Preston. He returned to the Football League with Bradford City in February 1905. He made 22 league appearances for Bradford before suffering a career-ending injury in a game against Stockport County in November 1905.

The term combines the word \\"lad,\\" which refers to a boy or young man and \\"lit,\\" which is short for \\"literature.\\" The term \\"lad lit\\" can be used as a noun to refer to the genre of fiction (about young men and their emotional and personal lives), or as a modifier (e.g., \\"lad-lit novels\\"). Description Lad lit typically concerns itself with the trials and tribulations of urban twenty and thirty something men, faced with changing heterosexual mores and the pursuit of a desired lifestyle. The stories revolve around issues like male identity crisis and masculine insecurity in relationships as a result of the social pressures and the expectations of how they should behave in work, love and life, men’s fear and final embrace of marriage<\\"Ladlit\\". by Elaine Showalter in On Modern Fiction ed. by Zachary Leader and published by Oxford University Press.

Several publishers, encouraged by the increasing sales of glossy magazines (Maxim, Esquire, GQ, FHM), believed that such fiction would open up a new readership. Thus, lad lit is not its own phenomenon, but rather part of a larger cultural and socioeconomic movement. This new publishing category ostensibly sought to redefine masculinity.The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (3 ed.)by Chris Baldick; The protagonist of these books is the young man on the make, mindlessly pursuing booze, babes and football. His ineptitude, drunken-ness and compulsive materialism were part of his charm.Ladlit -- an essay by Elaine Showalter that appears in On Modern Fiction edited by Zachary Leader and published by Oxford University Press. The figure was created in contrast with the New Man of the feminist era and, beneath the crass surface, the lads are attractive, funny, bright, observant, inventive, charming and excruciatingly honest. They are characters who seem to deserve more from life and romance than they are getting.< Lad lit has been mistakenly believed to be a backlash against the chick lit phenomena,The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (3 ed.)by Chris Baldick; due to its later arrival in the USA, but academics, such as E. Showalter and N. Danford, have extended the term to cover earlier fictions, including Martin Amis’s The Rachel Papers(1973) and Bret Easton Ellis’s Less Than Zero (1985) and The Rules of Attraction (1987). Providing the most comprehensive definition of lad literature, Showalter links the modern publishing category to its roots in 1950s British literature: :Stretching from Kingsley to Martin Amis, Ladlit was comic in the traditional sense that it had a happy ending. It was romantic in the modern sense that it confronted men’s fear and final embrace of marriage and adult responsibilities. It was confessional in the postmodern sense that the male protagonists and unreliable first-person narrators betrayed beneath their bravado the story of their insecurities, panic, cold sweats, performance anxieties and phobias. At the low end of the market, Ladlit was the masculine equivalent of the Bridget Jones Phenomenon; at the high end of the high street, it was a masterly examination of male identity in contemporary Britain\\". Authors Nick Hornby is considered to be the originator of the genre. His early novels, Fever Pitch (1992), High Fidelity (1995) and About a boy (1997), each have a protagonist dominated by a typically masculine obsession (football, pop music, gadgetry) that reflects his inability to communicate with women. Other authors associated with this new wave of fiction include: Tony Parsons, Man and Boy (1999); Tim Lott, White City Blue (1999); Mike Gayle, My Legendary Girlfriend (1999); Mark Barrowcliffe, Girlfriend 44 (2000); Matt Dunn, The Ex-Boyfriend’s Handbook (2006); Danny Wallace, Yes Man (2008); Kyle Smith, \\"Love Monkey\\" (2009); Zack Love, \\"Sex in the Title\\" (2013).

It is situated on the site of ancient Pheia, at a bay opposite the islet of Ichthys or Tiganonisi and the island of Zakynthos. Agios Andreas is located 13 kilometers northwest of Pyrgos and approximately 2 km from the port of Katakolo. It owes its name to an old church, now ruined, dedicated to Andrew the Apostle, who is said to have passed from the place on his journeys. The church was built on the ruins of an ancient temple, which was rebuilt in 1930.  History  The ancient town of Pheia occupied the site of the modern village of Agios Andreas, most of which today lies submerged in the sea. Dating back to Homeric times, it is mentioned twice by Homer (Iliad, VIII.135, Odyssey, XV.297, 298), Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War (II.25), in Xenophon's Hellenica (3, 2, 30), Strabo's Geographica (VIII.343), as well as the works of Polybius and Pausanias. Pheia was sunk by an earthquake in the 6th century AD,https://web.archive.org/web/20140802123146/http://www.ciesm.org/online/monographs/Santorin.pdf the same which largely destroyed the city of Patras, and which is credited with the final ruin of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and probably with the formation of Lake Agoulinitsa (in Epitalio). In Byzantine times, a fortress, Pontikon or Pontikokastro, was built on the site of the ruined ancient acropolis. Archaeological excavations in the area were undertaken in 1957 by Nikos Gialouris, and the findings are exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia. They include ostraca from prehistoric up to Roman times, clay lamps, bowls, cylixes, amphorae, columns, an Archaic-era kouros from Naxos, and Cycladic statues, all testimonies to the site's role as a major port. An extensive Roman-era cemetery was also found on the islet of Ιchthys or Tiganonisi. However, most of the graves were found looted. After the Fourth Crusade, the castle was conquered by the Frankish Crusaders who established the Principality of Achaea in ca. 1205. Known as Beauvoir in French, Belveder in Italian and Bellovidere or Pulchrumvidere in Latin, it originally formed part of the princely domain of Achaea, and along with the fortress and princely mint of Glarentza it was one of the two major sites from which Elis was governed. Beauvoir was granted in 1289 to Hugh, Count of Brienne, in exchange for his half of the Barony of Karytaina, but Hugh soon exchanged it with John Chauderon for lands in Conversano. By 1303, however, it had returned to direct princely control. During Ferdinand of Majorca's attempt to seize the Principality in 1315–16, Beauvoir was captured and held by his forces until after his defeat and death in the Battle of Manolada. Beauvoir ceased to play an important role thereafter, and is scarcely mentioned in the subsequent periods of Ottoman and Venetian rule. In 1391 it was taken over by the Navarrese Company, in 1427 by Constantine Palaiologos, and after that by Thomas Palaiologos. It was burned down by the Turks in 1470.

The defined Battle of River Canard is the first skirmish that occurred in a series of small fights, and was the first example of armed conflict in Canada resulting from the War of 1812. An American force of 280 men under Colonels Cass and Miller skirmished with a British force under Lieutenant-Colonel T.B. St. George, consisting of the British 41st Regiment, Indians and Canadian militia, near the bridge. A generalized account of the battle would model after the outcome of the War of 1812, the Battle of Canard technically yielded no winner. American forces drove British soldiers back into a nearby fort, Fort Malden, but the next day Americans abandoned the ground gained. However, a more specific account suggests American victory. Before the battle, American General William HulI ordered Colonel Cass to scout for British troops. Cass encountered British outposts, and quickly maneuvered to flank the British allied forces consisting of members of the 41st Regiment, under the command of Colonel T.B. St. George. Cass's quick flank proved successful, and forced the British troops to retreat to Fort Malden. Cass's flank also opened a route to British controlled Amherstburg, but aware of the distance between the American main force and the troops that won the battle, General Hull ordered American retreat. During the first skirmish, two British soldiers, James Hancock and John Dean were captured. Hancock would die of his wounds later in the day, becoming the first British casualty of the war. Dean was taken prisoner to Detroit where his left arm was amputated due to wounds. He would be liberated with the capture of Fort Detroit by the British one month later. Both Hancock and Dean were commended by the presiding administrator, Sir Isaac Brock.

He qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics in the 4-man discipline. Life and career Tasker was born in 1987 in Lawrenny, Wales. When young, Tasker was a talented athlete, which led to his joining the Carmarthen Harriers athletics club at the age of 11. Specialising in the 100m, 200m and 400m disciplines, he broke club records as a youth and won at both distances at several meets, including the Welsh Championship, where he won the 200m at Swansea in 2008, and the BUSA Championships, the 400m in Bedford in 2007. In 2006 he was ranked as the United Kingdom's top under-20s athlete in the indoor 400m. Despite this he failed to reach the top level of the sport and turned his back on sprinting in 2009. Tasker first competed for Great Britain at a competition at Loughborough, in 2006. After graduating with upper second class honours, in 2008, Tasker changed events to focus on the 200m, but after winning only a U23 British bronze medal, his interest in athletics was waning. In 2010, while studying for a degree in Biochemistry at the University of Bath, he was introduced to bobsleigh by British racer John James Jackson. He adapted swiftly to the sport and was part of the four-man team that came first at the 2011–12 British Championships held at Winterberg. Tasker was also part of the four-man teams which represented Great Britain at the 2013 World Championships, coming in fifth and the 2014 Bobsleigh European Championships, winning a silver medal. He was also part of the four-man crew that finished second at the Lake Placid World Cup meeting in 2013. On the 22 and 23 February 2014, Tasker represented Great Britain in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in the four-man bobsleigh; racing in the first team along with Stuart Benson, Joel Fearon and pilot John James Jackson in GBR1. It was his debut Olympics. GBR1 finished in fifth position, but in 2017 two Russian crews were disqualified for doping violations, pushing the British crew up to bronze. After the Sochi Olympics Tasker undertook training to become a bobsleigh pilot in the summer of 2014. In November 2017 at Park City, Tasker finished third in a four-man World Cup race alongside Bradley Hall, Joel Fearon and Greg Cackett. On 4 January 2018, he suffered a stroke, ruling him out of taking part at the 2018 Winter Olympics. After a career in which he competed at six World Championships and an Olympics, in October 2018 Tasker announced his retirement from competition. In March 2020, he took part in BBC1 cooking show Masterchef.

The film, produced and distributed by Concorde-New Horizons, was a Roger Corman production. Plot A controversial rock star Delilah, is hoping her new upcoming album will give her success after a previous two failed albums. After a topless cabaret/glam- metal performance at a local S&M; club, she finds a finger with a ring in a box left for her within the dressing room. The sender is a psychotic fan Robert Kell, a sexual predator/mercenary/ex-military man in town, who has returned to the area to seek revenge on various underworld mobsters who \\"left his men to die in Angola\\", during the Angolan War of Independence. This situation leads Delilah, and her lover/co-conspirator Reena, to seek a female bodyguard for protection. She has a dislike of the police, as her father was a cop, and he had once raped her. They seek undercover cop Brit Alwood, who agrees to take the case. However moments after the pair leaving Alwood's office, Brit is killed by Kell. When Brit's kid sister Jo finds out about the crime, she sets out for revenge and agrees to protect Delilah, assisted by her lover Aaron Sayles, who is a detective. Jo is pulled into the dark, erotic world of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, and is forced to confront the crazed mind of a vicious serial killer. The two scour the town, interrogating Vietnam veterans that might know Kell's whereabouts. At the same time Danny Marcus, Delilah's manager and abusive lover, starts causing problems for the talent when her record label owner Sonny Luso wants her to change her bad girl image. Sonny stands to lose $2 million if she won't change her image and the new album fails. He could collect $1.5 million on an insurance policy if she winds up dead – which leads to an assassination attempt that is thwarted by both Jo and Kell, who she believes is trying to save Delilah for a sick and twisted fantasy finale.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109125/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl Cast * Maria Ford as Jo Alwood * Charlie Spradling as Brit Alwood * Jessica Mark as Delilah * Antonio Bacci as Aaron Sayles * Chanda as Reena Jacobs * Jimmy Broome as Robert Kell * Bob McFarland as Sonny Luso * Chuck Moore as Chet Wailner * Timothy D.

He stated, \\"Angel of Destruction\\" stars female martial-arts expert Maria Ford in the title role. In the tradition of the \\"B\\" westerns of Yore, Ford sets out to avenge her sister's murderer. She's essentially a woman of peace, though she leaves a lot of her opponents in pieces. There's gore galore before she corners the killers, and it is for this reason, rather than the frequent glimpses of the leading lady's bare torso, that the film is rated R. The saving grace of \\"Angel of Destruction\\", for non-chopsocky fans, is the fact that Maria Ford actually has a soupcon of acting ability.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Glenn Kenny, gave the film a C- grade in a review published on June 17, 1994. He stated, \\"In \\"Angel of Destruction\\", direct-to-video sexpot Maria Ford swipes a leaf from Cynthia Rothrock's book and goes martial arts. Ford's twist? She occasionally kicks butt whilst half-naked. Mere words cannot do justice to the ludicrousness of Angel's plot, which commences with Ford deciding to avenge the murder of her sister and climaxes when she's forced to do a striptease act at the behest of a psychotic ex-mercenary. You've got to sit through it to not believe it.\\" In the book The Motion Picture Guide 1995 Annual: The Films of 1994, written by James Pallot and published by CineBooks, it was noted that, \\"all the elements of \\"Angel of Destruction\\" are so familiar that it's easy to think you've already seen it.\\" The 2006 book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, by Jim Craddock, gave the film one and a half stars. The Video Source Book of 2008, written by James M. Craddock and published by Thomson Gale, also gave the same rating.

Both projects were parallel but not linked with each other. The Unified Political Command was meant as a kind of transitional government which should prepare the gradual merger of Iraq with Egypt and North Yemen with Egypt in a new United Arab Republic. Egypt and Iraq Nasser with the Iraqi Prime Minister al-Bazzaz (left): Still in February 1966 the Egyptian-Iraqi Unified Political Command declared its satisfaction about the merger progress in both republics Therefore, on 26 May 1964 Nasser and Arif agreed to form a joint Presidential Council and a Unified Political Command on 16 October 1964. This Unified Command was established on 20 December 1964 and did include the prime ministers of Egypt and Iraq as well as the ministers of economical and financial affairs and social planning of both sides and should act as a joint supreme instrument and highest executive authority to establish the economical, political and military unification of Egypt and Iraq within two years. The Iraqi Abd ar-Razzaq Muhyi ad-Din (Abdel Razzaq Mohieddin) became General Secretary of the Unified Command. In July 1964 an Iraqi Arab Socialist Union was founded as political instrument to collect the support of the population and was formally united with the Egyptian Arab Socialist Union in September 1964. Also in September 1964 Egypt and Iraq agreed to unite their diplomatical corps and representations all over the world. In 1965 Iraq adopted the Egyptian coat of arms eagle and the Egyptian national anthem, declared Iraq as a democratic and socialist republic and announced a programme of nationalization. However, despite a few real meetings and sessions of this Unified Political Command the project stopped when the Nasserist prime minister of Iraq, Arif Abd ar-Razzaq, tried to overthrow president Arif in September 1965 and when Arif died in April 1966. Egypt and Yemen In July 1964 Nasser and Sallal agreed about the gradual merger of Egypt and Yemen towards a full union Parallelly, but not linked with the Egyptian-Iraqi merger project also between Nasser and as-Sallal a Unified Political Command was established on 13 July 1964. A joint government council of the Egyptian and Yemeni ministers should coordinate and integrate the Foreign, Defense, Economical, Social, Cultural and Information policy towards full unity. A (short-living) Yemeni Arab Socialist Union (later renamed) was established already in 1964 and, in fact, Egyptian generals and officers took over the command of the republican forces in Yemen during the North Yemen Civil War. This civil war, however, prevented any progress and when Egypt withdraw its troops from Yemen after the Six-Day War as-Sallal was overthrown in November 1967 and also this project definitively ended. Others Similar Unified Political Commands and Joint Supreme Committees were planned and formed *between the Syrian president Hafez al-Assad and king Hussein of Jordan in July 1975 in order to coordinate and push the military, political and economical integration of Syria and Jordan. The project failed when Syria re- approached Egypt within the Federation of Arab Republics in December 1976 *within the Egyptian-Libyan-Syrian Federation of Arab Republics between Egypt, Libya and Sudan in April 1970. Later Syria joined instead of Sudan, but Egypt and Libya agreed to let a Unified Political Command prepare a more substantial union within the federation. The Egyptian-Libyan merger failed 1973 but on 21 December 1976 and in February 1977 the Syrian president Assad and the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat agreed to form a new bilateral Unified Political Command and a Political Supreme Council. In March 1977 Sudan's president Gaafar Nimeiry joined that Unified Political Command and all three presidents announced to form a new Federation of Arab Republics which never was realized and finally collapsed in November 1977 with the begin of Egyptian-Israeli peace talks. *between Syria and Iraq in October 1978 when both sides agreed to improve their military and economical cooperation and even planned to form a Syrian-Iraqi Union.

It is among the earliest extant log churches in Hampshire County, along with Capon Chapel and Mount Bethel Church. The church was constructed in 1838 to serve as a nondenominational \\"union church\\". As many of the Mill Creek valley's earliest settlers were of German descent, Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents, known as \\"Dunkers\\" or \\"Dunkards\\". The church is believed to have also been a meeting place for German Methodist settlers. By 1870, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, and in 1878, the church's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations. Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907. Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. In 1968, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, due to its \\"significant settlement-era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands.\\" The church is a large, one-story, gablefront log building sheathed in brown-painted wooden German siding. The original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church, with some bark remaining on the logs. The church's interior ceiling measures approximately in height and is clad in pressed metal panels. Several of its pews date from 1857. In the church's adjoining cemetery, the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834, and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759. According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi, \\"Old Pine Church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area's early rural church complexes.\\" Geography and setting alt=Mill Creek viewed from Trinity Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 220/11) near Junction, northeast of Old Pine Church Old Pine Church and its cemetery are located along the steeply sloped Old Pine Church Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 220/15), approximately south of the unincorporated community of Purgitsville. The church and cemetery are situated on atop a bluff to the west of United States Route 220, at an elevation of . The property is surrounded by old-growth forests. The church is in a rural area of southwestern Hampshire County within the Mill Creek valley. Patterson Creek Mountain, a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises to the west of Mill Creek valley, and the forested western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Mill Creek Mountain rise to the valley's east. The Trough on the South Branch Potomac River is located across Mill Creek Mountain, approximately to the east of the church.  History  Old Pine Church seen from the cemetery garden  Background  Old Pine Church's land tract was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719. The church is in the Mill Creek valley. As tensions with Native Americans were beginning to ease, Lord Fairfax sought to entice white settlers to the sparsely settled lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary. The valley was one of the first parts of present- day Hampshire County to be settled by whites, beginning in the mid-18th century. Settlers were drawn by the valley's fertility. As the valley's population grew, the unincorporated community of Purgitsville developed along Mill Creek as a trading post village; it was named for Henry Purgitt (or Purgate), who acquired in the Mill Creek valley on January 7, 1785, and received a further land transfer of in 1794. Purgitsville continued to develop throughout the course of the 19th century, during which time it grew to include a small store, a post office, and a blacksmith shop.  Establishment  The dates of the earliest church cannot be verified, but a church building may have been constructed at the site of Old Pine Church as early as around 1814, and possibly as early as 1792. On September 24, 1838, William Pomkrotz and his wife, Milly, deeded a tract of land to a group of trustees, charged with constructing \\"a church or house for public worship for the use and convenience of Ministers and others of the Christians [sic] Denominations Whatsoever\\". While the deed mentioned an existing meeting house on the site, there is no extant evidence of a prior structure. According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi, no particular Christian denomination received sole ownership of the edifice, which suggests that the church was intended to serve as a nondenominational \\"union church\\". The church's earliest resident minister was reportedly Nicholas Leatherman, whose wife, Elizabeth High, was the daughter of George High, one of the church's original trustees.  Brethren affiliation  Few records of the church's history exist, possibly because no single denomination or organization took ownership. Several Christian denominations held meetings at Old Pine Church, including the Schwarzenau Brethren (or German Baptist Brethren), which began holding services at the church in the late 19th century. As many of the Mill Creek valley's settlers were of German descent, the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents, known as \\"Dunkers\\" or \\"Dunkards\\". It is believed that Old Pine Church was also used by German Methodists. The Brethren are a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance. Triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times, once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity. Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament, and professed no other creeds. The interior of Old Pine Church, which consists of a single common space for all worshippers, also illustrates the building's connection with the Brethren and the denomination's beliefs regarding slavery. According to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the Brethren in Franklin County, Virginia, \\"It has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase Negroes or keep them as Slaves.\\" While many residents in Hampshire County prior to the American Civil War were slaveholders, it is thought that Brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor. The Brethren denomination had been present in the South Branch Potomac River valley from as early as the 1750s although records of early Brethren congregations are not extant, possibly because they were served by itinerant ministers. As early as 1785, two brothers with the surname of Powers led a Brethren congregation in the area. In Dr. Emmert F. Bittinger's historical research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his Allegheny Passage (1990), it is noted that the Church of the Brethren denomination recognized Old Pine Church as belonging to the larger Beaver Run congregation, which was centered approximately south of Old Pine Church. The Beaver Run congregation was the first organization of the Brethren in Hampshire County. Old Pine Church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the Beaver Run congregation because the distance between the northern region of the valley and the church on Beaver Run was too great to traverse easily. Thus, Old Pine Church began as a mission of the Beaver Run congregation. Because of its location in the vicinity of the Hardy County boundary line, the district served by the church spanned both counties. By 1870, Old Pine Church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination. Around 1870, the Nicholas congregation of Brethren was worshiping at the church and was led by Dr. Leatherman. According to the Beaver Run Church Book, membership at Old Pine Church was 78 in 1879 and numbered 100 in 1881. The Beaver Run congregation modified its district's boundaries in 1879, which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at Old Pine Church into two factions: White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church. Both churches continued to worship at Old Pine Church at different times. White Pine Church of the Brethren worshiped at the church from the 1870s until the construction of their own church building in 1907. By 1897, Old Pine Church remained under collective ownership by several Christian denominations although the Brethren were the church's largest shareholders. White Pine Church of the Brethren remained listed in the Brethren Conference Minutes as \\"Pine Church\\" until 1912, when members of the church petitioned the Brethren Conference to change their name from \\"Pine\\" to \\"White Pine\\". Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. A small one- room addition to the church was constructed to the north façade of the building, which served as the boarding room for the school's teacher. The Old Pine Church also continued to be used for funeral services and reunions.  Restoration  In 1968, residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church: the church's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced. The boarding room addition was probably removed (nothing of it now remains) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added.  Current use  As of 2012, Old Pine Church is still used for community gatherings, funeral services, revival meetings, and an annual church service. Regular church services have not taken place in the church since the middle of the 20th century. The church's adjacent cemetery also continues to be used for burials. Throughout its existence, Old Pine Church has been known by various names, including \\"Mill Church\\", \\"Nicholas Church\\", and simply \\"Pine Church\\". In 2008, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places following a series of surveys of historic properties throughout the county. The county received funding for the surveying and documentation of Hampshire County architecture and history from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Old Pine Church was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register as a result of the county's initiative. The other seven properties were: Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Springfield Brick House, and Valley View. According to Hampshire County Commission's compliance officer, Charles Baker, places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register; Old Pine Church and Capon Chapel were exceptions because both \\"started out as meeting houses\\". Old Pine Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, because of its \\"significant settlement-era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands\\".  Architecture = Church exterior  alt=Nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden window Old Pine Church is a large, one-story, gablefront log building. Its symmetrical front façade faces west and encompasses a main entrance consisting of a double set of four- paneled doors. The main entrance is reached by two concrete steps, on either side of which is a modern metal handrail. Above the entrance is a small wooden sign painted white reading \\"Old Pine Church\\" in black lettering. On either side of the doors are two nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Placed symmetrically in the north and south sides of the church are two nine- over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Between the two windows on the church's north elevation is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, with the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction. At the base of each of the church's four corners is a large uncut stone pier. Fieldstones span the church's perimeter foundations, which were added at a later date to discourage intrusion by animals. The original hewn log beams, still retaining bark, can be seen under the church. The church is covered with brown-painted wooden German siding and is crowned by a modern standing-seam metal roof. Architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi states that the simple form and construction of Old Pine Church are indicative of the early settlers' access to materials and are an example of the log construction techniques used in the religious architecture of Hampshire County's earliest settlers. She adds that Old Pine Church is representative of a \\"simple design and form common to the early ecclesiastical buildings\\" and an \\"excellent example of one of the area's early rural church complexes\\".  Church interior  Detail of the pressed metal panels of the church's tin ceiling The church's interior exhibits an open architectural plan. A plain wooden frame pulpit stands against the rear wall, underneath the middle window. The church's floor consists of pine boards installed during the church's 1968 restoration. The church's ceiling, measuring approximately in height, is clad in pressed metal panels. A small opening allows for access to the church's attic. The unadorned window wells measure approximately . The interior walls are covered in plasterboard, which remains unfinished. The church's small wood-burning stove originally occupied the center of the sanctuary but was moved to the church's north wall in later years. It continues to serve as the church's sole source of heat. Several of the church's pews date from 1857 and remain in use. The pews, quite simple in form, have a \\"minimalist appearance\\". Each pew consists of a long wooden plank that serves as the seat, with a thin rail supported by three spindles as the backrest. The pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails. The newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber. Though most of the pews are arranged against the church's west elevation with a center aisle, two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation. The pulpit is situated at the east elevation. There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church.  Cemetery  The southwestern area of the cemetery adjoining Old Pine Church. The large oak tree overhanging the cemetery is located to the right. Old Pine Church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments, the oldest section of which is located to the immediate east and south of the church building. The earliest remaining gravestone dates from 1834, but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as 1759. The church's sign along U.S. Route 220 erroneously lists the date of the cemetery's oldest interment sites as 1792. The cemetery's headstones are oriented both to the east and to the west. The majority are simple in design, inscribed with birth and death dates, and consist of a combination of rounded, arched stones, rectangular stones, and pyramidal-shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone. In the cemetery's southern section are several small rectangular stones that probably serve as footstones. Beginning around 1950, the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough-cut stone foundations. Old Pine Church's cemetery is surrounded by several mature trees, with a large oak tree overhanging the southwestern area of the cemetery. Outside of the National Register of Historic Places boundary to the northwest of Old Pine Church lies a second parcel of land acquired around 1950 for additional burials. The cemetery is enclosed by a chicken wire fence supported by wooden posts, with a large gate to the north of the church which allows machinery access into the cemetery.

She played basketball in high school in Georgia, and coached basketball at James Madison University. She was the first executive director of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association and is inducted into several sports halls of fame. Jaynes was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000. Early years and education Born in Covington, Georgia, Jaynes attended Newton County High School and lettered in basketball for four years. Jaynes played as a stationary guard, which dates to the existence of six-on- six basketball. She earned all-state player honors in her junior and senior years. As a senior, she helped her team to a 33–1 record and a place in the Class AA state championship game in 1963. Jaynes earned her Bachelor of Science degree in physical education in 1967 from the Women's College of Georgia, now known as Georgia College & State University, in the school's last graduating class before it became coeducational that fall. She went on to earn a Master of Science in the same field from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1968. College coaching career Jaynes became the head coach of the women's basketball team at Madison College (now James Madison University) in 1970. She continued in that position until 1982, with her teams amassing a record of 142–114. Formation of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association 1981 was a key year in the history of women's basketball. The AIAW had been conducting post-season tournaments for years, but the NCAA decided to offer a women's basketball tournament starting in 1982. While some coaches preferred the AIAW and some preferred the NCAA, there was no organization of coaches to express the position of the coaching community on this or any other issue. While there was an existing organization of basketball coaches, the NABC, it was an association of men's team coaches, and the organization was not prepared to expand their remit to women's team coaches. With no other suitable alternatives, some of the leading coaches met in 1981 to consider forming an association. Later in the year, a formal organizational meeting convened, and Betty Jaynes was selected as the interim executive director. The organization quickly dropped the \\"interim\\" modifier, and Jaynes would go on to serve as Executive Director for 15 years, then \\"retire\\" and continue as a consultant. Death She died at age 68 at a hospice in Athens, Georgia, following a brief illness.

It is located off Carpers Pike (West Virginia Route 259) and crosses the Cacapon River. The bridge formerly carried Capon Springs Road (County Route 16) over the river, connecting Capon Springs and Capon Lake. The bridge's Whipple truss technology was developed by civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by designing the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge and its oldest extant metal truss bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple truss bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) across the South Branch Potomac River near Romney. The larger Whipple truss bridge replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the American Civil War. In 1874, T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple truss bridge over the South Branch; that bridge served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937. Dismantled in 1937, the bridge was relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (County Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge was completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was preserved in place by the West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011.  Geography and setting  alt=A wide stream strewn with rounded stones and surrounded by forests on either side, viewed from a green truss bridge The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is located in a predominantly rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County within the Cacapon River valley. Baker Mountain, a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises to the immediate west, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise to the bridge's east. The confluence of Capon Springs Run with the Cacapon River lies just north (downstream) of the bridge. George Washington National Forest is located to the bridge's southeast, covering the forested area south of Capon Springs Road. The bridge is located along Carpers Pike (West Virginia Route 259) in the unincorporated community of Capon Lake, southwest of Yellow Spring and northeast of the town of Wardensville. The historic Capon Springs Resort and the unincorporated community of Capon Springs are located east of Capon Lake on Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16). The bridge is located immediately north (downstream) of the intersection of Carpers Pike with Capon Springs Road, which is carried across the Cacapon River via the current Capon Lake Bridge, a Girder bridge built in 1991 to replace the Whipple truss bridge for conveying vehicle traffic. The property containing the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is less than in size.  Architecture  alt=An image of the wooden walkway spanning the length of the green Whipple truss bridge The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is an early example of the use of metal truss bridge load-bearing superstructure technology, which defined highway bridge design well into the 20th century. Because of \\"its uncommon innovative design and age\\", the bridge is one of West Virginia's most historically significant bridges. It is the oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge in West Virginia, and the oldest extant metal truss bridge in the state. The metal truss technology of the bridge displays distinctive innovations developed by the prominent civil engineers and bridge designers Squire Whipple and J. W. Murphy; the innovations are evident in the bridge's double-intersection diagonals and counter-diagonals with pin connections. Approximately in width and in length, the bridge is built atop a reinforced concrete abutment and pier. Its truss structure exhibits a double- intersection configuration, constructed of 14 bays, each measuring approximately wide and in height, with the diagonals extending across two bays each. The bridge is fabricated of wrought iron bracketed with pins. Spanning the full length of the bridge is a wooden pedestrian walkway that consists of an observation deck and wooden seating near the bridge's midspan.  History = Whipple truss development  The bridge's Whipple truss technology was developed in 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple was one of the first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin- connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans. alt=A black and white engraved portrait of an elderly man with a long beard and sporting a suit The technological design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, in addition to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At the time of the bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re- erected for use on secondary roads, as was the case with the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.  T. B. White and Sons  The construction company that built the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, T. B. White and Sons, was established in 1868. Its founder Timothy B. White had been a carpenter and contractor in New Brighton, Pennsylvania since the 1840s. White also operated factories for iron cars and woolen mill machinery until 1859, when he began to concentrate solely on bridge construction. White's bridge company operated from a factory on the Beaver River in New Brighton until the factory was destroyed by fire in 1878. After the fire, the company relocated across the river to Beaver Falls and restructured as the Penn Bridge and Machine Works. In addition to iron truss bridges, the company produced a range of structural and architectural components and continued to expand; it employed over 500 workers by 1908. Penn Bridge and Machine Works fended off purchase by the American Bridge Company and continued to operate independently, unlike similar small bridge companies founded in the 19th century. The most prolific of its kind in the Pittsburgh region, the company was responsible for the construction of bridges throughout the United States.  South Branch Bridge  alt=A black and white engraved image of a wooden covered bridge crossing a river with a two-story house in the background The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge (or the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple truss bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) across the South Branch Potomac River west of Romney. The 1874 Whipple truss bridge across the South Branch replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that had been chartered by the Virginia General Assembly during the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike. Before the construction of the covered bridge in 1838, a public ferry conveyed traffic across the river. Isaac Parsons (1752–1796) operated a ferry there following its establishment by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in October 1786. The 1838 covered bridge remained in use until it was destroyed by retreating Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Throughout the course of the war, Romney reportedly changed hands 56 times between Confederate and Union forces, and the crossing of the South Branch Potomac River served as a strategic point due to its position along the Northwestern Turnpike, an important east–west route. Following the conclusion of the war, nearly all bridges along the Northwestern Turnpike had been destroyed, including the South Branch Bridge. In order to restore local businesses and industry, Hampshire County citizens called a meeting and steps were taken at the local level to proceed with the construction of new bridges. Local citizens and the South Branch Intelligencer newspaper of Romney campaigned for the immediate replacement of the bridge because of \\"continual risk, danger and inconveniences arising from want of the South Branch Bridge at Col. Gibson's (destroyed during the war)...\\". Hampshire County began issuing bonds for the construction of a new bridge over the South Branch in 1868, and by 1874, construction of the Whipple truss bridge had commenced. T. B. White and Sons were charged with the bridge's construction. alt=An image of a river in the foreground and a forested mountain ridge in the background, topped with a blue sky and clouds The South Branch Intelligencer published periodic updates on the progress of the South Branch Bridge's construction. According to the newspaper, the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875. During the course of construction, John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge. The new South Branch Bridge was completed well ahead of schedule in October 1874. The October 12, 1874, edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a \\"complete, handsome and durable structure\\", and further recounted that \\"the contractors, Messrs. White & Sons, New Brighton, Pennsylvania 'Penn Bridge & Machine Works,' have given us, in general opinion, a first rate, durable work, and deserve our best commendations.... We are confident that ours will realize a very handsome income and fully vindicate the wisdom of the County Court in voting its construction.\\" Following its construction in 1874, the Whipple truss bridge over the South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with the south side of the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.  Capon Lake Bridge  alt=An image of the green Whipple truss bridge from along the side of a road Because Whipple truss bridges were easily disassembled and re-erected, the remaining western span of the Whipple truss over the South Branch was dismantled in 1937 and relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to convey Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. According to Branson Himelwright, a Capon Springs resident who had been a construction worker involved in the re-erection of the Whipple truss span at Capon Lake, the only two ways to cross the Cacapon River to reach Capon Springs were to cross a swinging footbridge or ford the river. During the bridge's construction, a new pier and abutments were constructed to carry the Whipple truss span and a connected Pratt truss that had been salvaged from an unknown bridge. Himelwright and Jacob \\"Moss\\" Rudolph, who had also participated in the bridge's construction, stated in interviews that both the site excavation and concrete work for the pier and abutments were completed by hand. The newly erected Capon Lake Bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938, with a ceremony including musical performances by the Romney High School and Capon Springs Resort bands. Former West Virginia Governor and Capon Springs native Herman G. Kump, West Virginia State Road Commission Secretary Cy Hammill, and numerous other state officials were in attendance at the dedication. In 1991, the new steel stringer Capon Lake Bridge was constructed to the southwest of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, after which the Whipple truss bridge was closed to vehicle traffic. Due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance, West Virginia Division of Highways District 5 decided to preserve the Whipple truss bridge. During the bridge's restoration, the Pratt truss span was removed due to significant deterioration, and the roadway deck was also removed. A wooden pedestrian walkway and observation deck were constructed across the full span of the remaining truss bridge. alt=A detail of the wooden seat and observation platform at the center of the green Whipple truss bridge facing out over a river The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011, for its \\"engineering significance as an excellent example of a Whipple/Murphy Truss bridge.\\" Since its listing, the bridge has been maintained as a historic site for pedestrians by the West Virginia Division of Highways District 5. In 2012, the West Virginia Division of Highways, in association with the West Virginia Archives and the history department of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History, installed a historical marker at the northwestern entry to the bridge as part of the West Virginia Highway Historical Marker Program.

Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, a 21-year-old, inexperienced French officer, was at first exhilarated, a fighting man at last, and then chastened by a shrapnel wound. Returning to the lines weeks later he was wounded again. After recovering from that he and other French soldiers joined the British in the Dardanelles, from which he was evacuated with amoebic dysentery. Recovered from that he joined a regiment at the Battle of Verdun to be so seriously wounded he was removed from active service. This slender volume (212 p) of short-story/memoirs is his looking back at some of the events, the men he knew, the ideas and emotions that swept through him. http://www.allinoneboat.org/2015/01/26/the-comedy-of-charleroi-courage-and- cowardice-in-ww-i/ Contents * \\"The Comedy of Charleroi\\" (\\"La comédie de Charleroi\\") * \\"A Living Dog Is Better than a Dead Lion\\" (\\"Le chien de l'écriture\\") * \\"Expedition to the Dardanelles\\" (\\"Le voyage des Dardanelles\\") * \\"The Infantry Officer\\" (\\"Le lieutenant de tirailleurs\\") * \\"The Deserter\\" (\\"Le déserteur\\") * \\"End of a War\\" (\\"La fin d'une guerre\\") ReferencesExternal links * The Comedy of Charleroi at the French publisher's website Category:1934 short story collections Category:French-language books Category:French short story collections Category:World War I books Category:World War I fiction Category:Works by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle Category:Éditions Gallimard books Category:Short stories set in Belgium Category:Short stories set in France ","title":"The Comedy of Charleroi"},{"id":"41959209","text":"is a Japanese adult visual novel developed and published by Lump of Sugar.

Hello, Good-bye is romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Kaito Toubu. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue.

There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the four heroines: May Yukishiro, Suguri Saotome, Natsume Rindo and Koharu Hiiragi. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely, which offer an alternative ending to the plot.

On the Grand canal, it is located between Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza and Palazzo Grimani Marcello. It is particularly noteworthy for having been the residence of Austen Henry Layard, discoverer of Niniveh.  Description  Located on the confluence of three canals, it is thus an unusual structure in that it presents three facades rather than the customary one.Marcello Brusegan, I Palazzi di Venezia Newton & Compton, Roma 2007, pag. 51. * Façade on the Grand Canal. It is the widest of the facades, it is characterized by a sober aspect and a large number of lancet windows. The first piano nobile is enriched by a large rectangular three-mullioned window that opens onto a terrace next to Palazzo Grimani Marcello * Façade on the Rio delle Erbe. The least impressive of the facades * Façade on the Rio di San Polo. It is enriched by two balconied three-mullioned windows, with elaborate capitels, flanked by an elegant couple of lancet windows. Nineteenth century stone-carved patera of romansque taste enrich the façade.  Origins and lost fresco cycle by Veronese and Zelotti  Ca' Cappello is a grand palace of Gothic origin, but substantially restructured during the course of the sixteenth century under the direction of its owner, the procurator of Saint Mark Antonio Cappello, who had supervised some of the most important projects of construction and renovation in sixteenth century Venice, in particular the commencement of work on Rialto bridge, the edification of the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana and the supervision of the construction of the Golden staircase at Ducal Palace or the redecoration of the room of the Council of Ten within the palace. For these important works Antonio had frequently commissioned painters Paolo Veronese and Giovanni Battista Zelotti, to who he had ties through common friend Michele Sanmicheli. Veronese and Zelotti were thus commissioned to decorate with frescoes the renovated Renaissance palace.Lotto, A. Aspetti della committenza veneziana in riferimento all'opera di Battista Zelotti doctoral thesis at the Ca Foscari university of Venice (UNIVE), a.y. 2007-2008, p.116-119, accessible online at http://dspace.unive.it/bitstream/handle/10579/1241/Aspetti%20della%20committenza%20veneziana%20-%20con%20foto%20e%20albero.pdf?sequence=2 The fresco cycle was noted by Giorgio Vasari as one of Veronese’s notable works “who painted with the same [Zelotti] the façade of the palace of M. Antonio Cappello that is in Venice overlooking the Grand Canal”. The frescoes were more extensively described by erudite Carlo Ridolfi in his 1648 Le Meraviglie dell’arte, “over the Grand Canal in the house of the Cappelli Veronese coloured some figures of Cerere, Pomona, Pallas and other deities. The figures above were painted by his friend Zelotti”.Ridolfi, C. Le maraviglie dell’arte ovvero le vite de gl’illustri pittori veneti e dello stato, Venezia, 1648 p.308 The cycle did not survive long. In his 1674 Miniere della Pittura Veneziana the erudite Marco Boschini noted surviving but damaged work by Zelotti, and wrote that much had already been lost in a fire.Boschini, M. Le ricche miniere della pittura Veneziana: San Polo, Venezia, 1674, p. 6 The deities painted by Zelotti were however still visible in 1760 when Anton Maria Zanetti printed his Varie Pitture a Fresco de principali maestri Veneziani, and reproduced in engravings the four surviving figures.Zanetti, A.M. Varie pitture a fresco de principali maestri Veneziani: ora per la prima volta con le stampe publicato, Venezia, 1760 It is not certain when these remaining and worn out frescoes were finally lost, but by the nineteenth century they were certainly no longer visible.  Ca Cappello and the salon of the Layards  Portrait of Mehmet II by Gentile Bellini, c. 1481, 69.9x52.1 cm, National Gallery, London, originally in the Layard Gallery in Ca Cappello Ca Cappello was purchased, at a date given variously as 1874 and 1878 by sources, by the English archeologist, diplomat and politician Austen Henry Layard, with the help of the doyen of the British community in Venice, the historian Rawdon Brown.Hutton, L. Literary Landmarks of Venice, New York, 1896, pp.39-40 Layard, who had shipped his great collection of Italian Renaissance paintings to Venice in 1875, inhabited the palazzo stably following his withdrawal from the diplomatic career after political debacle in Istanbul and deep disagreement with Gladstone until his death by cancer, on the occasion of a rare visit to London, in 1894.Mamoli-Zorzi, R. Enid e Henry Austen Layard: collezionismo e mondanità a Palazzo Cappello in Bisutti, F. & Celotti, M. Personaggi stravaganti a Venezia tra '800 e '900: Le storie del FAI/1, Venezia, 2010, pp. 75-96 The frescoes by Zelotti and Veronese were no longer visible, but Layard managed significant renovation works in the palace. Red, yellow and green felt covered the walls inside, and Spanish silks festooned outside of balconies and windows gave the palazzo an unmistakable appearance. Assyrian reliefs from Niniveh and a Hellenistic funary piece from Samos were installed into the staircase wall, though these were in 1892 donated to the Museo Civico Correr, and replaced with floral paintings by Neapolitan artist Francesco Lavagna. More significant was the collection of paintings assembled by the Layards in a gallery in the palazzo, with the most significant work being the Portrait of Mehmet II by Gentile Bellini. Because of Layard’s particular standing, the palazzo quickly became a meeting place for “the greatest representatives of British and international cultural, political and diplomatic intelligentsia between the final quarter of the XIXth century and the first decade of the XXth”.Righetti, A. Layard tra gli intellettuali inglesi e americani in Italia in Fales, F.M. & Hickey, B.J. Austen Henry Layard tra l’oriente e Venezia, Roma, 1983, p.104 The Layards quickly rose amongst a thriving expat community in Venice, their patronage ensuring the edification of St. George’s Anglican church in Venice, where glass windows commemorate the founder.Pemble, J. The resident strangers of nineteenth century Venice: myth and reality in Griffiths, R.A. & Law, J.E. Rawdon Brown and the anglo-Venetian relationship, Stroud, 2005, pp.50-53 The death of Austen Henry Layard did not interrupt social activity, and his widow, Lady Enid, maintained an equally intense social activity in the palazzo. The intense social activity around the salon of Austen Henry Layard and his wife Enid is recorded in Lady Layard’s diary. Frequent visitors included art historians John Ruskin and Giovanni Morelli, the Victorian poet Robert Browning, of whose poetic abilities Lady Layard had a low opinion, and the historian Horatio Brown, as well as local nobles such as countess Annina Morosini, supposedly the most beautiful woman in Venice at the time, but whom Lady Layard found “vulgar”. Royalty acknowledged the Layards, and Lady Enid in particular enjoyed a special relationship with queen Alexandra and the German empress consort Victoria. Writing about Lady Layard in 1898 her friend Lady Gregory remembered that “the emperor [the Kaiser, son of empress Victoria] passed this house [Ca Cappello] recognized Lady Layard on the balcony and touched his hat two or three times”. In 1911 the Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Lord Kitchener even held private meetings in Ca Cappello.  Later History and controversial swap  The death of Lady Layard in 1912 and the outbreak of the war saw an end to Ca Cappello’s role as a leading literary and social salon in Venice. It was later acquired by the Carnelutti family, before passing in 1967 into the possession of the University of Venice Ca’ Foscari. It is currently the object of a controversial swap operation that would see it transferred, together with sixteenth-century palace Ca Bembo and the modern Palazzo Cosulich, two other university properties, to a property investment fund in exchange for a 1957 former state electricity company edifice. The swap has aroused considerable criticism and investigative weekly L'Espresso has noted the absence of a public auction and problems connected with an apparent violation - only supposed - with Italian heritage law, that forbids the swap of listed property.http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2014/01/27/news/ca- foscari-la-svendita-delle-sedi-fa-paura-1.149961 The chancellor Carlo Carraro has defended the operation on budget grounds, arguing it will help stave off large cuts to scholarships and research funding.\\"Tagli ai servizi se non vendiamo i palazzi\\" Gazzettino di Venezia, 3 Dicembre 2013  References  Cappello Layard ","title":"Palazzo Cappello Layard"},{"id":"41959215","text":"Thomas Dawson, 1st Viscount Cremorne was an Irish landowner and politician from County Monaghan.

She was the daughter of Baron Gustaf Adolph Clodt and Brita Stuart and married Baron Åke Rålamb in 1689. She served as lady-in-waiting to Queen Hedvig Eleonora in 1668–1680, Queen Ulrika Eleonora in 1680–1693 and to Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden in 1693–1708. She became a personal friend of the queen and are counted as belonging to the circle of intimate friends to the queen along with the royal chaplain confessor Johan Carlberg, Maria Elisabeth Stenbock and Sophia Amalia Marschalk. She used her position as a courtier by creating a net of influential contacts, which she could use to forward requests and make recommendations from supplicants to power holders at court in exchange for money. This was a common way for a female courtier to earn money, but Clodt was very successful in her line of business, especially since she was somewhat of a favorite of Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Already in 1673, she stated in a letter that she was consulted so often by clients that she had grown weary of it.

It follows Page Eight, which aired on BBC Two in August 2011 and is followed by Salting the Battlefield. Plot Following the events of Page Eight, ex-MI5 officer Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is in hiding on the Turks and Caicos Islands. A seemingly chance encounter with Curtis Pelissier (Christopher Walken) leads Johnny to a dinner with several shady American businessmen who comprise a company called Gladstone. The following morning, one of the businessmen is found dead on the beach in suspicious circumstances; Melanie Fall (Winona Ryder), a Gladstone liaison, seems to know more than she lets on. When Pelissier reveals himself to be a CIA covert operative who knows Johnny's true identity, Johnny desperately cuts a deal: he will help Pelissier with the investigation of Gladstone in exchange for his silence about his location. The remaining businessmen claim to be on the islands for an international financial colloquium. Johnny learns they have a link to London private equity mogul Stirling Rogers (Rupert Graves), who is also director of a charitable foundation called The Bridge. Johnny links The Bridge to his old nemesis, Prime Minister Alec Beasley (Ralph Fiennes). Johnny's old girlfriend, former MI5 analyst Margot Tyrell (Helena Bonham-Carter), is now a financial expert in London who is working with Rogers. He calls on old acquaintance Rollo Maverley (Ewen Bremner) to contact Margot and extract information regarding The Bridge. Before long, Johnny learns the extent of Gladstone's activities: they are \\"quartermasters\\" who have been overcharging the U.S. government for the construction of black site torture camps. When Margot and Rogers arrive on the island, Johnny quickly makes his presence known and, along with Pelissier, sets up a high-stakes meeting with the concerned parties. Amid tense negotiations, Johnny — with the help of Margot's information — secures a deal between the CIA and Gladstone, and reveals a link between the company's excess funds and Beasley's future ambitions. However, Johnny is double-crossed by Pelissier and is forced to flee the islands. He and Margot reconcile, and — with the help of local policeman Carroll — evade the CIA long enough to escape via boat. The two now go on the run, knowing their lives will never be the same again.

She used the net of contacts her office gave her to benefit the interests of both her family, herself personally as well as individual supplicants and foreign powers in exchange for money. She is known for her successful use of her service as lady-in- waiting for lucrative purposes, and considered a notable example of a female courtier who used her office and the net of contact it gave her as a way of creating influence and personal wealth. Biography Beata Sparre was the daughter of Baron Axel Carlsson Sparre and Beata Stenbock. She served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Hedvig Eleonora in 1680-1715 and to Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden in 1715-1720\\\\. She used her position as a courtier by creating a net of influential contacts, which she could use to accept and put forward requests from supplicants in exchange for money. This was a common way for a female courtier to earn money, but like her contemporary Anna Maria Clodt, Sparre was very successful in her line of business. Already during the 1680s, she had created a power base through which she could exact favors from the monarch. The French embassy pointed her out as one of the power holders in the Swedish court necessary to cultivate. She is known to have received gifts from France and may have acted as a French agent, which would make her a spy: it was noted that during the fire of the royal palace in 1697, she saved a portrait of Louis XIV of France which she had been given as a personal gift from France. Her petitions to Charles XII of Sweden went through the channel of the royal princesses and were normally successful. In 1709, she was a part of the group consisting of herself, Arvid Horn, the queen dowager's priest Molin, Christina Piper, and Märta Berendes who evicted Anna Catharina von Bärfelt from court by forming an alliance with Carl Gyllenstierna. In 1703, she had Princess Ulrika Eleonora acquire a mansion for her by Charles XII. When she finally lost favor at court, she retired to this manor. References * Eva Österberg, red (1997).

It is the one of the largest villages by area, the tenth most popular village (with over 3,779 people) in the Najafgarh Tehsil of South-West Delhi. It is bounded by the Daulatpur, Hasan Pur villages on the south, the Ujawa on the southwest, and the Pandwala Khurd on the southeast. It shares land borders with Shri Hans Nagar and Khera Dabar to the west; Paprawat to the northeast; and Pandwala Khurd to the east. Etymology The name Pandwala Kalan is derived from Paṇḍ (पण्ड्), which means \\"to collect, heap, pile up\\", and this root is used in the sense of knowledge.[5] The term is found in Vedic and post-Vedic texts, but without any sociological context. In the colonial era literature, the term generally refers to Brahmins specialized in Hindu law.[6] Aala (आला), which means the supreme leader of the organization. The latter term stems from the Kalan (Hindustani: कलाँ, Punjabi: ਕਲਾਂ) are administrative designations used in India and Pakistan to indicate the smaller (Khurd) and larger (Kalan) segments of a town, village or settlement. The geographical term Pandwala Kalan, which is recognized by the Constitution of India as an official name for the village is used by many in its variations. Scholars believe it to be named after the Vedic tribe in the second millennium B.C.E. It is also traditionally associated with the Droņa (Sanskrit: द्रोण, Droņa) or Droņacharya or Guru Droņa, the royal preceptor to the Kauravas and Pandavas and incarnation of Brahma; an avatar of Brihaspati. He was the son of rishi Bharadwaja and a descendant of the sage Angirasa. He was a master of advanced military arts, including the divine weapons or Astras. History Pandwala has an ancient history since Mahabharata era when Drona decides to continue Parashurama's legacy by starting his own school. He uproots his family and begins wandering Northern India. While at Hastinapur, he comes across the Kuru princes at play, and is able to use his abilities to help the princes solve some of their problems. Amazed, the princes go to their patriarch Bhisma with news of this magician. Bhishma instantly realized that this was Drona, and asked him to become the Guru of the Kuru princes, training them in advanced military arts.[6] It is believed that the city of Gurgaon (literally - \\"Village of the Guru\\") was founded as \\"Guru Gram\\" by Dronacharya on land given to him by Dhritarashtra, the king of Hastinapura in recognition of his teachings of martial arts to the princes, and the 'Dronacharya Tank', still exists within the Gurgaon city, along with a village called Gurgaon.[14] Pandwala is one of the places in Gurgaon where Dharma was taught to the Kauravas and Pandavas. The village is about 15 km away from Indira Gandhi International Airport, and 2 km away from Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan, which is Asia's largest Ayurvedic hospital. It is declared as R-Zone officially by Delhi government. It has a green environment with a few temples with great history. The main and famous temple of the village is Ramtal mandir and it is the only village in Najafgarh district in which the tubewell water can be used for drinking purpose while in all other villages of Najafgarh groundwater is not suitable for drinking. Nowadays the agricultural land is being sold. In coming years we may see a different village which would be occupied by the higher buildings. Far in the land pooling policy is 400% acc. To which the buildings will be up to 38 to 40 floors. Currently, rates are 5 crore per acre in 2014 before the land pooling policy. After passing of a land pooling policy there could be a step increase in the price of the properties. The village has its own post office, Meetha kuan is oldest well in this village. There are two temples in the village: Hanuman temple and Shiva temple. Hanuman temple is the oldest one. The village is among the very fast developing villages. Pandwala Kalan has its own primary school, a dispensary with good facilities, and Sr. Sec. School Chatarpati Shivaji. The village is full of peace and the village has its own park which is developed by the efforts of its own people without any help from government. Sushil International School managed by famous wrestler Sushil Kumar foundation is situated next to Shri Hans Nagar Colony on main Najafgarh–Darulla road on land of Pandwala Kalan. The main and influential peoples of the villages Mela is organised in the Ramtal mandir every year on the last two days of navratris and a bhandara on 30 January of every year. There are two gotras of Yadav's in this village. They are Aafariyas and Gothwals. Also, there are pandits in the village.

The series follows twins, Dipper (voiced by Jason Ritter) and Mabel (voiced by Kristen Schaal), as they spend their summer vacation at their great uncle's tourist trap, where they are introduced to the paranormal side of the town Gravity Falls. The episode is the second of the two-part finale of the first season.

The episode received a viewership of 3.2 million. \\"Gideon Rises\\" was released for digital distribution as part of the series Volume 2.iTunes - Gravity Falls, Vol. 2  Plot summary  Gideon Gleeful has taken control of the Mystery Shack, forcing the Pines family to move in with Soos at his grandmother's house. At a press conference, Gideon announces his intentions to turn the Mystery Shack into his own personal theme park, Gideonland, which the Pines family see on television. After failing to convince the town of Gideon's true nature, Mabel worries about where are they going to stay if they don't get the Mystery Shack back. Meanwhile, at the Mystery Shack, Gideon reveals to his father the true nature of his book; the story reads that it was written a long time ago by a brilliant unknown author who learned the secrets of Gravity Falls, secrets too powerful for one man, and hid the journals where no one could find them, knowing that when the journals are brought together, it would lead to a gateway of \\"unimaginable power\\". However, he is unaware that there are three journals and not two. Gideon says that codes and maps from the journal have led him to believe that the other book is hidden somewhere on the Mystery Shack's property. Meanwhile, Dipper and Mabel are told that they are heading on the next bus out of Gravity Falls. With advice from their own journal, 3, they soon come up with a plan: assembling the gnomes that had tried to kidnap Mabel at the beginning of the summer to try to take back the shack, but the gnomes are stopped by Gideon's pig whistle. As the gnomes grab a hold of both Dipper and Mabel, Dipper drops the third journal, and Gideon takes it from him. Dipper and Mabel then leave the town on the bus. Back at the Mystery Shack, Gideon is overjoyed to have the journal he stole from Dipper, until discovering it is the journal number 3. Believing that Dipper is trying to get the first out of town, Gideon takes a giant robot look-alike and goes after their bus. Upon watching the Gideon- bot, Dipper and Mabel tell the bus driver, Soos, to run. Gideon chases and corners the bus at the edge of a cliff. Dipper and Mabel escape the bus, but Gideon corners them. Gideon grabs Mabel and throws Dipper aside, planning to rule Gravity Falls with Mabel as his queen. Dipper jumps off the cliff into the Gideon-bot, where he and Gideon start to fight, with Dipper beating Gideon. However, the bot loses balance and falls off the bridge, but Mabel and Dipper are saved by Mabel's grappling hook. A large crowd surrounds the robot, to which Gideon lies that Dipper and Mabel tried to kill him. As the police get ready to arrest Dipper and Mabel, Stan shows up and reveals that Gideon is a fraud; he uses hidden video cameras inside the pins he gives out to spy on the local citizens. The police arrest Gideon, and Stan takes the deed and 2 from him. The Pines return to the Mystery Shack and start settling their things back in their room, when Stan goes to check on them. Dipper and Mabel tell Stan that they were talking, and they wanted to show Stan the journal, exclaiming that they finally trust him. Stan laughs, crediting everything the twins told him to be a result of reading the book, and takes it. Later that night, Stan takes 3 and later opens a hidden passage door behind the Mystery Shack vending machine. He walks into a hidden laboratory and goes down an elevator. Revealing that he was the one with ownership of 1, he places the three books together with each opened at a specific page revealing the blueprint for a machine. He uses codes from the pages to activate the machine. As the episode closes, he merely says \\"Here we go!\\".  Reception  \\"Gideon Rises\\" was released on August 2, 2013, as the last episode of the Gravity Falls first season and received a viewership of 3.2 million in the United States. The episode was nominated for a Golden Reel Award under the category Best Sound Editing - Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue and ADR Animation in Television. The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of \\"A\\", concluding \\"No single half-hour could wrap up all the questions Gravity Falls has raised over this season, but this episode shows an impressive knack for knowing which questions need answering and which can be safely ignored. And the biggest question it answers isn’t even really on the radar until the final minutes of the episode, as Stan finally reveals just how much he's been fooling everyone all this time. Alex Hirsch nails Stan's reaction to being presented with Dipper's journal, as he can’t quite mask his initial, genuine excitement before returning to his oblivious disguise.

Born in Queensland and becoming a professional runner in 1902, Postle rose to prominence for the defeat of Beauchamp Day – then an Irish world champion – at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia in December 1906. Known thereafter as 'The Crimson Flash' for his coloured running costume, Postle also acquired the moniker \\"The Mighty Postle\\" for his defeat of Bill Growcott two years later in England, Growcott being England's champion runner. Postle's career took him throughout the United Kingdom and to New Zealand as well as across Australia, where he had a rivalry with fellow Australian champion Jack Donaldson. Postle set world records for fifty, sixty, seventy-five, eighty and two-hundred yard sprints during his career, which ended in 1913 a year after his marriage to an Englishwoman. He ventured into business, and then became a farmer until full- retirement during the Second World War. He had four children who all survived him upon his death in Brisbane. Edward Seldon Sears wrote that Postle, together with Donaldson, had \\"few peers among sprinters of their day\\"Sears (2008) p. 170. and since his retirement he has been consider one of \\"the greatest of all Australian runners\\". Career=Early life Postle was born in Springside near Pittsworth, in the Darling Downs of the Australian state of Queensland. Part of a large family, Postle was the second-oldest of nine children for Arthur Benjamin Postle Snr. and Frances Postle, née Honor. Postle's father was born in Melbourne, while his mother was English. Postle was schooled at Springside State School, starting there in 1888. He showed much promise as a runner from early on in his career, and after leaving education in 1893 to work on his father's farm he continued to compete in local athletics tournaments. For one, he needed to catch an early morning train, which he missed. He nevertheless decided to walk the distance to the track, which took him all day. His father disapproved of Postle's running aspirations; the family farm struggled constantly against drought. Postle was coached instead by his uncle who owned a farm next door on which he had cut a running track. After years work on his father's farm, Postle left to pursue his athletic career in 1899, while his brothers all remained to continue farming. Professional career Postle's early, unsuccessful, attempts in the Stawell Gift in 1901 and 1903 garnered for him some local notoriety, and he became a professional runner in 1902. His training focused largely on his technique at the start of his run. He used an unusual starting technique, with his left side prominent and his fingers spread wide. He \\"emphasised rhythmical breathing during springing, followed his sessions with cold showers, employed an experienced masseur who used oil... and took iron tonic occasionally and castor oil\\". Postle adhered to a strict diet – foods with high fat contents including milk, eggs and steak – largely based on experience rather than scientific research, which was minimal at the time. He was victorious in games held at Charters Towers and Townsville in the winter of 1904–05, becoming \\"unbeatable up to eighty yards\\". In April 1905 he won one-hundred and thirty and four-hundred and forty yard sprints at Bendigo, and in June he was victorious in a one-hundred yard run in Sydney. He returned to Townsville in September to come second in a seventy-five-yard sprint; he went back to Charters Towers in October and won prize money for his racing – equivalent to 130 Pound Sterling; he won £75 more in January, and twice again in February 1906, across several races. His later defeat of South African Reggie Walker brought him a diamond-encrusted necklace. In 1906, in front of a 20,000-strong crowd at Kalgoorlie gold mine, Postle defeated Beauchamp Day, a champion Irish runner sponsored by promoter Rufus Naylor, in a seventy-five-yard spring. Postle's 7.20-second time was a new world record, and his achievements attracted athlete Jack Todd who became Postle's coach. He returned to the event a year later in 1907 and, being beaten in the semi-final unexpectedly by J. Condon, immediately proceeded to jump the perimeter fence and run to a local bookmakers to place money on Condon winning the final, an event which passed into folklore and is remembered often in Australian sprinting. In 1908 at Durban Postle ran fifty yards in 5.20 seconds, another record, and later the same year he set yet another world record, running sixty yards in 6.1 seconds. His defeat of Bill Growcott in England, and his trademark crimson running gear, earned him the nicknames 'The Mighty Postle' and 'The Crimson Flash'. The Albany Advertiser recalled in 1937 that \\"he was always smartly attired in bright red silk singlet and knickers\\" which led to the latter moniker. He also opted to use a number of emblems to represent his nationality, in an era before standardised colours and emblems were used by Australian sportsmen. In addition to his crimson vest he wore green shorts with gold trim, and his shirt had an emu and a kangaroo, one on each breast.Headon (2001) p. 23. As Postle's notoriety grew, a rivalry began between Jack Donaldson – a prolific Australian sprinter nicknamed 'Blue Streak' – and himself. Postle and American runner Charles Holway challenged Donaldson to a race at Johannesburg in February 1910 to decide who would be crowned World Champion over a one-hundred yard sprint. Though Postle began quickest, he was overtaken by Donaldson at eighty yards and the latter was victorious by 2.4 yards. Postle and Donaldson continued their rivalry, with the former dominating shorter sprints and the latter commanding the one- hundred yard runs – aside from on one occasion in 1912 when Postle defeated his rival in runs of seventy-five, one-hundred and fifty and two-hundred yard springs, setting new world records for the latter. Their record head-to-head would eventually lie at 15:6 in favour of Donaldson. Postle would also rival with Holway himself, and challenged him to several head-to-head races during his career. In October 1912, Postle married an Englishwoman, Edna Leadbeater, in Lancashire, England. Leadbeater was the sister-in-law of Postle's old coach, Todd. The couple would go on to have four children. Later life After retiring from running in 1913, Postle owned an auctioneering business in Memerambi, ran a running-shoe shop, and then traded second-hand goods in Gympie. He failed as a trader in the markets of South Brisbane and became a farmer in Coopers Plains. Through the 1930s he published his autobiography, The Crimson Flash, in weekly instalments in The Sporting Globe, a Melbourne newspaper. The pieces would go on to be collated into a published autobiography edited by Gary Parker in 1995. His mother died in 1937, and his father twelve months later. During the Second World War he sold the farm and retired to Wynnum, though he continued to coach runners well into the 1950s. He was still a regular at local running tracks, sharing his expertise with young runners. He coached Norma Croker, later an Olympic gold medal winner. He fell ill on 21 April 1965 and died in an ambulance. Streets in Brisbane and Canberra were named after him, as is a seventy-meter sprint run every year at Stawell Gift in his honour. He was inducted into the Sports Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

Early years Marc Ferrez was born on 14 October 1788 in Saint-Laurent, in the arrondissement of Saint-Claude, Jura, France. He was the eldest of three brothers born in that town. Auguste Ferrez was born in 1795 and Zéphirin Ferrez in 1797. Their parents were a carpenter and a seamstress. In 1809 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he studied under the sculptor Philippe-Laurent Roland (1746–1816) and the engraver Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet (1750–1818). His brother Zepherin Ferrez (1797–1851) was also a sculptor and engraver, and also studied at the École des Beaux-Arts. The two brothers spent six months in New York City in 1816–17. Brazil In 1817 the Ferrez brothers moved to Rio de Janeiro where they joined the Missão Artística Francesa (French Artistic Mission) organized by Joachim Lebreton. Lebreton had brought a group of artists to Brazil, arriving on 25 March 1816. These included the painter Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768–1848), the sculptor Auguste Marie Taunay (1768–1824) and his brother the painter Nicolas Antoine Taunay (1755–1830), the engraver Charles-Simon Pradier (1786–1847)) and the architect Auguste- Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny (1776–1850). They were to form the nucleus of a royal art academy in Brazil. Bust of Pedro I of Brazil, by an unknown sculptor after the original by Marc Ferrez The Ferrez brothers worked with Auguste Marie Taunay, Debret and the architect Grandjean de Montigny on the decorations for the monuments erected on the occasion of the arrival of Princess Maria Leopoldina of Austria (1797–1826) and her marriage with the Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (1798–1834). In 1820 Marc Ferrez was appointed a permanent lecturer at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. After Auguste–Marie Taunay died in 1824, Marc Ferrez became deputy professor of sculpture. When Joaquim Alão died in 1837 he became full professor. In 1842 Marc Ferrez made the sculptural decorations of the rooms of Dona Teresa Cristina on the frigate Constitution, which brought her to Brazil. Marc Ferrez died in Rio de Janeiro on 1 April 1850, aged 61. Francisco Manuel Chaves Pinheiro (1822–1884) was one of his best-known pupils. His nephew, Zepherin's son, also called Marc Ferrez, became a celebrated photographer. Work Marc Ferrez made copies of antiques, monumental decorations and classical busts. His copies of statues and plaster bas reliefs were not exceptional but were skilfully executed. Typically they were made from classical Greek models. Most of his monumental work in terracotta has been destroyed, broken while being moved from one place to another. He is now best known for his highly realistic and technically excellent busts. Due to the absence of marble and high price of bronze, he was forced to make almost all his portraits in plaster, which he painted to give the illusion of metal. The only known bronze bust is one of Pedro I (1826). Some of his works included: *A sculpted wood cradle created with his brother, offered to the Emperor Pedro I when the princess Maria da Glória was born in 1818. *Statues of Apollo and Minerva for the facade of the Academy *Bust of Pedro I of Brazil (1826) *Bust of a Lady of the First Reign (1829) *Bust of Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada (1829) *Bust of José Bonifácio de Andrada (1839) ReferencesSources   * * Category:1788 births Category:1850 deaths Category:19th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors ","title":"Marc Ferrez (sculptor)"},{"id":"41959591","text":"Harold Hawkins (22 July 1886 - 16 June 1917) was a British sports shooter.

He became the executive director of the California-based Alliance for Children's Rights in 1997. Bridge spent 12 years in the foster care system as a child in Los Angeles County, and achieved a scholarship to Wesleyan University, became a Fulbright Scholar, Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Resident, Stueben Schultz Gesellschaft Scholar, Lyndon B. Johnson Scholar, and graduate from Harvard Law School. While in foster care as a child, Bridge was confined to the MacLaren Children's Center in Los Angeles County, a facility criticized for its harsh treatment of children and ultimately closed pursuant to a judicial settlement in Katie A. v. Los Angeles County. As an adult, Bridge represented children at the facility. Under Bridge's leadership, the Alliance led the establishment of National Adoption Day in the United States. Bridge led both a successful constitutional challenge to local judicial practices that forbid foster youth and their families from speaking publicly about their experiences and treatment by foster care officials, as well as a successful challenge to halt prevailing child welfare practices that allowed foster care officials to place children in foster homes, group homes, and other residential settings without later visiting foster children to ensure their ongoing well-being and safety. Later Bridge joined the Broad Foundation, which under his tenure established the framework for Los Angeles County's $3.4 billion federal foster care financial waiver, allowing federal funding to support children in their own families rather than requiring children to be removed from their families and taken into state care in order to receive assistance. He is noted for his defense of families whose children are involved in state systems of care and criticism of the use of congregate care facilities in child welfare systems. Bridge began his legal career at the Democratic law firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP practicing in the corporate mergers and acquisitions department of the firm. He left Manatt, Phelps joining the Judge David L. Bazelon Center in Washington, D.C., to litigate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of children in Alabama's public psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities under federal class actions in Wyatt v. Poundstone and R.C. v. Hornsby. Following the Alliance for Children's Rights and his work at the Broad Foundation, Bridge went on to serve as Senior Innovation Adviser to the State of Illinois and its child welfare system. His childhood memoir Hope's Boy was named a New York Times Bestseller, Publishers Weekly Bestseller, Los Angeles Times Discoveries Book, People Magazine Critic's Choice, and Washington Post Book of the Year. He has contributed to The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and other publications. In addition, Bridge chaired the 1999-2000 Los Angeles County Blue Ribbon Task Force on the safety of children in the nation's largest child welfare system, which recommended a fundamental overhaul of the treatment, placement, and care of children. He has served as a University of California Regents' Lecturer. In 2015, he was appointed Commissioner to the Los Angeles County Probation Commission. He is a founding Director of The New Village Charter School for Girls, a charter school for pregnant and parenting teens and California's first charter school solely for girls.

Her parents owned estates on the island of Trinidad and eastern Venezuela, including one on the islet of Chacachacare and another in Delta Amacuro.

After the capitulation of the First Republic in mid-1812, Mariño's ranch in Chacachacare became the meeting place for Republicans. Mariño played a key role, taking charge of weapons smuggling from Trinidad to the mainland to be used by the troops of Simon Bolivar, though this caused a lawsuit under the authority of British martial law. The campaign to liberate eastern Venezuela began on January 2, 1813, on the Chacachacare estate. It included the drafting and signing of the Acta Chacachacare by Santiago Mariño, Francisco Azcue, Jose Francisco Bermudez, Manuel Piar and Manuel Valdes, which mentions Mariño as a \\"magnanimous woman\\", and started the Campaña de Oriente.

Before representing his hometown of Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and neighboring communities in the Greater- Springfield area, he worked as a White House aide during the Obama administration. Lesser is one of the originators of the White House Passover Seder.  Early life and education  Lesser grew up in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and graduated from Longmeadow High School. Known as an advocate for public schools, Lesser worked with students, parents, and teachers to increase school funding. He also worked for Congressman Richard Neal and Senator Ted Kennedy. Lesser was an active member of Sinai Temple, coordinating volunteer activities for high school students, and an active volunteer with the Longmeadow Democratic Town Committee. Lesser's father, Martin, is a family doctor in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and a member of the Massachusetts National Guard. In 2010, he served a tour of duty in Iraq. Lesser's mother, Joan, is a social worker in Holyoke. After high school, Lesser received his bachelor's degree in government from Harvard College. While in college, Lesser worked on Deval Patrick's gubernatorial campaign. He led the Harvard College Democrats and a policy group on Congressional Redistricting Reform. At Harvard University's Institute of Politics, he started a public policy research program. While a student at Harvard Law School, Lesser was named one of the \\"most impressive Harvard Law students\\" by Business Insider. He is also a member of the Massachusetts Bar.  Career = Obama presidential campaign  After college, Lesser joined Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, helping stage events in New Hampshire. After the primary, Lesser was tapped to be the campaign's \\"Ground Logistics Coordinator,\\" traveling with the candidate to 47 states and six countries – over 200,000 miles in total. Commenting on his logistical prowess, President Obama said \\"Eric Lesser may be running a Fortune 500 company one day,\\" adding \\"We are lucky to have such a smart and committed young man as part of our team.\\" During a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Lesser organized an impromptu Passover Seder. At the Passover Seder, then-Senator Obama promised, \\"Next year in the White House.\\"  White House aide  After the campaign, David Axelrod tapped Lesser to serve as his Special Assistant, where he shared a wall with the Oval Office. Lesser was described as a \\"wunderkind\\" and a \\"West Wing mascot\\" during his time at the White House. Lesser also worked as the Director of Strategic Planning at the Council of Economic Advisers, the White House unit charged with offering the President objective economic advice.  White House Seder  250px Lesser was a chief organizer of an annual White House Passover Seder attended by President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and their daughters – the first presidential Seder in American history. The Seder is a reunion of the original group who met in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the 2008 campaign. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad- Lubavitch center in Springfield, MA. Over the years the Seder has grown in prominence. President Obama has discussed the Seder with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Sara Netanyahu gave the President a silver Seder plate to use in subsequent White House Seders. President Obama has spoken of the Seder in a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and in an address before the Israeli people.  Massachusetts Senate = Elections  On February 3, 2014, The Republican newspaper reported that Lesser was considering a bid for the First Hampden & Hampshire seat in the Massachusetts State Senate that was recently vacated by Sen. Gale Candaras. On February 18, 2014, Lesser announced his candidacy for Massachusetts State Senate. On September 9, Lesser won a competitive Democratic primary in the race for state senate. On November 4, Lesser defeated Republican Debra Boronski and America First candidate Mike Franco to win the State Senate seat. Lesser launched his reelection bid in September 2016 after an uncontested Democratic primary. On November 8, 2016, Lesser defeated James \\"Chip\\" Harrington, earning 56 percent of the vote to Harrington's 44 percent. During the campaign, Lesser attracted a series of high-profile endorsements, including President Barack Obama; both U.S. Senators from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey; U.S. Representatives Richard Neal, Joe Kennedy III, and Seth Moulton; former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis; and Springfield, Massachusetts mayor Domenic Sarno. Lesser was sworn in for a second term in the Massachusetts State Senate on January 4, 2017. Lesser won his third election to the Massachusetts State Senate in 2018, running uncontested in the Democratic primary and general election.  Political Positions  High-speed rail = Sen. Eric Lesser speaks at the Rally for Rail at Union Station in Springfield, MA. Lesser is a leading advocate of a high-speed rail system to ease travel between eastern and western Massachusetts. He believes that a high-speed rail line between Springfield and Boston would lead to an increase in employment and an overall boost to the economy in Western Massachusetts. In his first month in office, Lesser filed a bill that would require a report of the costs and benefits of a high which the State Senate passed unanimously, 39–0, and the State House of Representatives later passed. Governor Charlie Baker vetoed the legislation; it was later revealed that Peter Picknelly, the chief executive of Peter Pan Bus Lines, had personally lobbied the governor, sending Baker an email urging him to reject the proposal. Picknelly donated $1,000 to Baker's election campaign and hosted a campaign fundraiser for him. In 2018, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced their intention to study Lesser's east–west high-speed rail proposal; Lesser called this step a \\"major breakthrough.\\" Lesser's proposed high-speed rail connection has gained the widespread support, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, nearly all western Massachusetts lawmakers, the Boston City Council, and business leaders like the Greater Springfield and Greater Boston Chambers of Commerce. = Plan to end opioid misuse = After the heroin epidemic resulted in 185 deaths in the first four months of 2014, Lesser created and published a four-point plan with concrete steps to address addiction. His plan includes the addition of more drug courts specializing in sending drug users to treatment instead of jail in Western Massachusetts, work to end dependence on prescription drugs through partnerships with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other organizations, investment in new treatments that have shown promise in decreasing withdrawal symptoms, and an increase in the availability of the drug Narcan, which can save lives by reversing the effects of a heroin overdose. In January 2015, Lesser filed two bills regarding opioid misuse. Lesser's bills served as the blueprint for the plan ultimately adopted by the Massachusetts State Senate in its 2015 budget, which allocated $100,000 in state funds to buy doses of the drug Naloxone, commonly known as Narcan, which can reverse opiate overdoses. Later in 2015, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced a settlement with Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the manufacturer of naloxone, in which Amphastar paid $325,000 into the state's bulk purchasing program. The state's fund spent $377,000 to buy 11,050 doses of naloxone and 8,750 applicators; as of November 30, 2016, 8,500 doses have been distributed to cities and towns in Massachusetts, saving local communities an estimated $186,000. In January 2017, Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel told the Public Health Council that 50,000 people in Massachusetts were now trained to administer Narcan, and more than \\"1,500 overdose rescue reports — each a life saved — were received in the first six months of 2016.\\" = Education = Sen. Eric Lesser quizzes students on state government. Lesser is a leading advocate for civics education in Massachusetts. In 2018, a bill was signed into law cementing civics education in public school curricula, requiring student-led civics projects, and — as Lesser championed in a previous bill — highlighting media literacy. Lesser also supports increased investment in vocational training. Lesser, calling America's $1.5 trillion in student loan debt a \\"generational crisis,\\" has proposed a Student Loan Bill of Rights to increase oversight of student loan servicers and protect borrowers. = Economy of western Massachusetts = In addition to his proposals on high- speed rail and job training, Lesser has prioritized bringing technological innovation to western Massachusetts. He worked to pass the Mass Life Sciences Bill, a major investment in grants like the $3.9 million received by Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, to create a new clinical trials unit. Lesser has also proposed a remote worker relocation program, which would pay $10,000 over two years to employees that could move to western Massachusetts to work from home. His plan is similar to one currently in place in Vermont. = Protecting seniors = Sen. Eric Lesser visits the East Longmeadow Senior Center. In May 2014, Lesser published an opinion piece in the Springfield Republican detailing a plan to support the increasing population of adults over 65 in Western Massachusetts. Lesser believes that in-home healthcare should be more affordable so that seniors can stay in their homes as long as possible. His plan also includes two points to protect the physical and financial security of the elderly. Lesser wrote that the state should provide increased oversight of in-home healthcare agencies in order to reduce instances of elder abuse, and he supports the increased availability of computer and financial literacy education opportunities to decrease the number of seniors who fall victim to online and phone scams. Since 2017, Lesser has hosted an annual \\"Thrive After 55\\" Wellness Fair where participating organizations answer questions and offer information about their resources to local seniors. = National Issues  Transportation  On January 25, 2017, Lesser sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to include a high-speed rail line between Springfield and Boston on his list of infrastructure priorities.  Transgender Rights  In response to President Trump's transgender military policy, Lesser sent a letter to Governor Baker in June 2019 asking him to oppose Trump's ban and publicly reaffirm support for transgender service in the Massachusetts National Guard.  Electoral College  After Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the 2016 U.S. presidential election because Donald Trump won more votes in the Electoral College, Lesser filed a resolution in the Massachusetts State Senate calling on the U.S. Congress to propose an amendment to abolish of the Electoral College. \\"It has now been twice in 16 years, and five times total in American history, that a president and vice president have been elected by winning a majority of the Electoral College, despite the fact that they lost the national popular vote,\\" Lesser said in a statement. \\"Given the importance of empowering voters to believe every vote counts in a presidential election, the repeal of the Electoral College merits a thorough discussion and examination.\\"  Outside of the State House  Lesser holds a number of national recognitions, including a Rodel Fellowship in Public Leadership at the Aspen Institute. He is the co-chair of the Future of Work Initiative at NewDEAL, a national network of pro-growth, progressive state and local elected officials. He also sits on the Advisory Board of the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for student loan borrowers. Lesser is a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Lesser has consulted with HBO on the television show Veep since 2012. Lesser has taught workshops on campaigns, elections, and public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a class at the University of Massachusetts Amherst on millennial leadership in local and state politics.  Personal life  Lesser married attorney Alison Silber on December 31, 2011.

While serving in the Mediterranean Sea she captured the Italian submarine . Early history Built as Lady Madeline in 1934 by Cook, Welton and Gemmell, she was operated as a fishing trawler by Jutland Amalgamated Trawlers, of Hull, until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. She was requisitioned by the Admiralty and converted for war use, principally against submarines. She was renamed Moonstone and commissioned with the pennant number T90.Hull Trawlers Service history Moonstone was posted to the Mediterranean as part of the 4th AS (anti-submarine) Patrol Group, and later to the Red Sea. In June 1940 Italy joined the war against the Allies, and the Royal Navy commenced operations against the Regia Marina. On 16 June Moonstone rescued the crew of the Norwegian tanker James Stove which had been sunk by the Italian submarine earlier that day. On 18 June Galileo Galilei was sighted and attacked by British aircraft, and Moonstone was dispatched to find her. On 19 June Moonstone obtained an ASDIC contact and attacked, dropping two depth charges. The submarine’s captain, realizing his opponent was smaller and less heavily armed, and troubled by an escape of poisonous fumes in the boat, chose to fight on the surface, where he would still have the advantage. Breaking the surface Galileo Galilei’s crew manned her guns and got off the first shot, but this missed; Moonstone bore down and fired, hitting the submarine’s bridge and killing or wounding the bridge crew, including her captain. Unable to continue, Galileo Galilei surrendered and was taken in hand by the trawler. Later, the destroyer joined up, and took the submarine in tow to Aden. The submarine had suffered 12 killed and 4 wounded; Moonstone had no casualties. For this effort Moonstones skipper, bosun William Moorman, was awarded the DSC and referred for an officer's commission.

Altes Museum, Berlin Maurizio Nannucci, More than meets the eye MAXXI Roma 2015 Biography Maurizio Nannucci was born in Florence on April 20, 1939. After studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence and Berlin, he attended electronic music courses and worked for several years with experimental theater groups, drawing sceneries. In 1968 he founded the Exempla publishing house and the Zona Archives Edizioni in Florence, still playing an intense editorial activity by publishing artist's books and records, multiple copies and other artists' records. From 1974 to 1985 he was part of the non-profit space Zona in Florence, organizing over two hundred exhibitions and events. In 1981 he created Zona Radio, a radio station dedicated to artists' sound work and experimental music, and in 1998 founded together with Paolo Parisi, Massimo Nannucci, Carlo Guaita, Paolo Masi and Antonio Catelani, Base / Progetti per l'arte, a nonprofit space of artists for other artists. Since the mid-1960s, he explored the relationship between art, language and image, between light-colour and space, creating unprecedented conceptual ideas, characterized by the use of different media: neon, photography, video, sound, editions and artist's books. From 1967 are the first neon works that bring to his work a more diverse dimension of meaning and a new perception of space. Since then, Nannucci's research has always been focused in an interdisciplinary dialogue between work, architecture and urban landscape, as demonstrated by collaborations with Renzo Piano, Massimiliano Fuksas, Mario Botta, Nicolas Grimshaw and Stephan Braunfels. He has participated several times at the Venice Biennale, Documenta in Kassel and the Biennales of Sao Paulo, Sydney, Istanbul, Valencia, and has exhibited in the most important museums and galleries all over the world.

He studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Holubitschka lived and worked in Düsseldorf. At the Ruhrakademie in Schwerte he taught the subject painting.  Life  After leaving school, Hans-Jörg Holubitschka went on the recommendation of his former art teacher at the high school to Düsseldorf to study from 1980 to 1988 at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in the class of Gerhard Richter. There he met other students, for example his fellow painter Thomas Bernstein. Other later fellow artists with whom he already be friends during the Academy times, as Stefan Demary, Heinz Hausmann, Bernard Lokai and more accompanied him on his other artistic projects.  Work  After finishing his studies, Hans-Jörg Holubitschka devoted to the landscape painting. His favorite subjects are landscapes views among others in southern France, Italy, England with Scotland, Ireland, Spain, landscapes in Germany including his native Westerwald, but also the Swiss Alps and the Bavarian Alps. The \\"Urban Landscapes\\" and cityscapes, he has painted, include the following cities: Düsseldorf, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris, Orvieto, Mallorca, Rome and Venice. Since the year 2012, he also dealt with the theme of cultural landscape. For this purpose, it is one of the artificially designed landscapes, such as golf course landscapes. He has implemented picturesque new visual landscapes of the following places: The Fifteens (Düsseldorf Golf Club), The Seventh (Hubbelrath Golf Club), Princeville Hawaii, St Andrews Scotland, Oubaai (South Africa) and Les Dunes United States. Hans-Jörg Holubitschka did not paint the representational quality of a landscape. The landscape was the medium for him to give the viewer a familiar motif access to its \\"soul pictures\\". He made use of color and its composition possibilities as an instrument to mental states to express. His images reflect in their color effects and excesses of the painter of the American Color Field painting like Mark Rothko, Barnet Newman or Clyfford Still. While these painters moved in perfect abstract space, it took Hans-Jörg Holubutischka, figurative elements of the landscape into abstract color fields to convert.

She had at least two brothers, Luis Guerra Ramírez de la Vega, and Vega Ramirez. She married Joseph Tinedo by whom she had a daughter, Francisca Antonia. On one day in 1816, Leonor peered out her window wearing a blue hair ribbon, blue being the color of the separatist forces. She was arrested by Spanish forces. Colonel Juan Aldama threatened Leonor with torture if she did not recant her political convictions and reveal fellow sympathizers. Leonor refused. From a young age, she supported the cause of independence. Like her father, she is remembered for her act of rebellion against the royal forces, wearing a blue ribbon in her hair, which was the symbol used by the separatist forces, and ultimately cost her her life. For punished, Leonor was paraded through Cumaná on a donkey while receiving 200 lashes. Around every corner, she was admonished, to give in, to which she always replied \\"Viva la Patria, death to the tyrants!\\" After fainting, Leonor was taken home. From then on, she refused food and medical care. Leonor died in Cumaná later in 1816. The school Unidad Educativa Leonor de la Guerra in Nueva Esparta, Venezuela, is named in her honor.

The pin is sewn onto the bridle, which is a 7- to 10-foot-long piece of nylon webbing connected to the pilot chute. The closing pin passes through the closing loop and in doing so, secures the main container of a skydiving rig, keeping the parachute from deploying prematurely. When the pilot chute is thrown out by the skydiver and catches air, it pulls the closing pin from the closing loop and allows the main parachute to be released from the container and inflate. Fashion Because the closing pin is seen by many skydivers as a life-saving piece of equipment, it has become a symbol of the sport for those who have experienced only one tandem jump and also for those who have hundreds and thousands of jumps. The closing pin is often worn as a piece of jewelry on necklaces and bracelets. It is also a popular tattoo among skydivers. Used as a fashion accessory, the closing pin serves as a symbol – allowing skydivers to recognize one another and their mutual love of the sport.

By 1950, they had become the largest wool manufacturer west of Cleveland, Ohio. The origins of the factory started in Sellwood in 1901 but after a fire destroyed the mill two years later owners decided to rebuild in St. Johns. Portland Woolen Mills offered several worker programs including baseball, basketball and bowling teams; a cafeteria and a library. Labor disputes started during the 1934 textile workers strike when Portland Woolen Mills employees walked-off the job for two days. Two years later works held a strike and were granted representation by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) labor union. The factory filled contracts for the United States Federal Government during much of its history, primarily making blankets for the armed forces. For their work in producing blankets during World War II, the Portland Woolen Mills won an Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award. The factory closed in 1960 after almost 59 years of service. History The Portland Woolen Mills in Sellwood, Oregon, which burnt to the ground in 1904. The following year the mill relocated to St. Johns, Oregon. Founded in Sellwood, Oregon, in 1901, the Portland Woolen Mills relocated to the town of St. Johns in 1904 after a fire destroyed their old factory. Their old factory was a total loss, costing them US$150,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation). The property the new factory was on consisted of four buildings over five acres of land. The main factory was a 100 ft. by 200 ft. brick and concrete two-story. Other buildings on the site included a 45 ft. by 50 ft. boiler and engine room and a 40 ft. by 100 ft. wool weaving warehouse. The total cost of the new St. Johns plant was US$600,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation). The company reportedly turned a US$300,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation) profit in 1906. In 1911, a female worker was critically injured when she got caught in a belt which caused her to be hit in the head by the machinery. At its inception, the mill could produce 1,500 yards of wool per day. By 1913, that number was nearly 60,000 yards per day. During a large town-wide fire in 1905, the Portland Woolen Mills suffered US$300 worth (US$ adjusted for inflation) of damage. In 1913, the mill constructed a new 80 ft. by 200 ft. building on the site which cost US$600,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation). Vents in the roof were added to the entire building during the renovations. Lewis I. Thompson was the architect who designed the new building. During this time, the company decided to install a cafeteria and library for their employees. The renovations allowed management to add 500 new workers which doubled their overall productivity. A drawing of the Portland Woolen Mills in St. Johns. A fire broke out in the factory in March 1914 causing US$600,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation). In 1917, the plant reported a US$700,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation) profit. Several orders came in that year from automobile manufacturers who were using wool upholstery in their vehicles. The rebuilding began a few days after the disaster. During World War I, the Portland Woolen Mills were contracted to manufacture clothing and blankets for the United States Armed Forces. They also bid on contracts for Russian soldiers on the Eastern Front. When the war was dying down, production at the plant dropped after demand started to curtail. After failing to meet increasing demand in 1919, the woolen mills added 150 new employees to rectify the issue. During World War II, the United States federal government granted the Portland Woolen Mills contracts for wool blankets. In 1943, the factory won an Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for their production. By 1950, the Portland Woolen Mills had become the largest wool manufacturer in the United States west of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1951, the Portland Woolen Mills won a US$200,000 contract for the United States Armed Forces. From its 1935 to 1952, the Portland Woolen Mills were led by executive director Charles H. Carter, who died two years after his retirement. His son Charles H. Carter, Jr. succeed him in that position. In 1960, the Portland Woolen Mills announced it would cease operations. At the time of the closure, the factory employed 100 people. Carter cited increasing production costs due to foreign competition as the reason he closed the mill. Employee activities Two female employees of the Portland Woolen Mills circa 1940s In 1907, the Portland Woolen Mills management donated US$300 (US$ adjusted for inflation) to buy books for the new St. Johns library. In 1921, management put on a melodrama play for their employees entitled The Fruit of His Folly by playwright Arthur Lewis Tubbs. A bowling team of Portland Woolen Mills workers was organized in 1916. They played in a league which featured other St. Johns clubs and businesses. The Portland Woolen Mills organized a baseball team for their workers in the 1920s. They played in a league with different companies and town teams including Standard Oil and Camas, Washington. In the mid-1920s, the Portland Woolen mills organized a basketball team who played in a city-wide league. Labor disputes A case brought by female Portland Woolen Mills employees to the Oregon Industrial Welfare Commission in 1919 argued that they should not have to work longer than 8-hour days for a maximum of 48 hours a week. Management countered with a 10-hour a day limit, but the commission sided with the workers by restricting the hours female employees could work per their request. In 1920, management threatened to temporarily close the plant after demand diminished. However, workers negotiated for the payroll to be cut by nine percent to keep the factory open. One-hundred workers for the Portland Woolen Mils walked off the job in September 1934 in solidarity with textile workers who had been striking across the United States. The walk-out had little effect as workers returned to their positions in the factory after two days. Two years later, workers had a three- week strike which was successful in getting them represented by a labor union. A three-week-long series of protests involving 500 Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) employees of the Portland Woolen Mills, a contract was agreed upon and full productivity was returned.

Life Gustaf Britsch was born into a middle-class Swabian family of teachers. He left his family early. He first studied architecture at the University of Stuttgart and worked as an architect in Stuttgart. Then he enrolled in 1906 at the Munich University of Philosophy and studied with Hans Cornelius and Theodor Lipps. He created theories to the understanding of art by early 1907, which were received by Adolf von Hildebrand and Konrad Fiedler. In 1909 he founded in Florence the \\"Institute of Theoretical and Applied Art Studies\\". In 1910, he was encouraged by Cornelius to publish his theories. He moved back to Munich in 1911 and in 1912 opened the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Arts Science again on Theresa Street in Schwabing. In 1913 he spoke at the Congress of Aesthetics and General Art Studies in Berlin. Together with his student Egon Kornmann he represented a highly regarded school of thought about children's artistic development, which found its way into art education programs in Germany. These theories were also contradictory to others, such as Richard Mund. After Britschs' death, Kornmannn continued the Gustaf Britsch Institute in Starnberg. He also married Britschs' widow Louise, and clarified with her Britschs' designs and theories. So the Starnberger Kornmann-Britsch-circle (also Britsch-Kormann School) was founded, which employed art teacher Hans Herrmann.web.me.com (PDF) Kornmann was editor in the 1930s of the magazine The Shape. Gustaf Britsch Institute The Gustaf Britsch Institute for Art Research (also known as: Institute of Theoretical and Applied Arts Science; School of Fine Arts Starnberg; private art school Britsch-Kornmann; Gustaf Britsch Institute for comparative viewing art) existed from 1912 in Munich and then from about 1920 to about 1967 in a fashionable villa on Prinzenweg 13 in Starnberg, headed by Egon and Louise Kornmann.

The Forschungs- und Arbeitsgemeinschaft Irland (FAI – Research and Study Group on Irish Philately) is a registered society, a member of the Bund Deutscher Philatelisten (Association of German Philatelists), and is engaged in Irish philately. The FAI was founded on 24 July 1982 by Frank Holzmüller in order to establish a platform for research and communication for all those interested in Irish philately in the German Federal Republic.Cf.

Joachim Schaaf, Jubiläumstreffen am Ammeresee. In: Die Harfe Nr. 99, Summer 2007, p. 50–52, here p. 51. The FAI keeps in touch with the other philatelic Ireland societies all over the world and cooperates with the Irish postal administration An Post. The members meet regularly at regional meetings and the Annual General Meeting, which take place in all parts of Germany. The society publishes the members’ magazine Die Harfe (The Harp) three times per year. All aspects of Irish philately are treated in more than 200 pages annually. The first 30 volumes are also available digitally, on DVD or USB flash drive.30 Jahre Die Harfe (Nr. 1–116) in digitalisierter Form. In: Die Harfe Nr. 118/119, Spring/Summer 2012, p. 105. In particular, the magazine deals with Irish postal history. It encompasses, among others, old postal routes, the transport of mail on board overseas steamboats, national and international postal fees, and the Maltese Cross postmarks used in Ireland. Documentation of the postal history of the Irish independence movement is also an important field. Furthermore, the FAI researches the use of postmark machines, military postal history, postal censorship and post from prisoners of war, Irish postal stationery, international reply coupons, and revenue stamps. The FAI publishes philatelic literature; as of 2014 a series of 30 volumes have been released.FAI-Schriftenreihe (retrieved on 16 February 2014). By publishing this series, the FAI contributes to the progress of philatelic research in the field of Irish postal history. In the year of publication, all FAI members receive a copy of the new volume either for free or at a special rate, depending on the number of pages and retail price. FAI members can consult FAI experts on many different fields of Irish philately.FAI-Fachreferenten (retrieved on 16 February 2014). Since the mid-1990s, all publications (the members’ magazine as well as the novelties in the publication series) are edited completely bilingual in German and English. The publications of the FAI thus constitute an important link between the German- and the English-speaking philatelists and are accessible for collectors and researchers in the field of Irish philately all over the world with no language barrier.Cf.

It is located in one of the driest areas of the Black Desert (Harrat al-Shamah) of Eastern Jordan. Remains of dams have been found, the largest of which is a masonry gravity dam and the oldest known dam in the world. It was used as a protection from flash floods and it enabled the city to survive for 1500 years.  Discovery and history of investigation  Jawa was first reported by French explorer Antoine Poidebard, who flew over and photographed the site in 1931, mistaking it for Roman ruins. Before and after Poidebard's discovery, several archaeological expeditions came close to but missed the site. Nelson Glueck visited it in 1947 but apparently failed to notice its significance, describing Jawa as a \\"small, filthy spring [...] probably never more than a small police post.\\"Helms, pp. 15-16 Finally, in 1950, an expedition led by epigrapher F. V. Winnett reached the site and documented some of the inscriptions there. Amongst their number was Lankester Harding, who suggested that the remains were not Roman but in fact dated to the Early Bronze Age. Harding recommended the site to Svend Helms, who first visited the site in 1966 and directed excavations there between 1972 and 1976. In contrast to earlier assumptions about the site's lack of significance, Helms concluded that \\"Jawa is the best preserved fourth- millenium town yet discovered anywhere in the world: paradoxically in a place—the Black Desert—where it could hardly exist today and probably hardly when it was built.\\"  History  The town was built by a group of perhaps 2,000 migrants coming from the North or East.

The total annual flow down the wadi at Jawa is estimated to be 2,000,000 m3 per year arriving in a few dramatic winter floods with flows of 80–110 m3/s. Research suggests that the community at Jawa could survive on 3% of that total flow: if they could store it in sufficient quantities to last through the four dry summer months.Helms. pp.148,165,151 It would have to support their population of 2,000 to 5,000 as well as their large herds of sheep, goats and some cattle. Estimates based on bone counts indicate there may have been as many as 10,000 sheep and goats as well as 800 cattle. There were also 200 equids and 160 dogs.Helms. p.189. Analysis by Ilse Kohler From seed remains it is apparent that some of the water was also used for irrigation agriculture. The inhabitants ate barley, wheat, chickpeas, lentils and grapes.Helm. p.247. Analysis by G.H. Willcox The lifetime of the town was extremely short. Its maximum population may have reached 5,000.Helms. p.130 There is a fortified building in the center of the ruins of the original town. It is believed to date from 2000 to 1500 BC and is not associated with any other stone structures.Helms. p.6 Water supply system There are the remains of three dams across Wadi Rajil at Jawa, part of an extensive water supply system that included other smaller dams, channels and deflectors across the wadi to support the town. Two are deflection dams meant to channel water into a number of reservoirs. The third was an attempt at a reservoir dam, completely blocking the flow of the flood. It appears not to have survived more than one season. The other two probably ceased to function within a generation. The largest is a masonry gravity dam and the oldest known dam in the world, with recent carbon-14 dating putting initial construction between 3500-3400 BC. It was designed to divert water into three depressions to the west of the settlement. The feed canal was also used to fill a natural cave. The dam itself was built at an angle across the curve of the wadi. It may not have reached from bank to bank. It is speculated that even if the structure only withstood the flood for a short time some water would have been diverted to the reservoirs. The largest reservoir had a double-wall, 80 metres long and 4–5 metres high, in-filled with sand and ash. Excavators found traces of revetments and a rudimentary apron on the up-stream face.Helms. pp.174,175 An attempt to build a larger wall to expand the capacity of the reservoirs beside the town was not completed. The small amount of rainfall, perhaps 150 mm per year, which fell on local micro-catchments was also harnessed by a long series of primitive canals leading to the reservoirs. This would have been a significant contribution in maintaining water levels between floods.Helms. pp.181,182 See also * References Category:Archaeological sites in Jordan Category:Gravity dams Category:Dams in Jordan Category:Masonry dams ","title":"Jawa, Jordan"},{"id":"41960195","text":"Head of Samar west Desert Kite Desert kites are constructions aimed at trapping game animals, found in the Middle East.

One review of 16 desert kites from the Negev and northeast Sinai, published in the Journal of Arid Environments in 2010, found that desert kites in these deserts were established in the late 4th millennium BCE or early 3rd millennium BCE and had ceased to function by the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE. Dating was established through radiocarbon, luminescence, and material culture methods. This and other research established that kites were a more recent phenomenon than some had earlier suggested. Desert kites consist of long dry-stone walls converging on a neck which opens into a confined space which was used as the killing floor. The length of the walls can run to hundreds of metres and can be best seen from the air. They were given their name by pilots who first saw them from the air in the 1920s.Helms, Svend (1981) Jawa.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family and the TGF- beta superfamily. This group of proteins is characterized by a polybasic proteolytic processing site that is cleaved to produce a mature protein containing seven conserved cysteine residues. Members of this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. Studies in yeast suggest that the encoded protein is involved in aging. This protein is transcribed from a monocistronic mRNA as well as a bicistronic mRNA, which also encodes growth differentiation factor 1. Ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) is a ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of C18 ceramide in a fumonisin B1-independent manner, and is primarily expressed in the brain. It can also be found in low levels in skeletal muscle and the testis. Within the cell, CerS1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and golgi apparatus membrane. CerS1 has two isoforms and isoform 1 may recycle from the golgi to the ER. CerS1/GDF1 mRNA is strongly expressed in muscle and brain, and was also found in heart and lung. Within the brain, CerS1 is the primary CerS expressed in most neurons. In white matter, it can only be found in low levels. In a recent experiment performed in mice in 2012, ablation of neuronal CerS1 decreased levels of sphingolipids, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelin. Although the brains in these mice appeared to develop normally, researchers observed atrophy of the cerebellum, and Purkinje neurons appeared to degenerate. Granule cells also showed a 6 times increased rate of apoptosis. Behaviorally, the mice expressed motor and neurophysiological impairment.  Structure  Unlike other mammalian ceramides, CerS1 does not appear to have a Hox-like domain. It is functionally and structurally distinct from other CerS and is found in an entirely different branch of the phylogenetic tree.  Clinical significance  On application of various stresses, CerS1 turns over rapidly by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, suggesting that it has a short half life. It has been suggested that CerS1 is involved with the regulation of the growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), based on the information that C18 ceramide levels are lower in HNSCC tissues than in normal tissue. CerS1, in particular amongst other CerS, has also been shown to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, and vincristine.

Background  It is not known when Fang Gao was born, but it is known that he was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. In his youth, he served on staff at the mansion of the Tang chancellor Cui Yin. According to the Old History of the Five Dynasties, he later took up residence at Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) due to a disturbance.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 96. (This might be referring to Cui's death at the hands of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), in 904.)See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264.  During Later Tang  In 926, by which time Tang had long fallen, and the emperor of central China was the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan commissioned his adoptive son Li Congke as the acting military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered at Hezhong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Either at that time or shortly after, when Li Congke went to Hezhong to take over the circuit command, Fang Gao went to greet him on the road, and requested to serve on his staff. Li Congke was pleased with him, and made him in charge of the guests in Li Congke's household. In 934, Li Congke overthrew then-emperor, his adoptive brother (Li Siyuan's biological son) Li Conghou, and became emperor. Apparently shortly after, Fang was made the acting secretary at the office of the chief of staff (樞密院, Shumi Yuan), and thereafter a director of palace affairs (宣徽使, Xuanhuishi). In fall 935, Fang was made one of the chiefs of staff, serving with Li Congke's brother-in-law Zhao Yanshou. However, Li Congke's close associate Liu Yanlang () served as deputy chief of staff, and it was said that Li Congke listened to Liu, as well as a scholar at the office of chief of staff, Xue Wenyu (), far more than he did Zhao or Fang. Fang himself made few decisive suggestions, often acting ambiguously when presented proposals. Indeed, when intelligence reports and requests came from the two key commands on the border between Later Tang and its northern rival Khitan Empire — Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), then commanded by Zhao's adoptive father Zhao Dejun, and Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), then commanded by another brother-in-law of Li Congke's, Shi Jingtang, Fang would often fall asleep at the chief of staff meetings. As a result, the matters ended up being ruled on by Liu. It was said that Liu used the opportunity to extract bribes from military governors and prefects, giving them prize assignments for greater bribes, causing much resentment from the generals toward Li Congke, who was unaware of the situation.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. However, Fang (along with imperial scholars Li Song and Lü Qi () did do what they could to dissuade Li Congke from an idea that he had that they believed would be disastrous — moving Shi from Hedong to Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) — believing that Shi would rebel if he did so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In summer 936, by which time Lü was no longer imperial scholar, there was a night when Li Song had the night off, and Xue was on duty, attending to Li Congke. Xue took the opportunity to persuade Li Congke that Shi would rebel anyway, and that it was better to let him rebel now. Li Congke agreed, and therefore issued an edict moving Shi from Hedong to Tianping. Shi did in fact rebel, and thereafter, with aid from the Khitan, defeated Later Tang forces Li Congke sent against him and then approached the capital Luoyang. Li Congke and his family committed suicide, ending Later Tang.  During Later Jin  Shi Jingtang, whom Khitan's Emperor Taizong had declared to be emperor of a new state of Later Jin, entered Luoyang and took over Later Tang's territory. In an edict that Shi issued after entering Luoyang that declared a general pardon, he, excepting them from the general pardon, ordered the deaths of Li Congke's close associates Zhang Yanlang, Liu Yanhao, and Liu Yanlang. He singled out several officials whom he stated as not complicit with Li Congke (his justification for rebelling against Li Congke was that Li Congke, as an adoptive son, was an usurper of the Later Tang throne) — Ma Yinsun, Fang Gao, Li Zhuanmei (), and Han Zhaoyin — such that they were removed from their posts but spared their lives. In 939, Shi, apparently viewed his punishment of Ma, Fang, Han, and Li Zhuanmei to be too harsh (as he pitied them for being in poverty), commissioned them various offices — in Fang's case, a general of the imperial guards — but then immediately ordered them into retirement (i.e., to allow them to draw pensions without allowing them to return to the government).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Fang would die in 944, during the reign of Shi's nephew and successor Shi Chonggui, at Luoyang.

Career Equestrian statue of Pedro II Francisco Manuel Chaves Pinheiro was born in Rio de Janeiro on 5 September 1822. His parents were Úrsula Maria das Virgens and Manoel Bernardes Chaves. He entered the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Academia Imperial das Belas Artes) in 1835, at the age of thirteen. He registered in the Drawing class as Francisco Manoel Chaves de Bragança, adopting his mother's name. He enrolled in the sculpture class in 1836 as a student of Marc Ferrez. Chaves Pinheiro was to become one of Ferrez's best-known pupils. In December 1845 at the age of 23 he won the Academy's gold medal for his Allegory of the Liberation of Brazil. Chaves Pinheiro married Narcissa Ferreira Netto, and then Amelia Josephine Ramos. He had two daughters with his second wife, Claudiana and Narcisa. He was a member of the Masonic lodge of Rio de Janeiro. At the age of 29 he was appointed professor of Sculpture and Statuary at the Academy. He held this post for thirty-three years, from 1851 until his death in 1884. At the Academy Chaves Pinheiro taught, created sculptures and also sat on committees to analyze submissions from European students applying for scholarships, and to decide on Brazilian submissions to international exhibitions. Chaves Pinheiro died of heart problems on 19 October 1884 in Rio de Janeiro. Work Most of Chaves Pinheiro's work was made at the Academy starting with clay models that were then finished in plaster, bronze or iron with help from his students. In some cases he started with a sketch model about 1/3 of the final work's size. He made some works in marble or wood, but was best known for his bronze portraits of prominent people. The Academy donated the material for this work, and the Imperial government was the main customer. This avoided the need to maintain a studio, difficult at that time in Rio de Janeiro. However, it imposed some rigidity over aesthetic standards. Most of his work followed conventional neoclassical lines, although much of his work also showed a Romantic inclination. In 1864 Chaves Pinheiro presented a model for a huge equestrian statue of the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil to be executed in bronze. The model was presented at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1867, but the project was not realized since Pedro II refused the honor, preferring that the money be spent on public education.

Schneider & Cie, issued 1. October 1912 Th. Schneider was a French automobile manufacturer. The Société anonyme des automobiles Th. Schneider was registered at Besançon on 16 June 1910.http://www.scriponet.com/images/Descript/2/216.JPG Vehicle production finally ended early in 1930, some ten months after the company's second declaration of bankruptcy, in March 1929. A significant proportion of the manufacturer's output was exported to England. The founder and his name By the time he established the company that carried his name, Schneider was already a very well seasoned automobile manufacturer. With Edouard Rochet, Schnieder had been involved since 1889 or 1894 with the Lyon based Rochet- Schneider company. Although Schneider had apparently been registered at birth with the name \\"Théodore Schneider\\", many friends and business partners knew him as \\"Théophile Schneider\\". Use of the name Th. Schneider for his automobile company avoided the need to arbitrate between the two names. Th. Schneider publicity, published in Le pays de France, 1st year, nbr 3, page 4, 10 July 1914. The cars=Pre-war The manufacturer started out producing a range of cars with side valve 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines. In most respects these were conventional cars, apart from the \\"dashboard mounted\\" radiators, positioned ahead of the driver but behind the (front mounted) engine. By the time war broke out in August 1914, the Th. Schneider range comprised seven 4-cylinder engined cars with engine sizes that ranged from 1.8-litres to 6.1-litres. There was also a 3.2-litre 6-cylinder engined model. During these years the manufacturer also participated in motor racing, taking part in the French Grand Prix in two successive years. 1920s In October 1919 the manufacturer took a stand at the 15th Paris Motor Show, and was already exhibiting a range of four different cars, with wheelbases of between and . They all used 4-cylinder engines with cylinder diameters that placed them respectively in the 12HP, 14HP, 18HP and 26HP car tax bands. The engine capacities were 2,292cc, 3,030cc, 3,958cc and 5,500cc. The cars offered for the 1920 model year were not strikingly different from those that had been offered before the war, but the radiators were mounted in front of the engines, which by now was becoming standard practice across most of the French auto-industry (although Renault would persist in placing the radiator behind the engine till 1929). During the early 1920s the Th. Schneider range became broader (and more complex). The business prospered through the middle 1920s. One of the best remembered models, built since 1922, was the Th.

At the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924 the manufacturer was offering this car with a \\"Torpedo\\" type body for 29,000 francs. From the volume makers, a \\"Torpedo\\" bodied Renault 10HP was listed only 22,500 francs at the same show and a comparably sized \\"all-steel\\" Citroën Type B10 was offered for even less, but the mass-produced Citroën still had serious structural issues to overcome, and at this stage the French automarket was still able to absorb cars in this class from the smaller automakers as well as from the high volume companies. Financial Troubles The company was declared bankrupt for the first time in November 1921, but was able to persuade the court to permit resumption of its activities thirteen months later. Th. Schneider was then able to enjoy several years of successful business due to the excellent reputation of its cars. Nevertheless, financial problems hit the business again in 1928, ending in a second bankruptcy in March 1929. Production was progressively run down, presumably in order to use up existing inventory, but early in 1930 the factory doors were closed for the last time.

Simons progressed to competitive athletics, joining Telford Athletics club where he initially specialised in the long jump and triple jump. In 2008 he was accepted into University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC) and joined the University's athletics club. While at Cardiff, he began to concentrate more on his sprinting competing in the 60m and 100m events. He achieved some success as a sprinter, becoming Welsh 60m champion. Simons attended William Brookes School. In 2012 while at UWIC he replied to an advert from British Bobsleigh who were searching for 'future Olympians'. He was accepted into the team, and was soon competing at international level. It was announced on 22 January 2014 that Simons would be competing in the bobsleigh for Great Britain at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in the four- man bobsleigh; racing in the second team (GBR2) along with John Baines, Craig Pickering and pilot Lamin Deen. Commenting on the news, Simons said that \\"It means the world to me to be selected to compete for Team GB at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\\". It was his debut Olympics. In the process of qualification for GBR2, Simons said that there was a nervous tension, but that they got through to competing at the Olympics.

Plot Following their flight from Turks and Caicos, Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) and Margot Tyrell (Helena Bonham Carter) hopscotch around Europe to evade capture by MI5. After spotting one of his former recruits, disguised as a passing jogger, Johnny relocates once again and instructs former colleague Rollo Maverley (Ewen Bremner) to leak news of Prime Minister Alec Beasley's (Ralph Fiennes) corrupt dealings with Stirling Rogers (Rupert Graves) and his Bridge Foundation. Margot secretly keeps in touch with Johnny's pregnant daughter Julianne (Felicity Jones). In London, Acting Director General Jill Tankard (Judy Davis) contacts Deputy Prime Minister Anthea Catcheside (Saskia Reeves) and offers her services in aiding Catcheside's embattled husband. Johnny and Margot separate on their way back into Britain in order to confound their pursuers. While Johnny successfully disappears and travels via the English Channel, an errant MI5 agent runs into Margot on a train and alerts his superiors. Rollo aids Margot's escape and delivers her to Reverend Bernard Towers (Malcolm Sinclair), a friend of Johnny's from Cambridge. Johnny contacts Belinda Kay (Olivia Williams), editor-in-chief of The Independent, and details the workings of the financial deals surrounding Beasley, Rogers and The Bridge. Kay's publication of the information causes Rogers to resign from the foundation and admit to his misdeeds, despite Beasley's assurances. Julianne contacts Margot after learning that her boyfriend (Shazad Latif) was an MI5 plant who has bugged her flat. Johnny arranges a meeting with Beasley at 10 Downing Street, demanding he call off the surveillance against his daughter. Beasley reveals that he intends to leave office and assume the title of Consul General to Iran, with American funding and U.N. cover. Johnny is then summoned to a meeting with Tankard, who reveals that she engineered Beasley's downfall after seeing the extent of the intelligence that started the whole scandal. Through her burying of Bill Catcheside's legal troubles, Tankard has Anthea, Beasley's planned successor, in her pocket. Tankard asks Johnny to return to MI5, an offer he reluctantly accepts in return for Julianne and Margot's safety and Maverley's reinstatement into MI5. Back in Margot's apartment, Johnny sees Margot leaving for Hong Kong to work in a start-up. Margot mentions that Julianne is in labour, accompanied by her mother. The film closes with scenes of Margot leaving, Johnny walking across London to the MI5 headquarters, and Julianne giving birth to her child.

Games which can be seen as bandy were played in the Fens in the 18th Century. The first English governing body for bandy, the National Bandy Association, was founded in 1891. The first rules were written down by Charles Goodman Tebbutt in 1882. Some English sports clubs had both football and bandy on their programme in the 19th Century, playing bandy when there was snow and ice in the winter time, for instance Nottingham Forest F.C..

In 1735 Moral Sánchez took steps to promote the production of naval stores, spars and masts to supply Cuban shipbuilders, but subsequent governors did little to continue this effort.L. Holmes, Jack; Ware, John. Juan Baptista Franco and Tampa Bay, 1756 - FIU Digital Collections. That same year, he complained to the viceroyalty of New Spain that the merchants of Puebla (in modern Mexico) made a fifty percent profit on all goods shipped to Florida. The following year, the British captured a Spanish ship carrying supplies and money from New Spain to the Spanish soldiers of Florida. Due to the resulting shortage of food, Moral decided to pay them with rum to try to alleviate their hunger or at least make them forget it temporarily. During his administration, Moral Sánchez ordered Captain Rodrigo de Ortega to make a list of all the Native American provinces and towns, both Christian and unconverted, that once paid obeisance to the Spanish Crown. By 1736, the widely dispersed Franciscan missions of Spanish Florida had been reduced to a few in the area around St. Augustine, and more Indians in the interior were beginning to exchange goods with British and French traders. In the same year, Moral Sánchez reached a compromise with General James Oglethorpe, the governor of the British colony of Georgia, and signed a treaty with his representative, Charles Dempsey, by which the St. Johns River was recognized as a boundary between the neighboring colonies. Both parties agreed to control their Indian allies to try to avoid clashes each other. Accepting the engineer Antonio de Arredondo's recommendations to improve St. Augustine's water and land defenses, in 1737 Moral Sanchez ordered the construction of two small wooden fortresses where the Indian trail to Apalachee crossed the St. Johns, including blockhouses, barracks, storehouses and batteries. One was built at Picolata on the east side, and another, Fort San Francisco de Pupo, on the opposite bank. On March 12, 1737, Moral Sánchez was arrested, forced to leave the governorship, and recalled to Spain; he was replaced by Manuel Joseph de Justís.

CALCE is the largest electronic products and systems research center focused on electronics reliability and is dedicated to providing a knowledge and resource base to support the development of competitive electronic components, products, and systems. CALCE is located at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, and was founded by Professor Michael Pecht.  Overview  CALCE was created in 1985 with support from the United States National Science Foundation as a University Industry Cooperative Research Center. Since that time, CALCE has made significant contributions in the following areas: * Design for Reliability and Physics- based Reliability Assessment * Accelerated Test Methods * Industry Standards Development * Electronics Supply Chain Management * Reliability Analysis and Qualification * Life Cycle Management and Obsolescence Management * Prognostics and Health Management CALCE has been a leader in the development of a number of IEEE, JEDEC, GEIA, and IEC Standards. CALCE publications have also influenced a number of crucial industry standards, including: * IEEE 1332: Reliability Program Standard * IEEE 1624: Guide for Organizational Reliability Capability * IEEE 1413: Standard Methodology for Reliability Prediction and Assessment for Electronic Systems and Equipment * JEP 148: Reliability Qualification of Semiconductor Devices Based on Physics of Failure Risk and Opportunity Assessment * GEIA-STD-0005-2: Standard for Mitigating the Effects of Tin Whiskers in Aerospace and High Performance Electronic Systems * IEC/PAS 62240 (also released as GEIA 4900): Use of Semiconductor Devices Outside Manufacturers’ Specified Temperature Ranges In the field of reliability analysis and qualification, CALCE processes and models have become standardized for physics-of-failure (PoF) based analyses of electronic systems. CALCE's achievements in reliability analysis and qualification include the concept of organizational reliability as the measure of the effectiveness of an organization's reliability program in terms of meeting customer requirements. A range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, household, industrial, medical, and telecommunication, actively use CALCE Simulation Assisted Reliability Assessment (SARA) software and accelerated testing approaches. Among organizations applying CALCE methods, the U.S. Army leads the way, creating and maintaining a PoF analysis group that uses calceSARA software and techniques to assess electronic designs for U.S. DoD programs. In one example application, analysis results from the calceSARA software were used to save $27 million in sustainment costs. NASA also applies CALCE PoF models in planning manned missions to the moon and Mars. International corporations such as Boeing, Daimler, General Electric, General Motors, and Vestas use CALCE PoF models to incorporate power electronic modules into products such as aircraft and hybrid vehicles. CALCE is at the forefront of research in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). CALCE formed the first collaborative research effort to address PHM applications. Through the work of their PHM Consortium, CALCE has developed a new paradigm for reliability prediction based on prognostics whereby sensor data is integrated into models that enable in-situ assessment of the deviation of a product from its expected normal operating condition. Additionally, CALCE has developed a prognostics roadmap that will be included in the ITRI semiconductor roadmap. In the field of Electronic Part Supply Chain Management, CALCE is the preeminent technical organization for thermal up-rating, counterfeit electronic part management, and electronic part obsolescence forecasting and management. CALCE developed the concept of up-rating, a process that mitigates the risk associated with using semiconductor devices outside manufacturer specifications. CALCE also developed the first quantitative analysis of lifetime buy sizes for electronic parts, which has allowed electronics integrators to reduce their stock inventories and save money. CALCE's parts management methodology forms the core of the Electronic Components Management Plan for the commercial avionics industry. CALCE has developed a number of methodologies, including obsolescence forecasting algorithms, which are used in leading tools and databases (i2, QTEC, PartMiner, and SiliconExpert). CALCE is also a leading supplier of tools and methodologies for strategic management of long field life systems. CALCE developed the most widely used methodology for managing electronic part obsolescence, which is employed by organizations such as Motorola, Northrop Grumman, and the U.S. DoD. For example, by applying CALCE methodologies, Motorola avoided $33 million in cost. Northrop Grumman was able to predict refresh dates for its F-22 radar 5 years earlier than previously possible. CALCE researchers and faculty have also created a graduate-level electronic product and systems curriculum at the University of Maryland that has graduated over 250 engineers. In addition to the graduate program, CALCE also provides professional development courses and Web-based seminars to engineers working in the industry. In 2008, CALCE was recognized by the United States National Science Foundation with the Alexander Schwarzkopf Prize for Technological Innovation. The Schwarzkopf Prize is awarded to former and current National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers that have had a significant impact on the world. CALCE won the award for its research on physics-of- failure reliability analysis methods and advanced supply chain management concepts for electronic products and systems. In 2009, CALCE received the Systems Engineering Excellence Award from the National Defense Industrial Association. The award was presented at the 12th Annual Systems Engineering Conference in San Diego, California. The award was established in 2003 to honor Lt. Gen. Thomas R. Ferguson, Jr., USAF, whose leadership embodied the highest ideals in Defense Systems development and deployment. The award was given to CALCE for demonstrating outstanding achievement in the practical application of Systems Engineering principles, promotion of robust systems engineering principles throughout the organization, and effective systems engineering process development during the previous year. CALCE systems engineering contributions have helped achieve significant cost savings through new and enhanced processes, procedures and/or concepts, increased mission capabilities, and substantially increased performance. In 2013, CALCE received the IEEE EAB/SA Standards Education Award. The award presented by the IEEE Educational Activities Board (EAB) and Standards Association Board of Governors (SA) was established to recognize those who have actively promoted the integration of standard into academic and corporate development programs, provided support for education about standards, promoted the importance of standards, made significant contributions of standards education materials, and provided content to support education about the standards setting process. The award is presented “for continued leadership in developing and promoting standards education in the field of reliability engineering.”  See also  * Physics of Failure * Prognostics References Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Multidisciplinary research institutes Category:University of Maryland Global Campus ","title":"Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering"},{"id":"41960680","text":"Justine Paris, real name Bienfait (1705September 1773) was a French courtesan and madam. She hosted several of the most famous brothels in mid 18th-century Paris and was one of the most known and successful of her trade. She and her brothel are portrayed in the memoirs of Casanova. She has been suggested to be the role model for the title character in Juliette by the Marquis de Sade. Biography Reportedly, she was a successful and internationally known courtesan before she opened the first of several brothels. For twenty years from about 1730, she operated a well-known brothel at Rue de Bagneux, Faubourg Saint-Germain, described as the perhaps most exclusive in contemporary Paris. In 1750, following a riot, she opened a brothel at Hotel du Roule which acquired fame and which was later taken over by Madame Carlier. Her brothel at Hotel du Roule was described by Casanova. It was located outside the city of Paris, near Chaillot, which meant that the clients could not go there by foot, which ensured that they mostly came from the upper class. While most brothels in mid 18th-century Paris had no more than three prostitutes working in their brothels at any one time, Justine Paris had 14 and she also employed a master of writing, dance and music to educate them. According to Casanova, she charged by the hour. As was other madams engaged in elite prostitution for clients from the nobility, the activity of Justine Paris was tolerated by the police as long as she functioned as a police agent and kept the police informed about the activity, business and life of their important clients and personnel. The rental of rooms to couples, in which none of the parties were prostitutes, but where their relationship was not accepted, such as in the case of a married woman and her lover, also took place, a service which was to be well known to occur in the famous brothel she was later to found in companionship with Gourdan. She changed staff about every six months, and according to Casanova, she always had prostitutes of a large variety of hair color, length and other different attributes to be able to meet with different forms of preferences from clients. She financed kept mistresses, so called dame entretenue or courtesans, in between patrons; clients could buy a member of her staff free by paying her debts and have her kept as his professional mistress, where the mistress could continue as a professional kept mistress to other wealthy men. In February 1752, Justine Paris was tried and incarcerated accused of having seduced a twelve-year-old from a noble family in a case that attracted attention. In 1773, she met her colleague Marguerite Gourdan at Bicêtre Hospital while undergoing a treatment for syphilis. Together, they founded what was to be the perhaps most famous of all brothels in 18th-century France, on the corner of rue des Deux Portes (now rue Dussoubs) and rue Saint- Sauveur. However, she died of syphilis in September of that year. Gourdan gave a funeral oration in her honour on 14 November 1773 at a gathering of Paris's elite prostitutes and madams organised by the Prince of Conti at his residence.

He was a cousin of the prominent Abbasid general Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin, thus belonging to the ruling family of Ushrusana. Mankjur accompanied al-Afshin in his campaign against the Khurramite Babak Khorramdin, and was later appointed as governor of Adharbayjan by him in 837. However, in 839, Mankjur, after refusing to give the caliph al-Mu'tasim some of Babak's booty, revolted against him. Al-Mu'tasim responded by sending against him Bugha al-Kabir, who managed to suppress his revolt and imprison him in Samarra. The affair of Mankjur raised suspicions about the loyalty of the al-Afshin, who was accused of encouraging the revolt, and contributed to the general's own downfall in the following year.  Name and background  Mankjur's nisbah is given variously by the sources as al-Ushrusani or al-Farghani,; respectively indicating an origin from the Central Asian provinces of Ushrusana or Farghana. Historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth believed that the first element of Mankjur's name may have been a corruption of the Turkish \\"ming/bing '1,000' or mengü 'eternal, everlasting,'\\" and that Mankjur may have been a Turkish slave soldier imported into Farghana prior to entering caliphal service.. , doubted that Mankjur's social status could be extrapolated from his name, as Turks were not only slave soldiers, but also likely members of the notable families in the eastern provinces. According to Vladimir Minorsky, the Mingechaur ford (now the Mingachevir reservoir) of the Kura River was named after Mankjur, who may have been active in the area during his time in Adharbayjan.  Career  Map of Adharbayjan in the ninth century. Mankjur was a kinsman of the Ushrusanan ruler al-Afshin, one of the leading military figures during the caliphate of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842); according to al- Ya'qubi he was the uncle of one of al-Afshin's sons. During al-Afshin's campaign against the Khurramite rebel Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan (835–837), Mankjur was dispatched by the general to fight against a separate revolt in Warthan. In 837, following the victory over Babak, Mankjur was appointed by al-Afshin to serve as his resident governor of Adharbayjan, while al-Afshin himself departed the province and returned to Samarra., who only notes that Mankjur was a kinsman of al-Afshin, without specifying the exact nature of the relationship; According to al-Tabari, Mankjur was believed to have acted in a corrupt manner during his governorship, appropriating for himself a large sum of money hidden away by Babak rather than forwarding it to the caliph. His alleged activities were soon revealed by the postmaster of Adharbayjan, who wrote to al-Mu'tasim and informed him about the money. Mankjur immediately wrote to the caliph in response, calling the accusation a lie, and the dispute between him and the postmaster quickly escalated. Mankjur eventually decided to kill the postmaster, but the latter sought refuge in Ardabil, prompting Mankjur to attack the city in retaliation. News of these events reached al-Mu'tasim, who responded by ordering al-Afshin to send someone to dismiss Mankjur. Al-Afshin accordingly dispatched Abi'l-Saj Devdad to the province, but allegations began to circulate that al-Afshin was in fact secretly supporting Mankjur, and al-Mu'tasim decided to send Bugha al-Kabir to fight Mankjur instead. Mankjur now came out openly in rebellion, but was soon defeated on the field and forced to retreat. He then rebuilt a mountain fortress which had been destroyed by Babak and fortified himself in it, relying on the mountain's inaccessibility to defend him. Despite this, his rebellion came to an end less than a month later; varying accounts state that he was either betrayed by his men and handed over to the caliphal army, or that he received a guarantee of safe conduct from Bugha. In any case, he was brought back by Bugha to Samarra, where al-Mu'tasim ordered him to be thrown into prison., who does not name the general that defeated Mankjur, but names Bugha as the one that transported him to Samarra; ; ; Mankjur's rebellion proved damaging to the reputation of al-Afshin, who was suspected of secretly corresponding with Mankjur and encouraging him to revolt. This belief, combined with other accusations of treason against the caliph, ultimately resulted in al-Afshin being arrested in 840 for conspiring against the state, and led to his imprisonment and death in the following year.; ;  Notes  Sources    Category:Rebellions against the Abbasid Caliphate Category:9th-century Iranian people Category:Generals of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Azerbaijan under the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Fergana ","title":"Mankjur al-Farghani"},{"id":"41960712","text":"Chris Watt (born August 17, 1990) is a former American football offensive guard who played three seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

Pioneer of string theory in the early 1970s, later on he became better known for his work with Giuliano Preparata at the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN); Biography During the 1970s, along with Sergio Fubini, Paolo Di Vecchia and Gabriele Veneziano, Del Giudice was at the center of an active school of theoretical physicists with close connections to Italy (with one of the Italian INFN and MIT financed \\"Bruno Rossi\\" exchange programs). He and his co- workers did fundamental work in string theory.The Birth of String Theory, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 352. For many years he was involved in quantum field theory and its relations with the physics of collective, coherent processes. He pioneered the quantum field theory of soft matter, focusing mainly on the structure of liquid water; in the latter part of his life he also investigated, together with Luc Montagnier, the relation between water and living matter. He worked at Niels Bohr Institute Copenhagen as well; then becoming a member of the International Institute of Biophotonics, Neuss, Germany. Awards Professor Del Giudice has been awarded the Prigogine Medal in 2009. On that occasion he delivered a plenary lecture on “The interplay of Quantum Field Theory and Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes as a conceptual basis for Biology and Ecosystem Dynamics.” Articles and Papers * 1964 Photofission of Bi, W and Ag from 300 to 1000 Mev De Carvalho, Cortini, Del Giudice, Potenza, Rinzivillo, Ghigo, Nuovo Cimento II 32, (1964), 293-297; * 1965 On singular potential scattering I Del Giudice, Galzenati, Nuovo Cimento, 38, 435-458; 40A 739-747; * 1967 Dispersive sum rules and low-energy limits Del Giudice, Galzenati, Nuovo Cimento, 52A (1967) 606-616; * 1969 Nonstrong amplitudes in a Veneziano-type model Ademollo, Del Giudice, Nuovo Cimento 63A (1969) 639-656; * 1969 A simplified dual model for Lepton-hadron sattering Ademollo, Del Giudice, Lettere a1 Nuovo Cimento 2 (1969) 345-350; * 1970 Dual models, Pomeranchuk term and crossing symmetry Del Giudice, Gabriele Veneziano, Lettere a1 Nuovo Cimento 3 (1970) 363-368; * 1970 Characterization of the physical states in dual resonance models Del Giudice, Di Vecchia, Nuovo Cimento 70A, (1970) 579-591; * 1971 Factorization and operator formalism in the generalized Virasoro Model Del Giudice, Di Vecchia, Nuovo Cimento 5A (1971) 90-102; * 1972 General properties of the dual resonance model Del Giudice, Paolo Di Vecchia, Fubini, Annals of Physics 70, (1972) 378-398; * 1972 Light cone physics and duality, Emilio Del Giudice, Paolo Di Vecchia, Sergio Fubini, Musto, Nuovo Cimento 12A (1972) 813-862; * 1974 Couplings of three excited particles in the dual resonance model Del Giudice, Di Vecchia, Fubini, Nuovo Cimento 19A (1974) 181-203; * 1976 Supersymmetric strings and colour confinement Ademollo, Brink, D’Adda, D’Auria, Napolitano, Sciuto, Del Giudice, Di Vecchia, Ferrara, Gliozzi, Musto, Pettorino, Phys.

Career Leitch started playing guitar in his teens. He accompanied many different acts at nightclubs in Montreal. He recorded with Sadik Hakim in the early 1970s. During the late 1970s, he worked in Toronto with Milt Jackson, Red Norvo, and Kenny Wheeler and went on tour with Fraser MacPherson in the Soviet Union. He was also a member of the Al Grey-Jimmy Forrest quintet. In the early 1980s he moved to New York City, where he played with Gary Bartz, Jaki Byard, Ray Drummond, John Hicks, Kirk Lightsey, Bobby Watson, and Smitty Smith. He recorded with Jeri Brown, Dominique Eade, Oscar Peterson, Woody Shaw, and Pete Yellin. He released his first solo album in 1981. He has worked as a journalist, photographer, and teacher. Leitch announced his retirement on July 21, 2015, on Facebook. \\"Due to a series of medical issues it is extremely unlikely that I will ever play the guitar again. I would like to send my heartfelt thanks to all those people who have enjoyed, bought, listened to, stolen (lol) or otherwise picked up on the music. The recordings (most of them) are still out there and available. I would also like to thank, of course, those great musicians who collaborated in the making of this music. The music on Sunday nights at Walkers is, for the time being, under the direction of bassist Sean Smith, with the exception of July 26 (bassist Harvie S).\\" However, since he was no longer able to play the guitar, he began arranging and composing music for a 12–14 piece ensemble. The Peter Leitch New Life Orchestra debuted at Club 75, the Bogardus Mansion, in New York City's fashionable TriBeCa district, November 30, 2018, and at this writing has a series of upcoming engagements at this location.pd Discography=As leader * Jump Street (Pausa, 1982) * Sometime in Another Life with George McFetridge (Jazz House, 1982) * Exhilaration (Uptown, 1985) * Red Zone (Reservoir, 1987) * On a Misty Night (Criss Cross, 1987) * Portraits and Dedications (Criss Cross, 1989) * Mean What You Say (Concord Jazz, 1990) * Trio/Quartet '91 (Concord Jazz, 1991) * From Another Perspective (Concord Jazz, 1993) * A Special Rapport (Reservoir, 1993) * Duality with John Hicks (Reservoir, 1994) * Colours & Dimensions (Reservoir, 1995) * At First Sight with Heiner Franz (Jardis, 1996) * Up Front (Reservoir, 1997) * Blues on the Corner (Reservoir, 1999) * Autobiography (Reservoir, 2004) * Self Portrait (Jazz House, 2007) * California Concert (Jazz House, 2013) * Landscape (Jazz House, 2014) As sideman * Gary Bartz, The Montreal Concert (DSM, 2001) * Jeri Brown, Unfolding the Peacocks (Justin Time, 1992) * Jaki Byard, Phantasies II (Soul Note, 1991) * Jaki Byard, My Mother's Eyes (M&I;, 2000) * Dominique Eade, When the Wind Was Cool (RCA, 1997) * Al Grey, Jimmy Forrest, O.D.

A Procurator of St Mark's, he acted as ambassador to the court of Charles V at Gand, but is mainly remembered for his role as one of the main promoters of public art and architectural projects in sixteenth-century Venice. He resided in the palazzo on San Polo now known as Ca Cappello Layard and oversaw its redevelopment.  Political Beginnings  He was born approximately in 1494, the son of Giambattista of Marino Cappello, a merchant and a nobleman, and Paola Garzoni, daughter of Marino Garzoni, who had been prominent in politics as procuratore de Citra, podestà of Verona, podestà of Mantua and finally duke of Candia. Antonio Cappello began his political career at a young age. In 1511 he was vice-podestà of Cologna Veneta, in 1515 an official at the Dogana da Mar - the maritime customs office- and in 1516, with a donation to the Republic of 200 ducats, he secured the office of provveditore and captain in Legnago, in the Verona countryside. There he amassed considerable rural wealth, as tax returns for 1537 show him in agrarian possessions measuring up to 1,200 Venetian campi in area. In 1519 he joined the savi alle decime, then, through a 400 ducat donation he secured access to the pregadi before purchasing for 8,000 ducats the office of procuratore de Supra, one of the two chief procurators of Saint Mark's, tasked with the conservation and expansion of the Basilica. He would maintain the prestigious role for 42 years.Colasanti, F. Antonio Cappello in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani- vol. 8, Treccani, Roma 1975, accessibile online a http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio- cappello_res-d1e3cfe8-87e9-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Construction of the fortress of Legnago with Michele Sanmicheli An important evolution in the career of Antonio Cappello was his nomination to provveditor sopra le fabbriche di Legnago- superintended over the fortification works of Legnago- in 1528, following the removal of the incompetent Pietro Tagliapietra. His task was to aid in the construction of the \\"fortezza nova\\" at Legnago, strongly desired by doge Andrea Gritti, a project under the direction of the commander-in-chief of the Venetian land forces Francesco Maria I della Rovere. The building of the fort however turned out to be a slow and contested process. On 15 December 1530 the chief architect working on the project, the Ferrarese Sigismondo de Fantis was fired for incompetency, to be replaced by his aide, the Veronese Michele Sanmicheli, whose Porta di San Martino had gained considerable acclaim as a tasteful yet function example of military engineering.A. Lotto, Aspetti della committenza veneziana in riferimento all'opera di Battista Zelotti tesi di dottorato di ricerca dell'università Ca' Foscari di Venezia (UNIVE), a.a. 2007-2008, p.107 Problems did not cease and in April 1532 the Republic's authorities, learning that the works were still far behind schedule removed Antonio Cappello from his role as superintendent. Both Michele Sanmichele and Francesco Maria della Rovere however defended his role and actions.  Embassy at Charles V’s court at Gand  The removal from office at Legnago did not halt his career. In 1533 he was nominated savio alle acque, then procurator in the \\"zonta dei nove\\"- an additional group of councillors that sat with the Council of Ten- then in 1539, together with the duke of Urbino, inspector of the fortresses of the Venetian mainland, and then, on 27 December 1539, with Vincenzo Grimani, special ambassador to the courts of Francis I in France and emperor Charles V in Flanders, with the objective of convincing the two rival monarchs to set aside their differences and join Venice in an anti-Ottoman coalition. The embassy did not however obtain significant political results: Francis I valued his Ottoman allies, and so the Venetians made for Charles V's court, where they were well received and Antonio Cappello received the title of count imperial, but failed to secure meaningful military support. In the following years, Antonio Cappello was appointed to more prestigious public offices: he sat in the consiglio alle acque, then in the committee that superintended the fortifications of Zadar, then he was provveditor over the Republic's fortifications, In 1543 finally he was dispatched to negotiate the purchase of the fortress of Marano Lagunare in eastern Friuli, seized the previous year by a band of rogue Venetian subjects loyal to Florentine renegade adventurer Piero Strozzi from the Austrians, and which threatened to draw the Republic into the Italian War of 1542-46 then raging between Habsburgs and Valois. The affair was concluded with the hefty disbursement in favour of Piero Strozzi of 35,000 ducats, in exchange of which the Venetians gained the small but strategic town.Colasanti, F. Antonio Cappello in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani- vol. 8, Treccani, Roma 1975, accessibile online a http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio- cappello_res-d1e3cfe8-87e9-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Sponsorship of public art The offices where he left the greatest mark were certainly those of artistic and architectural patronage. As procurator of Saint Mark's he was responsible of substantial restoration interventions in the Basilica of Saint Mark's, and also of the commencement of works on the Biblioteca Marciana. His experience in overseeing construction work saw him nominated as superintended over the bridge and works at Rialto together with Tommaso Contarini and Vettor Grimani for the period between January 1551 and November 1554, where he oversaw proposals for the redesigning of Rialto Bridge and the beginning of the works. He was renominated to the post with Gianbattista Grimani between October 1555 and October 1556 and continued to oversee the construction of the bridge. In the same year he was nominated superintended over works at the Ducal Palace, where he oversaw important works of reconstruction and redecoration, such as the repainting by Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Paolo Veronese of the ceiling of the room of the Council of Ten. He also led the council of fifteen patricians that oversaw the building of the Golden Staircase in the Ducal Palace. This frontal role in the management of artistic and cultural policy in Venice put Antonio Cappello at the centre of an important artistic network. Significant in this sense was the friendship that tied him to architect Michele Sanmicheli from their shared days in Legnago, and this brought him to commission to Michele Sanmicheli important works. Not only that, but two of Sanmicheli's artistic protégés, Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Paolo Veronese, received from him important commissions.A. Lotto, Aspetti della committenza veneziana in riferimento all'opera di Battista Zelotti tesi di dottorato di ricerca dell'università Ca' Foscari di Venezia (UNIVE), a.a. 2007-2008, p.44  Commissioning of the fresco cycle of Zelotti and Veronese at Ca’ Cappello  It is not surprising that a man who promoted the Republic's political advancement through a cultivated cultural policy thought to advance his own personal political career through artistic patronage. As such Antonio Cappello organized a substantial reorganization of the Gothic palazzo he inherited on the Grand Canal, Ca’ Cappello, that culminated with Giovanni Battista Zelotti and Veronese creating a large fresco-cycle with mythological scenes. The frescoes were damaged by fire and had worn out by the nineteenth century, but in his 1648 Carlo Ridolfi could still see them \\"above the Grand Canal in the house of the Cappelli [Veronese] coloured some figures of Cerere, Pomona, Pallas and other deities, while those above were coloured by his friend Zelotti\\".Ridolfi, C.

Musical In 2013 the performance was adapted into Necronomicon, a musical for Dramaten in Stockholm, Sweden. The music was rearranged for electronic music and used as the backbone for a storyline. The musical's storyline is a mix of The Music of Erich Zann, The Rats in the Walls, The Call of Cthulhu, \\"At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow Out of Time and The Thing on the Doorstep http://www.dramaten.se/PageFiles/.../neocronomicon_inspirationsmaterial.pdf The musical follows the young composer Edward Jr. is tasked with showing the archeologist Judith and her daughter Edith the newly opened mine that is owned by Edward's father. But soon they find themselves trapped in the cavern and they are not alone. They find most of the workers dead and are tormented by the insane worker Sebastian. Plot The audience is led into a dormitory in a mental ward. Edward Zann Jr. is sitting on a bed with bloody hands and a knife. Caretakers wearing masks appear and restrain him after he has hummed a strange melody. The Head Psychologist appears above the audience and follows the melody (The Music Of Erich Zann). The Head Psychologist invite the audience into the auditorium. The audience is led onto a stand. The Psychologists ask Edward Jr to tell them about what happened in the mine of Svartvatten (Black Water). Edward Jr. explains that his father Edward Zann owned a mine in his home town Svartvatten. During digging the workers found \\"strange geology\\" in the mine and Judith Grip, an old friend of Edward was sent after. Edward Jr, an aspiring composer, was supposed to meet up with them and lead them into the mine to meet up with Edward. Along with Judith came Edith, Edward Jr's childhood friend. Judith gives Edith the family pendant as she now is an adult. Edward Jr explains that his compositions came from dreams and strange melodies that came to him seemingly from nowhere. As the trio arrives in Svartvatten Edward is nowhere to be found and they decide to go look for him in the mine (The Mountains of Madness). The mine is seemingly abandoned and soon the elevator and one way out malfunctions, trapping them. The group discover unnatural stalagmites that have perfect surfaces like they were sculpted. One of them opens and a pulp of flesh drips out. They quickly realise that this is the remains of the workers. As they try to turn on the elevator the electricity goes out and the stage goes dark. Edward Jr runs alone in the darkness with only a small headlamp to light his way (and the stage). Suddenly a blonde, crazed and hulking worker appears and terrorizes Edward Jr with an insane rant about rats (The Rats in the Wall). As the light returns Edward recognises the worker as Sebastian. Sebastian is covered in blood and seemingly delighted by the chaos and horror. He rants about the Necronomicon. Edward Jr, Judith and Edith manage to subdue him and tie him up. They accuse him of killing the worker to which he neither denies or admits. When Edward Jr mentions the music Sebastian reveals he can hear it to and finds it beautiful. Sebastian says he found the Necronomicon in the mine and when he read is he learned the truth about everything and the Old Gods. He directs Edith to the book and she becomes enticed by it. When reading it she realises that the killing of the workers is part of a ritual to awaken the Old Gods and that they will destroy mankind when awakened (The Cult of Cthulu). As the group goes to sleep, Edward Jr remembers the serial killer, the Butcher, who haunted Svartvatten during their childhood (The Butcher). Sebastian frees himself but Edward appears with a gun too shot him. Sebastian flees but steals the Necronomicon. When Edward hears that Sebastian has found the lost Necronomicon which was the property of the Zanns for centuries he agrees that Sebastian is trying to awaken the Old Gods. Edward Jr goes away by himself and whispers to himself (Paranoid). Sebastian reads from the Necronomicon and throws himself onto a stalagmite which kills him. The whole mine shakes and eldritch symbols appear on the floor. Edith sinks into despair thinking Sebastian has succeeded with his plan (Haunter of the Dark). Edward Jr remembers a midsummer when he was a child (Subconscious Mind). Edward and Judith had discovered minerals in the local mountains allowing a mine to be opened. But soon after Judith's mother is found murdered by the Butcher. In the mine, Edith finds out that the ritual can be reversed by performing it again. Judith kills Edward to be the sacrifice and forces Edith to read from the Necronomicon. Sebastian suddenly awakens from the dead and attacks the group trying to prevent them from performing the ritual but they manage to kill him again. Edith reads from the book but group notices something is wrong. Suddenly Edith feels pain and falls to the ground. Her pendant is glowing and Judith reveals that she is in fact the consciousness of the Grips ancestral mother who through the pendant has passed on for centuries trying to awaken the Old Gods. Edward Jr stabs Judith but this is in fact how the transmission is concluded: he has killed Edith who is trapped in Judith's body. Sebastian actually tried to stop the awakening but was to insane after learning the truth that he could not tell. Judith burns the Necronomicon preventing the awakening from being stopped but Edward Jr stabs her to death thus robbing her of her prize: seeing and meeting the Gods. The stand is pulled back and the action returns to the hospital. Edward Jr sums up his story. The psychologists start to question his story, but not the fantastical elements. Instead they ask him how he could escape the mine and how he could be at the hospital if the Old Gods were unleashed? In a chilling twist the entire front story is revealed to be the actual delusion: Edward Jr. is still in the cave and the hospital scenario is a defense mechanism. As Edward wallows in his despair in the mine, above the Old Gods destroys all other life on the planet (Do You Know What's Wrong?).

The original standard gauge 52 mile line was built between Garrett and Midland Junction (also called Roberts) by the Houston and Texas Central Railroad in 1882. This original line was known as the Northeast Extension of the Houston and Texas Central. The line went bankrupt in 1885 and the Northeast Extension was sold at foreclosure on April 22, 1891 and became the Texas Central . This portion of the Texas Central was sold on October 27, 1892 to Hetty Green. Hetty Green sold the 52 mile railroad to the Texas Midland on January 27, 1893 and installed her son Edward Howland Robinson Green as President and General Manager. Headquarters city of the Texas Midland was Terrell, Texas. At start up the new company had five steam locomotives a 2-4-4, three 4-4-0s and a 4-6-0. Initial capitalization of the Texas Midland was $500,000. Over the next two decades Hetty Green invested some $1.8 million in the Texas Midland.  Betterments and Extensions  In 1894 a new 4-4-0 was purchased from Schenectady. A 19-mile extension was built from Roberts (just south of Quinlan) to Greenville in 1895. A new 4-4-0 was purchased from Baldwin in 1896. On September 1, 1896 trackage rights were granted by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway from Greenville to Commerce. A 38-mile extension was completed between Commerce and Paris in 1897. When the line to Paris was completed the Texas Midland had 125 route miles. Schenectady built three 4-4-0s and nine 4-6-0s for the Texas Midland in 1897. Two 2-8-0s were purchased from Alco in 1913. In 1921 the Texas Midland built its own 14 mile line between Greenville and Commerce. A 1923 report in Poor's Railroads showed the Texas Midland owned 16 locomotives, 16 passenger cars and 183 freight cars.  Traffic Base  The Texas Midland was part of a through route between St. Louis and Galveston. The line connected with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad at Paris and with the Houston and Texas Central at Ennis. A large portion of the freight traffic originated on the Texas Midland was cotton grown in the Blacklands region of East Texas.  Innovations  The Texas Midland placed its first all steel box car in service in 1900. The Texas Midland was the first railroad to use burnt gumbo as ballast. Texas Midland passenger equipment was the most luxurious in Texas. The Texas Midland operated the first café lounge and observation sleepers in the southwest. President Green cooperated with the federal government in developing a model demonstration cotton farm near Terrell. This model farm was in response to the Boll Weevil infestation of the cotton crop. The farm taught better cultivation and promoted new varieties of cotton. President Green paid his freight solicitors on commission rather than salary. This practice ended when not approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Sale of Property  The Texas Midland was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad on April 1, 1928. The Southern Pacific leased the Texas Midland to the Texas and New Orleans Railroad for operation. The Texas Midland was dissolved on June 30, 1934 when the Southern Pacific sold it to the Texas and New Orleans Railroad.  Abandonments  The new 14 mile line built between Greenville and Commerce was abandoned in 1933. Trackage rights were again established over the St. Louis Southwestern between those two points. Texas State Highway 224 now occupies a majority of this abandoned ROW between Greenville and Commerce. The line between Ennis and Kaufman was abandoned in 1942. The line between Kaufman and Greenville was abandoned in 1958. In 1971, floods on the North Sulphur (M.P. 110.77) and Jernigan (M.P. 95.52) Rivers washed out several miles of trackage on what was called the Paris Branch. Formal abandonment of this line was completed in 1975. A portion of track was left in place from Mile Post 86.79 (beginning of Paris Branch) in Commerce east to Mile Post 93.50 near Horton and utilized for car storage into the early 1980s. The rails were then removed east of Hunt County Road 4513 leaving a short stub in Commerce that was reconnected directly to the former St. Louis Southwestern C-branch main line track and is still utilized as a car storage track by the Blacklands Railroad.  Preservation  Some Texas Midland trackage remains in Commerce that is used by the Blacklands Railroad for freight car storage. Former Texas Midland trackage also exists in Ennis, Greenville, and Terrell as spurs serving local industry. Track is still down on a spur in Paris that led to the old compress. The Texas Midland Freight Depot remains in Commerce. The Texas Midland depot in Cooper is now the Patterson Memorial Delta County Museum.https://www.traveltexas.com/attractions/patterson-memorial-delta- county-museum The Texas Midland depot in Rosser is extant. Texas Midland passenger car #993 is preserved in Terrell. The Texas Midland freight depot is still standing in Terrell.

Helsinki: Otava, 1997. . Seppo Heikinheimo's father was the pianist Sakari Heikinheimo. Seppo begun his piano studies with Erik Tawaststjerna, and after the matriculation examination he studied musicology and classical philology at Helsinki University. He defended his Ph.D. thesis in 1972; the subject was the electronic music of Karlheinz Stockhausen.Otavan Iso Musiikkitietosanakirja 2, p. 571. Helsinki: Otava 1977. . Heikinheimo started his journalistic career in Uusi Suomi newspaper in 1959, first as a photographer and then as a writer. In 1963, recommended by Tawaststjerna, he moved on to Helsingin Sanomat and worked the rest of his life there as a music journalist.Tarkka, Pekka: \\"Seppo Heikinheimo.\\" (Necrology.) Helsingin Sanomat, 28 May 1997. On the top of that, he also worked as an intendant of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1970s. As a critic, Heikinheimo was harsh and sharp. He only knew excellence and inferiority; mediocrity was the worst he could think of. He used W. A. Mozart and Dmitri Shostakovich as yardsticks when evaluating musical accomplishments. In the 1960s Heikinheimo was an advocate of musical modernism and radicalism but later became very suspicious of contemporary music, alienating his former friends. In the early 1990s, Heikinheimo was active in starting the Mikkeli Festival. Heikinheimo had a summer villa near Mikkeli in the near the Lake Puula in Hirvensalmi. Heikinheimo's literary output as a writer, translator and editor was wide. He wrote three voluminous biographies, on Martti Talvela (1978), Aarre Merikanto (1985) and Oskar Merikanto (1995), and translated numerous works of fact and fiction into Finnish, including books by Roald Dahl, Maxim Gorky, Daniel Barenboim, Garri Kasparov, Yuri Lyubimov and others. Of special significance is his translation of the controversial Testimony by Dmitri Shostakovich which he made directly from the Russian-language manuscript. Heikinheimo is known to have used pen names \\"Antti Virtanen\\" ja \\"Raimo Ontronen\\".Sirén, Vesa: Heikinheimo, Seppo (1938–1997). Kansallisbiografia. (Requires subscription.) Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura. (6 September 2001.) A categorical and highly controversial person, Heikinheimo was proud of his Finnish fatherland and despised the Finland's Swedish language as the language of the occupiers. He was critical of the Soviet Union but was a friend of many Russian musicians like Vladimir Ashkenazy, Valery Gergiev, Sergey Musaelyan. For a short period of time, he was the chairman of Association of Finnish Culture and Identity.Laitinen, Kai: \\"Seppo Heikinheimo: Mätämunan muistelmat.\\" Helsingin Sanomat, 23 October 1997. The last vicissitudes of Heikinheimo's life were dramatic: he wrote his memoir but seemed to suffer from an unstable state of mind. After having sent the manuscript to his publisher Otava, Heikinheimo committed suicide in a hotel room in Helsinki. A couple of months later the book was published, with the uncompromising title Mätämunan muistelmat (roughly, “Memoirs of a Rotten Egg” or “Memoirs of a Pariah”). It is a book full of vivid and snarky anecdotes from home and abroad, spanning Heikinheimo's whole career, with 924 names in the personal index.Lång, Markus: “Heikinheimon varjossa.” Valitetut teokset: Esseitä ja arvosteluja 1991–2011, p. 363–366.

It was his debut novel under his own name.Weir wrote a novel before this called Theft of Pride under the pen-name \\"Jack Sharp\\" which was released on the web for free. It was originally self-published in 2011; Crown Publishing purchased the rights and re-released it in 2014. The story follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on Mars in 2035 \\"Ares 3 launched on July 7, 2035. They landed on Mars (Sol 1) on November 7, 2035. The story begins on Sol 6, which is November 12, 2035.\\" – Andy Weir and must improvise in order to survive. The Martian, a film adaptation directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon, was released in October 2015. Plot summary Mark Watney's route on Mars In 2035, the crew of NASA's Ares 3 mission have arrived at Acidalia Planitia for a planned month-long stay on Mars. After only six sols, an intense dust and wind storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which would trap them on the planet. During the hurried evacuation, an antenna tears loose and impales astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and engineer, also disabling his spacesuit radio. He is flung out of sight by the wind and presumed dead. As the MAV teeters dangerously, mission commander Melissa Lewis has no choice but to take off without completing the search for Watney. However, Watney is not dead. His injury proves relatively minor, but with no long-range radio, he cannot communicate with anyone. He must rely on his own resourcefulness to survive. He begins a log of his experiences. His philosophy is to \\"work the problem\\", solving each challenge in turn as it confronts him. With food a critical, though not immediate, problem, he begins growing potatoes in the crew's Martian habitat (the Hab), and burns hydrazine to generate water for the plants. NASA eventually discovers that Watney is alive when satellite images of the landing site show evidence of his activities; they begin devising ways to rescue him, but withhold the news of his survival from the rest of the Ares 3 crew, on their way back to Earth aboard the Hermes spacecraft, so as not to distract them. Watney plans to drive to Schiaparelli crater where the next mission, Ares 4, will land in four years and their MAV is already pre-positioned. He begins modifying one of the rovers for the journey, adding solar cells and an additional battery. He makes a three-week test drive to recover the unmanned Pathfinder lander and Sojourner rover and brings them back to the Hab, enabling him to contact NASA. Mitch Henderson, the Ares 3 flight director, convinces NASA Administrator Teddy Sanders to allow him to inform the Ares 3 crew of Watney's survival; they are thrilled, except for Lewis, who is guilt- stricken at leaving him behind. The canvas at one of the Hab airlocks tears due to Watney's repeated use of the same airlock, which was not designed for frequent and long-term usage. This results in the decompression of the Hab and nearly kills him. He repairs the Hab, but his plants are dead, threatening him again with eventual starvation. Setting aside safety protocols due to time constraints, NASA hastily prepares an unmanned probe to send Watney supplies, but the rocket disintegrates after liftoff. A deal with the China National Space Administration provides a ready booster—planned for use with the Taiyang Shen, an unmanned solar probe—to try again. With no time to build a probe with a soft-landing system, NASA is faced with the prospect of building a capsule whose cargo can survive crashing into the Martian surface at . However, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a \\"slingshot\\" trajectory around Earth for a gravity assist that could get Hermes back to Mars on a much-extended mission to save Watney, using the Chinese rocket booster to send a simpler resupply probe to Hermes as it passes Earth. Sanders vetoes the \\"Rich Purnell Maneuver\\", as it would entail risking the other crewmembers, but Henderson secretly emails the details to Hermes. All five of Watney's crewmates approve the plan. Once they begin the maneuver (having disabled the remote overrides), NASA has no choice but to support them. The resupply ship docks with Hermes successfully. Watney resumes modifying the rover because the new rescue plan requires him to lift off from Mars in the Ares 4 MAV. While working on the rover, Watney accidentally shorts out the electronics of Pathfinder, losing the ability to communicate with Earth (except for spelling out Morse code with rocks). After Watney leaves for Schiaparelli, NASA discovers that a dust storm is approaching his path, but has no way to warn him. The rover's solar cells will be less and less able to recharge, endangering both the rendezvous and his immediate survival (if there is not enough power to run his life-support equipment). While crossing Arabia Terra, Watney becomes aware of the darkening sky and improvises a rough measurement of the storm's shape and direction of movement, enabling him to go around it. Surviving a rover rollover on his descent into Schiaparelli, Watney reaches the MAV and reestablishes contact with NASA. He receives instructions on the radical modifications necessary to reduce the MAV's weight to enable it to intercept Hermes during its flyby. The modifications include removing the front of the MAV, which Watney has to cover with Hab canvas. After takeoff, the canvas tears, creating extra drag and leaving the MAV too low for the rendezvous. Lewis hastily improvises a plan to intercept the MAV by firing Hermes attitude thrusters and then blowing a hole in the front airlock with an improvised sugar-and-liquid-oxygen bomb, using the thrust from the escaping air to reduce speed. Beck, the Hermes EVA specialist, uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, MMU, on a tether to reach Watney and bring him back to Hermes. In a final log entry, Watney expresses his joy at being rescued, reflecting on the human instinct to help those in need. Main characters The major characters in the novel are: * Mark Watney: The titular \\"Martian\\" and main character; Ares 3 astrobotanist * Melissa Lewis: Commander of Ares 3 * Rick Martinez: Ares 3 pilot * Beth Johanssen: Ares 3 computer specialist * Alex Vogel: Ares 3 astrochemist * Dr. Chris Beck: Ares 3 Flight Surgeon and EVA specialist * Venkat Kapoor: Ares program manager * Mitch Henderson: Chief of astronaut corps * Bruce Ng: Director of JPL * Teddy Sanders: NASA Administrator (head of NASA) * Annie Montrose: NASA public relations chief * Mindy Park: NASA satellite imaging * Rich Purnell: NASA astrodynamicist Publishing history Author Andy Weir at Johnson Space Center, 2015 Andy Weir, the son of a particle physicist and electrical engineer, has a background in computer science. He began writing the book in 2009, researching related material so that it would be as realistic as possible and based on existing technology. Weir had previously used the concept of humans stranded on Mars in his webcomic Casey and Andy.Galactanet - The Creative Writings of Andy Weir, Casey and Andy Strip #125 Weir studied orbital mechanics, astronomy, and the history of human spaceflight. He said he knows the exact date of each day in the book. He specifically avoided physically describing the characters when not necessary for the plot. Having been rebuffed by literary agents when trying to get prior books published, Weir decided to put the book online in serial format one chapter at a time for free at his website. At the request of fans, he made an Amazon Kindle version available at 99 cents (the minimum allowable price he could set). The Kindle edition rose to the top of Amazon's list of best-selling science-fiction titles, where it sold 35,000 copies in three months, more than had been previously downloaded free. This garnered the attention of publishers: Podium Publishing, an audiobook publisher, signed for the audiobook rights in January 2013. Weir sold the print rights to Crown in March 2013 for over US$100,000. The book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list on March 2, 2014, in the hardcover fiction category at twelfth position and remained on this list for four weeks without going above eleventh position. The trade paperback edition of the novel debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list on November 16, 2014, in the paperback trade fiction category at eighth position. It gradually rose to the top position for the week of June 28, 2015, before dropping down to number two for nine weeks, during which it was displaced by E. L. James' Grey, before returning to the top position on September 6, 2015. The book remained continuously at the number one position for 12 weeks before it was displaced on November 22, 2015, by Nora Roberts' Stars of Fortune for two weeks. The trade paperback returned to the top position for the third and final time on December 6, 2015, for six weeks before it was finally replaced on January 24, 2016. The trade paperback's final appearance on the list occurred on April 24, 2016, 76 weeks after its debut in this category. Overall, the trade paperback edition was on the top of its New York Times best seller category for a total of 19 out of 76 weeks that the edition was listed. Editions The Martian was published in print by Crown on February 11, 2014. An audiobook edition, narrated by R. C. Bray and released by Podium Publishing, preceded the print release in March 2013 on Audible.com, and was later followed with an MP3 CD in association with Brilliance Audio. The audiobook was nominated and won an Audie Award (2014) in the Science Fiction category. A Classroom Edition, published by Broadway Books in May 2016, contains educational materials and removes profanity. Audible released a new audiobook edition, narrated by Wil Wheaton on January 1, 2020, featuring several additional short tie-in stories written by Weir. Tie-ins In 2015, Andy Weir wrote a prequel short story to The Martian, titled \\"Diary of an AssCan\\". A 2017 German publication of an interview with Andy Weir and survival tips for living on Mars was published, titled \\"Der Mars Survival Guide\\", tying in to the novel and movie. Reception In a starred review, Publishers Weekly said that \\"Weir laces the technical details with enough keen wit to satisfy hard science fiction fan and general reader alike.\\" Kirkus Reviews called The Martian \\"Sharp, funny and thrilling, with just the right amount of geekery\\". The Wall Street Journal called the book \\"the best pure sci-fi novel in years.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a grade of \\"B\\", describing it as \\"an impressively geeky debut novel\\" but saying Weir \\"stumbles with his secondary characters\\". USA Today rated The Martian three out of four stars, calling it \\"terrific stuff, a crackling good read\\" but noting that \\"Mark's unflappability, perhaps the book's biggest asset, is also its greatest weakness. He's a wiseacre with a tendency to steer well clear of existential matters.\\" Amazing Stories commented, \\"Andy Weir's The Martian will leave you as breathless as if you'd been dropped on the Martian surface without a suit\\". Awards and honors The Japanese translation of the novel won the Seiun Award for Best Translated Long Story in 2015. Solanum watneyi, a species of bush tomato from Australia, was named after the fictional botanist. It is a member of the same genus as the potato, Solanum. At the 2016 Hugo Awards, Andy Weir won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer for The Martian. The screenplay adapted from the novel additionally won Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form. Film adaptation In March 2013, Twentieth Century Fox optioned the film rights, and hired screenwriter Drew Goddard to adapt and direct the film. In May 2014, it was reported that Ridley Scott was in negotiations to direct an adaptation that would star Matt Damon as Mark Watney. On September 3, 2014, Jessica Chastain joined the film as Commander Lewis. The ensemble cast also includes Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film was released on October 2, 2015, and became the 8th-highest grossing film of the year.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2015 In popular culture On December 5, 2014, the Orion spacecraft took the cover page of The Martian script on the first test flight of the unmanned Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1). The script was launched atop a Delta IV Heavy on the flight lasting 4 hours and 24 minutes, landing at its target in the Pacific Ocean. In October 2015, NASA presented a new web tool to follow Watney's trek across Mars, and details of NASA's next steps, as well as a health hazards report, for a real-world human journey to Mars.

The larger fraction of Newton Leys lies within Milton Keynes and forms a part of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford civil parish. It is separated from central Bletchley, Water Eaton and the Lakes Estate by the West Coast Main Line. The remaining fraction of Newton Leys lies within the (former) Aylesbury Vale district and forms a part of the Stoke Hammond civil parish, although the village of Stoke Hammond is situated on the other side of the A4146 Newton Leys within Milton Keynes is a brownfield development and within the Buckinghamshire Council area is greenfield. The full district covers some and comprises development land with housing for up to 1650 homes with employment areas, shops, a school, community facilities, new park, hotel, a care home and leisure facilities built on two former brickworks and farmland. The site is being developed by Taylor Wimpey. Houses have been built at the development by Taylor Wimpey South Midlands, Taylor Wimpey North Thames, Persimmon, and Bovis Homes Group. The development area sits next to a man-made lake created from the brick making industry, a claypit was flooded to form Jubilee Lake, which has since become known as Willow Lake. The lakes at Newton Leys form part of a sustainable drainage system/balancing lake system designed to manage excess water caused by heavy or prolonged rainfall. Jubilee Brooks runs through the centre of the development, which rises north of Drayton Parslow and flows through the settlement towards the West Coast Mainline passing through to the Lakes Estate where it joins with the Water Eaton Brook, eventually flowing into the River Ouzel. Newton Leys is bordered by the A4146, the Bletchley Landfill Site operated by FCC Environment, Blue Lagoon Local Nature Reserve, Newton Longville and Stoke Hammond. The OxfordBletchley railway line runs along the northern border of the site, whilst the West Coast Main Line runs to the east of the site. History of the site The Bletchley area is rich in Oxford Clay, which has long been used for bricks. Brick-making has taken place on the Newton Leys site and the surrounding area from the late 19th century, circa 1897. The brickworks were named Newton Longville Brickworks and were made up of two sites - Jubilee Brickworks which was located on what is now the south of the Newton Leys site, and Bletchley Works which was in the northwest corner of the development site, adjacent to the OxfordBletchley railway line. Jubilee Brickworks closed in 1978 and has since been used as farming land for the adjacent Slad Farm. The lake formed by clay extraction at this site was used by anglers for many years and was known as Jubilee Pit The developer has since renamed it Willow Lake. Phase 1, 2 & 3 of the Newton Leys development is in this part of the site. Bletchley Brickworks closed in September 1990 and was planned to be used as landfill, initially by London Brick Landfill, a division of the brick-making company which owned the site, and was subsequently bought out by Shanks & McEwan. Permission was granted in 2002, and the landfill site has been operated since 2004 by FCC Environment. The original claypits (Fletton Pit, Water Eaton Pit) for the Bletchley Works closed in 1970 and have since become the Blue Lagoon Local Nature Reserve. In 1991, a plans to develop the unused parts of the brickworks and the adjoining farmland they owned at Slad Farm were created by The London Brick Company with input from Aylesbury Vale District Council, Buckinghamshire County Council, Milton Keynes Council, and Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Outline planning permission was granted in June 2006, and development is expected to be complete by 2021. Iron Age History Parts of the site have a history going back as far as the Iron Age, an archaeological evaluation commissioned by the developer in 2006, found an area of occupation in the floor of a stream valley in the southern part of the site, just west of Willow Lake. This comprised at least one circular enclosure interpreted as either a roundhouse or stock enclosure, and a series of ditches, gullies and small pits and postholes as well as several spreads of occupation deposits including a significant find of Iron Age pottery. Newton Longville Brickworks Newton Longville Brickworks were located on land between Bletchley and Newton Longville and were made up of two sites - Jubilee Brickworks and Bletchley Works. Brick-making started onsite circa 1890s and ceased within 100 years. As noted below, both works have been demolished and their sites subsequently redeveloped as Newton Leys. Nothing remains of the original structures. =Jubilee Brickworks= Jubilee Brickworks closed in 1978 and was mainly used as farming land for the adjacent Slad Farm. The lake formed in the claypit at this site was used by anglers for many years and was known as Jubilee Pit. The lake is now known as Willow Lake. =Bletchley Brickworks= Bletchley Brickworks closed in September 1990 and was proposed for reuse as landfill, initially by London Brick Landfill and subsequently by Shanks & McEwan. Permission was granted in 2002 and the site has been operated since 2004 by FCC Environment. The original claypits (Fletton Pit, Water Eaton Pit) for the Bletchley Works closed in 1970 and have since become the Blue Lagoon Local Nature Reserve.

Another painting of the same subject by Canaletto, Il Bucintoro al molo nel giorno dell'Ascensione (The Bucentaur at the Molo on Ascension Day), was purchased for £11.43 million by a mystery bidder at a Christie's auction in London on 6 July 2005.; . The Marriage of the Sea (), sometimes referred to as the Marriage of the Adriatic, was a ceremony which used to symbolize the maritime dominion of Venice. The ceremony, established in about 1000 AD to commemorate the Doge Pietro II Orseolo's conquest of Dalmatia, was originally one of supplication and placation, Ascension Day being chosen as that on which the doge set out on his expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by the doge's ship (from 1253 the Bucentaur), out to sea by the Lido port. A prayer was offered that \\"for us and all who sail thereon the sea may be calm and quiet\\", whereupon the doge and the others were solemnly aspersed with holy water, the rest of which was thrown into the sea while the priests chanted \\"Aspergēs mē hȳsōpō, et mundābor\\" (\\"Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be clean\\" – Psalm 51:7).The full verse appears in the New International Version of the Bible thus: \\"Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; / wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.\\" (Psalm 51:7.) To this ancient ceremony a quasi-sacramental character was given by Pope Alexander III in 1177, in return for the services rendered by Venice in the struggle against the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. The pope drew a ring from his finger and, giving it to the doge, bade him cast such a one into the sea each year on Ascension Day, and so wed the sea. Henceforth the ceremonial, instead of placatory and expiatory, became nuptial. Every year the doge dropped a consecrated ring into the sea, and with the Latin words \\"Desponsamus te, mare, in signum veri perpetuique dominii\\" (\\"We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination\\") declared Venice and the sea to be indissolubly one... Despite the end of the office of the doge and the destruction of the Bucentaur, the ceremony of the marriage of the sea continues to this day. It is performed by the mayor of Venice aboard a smaller ceremonial barge called the Bissona Serenissima.

Its principal activities are the organization of the International Conference of the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA), which was first held in 1980, and the publication of a journal, the Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts (JFA), which has been published regularly since 1990. Membership in the IAFA is open but almost all members are scholars, teachers, and graduate students in the field of Science fiction studies or Fantasy literature or Horror literature, or are authors.  The Conference  The International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) is held annually in the spring. The conference has been held in Orlando, Florida since 2008.

The conference was held on the FAU campus and was supported by a gift of operating funds provided by Margaret Gaines Swann, mother of the late FAU professor and fantasy author Dr. Thomas Burnett Swann. In the following years, the conference was held in Boca Raton, Florida, Beaumont and Houston, Texas, and in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, before settling in Orlando. The ICFA is organized into divisions by topic, which can change to reflect changing interests of the members. Current divisions include: fairy tales and folk narrative (added after the 2017 ICFA), fantasy literature, gothic and horror literature, the international fantastic, science fiction literature, visual and performing arts and audiences, film and television, and children's and young adult literature and art. Proposals for conference presentations are submitted to a specific division, which is selected by the proposer, for review by the appropriate division head. Anthologies of essays delivered at conferences from 1980 (published in the mid 80s) through 1994 have been called \\"the most comprehensive set of analyses of the fantastic in English.\\" As well as the presentation of research, the conference includes readings by invited authors, addresses by notable authors and scholars, workshops and social activities for students, and dramatic and sometimes humorous performances.

History Aspire Academy graduates in 2012 Aspire Academy was established by an Emiri Decree, No. 16 of 2004, as an independent government-funded agency that reported directly to the Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani through the Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani. Later, an Emiri Decree – No.1 of 2008 – incorporated the Aspire Academy as a strategic business unit (SBU) into the new, parent organization of Aspire Zone Foundation. Despite the switch from an independent government body to an SBU, the original purpose and objectives of the Aspire Academy remained the same. On 17 November 2005, the Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani led an opening ceremony of the Aspire Dome, essentially signaling the global announcement of Aspire Academy as an international institute of high standing. Over the years, it has received international recognition. Aspire own Spanish team Cultural Leonesa and Belgian team K.A.S. Eupen. In August 2017, Spanish side Atlético Astorga FC announced links with Aspire Academy. The link up saw some Aspire based players join the club. As of 3 January 2018, Aspire also have an official partnership with Leeds United in England. They also have a satellite academy in the African country of Senegal. In January 2019 and January 2020 the complex hosts the Match Premier Cup friendly tournament.  Achievements  Aerial view of the Aspire Dome and the academy's football pitches  Football  In 2014, the Qatar U-19 National Football Team, composed solely of past or current Aspire Academy student-athletes, won the 38th edition of the AFC U-19 Championship in Myanmar, for the first time in Qatar's history. With the same Aspire players, the senior side managed to conquer the nation's first ever AFC Asian Cup in 2019 edition.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/live-updates- japan-qatar-asian-cup-final-190201110503552.html  Athletics  * Mutaz Essa Barshim, Aspire Academy's graduate who specializes in high jump, has been the 2014 World Indoor Champion, and 2017 and 2019 World Champion, besides holding the Asian record and second best outdoor high jump in history set during the 2014 Diamond League. * Ashraf El Seify, athlete who specialized in hammer throw, graduated from Aspire Academy in 2014, won a gold medal at the 2012 Asian Junior Athletics Championships and 2012 World Junior Athletics Championships setting a new World Junior Record and World Youth Best. In 2014, Ashraf became the 1st athlete to successfully defend his title at the IAAF World Junior Championships. Controversies The Aspire Dome at night There have been several controversies regarding the academy. One such controversy is the allegation that Qatar bought votes to host the 2022 World Cup with the academy, with critics stating that Aspire sent scouts to Thailand and Guatemala, countries with little footballing history, due to both countries having representation on the FIFA Executive Committee. In addition, Paraguay, one of the countries with a recently opened program, is home to CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz. The statements were denied by Qatar. Most notably, there have been many allegations that Qatar plans to assimilate academy players into their 2022 World Cup squad. This is bolstered by Qatar's lenient policy on naturalization of athletes for sports.

Opera, October 2013 (Vol 64 No 10), . Life and career The Angas family were keen amateur musicians, and Richard, who was born in Esher in Greater London, became a chorister at the Royal School of Church Music as well as joining a local choral group.Richard Angas obituary by George Hall; The Guardian, 25 August 2013, accessed 16 February 2014 From 1960 until 1964 he studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and in 1965 won both the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship and the Richard Tauber Memorial Prize, before continuing his studies in 1965 and 1966 with Ilse Rapf and Erik Werba at the Vienna State Academy, and finally with Josephine Veasey.Adam, Nicky (ed). Angas, Richard. In: Who's Who in British Opera. Scolar Press, Aldershot, 1993. Angas's debut was as Lodovico in Otello for Scottish Opera in 1966. He sang the Abbot in Britten's Curlew River for English Opera Group in 1969. He first appeared with Welsh National Opera in 1976, and in 1980 began a 30-year association with English National Opera (ENO) where his roles included Pluto (L'Orfeo), Basilio (The Barber of Seville), Gloucester (Lear), Arkel (Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)), various roles in War and Peace, and the Mikado, which he sang over 150 times. He sang at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City with ENO on tour in 1984. He created roles in The Catiline Conspiracy (Hamilton, 1974), We Come to the River (Henze, 1975), The Mask of Orpheus (Birtwistle, 1986), Master and Margarita (Höller, 1989), Wagner Dream (Harvey, 2013), The Merchant of Venice (Tchaikowsky, 2013). Angas was particularly admired by director David Pountney, with whom he worked on notable productions such as Lulu, Wagner Dream and The Merchant of Venice (Tchaikowsky at the Bregenz Festival 2013). He sang Temrouk in the 1975 BBC broadcast of Ivan IV, and several roles in a rare 1983 transmission of Brian's The Tigers. Commercial records include a priest in Schoenberg's Moses und Aron conducted by Boulez in 1974, Simon Magus and Envy in The Pilgrim's Progress in 1971 under Boult, and the Cuisinière in The Love for Three Oranges under Denève in 2005.

He appeared on television as Sir Richard Cholmondely in The Yeomen of the Guard in 1975 and in a documentary on Venetian operas introduced by Raymond Leppard in 1973.Richard Angas filmography at BFI website, accessed 16 February 2014. The magazine Opera commented that \\"his gravelly yet vivid bass, great verbal acuity and 6'7\\" frame all contributed to an instantly recognizable stage presence\\", while The Guardian noted his \\"vocal presence ... immaculate diction and focused acting skills\\". Angas died in Leeds, where a concert celebrating his life and career was held at the Grand Theatre on 16 February 2014; it attracted thirty major singers and five conductors from several UK opera companies. Lesley Garrett, Susan Bullock and Jean Rigby sang the \\"Three Little Maids\\" from The Mikado, songs by Ireland and Schubert and Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music were performed, and there were readings by colleagues.Martin Dreyer.

Her present research interests include two separate but intersecting strains: Wittgenstein's approach to ethics, and the philosophy of addiction. She also contributes to public discourse about her areas of interest through contributing to popular media, especially around philosophical issues surrounding addiction, and has actively spoken out about issues of gender equity facing the field of philosophy. Education and career O'Connor earned her bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University in 1987, and her master's and doctorate in philosophy from the University of Minnesota in 1993 and 1996, respectively. Her doctoral thesis focused on Wittgensteinian moral realism. While pursuing her doctorate, O'Connor also acted as an instructor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota from 1994 to 1995, and an instructor of philosophy at Moorhead State University from 1995 to 1996. After completing her doctorate, O'Connor accepted a position as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus College from 1996 to 1999, before accepting a position as Assistant Professor of Women's Studies at Gustavus Adolphus. She was raised to Associate Professor in 2003, and to full Professor in 2007 in both Philosophy and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. O'Connor has also acted in several administrative capacities, including becoming Chairperson of the Department of Philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus in 2011, and serving as director of Gustavus Adolphus's Women's Studies Program from 1999 to 2004 and again from 2004 to 2011. Research areas O'Connor's present research interests include two separate but intersecting strains: Wittgenstein's approach to ethics, and the philosophy of addiction. She has also written extensively about issues involving gender equity and harassment, sexuality, abuse, and oppression. Publications O'Connor has published two books, and is working on a third. She has also edited a pair of books, contributed a number of book and encyclopedia chapters, and published a number of journal articles. O'Connor's first book, published in 2002, was titled Oppression and Responsibility: A Wittgensteinian Approach to Social Practices and Moral Theory, and drew on a primarily Wittgensteinian framework to articulate various forms of political oppression (focusing on forms she views as primarily invisible because their existence relies on rarely questioned assumptions,) and to put forward a theory of moral responsibility. Her second book, published in 2008, was titled Morality and Our Complicated Form of Life: Feminist Wittgensteinian Metaethics and opposed both realist and antirealist positions to metaethics, suggesting instead a Wittgensteinian approach that she refers to as “felted contextualism.” O'Connor's third book will explore issues of addiction and recovery through the lens of philosophy. In an interview on her book, she states: “Addicts are frequently very philosophical; we tend to be armchair thinkers. Addicts struggle with issues of self- identity, self-knowledge and self-deception, the nature of God, existential dilemmas, marking the line between appearance and reality, free will and voluntariness, and moral responsibility. These are prompted by acute instances of self-examination and reflection about how to live well.” O'Connor also maintains a blog on Psychology Today that deals with the philosophy of addiction, contributes to the New York Times' Opinionator and The Stone blogs about similar topics, and co-maintains the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article about topics in feminism.

It was provoked by poverty and hunger resulting from the abandonment of the controlled economy after dismantling of the Revolutionary Government during Thermidorian Reaction.  Causes  The abandonment of the controlled economy provoked a frightful economic catastrophe. Prices soared and the rate of exchange fell. The Republic was condemned to massive inflation and its currency was ruined. In Thermidor, Year III, assignats were worth less than 3 percent of their face value. Neither peasants nor merchants would accept anything but cash. The debacle was so swift that economic life seemed to come to standstill. The insurmountable obstacles raised by the premature reestablishment of economic freedom reduced the government to a state of extreme weakness. Lacking resources, it became almost incapable of administration, and the crisis generated troubles that nearly brought its collapse. The sans-cullots, who had unprotestingly permitted the Jacobins to be proscribed, began to regret the regime of the Year II, now that they themselves were without work and without bread. The Thermidorians accused the Montagnards of pushing them to revolt in desperation. On 17 March a delegation from faubourgs Saint-Marceau and Saint-Jacques complained that: «We are on the verge of regretting all the sacrifices that we have made for the Revolution». Police law was passed which lay down the death penalty for use of seditious language. Arms were distributed to the \\"good citizen\\", the faithful nucleus of the National Guard.  The insurrection  On 12 Germinal (1 April), the session of the Convention was interrupted by a crowd which invaded the chamber with cries of \\"Bread! Bread!\\" and created a prolong uproar. Vanheck, at the head of the Cite Section, imposed silence and demanded the application of the Constitution of 1793, measures to deal with the shortage of food, and the release of the imprisoned patriots. The demonstration finally allowed themselves to be persuaded, by the Montagnards themselves, to march past the bar and evacuate the chamber. In point of fact, it is impossible to talk of an insurrection organized by the sections; two of them, indeed, in respectful address, expressed themselves to the same effect as the Thermidorians. It is therefore obvious that the movement had no leaders worthy of the name, and that the agitators, launching forth into speeches, had been unable to reconstruct the bands which in the past had insured the success of the journees. The demonstrators were unarmed; they had repulsed the jeunesse doree easily, but when the National Guards of the western sections, led by Merlin de Thionville, appeared, they withdrew without offering any resistance. However, the city was seriously disturbed; the Pantheon and Cite sections declared themselves in permanent session; when Auguis and Penieres went to their headquarters, the former was arrested and wounded; a shot was fired at the latter. On the thirteenth, the agitation continued at the Quinze-Vingts.In the preceding night, the Convention had placed Paris under martial law and given command of the city to Pichegru, who happened to be there at the time, detailing Merlin de Thionville and Barras to assist him.  Reaction  The main consequence of the insurrection was to accelerate still further the political reaction. The Assembly immediately voted the deportation of Collot, Billaud, and Barere to Guiana. Eight prominent Montagnards were arrested including Amar, Leonard Bourdon, Cambon, René Levasseur, Maignet, Lecointre and Thuriot, who had been early leaders of the thermidorian reaction, was an indication of the extent to which the Assembly was now bent on undoing the past. The main weight of repression fell on the sans-cullots. A state of siege was declared in Paris and many of the germinal leaders were arrested. Under pressure from the Sections, the Assembly, on 10 April, ordered the disarming, in Paris and the provinces, of all who had played a leading part in Terror. It is estimated that only in Paris about 1,600 sans-culottes were affected by the measure. In the provinces the decree of 10 April was often the signal for the arrest and prosecution of former terrorists. In Lyons and the south-east it probably helped to set off the prison massacres for which it designated the victims.

This is possible because virtual machines (or processes) do not necessarily use as much memory at any one point as they are assigned, creating a buffer. If four virtual machines each have 1 GB of memory on a physical machine with 4 GB of memory, but those virtual machines are only using 500 MB, it is possible to create additional virtual machines that take advantage of the 500 MB each existing machine is leaving free. Memory swapping is then used to handle spikes in memory usage. The disadvantage of this approach is that memory swap files are slower to read from than 'actual' memory, which can lead to performance drops. While memory overcommitment is usually talked about in the context of virtualization, it is actually a generalised concept; Windows NT contained overcommitment features, as do most modern generalised operating systems, including the Linux kernel.

The name comes from the sound when the ball is being hit from one side to the next, pan - pon - pan - pon and is played on asphalt with racquets made of wood, a soft tennis ball and a net in form a wooden plank. Rules are similar to tennis or ping-pong but is played in shorter matches of 3 games.  History  The game was invented in 1922, during the Taisho era (1912-1926), on the Hitachi Ltd. factory campus in Japan. Pan-Pon was started as a lunch exercise, but has since has grown into a local sport in Ibaraki Prefecture. Tournaments within Hitachi plants, between plants, and among citizens in Ibaraki prefecture in Japan are organized. Outside Japan the sport is little known, but tournaments have been organized in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, United States, connected to the Hitachi Automotive plant there.  Rules = Court  Pan-pon is played on a rectangular flat court, normally outdoors on asphalt alternatively indoors on plastic floor. The court is 7 x 2.5 m with an inner serve area of 5.5 x 1 meter. The net is made of a 3-meter wooden plank, placed 40 cm above ground.  Equipment  Pans from the kitchen are made of wood, 30 x 20 cm and ca 10 mm in thickness. A simple ledge can be mounted on one of the short sides to make it easier to hold. The ball is an air-pumped rubber ball, size like a tennis ball (ca 70 mm diameter). If the ball is dropped from 1 meter altitude it should bounce back up 50–60 cm if it is correctly pumped.  The game  Before the match a coin is flipped to determine the first server. One of the players will serve to start the game and the serve is hit into the receivers inner serve area without touching the net/plank. The receiver will hit the ball back into the servers court side.  Scoring  A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. The game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total. If the score is 3-3 it is necessary to win by two points. At 4-4 it is enough to win by only one point.  Serve  The serve is alternated between the players, point by point. The server must stand behind the base line and between the side lines. The receiver can stand at any place in the court. It is not allowed to hit the serve with the racket above the waist. The server only has one attempt to make a successful serve. The receiver is not allowed to hit the ball before it has touched the ground.  Doubles  If team A meets team B, first player A1 will serve with B1 as receiver. In the following game B1 serves to A2, then A2 against B2, etc.  Nordic Pan-Pon Championships 2014  In connection with the Nordic Microscopy Meeting, Scandem 2014, in Linköping, Sweden, on June 9–13, 2014, the first Nordic championship in Pan-Pon will be held.

It stars Aaron Eckhart, Carice van Houten, Catalina Sandino Moreno, David Mazouz, Keir O'Donnell, Matt Nable, and John Pirruccello. The film was released on December 2, 2016, by Blumhouse Tilt and High Top Releasing. Plot An 11-year-old boy named Cameron Sparrow is attacked by a hooded stranger who tries to kill him. However, Cameron kills her instead and looks at the camera with red eyes, revealing that he is actually possessed by a demon named \\"Maggie.\\" Meanwhile, Dr. Seth Ember approaches a man named Henry in a club and makes him realize he is dreaming. Ember reveals that the woman Henry has been with is a demon who has possessed his body. The two escape and return to reality, and Henry is freed from the demon. In the waking world, Ember actually uses a wheelchair. Ember's assistant Oliver warns that the demons have started to adapt to Ember's efforts and that soon he may not be able to escape back to reality. Ember is approached by Camilla, a representative from the Vatican, who asks him to exorcise Cameron. Ember refuses, stating that his methods are not \\"exorcisms,\\" but Camilla reveals that the she believes the demon is one Ember knows. Ember visits a priest named Felix to question whether the demon could indeed be Maggie, which Felix affirms. Felix offers him a vial of blood from a possessed man which, when injected, would allow Ember about ten seconds of lucidity - just enough time to commit suicide, but he refuses. Ember meets the boy's mother Lindsay and explains that he does not exorcise demons but evicts them by entering their host's subconscious to make them realize they are dreaming. Demons do not have the power to truly control those they possess; instead, they lull their hosts into comforting dreams so they will be unaware while the demon uses their body. He visits the possessed Cameron and the demon recognizes him. Ember, Oliver, and, the third member of their team, Riley prepare for the eviction. Riley explains that by entering a near-death state, Ember will be able to synchronize his brain frequencies to Cameron's and enter his subconscious. However in this state, Ember has only about eight minutes before his heart will give out. Ember enters Cameron's dream and sees him with his father, Dan, but has a seizure and has to be pulled out of the dream to be revived. Ember demands that Dan be present to help evict the demon. Lindsay refuses, explaining that the couple separated after Dan broke Cameron's arm in a drunken rage, but she agrees when Ember insists that Cameron's father might be the only way to save Cameron. Dan's presence initially seems to help, but Maggie lashes out at him. Ember pleads with Maggie to release Dan since Ember is the one Maggie wants. The demon does so but Dan dies from his injuries. Lindsay, alarmed, demands to know Ember's history with the demon. Ember reveals he discovered that he had the power to perform astral projection and enter the dreams of other people, but hid his power to live a normal life. However, this made him a target for demons. One day, while driving with his wife and child, the three were hit by a car driven by a possessed driver. The attack left Ember's family dead and is the reason that he needs to use a wheelchair, and ever since, he's been hunting the demon \\"Maggie,\\" whom he named after the woman it had possessed. Ember visits Felix to acquire the blood vial but discovers that Felix has been possessed. Felix attacks Ember and commits suicide. Returning to Cameron's dream, Ember uses a ring Cameron had received as a gift from his real father to make the boy realize he is in an illusion. The pair flee from Maggie, and Ember helps Cameron escape. Ember and Cameron wake up, but Ember wakes up again in a hospital with his wife and son. He realizes he's now inside his own dream and begs Maggie to release Cameron and take him instead, to which the demon agrees. However, when Cameron wakes up, Riley administers the blood and Ember uses his ten seconds to fling himself from the apartment balcony. As he dies, Riley warns everybody not to touch Ember's body. Paramedics attempt to resuscitate Ember, joined by Camilla. They succeed in getting a heartbeat, allowing Maggie to possess Camilla, before Ember dies.

Blalock graduated from the University of Montevallo and studied social work at the University of Chicago. She returned to Alabama and worked for the State Department of Education and Rehabilitation, where she helped establish clinics for children with birth defects and other illnesses. She was director of the Selma-Dallas County Public library for 27 years, where she was instrumental in integrating the institution during the 1960s, and retired in 1988.Selby, M. (2012). Librarians as Leaders. Feliciter, 58(5), 37-38. Early life Patricia Blalock was born on May 9, 1914 in Gadsden, Alabama. She had two siblings, a sister, Irene, and a brother, James. Her parents were \\"racially moderates,\\" and more liberal than most families in her area. Her grandfather was one of the first members of the Populist Party in the area and had taught her \\"not to fear blacks.\\" She attended the University of Montevallo in Montevallo, Alabama and received a master's degree in social work from the University of Chicago. In 1937, she moved to Selma, Alabama where she became the district supervisor of the State Crippled Children’s Services and oversaw the work of the agency in 28 counties. Blalock got married and had a daughter in 1946, after which she retired from social work.Graham, P.T. (2002.) A Right to Read: Segregation and Civil Rights In Alabama's Public Libraries, 1900-1965. Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama Press. Desegregating the Dallas County Public Library in Selma In 1951, \\"Miss Betty\\" asked Blalock to work in the Dallas County Public Library in Selma, Alabama, on a part-time basis. Blalock began working as an assistant for the library, a position she held for nearly ten years. When the library director became ill, Blalock became temporary director. The library board then asked her to become the permanent director when it was clear that the current director would not be able to continue. Blalock was apprehensive at first because she did not have a library degree but was, instead, a social worker. The board expressed their faith in her and asked that she take the position which she assumed in 1963. At the time, there was only one library in Selma. The Selma Library began in 1904 with a $10,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie, who wanted to provide libraries to small communities. Unlike other segregated southern communities which provided a branch for black patrons, Selma’s minority population was served through the back door of the library by the library maid. At the time Blalock assumed her official role as the director, Selma was being informally, but influentially, run by the White Citizens' Council. Created in 1955 in response to the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education, the White Citizen’s Council sought to keep the status quo of white supremacy in city life and community affairs. Two influential ex officio members of the library board who attended board meetings regularly were Mayor Chris Heinz and Judge Bernard Reynolds, both leaders in the Citizen’s Council. Both orthodox segregationists, Heinz and Reynolds wanted to protect Selma’s way of life from people who they considered \\"outside agitators.\\"Carmichael Jr., J. V. (2005). Southern Librarianship and the Culture of Resentment. Libraries & Culture, 40(3), 324-352. Blalock, upon becoming library director, immediately pushed for desegregation of the library with the library board. This was a difficult task, especially during the political climate of the 1960s, but Blalock was persistent. She personally visited each board member in order to try to convince them that desegregation was inevitable. Blalock had used recent integration orders by the federal government in Montgomery and protests in Birmingham as examples of trouble the people of Selma could expect. She argued that Selma could take control of its own integration process rather than have outsiders do it for them. By May 1963, Blalock had become more urgent in her appeals. She told Board that there was a push to protest the library’s segregation policies and that she was unsure if she would even be able to open the library on Monday without some sort of desegregation plan in place. The Board agreed to meet at Blalock’s home that morning to work out a plan.Graham, P.T. (2002). A Right to Read: Segregation and Civil Rights In Alabama's Public Libraries, 1900-1965. Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama Press. The original Selma Public Library which was built with a Carnegie library grant. The desegregation plan that was developed for the Selma-Dallas County Library was not ideal to Blalock, but it did accomplish the goal she so eagerly sought. It was decided that the library would remain closed for one week, from May 13 to May 19. Following that period, it would reopen using \\"vertical integration\\" techniques; all of the chairs in the library would be removed in order to keep black and white patrons from sitting together. In addition, the library's desegregation would not be publicly announced and all library card applicants would be required to provide two references, a negligible impediment in the mind of Blalock.Plotnik, A. (1973). Library life in the Deep South. Wilson Library Bulletin, 47,784-785. On May 20, 1963, the library reopened, fully desegregated, without much fanfare. Library visitors who found the lack of chairs unusual were told that the chairs were in the basement being stored temporarily. Black patrons, unaware of the recent change, were slow to use the library at first; by November, they were becoming more common. Blalock slowly began taking the chairs out of storage and moved them back to the library. With the library desegregated, Blalock also pushed for integration of the library staff. Annie Molette, the library maid who quietly used her position to provide library services to the community’s blacks through the back door, was told by Blalock that the library would be hiring a new maid. Molette was then told that she was being hired as Selma’s first African-American library assistant. Desegregation of the library was not universally accepted by Selma’s white community; the skills Blalock learned as a social worker became indispensable in her service to all members of the community in order to keep the city calm on the issue. An anecdote tells of a white library patron who, upon seeing African-American patrons using the library, tore up his library card in anger and vowed never to return. Two weeks later when the man returned to check out a book, he was met by Blalock who had earlier taken the time to tape back together the pieces of his card and save it in case he did return. Later life and recognition In 1988, Blalock retired from her role as director of the Selma-Dallas County Public Library. In 1992, Blalock was recognized by the Alabama Library Association with its Distinguished Service Award. This award recognizes an individual who has made a significant contribution towards the development of library services in the State of Alabama.

March 30, 1937. P. 2. Blondie Boston Blackie and The Passing Parade.\\"The Passing Parade\\" (review). The Billboard. July 31, 1943. P. 12. Wilcox came from a show business-oriented family, with a father who played in the Ringling Brothers circus band and a sister who played violin both in vaudeville and in classical concerts. Harlow took vocal lessons and briefly performed on stage. He eventually decided to try radio and met Jim and Marian Jordan at a station in Chicago. An April 1944 article in Radio Mirror magazine reported: > Jim and Marion [sic] Jordan were just getting a toehold in radio in Chicago > then and Wilcox helped them cut some records. When the pair landed their own > radio show, they asked for Wilcox as their announcer. The future triumphs of > the trio are well known to all Fibber McGee and Molly fans. When the Jordans > moved out to Hollywood in 1939, Wilcox went with them and now, even when > Fibber McGee and Molly leave the air for their annual summer vacations on > their ranch, Wilcox carries on, announcing the sponsor's substitute show. Wilcox became \\"one of the most successful announcers and pitchmen in radio.\\" He was the announcer for Fibber McGee and Molly (his first network program) throughout the show's run in a 30-minute format. He also was a pioneer in making commercials a part of a program's story rather than something simply inserted during a break. The \\"Wistful Vista\\" website put it this way: > Wilcox was one of the masters of the integrated commercial, a technique that > was popularized on Ed Wynn's and Jack Benny's shows. Instead of stopping the > story for the mid-show commercial, Wilcox would just show up and work his > plug into the plot, much to Fibber's consternation. Fibber tagged Wilcox > with the nickname \\"Waxy\\" for his ability to turn any conversation topic to > Johnson's Wax ... An article in a Smithsonian Institution newsletter described Wilcox's role in integrating commercials into stories as follows: > A standard joke on the popular comedy Fibber McGee and Molly was the arrival > of Johnson's Wax salesman Harlow Wilcox. He knocked at their door as just > another person in their stream of visitors, but no matter what the > conversation had been about before his arrival, Wilcox somehow managed to > turn it to floor wax within a few moments, and then struggled to promote his > product over the continuing action around him.\\"HELLO, AMERICA!: Radio > Broadcasting in the Years Before Television.\\" Art to Zoo: News for Schools > from the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Elementary and Secondary > Education. Fall 1986. P. 2. As was generally true of radio personalities, most people's impressions of Harlow Wilcox came solely from hearing him on the air. One writer, however, recorded her perceptions as a member of the studio audience at the Fibber McGee and Molly broadcast Dec. 5, 1946. In her \\"By-ways\\" column, Florence Burlingame Taylor wrote: > Harlowe [sic] Wilcox was introduced as a young lad, just getting a start in > radio. This was before Harlowe appeared, and Fibber had us believing that > Harlowe was ill. How we applauded the popular Harlowe! He is a handsome, > debonair man-about-town -- at least 40, gray-haired, with crisp gray > mustache, tall, with all the poise of a veteran announcer. In addition to his announcing roles, Wilcox also acted in an episode of the TV version of You Are There and in two movies, Look Who's Laughing and They're Off. Wilcox can be heard on a 1937 promotional film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB_JsoNb8PY&t;=203s for Stewart-Warner refrigerators which was preserved by the Library of Congress, and which also includes an appearance by 18-year-old Art Carney. In the 1950s, Wilcox was executive vice president of Rockett Pictures, Inc., a film production company in Hollywood, California.

During its existence, it operated alongside Coast Guard Air Station Dinner Key. History Dinner Key was the site of the first continental naval air station in the United States, which opened in 1918. The United States Navy vacated the facility following the end of World War I that year, and it was then used by commercial seaplane operators. The New York, Rio & Buenos Aires Airline began service at the airport in 1929 and merged into Pan Am in 1930. Dinner Key served as a base for Pan American World Airways's flying boats during the 1930s and 1940s. It was one of the world's largest airports and the main hub for air traffic between North and South America. The inaugural flight from Dinner Key to Panama took place on December 1, 1930. Charles Lindbergh, who was a technical adviser to Pan Am, surveyed some of the early air routes. Because of inadequate landing facilities along the South American route, flying clipper ships were utilized by Pan Am, forming a vital link between North and South America. Pan Am opened an Art Deco terminal building at the airport in 1934, featuring a globe in its lobby that was 10 feet in diameter and weighed 3.5 tons. Pan Am operated Sikorsky S-41 and Sikorsky S-42 flying boats from the airport. The Navy requisitioned the entire Dinner Key facility in 1943 and commissioned it as Dinner Key NAF. After the technological advances of World War II and the construction of suitable airports in South America made seaplanes largely obsolete, Pan Am transferred its operations to Miami International Airport, which had been in operation since 1928 as Pan American Field. Pan Am's final flight to Dinner Key took place August 9, 1945. Today, the airport is the site of Miami City Hall, located in the old Pan Am terminal building. Two of Pan Am's hangars are still in use by the Grove Key Marina.

It is located about north of the city centre of Namur just off the old Gembloux-Namur (N904 road) at the top of the steep northern valley slope of the River Meuse. It is in the province of Namur in Wallonia (one of the three regions of Belgium). Etymology and geography The name of the Château is derived from the Latin word Falise (Cliff, French:falaise) because of its position close to the top edge of a steep declivity of the valley sides of the River Meuse at the foot of which is city of Namur. Just south west of the Château the steep side of the Muese valley is cut by the Houyoux, a tributary of the Meuse, which has created a smaller valley in the steep declivity of the Muse valley. The Houyoux is used by the land transport routes from Gembloux and Namur, to descend into the Meuse valley from the plain above. History In 1638, King Philip IV of Spain, leased this manor in 1638 to Gilles I of Glymes, Lord of La Falize, for the sum of 1500 florins. Honore de Glymes-Brabant, son of Ignace-François de Glymes-Brabant, Lord of la Falize built most of the current structure in 1757.

Ford initially manufactured fully assembled cars in Detroit and then \\"knocked them down\\" (took off the wheels and otherwise prepared them for shipment) and shipped them to dealers. The agents in distant cities reassembled the knocked-down cars before sale. To better serve the network of sales dealerships.

Afterwards, it has become the pioneer in the replacement of the African enslaved by the European immigrants' labour and in the use of the steam engine, cart and plough. The Ibicaba has also served as a military headquarters during the War of the Triple Alliance, receiving the Emperor Dom Pedro II, the princess Isabel and the count Gaston of Eu. In the 19th century, it was the stage to the revolt of the European immigrants, led by Thomaz Davatz, who achieved to show the European authorities the conditions in which their former citizens lived in Brazil. By 1882, the Italian immigration to Brazil grew significantly, encouraging the aftermost massive immigrations of Italians to the whole state of São Paulo, including its capital. In 1890, the farm was bought by the Levy family, and then reduced thanks to the allotment and inheritance conditions. Since the 1990s, it's being used as a museum and tourist site.

A building was erected on the site in the late medieval period. Name and location Dun an Sticir () is located on a small island in Loch an Sticir on the east side of the B893 road, 0.8 kilometers south of Newtonferry.M. Coventry (2006), The Castles of Scotland, p. 266. Fourth Edition, Birlinn Limited. The name is also misspelled Dun an Sticer and Dun an Sticar. The island, on which the broch stands, is connected by a causeway to another larger island called Eilean na Mi-Chomhairle (Island of Bad Council). This larger island is connected via two causeways to the mainland. Dun an Sticir is freely accessible. At high tide, the causeways may be partially submerged. The name Dun an Sticir is derived from \\"dun\\", which means \\"fortress\\", and \\"sticir\\" which means \\"skulker\\". Thus Dun an Sticir means Fort Skulker. Only in the second half of the twentieth century did it become clear that the structure was a broch.I. Armit (2003), Towers in the North - The Brochs of Scotland, pp. 138-139. Tempus Publishing Ltd . History Dun an Sticir was probably built in the Iron Age in the period between 100 BC and 100 AD, like most brochs. Limited excavations resulted in finds of pottery. The broch was probably inhabited during the Viking period.A. Badcock (ed.), (2008) Ancient Uists. Exploring the archaeology of the Outer Hebrides. pp. 52-53. Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar. In the Middle Ages the broch was converted into a rectangular hall, or small tower. The entrance was enlarged and a window was constructed. Outbuildings were added and there was a larger building on Eilean na Mi- Chomhairle. The causeway from the north side of the loch to Eilean na Mi- Chomhairle was widened to 3 meters, so that carts could get to the island. Hugh MacDonald of Sleat (), son of Hugh the Clerk,According to the Site Record of the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland the son of Archibald the Clerk. inhabited Dun Sticir in 1602. He was the Factor to North Uist in the 1580s. In 1586 he hatched a plan to murder his cousin, Donald Gorm, 8th Chief of the Macdonalds of Sleat. After his plan was discovered, he fled to Dun an Sticir. He was eventually captured when he tried to escape a siege of his castle, Caisteal Uisdean, on Skye.O. Swire (1999), Skye. The island and its legends. pp. 52-53. Third Edition Maclean Press. As punishment, he was starved to death in the dungeon of Duntulm Castle on Skye. Construction Medieval building within Dun an Sticir Dun an Sticir is located on an island in a loch. A wide stone causeway leads from the north to the island of Eilean na Mi-Chomhairle. A second, smaller causeway leads from the south side of the lake to the same island. A third causeway curves from that island to the east to the small island on which the broch lies. The causeways are partially submerged at high tide. The broch has a total diameter of 18 metres. The walls of the broch are 3.5 metres thick and in some places a little more than three metres high. The circular interior of the broch was in the Middle Ages transformed into a rectangular area 10 metres by 4.6 metres. The axis is northeast-southwest. The entrances are 1.1 metres wide, located in the northwest and southwest of the rectangular space. The wall at the southwestern entrance is 2.5 metres thick.

The interior decoration was simple yet elegant, showcasing the Victorian taste for artificiality, and was built in the early 19th century by George Washington Alston and his wife, Marina Priscilla Williams. Operated by the Cherry Hill Historical Foundation, the plantation now hosts concerts, performances, weddings, and other social functions. The house is located one hour away from the state capital, Raleigh. __TOC__ History George Washington Alston (1801–1849) and his wife, Marine Williams Alston (1810–1897) lived at Old Cherry Hill, an early Alston home located several hundred yards behind the present house. Their three children, William, Philip, and George were all born at Old Cherry Hill and were still young boys at the time of their father's death. George and Marina had planned to build a new home, but these plans were interrupted by his death. After he became aware of his failing health, John Buxton Williams, whom he had made guardian of the three boys, proceeded with the building of the house. Cherry Hill Plantation was built by John Waddell in 1858. Waddell was named the master builder of the plantation after Jacob Holt entrusted him with the responsibility of the task. When George Washington Alston died, he left the plantation to his wife. The Alston family also shared connections to several other large landowners. Marina Priscilla Williams commissioned the construction of the present building. The owners of this plantation were associated with other plantations in Warren County, Myrtle Lawn and Tusculum. They were also associated with the Linwood Farms, Rocky Hill, and Vine Hill Plantations in Franklin County. During the time of the construction, there were ninety slaves on the estate with fourteen slave houses. The plantation consisted of 500 acres of improved land and 1500 acres unimproved, used for timber, grazing, etc. Architecture There is a low fence around the house, and octagonal gazebos in the two corners of the front yard. There is an ice-house just north of the fence, and an octagonal well house with lattice walls just west of the back fence. Amethyst, the fine gem, can be found underneath the Cherry Hill home. John A. Waddell used the skills he learned from the Holt school when he was building Cherry Hill. He incorporated Holt's blending of new and ornate Italianate and Gothic Revival styles with the traditional Greek Revival into the home design. A trefoil theme was used to model the porch, creating an ogee arch. The doors are painted to resemble various woods, such as rosewood and the baseboards are made to resemble gray or black marble. The interior decoration was simple but elegant, showcasing the Victorian taste for artificiality The piano for the composer or pianist to play was placed in the front hall, and the first thing visitors see upon entering the house. The front hall was designed using the axil plan: having one central hall and two equal-size rooms on both sides. The rooms were used for extra seating for concert listeners. There are two staircases within the house as well. The staircase on the northern side of the plantation was built for women who wore hooped dresses as well as serving as extra seating during concerts. The second staircase is located at the south side of the house and was used mostly by men. The guest composers would spend the night upstairs in the north bedroom the night before their concert. The south-end bedroom was used primarily for the children to stay in. The master bedroom, where Marina Alston slept, is located downstairs. A unique feature is the two closets built inside the room, as many homes during that time did not have a closet inside of the rooms. The building was structured to highlight the supreme southern hospitality. Concert theater Concerts were not played at Cherry Hill until Edgar Thorne came along. Edgar Thorne began buying out the other owners of the property in the 1960s. He deeded the house and 14 acres of the property to the Cherry Hill Historical Foundation in 1982 and continued to live there with his sister until her death in 1998, establishing the Cherry Hill Concert Series and caring for the house. The plantation soon became well known for its outstanding concerts. Three concerts were held in the fall and three in the spring due to the lack of central heating and air conditioning . Guests could sit in the same room as the composer, or in either of the two rooms that were close to the composer. Many of them also sat on the first stairwell of the house, and if there were several guests, they sat on the opposite stairwell. The composers consisted of pianists and violinists. The grand piano that now sits in the front of the house was put there in 2001, replacing the Steinway Grand that was previously there. Edgar Thorne died in 2004. It was his dream that the Cherry Hill Historical Foundation continue the classical concert series that he and his sister began in the 1970s. Today, Cherry Hill holds concerts throughout the year except during the summer unless it is a special occasion. Each concert averages between 35-60 guests during each concert. The concepts and design that Edgar Thorne had are still the same, keeping everything as original as possible.

His observations, research and calculations were compiled into the book called Siddhanta Darpana, which has verses written in Sanskrit and Odia script. He earned the Mahamahopadhyaya award in 1893. Biography Samanta was born in the Princely state of Khandapada in Nayagarh district in the Indian state of Odisha. He was the son of Samanta Syamabandhu Singha and Bishnumali Devi. He was born into a royal family. He studied Sanskrit and researched traditional Indian astronomy. During his youth, Samanta measured the length of the shadows throughout the day by using bamboo and wood to create measuring instruments he called mana yantra. He also measured time by using his own version of a sundial. Samanta suffered from insomnia throughout his life and died on June 11, 1904, from fever & infection.  Instrument maker  Samanta was self- taught by the age of 15 after reading the books available at the Royal Library. During his research, Samanta designed many of his instruments by using everyday materials such as wooden sticks and bamboo. After studying mathematics and traditional astronomy, he used his knowledge to match predictions made by ancient Indian mathematicians and astronomers such as Aryabhata, Varahamihira, and Brhamagupta. He carried out research in measurements using only a bamboo pipe and two wooden sticks. His findings were recorded in his book titled Siddhanta Darpan and were mentioned in the European and American press in 1899. Samanta’s calculations were eventually used in the preparation of almanacs in Odisha.

During a racing career which lasted from May 2001 until December 2009 he won eleven of his forty-six races (including Grade I victories in three countries) and was placed on nineteen occasions. He showed some promise in his early career but emerged as a top- class performer in 2004 when he won the Royal & SunAlliance Chase at Cheltenham Racecourse in England and the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil at Auteuil Hippodrome in France. In the following year he won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Leopardstown Racecourse in Ireland. After his career in National Hunt races was ended by injury he had some success on the amateur Point-to-point circuit. Background Rule Supreme is a bay gelding bred in Ireland by Mary and H T Murphy. He was sired by Supreme Leader, a high-class flat racer who won the Earl of Sefton Stakes and the Westbury Stakes as well as finishing third in the 2000 Guineas and fourth in The Derby. He later became a very successful sire of National Hunt performers including Keen Leader (Reynoldstown Novices' Chase), Fundalentalist (Royal & SunAlliance Chase), Fota Island (Grand Annual Chase), What's Up Boys (Coral Cup), Pettifour (Sefton Novices' Hurdle) and Supreme Glory (Welsh Grand National). Rule Supreme's dam, Book of Rules, was an unraced mare who produced at least two other winners. As a three-year-old in June 1999, Rule Supreme was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sales where he was bought for 57,000 guineas by John Lynch. The gelding was sent into training with Pat Hughes at Bagenalstown, County Carlow. Racing career=2001/2002 National Hunt season: Novice Hurdles Rule Supreme began his racing career by finishing third in a novice hurdle race at Wexford Racecourse on 4 May 2001 in which he finished third of the fifteen runners. He returned in autumn, and was unplaced in races at Gowran Park and Down Royal before showing improved form to finish second at Navan and Punchestown. On 29 December he started 11/4 favourite for a maiden hurdle over two and a half miles at Leopardstown Racecourse. Ridden by Charlie Swan he led from the start and recorded his first victory as he won by ten lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. Rule Supreme returned in March to finish second in novice events at Punchestown and Fairyhouse: in the latter event he was beaten five lengths by the subsequent Grade I winner Davenport Milenium. The gelding returned to Fairyhouse on 17 April for a two and a half mile novice hurdle and started 4/6 favourite against nine opponents. Ridden again by Swan, he led for most of the way and held off the challenge of Four Aces to win by a length. He ended his season ten days later by finishing fourth over three miles at Punchestown. 2002/2003 National Hunt season: Novice Chases For the 2002/2003 season Rule Supreme was transferred to the stable of Willie Mullins and was campaigned in novice steeplechases. He made only two appearances, finishing a close fourth at Leopardstown in January and fifth, beaten thirty lengths by Adamant Approach at Cork Racecourse in April. 2003/2004 National Hunt season Having failed to win two starts in early 2003, Rule Supreme was still eligible for novice chases in the 2003/2004 season which began in April. At the end of that month he carried 161 pounds in handicap race for novices over three miles and a furlong at Punchestown. Ridden by David Casey made steady progress over the last six fences before overtaking his better-fancied stable companion Hedgehunter in the closing stages and winning by three and a half lengths. In the last race of his spring campaign, Rule Supreme started 4/7 favourite at Gowran Park but fell at the eighth fence when in third place. After a break of more than six months, Rule Supreme returned at Thurles Racecourse in December when he won the Glen Chase, beating more experienced rivals by four lengths when ridden by Ruby Walsh. Three weeks later he was moved up in class when he was sent to England for the Grade I Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse. Ridden by A. P. McCoy, he lost touch with the leaders in the closing stages and was the last of the three finishers behind the Paul Nicholls-trained favourite Strong Flow. In the early part of 2004, the gelding was again campaigned in handicap company and ran well without winning, finishing third when attempting to conceded eleven pounds to Hedgehunter at Gowran Park and second when conceding thirty pounds to Coq Hardi Diamond in the Grand National Trial at Punchestown. Rule Supreme was sent to England for the second time to contest the Grade I Royal & SunAlliance Chase on 17 March at the Cheltenham Festival. He was ridden by Casey and started a 25/1 outsider for a race whose leading contenders appeared to be Our Vic (winner of the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase), Pizarro (Champion Bumper) and Royal Emperor (Towton Novices' Chase). Rule Supreme did not jump well and was towards the rear of the field for most of the way, but began to make progress approaching the second last fence where Mossy Green fell and brought down Pizarro. He overtook Old Vic after the last fence and held off a challenge from Royal Emperor to win by one and a quarter lengths. After the race Mullins said \\"He'll probably go to Punchestown and then possibly the French Champion Hurdle, then next year we might seriously consider the Stayers' Hurdle. The ability is there for a Gold Cup, but probably not the scope for it with his jumping. He's got a tremendous engine, but is a scrappy jumper\\". Rule Supreme returned to England again in April, unseating Casey when he made a bad jumping mistake in the Mildmay Novices' Chase at Aintree, and finishing fifth when carrying 164 pounds in the Betfred Gold Cup at Sandown Park on the last day of the season. Four days after his defeat at Sandown, Rule Supreme started a 20/1 outsider and finished fifth of the six runners behind Beef or Salmon in the Grade I Punchestown Gold Cup. The National Hunt season in Britain and Ireland then went into the summer break, but Rule Supreme remained active and was sent to race in France. On 30 May he was ridden by Casey and started a 41/1 outsider for the Grade II Prix La Barka over 4300 metres at Auteuil Hippodrome. Racing on very soft ground, he took the lead two hurdles from the finish and kept on after being overtaken to finish third behind Great Love and Nickname. Three weeks later he faced Great Love and Nickname again, as well as the leading steeplechasers Kotkijet and Batman Senora in France's most important hurdle race, the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil over 5100 metres. Casey restrained the gelding towards the back of the seven runner field before moving up to dispute the lead three hurdles from the finish. He took the lead 150 metres from the finish and won by two lengths from Great Love, with Kotkijet two and a half lengths back in third place. Mullins was unable to attend, after contracting food poisoning on his previous visit to France but John Lynch, the gelding's owner was reportedly \\"ecstatic\\", saying \\"They said that Kotkijet was unbeatable! This shows what a great trainer Willie Mullins is. After Punchestown, Rule Supreme had a ten-day break and put on so much weight that people thought he was pregnant!\\" 2004/2005 National Hunt season In the autumn of 2004, Rule Supreme was campaigned in long distance hurdle races, beginning with a win under top weight of 165 pounds in a handicap at Clonmel Racecourse on 18 November. He then finished third behind Solerina and Brave Inca in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle and was sent to England in December where he finished third again beaten less than a length by the French-trained Baracouda in the Long Walk Hurdle at Windsor Racecourse. He returned to steeplechasing later in the month for the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown in which he was matched against Beef or Salmon and the three time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate. He was disputing second place with Best Mate, some way behind Beef or Salmon, when he fell at the second last fence. On 6 February 2005 Rule Supreme met Beef or Salmon again in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup over three miles on soft ground at Leopardstown and was made the 11/2 second favourite. Casey positioned the gelding in fourth place, moved up to third with six fences left to run and was left in second place behind Murphy's Cardinal when Pizarro fell at the next obstacle. He took the lead three fences from the finish but was soon joined by Beef or Salmon, the 8/15 favourite. Rule Supreme regained the advantage at the last fence and drew away on the run-in to win by fourteen lengths. After the race Casey said \\"He kept coming for me today and he was very good. The horse is very well in himself and we always knew he had the ability to win a race like this. I know he stays all day so I though I would put it up to Beef or Salmon and see what happened\\". Mullins reiterated his belief that the gelding had \\"a huge engine\\", but admitted that \\"jumping is just not his forte\\". At the Cheltenham Festival in March, Rule Supreme bypassed the Cheltenham Gold Cup and reverted to hurdling, starting 4/1 second favourite for the World Hurdle. In a strong renewal of Britain's most prestigious race for long distance hurdlers, he was restrained by Casey in the early stages before staying on in the closing stages to finish third behind Inglis Drever and Baracouda. At Aintree three weeks later he started 2/1 favourite for the Liverpool Hurdle, but unseated Ruby Walsh after being hampered at the second hurdle. On 27 April, Rule Supreme was matched against the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Kicking King in the Punchestown Gold Cup. He finished second, three lengths behind the Gold Cup winner, but fifteen lengths clear of the other runners. As in the previous season, Rule Supreme was sent to contest the major French hurdle races in the summer. On 29 May, he repeated his performance of 2004 by finishing third in the Prix La Barka beaten two lengths and six lengths by Rock and Palm and Cyrlight. On 18 June he attempted to win the Grande Course de Haies for a second time, but after disputing the lead for much of the way he was beaten four lengths into second place by the six-year-old Lycaon de Vauzelle. Later career Rule Supreme missed the next two seasons with injury problems returning as a twelve-year-old in the early part of 2008. He finished unpaced behind Hi Cloy in the Grade II Kinloch Brae Chase at Thurles in January and was last of the eight runners behind The Listener in the Hennessy Gold Cup a month later. In 2009 Rule Supreme was bought by Michael Winters and competed in the amateur Point-to-point circuit. He ran ten times, winning races at Dawstown, Ballindenisk and Ballingarry.
