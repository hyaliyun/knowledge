Denise Brehm, MIT News, June 2, 2011 a subject pioneered by Benoit Mandelbrot.

A close-up on a crack surface looks very much like this fractal landscape. Elisabeth Bouchaud suggested that these fractal properties could be understood in terms of the propagation of the crack front in a disordered environment, which is affected by the vicinity of a depinning transition.

He was a founding director of the Fremantle Building Society and a Justice of the Peace. He built the Oddfellows Hotel in Fremantle, which became the heritage listed Norfolk Hotel. Life George Alfred Davies' grandfather, Alfred George Davies, was said to be one of the first settlers in Fremantle, arriving 19 April 1834 on the Quebec Trader, only a few years after Captain Fremantle claimed West Australia for Britain. His father, Alfred Alexander Davies (1813-1875), was twenty-one when he emigrated with his parents and younger brother, Thomas, to Western Australia. Alfred Davies married twice, and had many children, including: George born in 1846, Edward William Davies born in 1855 and Arthur Elvin Davies, born in 1866. George attended school in Fremantle until he joined his father's business at the age of seventeen. Alfred Davies, between 1849 and 1869, built extensive real estate holdings along some of Fremantle's main streets and operated a pawnbroking business between 1870 and 1874. George formed his own business after working with his father for a decade. Davies sold spirits but he was to become well known for his wine, which he bottled and sold at premises known as the Grosvenor Cellars, in High Street and Bannister Street in Fremantle. The cellars also held bottling equipment, which enabled his business to buy in grapes to supply the demand for his creation.Wikisource:History of West Australia/George Alfred Davies In 1892 Davies was one of only three people who had a colonial wine licence in Fremantle. In 1875, he married Letitia \\"Letty\\" King (1853-1948), with whom he had nine children: George (1872-1940), an unnamed girl (1878-1878), Emma Elizabeth (1879-), Mary Elizabeth (1879-), Ernest Edgar (1884-1914), Ethel May (1888-), Harold Alfred (1893-), Nellie Hannah (1895-) and Georgina Adeline (1897-). Davies was active in public life and supported the idea of enterprises and facilities in public ownership. He was involved in establishing public baths on the sea front and in ensuring that the more attractive land around Fremantle was not sold off. The Oddfellows Hotel in 1950 Davies owned a plot of land in 1880, which he rented out, but he appears to have had the land cleared by the time he planned a new hotel building. This building, which opened in 1887, was on the corner of South Terrace and Norfolk Street and was known as the Oddfellows Hotel. This building is heritage listed and is still standing, and is now known as the Norfolk Hotel. Davies and his brother Edward were directors of the Fremantle Building Society, which Davies saw as important as it enabled others to establish themselves as property owners. Davies was elected Mayor of Fremantle in December 1894 and was made a Justice of the Peace in March 1895. He is said to have been offered a second term from November 1896 but did not take it in order to allow others to share the honour of being mayor. He was succeeded by Elias Solomon. Davies died in Fremantle on 31 January 1897 and was buried in Fremantle Cemetery.

As of fall 2011, 3,380 Canadian financial services professional held an FCSI. At the end of 2012, there were 3,500 FCSIs in good standing. A maximum of two individuals per year may also be awarded an Honorary FCSI. To date there have been 17 Honorary FCSIs awarded. A list of active FCSIs is maintained in the FCSI Directory. The FCSI Advisory Council's mandate is to ensure continued growth and promotion of the FCSI, improve protection to the public who rely on the knowledge and competence of FCSI holders, and act as key ambassadors and mentors within the financial services community. Prerequisites To earn the FCSI, candidates must already hold and maintain one or more of the following designations: * Personal Financial Planner (PFP) * Chartered Strategic Wealth Professional (CSWP) * Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) * Canadian Investment Manager (CIM) * MTI Estate and Trust Professional (MTI) * Derivatives Market Specialist (DMS) * Financial Management Advisor (FMA) * Fellow, Institute of Canadian Bankers (FICB) * Certified Financial Planner (CFP) * Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) * Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) The Fellow of CSI (FCSI) is the highest distinction offered by the Canadian Securities Institute. Work Experience Requirement To be eligible for the FCSI, a candidate must have a minimum of seven years of financial services work experience within the last 10 years of his/her career. Education Path An FCSI candidate who has the required prerequisite designation (or designations) must take two additional eligible courses from a different stream than that required for the designation(s) already held. A list is posted by the Canadian Securities Institute to identify which courses may/may not be used depending on the designation(s) already held by an FCSI candidate. In addition, all FCSI candidates must also take Financial Services Industry: Business Drivers and Challenges (FSDC). The FSDC course provides an understanding of the broader economic role and related public policy considerations of the financial services industry and how trust and confidence in the industry affect it. Certification Besides holding a pre-requisite designation and taking the additional required courses, a candidate for the FCSI must receive endorsement from a direct supervisor and from a sponsor who is a practising FCSI. This latter requirement is unique to the FCSI; it is not mandated by any other credential offered by the Canadian Securities Institute. Additionally, FCSIs may fulfil their industry contribution requirements by serving as mentors to other financial services professionals. Code of Ethics FCSIs must formally sign a Code of Ethics specific to the FCSI every year. Adherence to the FCSI Code of Ethics is monitored through reviews and periodic audits of Fellows‚Äô annual commitment and declaration, public complaints, and tracking of news and regulatory reports. Allegations of violation of the FCSI Code of Ethics are handled by the Ethics Committee according to the FCSI Ethical Misconduct Disciplinary Process. If the Ethics Committee determines a violation occurred, a disciplinary sanction is recommended. Maintaining the Credential FCSIs are required to contribute to the financial services industry and the public through: * Speaking engagements * Written/academic contributions * Committee involvement * Community involvement (charitable work) * Mentoring A minimum of 12 hours annually, outside of an FCSI‚Äôs primary job function, is mandated to fulfil the industry contribution requirement (detailed examples of qualifying contributions are posted online). FCSIs must retain supporting documents to confirm completion of industry contribution credits and are subject to an annual audit against their claims. Many FCSIs fulfil part of their industry contribution by participation in Junior Achievement‚Äôs financial literacy educational programs \\"Economics for Success\\" and \\"Dollars With Sense.\\" Last year, 76 FCSIs volunteered across Canada to deliver programs to 2,040 Junior Achievement students in 68 classrooms. Honorary FCSI program Under special circumstances, the Canadian Securities Institute may award an honorary FCSI to recognize distinguished leadership in financial services. Each year, the FCSI Advisory Council may select a maximum of two individuals to receive an honorary FCSI. Any active FCSI may nominate candidates for an honorary FCSI. Each candidate must meet the stated eligibility requirements to be considered for an honorary FCSI. In October 2004, two Canadian financial experts and media commentators were presented with the honorary FCSI: Patricia Lovett-Reid of TD Waterhouse and Fred Ketchen of Scotia McLeod. In 2011, Roberta Wilton, PhD, formerly president of CSI Global Education Inc., was awarded the Honorary FCSI.

Lupien (born October 6, 1941) is an American business executive in the financial industry. He traded actively in the financial markets throughout his career. He was a Specialist and later Exchange Governor on the Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE), a Nasdaq market maker, the Chairman and CEO of Instinet, the Chairman and CEO of OptiMark Corporation, and the Managing Director of the General Partner of a hedge fund, Kudu Partners LP. He helped develop the world's first electronic trading system. He also served on the Advisory Committee on the National Market System. In 1999 he was featured in a CNBC television series as one of five people who had changed the course of the securities industry in the 20th century. Early life Lupien was born in Chicago, IL. He lived in the Chicago area until age 16, when his family moved to Pasadena, CA. He graduated from John Muir High School in 1959. He then attended Pasadena City College until 1962, while working full-time in a variety of jobs. Following that, he attended San Diego State University, where he graduated in 1965 with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in finance and marketing. Early work experience Lupien began his financial career working for Corporate Securities, Inc. in Arcadia, CA, a brokerage firm. In June 1965, he became a clerk for Edward Calin, a Specialist on the PSE. He was drafted into US Army in September 1966, and underwent basic training at Ft. Ord. Following this, he was assigned to Sharpe Army Depot, Stockton, CA. as a Clerk Typist. While there he taught classes on investing and the securities industry to officers at the base. He was honorably discharged in September 1968, whereupon he returned to the PSE. Career in finance Lupien became a Specialist on the Pacific Exchange in 1968; his Specialist post at one point had trading responsibility for 55 stocks. Lupien was instrumental in developing the first electronic trading system in the world (SCOREX) on the PSE, which went live in 1969 in the face of substantial opposition both from members of the PSE and other Exchanges including the NYSE. Lupien executed the first-ever electronic stock trade in history using this system. During his tenure at the PSE, Lupien also worked for the brokerage firm Mitchum, Jones & Templeton (MJT), becoming Vice President in 1969, First Vice President in 1971. Lupien became President of MJT in 1974. He was a member of the PSE Floor Trading Committee, which adjudicated minor disputes on the exchange floor. He became a Governor of the PSE in 1975 and served two three-year terms, while also serving as a Floor Governor, mediating more serious exchange floor disputes and also issuing trading halts. From 1976-78, Lupien was one of several people working on the design of the Intermarket Trading System (ITS). He developed much of its rules of operation and higher-level technical specifications. He also helped found the Pacific Options Exchange in San Francisco in 1976. Lupien left MJT in 1980 to found Trading Company of the West with Tony Forstmann, but continued as a Specialist on the PSE until January 1983. He then moved to New York City as President of Institutional Networks Corp. (later renamed Instinet), and was named Chairman and CEO later that year. Instinet, the first electronic trading system for institutional investors and wholesale brokers, increased its trading volume substantially during his tenure, and Lupien retained his position for a short time after Reuters acquired the company in 1987. During this time he introduced electronic trading to a number of exchanges around the world. Instinet was the subject of two Harvard Business School case studies.Perold, Andre F. \\"Instinet Corp. (A).\\", Andre F. Perold, Harvard Business School Case 286-116, August 1986. (Revised from original April 1986 version.)Perold, Andre F. \\"Instinet Corp. (B).\\" Harvard Business School Case 286-120, July 1986. (Revised from original April 1986 version.) Lupien moved to Los Angeles in 1988 and restarted MJT as an institutional broker and Nasdaq market-maker. Acting as Chairman and CEO, Lupien moved MJT to Durango, Colorado in 1993 in order to pursue his interest in ranching. Shortly thereafter, MJT began to develop electronic order management and execution systems.U.S. Patent #5,101,353A, ‚ÄúAutomated system for providing liquidity to securities markets,‚Äù March 31, 1992 (with J.P. McCormack and H.E.C. Schulman) Later, MJT developed and marketed a suite of institutional trading software known as TOMCAT. Terry Rickard joined MJT in June 1994, and he and Lupien jointly designed and developed the OptiMark trading system. This system was spun out into a separate corporation, OptiMark Corporation, of which Lupien was Chairman and CEO.‚ÄúThe Three Dimensions of OptiMark,‚Äù Traders Magazine, Feb. 1998.Flaherty, Robert J., Will OptiMark Unlock the Floodgates of Trading?‚Äù Equities, March/April, 1998. until 2001.

He founded the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in New York, and was Distinguished Professor and chairman for 25 years. Romano was born into a poor family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, an immigrant from Italy, was a musician, and his mother, a first-generation Italian, was a welfare worker. Romano attended public schools, then entered Marquette University in Milwaukee and received his B.S. in 1932. He attended and graduated from Marquette University School of Medicine and received his M.D. in 1934. He interned at the Milwaukee County General Hospital from 1934 to 1935 and decided to practice psychiatry. He took a second internship at Yale University to broaden his experience in neurology which was followed by a Commonwealth Fellowship at the University of Colorado under Franklin Ebaugh, M.D., a prominent psychiatric educator and researcher. Romano stayed in Colorado from 1935 to 1938. During these years, Romano received broad experience in psychosomatic medicine and patient care, and he taught medical students. Deciding on a medical specialty, he received further training in neurology. His Commonwealth Fellowship was transferred to Boston City Hospital and he stayed there between 1938 and 1939. He also received another fellowship to study psychoanalysis at the Boston City Hospital. Romano later reflected that the neurology training had broadened his knowledge of clinical medicine, neurology and psychiatry. He also came to the attention of Soma Weiss, M.D., who had heard of Romano's skill in clinical teaching and research and served as his mentor. In June 1942, Romano moved to the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine to become the chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and he remained for four years. His enhanced the teaching of medical students and residents in mind-body relationships and improved community services. He introduced psychiatric training into all four years of the medical curriculum as an integral part of medicine and the medical care of patients. During his years at the University of Cincinnati, Romano continued his research interests. His studies included delirium, fainting, and decompression. While in Boston, he met George L. Engel, M.D., an internist, researcher, psychoanalyst who had a particular interest in psychosomatic medicine. Romano brought Engel to Cincinnati and later to Rochester where they continued to teach and conduct research together. In 1945, Romano was offered and accepted the Chair of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical School which was established in 1920. Teaching psychiatry to medical student in each year of medical school was welcomed by the internal medicine department and provided Romano with the opportunity to become involved with the care of patients in other hospitals and clinics in Rochester. He obtained funds to build a psychiatric wing at the Strong Memorial Hospital of the University of Rochester Medical School, and he broaden the work of his department to include psychology and social work training and research. He remained as chair of psychiatry at Rochester until 1971 when he became Emeritus. In 1968, he was named Distinguished Professor. One of the residences on the ground of the Rochester Psychiatric Center was named after John Romano. Romano received many awards: an honorary D.Sc. from Marquette University in 1971 and from Hahnemann University Hospital in 1974. In 1971, he received the Gold Medal Award of the University of Rochester Medical School alumni. In 1972, he received the Gold-Headed Cane from the University of California Medical School. He received the William Menninger award from the American College of Physicians in 1973. He served on the Board of Overseers of Harvard Medical School from 1949 to 1954. He organized and served on the first Advisory Mental Health Council of the National Institute of Mental Health. He was a consultant to the U.S. Army Surgeon General after World War II. He published over 200 scientific papers and served on several editorial boards including the Journal of Psychiatric Research. Romano died in Rochester in 1994 after an acute stroke.

It was part of Jan III Sobieski‚Äôs autumn expedition, aimed at destruction of mounted Tatar units, which plundered southeastern provinces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the Battle of Niemirow, Crown Hetman Jan Sobieski headed towards Grodek Jagiellonski, with some 2,500-3,000 cavalry and dragoons. When his unit reached the area of Jaworow, Sobieski realized that main Crimean Tatar forces advanced towards Przemysl and then southwards to Sambir. Polish hetman decided to stop their retreat, and after a skirmish at the village of Hoszany, Tatar prisoners told the Poles that a 10,000 strong army under Noradin-Soltan camped in a valley near the town of Komarno. The Tatars were supported by the Cossacks of Petro Doroshenko. Sobieski wanted to surprise the enemy, ordering his soldiers to march 57 kilometers in a heavy rain and along muddy roads. His plan for the battle was to carry out a mock attack in the center of the Tatar-Cossack camp, and then to use his main forces to attack the left wing, in order to keep the Tatars away from the Wereszyca riverWereszyca river crossing. Polish forces were divided into two groups - a 1,000-strong unit under Stefan Bidzinski, and a 1,500-strong unit with the hussars under Sobieski. At app. 4 p.m. the Tatars noticed the group of Bidzinski and mounted an attack, using their main forces. Soon afterwards, the hussars of Sobieski attacked their left wing, which resulted in a Tatar retreat towards the river. Those enemy soldiers who tried to cross the Wereszyca were killed, while other Tatars managed to flee towards Rudki. The slaughter of the invaders continued until nighttime, and only 1,500 Tatars managed to cross the Dniester, and return to their homeland. Sobieski‚Äôs forces also freed some 20,000 civilians, captured by the hordes.  Gallery  File:Monument to victims of the Tatar raids XVII century.

D. Augustus Straker was a black lawyer and jurist. Early life and education David Augustus Straker was born in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1842 to John and Margaret Straker. His father died when he was eleven months old and he was raised by his mother. He attended the Dame School until he was eleven, then had a private tutor for two years before entering the Central Public School of the Island led by Robert P. Elliott. He started to learn the tailor's trade, but did not enjoy it and withdrew, instead taking instruction in French and Latin under Rev. Joseph N. Durant and in education by R. R. Rawle at Codrington College. At the age of seventeen he was appointed principal of St. Mary's School and worked as a school teacher at St. Amis' School and St. Giles' School. In 1866, Rev. Benjamin B. Smith, Episcopal Bishop of the Protestant Church of America, asked Rawle if there were any black people who would agree to emigrate to the United States to teach former slaves, and Straker volunteered. Straker began teaching in Louisville, Kentucky in schools set up by the Episcopal Church and the Freedmen's Bureau. He also began to prepare to become a minister, but did not pursue that career. In 1870, Straker was induced to enroll in Howard University Law School by John M. Langston, and he graduated in June 1871. While a student he worked as stenographer for Freedmen's Bureau head Oliver O. Howard. He also took a position as teacher at Howard in the Normal and Preparatory Department. He held a LL. B. degree from Howard University and a LL. D. from Selma University.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p744-751 In September 1871 he married Ann Carey, daughter of Thomas and Julia Carey, in Detroit, Michigan. Political career In 1871 he was appointed clerk in the auditor's office of the United States Treasury Department in Washington, DC where he remained until 1875. He then took a position as Inspector of Customs at the port of Charleston, South Carolina. In 1876 he began practicing law in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, and was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives as a Republican. In that election, incumbent Republican governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain and Democratic candidate Wade Hampton III both claimed victory and established separate governments. Eventually Chamberlain conceded and numerous Republican legislators including Straker were removed from the government. Straker was reelected in 1877 and 1878, but denied his seat both years. In 1878 he formed a law partnership with Robert B. Elliott and T. McCants Stewart. Elliot was an agent of the Treasury Department and Straker was appointed special Inspector of Customs in Elliott's office. His political career would diminish, but in 1884 he was nominated Lieutenant- Governor at the Republican State Convention, but the ticket was abandoned. He was highly respected and befriended numerous important Republicans. He, George T. Downing, and James Wormley were the sole three black men who were with Charles Sumner at Sumner's death in 1874. Death of Charles Sumner by Currier & Ives. Law career In 1882, Straker became dean and law professor at Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina. He had become a well respected lawyer and had appeared in several important cases. A particular case was the defense of James Coleman, who was accused of Murder. R. G. Bonham represented the state, and Straker and Coleman won the case with an insanity plea. He also won two cases against the Bethel A.M.E. church, one regarding a property issue, and the other in support of the minister in dispute with a part of the congregation. In his law work, he worked with J. W. Morris, who would be elected president of Allen University in 1885. Straker also took part in numerous educational conventions and played an important role in the colored department of the 1884 World Cotton Centennial in New Orleans. He also was a noted speaker and wrote a number of articles for religious journals, particularly the A. M. E. Review. =Michigan= In 1885 he visited Detroit, Michigan where he was well received and gave a number of speeches. He later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he became the first black lawyer to appear before the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1890, in the case Ferguson v.

Its common name, \\"Pelekete\\", means \\"hewn with an axe\\" in Greek, and refers to its location on a steep rock.Talbot (1991), p. 1620 The monastery was a centre of iconodule opposition to Byzantine Iconoclasm, and in 763/4, it was attacked and burned down by the fanatically iconoclast governor Michael Lachanodrakon. Lachanodrakon tortured the monastery's hegoumenos, Theosteriktos, and other monks, 38 of whom were buried alive at Ephesus.Talbot (1991), p. 1620 The monastery was restored towards the end of the century after the end of the first period of Iconoclasm, and a certain Makarios became its hegoumenos.

His major interests were in the relationship of social, economic and cultural factors upon health. Rosen was born in New York City to immigrant parents from Eastern Europe. He was educated in local public schools and graduated from the City College of New York in 1930. Unable to obtain admission to a medical school because of quotas for Jewish students, he entered the University of Berlin Medical School in Germany, and received his medical degree in 1935 after completing a medical thesis. In Berlin, Rosen met the medical historian Henry E. Sigerist from The Johns Hopkins University Medical School, who suggested to Rosen that he write his thesis on William Beaumont who had studied and published on gastric physiology. His friendship with Sigerist became lifelong. While in medical school Rosen met Beate Caspari and married her in 1933. She later assisted Rosen in his historical writings. Upon his return to New York City, Rosen interned at the Beth-El Hospital in Brooklyn for two years and soon began submitting articles to Sigerist‚Äôs Bulletin of the History of Medicine. Rosen began his private practice in 1937 but it was not financially secure and he took a part-time job in the Tuberculosis Service of the New York State Department of Health. In time, the Department of Health job became full-time and Rosen later became administrator of Public Health Clinics in New York. Later, he became a District Health Officer. In 1949, he served as Director of Health Education in the New York City Department of Health. During these years, he attended the School of Public Health at Columbia University and earned a Masters of Public Health (MPH) in 1947. In 1950, he became a Diplomate of the American Board of Public Health. Rosen took courses in sociology at Columbia University in 1939 and completed his Ph.D. in sociology in 1944. His doctoral thesis was titled ‚ÄúThe Specialization of Medicine with Particular Reference to Ophthalmology.‚Äù He entered the U.S. Army during World War II and was assigned to the Surgeon General‚Äôs Office as an epidemiologist. He was transferred to London where his knowledge of German was used in intelligence work. He returned to the New York City Department of Health after the war but left in 1950 to become medical director of Health Insurance Program (HIP), a prepaid group medical practice. He stayed for seven years. In 1951, he was appointed to a part-time professorship in health education at Columbia University and taught courses in health education, community health, the sociology of mental illness, and the history of medicine. In 1957, he became a full-time professor. In 1969, Rosen left Columbia to become professor of medical history and public health at Yale University. He remained until his death in 1977. Rosen‚Äôs literary career began with his thesis at medical school and over time assumed major proportions. From 1938 to 1944, with the help from Sigerist, Rosen began to submit articles and later editor of The Ciba Foundation Symposium, a historical brochure financed by the drug company and distributed to physicians. In 1944, he took over the editorship until the publication was discontinued in 1950. Rosen published articles and books on public health and the history of medicine, and the sociological, economic, and cultural aspects on health. By the time he died in 1977, he had a bibliography of nine books and approximately 200 articles. While Rosen was still in the Army, he and two associates founded the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences. Rosen was the editor between 1946 and 1952, and he remained on the Editorial Board. He was also the editor of the American Journal of Public Health from 1957 to 1973 and served on the Editorial Board. Works * Rosen, George.

It concerns a controversial Buddhist reliquary from the Piprahwa Stupa in Uttar Pradesh, India. It was released in May, 2013, and was broadcast in July 2013 in the US on PBS as part of the Secrets of the Dead series. Content Writer and host Charles Allen investigates the Piprahwa Stupa, a large Buddhist Stupa which is argued to be one of the eight resting places of the Buddha's ashes.The Buddha and Dr F√ºhrer, (2008) Charles Allen, Haus Publishing, London In 1898, estate manager and amateur archaeologist W.C. Pepp√© excavated the stupa, finding a large brick dome with a sarcophagus, or coffer, at the center. Inside were four vessels (three stoneware, one glass) along with about 1600 small jewels and gold pieces ‚Äî the Piprahwa treasure ‚Äî all of undetermined age. One of the stoneware vessels ‚Äî the \\"Piprahwa reliquary\\" ‚Äî contained jewels mixed with ashes and bone. Pepp√© made the mistake of consulting Dr Alois Anton F√ºhrer ‚Äî a German archaeologist who soon became notorious for forging other Buddhist relics. In presenting the background to the story, Allen visits the Buddhist sites of Kushinagar and Sanchi, as well as the old Pepp√© family manor house, now in a state of extreme neglect. Allen interviews Harry Falk (professor of Indology at the Freie Universit√§t in Berlin and said to be the \\"world's foremost expert\\" in ancient Indian languages and history), who states that F√ºhrer could not have forged the Piprahwa reliquary inscription. This is, Falk says, because he lacked sufficient knowledge of the language (Prakrit) in which its inscription was written, and, more importantly, he could have never known the Sanskrit word nidhane (\\"container\\"), which is written on the reliquary, a hapax legomenon (unique example) in the entire corpus of Brahmi script. That said, however, F√ºhrer had taught Sanskrit for three years at St. Xavier's College, Bombay,Arx, Urs von (2005). In Marco Jorio, Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz vol. 4, Basel: Schwabe and was one of the editors of Epigraphia Indica;F√ºhrer, Alois Anton; Hultzsch, E; Burgess, James (1892-1894). Epigraphia Indica: a collection of inscriptions supplementary to the Corpus inscriptionum Indicarum, Calcutta: Government printing that he had translated Sanskrit texts, and that nidhane occurs commonly enough in such Sanskrit textual sources. Falk concludes that the reliquary found at Piprahwa in 1898 did contain a portion of the ashes of the Buddha, and that the inscription is authentic. According to him, the inscription translates as \\"these are the relics of the Buddha, the Lord\\".Excerpt from The Bones of the Buddha The conclusion is that the Piprahwa Stupa was built by the Emperor Ashoka 150 years later in 245 BCE over the original and simpler interment site created by Shakya clansmen for the 1/8th of the Buddha's ashes they had been apportioned. Falk points to the close similarity of materials used at Piprahwa and its grand size with other Ashokan stupas, and that the coffer containing the reliquary found at Piprahwa closely reflects Ashokan workmanship, design, and the type of sandstone used for monuments like the Lumbini pillar erected during his reign. (In 1971, Indian archeologist K.S. Srivastava excavated deeper into the stupa than Pepp√© had, uncovering two chambers each containing a soapstone casket with redware fragments. This is taken as confirmation of the existence of an earlier, deeper burial site at Piprahwa dating back to the death of the Buddha.)

Created by television writer Susan Harris, the series was produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions and ABC Studios(Touchstone Television.) It starred Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Estelle Getty as the main characters Dorothy Zbornak, Blanche Devereaux, Rose Nylund, and Sophia Petrillo. The series revolves around the lives of three middle aged women living together in a house in Miami. The first season of The Golden Girls premiered to strong ratings for NBC, ranking number one in its first week on air and number seven among all primetime programs airing during the 1985‚Äì86 primetime network season. Upon its initial airing, the show was met with critical acclaim and was the recipient of various industry awards, including three Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe awards. Warner Bros. Home Video released the first season on DVD in the United States on February 7, 2006, and in Canada on April 10, 2007. Episodes Development =Conception= The Golden Girls was based on a parody performed by Selma Diamond and Doris Roberts (pictured). NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield conceived the idea of the series during the filming of a television special aimed at promoting the new 1984‚Äì85 season lineup. The special featured a skit by Night Courts Selma Diamond and Remington Steeles Doris Roberts promoting the upcoming show Miami Vice as Miami Nice, a parody about old people living in Miami, Florida. Amused by the performance, he visualized a series based on the geriatric humor of the female performers. Littlefield met with producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, who were pitching a series about a female lawyer, to ask about developing Miami Nice. Witt asked his wife, Susan Harris, to write the series after the duo's original writer had declined. Harris, who was planning on retiring after Thomas and her ABC series Soap, was interested, noting that \\"it was a demographic that had never been addressed.\\" Though her vision of a sitcom about women in their 60s differed with NBC's request to write a comedy about women at the age of around 40, Littlefield was impressed when he received Harris' pilot script and subsequently approved production of the pilot. The Cosby Show director Jay Sandrich, who had previously worked with Harris, Witt, and Thomas on Soap, agreed to direct. The pilot also includes the girls' gay houseboy, Coco (Charles Levin), who lived with them. Levin had been suggested by then-NBC president Brandon Tartikoff based on his groundbreaking recurring gay role, Eddie Gregg, on NBC's Emmy-winning drama, Hill Street Blues. After the pilot, the character of Coco was eliminated from the series. =Crew= The season aired on NBC in the United States on Saturday nights at 9:00 pm EST. Harris, her husband Paul Junger Witt, and Tony Thomas were the executive producers for the season. The season featured a panel of writers. Harris and Winifred Hervey each wrote five episodes for the season. Writing duos James Berg and Stan Zimmerman and Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman each wrote three episodes for the season, while Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan wrote five episodes, including the season finale. Liz Sage wrote two episodes, and Susan Beavers, Bob Colleary, Christopher Lloyd, and Stuart Silverman were each credited for an episode. Directors for the season included Paul Bogart, Jim Drake, Terry Hughes, Jay Sandrich, Jack Shea, and Gary Shimokawa. Bogart directed four episodes for the season. Hughes was credited for 10 episodes, and Drake received directing credits for eight episodes. Sandrich, Shea, and Shimokawa each directed one episode for the season. =Casting= Based on their previous work on Maude and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rue McClanahan and Betty White were considered for the parts of Rose Nylund, the bubbly Nordic woman, and Blanche Devereaux, the sexy siren, respectively. Sandrich, who was hired to film the pilot, suggested that the women switch roles to avoid typecasting. The character of Dorothy Zbornak was tailored toward Bea Arthur, but being unavailable at the time, the producers looked at Elaine Stritch for the role. When her audition flopped, Harris asked McClanahan to convince Arthur, with whom she costarred on Maude, to take the role. Arthur flipped upon reading the script, but was apprehensive because of McClanahan's approach, as she did not \\"want to play (their Maude characters) Maude and Vivian meet Sue Ann Nivens.\\" Arthur was further convinced when hearing that White would be playing Rose and McClanahan would be playing Blanche. The role of Sophia Petrillo, Dorothy's mother, was played by Estelle Getty, who was discovered by Tony Thomas while performing in the Broadway play Torch Song Trilogy as the mother character. Getty, being younger than Arthur and White, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to age her. The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-age women could be young. Disney's Michael Eisner explains, \\"Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it seem like it could be a contemporary, young show.\\" Reception and accolades =Ratings= The Golden Girls debuted on September 14, 1985, in its 9:00 pm Saturday-night timeslot, following a broadcast of the Miss America contest and preceding another new comedy series, 227. The debut episode garnered a 25.0 household rating and a 43 share, which translates to a reach of 21.5 million homes. It was the highest-rated program of the week, and the highest-rated premiere of a program in two years. The show also elevated the ratings for Saturday nights, which were on a steep decline in the years preceding its debut. After five episodes, the series was averaging a 21.5 household rating, landing among the top-20 highest-rated programs. =Critical reception= On Metacritic, a site which uses a weighted mean score, the season scored a 82/100 from six critics, translating to \\"universal acclaim\\". =Accolades= At the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards, The Golden Girls won the award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Betty White received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, with White winning for her performance in the episode \\"In a Bed of Rose's\\". Estelle Getty received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan won the Emmy award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for the episode \\"A Little Romance\\". Susan Harris also received nomination for the award for the pilot episode. Directors Jim Drake and Terry Hughes each received a nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for their work in \\"The Heart Attack\\" and \\"A Little Romance\\", respectively. At the 43rd Golden Globe Awards, the series won the award for Best Television Series ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. The four lead actress were each nominated for the award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy, with Getty tying with Cybill Shepherd for the award.

History In the early 18th century, the Nadars were a community mostly engaged in the palmyra industry, including the production of toddy. However, there were a few subsects comprising wealthy landlords and money lenders.Bishop Stephen Neill: from Edinburgh to South India By Dyron B. Daughrity Although numerically dominant in the area, the Nadars had a minimal interaction with other communities and they were themselves divided by their various endogamous subcastes, and thus lacked communal cohesion. While the majority of the Nadar population of the region were poor, landless laborers. Due to their association with toddy, the Nadars were considered lower than other middle castes, but relatively higher than the low castes, and were also prohibited to enter temples built by higher ranked castes. And after the following years Nadar people in every region decided to build a temple and a grocery shops for themselves. Andso in Nadars of Thirumangalam have also decided to build a temple at the heart of the city and they started working for the basement. And there, they founded a Goddess statue along with the some gods of Hindu mythology. They planned to establish a temple around there.

Jalil has been praised for being crucial in the BBC's coverage of the Afghanistan civil war and as a highly credible journalist. On 29 July 1994, he was returning from an interview with Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar when masked men kidnapped him, and Jalil was found murdered the next morning outside of Kabul. Jalil's aggressive coverage of the civil war between the mujahedeen was seen as authoritative and is said to be the reason of his fate.  Personal  Mirwais Jalil was born the son of a medical practitioner in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1969. Growing up, Mirwais became fluent in Persian and Pashto, two main languages in Afghanistan. After Mirwais finished high school in Kabul, his family moved to Pakistan to escape the dangerous and volatile landscape that had erupted in Kabul. Mirwais took an English class and soon became a freelance reporter. His freelance reporting would soon land him a position with the BBC where he would cover the raging Afghanistan civil war that was waging in Kabul. Miwais enjoyed the excitement of covering the front lines in Kabul and his passion and authoritative reporting made him a valued journalists in covering the war in Kabul.  Career  Mirwais Jalil began his short career in journalism by taking an English class in Pakistan. He began his career doing freelance journalism which would later lead to his position with the BBC. He soon became a key factor in the raging civil war that took place in Afghanistan in the early 1990s. At the time of his death, Mirwais was working freelance for the BBC's Pashto and Persian services. He had been with the BBC for less than 2 years but was well cultured and involved with the reports from the frontline. Mirwais was only 25 when he was killed but was often to referred to as vigorous and enthusiastic. He enjoyed being on the front lines in Kabul and would remain there even after others had retired for the day. Mirwais enjoyed showing other journalists around. The BBC has said that Mirwais was their top Afghanistan correspondent at the time of his death.  Death  Mirwais's life came to an end on 29 July 1994. Mirwais Jalil was returning from an interview with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Afghanistan's prime minister in 1994. Mirwais was travelling on a dirt road near Kabul with an Italian journalist, Ettore Mo from Corriere della Sera, when the Volkswagen was ambushed by a black sedan where five half masked figures jumped out and grabbed Mirwais from the car he was travelling in. He was brutally pulled from his backseat position in the car where he was dragged against his will at gunpoint and put into the waiting black sedan. The black sedan fled at high speeds away from Ettore and Sharif, the driver of Mirwais's car. Mirwais was the only passenger kidnapped. Those were the final moments anyone saw Mirwais alive. His body was found with multiple stab wounds and gun shots and was discovered only a couple kilometres from where he had been abducted near Chelsitoon, Afghanistan, a suburb of Kabul.  Context  Chelsitoon is a suburb in the south of Kabul.There was a civil war in full battle at the time of Mirwais's death. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was engulfed in a fierce battle with the Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani over Kabul and strategic positions that both forces wanted to occupy. At the time of Mirwais's death in July, it had been reported that \\"1.5 million Afghans had already lost their life in the war,\\" according to the New York Times. The fighting was the fiercest in Kabul for a number of weeks. After Mirwais's death, both Hekmatyar and Rabbani blamed the other party for his death. While the Afghan leaders and commanders enjoyed interviews, they were upset to have reports about their unfavorable war manoeuvres broadcast. This caused tension between journalists and the warring parties.  Impact  Mirwais Jalil was one of many journalists killed in Afghanistan in 1994. His vibrant, young personality helped getting reports from the front line of the raging war that might not have other wise been reported. He also managed to be one of the first journalists to interview Hekmatyar since the Battle of Laghman. Mirwais Jalil was noted as having witnessed a loss for Hekmatyar's troop in a battle that the Prime Minister denied. He was very vocal in criticising Mirwais's reporting of the battle and Mirwais pointed out what he had witnessed. Mirwais was credited along with his fellow journalists, with giving the BBC a reputation for \\"objectivity\\" and is noted for performing a \\"vital job of informing his own and other people about the day to day realities of life and politics in Afghanistan.\\"  Reactions  After Mirwais's death, the editor of the BBC sent out letters to both Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani in an attempt to get better protection for the journalists covering the bloody war. The BBC refused to say who they thought was responsible for Mirwais's death. Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar blamed President Burhanuddin Rabbani for the death of Mirwais, and President Burhanuddin Rabbani blamed Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. People from the United Nations and individual governments believed that Afghanistan was in so much turmoil that the country was beyond help and the world was now looking down on the devastation and destruction of Afghanistan.

Rolf originated from an extratropical system near western France on November 4\\\\. Despite the unfavorable conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, Rolf transitioned into a subtropical depression on November 7, before becoming a fully tropical storm later that day. On November 8, Rolf reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds peaking at , and a minimum pressure of . During the next day, the storm made landfall on the island of √éle du Levant, France, and soon afterwards, near Hy√®res in Southeastern France. Rolf quickly weakened and dissipated on November 10, following its second landfall. Rolf was the first tropical cyclone ever to be officially monitored by the NOAA in the Mediterranean Sea. Rolf was also the costliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in the 2010s, with the storm causing at least $1.25 billion (2011 USD) in damages. Meteorological history On November 4, an extratropical disturbance was spawned just off the coast of western France, within a cold front, by another extratropical cyclone to the north, named \\"Quinn.\\" This storm began causing heavy rainfall in northern Italy, leading to flooding in the region. On the next day, a low-pressure area formed over western France, and the system was named Rolf by the Free University of Berlin, which names all significant low pressure systems affecting Europe. As the storm slowly moved eastward, it caused flooding in the Balearic Islands. Rolf gradually organized, and convection began to increase in the storm. Over the next couple of days, the storm continued to organize as it moved eastward, approaching the northwestern coast of Italy. On November 5, Rolf's forward motion slowed while the storm was stationed above the Massif Central in southern France, maintaining a central pressure of . On November 6, the system moved into the western Mediterranean Sea and stalled off the coast of Liguria, while gradually strengthening, bringing additional flooding to the region. Around the same time, the storm's frontal structure shrunk to in length. During that evening, Rolf spawned a tornado over Alassio, in northern Italy, causing some structural damage. On November 7, 2011, Rolf turned westward and slowly transitioned from an extratropical system into a subtropical depression over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, with the system acquiring a warm quasi-symmetric core, and with organized convective rainbands wrapping around the center of the storm. The storm was then given the designation Invest 99L, by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (the NRL). The NOAA also began watching the subtropical depression, which was now located in the Gulf of Lion. Later that day, Rolf transitioned from a subtropical depression into a tropical depression off the coast of France, and the NOAA gave Rolf the identifier 01M. Late on November 7, Rolf attained tropical storm status as it completed its tropical transition, strengthening significantly in the process, with the NOAA noting that deep convention had persisted around the core of Rolf for long enough to officially declare the system a tropical storm. Consequently, both the Satellite Services Division and NESDIS of the NOAA classified the storm as Tropical Storm 01M. Rolf then began to bring heavy rainfall to the nearby countries in Western Europe, including Northern Italy and Eastern Spain. On November 8, Rolf strengthened further, as it approached the southeastern coast of France. On the same day, Rolf reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of , and maximum 1-minute sustained winds of . Rolf began to weaken on November 9, with the storm's convection decreasing and its upper- and mid-level circulation centers becoming misaligned. Later that day, Rolf weakened into a tropical depression shortly before making landfall in France, and the NOAA issued their final bulletin on the storm, as Rolf was expected to dissipate soon, with the storm weakening to around the time of its landfall. Later that day, Rolf made landfall on the island of √éle du Levant, and soon afterward, made another landfall near Hy√®res, in Southeastern France, weakening rapidly upon making its second landfall. Early on November 10, Tropical Storm Rolf (01M) fully dissipated, following its second landfall. Preparations and impact Hy√®res, France, on November 9. Tropical Storm Rolf caused heavy flooding across Italy, France, and Switzerland, even as a precursor. From November 6-8, the storm dropped a total of of rain in about 72 hours over southwestern Europe. In both France and Italy, the heavy rainfall from the storm caused many rivers to overflow their banks, resulting in cities being flooded and enormous property losses ensuing. Officials in France noted that 16 departments in southern France sustained severe flooding and losses. Some of the hardest hit areas in France included Valleraugue, Sabli√®res, Loubaresse, Draguignan, Arles, and Cannes, while in Italy, the cities that experienced the worst flooding were Genoa, Milan, Venice, and Turin. About 12 people total died from the storm; 6 people were Italian, and 5 were French. The storm caused at least $1.25 billion in damages, in the areas affected. On December 16, 2011, the NOAA declared that they would no longer be monitoring storms in the Mediterranean Sea, possibly due to economic reasons and budget cuts. However, in 2015, the NOAA resumed services in the Mediterranean region, and by 2016, the NOAA was issuing advisories on a new tropical system, Tropical Storm 90M. =Italy= Prior to Rolf, northern Italy had already experienced a period of heavy rainfall during the first few days of November, which was later worsened by the additional rainfall brought by Rolf. The cities of Genoa and Recco in Liguria, in northern Italy, suffered some of the worst impacts from the storm, with Rolf's precursor bringing a period of prolonged rainfall since November 4. On November 4, Rolf killed 6 people and triggered the evacuations of a few thousand people in northern Italy, due to flooding from rainfall that began on the previous day. The Ferregiano, a leftward-flowing tributary of the Bisagno, overflowed its banks by . The Genoa-Sestri Levante section of Highway A12 in Italy was closed, due to the flooding, and air and rail traffic in the region were suspended. The road between Recco and Camogli was also flooded. On November 5, lightning struck the roof of a house in Camogli, starting a fire that was quickly put out by firefighters. The storm also caused multiple small landslides and downed numerous trees in Liguria. Flooding from Rolf also led to traffic obstructions by November 6 in Piedmont and Tigullio, in the Province of Savona, after severe thunderstorms dumped large amounts of rainfall on the night of November 5‚Äì6. The flooding also caused blackouts in the Province of Savona on that night, and homes in the area suffered from flooded garages and basements. On the evening of November 6, Rolf spawned a tornado over Alassio, in the Province of Savona, damaging buildings and walkways in Piazza d'Italia, and flooding basements in the village of Barusso. In Calice al Cornoviglio, chasms opened up in the roads after multiple collapses, due to damage from the floodwaters. From November 6‚Äì7, of rain fell in Triora, in the Province of Imperia, which led to flooding in Sanremo that forced the evacuation of 25 families, with a total of 40 people, from a six- story building. On November 7, rainfall from Rolf caused a landslide in Savignone, which blocked Provincial Road 10. Rolf also caused a landslide in the Province of Genoa that broke the natural gas line between Casella and Montoggio, which was estimated to require 4 to 6 months to repair. In Genoa, schools closed from November 5‚Äì9. In total, Rolf caused at least $160 million (2011 USD) in damages in Italy. The Italian Government was criticized for the poor hydrogeological conditions in the city of Genova after Rolf, as well as the lack of safety measures for preventing the disaster, which led to a political controversy. =France= In southern France, 16 departments suffered severe flooding and damage from Rolf. The Department of Var in France was severely impacted by Rolf, with 2,500 people evacuated from the Argens region. The Alpes-Maritimes district along the Var River was also heavily impacted. During its landfalls, Rolf triggered floods across southern France, from the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques all the way to the French‚ÄìItalian border, as well as on the island of Corsica. The Caisse Centrale de R√©assurance (CCR), the French state insurance company, estimated that Rolf caused around ‚Ç¨800 million (US$1.09 billion) in insured losses in France.

The church dates from the 13th century and contains an unusual large and elborately decorated triumphal cross or rood. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. History √ñja Church is built in a place of ancient cultural traditions. The name, from the Swedish word √∂, meaning island, indicates that the place was inhabited before the area became a part of mainland Gotland (through the process of post-glacial rebound), i.e. during the Iron Age, sometime between circa 500 BCE and 500 CE. As late as 1987, there were still fields in the area cultivated according to a system of land use which probably developed already then, or possibly even during the Bronze Age. The first church on the site was built during the 12th century. Of this first Romanesque church, only a few sculpted fragments have survived, incorporated into the presently visible, largely Gothic church. During the 13th century, construction of the present building began. The choir with its internal apse was built first, during the first half of the century. The nave was added after, at the end of the century, while the tower was added during the 14th century. The construction of the church indicates that the original plans did not include a separate tower, but rather a tower above the western end of the nave. Scholars have concluded that the tower was built by a stonemason's workshop which is sometimes referred to by the notname Egypticus, which was also active at e.g. Gr√∂tlingbo and Hablingo churches, located elsewhere on Gotland. The church has remained largely unchanged since the Middle Ages, with the exception of the vestry which was added in the 19th century. Architecture Externally, the church is noteworthy for its unusually well-preserved tower, complete with original gargoyles and gable decorations. The church also has three carved Gothic portals, of which the northern is the mostly richly decorated. Here are sculptures representing Jesus, Mary, John the Evangelist and a peculiar sculpture of a saint lying down, interpreted as Saint Eligius. The interior of the church is dark and characterised by the church's sturdy columns and pillars. The walls are decorated with murals dating from the 15th century, depicting the Passion of Christ and scenes from the childhood of Christ, made by the artist known as the Master of the Passion of Christ. In addition, purely ornamental decoration from the 13th century adorns the vaults, and a few more unusual murals, probably made by an artist from Denmark or mainland Sweden, decorate the choir. The church is probably most famous for its large and elaborately carved triumphal cross. It has been executed by a wood-carver, possibly trained in France, who might also be the artist behind a somewhat similar cross in Fr√∂jel Church and it dates from the late 13th century. The unusually elaborate crucifix has been called \\"Gotland's most admired wooden sculpture\\" and \\"one of Gotland's most well-known medieval pieces of art\\". Beneath the cross are furthermore copies of two almost equally well-regarded sculptures depicting Mary and St. John (the original sculptures are now in the Museum of Gotland in Visby).

The Presidency of Yugoslavia declared a state of emergency in Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica, which led to rioting. The unrest was suppressed by a large police intervention that caused numerous casualties, and a period of political repression followed.  Background  The University of Pristina was the starting point of the 1981 Kosovo student protests. Kosovo's cultural isolation within Yugoslavia and its endemic poverty resulted in the province having the highest ratio of both students and illiterates in Yugoslavia. A university education was no guarantee of a successful future; instead of training students for technical careers, the university specialized in liberal arts, in particular in Albanology, which could hardly secure work except in bureaucracy or local cultural institutions, especially outside of Kosovo. This created a large pool of unemployed but highly educated, and resentful, Albanians ‚Äì prime recruits for nationalist sentiment. Demonstrations were organized by several professors and students: Besim Baraliu, Fehmi Lladrovc. In addition, the Serb and Montenegrin population of Kosovo increasingly resented the economic and social burden incurred by the university's student population. By 1981, the University of Pristina had 20,000 students ‚Äì one in ten of the city's total population.  Student protests  The demonstrations started on 11 March 1981, originally as a spontaneous small-scale protest for better food in the school cafeteria and improved living conditions in the dormitories. Tired of being made to wait in line, for hours, for poor quality food, students began demonstrating under Besim Baraliu's command, who later was arrested. Two to four thousand demonstrators were dispersed by police, with around a hundred arrests made. The student protests resumed two weeks later on 26 March 1981, as several thousand demonstrators chanted increasingly nationalist slogans, and the police used force to disperse them, injuring 32 people. The engagement included a sit-in by Albanian students in a dormitory. As the police reacted negatively to a perceived increase in nationalism among the protesters, more arrests were made, which in turn fueled more protests. On 30 March, students of the three of the largest university faculties declared a boycott, fearing a return of Rankoviƒáism. The demands of the Albanian students were both nationalist and egalitarianist, implying a desire for a different kind of socialism than the Yugoslav kind, marked by semi-confederalism and workers' self-management.  Escalation of protests  On 1 April, demonstrations swept through Kosovo, and 17 policemen were injured in clashes with demonstrators, failing to disperse them. The army moved in to secure state institutions, and Mahmut Bakalli soon called on them to send tanks to the streets. Within days, the protests over conditions for students turned into discontent over the treatment of the ethnic Albanian population by the Serbian majority, and then to rioting and Albanian nationalist demands. The primary demand was that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia as opposed to its then-current status as a province of Serbia. The authorities blamed the protests on nationalist radicals ‚Äì the May 1981 Politika said the goal of the protests was for a Republic of Kosovo to become separate from Yugoslavia, and join Albania. The authorities imposed a ban on foreign reporting, and the local reporting, unlike at the time of the 1968 protests in Kosovo, entirely lacked independence, and instead ran only official statements. Some of the official statements were inherently vague, talking of \\"internal and external enemies\\", which provoked a variety of conspiracy theories that stoked nationalist sentiment elsewhere in Yugoslavia. One of the conspiracy theories was promoted by Azem Vllasi, who later publicly discussed the alleged involvement of the Albanian security service Sigurimi in the protests. The demand that Kosovo become the seventh republic of Yugoslavia was politically unacceptable to Serbia and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Some Serbs (and possibly some Albanian nationalists as well) saw the demands as being a prelude to a \\"Greater Albania\\" which could encompass parts of Montenegro, the North Macedonia and Kosovo itself. A standoff happened near Podujevo, where police reinforcements coming in from Central Serbia were stopped by Albanian demonstrators who had taken local Serbs and Montenegrins as hostages.  State of emergency  The leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia saw the protesters' opposition to self-management and their nationalism as a grave threat, and decided to \\"suppress them by all available means\\". On 2 April 1981 the Presidency of Yugoslavia under the chairmanship of Cvijetin Mijatoviƒá declared a state of emergency in Pristina and Kosovska Mitrovica, which lasted one week. Presidency sent in special forces to stop the demonstrations. The federal government rushed up to 30,000 troops to the province. Riots broke out and the Yugoslav authorities used force against the protesters. On 3 April, the last demonstrations happened in Vuƒçitrn, Uro≈°evac, Vitina and Kosovska Mitrovica, which were soon suppressed by the additional police deployment. The rioting involved 20,000 people in six cities. In late April, New York Times reported that nine people had died and more than fifty were injured. In July, New York Times reported that more than 250 had been injured. The Yugoslav press reported about 11 killed and another 4,200 were imprisoned.  Aftermath  Memorial to two of the dead Kosovo's Communist Party suffered purges, with several key figures, including its president, expelled. Veli Deva replaced Bakalli because he was thought to have been harder on Tirana. Following the demonstrations, the University of Pristina faculty and students were purged of those deemed to be \\"separatists\\". 226 students and workers were tried, convicted and sentenced to up to fifteen years in prison. Many Albanians were purged from official posts, including the president of the university and two rectors. They were replaced with Communist Party hardliners. The university was also prohibited from using textbooks imported from Albania; from then on, the university was only permitted to use books translated from Serbo-Croatian. The demonstrations also produced a growing tendency for Serbian politicians to demand centralization, the unity of Serb lands, a decrease in cultural pluralism for Albanians and an increase in the protection and promotion of Serbian culture. The university was denounced by the Serbian Communist leadership as a \\"fortress of nationalism\\". Presidency did not repeal the province's autonomy as some Serbian Communists demanded. The League of Communists of Kosovo declared the riots to be a product of Albanian nationalism, and Serbia reacted by a desire to reduce the power of the Albanians in the province, and a propaganda campaign that claimed that Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy. In 1981, it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs planned to move from Kosovo to Central Serbia after the riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards. 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by the Yugoslav Police who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material. The demonstrations in Kosovo were the beginning of a deep crisis in Yugoslavia that later led to its dissolution. The government response to the demonstrations changed the political discourse in the country in a way that significantly impaired its ability to sustain itself in the future. In literature and arts  The events inspired a novel by Albanian writer Ismail Kadare, The Wedding Procession Turned to Ice (), where he describes an Albanian physician, Teuta Shkreli, tending to the injured students. The figure of Teuta was inspired by the actions of Albanian physician Sehadete Mekuli, gynaecologist and wife of Albanian writer Esad Mekuli.

He worked quietly within many groups and organizations to attain the changes he believed necessary to advance the profession of psychiatry. Biography Sabshin was born in New York City, the son of immigrant parents from Russia. His father attained an M.D. degree in 1913 and opened his medical practice in New York. At the age of 50, he developed hypertension and moved the family to Miami Beach, Florida. Sabshin attended public schools in New York and completed high school at the age of 14. He entered the University of Florida in 1944 and graduated with a B.S. degree and a Phi Beta Kappa key. World War II was under way, he postponed going to medical school and joined the U.S. Army. He served for one year as a corpsman at a military hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana where he became acquainted with medicine. Sabshin entered Tulane University School of Medical in New Orleans, completed the program in three and one-half years, and was, academically, among the first in his class. By graduation, he had decided to go into psychiatry as he was influenced by Robert Galbraith Heath, M.D., the head of psychiatry and neurology at Tulane and studied the biochemistry of schizophrenia. Sabshin took his internship at Charity Hospital in New Orleans from 1948 to 1949 and remained there for his residency in psychiatry. During his residency, he began training in psychoanalysis. He later completed his training in Chicago at the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research and Training at the Michael Reese Hospital Medical Center where he held a research position from 1954 to 1955. He trained under Roy R. Grinker, Sr., M.D., an established leader in psychiatry who sought an integrated understanding of complex behaviors. He remained at Michael Reese Hospital Medical Center until 1961 when he became the associate director of the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research and Training. He became interested in several ideologies which were a part of psychiatry. His interests led to his belief that ideologies had to be replaced with rational, evidence-based approaches to the prevention and treatment of mental illness. Additionally, social and community psychiatry were among his interests. In 1961, Sabshin left the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research and Training to become chair of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois in Chicago. From 1967 to 1968, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Returning to Chicago, he served as the Acting Dean of the University of Illinois College of Medicine. In 1974, he left Illinois to become the medical director of the American Psychiatric Association where he remained for 23 years. He became a major influence in the growth and development of psychiatry as an evidenced-based medical discipline through the integration of multiple systems. His appointment as medical director set the stage for the gradual transformation of the profession. Working with the National Institute of Mental Health, he initially focused on training and research. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. (APPI), a publishing company, was established and Sabshin served as its first president. Over time, APPI became the largest publisher of monographs for the field of psychiatry. The American Psychiatric Association developed a new nosology based on research in psychiatry, which led to the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). These developments led to the introduction of Practice Guideline Manuals which became especially important with the widespread use of pharmacotherapy. Sabshin was actively involved in numerous psychiatric and other organizations: the Illinois Psychiatric Association (president, 1961‚Äì1962), the American College of Psychiatry (president, 1973‚Äì1974), the World Federation for Mental Health, and the World Psychiatric Association where he served as a member of its executive committee. He was particularly concerned with the abuse of psychiatry and the incarceration of dissident psychiatrists in the Soviet Union. His biography lists over 100 publications including books and chapters in books. His first publication in 1954 as a co-author was on the subject of the glucose tolerance test in schizophrenia in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. In 1966, with his colleague, Daniel Offer, M.D., he published Normality, a long term study of normal adolescents. After his retirement, APPI published his book Changing American Psychiatry: A Personal Perspective. Sabshin died in London in 2011. Works *Offer, Daniel, and Melvin Sabshin.

It was founded in 1829 and was administered by the Society of Jesus until 1990 when it was handed over to the Archdiocese of Birmingham. It is in the Baroque style, is a Grade II* listed building and was where Edward Elgar was organist from 1885.British listed buildings retrieved 10 August 2013 History Raphael's Transfiguration, a copy hangs behind the altar There was another, earlier, church built on the same site in 1729, but little is known about it. From 1623, for their own administrative purposes the Jesuits divided the country into 'residences' and St George's church was named after the 'residence' that covered Warwickshire and Worcestershire, St George's. The church was opened on 16 July 1829 by, the Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, Bishop Thomas Walsh and was designed by Henry Rowe. Later that century, in 1880 the church was extended and the facade was heightened seven years later, to the designs of S. J. Nicoll, who also designed the interior of the Jesuit staffed Church of Saint Francis Xavier in Liverpool. Behind the altar is a large-scale copy of Raphael's Transfiguration. The original is significant to the city of Worcester because it was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de' Medici in 1517. Cardinal Medici went on become the titular Bishop of Worcester from 1520 to 1522 and was elected as Pope Clement VII in 1523. The copy was presented to the church in 1837 by The 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. Organ The organ was installed in 1885, the same year that the English composer Edward Elgar became the church organist. He succeeded his father at the age of 27, being assistant organist from the age of 15. He was organist at the church for four further years. The organ was rebuilt in 1970 by Nicholson & Co (Worcester) Ltd, and the stops that were from the old organ were marked 'E' to indicate what Elgar used when he played it.Our history from StGeorgesRC-Worcester.org.uk retrieved 11 August 2013 Parish Notice board in 2011 The church has 4 Sunday Masses: Saturday Vigil at 12.30 and on Sunday at 9:00am, a Polish Mass at 2:00pm and an evening Mass at 6:00pm.

It opened in August 2014, at the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 school year. History Children in grades 9 through 12 that lived in Helena had attended nearby Pelham High School since its opening in 1974, but due to major overcrowding, the Shelby County School System and City of Helena were pressured to invest in opening a new school in Helena. As a result, in September 2010, Helena announced that a high school would be opening within city limits in the next coming years. Early expectations were for the school to open in August 2013, but those expectations were gradually pushed back to a year later. Students in the classes of 2015 and 2016 (seniors and juniors) who attended Pelham High School in the 2013‚Äì14 school year, but who lived in Helena, were given the choice to remain at Pelham High or to transfer to Helena High. Those students were required to submit their decision by December 20, 2013, and those who did not submit a decision were automatically placed in HHS. All sophomores and freshmen for the 2014‚Äì15 school year that lived in Helena were required to attend HHS. On May 16, 2013, former Chelsea High School principal Jay Peoples was named the first principal of the school. A large portion of the school's faculty and staff was hired from Pelham High School. On January 12, 2014, builders discovered vandalism, including spray-painted walls and released fire extinguishers, scattered throughout the school. Five suspects, all of whom lived in Helena and were set to attend the school, were captured and charged with third degree criminal mischief and third degree burglary by January 16. The damage was estimated to cost around $1,000. Information left The school is located on Hillsboro Parkway opposite Helena Middle School in southwestern Helena, near the Hillsboro Trail. The school's colors are silver, black and bright blue, and its nickname is the Huskies, as voted on by students and residents of Helena on November 27, 2012. In addition, the colors and mascots of the other public schools in Helena (Helena Elementary, Helena Intermediate, and Helena Middle) have been changed to concur with those of the high school. Helena High School was built on the former site of a coal mine that operated in Helena in the early 20th century, and many artifacts found by workers building the school have been preserved in the Kenneth R. Penhale City of Helena Museum, established by its namesake, Ken Penhale, the brother of former Helena mayor of 44 years, Sonny Penhale, and maintained by them and their family. The school features several modern features, including projectors in classrooms which are interactive and can be used on any wall of the classroom, and a wing of the school which includes classrooms that can double as storm shelters that, combined, can hold all students and staff at the school.

It was an equal span, two bay biplane, with straight edged, constant chord wings mounted without stagger. Unusually, the wing spars were made from tubular steel. The wings had parallel pairs of interplane struts, the inner ones with additional diagonal strut cross bracing, and bays laterally conventionally braced with diagonal flying wires. The lower wing was joined to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper wing supported over the fuselage on a pair of outward leaning N-form struts from the upper fuselage; a fully semi-circular cut-out in the upper trailing edge improved the pilot's upward vision. The B was powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh.I nine cylinder rotary engine, driving a two blade propeller and housed within a partially enclosing, oil deflecting cowling. Behind it the fuselage was flat sided. The aircraft had a conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle supported on V-form struts. The sole B built was delivered to the communications centre at Ostend. After it crashed there some parts were retrieved and used by Siemens- Schuckert in the construction of the E.II monoplane.

Stagestruck from his youth he moved from his native Rouen to Paris as a teenager to pursue a stage career. He had early success both as an actor and as a playwright. Among those with whom he collaborated as his career flourished were Sarah Bernhardt and Sacha Guitry. His career lasted for more than sixty years, and his output was prolific. As a librettist Fauchois is probably best known for writing the \\"po√®me lyrique\\" for Faur√©'s P√©n√©lope (1913). His best-known play is Prenez garde √† la peinture (1932), a comedy of bourgeois avarice, adapted for US and British stage and screen as The Late Christopher Bean. His 1919 comedy Boudu sauv√© des eaux has been filmed in both French and English. Life and career Fauchois was born in Rouen to a family of modest means. He was educated at the state schools of the city, the √©cole maternelle, √©cole communale and √©cole primaire sup√©rieure. He sang in the choir of a local church, where he developed a strong interest in ritual and religion. Determined on a theatrical career he moved to Paris as a young man, enrolling as a student at the Conservatoire national de musique et de d√©clamation. He supported himself by selling newspapers and working as a prompter at the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre. While still a student Fauchois had his first play produced. This was Le Roi des Juifs, a verse drama in five acts, which the Th√©√¢tre de l‚Äô≈íuvre staged in 1899. The following year he successfully auditioned for a small role in Edmond Rostand's play L'Aiglon, presented by and starring Sarah Bernhardt. From this beginning he made a successful career as an actor, appearing in several more productions with Bernhardt and with Mounet-Sully. He was a versatile actor, capable of playing tragic classical heroes or modern light comedy leads. As a playwright Fauchois had a series of modest successes between 1902 and 1909. His first real triumph was in 1909, a three-act verse drama called Beethoven, a portrayal of the composer's life and personality. It was translated into several languages and produced in many parts of the world. A succession of plays followed, none quite such great hits as Beethoven, but successes nevertheless. A long-term project, begun in 1907 but not complete until 1913, was an opera, P√©n√©lope, with a libretto by Fauchois and music by Gabriel Faur√©. The Faur√© scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux comments on aspects of the libretto that he regards as flawed, but Faur√© was much impressed by \\"the straightforwardness of the action and by the dignity of the characters\\".Nectoux, p. 332 The work was a success when presented at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es in Paris, but its fame was short-lived: the furore of the premiere of The Rite of Spring in the same theatre less than a month later relegated the opera to the background.Duchen, p. 179 A few years later Fauchois wrote another libretto on a classical theme: Nausicaa, to music by Reynaldo Hahn, which was premiered in 1919.\\"≈íuvres musicales\\", Reynaldo Hahn, accessed 13 August 2013 During the First World War Fauchois wrote and acted less, although three of his plays were presented at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise: La Veill√©e des armes (1915), L'Augusta and Vitrail (1916). Resuming his career as a playwright after the war he found himself typecast as the author of grand verse dramas. He struggled to establish himself as a writer of prose comedy. His Boudu sauv√© des eaux (1919), in which he played a leading role, was a succ√®s de scandale, but it was not until Sacha Guitry produced Fauchois' La Danseuse √©perdue in 1922 that the writer's gift for comedy was widely recognised. In the view of the writer Clifford Parker, Fauchois' masterpiece is Prenez garde √† la peinture (1932): The play had a long run at the Th√©√¢tre des Mathurins in Paris, and was also played in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Italy, the US and England. The American and English versions of the play are both called The Late Christopher Bean. The American adaptation was filmed in 1933 with Marie Dressler and Lionel Barrymore in the leading roles. The French film version (1932), which retains the original title, follows the action of the stage play more closely than the American and English adaptations.Parker, Clifford. \\"Ren√© Fauchois\\", The French Review, March 1938), pp. 388‚Äì395 Fauchois' career continued for nearly three decades after the success of Prenez garde √† la peinture. He wrote more than twenty further stage works, and continued to act in plays and films. Among the works of his later years was a third libretto, an operatic adaptation of Madame Bovary (1951) to music by Emmanuel Bondeville.\\"Bondeville, Emmanuel ‚Äì Works\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 13 August 2013 French Wikipedia has a complete list of Fauchois' plays.

He is best known for his upset victory in the 1983 Budweiser Million, when he became the first European horse to win the race and the first British-trained horse to win a major race in the United States for fourteen years. He recorded only one other success (in a minor event for two- year-olds) in a seventeen race career but was placed in many major European races including the 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes, Sussex Stakes, Benson and Hedges Gold Cup, Champion Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Australia with moderate results. Background Tolomeo was a big, powerful bay horse with a white star and three white socks bred in County Kildare, Ireland by the Corduff Stud. His sire Lypheor won the Prix Quincey in 1978 and showed great promise as a breeding stallion before his death at age of eleven: his other good winners included the inaugural Breeders' Cup Mile winner Royal Heroine and the Japanese champion Nippo Teio. Tolomeo was the first foal of his dam Almagest, whose only win came in a maiden at Leicester Racecourse. As a yearling, Tolomeo was offered for sale and bought for 17,000 Irish guineas by representatives of the Italian lawyer Carlo d'Alessio. who named the colt after the astronomer Ptolemy. The colt was sent to be trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Luca Cumani. Racing career =1982: two-year-old season= Tolomeo ran three times as a two-year-old in 1982, finishing second in his first two attempts before recording his first win in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. =1983: three-year-old season= After finishing fourth in the Craven Stakes on his debut as a three-year-old, Tolomeo contested the classic 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley mile course on 30 April. Ridden by the Italian jockey Gianfranco Dettori he started at odds of 18/1 against fifteen opponents. He was restrained in last place for most of the way before making rapid progress in the last quarter mile to finish second to the Irish-trained Lomond. Dettori was criticised for giving the colt too much ground to make up, but Cumani defended his jockey, insisting that he was riding according to instructions. Tolomeo next ran in The Derby over one and a half miles on soft ground, finishing ninth of the twenty-one runners, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Teenoso. Following the Derby, Tolomeo returned to shorter distances and produced three good performances without winning. He finished second by a head to Horage in the St James's Palace Stakes, third in a blanket finish for the Eclipse Stakes and second to the five-year-old Noalcoholic in the Sussex Stakes. In August, Tolomeo was one of four British-trained horses sent to Chicago for the third running of the Budweiser Million, which was then the most valuable horse race in the world. British horses had performed well in the first two runnings of the race: Madam Gay had finished third in the inaugural running, and a year later Be My Native and Motovato had finished second and third behind Perrault. The \\"home team\\" was headed by the eight-year-old John Henry, supported by Majesty's Prince, Nijinsky's Secret and Erins Isle. Tolomeo was ridden by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery and started at odds of 38/1 in a fourteen-runner field, although British bookmakers were much more cautious and made the colt the 5/1 second favourite. In a slowly run race, Eddery tracked the leaders John Henry and Nijinsky's Secret before making his challenge in the straight. When Nijinsky's Secret drifted to the right under pressure Tolomeo accelerated through a gap along the rail to take the lead and held of the late run of John Henry to win by a neck. Tolomeo's success was the first for a British-trained horse in a major American race since Karabas won the Washington, D.C. International in 1969. His win also made him the second biggest money-earner in British racing history behind the 1979 Derby winner Troy. On his return to Europe, Tolomeo ended his season with a run in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. In a race which was run in a very strong side-wind, he finished second to the filly Cormorant Wood, but was relegated to fourth for causing interference in the closing stages. =1984: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Tolomeo continued to produce good performances but was less consistent and Timeform commented that he appeared to have become \\"something of a character\\". On his first appearance of the year he finished fourth when carrying top weight in the Prince of Wales's Stakes (then a Group Two race) and then finished seventh behind Sadler's Wells in the Eclipse Stakes. In July he was moved up in distance to one and a half miles for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Ridden by his regular work-rider Rae Guest, Tolomeo produced one of his best efforts as he finished third behind Teenoso and Sadler's Wells. In August he finished second in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York, beaten two and a half lengths by Cormorant Wood. His form declined in the autumn and he finished unplaced in the Phoenix Champion Stakes and the Champion Stakes. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1983, Tolomeo was given a rating of 87, making him the fifth-best three-year-old colt in Europe behind Shareef Dancer, Caerleon, L'Emigrant and Teenoso. He was rated on 87 again in the following season, making him the fourth best older male behind Teenoso, Sagace and Morcon. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 127 in both years. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Tolomeo was sold to a syndicate of Australian breeders. He stood for one season at the British National Stud before being exported to the Goree Stud in New South Wales in 1985. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Japan. The best of his offspring were probably Innocent King, a gelding who won the Rosehill Guineas and the Australian Derby in 1993 and Daiwa Texas, who won two Group Two races and finished third in the Arima Kinen. His popularity waned in the 1990s and in 1999, his last year at stud, he sired only one foal.

Casull's passion were six-shooters, and he was determined to create a high velocity round for the .45 Colt. His goal was to achieve a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second with Colt .45 rounds fired from a single- action Army-style revolver with a inch barrel. This proved impossible due to the tensile strength of the Colt .45 cylinder, so he set out to develop his own casing and bullet. Casull began his career as a wildcat cartridge developer after having contact with Elmer Keith in the 1940s, an Idaho rancher, firearms enthusiast, and author. Keith was instrumental in the development of the first magnum revolver cartridge, the .357 Magnum, as well as the later .44 Magnum and .41 Magnum cartridges. Keith was instrumental in the development of various wildcat cartridges, a few of which were later adopted as factory rounds. Casull also worked with Oregon-based gunsmith P.O. Ackley, the famous wildcat cartridge developer. Ackley developed a family of improved wildcat cartridges by rechambering extant firearms and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. Ackley improved not only standard cartridges but was the creator of the first .17 caliber (4.5 mm) centerfire cartridge. He developed the .450 Ackley Magnum (based on a .375 H&H; Magnum case necked up to .458) and the .475 Ackley Magnum (based on a .375 H&H; Magnum necked up to .475 (12 mm)). Casull .454 cartridge Though he developed many wildcat cartridges for pistols and rifles, Casull is most famous for creating the .454 Casull cartridge in 1957 with Jack Fullmer. It was first announced in November 1959 by Guns & Ammo magazine. The basic design was a lengthened and structurally improved .45 Colt case. The wildcat cartridge finally went mainstream in 1997, when Ruger began chambering its Super Redhawk in this caliber. Taurus followed with the Raging Bull model in 1998 and the Taurus Raging Judge Magnum in 2010. Taurus also made a now-discontinued Rossi-branded R92 lever action carbine clone of the Winchester 1892 chambered for the .454 Casull.Real Guns - Rossi's R92 454 Casull, Part IITaurus - Lever Action Rifles For brush hunting and wilderness packing, the Rossi R92 carbine .454 Casull offered optional magazine-tube loading and a recoil absorbing butt pad.Guns America - discontinued Rossi 92 .454 Casull Stainless Trapper 16Rossi R92 Round Barrel 16\\" Carbine Mini Revolvers Casull began developing a mini- revolver design, which was licensed by the short-lived Rocky Mountain Arms Corp. (RMAC) of Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1971, RMAC began producing a mini- revolver chambered in .22 short. Casull's original design used a lever attached to the hammer to lock the cylinder in place. He later redesigned his mini-revolver to place the locking mechanism on the bottom of the frame, eliminating the lever attached to the hammer. He was granted U.S. Patents 4228606 and 4228608 in 1980 for the mechanism for mounting the cylinder to the frame for the cylinder locking mechanism, respectively. Freedom Arms In 1978, Casull became a partner of Wayne Baker in the Freedom, Wyoming-based Freedom Arms firearms manufacturing business to produce a 5-shot mini revolver in .22 LR known as \\"The Patriot\\". It was later offered in .22 Short and .22 WMR. A 4-shot mini revolver was also produced by Freedom Arms. The production of mini-revolvers by Freedom Arms ceased in 1990. Casull was granted U.S. Patent 4385463 in 1983 for a floating firing pin for mini revolvers and U.S. Patent 4450992 in 1984 for a belt buckle holster that would hold a mini revolver. The mini-revolver design was sold to North American Arms. =Single- Action Revolvers= Freedom Arms M83 Revolver Casull began building a number of 5-shot prototypes on Ruger Super Blackhawk frames. The Freedom Arms Model 83 single-action revolver chambered in .454 Casull was introduced in 1983. This model is still manufactured today as the Model 83. A number of variants upon the Model 83 have been produced, all with five-shot cylinders. The first was a .45 Colt in February 1986, followed closely by a .44 Magnum version. In 1991, Freedom Arms introduced the Model 252 in .22 long rifle and in 1992 the model 353 in .357 Magnum. In 1993 the Model 555 was introduced in .50 Action Express. .41 Magnum and .475 Linebaugh chamberings were introduced in 1997 and 1999 respectively. Freedom Arms introduced their own .500 Wyoming Express in the Model 83 .500 WE in 2005. The Model 97 design, with a Model 83 frame of reduced size, was introduced in 1997, originally with a six-shot .357 Magnum cylinder (.38 Special cylinder available). A five-shot .45 Colt chambering was introduced the following year, as was a five-shot .41 Magnum in 2000. Six-shot .22's are produced with .22 LR sporting and match-grade cylinders available, as well as .22 Magnum, from 2003. A five-shot .44 Special chambering came in 2004. The Model 2008, introduced in 2010, is a single-shot pistol with interchangeable barrels, most in rifle chamberings. Other gun manufacturers have since began manufacturing single-action revolvers chambered in .454 Casull. =Official Gun of Wyoming Proposal= In 2013, Wyoming State Rep. Richard Cannady (R-Glenrock) introduced a bill to make Freedom Arms Model 83 single-action revolver chambered in .454 Casull as Wyoming's official state gun.

It lies within the former municipality of Oberdorla, approximately from Niederdorla, and the site is also known by those names. The site, which includes a shallow lake, was a supra-regional cult site from the Hallstatt Period (6th century BCE) to the Migration Age (5th century CE) developed by people whose descendants became, in Friedrich Maurer's nomenclature, the Rhine-Weser Group of Teutons. It is the largest known Iron Age cult site in Central EuropeFreilichtausstellung \\"Opfermoor Vogtei\\" in Niederdorla / Th√ºringen, Urlaubsland Th√ºringen, retrieved 17 August 2013 and has yielded important information about pre- Germanic and Germanic religious practices. Excavations took place there between 1957 and 1964, and recovered artifacts and reconstructions of shrines are presented in an open-air museum on the site, which includes a reconstructed village, and an associated museum in Niederdorla. Site The site is a natural depression in which groundwater collected, forming a marsh and an area of open water roughly in extent; beginning around 100 BCE as established by studies of the sediment layers and peat, sedimentation reduced the extent of open water. Peat cutting began in 1947 and has again increased the size of the lake; the prehistoric discoveries were made during peat harvesting. Archaeological investigation Peat cutting began at the site in 1947, leading to the discovery of archaeological deposits the following year. From 1957 until 1964, the site was excavated under the leadership of G√ºnter Behm-Blancke, the director of the Museum f√ºr Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichte Th√ºringens (Museum of the Prehistory and Protohistory of Thuringia) in Weimar,Jan Bemmann and G√ºde Hahne, \\"√Ñltereisenzeitliche Heiligt√ºmer im n√∂rdlichen Europa nach den arch√§ologischen Quellen\\", in Germanische Religionsgeschichte: Quellen und Quellenprobleme, ed.

In all at least 86 distinct cultic locations have been identified on- site.Martin Kuckenburg, Kultst√§tten und Opferpl√§tze in Deutschland: Von der Steinzeit bis zum Mittelalter, Stuttgart: Theiss, 2007, , p. 102 The finds originate from various parts of Roman Germania, and are not associated with any one Germanic tribe, suggesting a cult-place serving more than the immediate region. The circular cult-place was built by the Hermunduri in the 1st century BCE and became an important religious centre during the Migration Age. The largest prehistoric settlement in Thuringia was excavated nearby at the Mallinden. The reconstructed buildings at the museum are based on examples found there. Interpretation Dating of the finds showed the site to have been used for cultic purposes from the Hallstatt Period (6th century BCE) to long after the arrival of Christianity, with isolated depositions in the 11th and 12th centuries CE. Behm-Blancke identified five different modes of sacrifice (pulverised bones scattered on the ground; carefully cleaned, entire bones either piled or buried at the lakeside, with the skull on top or placed on a pole; leg-bones placed together beside a knocked-down offering pole, or tied together, with no skull present; leg-bones and skull deposited together in the lake, presumed to have been originally the animal's hide with legs and head intact, placed on a pole; skull alone, either placed on a pole or deposited on the ground or in the lake), and distinguished bog, lake, lakeside and spring sacrifices.Bemmann and Hahne, pp. 44, 47. The cultic nature of the depositions is clear, although opinions have varied as to whether the isolated bones, particularly skulls, represent simple offerings or the remains of sacramental feasts,H. A. Groenendijk, \\"Dorfwurt Ulrum (De Marne, Prov. Groningen), eine Fundbergung im Jahre 1995 als Anregung zur Benutzung hydrologischer Messdaten bei der Erhaltung von Gro√üwurten\\", Palaeohistoria 47/48 (2005/06) 529-51, p. 539 which given the absence of some parts of the skeleton would have taken place elsewhere.Behm-Blancke, \\"Kult und Ideologie\\", p. 367. =Hallstatt Period= The religious centre of the site in the early period is a rectangular altar of Muschelkalk limestone surrounded by a semicircular wall made of rocks and earth. Vessels containing food offerings were placed on the altar and a fire was lit. Buds on the charcoal remnants of the wood indicate a springtime ritual, likely in honour of a vegetation deity. The altar is comparable to contemporary and older finds in the northwestern Alps and to early Greek altars. Beside the altar was a circular shrine surrounded by a wall, in the centre of which was an image in the form of a stele; goats and other animals had been sacrificed there. There are also small oval sacrificial sites marked off by rocks or branches, dating to the late Hallstatt Period. Some of these contained simple wooden idols, one of which had a decorated neck-ring. A large loom weight indicated a female divinity. Painted pottery shows typological kinship with Rhineland examples. =La T√®ne Period= Reconstruction of a sod altar with bovine skull and pole idol During the middle and late La T√®ne Period, a small lake developed at the site, and over centuries became the focus of sacrifice there: numerous wooden idols of varying form were set up at the edge of the water until the Migration Period. Cultic observances continued in the late Migration Age after the lake shrank as a result of sedimentation. During the La T√®ne Period, the descendants of the Hallstatt Period inhabitants were affected by Celtic cultural influences. Apsoidal enclosures, as are found for example in the Trier temple area, became common. These enclosed altars made of blocks of sod or soil supported by wickerwork, with a tall post or a simple stick-figure cult image on the top. Cultic staffs used by the priests were associated with the altars. After a short time this Celtic-influenced arrangement was superseded by a \\"sacred place\\" with a phallus and a female forked-stick cult figurine--although Rudolf Simek has pointed out that fragmentary figurines from this site are in some cases interpreted as female on the basis of long hair and/or clothing, which may not have been so intended.Simek, p. 45. These represent cult places of Germanic migrants, whose pottery indicates that they came from the area of the rivers Oder and Warta. =Germanic Period= 1st century BCE The Hermunduri appeared in northern Thuringia at the end of the 1st century BCE. They created a large circular cultic area at the site, with small enclosures, which also contained cultic posts and an image made from a forked stick. The cultic area underwent two periods of construction. At its centre was a large rectangular wooden altar with corner posts; numerous bones from sacrificed animals were found near it. Skull fragments from human sacrifices were found on the western edge of the cultic area. On its northern side were two unusual sacrificial sites with a sword set upright in the ground and a human skull. Tacitus mentions a conflict between the Hermunduri and the Chatti on the River Werra as having taken place at about this time. After the battle, which was won by the Hermunduri, sacrifices continued at the lake site. Roman Period During the mid-Roman Period, use of the site focused on the veneration of various deities distinguished by their idols and attributes, which took place in shared circular shrines. In the 3rd century CE, this format was superseded by a single shrine, in which a wooden cult image of a goddess was placed near the altar.Photograph of the idol Plate 40a, Bruno Kr√ºger, et al., ed., Die Germanen, Volume 2, facing p. 257. A sowilo rune found on a vessel may indicate her name. The figure shows Gallo-Roman influence and may be compared to Diana, to whom deer and swine were also sacrificed. A craftsmen's settlement at Haarhausen (Amt Wachsenburg) and sacrifices of oxen and offerings at the cemetery in Ha√üleben indicate influence on the Hermunduri via workers from the region of the Roman Limes. The shrine contained a coffin with a female skeleton inside; the grave was destroyed in the 4th century, possibly during the disturbances associated with the formation of the Thuringii. Migration Age Recreation of 5th- century ship shrine In the 5th century, two ship shrines were created at the site. The larger was formed of branches with a hole indicating the steering oar and was associated with a male divinity, who was represented by a tall post idol surmounted by a horse's head. The smaller ship shrine had a sacrifice of cattle and was dedicated to a goddess. Ship shrines are also attested from earlier periods. In the late Migration Age, the site was a major sacrificial location. Several offerings were found within, but no idols. At some point, the enclosure was destroyed by fire. Medieval Period The archaeological evidence does not support continuous use after the early Holy Roman Empire,Jan Bemmann, \\"Mitteldeutschland im 5. und 6. Jahrhundert. Was ist und ab wann gibt es arch√§ologisch betrachtet typisch Th√ºringisches? Eine kritische Bestandsaufnahme\\", in Die Fr√ºhzeit der Th√ºringer: Arch√§ologie, Sprache, Geschichte, ed.

Heathen observances died out after the foundation of the Archdiaconate of Oberdorla, which was probably a response to the presence of the widely important heathen site.Seyer, pp. 254-55. Significance of finds With the assistance of comparative research and of evidence from older discoveries relating to religious practices in Europe, the finds at the site have contributed to new understanding of cult practices in the region in the Hallstatt, La T√®ne, Roman and Migration Ages, including: * Construction and form of shrines, including enclosures and evidence of huts which may have sheltered the cult imagesBehm-Blancke, \\"Kult und Ideologie\\", p. 369. * Types of offering poles and cult imagesBehm-Blancke, \\"Kult und Ideologie\\", pp. 369-71. * Ritual tools, particularly hammers or axes and clubsBehm-Blancke, \\"Kult und Ideologie\\", p. 371; Plate 55 (between pages 400 and 401). * Animal sacrifice to male and female divinities (including specific issues such as the incidence of horse sacrificeHeinrich Beck, \\"Pferdegr√§ber\\", in Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, Volume 23 Pfalzel - Quaden, ed.

The extensive preserved material at the site also provide valuable information about diet, animal husbandry, and material culture. In particular, the large numbers of well-preserved animal remains are an important source of information on the nature and size of domesticated animals during the periods when they were sacrificed,Manfred Teichert, \\"Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung im 1. und 2.

The museum offers periodic presentations and classes in ancient Germanic clothing, weaponry, cookery and baking, spinning and weaving, and games. A Germanic festival and a Roman market take place on-site in alternating years, with costumed living history reenactors seeking to recreate everyday life in one or the other context. Neo-Pagans have also held rituals at the site.\\"Sommersonnenwendfeier am Opfermoor\\", Deutschland Today, 14 June 2011 In addition, the district museum in M√ºhlhausen, the Museum am Lindenb√ºhl, has an exhibit about the site, and G√ºnter Behm-Blanke's papers and some of the discoveries from the site are in the Museum f√ºr Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichte Th√ºringens in Weimar.

He was noted as being the \\"Master Showman of Nassau County.\\"Justa Nuther, Just Some More, Hempstead Sentinel, July 27, 1933  Early life  Calderone was born in Sicily, Italy and came to America in 1893 to work as a newspaperman. He was employed first by the New Orleans newspaper, The Picayune, and six years later in 1899 came to New York City to work for the newspaper, Il Progresso. During this period of his life he was also known as having an interest in a California fruit producing enterprise.Church Rites Held for S. Calderone, Theatre Magnate, The Hempstead Sentinel, February 14, 1929; and S. Calderone Dies, Owner of Theatres, New York Times, February 11, 1929  Entry into the Theater Business  He became interested in the theater business, and in 1907 partnered with his brother to acquire and manage the first of a number of theaters located in the lower part of Manhattan. In 1910 his theater located at 331 Bowery was badly damaged in a fire that broke out in the upper floors of the building it occupied.Fire Near Picture Show, New York Sun, 1910 (no month or day noted) The brothers built up a successful enterprise, acquiring several movie houses which they managed until the outbreak of World War I, when attendance dropped off enough for them to end their interests in the theater business of New York City.Church Rites Held for S. Calderone, Theatre Magnate, The Hempstead Sentinel, February 14, 1929  Expansion  Not long after the war began in 1914, Calderone decided to leave New York City, and came to Hempstead, located in Nassau County, Long Island, where he acquired the Strand Theatre, located on Front Street. This new enterprise prospered under his management and he soon decided that Hempstead and the surrounding villages of that part of Long Island retained great promise for an expansion of the movie theater business. Along with other prominent individuals he formed a corporation named the \\"Calderone Corporation\\" that built the first big movie house, named the Hempstead Theatre, which was built c. 1920.Plans $250,000 Local Theatre, Hempstead Sentinel, April 8, 1920; and Charter Company for Hempstead Theatre, Hempstead Sentinel, November 11, 1920 With this success, Calderone and his partners either built or acquired a number of other theaters within a very short period of time, quickly becoming the largest movie theater chain located in Nassau County. Like so many other theater owners and managers, Calderone was in favor of allowing his theaters to open up for showings on Sunday, which was against the law in New York State in the 1920s. He, along with several other Long Island theater owners, were indicted for breaking the law and showing movies or theatrical performances on a Sunday during the spring of 1923.Suspend Sentence on Theatre Men, Hempstead Sentinel, June 21, 1923; and Five Managers Indicted After Sunday Shows, Brooklyn Standard Union, March 24, 1923 All involved plead guilty except Calderone, against whom the charges were dismissed, while the others received suspended sentences, however popular momentum was with the theater owners. A few years later, local municipalities on Long Island began using their power to let theaters show movies on Sundays - which was allowable under the parameters of the state law. Calderone's St. James Theatre, located in St. James, Suffolk County, Long Island, began showing films on Sundays in 1930.Port Jefferson Echo, May 15, 1930 & July 24, 1931 By 1927, the Calderone chain operated more than half-a-dozen theaters in Nassau County, including two in Hempstead, one in Lynbrook, one in Valley Stream, one in Glen Cove, one in Westbury, and one in Mineola. Calderone soon became \\"...a powerful figure in the theatrical field...,\\" and acted as the guiding hand behind the chain. During the late summer of 1927 unionized workers threatened to strike against Calderone if they did not receive higher wages, while other nearby theater owners agreed to the unions demands, Calderone refused, and the strike ensued.L.I. Stage Hands Win Wage Boost on Strike Threat, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, August 31, 1927; and Ruling Frees Jailed Striker, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, December 13, 1928 From late 1928 through early 1929, Calderone entered into negotiations to sell his five large Nassau County theaters to the Fox Theatres Corporation. The negotiated price was said to have been $3 million.  Movies vs. Vaudeville  During the period of Salvatore Calderone's management of his theater chain (called during his day the 'Calderone Theatre Circuit') he aggressively promoted films and vaudeville acts. Each of his theaters could accommodate both genres, and allowed Calderone to offer an immense variety of acts. Nearly every act would be booked across one or more theaters in the chain, moving from one community to another, as was noted in many advertisements during the 1920s. African American performers, who were usually part of revues or cabarets, were featured regularly.Lucky Sambo at the Rivoli Today, Hempstead Sentinel, May 20, 1926 Calderone's Rivoli Theatre in Hempstead was advertised as featuring \\"Vaudeville Always.\\" Rivoli Theatre Advertisement, Hempstead Sentinel, April 1, 1926  Death  Salvatore Calderone had been having health problems before he suffered a heart attack in the early morning of Sunday, February 10, 1929 at his home at 80 Terrace Avenue, Hempstead, Long Island. Dr. Benjamin Seaman was called to the home where Calderone died at 5:30 in the morning surrounded by his family. At the time of his death local newspapers remarked \\"His life is an example of what can be accomplished by those who come to America from other places. It shows that opportunities are always here for those who are ready to seize them.Chain Movie Builder of Nassau Dead, Long Island Daily Press, February 11, 1929; and Hempstead Sentinel, February 14, 1929 His funeral service was held at Our Lady of Loretto on Greenwich Street in Hempstead on Tuesday, February 12, 1929, followed by burial at Calvary Cemetery. His immediate survivors included his wife, Rosario Calderone, and sons Frank (who helped run the chain), Roy, and Anthony. While his death announcement notes Calderone was buried in Calvary Cemetery, at some point his body was removed to Greenfield Cemetery, located in Uniondale, Nassau County, Long Island, New York, where he was re-interred in an elegant mausoleum.  Legacy  While many sources indicate the Calderone chain was sold to Fox in 1929, it appears that Salvatore Calderone's death put an end to that plan as the theater chain remained in operation for many years after his death. His son, Dr. Frank A. Calderone (1901 - 1987), who was an expert on preventive medicine and a leading early figure in the World Health Organization, continued to operate many of the theaters created by his father until around 1980.Calderone Theatres Collection, Special Collections Department/Long Island Studies Institute, Hofstra University c.1920-1990, http://www.hofstra.edu/PDF/lib_sc_Calderone_Theatre_Collection_fa.pdf; and Dr. Frank A. Calderone, New York Times, February 24, 1987 In addition to those located in Nassau County, the company also owned and operated theaters in neighboring Suffolk County. During Salvatore Calderone's life, the company built and managed most of its theaters. After his death, the company appears to have begun leasing out the theaters to other management chains, as Frank Calderone left the management of the company to others and did not return to an active role until 1954.Dr. Frank A. Calderone, New York Times, February 24, 1987 According to Rob Boehm of cinematreasures.org, \\"The Cove, Rivoli and Calderone were operated by Skouras. The Valley Stream and Lynbrook by Century. UA succeeded Skouras and Century folded. The Valley Stream operated as the Rio for a time before it was demolished. The Lynbrook went over to UA.\\"Email correspondence with Rob Boehm of cinematreasures.org, August 2013  Calderone Theatre & Concert Hall  The chain opened one of their most expensive theaters in June 1949 in Hempstead, Long Island. Named the \\"Calderone Theatre,\\" it was designed by William Lescaze (1896‚Äì1969) one of the pioneers of modernism in American architecture and cost $2 million and seated 2,500 people. At the time of its dedication, a plaque was erected in the new theater honoring Salavatore Calderone and his work in founding the chain that bore his name.$2,000,000 Theater Opens in Hempstead, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, June 1949 The Calderone Theatre eventually became the Calderone Concert Hall, which required the installation of a stage as it was the only Calderone theater not to have one at the outset. Due to its fine acoustics, it was sought after as a performance venue for leading bands and musicians. The Calderone family sold the hall in 1982 to Rana Management who planned to renovate the building.Buyer to Revive Calderone, Newsday, March 30, 1982 Performers who played at the hall during the 1970s and 1980s included Santana (at least four times) , Fleetwood Mac>, ZZ Top, Aerosmith, Jerry Garcia, Gentle Giant, and Rainbow.https://books.google.com/books?id=KCUEAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PT78&lpg;=PT78&dq;=calderone+concert+hall; and /http://cinematreasures.org/ In the 1990s it was converted into a seven- screen multiplex cinema.

This theater was under the management of Calderone until just shortly before his death when it was turned back over to its owners who sold it in 1930.Mineola Theatre Sold, New York Evening Post, March 4, 1930 It replaced an older theater that dated back to at least 1916. At some point after 1930 it returned to the chain and remained part of it until c. 1980-1982 when it was sold.Live Theatre to Go On, Long Island Star-Journal, December 13, 1961; and Buyer to Revive Calderone, Newsday, March 30, 1982; and /http://cinematreasures.org/ It has since been demolished and replaced by an office building. * Rivoli Theatre, c. 1925 ‚Äì 1926, 145 Main Street, Hempstead, Nassau County, NY. At the time ground was broken, this theater was called the 'Up Town' but was renamed the Rivoli by the time it opened on April 3, 1926. Sources vary on whether it was designed by Douglas Pairman Hall or Harrison G. Wiseman (1878‚Äì1945). The theater was later rechristened the \\"Calderone II\\" and in 1978 was donated by Frank Calderone to Adelphi University when it became the Adelphi Calderone Theatre (ACT).

It closed in June 1922 after Calderone's new theater opened, and it remained closed apparently due to building violations, but Calderone indicated he might re-open it if the issues could be resolved. It did eventually reopen, however it closed again in April 1926. The reason given was that it was showing second run films and losing money. By the end of 1928 the building was being used as the branch office of the Salvation Army.Strand Theatre Closes, Hempstead Sentinel, April 22, 1926; and May Reopen Strand Theatre, Hempstead Sentinel, May 3, 1923; and Strand Theatre Closes, Hempstead Sentinel, June 22, 1922; and Hempstead Sentinel, December 20, 1928. * Valley Stream Theatre, c. 1925, 69 Rockaway Avenue, Valley Stream, Nassau County, NY.

History  Rabbi Amram Aburbeh began the project of building a new Synagogue to accommodate the growing number of Ma‚Äôaraviim Maghrebi Jewish families that were exiting the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem and settling in newer neighborhoods. He approached Don Yamin Ben Harroch, who headed the Jewish community in Melilla, Spain, and was known for his philanthropy. The project appealed to Ben Harroch, so he agreed to contribute funds to enable the construction. Cornerstone laying ceremony for the Or Zaruaa synagogue on October 26, 1926. On Tuesday, October 26, 1926, (18 Cheshvan 5687 Jewish calendar) the cornerstone laying ceremony for the Synagogue building took place in the Nachalat Ahim neighbourhood. At 3 pm the celebration started with the Beit Chinuch Ivrim (The Blind School) youth orchestra. Several leaders of the Jewish communities in Jerusalem were invited to be present. There were the Rabbis representing Sephardi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews. Among them were Rabbis Shmuel Azran, Harav Hanazir-Rabbi David Ha-Cohen, Harlap, Ovadia Hadaya, Shimon Ashriki, and Shmuel Allaluf. The speaker at the ceremony was Avraham Elmalih, a representative of the Ma‚Äôaraviim committee. The first stone was placed by Rabbi Nissim Elishar, followed by the other guests. Amram Aburbeh insisted that only Jewish workers would be permitted to work on the building. Rabbi Amram Aburbeh headed the Or Zaruaa synagogue since its inception in 1926 till 1951 when he was elected to be Chief Rabbi in Petah Tikva, Israel.  Activities  The new synagogue was inaugurated in 1927. Amram Aburbeh, the official owner of the Synagogue, served as its Rabbi. For a few years he was a resident in an apartment designated for him and his family on the first floor of the building until he built a house nearby. The apartment then became the residence of Haim Kobi, the Gabai of the Synagogue, and his family for the next 40 years. Or Zaruaa served as a Synagogue as well as a Beit Midrash, where lessons were taught. The Synagogue congregation participated for several years in Tzedakah, or charity activities, such as a donation in 1931 to the Misgav Ladach Jewish Hospital in Jerusalem. Or Zaruaa Synagogue Jerusalem donation by HaRav Amram Aburbeh to Misgav Ladach Hospital, 1931 Amram Aburbeh asked each member of Or Zaruaa Synagogue to donate and contribute even a small amount of coins to support the Misgav Ladach Hospital. Among the list of family names, it is evident that the members were of many origins (Yemenite, Eini family; the Tzdaka family from Aleppo, Syria; the Abulafia family from Gallipoli, Turkey; the Mizrachi from Iraq; Iran; Bukhara, Uzbekistan). Rabbi Amram Aburbeh was nominated the Chief Rabbi of the Nachlaot neighborhood in Jerusalem by the Chief Rabbi of Eretz Israel, Ha'Rishon Le-Tzion, Rabbi Ben- Zion Meir Hai Uziel. Or Zaruaa Synagogue served as an voting locations during the elections in January 1931.  Connections to other synagogues  Between 1925 and 1927 Yamin Ben Harroch also allocated money for the construction of another Synagogue in his home town of Melilla, Spain, where Enrique Nieto designed the building. This Synagogue was also named Or Zaruaa.Noach Klinger article: Melilla, the far brothers (In Spanish: Melilla los hermanos lejanos) Both Or Zaruaa Synagogues also resemble each other in several aspects of their interior design, such as the high ceilings, the marble stone walls with engraved dedications, colored stained glass tall curved windows, the ladies gallery (ezrat nashim) design and the unique multiple illuminating chandeliers. The chandeliers, originally from Italy, are still present in both synagogues, although they are now electric. The chandeliers gave the name Or Zaruaa a special meaning since \\"Or\\" in Hebrew means \\"light\\".

It is often also referred to as Sundbyerne (plural form) since a distinction is traditionally made between Sundbyvester (Sundby West) and Sundby√∏ster (Sundby East), located on each their side of Amagerbrogade. History Sundbyvester and Sundby√∏ster in 1865 =Early history= Sundbyvester (Sundby occidentali) and Sundby√∏ster (Sundby orientali) were originally two villages known from about 1100. They consisting of two rows of farmsteads extending from Amager Road, now Amagerbrogade, roughly where present day √òresundsvej and Englandsvej are found today, separating their farm land to the south from their pastures to the north. In the second half of the 18th century, the area changed character when sailors, craftsmen and workers began to settle in the community which spread along the main road. Administratively, Sundby belonged to the civil parish of T√•rnby. In 1793, the northnmost part of the area, Amagerbro, was transferred to Copenhagen whose so-called Demarcation Line, which heavily restricted construction within a certain distance from the city walls, kept development to a minimum. =19th century= Up through the 19th century, Sundby became home to an increasing number of manufacturies and workshops, often from Christianshavn, which moved out of the city in search of more room in the face of increasing industrialization. An early example of this was Jacob Holm, who purchased several pieces of land on both sides of the main road between 1808 and 1812, establishing both a smock mill operating an oil-press, a glue manufactury and a rope walk on it. The differences between urban Sundby and rural T√•rnby grew still larger and led to conflicts over matters such as schools, sewers and street maintenance. In the 1890 census, Sundbyerne had a population of 13,310. In 1895 when Sundby was finally disjoined from T√•rnby. =20th century= A street in Sundby, probably Islandsgade, painted 1923 by Johan Rohde Sundby's status as an independent civil parish (sognekommune) only lasted for seven years. Its population skyrocketed in the years around 1900 when many workers moved to the area from Copenhagen, and it was from the beginning faced with economic, social and sanitary challenges, leading to its merger into Copenhagen in 1902.

Life  From 1804 until 1808 Fink studied theology at the University of Leipzig where he joined the Corps Lusatia. There he made his first attempts at composition and poetry. Most of his song compositions are attributed to this period. From 1811 he held the office of vicar in Leipzig for some years, where he also founded an educational institution which he led until 1829. Since the beginning of the 19th century he worked for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitschrift (\\"General musical magazine\\"). In 1827 he became the magazine's editor-in-chief, a position he held for 15 years. From 1838 Fink worked as a lecturer at the University of Leipzig. In 1841 he became a Privatdozent of musicology at the university. In the same year he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin and a year later he was appointed the music director of the university. Fink was highly appreciated throughout his life as a music theorist and composer. Numerous honors and awards were bestowed on him at home as well as abroad. In 1838, the Faculty of Philosophy at Leipzig University awarded him an honorary doctorate. His compositions consist mainly of songs, song collections, and ballads.

From early times and particularly in medieval Europe the consumption of grains containing ergot has repeatedly lead to mass poisonings known as ergotism which was caused by toxic ergot alkaloids and mycotoxins such as the ergochromes, due to contamination of flour by C. purpurea. A cluster of genes responsible for the synthesis of secalonic acids in C. purpurea has been identified. Secalonic acid D the enantiomer of secalonic acid A is a major environmental toxin, isolated from the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, and is a major microbial contaminant of freshly-harvested corn which causes toxicity through contamination of foodstuffs. File:Secalonic acid A or ergochrome AA.svgSecalonic acid A File:Secalonic acid B or ergochrome BB.svgSecalonic acid B File:Secalonic acid C or ergochrome AB.svgSecalonic acid C File:Secalonic acid D or ergochrome EE.svgSecalonic acid D File:Ergoflavin.svgErgoflavin File:Ergochrysin A.svgErgochrysin A Occurrence In addition to the occurrence in C. purpurea the secalonic acids A, B, D and ergoflavin have also been isolated from other fungi, and the three secalonic acids have also been found in various lichens. To date at least twenty-two members of the ergochrome family have been isolated and structurally identified, including secalonic acid E (the enantiomer of secalonic acid A) from the fungus Phoma terrestris, secalonic acid F from the fungus Aspergillus aculeatus, and secalonic acid G from the fungus Pyrenochaeta terrestris. In addition the monomeric units of the dimeric secalonic acids, namely hemisecalonic acids B, and E (blennolides A and E) have been isolated from Blennoria sp., an endophytic fungus from Carpobrotus edulis.  Bioactivity The secalonic family of secondary metabolite mycotoxins exhibit interesting bioactivities. Secalonic acid A has antitumor properties and also reduces colchicines toxicity in rat cortical neurons. In addition, it has been demonstrated that secalonic acid A protects against dopaminergic neuron death in a Parkinson's disease mouse model. Secalonic acid B also has antitumor activity. When tested against B16 murine melanoma it was found to be active in the low micromolar range. It also proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium) and the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and was found to be antifungal against (Microbotryum violaceum) and antialgal against (Chlorella fusca). Secalonic acid D (SAD) is a toxic and teratogenic metabolite. Teratogenic effects were observed in the development of rats that were exposed to SAD injected during fetal development. SAD exhibited potent cytotoxicity on multidrug resistance (MDR) cells and their parental cells. Investigation of the antitumor activity of SAD showed that it exerted potent cytotoxic activity on SP cells, due to induction of ABCG2 degradation by calpain-1 activation. Ergoflavin showed good anti-inflammatory activity and good anticancer activities including significant inhibition of proliferation particularly in pancreatic, renal, and lung cancer cells, and may be exerting its effects via mechanisms similar to those of secalonic acid D.  Structure Ergoflavin was first isolated in pure form from Claviceps purpurea (ergot) in 1958. It was shown to be a 2,2‚Äô- biaryl linked dimer in 1963 and the structure confirmed that year by single-crystal X-ray analysis. During the following decade the structures of secalonic acids A, B, C, D and ergochrysin A were similarly firmly established, and although there was some early contention whether they were 2,2‚Äô-, 4,4‚Äô- or even 2,4‚Äô-linked it was confirmed that they too were all 2,2‚Äô- linked between the biphenyl residues. In all known secalonic acids, the methyl and methoxycarbonyl substituents are found to be trans to each other, and X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of secalonic acid A showed that the 2,2‚Äô-biaryl linkage was nonplanar and the angle between the two biphenyl planes was 36.5¬∞. Isomerisation of 2,2‚Äô-, 2,4‚Äô-, and 4,4‚Äô-linked Secalonic acid A The tetrahydroxanthone-containing secalonic acids have been demonstrated to be unstable under basic conditions, and they can easily undergo isomerizations arising from ether linkage replacement. The 2-2‚Äôlinked secalonic acid A isomerizes in DMSO at room temperature to the 2-4‚Äôlinked secalonic acid A and 4-4‚Äôlinked secalonic acid A during 13hr, to reach an equilibrium of 3.2 : 2 : 1. This isomerisation goes faster in the presence of base (DMSO/pyridine).  Synthesis The common key feature in the synthesis of ergoflavin and the secalonic acids is the biaryl dimerisation of protected iodo-aryl monomers with Cu or Pd. Whalley‚Äôs synthesis of ergoflavin 3 from hemiergoflavin 1 in 1971 was achieved by a low yield coupling of two protected 2-iodo-hemiegoflavin monomers 2 with copper under the Ullmann reaction conditions, followed by acid deprotection. Synthesis of Ergoflavin via dimerisation 2-iodo-hemiegoflavin monomers Similarly more than forty years later Porco‚Äôs synthesis of the more labile secalonic acid D in 60% yield involved coupling two protected iodo monomers via their stannes with CuCl at room temperature, whereas Tietze achieved a similar synthesis of secalonic acid E by coupling two protected iodo monomers with Pd (OAc)2under Suzuki conditions at 70 ¬∞C in 85% yield.

Stand Dynamics  As with temperate rainforests elsewhere, fire has relatively less of an influence compared to many other forest types, such as the subalpine of the Western US or the boreal forests. Instead, wind and insects are more important. Small scale gap dynamics are common, as rainfall and storms combine to cause substantial uprooting of individual and small groups of trees. Widespread windstorms occur with some regularity (e.g. less time between events than the lifespan of dominant treesNagal, Levanic, and Diaci. 2007. A dendrochronological reconstruction of disturbance in an old-growth Fagus-Abies forest in Slovenia.) and cause extensive gap formation, although not complete mortality over large areas. It is difficult to determine large scale disturbance dynamics, however, due to the few areas that have not been extensively modified by humans.  Examples  The Biogradska Gora National Park, in Montenegro, is typical of this region. The unprotected remainder has been subject to extensive forestry and coppicing, although a substantial portion remains Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ed. DellaSala. Chapter 6.

The benefit has been questioned in scientific studies. The typeface was created by Abelardo Gonzalez, who released it through an open-source license. The design is based on DejaVu Sans, also an open-source font. Like many dyslexia-intervention typefaces, most notably Dyslexie, OpenDyslexic adds to dyslexia research and is a reading aid. It is not a cure for dyslexia. The typeface includes regular, bold, italic, bold-italic, and monospaced font styles. In 2012, Gonzalez explained his motivation to the BBC: \\"I had seen similar fonts, but at the time they were completely unaffordable and so impractical as far as costs go.\\"  Scientific studies  Two studies have investigated the effect of specialized fonts used with students with dyslexia. Rello and Baeza-Yates (2013) measured eye-tracking recordings of Spanish readers (aged 11‚Äì50) with dyslexia and found that OpenDyslexic did not significantly improve reading time nor shorten eye fixation. In her master's thesis, Leeuw (2010) compared Arial and Dyslexie with 21 Dutch students with dyslexia and found Dyslexie did not lead to faster reading, but may help with some dyslexic-related errors. The British Dyslexia Association recommend ‚Äúplain, evenly spaced sans serif font such as Arial and Comic Sans. Alternatives include Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, Trebuchet‚Äù instead of fonts like OpenDyslexic or Dyslexie.  Integration  The typeface is currently an optional choice on many websites and formats, including Wikipedia, Instapaper, Kobo eReader, Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, a few children's books, and at least one imprint of classic literature. There is also a Google Chrome extension available, which was developed by Abelardo Gonzalez and Robert James Gabriel. It is also part of the \\"dyslexia-friendly mode\\" in Oswald Foundation's web accessibility products.

As an early and influential member of ACT UP, New York, he founded both the Treatment Action Group (TAG) and the educational website AIDSmeds.com. Staley is a primary figure in the Oscar-nominated documentary How to Survive a Plague. Early life and education Peter Staley was born in Sacramento, California, in 1961; the third of four children. His father was a plant manager for Procter & Gamble. Their family moved throughout the US until he was eight when his family moved to Berwyn, Pennsylvania, when his father was hired to run the PQ Corporation, based in Philadelphia. He attended Oberlin College after first studying classical piano at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music for a semester. He majored in economics and government, spending his junior year abroad at the London School of Economics before graduating from Oberlin in 1983. Following his graduation, he went to work for J.P. Morgan, where his brother Jes Staley was working (Jes became the CEO of J.P. Morgan's Investment Bank, before leaving in 2013 to join BlueMountain Capital and is now the CEO of Barclays). Activism =Involvement with ACT UP= After observing similarities with the symptoms depicted in the made-for-TV drama An Early Frost, Staley consulted with his physician, Dr. Dan William, who diagnosed Staley with AIDS- Related Complex (ARC) in 1985. In 1987, after being handed a flyer on his way to work prior to the first demonstration by ACT UP (AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power), he decided to attend the next meeting. Although he had come out to his family, Staley remained closeted at work, working as a bond trader by day and chairing ACT UP's fundraising operations by night, before coming out at work and going on disability leave. On March 24, 1988, he took part in an ACT UP demonstration on Wall Street on the first anniversary of the group. At that demonstration, he was in one of the first waves of people sitting in the street to block traffic, and was interviewed by a local TV station who broadcast his image with the caption \\"Peter Staley, AIDS victim.\\" On April 25, 1989, Staley and three other activists barricaded themselves in an office at Burroughs Wellcome in Research Triangle Park, NC to protest the price of AZT (at the time priced at $8,000-$10,000 per year). The four protesters used power tools to bolt metal plates to the door of an unoccupied office and had planned to drop a banner that would be visible from the nearby highway, Interstate 40, before authorities cut their way through a wall. The protestors then chained themselves together, and were cut apart and charged with trespassing and property damage. Staley, who at the time had been in talks with AZT developer David Barry to lower the price on the drug, would make peace with the company years later, following their $1 million donation to AIDS clinical trials programs in 1992. On September 14, 1989, Staley and six other activists staged another demonstration to protest the rising cost of AZT, this time in the New York Stock Exchange. Dressed in suits and carrying fake credentials, they chained themselves to a balcony above the trading floor before unfurling a banner that read \\"Sell Wellcome\\", drowned out the opening bell with airhorns, and dropped fake $100 bills that read, \\"Fuck your profiteering. We die while you play business.\\" on the traders below. Within days, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT by 20%. In 1989, he was part of a group that stormed the Fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal, at the time a members-only event for doctors and HIV/AIDS researchers. They took over seats reserved for dignitaries, and released their first Treatment and Data report calling for speedier access to AIDS drugs, although coverage of the demonstration was overshadowed by the events at Tiananmen Square. The next year, Staley was a featured speaker at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS in 1990, held in San Francisco. Staley would be involved in many more demonstrations and protests, ultimately being arrested 10 times, although he does not have a criminal record due to the work of pro bono lawyers. =Involvement with TAG= In 1991, Staley founded an ACT UP activist affiliate called TAG (which originally stood for Treatment Action Guerrillas, and later Treatment Action Group). Formed from ACT UP's Treatment and Data Committee, the group was focused on actively working to pursue AIDS treatment solutions through activism, and working with groups that had been targeted by ACT UP, such as pharmaceutical companies. As an event to launch the birth of the group, Staley draped a giant condom over the home of North Carolina Republican Senator Jesse Helms on September 5, 1991, protesting the position the senator had taken on AIDS-related issues. The side of the giant nylon condom replica read \\"A condom to stop unsafe politics - Helms is deadlier than a virus.\\" After police arrived, the group stopped the protest, and helped remove the condom. No one was arrested, and Helms decided not to press charges. Years later, Staley would reveal that the stunt had been funded by David Geffen. TAG broke away from ACT UP to focus on protesting government agencies on working for faster drug solutions through more coordinated AIDS research efforts. At the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam, the group called for negotiations and more proactive measures than protests in order to achieve those goals. Staley later said that he regretted the split, wishing that they had been \\"able to keep it together as an organization.\\" =amfAR= From 1991-2004, Staley served on the board for amfAR (the Foundation for AIDS Research). A nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting HIV/AIDS research, prevention, and treatment education, the group has invested more than $366 million in its various programs over the course of its history, which have spawned significant advances in the realm of the treatment and prevention of HIV. During this time, he was named to President Bill Clinton's AIDS National Task Force on AIDS Drug Development, an 18-member panel of scientists, doctors and AIDS advocates to work to speed the research for new AIDS drugs. In October 2000, he was honored by the organization as the recipient of their Award of Courage. =AIDSmeds.com= In 1999, Staley founded AIDSmeds.com, a site \\"dedicated to providing people living with HIV the necessary information they need to make empowered treatment decisions.\\" It expanded to include topics including gay health, and education and resources related to gay health. In 2006, AIDSmeds.com merged with POZ, a publication for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Staley is still with the merged organization as a blogger and advisory editor. =Ad campaign against crystal meth= In 2004, Staley funded and launched an ad campaign in New York, warning of the link between crystal meth use and HIV in gay and bisexual men. A former crystal meth addict himself, Staley had ads placed on phone booths along Eighth Avenue in Chelsea that read \\"Huge Sale! Buy Crystal, Get HIV Free!\\" The controversial ads attracted attention from both supporters and detractors. =How to Survive a Plague= Staley features prominently in the 2012 documentary How to Survive a Plague, which depicts the early years of the AIDS epidemic and the actions of ACT UP and TAG. For the film, director David France relied heavily on archival footage, much of it taken from VHS tapes in Staley's personal collection. The documentary was nominated for an Oscar. It also received awards for the best documentary of 2012 from the Gotham Independent Film Awards and from the Boston Society of Film Critics, and was nominated for best documentary at the Film Independent Spirit Awards. In addition, the film was nominated for a Directors Guild Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary. Personal life Staley and his partner, along with their dog, divide their time between rural Pennsylvania and an apartment in New York City's West Village, not far from where ACT UP first recruited him. https://www.newsweek.com/2018/08/24/learning-how-overcome-pessimism-key- activism-says-aids-rights-activist-1069099.html Controversy According to the New York Times, \\"The Sanders campaign‚Äôs policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn‚Äôt really deserve to be called an 'activist,' Gunnels claimed that Staley had 'made a fortune from big drug companies.' As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of 'shilling for big Pharma' and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. 'In short,' the post concluded, 'Staley‚Äôs livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.' Staley called the accusation a 'Trumpian lie,' noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.)\\" References External links *AIDSmeds.com *How to Survive a Plague Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Activists from Pennsylvania Category:American financial businesspeople Category:American health activists Category:Gay men Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:JPMorgan Chase employees Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:LGBT people from Pennsylvania Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States ","title":"Peter Staley"},{"id":"40232900","text":"The Allard Palm Beach is a small British roadster built by Allard Motor Company between 1952 and 1958, with a Mark II introduced in 1956.

Joep LeerssenLeerssen studied Comparative literature in Aachen (M.A. 1979) and Anglo-Irish Studies at University College Dublin (M.A. 1980), and received his doctorate from Utrecht University in 1986. He was appointed lecturer in European Studies in Amsterdam in 1986 and was given a professorial chair in the same subject in 1991. In addition, he has held guest professorships and visiting fellowships in Harvard (Erasmus Chair), Cambridge (Magdalene College) and G√∂ttingen. He headed the Huizinga Institute,http://huizingainstituut.nl Huizinga Institute the Dutch National Research Institute for Cultural History, from 1996 until 2005. Leerssen has worked in the fields of Irish Studies, imagology and European studies. His main research focus is on the relationship between national (self-)stereotyping and nationalism, and on the historical development of cultural and romantic nationalism in nineteenth-century Europe, using literary texts as a source for the history of ideas. His books Mere Irish & F√≠or-Ghael (1986, repr. 1996) and Remembrance and Imagination (1996) deal with the pre-1800 and 19th-century emergence of an Irish national identity; Imagology (co-edited with Manfred Beller, 2007) is a handbook on the literary articulation of stereotypes of national characters; National Thought in Europe a survey of the culture-historical growth of nationalism in Europe.Notice and jury report on the awarding of the Academy Professorship In the field of nationalism studies, Leerssen takes up an intermediary position between the approaches of ethnosymbolism and modernism, stressing \\"the long memory and the short history\\" of nationalism. While emphasizing the agency of culture in the rise and spread of nationalism, he considers this culture to consist of a set of literary myths and stereotypes which only in modern times, under the influence of Romantic historicism, came to be mistaken for long- standing ethnic continuities.B. Brincker et al., \\"Seventh nations and nationalism debate: Joep Leerssen's National thought in Europe: A cultural history\\", Nations and Nationalism, 19.3 (2013), 409-433 Additionally, national identities always take shape by opposing the nation to a (historically changeable) variety of stereotyped foreigners; Leerssen defines nationalism as the \\"political instrumentalization\\" of such self/other-stereotypes. Since nationalism always involves an oppositional dynamics between different societies, and can therefore never be adequately comprehended on a single- country basis, Leerssen pleads for a rigorously transnational, comparative approach.Website of the \\"Study Platform on Interlocking Nationalisms\\" (SPIN) Within The Netherlands, Leerssen was involved in the official recognition of Limburgish as a regional language; he has written literary work in Limburgish. In 2008 Leerssen was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Bucharest (2014).

The historic parish covered 1,023 acres. Neighbouring settlements Saint Llwchaiarn The Church is dedicated to the 6th-century Saint Llwchaiarn or Lluwchaiarn, who was also the patron saint of the adjacent Llanllwchaearn and of two parishes in Ceredigion. The placename presents a problem as it would be expected that the llan (\\"parish\\") would proceed the recognizable name of its patron saint, but this is not the case.

The first alterations were undertaken from 1839 to 1843 by the rector, John Parker (1798-1860), an enthusiastic advocate of the Gothic style. The present curiously slender tower and a semi-dormer window on the S side were added at this time, and the porch was richly ornamented. The second series of restorations took place in 1892 and were more conventional in style; plans were prepared by Sir Aston Webb and the work was funded by Charles Whitley Owen of Fronfraith Hall. The E and N walls were rebuilt, and a new E window was built to match the old Medieval window which was removed to the E boundary wall of the churchyard, where it remains..

Administrative history In the Medieval period Llanmerewig was in the Commote of Cedewain in the Kingdom of Powys. Llanmerewig appears to have consisted of only one or two townships, Llanmerewig itself and Cilgwrgan; which in the Medieval period may have been a township. In 1885, the township of Bolbro, which was previously in Llandyssil parish, was transferred to Llanmerewig. For ecclesiastical administration the parish is in the Diocese of St Asaph, the Archdeaconry of Montgomery and the Deanery of Cedewain. In 1974, as a result of Local Government reform, Llanmerewig was joined with Llandyssil Parish Council to become a Community Council within the new Montgomeryshire District Council. In 1984 the Community Council was renamed Abermule with Llandyssil Community Council. At this time, the Community Council covered the old parishes of Llanmerewig and Llandyssil, together with Dolforwyn, which had been a township in Bettws Cedewain parish.English E (ed) 1999 \\"A Collected History of the Communities of Llandyssil, Abermule and Llanmerewig\\" In 1996, with the abolition of the Montgomeryshire District Council, the Community Council became part of the Powys County Council unitary authority.

Comics =Mirage= In the Mirage Studios' TMNT comic Dome Doom, he is currently retired from super-hero business and lives in Northampton, Massachusetts. In volume 4 issue #6 Shadow's boyfriend, Jay, decides to investigate the farmhouse where she lives in order to get a look at her mysterious grandfather. The boy takes a rifle with him to utilize its scope to get a closer look, and he's discovered by a very unhappy Metal Head. =IDW= In the IDW comic, Metalhead is constructed by Harold Lillja as a robot able to fight controlled remotely. It is later used to store Donatello's consciousness after he is critically injured during a fight with Bebop and Rocksteady, and destroyed when Donatello transferred back to his own body. Donatello later rebuilt Metalhead, and was shocked to discover a copy of his own consciousness existing in the robot body. This consciousness, briefly called \\"Metal-Don,\\" became mentally unstable because of the pain of his PTSD and his inability to process his emotions. After attacking Donatello, Metalhead transferred himself into a new robot body, erased his emotions, and escaped the Turtles. He later decided to eliminate the Turtles in exchange for access to Area 51's computers, needing an outlet for his incredible mental abilities. Cartoons =1987 cartoon= In the 1987 series, Metalhead first appeared in the season 3 episode \\"The Making of Metalhead\\" where it was imbued with the thoughts and memories of the Ninja Turtles. This gave Metalhead an identity disorder until Donatello reprograms him to work for the Ninja Turtles. In this appearance, Metalhead replicated the voices of the Ninja Turtles, Shredder, and April O'Neil, meaning that Metalhead was voiced by Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, Dorian Harewood (who was filling in for James Avery at the time,) and Renae Jacobs. He was only seen again when Donatello tries to get him to vacuum their TV room in the season 4 episode \\"Big Bug Blunder.\\" =2003 cartoon= In the 2003 series, he was a member of the original Justice Force and remains a member of the current Justice Force, making him the only member to serve in both incarnations of the team. Neither incarnation seems to have aged in the intervening decades; in the case of the first incarnation, it was stated that this was due to his artificial nature. Metal Head was also part of the final attack on the Tengu Shredder. Metal Head appears in the \\"Fast Forward\\" season episode The Journal. Metal Head also appears in TMNT: Back to the Sewer. He shows up in the episodes \\"Super Power Struggle\\" and \\"Wedding Bells and Bytes.\\" =2012 cartoon= In the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, Metalhead was created by Donatello from a salvaged Kraang droid, creating Metalhead to be their robotic brother. Donatello could control Metalhead via a NES-like controller while observing the situation through a TV monitor since there are cameras in Metalhead's eyes. Also, Donatello can speak through Metalhead. While Metalhead proved to be nearly unstoppable in combat situations, he was far too clunky and heavy to properly sneak around. Thus, this left Metalhead to be forced to sit out a mission against the Kraang. When his brothers became overwhelmed, Donatello sent Metalhead in. He easily defeated the Kraang attacking them, knocking off the control antenna in the process. One Kraang realized that Metalhead was made from their technology and detached from its robot body where it opted to control Metalhead. With the signal lost without the control antenna, Donatello could not defend Metalhead from the Kraang's control. The Kraang-controlled Metalhead attacked the Ninja Turtles, nearly killing them until Donatello showed up in person. Donatello managed to defeat Metalhead by crashing a support pillar on it. The Kraang controlling it ran off. In \\"Showdown\\" Pt. 1, Metalhead was rebuilt by Donatello where it aided the Ninja Turtles in the battle against the Kraang. Apparently now programmed with some degree of independence and operating without any sign of a direct controller, Metalhead drove the Shellraiser into the TCRI building lobby and subsequently attacked the Kraang guards while the Ninja Turtles used their new gliders to infiltrate the building from the roof. Metalhead is reconfigured by Donatello in \\"Metalhead Rewired\\", in which he exhibits a personality similar to R2-D2 - being a sentient, small and extremely helpful droid in the service of the heroes. After a battle with the Kraang goes awry, Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael vote to terminate Metalhead, who quickly escapes before Donatello can do so. Metalhead is able to find a portal to a Kraang prison where many mutants from the series have been incarcerated. Realizing Metalhead's benevolence, the Turtles fight alongside him to both free the imprisoned mutants and to return to New York. However, Metalhead is forced to remain behind to keep an escape portal open, and he self-destructs in order to destroy the portal device and the Kraang swarming him. The Turtles and the various mutants are able to escape, and Donatello finds Metalhead's lifeless head. Grieving, Donatello ponders over one day being able to rebuild Metalhead. A second version of Metalhead is inhabited by Donatello's consciousness in the alternate-universe three-part special \\"Raphael: Mutant Apocalypse.\\" Video games Metalhead appears in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time as the boss of the second level Alleycat Blues. He has extending punch and kick attacks, as well as a machine gun in his chest. This version was slightly redesigned for the remake, Turtles in Time Re- Shelled; this version of Metalhead was voiced by Wayne Grayson. The instruction manual of the Super NES version of Turtles in Time erroneously refers to Metalhead as Mechaturtle. Toys Metalhead appeared as part of both the 1989 and 2012 toy line.

However, upon Townshend's decision to make a solo album, the song was resurrected. Pete Townshend has since said that the song was created in an attempt to replicate Kinks' songwriter Ray Davies' style of writing. In 1982, Townshend said, \\"Ray's always been a big influence on me. I've never been able to write in the same way, though I've often tried. In fact, I'm terrible at it.

It was a major influence on many varieties of devotional literature in late-medieval Europe, both in Latin and in the vernaculars. This practice of prayer, reading, and meditation was often cultivated through visualization and concentration on vivid images of scenes from the Bible, Saints' Lives, Virgin Mary, Christ and religious symbols, feeling from the result. These images could be either conjured up in people's minds when they read or heard poetry and other pieces of religious literature, or they could gaze on manuscript illuminations and other pieces of art as they prayed and meditated on the scenes depicted. In either case, this style of affective meditation asked the \\"viewer\\" to engage with the scene as if she or he were physically present and to stir up feelings of love, fear, grief, and/or repentance for sin.

While the texts and art of affective piety could focus on a variety of subjects, they are particularly noted for their gory and violent depictions of the Passion and Crucifixion, as in Richard Rolle's Meditation on the Passion: :Ah, Lord, your sorrow--why was it not my death? Now they lead you forth as naked as a worm, with torturers around you and armed knights. The press of the crowd was incredibly intense as they threw things and harried you so shamefully, kicking at you as if you had been a dog. I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood. Your lovely face is so pale and swollen with the blows and the beatings, and covered with spittle and phlegm. And down runs your blood; it horrifies me to see it.

In the autobiographical book she dictated to two different scribes, Margery describes her imaginative and emotional reaction during Palm Sunday services: :Sche had many an holy thowt of owr Lordys passyon and beheld hym in hir gostly :syght as verily as he had ben aforn hir in hir bodily syght. Therfor myth sche not :wythstondyn wepyng and sobbyng, but sche must nedys wepyn, cryin, and sobbyn :whan sche beheld hir Savyowr suffyr so gret peynys for hir lofe. The Isenheim Altarpiece provides a good, late instance of a piece of art meant to engage the emotions. Images for more intimate, private use can be found in Books of Hours and other manuscripts. Summary Affective piety can be described as a type of highly emotional devotion, focused on the humanity of Jesus, which developed during the High Middle Ages. Anselm of Canterbury, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Francis of Assisi each played a key role in the development of this approach to spirituality. Traces of an affective sensitivity can be found in Late Antiquity, when clergymen preached sermons with vivid descriptions of the Passion. One example of this is an Eastertide sermon by St. Augustine: :The Passion of the Lord signifies our time, in which we now weep. Whips, fetters, mockings, spit, crown of thorns, embittered wine, vinegar in a sponge, insults, taunts, finally the cross itself, the holy limbs hanging on the wood, what does this signify to us, if not the time in which we act, the time of mourning, the time of mortality, the time of temptation? The origins and functions of affective piety: the current scholarly consensus =The \\"Southern Thesis\\"= In the chapter on high medieval spirituality in his book The Making of the Middle Ages, the medievalist Richard W. SouthernGuardian Obit was building on the work of scholars such as Andr√© Wilmart and √âtienne Gilson. Nevertheless, he is generally credited with having drawn attention to what he (and others) understood to be a shift in devotional practice at the start of the High Middle Ages. He described a \\"mood of emotional tenderness which runs through the literature of the twelfth century\\" and considered Anselm of Canterbury to be the quintessential example of an eleventh-century \\"urge towards a greater measure of solitude, of introspection, and self- knowledge,\\" an urge that \\"ran like fire through Europe in the generation after his death and produced an outburst of meditations and spiritual soliloquies.\\" Southern, who would go on to write two different biographies of Anselm, argued that \\"Anselm was the founder of the new type of ardent and effusive self- disclosure,\\" but that \\"it was the Cistercians who produced the greatest volume, and, as it were, set the fashion in this type of literature.\\" On Southern's view, both Anselm and the Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux gave form in their writings to a \\"theme of tenderness and compassion for the sufferings and helplessness of the Saviour of the world.\\" Anselm, he wrote, \\"dwelt with passionate intensity on the details of Christ's sufferings,\\" and his prayers \\"opened up a new world of ardent emotion and piety.\\" Southern attributed this \\"new feeling about the humanity of the Saviour\\" to a shift in soteriology, the doctrine concerning how humanity comes to be \\"saved from the consequences of sin.\\" Southern claimed that the \\"Devil's Rights,\\" or Ransom Theory, left little room for human action, for according to it salvation was brought about in a \\"cosmic struggle\\" in which Satan had to be brought \\"to break the rules under which he held mankind in fee.\\" Anselm (according to Southern) rejected this theory for one theologians call the Satisfaction Theory of Atonement, in which \\"Christ suffered as a substitute on behalf of humankind satisfying the demands of God's honor by his infinite merit.\\" This allowed for a \\"fresh appreciation of the human sufferings of the Redeemer.\\" Anselm's Orationes sive meditationes (Prayers and Meditations) signalled something that Southern (in his 1990 biography of Anselm) called \\"The Anselmian Transformation\\": a shift from the brief, simple, corporate prayers of the Carolingian period to more introspective, private \\"prolonged ourpourings\\" spoken in \\"a language of self-revelation\\" infused with \\"theological insight.\\" Anselm, Southern wrote, \\"added the discipline of exact thought and the warmth of exuberant feeling to the religious impulses of his day.\\" Anselm's prayers work on the emotions; he \\"strains every resource of language to express and stimulate in his reader both the mental excitation and humiliation necessary for the double activity of self-examination and abasement in the presence of holiness.\\" In a later generation, Southern argued, Bernard of Clairvaux refined and built on this, and the \\"imaginative following of the details of the earthly life of Jesus, and especially of the sufferings of the Cross, became part of that programme of progress from carnal to spiritual love which we have called the Cistercian programme.\\" Then, with \\"St. Francis and his followers, the fruits of the experiences of St. Anselm and St. Bernard were brought to the market place, and became the common property of the lay and clerical world alike.\\" Concerning later affective piety, Southern writes that \\"the somewhat hectic piety of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\\" resulted from a weakening of the intellectual structure that gave rise to the \\"surge of pious devotion\\" of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Other scholars repeated this story over the next thirty years, either drawing on Southern's work or from the same sources. Notable among them are Louis L. Martz [The Poetry of Meditation: A Study in English Religious Literature of the Seventeenth Century (1954)], William A. Pantin [The English Church in the Fourteenth Century (1955)], Rosemary Woolf [The English Religious Lyric in the Middle Ages (1968)], Douglas Gray [Themes and Images in the Medieval English Lyric (1972)], and Elizabeth Salter [Nicholas Love's \\"Myrrour of the blessed lyf of Jesu Christ\\" (1974)]. The Southern Thesis also informs Richard Kieckhefer's book, Unquiet Souls (1984), even taking on explanatory force in his chapter on \\"Devotion to the Passion.\\" The Southern Thesis remains the basis of the standard definition of affective piety, as, for example, in this definition from an anthology of devotional literature: :The twelfth century is marked by the growth of affective piety, or a form of spirituality that differed from that of the previous centuries by placing much greater emphasis on self-examination, the inner emotions, and the cultivation of an interior life. This form of piety was typically anchored in devotion to Christ in his human form, with special attention to the events of the Passion. The movement was led first by the Cistercians Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) and Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1167); by the thirteenth century the movement came to be closely identified with Franciscan religiosity, especially as shaped by Francis of Assisi (d. 1226) and Bonaventure (d. 1274). The flamboyant piety of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries developed from these roots. Although it would be a mistake to view late medieval piety as homogeneous, its dominant expressions were notable for heightened degrees of emotionalism and a preoccupation with the tortured body of Christ and the grief of the Virgin Mary. The same general outline is followed by Thomas H. Bestul in Texts of the Passion: Latin Devotional Literature and Medieval Society (1996), in his entry on \\"Devotional and Mystical Literature\\" in Medieval Latin: An Introduction and Bibliographical Guide (1999), and in his chapter \\"Meditatio/Meditation\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Mysticism (2012). A classic textual model for affective meditation is found in the De institutione inclusarum, or The Rule for Recluses, a text written by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister, who was living as an anchoress (a female religious recluse). In the section of the text devoted to the Nativity of Jesus, Aelred wrote: :...follow her [the Virgin Mary] as she goes to Bethlehem, and turning away from the inn with her, help and humor her during the birth; and when the little child is placed in the manger, burst out words of exultation, crying out with Isaiah: A child is born to us, a son is given to us (Is. 9.6). :Embrace that sweet manger, let love conquer bashfulness, and emotion drive out fear so that you fix your lips on those most sacred feet and repeat the kisses. =The Franciscan popularization thesis= One common variation on the Southern Thesis describes affective piety from the thirteenth century on as essentially Franciscan. One early and still widely cited source for this opinion is F.J.E. Raby's A History of Christian-Latin Poetry. While David L. Jeffrey's book The Early English Lyric & Franciscan Spirituality (1975) did not study affective piety per se, the book followed on previous histories of spirituality (such as the Leclercq, Vandenbrouke, and Bouyer volume, The Spirituality of the Middle Ages) that describe \\"tender and affective meditation on Christ and especially on those mysteries of his life that are most apt to touch the heart--his birth, childhood, passion, and death,\\" as being particularly \\"characteristic\\" of Franciscan piety. [Note that there were mixed reviews of Jeffrey's book.] Clarissa Atkinson's study Mystic and Pilgrim: the Book and World of Margery Kempe (1983), follows the \\"Southern Thesis\\" in the fifth chapter, \\"'In the Likeness of a Man': The Tradition of Affective Piety.\\" But she adds, \\"Of all the forces that helped to shape popular devotion in the Middle Ages, none was more significant than the Franciscans.\\"\\" She elaborates on how Bernard of Clairvaux's devotion to and \\"adoration of the sacred humanity...was adapted by the Franciscans, who transformed it into a popular passion focused on the details of Christ's birth and death and used it to preach penitence to large numbers of lay as well as religious people.\\" St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata, Book of Hours ( Belgium, ca. 1525‚Äì30). The Morgan Library & Museum. In an article on \\"The Humanity and Passion of Christ\\" (1987), Ewert Cousins (drawing on Wilmart) lays out the trajectory from the Patristics, to monasticism, to Peter Damian, John of F√©camp and Anselm, to the Cistercians. But he also privileges St. Francis of Assisi, who he says \\"\\"[m]ore than any other saint or spiritual writer...transformed religious sensibility in the direction of devotion to the humanity of Christ.\\" Much of the article focuses on affective meditations on the life of Christ as characteristically Franciscan. Another contribution to the same volume, Richard Kieckhefer's \\"Major Currents in Late Medieval Devotion,\\" also alludes to Franciscan popularization of meditation on the humanity of Christ. Kieckhefer's earlier book Unquiet Souls: Fourteenth-Century Saints and Their Religious Milieu (1984) had dwelt in more detail on the influence of the Franciscans. Around the same time, Denise Despres published Ghostly Sights: Visual Meditation in Late-Medieval Literature (1989), a study influenced by Jeffrey's focus on the Franciscan contribution as well as John Fleming's support of Jeffrey's thesis in An Introduction to the Franciscan Literature of the Middle Ages (1977). In Despres' book, affective devotion is simply defined as \\"Franciscan meditation.\\" Sarah McNamer has pointed out that \\"The characterization of affective meditation as \\"Franciscan\\" is pervasive, even in studies published as recently as 2008.\\" The recent studies she refers to include Eamon Duffy's The Stripping of the Altars, which, in a section on Passion devotions, reproduces the Southern Thesis with emphasis on the Franciscans and Sarah Beckwith's Christ's Body: Identity, Culture and Society in Late Medieval Writings. Beckwith, McNamer writes, \\"describes the 'emphatic fetishizing of Christ's torn and bleeding body' as 'Franciscanism' or 'Franciscan affectus'.\\" McNamer also notes that in Powers of the Holy, David Aers \\"cites Richard Kieckhefer's characterization of the Bernardine-Franciscan transformation in late medieval piety approvingly.\\" She quotes Aers, who writes that this transformation \\"has been exceptionally well-documented by numerous scholars in diverse disciplines of research.\\" All this shows how \\"deeply entrenched the notion is that affective meditation is \\"Franciscan.\\" =Feminism, gender, and the body: the Bynum Thesis= Beginning in the 1960s, scholars of medieval Christianity shifted from their previous focus on mystical experience to take up the study of popular religion and lay spirituality. Yet Caroline Walker Bynum could write in 1982 that \\"the spirituality of women...has been surprisingly neglected when we consider that the most important book on twelfth and thirteenth-century religion in the past fifty years has been Grundmann's study of the beguines.\\" Herbert Grundmann's 1935 book, Religi√∂se Bewegungen im Mittelalter (Religious Movements in the Middle Ages), had been republished in 1961 and 1975, and it did end up having a great influence on the study of medieval women. The themes of this important historical study included \\"the twelfth-century quest for the 'apostolic life,' with particular sensitivity to the issue of poverty; the common inspiration of groups ending up both inside and outside the church (with comparisons of Francis and Waldo); the centrality of women in those movements; Innocent III's skillful and crucial handling of the mendicants; and the rise of a vernacular religious culture for the laity, especially lay women.\\" Bynum's own work was key in bringing Grundmann's work on religious women and women's movements to the attention of American feminist scholars. Starting in the late 1970s a generation of feminist medievalists from a variety of disciplines began the work of bringing women authors and women's religious experience into the mainstream of scholarship on medieval spirituality, and affective piety was soon taken to be a special attribute of medieval women's religious experience. Hours of Mary of Burgundy, Flanders, ca. 1477 (Vienna, Austrian National Library, cod. 1857, f. 14v) For example, Clarissa Atkinson's book, Mystic and Pilgrim: The Book and World of Margery Kempe (1983), built on the work of Elizabeth Salter, Susan Dickman, Richard W. Southern, Giles Constable, and Caroline Walker Bynum for her description of the \\"affective piety\\" that shaped Margery Kempe's religious emotions and performances. Atkinson's book had great influence on the study of Margery Kempe, linking Kempe firmly to Affective Piety. As noted above, in \\"Chapter Five: 'In the Likeness of a Man,' The Tradition of Affective Piety,'\\" she wrote a version of the Southern Thesis, adding sections on Franciscan popularization and on Richard Rolle as an author and proponent of fourteenth-century affective devotions. She also drew attention to the genre of Meditations on the Life of Christ, especially the version composed by Nicholas Love and circulated from 1410 on. Other significant touches are Atkinson's assertion that it was requests from pious women that prompted \\"churchmen\\" to \\"[produce] much of the devotional literature of Christianity,\\" and the chapter's definition of the goal of affective piety: \\"intense feeling\\" that \\"included the 'compassion' that enabled Christians to participate in Christ's life and death, the 'contrition' that produced repentance and conversion, and the emotive, sensory accompaniments of an experience of the divine.\\" But it is Caroline Walker Bynum's 1982 collection of essays, Jesus as Mother (cited by Atkinson) and her 1987 book Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women that have had the greatest impact when it comes to questions of women, the body, and affective devotion. As Amy Hollywood has written, \\"no other scholar has done so much to shape feminist work on Christian spirituality.\\" In the introduction to Jesus as Mother, Bynum includes the standard narrative, but builds on it: : ...eleventh- and twelfth-century writers begin to stress Christ's humanity, both in affective and sentimentalized responses to the gospel story (e.g., the devotion of Marie of Oignes to the Christmas cr√™che) and in a new compulsion to build into the Christian life a literal imitation of the details of Jesus' ministry. The fundamental religious battle is now located within the self, and it is less a battle than a journey--a journey toward God. Hagiography, whose subjects more and more frequently are women and laity, focuses increasingly on inner virtues and experiences (often accompanied by external phenomena such as trances, levitation, and stigmata) rather than grand actions on the stage of history. Alongside the increase in efforts to stimulate affective responses, twelfth- century religious writing (most of which was produced by men) shows an outburst of mystical theology after hundreds of years of silence about it and a great increase in devotion to female figures, in use of feminine metaphors, and in admiration for characteristics (e.g., tears, weakness, and mercy or \\"ethical irrationality\\") that people of the period stereotyped as feminine. The footnote to the last sentence quoted refers readers to the sub-sections of her chapter \\"Jesus and Mother and Abbot as Mother\\" entitled \\"The Theme of 'Mother Jesus' as a Reflection of Affective Spirituality\\" and The Feminization of Religious Language and Its Social Context.\\" Christ as the Man of Sorrows, with Arma Christi. Netherlands, ca. 1486 Jesus as Mother drew important attention to how gender and social contexts shaped religious experience and religious language, especially in regard to feminine metaphors and images for Christ, while Bynum's Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women (1987) turned specific attention to women's religious experiences. Both books, however, pursue the thesis that \\"women's spirituality in the Late Middle Ages differed in significant ways from men's\\"Hollywood. \\"Feminist Studies\\". pp. 366‚Äì368 This book swiftly became \\"emblematic both within and beyond medieval studies.\\" The so-called \\"Bynum Thesis\\" that originated from these studies is summed up in another of her oft-cited works, the chapter of Fragmentation and Redemption entitled \\"The Female Body and Religious Practice in the later Middle Ages\\" :Thus, as many recent scholars have argued, the spiritualities of male and female mystics were different, and this difference has something to do with the body. Women were more apt to somatize religious experience and to write in intense bodily metaphors; women mystics were more likely than men to receive graphically physical visions of God; both men and women were inclined to attribute to women and encourage in them intense asceticisms and ecstasies. Moreover, the most bizarre bodily occurrences associated with women (e.g., stigmata, incorruptibility of the cadaver in death, mystical lactations and pregnancies, catatonic trances, ecstatic nosebleeds, miraculous anorexia, eating and drinking pus, visions of bleeding hosts) either first appear in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries or increase significantly in frequency at that time. (194) Saint Catherine of Siena receiving the stigmata. Book of Hours (ca. 1440 ca.), Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale, MS lat. 10533 The work of Bynum and the scholars who followed her (while this may not have been their intention) has resulted in a strand of thought in which the \\"bodily\\" meditations involved in Affective Piety are regarded as a feminized, if not female, practice. For one example, Sarah Beckwith's Christ's Body: Identity, Culture and Society in Late Medieval Writing (1993) amplifies on the Southern Thesis and stresses the Franciscan contribution. The book ends with a chapter on Margery Kempe which includes descriptions of Margery's \\"shared fleshliness\\" and \\"bodily identification\\" with Christ, of her graphic imaginings \\"rooted in the visceral compassion with the passion of Christ,\\" of \\"her willing assumption of suffering,\\" of her book's evocation of the image of Christ as mother (among other images), and of how her religiosity has a tendency to bypass the clergy. More recently, June L. Mecham has written: \\"Bynum illustrated the sophisticated ways in which female religious could turn the culturally negative associations of women with physicality into a positive position that enabled women to identify with the humanity of Christ. Subsequent research has continued to build upon Bynum‚Äôs characterization, even as it questions the dichotomy of a somatic and ecstatic female spirituality versus an educated and intellectualized male religiosity.\\" Sarah McNamer's book, Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion (2010), builds on the Bynum Thesis. McNamer writes that \\"though it has had its critics, Bynum's model retains tremendous explanatory force.\\" She argues: # that (in amplification of the Bynum Thesis) in certain medieval English texts written for women, \\"Bride of Christ\\" imagery functioned differently that it did in texts for men: \\"if the standard rituals were enacted, chastity observed, and, crucially, the fitting feelings repeatedly performed, female religious could become literally, by which I mean legally, married to Christ-- not only in this life, but for all eternity\\" (28). # that (in a revision to the Southern Thesis that explicitly disagrees with Fulton's [See below,\\"Revising the Myth of Anselmian Origins]) the \\"chief 'catalyst' of the change in emotional attitudes towards Christ and his passion\\" was female devotional practice. \\"Women,\\" McNamer writes, \\"were instrumental to this shift in sensibility at the very beginning.\\" She argues (controversially) that John of F√©camp's Libellus precum (copies of which are known to have been sent to Agnes of Poitiers and to a nun) does not derive its \\"novel affectivity\\"from \\"John's private colloquys with God.\\" Rather it was \\"a script for the performance of prayer, designed especially for the use of the women to whom it is addressed in the two surviving prefaces\\" (72). She concludes that meditations such as these and Anselm's (an early version of which was sent to a certain Adelaide, a royal nun, and a later, complete version to Matilda of Tuscany) \\"could justly be described as 'surfacings' of affective practices among women\\" that are consonant with the idea that women's compassionate love for Christ afforded them legal marriage to him here and in the next life (84). # that (in a revision of the Franciscan Thesis) the genre of meditations on the life of Christ, and, especially, the pseudo-Bonaventurian Meditationes vitae Christi, are evidence for \\"a tradition of affective meditation among women.' She argues that \\"the original version of the Meditations was a short Italian text composed by one nun for another\\" that was then expanded, translated into Latin, and corrected by a male, Franciscan redactor (95‚Äì96). Her detailed research on this was published as an article in 2009. This thesis has not been accepted by all readers. A research group in the Program of Italian Literature and Culture at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Budapest, while not disagreeing with McNamer, speculates on what detailed collation of the Latin Text and all the extant Italian texts might show, especially since such a collation was not part of her project. Michelle Karnes, however, includes in a footnote the observation, \\"McNamer has suggested that the Meditationes vitae Christi was written by a woman, but she provides only one piece of evidence that is far from conclusive to support the claim (Affective Meditation, 110‚Äì 15). It is more likely that the author was male.\\" # that \\"as scripted in and through Middle English meditations on the Passion [compassion] is largely a function of gender: to perform compassion is to feel like a woman\\" (119). Karnes, meanwhile, has stated openly that she is \\"[u]nconvinced that compassion belongs essentially to women,\\" writing that she \\"hold[s] that affective meditation in at its foundation neither female- nor lay-oriented.\\" The origins and functions of affective piety: revising the consensus Two parts of the standard scholarly paradigm for affective piety have been subject to the most critique: The \\"Bynum Thesis\\" and The Myth of Anselmian Origins. = Revising the \\"Bynum Thesis\\" = The \\"Bynum Thesis\\" has been subject to pressure, often controversially, on a number of points, essentialism, the idea of a difference between male and female spirituality, the idea that the type of practices described \\"empowered\\" women, the use of gender as the sole category of difference, and the very idea of \\"movements\\" themselves. Bynum's own reservations concerning the construction of \\"affective piety\\" Given how other scholars have used her work to generalize about affective piety, it should be stressed that Caroline Walker Bynum voiced a clear warning in Jesus as Mother, writing: :We must be careful not to overemphasize the affective aspects of later medieval piety. Even in writers, like Marguerite of Oingt, who give the images very concrete development, the notion of Christ as mother, like that of Christ the bridegroom, remains allegorical. Moreover, the humanity of Christ is not as absent in early medieval devotion as many twelfth-century scholars have suggested, following Southern. Piety from the later Middle Ages is not as literal in its use of images or a filled with weeping and ecstasy as scholars since Huizinga have thought. Moreover, in Wonderful Blood: Theology and Practice in Late Medieval Northern Germany and Beyond, Bynum points out that \\"interpretations of late medieval spirituality need to disaggregate phenomena often telescoped under terms such as ‚Äòaffective,‚Äô ‚Äòdevotional,‚Äô ‚Äòexpressionist,‚Äô or ‚Äòviolent.‚Äô\\" Essentialism Kathleen Biddick's article, \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders: Technologies of the Visible\\" (1993), brought to the fore concerns over how Holy Feast and Holy Fast essentialized \\"women\\" and \\"experience,\\" reducing women to an \\"essential, ahistorical maternal.\\"Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". p. 397. Biddick also wrote that in Bynum's book, \\"gender carries the more restricted sense of 'woman.'\\"Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". p. 401. Bynum discusses this controversy in an autobiographical essay of 2012, where she writes, :The study Holy Feast and Holy Fast, my most influential book, arose almost seamlessly from \\"Jesus as Mother.\\" Having explored the pressures and opportunities that led certain groups of religious men to use explicitly gendered images for themselves and for the divine, I was curious about whether religious women did so. And I discovered, again to put it a bit simply, that what seemed distinctive about woman-authored texts and male accounts of women was not awareness of gender or complex and self-conscious use of gendered language, but food images and food practices. Although misunderstood by some critics as \\"essentializing\\" (this was a nasty charge in the 1990s) or as a glorification of female masochism, it was in fact neither. The argument that women‚Äôs texts were characterized by specific metaphors and their lives by specific behaviors was not the imposition of modern assumptions about \\"woman.\\" It was empirical, based on a careful comparison of female-authored texts about the divine, female-authored texts about women, and male-authored texts about women, with texts about men by religious men, such as St. Francis of Assisi or Heinrich Suso, who appeared to be closest in their spirituality to that of women. David Aers, while deeply respectful of Bynum's work, writes of \\"Bynum's rather uncritical deployment of the term 'women'\\" and wonders \\"whether 'feminizing' the tortured body of Christ as material, for instance, may not actually reinforce some basic premises and fantasies in traditional patriarchal constitutions of 'women.'\\" In his article \\"Desire for the Past\\" (1999), Nicholas Watson discusses the controversy that erupted after the publication of Biddick's article (64 & 67), and subjects Biddick's piece itself to analysis (68‚Äì72). He also comments on and critiques Aers' reading of Bynum's work (66‚Äì68). In the end, however, Watson agrees that Holy Feast and Holy Fast should be \\"read with caution\\" (84). On his view it has \\"a tendency...to homogenize the devotional practices it considers, presenting a single mode of female spirituality\\" as well as finding \\"its closest point of identification in the past not with the feelings of holy women, but in those of the men who described them,\\" thus resulting in \\"unintended identification with a medieval masculine viewpoint\\" (77). Differentiation between men's and women's spirituality Amy Hollywood has shown that \\"when men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs religious writings are looked at together, we see that men and women engage in often intense relationships of mutual influence, debate, and appropriation. As a result, any clearly marked distinction between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs spirituality almost immediately breaks down (although the tendency for men to want women‚Äôs spirituality to take certain forms remains constant at least throughout the Middle Ages and no doubt well into the modern period).\\" Studies of Meister Eckhart by her and by Bernard McGinn \\"show a beguine influence\\" on him \\"which breaks down both older claims about women‚Äôs affective spirituality versus men‚Äôs speculative mysticism as well as Bynum‚Äôs slightly different thesis.\\" Hollywood also points to Watson's study of Richard Rolle, which \\"makes similar arguments.\\" For example, Watson writes that Rolle's \\"images used to describe the four experiences [of the perfectly converted] are derived from all four senses: sight (Sight into Heaven), touch (fervor), smell or taste (dulcor), sound (canor). He also describes the highly emotional, \\"spiritually sexual,\\" and sensual language of Rolle's early poem Canticum Amoris. Vincent Gillespie's work also undermines the idea that there was a clear distinction between men and women when it came to religious practice, for, he writes, in the fifteenth century, \\"texts written for the particular circumstances of female religious (which had achieved, somewhat earlier, extension of their audience into ranks of the pious noble and gentlewomen) were being addressed to or compiled for laymen.\\" Nicole R. Rice's book Lay Piety and Religious Discipline in Middle English Literature shows even more amply how books for spiritual guidance and rules for the spiritual life written for female religious could, sometimes with little revision, be popular with the laity, both male and female. On this, see also Jennifer Bryan's Looking Inward: Devotional Reading and the Private Self in Late Medieval England, especially the section on \\"Women's Reading, Lay Reading.\\" The empowerment thesis David Aers, in particular, has challenged the idea that women were \\"empowered\\" by imitation of Christ through self-inflicted suffering or by a \\"natural\\" association of women's bodies with food (due to lactation) or with a feminized Christ, whose body nurtured, even nursed, the hungry of spirit and who was imagined as birthing salvation on the cross. He characterizes the \\"empowerment thesis\\" as follows: \\"as the argument goes, as Christ's suffering humanity saved the world so suffering women, subjected by their culture in numerous ways, become the most powerful representatives of the powerless, bleeding, suffering, but salvific Christ\\" (30). Aers questions whether women's ascetic imitation of the \\"dominant figuration of Christ's humanity\\" really \\"empowered the subordinate\\" or \\"subverted the logic and religion of a patriarchal and profoundly mysoginistic [sic] culture\\" (34). Alcuin Blamires provides a summary of the empowerment theory and its critique in his book chapter \\"Beneath the Pulpit\\": :What women might have gained from cultivating devotions such as these has recently become a contentious matter. According to one school of thought, here lay an empowerment of women, both because the period‚Äôs cultural description of their bodies was preoccupied with blood and lactation and with nourishing in ways that implied a convergence between women and the salvific life-giving body of Christ (pouring out Eucharistic blood on the cross), and secondly because women were so constituted by their culture as subjected, powerless, suffering beings that they could ‚Äòrepresent‚Äô with particular force the suffering humanity of Christ. :According to a contrary school of thought, there lay not empowerment but disempowerment in the late-medieval promotion of affective piety. In this view the women and men who practised it were in effect taking a kind of drug (affective ecstasy, so to speak) which kept them fixated on a particular sentimental construction of the ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô of Christ, and diverted attention from aspects of his ministry which could pose serious problems for the medieval Church. The argument is that alternative, more challenging, and hence institutionally marginalized delineation of what was important in Christ‚Äôs ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô and ministry remained visible in heterodox contexts, or lurked in otherwise orthodox writing such as Langland‚Äôs. :In this latter view affective piety was less a ‚Äònatural‚Äô phenomenon than an instrument of control, one that subtly absorbed the religious energies of women in particular. For another description of the Aers anti-empowerment thesis see Watson, \\"Desire for the Past.\\" Watson warns, however, that he is uneasy about how Aers' theory may contrive a \\"collapse of Bynum's model of female resistance into generalized model of compliance to make space for a picture of Lollard heroism that seems as idealizing as what it replaces\\" (68). In the same year that Aers published his arguments, Thomas H. Bestul also sounded a note of caution about identifying \\"oppositional readings in texts that seem to reproduce the dominant ideology.\\" In his comprehensive study of Latin devotional literature focused on the Passion, he says that it is difficult to really say who might react to any text in a particular way. Furthermore, Bestul points out that :males are the authors of most of the texts dealt with in [his] study. The perspective on women and women's roles formed in the Passion narratives is, it can be argued, a deeply masculine one, even in the many cases where their intended audience is female. That perspective tends to affirm the rightness of the subordinate position of women in medieval society by constructing an image of the Virgin Mary that largely conforms to male expectations of female behavior and male understandings of female personality, psychology, and appropriate demeanor. He argues that these types of Passion meditations show \\" a male fascination with a woman tormented, passive, and frequently...literally immobilized by suffering,\\" and he goes as far as to speculate that texts like the Quis dabit lament even function to control \\"excessive female devotion to Christ's crucified body.\\" Gender as the category of difference Biddick complained that \\"The model of gender in Holy Feast and Holy Fast assumes that gender is an essence that appears prior to other categories and informs them, that the feminine mirrors, indeed reduces to, the female reproductive function, that the female body is the originary, foundational site of gender.\\"Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". p. 397. Furthermore (as mentioned above in the \\"essentialism\\" section) Biddick observes \\"Bynum calls this sexual difference 'gender,' but for her gender carries the more restricted sense of \\"woman,\\"Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". p. 401. and she argues that a true \\"historical study of medieval gender interrupts this foundational category of Christianitas by asking how a historical construction of gender in medieval Christendom was simultaneously a construction of other differences.\\"Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". p. 403. Taking account of these other differences would, for example, include Jews (and the scandal of the Blood Libel), prostitutes, and homosexuals.Biddick. \\"Genders, Bodies, Borders\\". pp. 401‚Äì9. Hollywood likewise emphasizes that \\"gender is not the only ‚Äì and at times not the most salient ‚Äì category of difference operative within the Christian Middle Ages or any other society.\\"Hollywood. \\"Feminist Studies\\". p. 372 Hollywood draws attention to scholarship on social class, writing, for example, that \\"[Sharon] Farmer finds that 'poor men, as well as poor women, were very much associated with the body.' Without denying that \\"'at various points along the hierarchy of social status' we do find 'that medieval clerical authors . . . make statements that drew stronger associations between women and the body than between men and the body,' Farmer convincingly demonstrates that attention to the differences between servants and elites renders easy generalizations about gender difficult.\\"Hollywood. \\"Feminist Studies\\". p. 372 New questions about the concept of \\"movements\\" As noted above in the section on \\"Feminism, Gender, and the Body: The 'Bynum Thesis,'\\" Caroline Walker Bynum's thinking on religious movements and women's roles in them was influenced by Herbert Grundmann's work. Studies of German historiography from the 1930s to the 1950s or 60s have shown how Grundmann's concept of \\"movements\\" was shaped by a scholarly climate imbued with Nietzschean ideas about how history should \\"serve life.\\" In this context, \\"'life' meant growth and expansion, dynamism, and the kind of creativeness which does not remain fixed in the ideas of the past but painfully transforms itself and gives birth to the new.\\" Study of \\"great men\\" like Charlemagne or Frederick II who were considered to have shifted the course of history was the mode. Others wrote history to \\"glorify man's creative achievements.\\" Grundmann, however, \\"sought to attribute to groups what [others] attributed to individuals-productive vitality, movement, and the urge to create.\\" In doing so, as Jan Gerchow and Susan Marti have written, Grundmann \\"seized on\\" the idea of religious movements as described by Herman Haupt, a Protestant church historian of the previous generation. Haupt, whose scholarship was colored by his Protestantism, regarded the religious movements he described as \\"movement[s] 'from below' against the 'paternalism' of the official (Catholic) church.\\" Gerchow and Marti also speculate that the idea \\"was probably enhanced for Grundmann by the National Socialists having seized power through their own \\"movement\\" (Bewegung). The German Wikipedia page on Grundmann discusses his affiliation with the National Socialist Party. Some German scholars have suggested that the concept of \\"religious women's movement\\" should be avoided \\"at least insofar as it is not clearly distinguished and differentiated from women's movements in modernity, whether the popular evangelical movement against the official church or nationalistic movements of any kind.\\" Yet, Gerchow and Marti write, \\"Complete avoidance of the term...can hardly be expected, as a certain tendentious militancy has been a part of the concept of a \\"women's movement\\" from the very beginning.\\"Gerchow & Marti. \\"'Nuns' Work,' 'Caretaker Institutions,' and 'Women's Movements'\\". p. 146. =Revising the myth of Anselmian origins: questioning the timeline= It has been long known that Anselm's Prayers and Meditations were preceded by a generation in the writings of another Norman monk and abbot, John of F√©camp. And in 1972, Douglas Gray ventured to write in an endnote that :It is hard to believe that (as is sometimes implied) \\"affective\\" devotion suddenly \\"began\\" in the late eleventh century. It is much more likely that fervent and personal devotion to Christ was an aspect of Christian spirituality which was present from the beginning‚Ä¶ even if it was not given such emphatic (or exaggerated) expression as in the Middle Ages‚Ä¶. Probably this strain of personal devotion was taken up and given memorable literary form by powerful intellects like Anselm and Bernard, and with the weight of their authority as leaders and spokesmen of the ascetic and eremitic revival became the accepted and expected form of expression. Michael G. Sargent has written likewise of how affective devotional practices have a long history in the reading and meditative practices (the lectio divina) of Western Monasticism, and Nicholas Watson has described the standard narrative as it relates to Middle English mystical literature as \\"perhaps suspiciously straightforward.\\" Fulton and Saxon Devotion to Christ Rachel Fulton's book, From Judgment to Passion: Devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary, 800‚Äì1200, addresses the question of :how to understand not only how but why this [imaginative, empathetic] devotion to Christ came into being both when and where it did, along with its corollary devotions to the Eucharist and to Mary; how to understand, in other words, both the making and the meaning of this new thing‚Äîif, in fact, it was a new thing and not simply a becoming visible of something already there (as Southern suggested it might be). When Fulton explains the high medieval origins of \\"devotion to Christ in his suffering, historical humanity and to his mother in her compassion\\" she does not dispute the Southern Thesis. Rather, she writes, \\"at no point in the current scholarly discussion is it, in fact, made clear what the historical catalysts may have been for this 'surge of pious devotion,' only the prevailing conditions for that change (monastic tradition, growth of towns, reform of the Church, the status of the laity or of women), some of which themselves were contingent upon that change (new liturgical practices, new artistic representations of Christ and his mother, new theological arguments, the Crusades)(61).\\" Fulton's thesis is that the catalyst was the passing of the millennium and the year 1033 (1000 years after the death of Jesus) without the Second Coming of Christ (63‚Äì64). Her book studies the effects of this :on the life and thought of some of the most prominent (and influential) reformers and intellectuals of the century: Peter Damian (circa 1007‚Äì1072), Berengar of Tours (circa 1000‚Äì1088), Lanfranc of Bec (circa 1005‚Äì1089), John of F√©camp (abbot, 1028‚Äì1078), and Anselm of Canterbury (1033‚Äì1109). As we shall see, the emphasis they placed on, for example, the celibacy of the clergy or the action effected in the sacrament, was itself intricately bound up with their expectations of judgment. To understand the development of the devotion to Christ in his suffering humanity of which these reforms were a part, we must first understand what was at stake in that devotion: the placation‚Äîand repayment‚Äîof the all-powerful, all-seeing crucified Judge. (64) In the words of one reviewer, \\"millennial disappointment in the early mid-eleventh century unleashed a flood of religious, theological, and liturgical responses that helped to shape patterns of devotional response.\\"Wanda Zemler-Cizewski's Speculum review provides a good overview of Fulton's book: Heliand-Fragment P [German Historical Museum, Berlin] The place where Fulton's findings do put real pressure on the Southern Thesis is in her opening chapter, \\"History, Conversion, and the Saxon Christ.\\" In it, Fulton makes a case for how new doctrines of the Real Presence in the Eucharist and new and affectively charged retellings of Bible stories were intrinsic to the ninth century conversion of the Saxons. She focuses in on the Old Saxon historical epic poem, the Heliand (\\"Savior\\"). Written \\"in the alliterative verse traditionally used for vernacular heroic epics,\\" it uses secular oral formulas (Christ is a \\"mead-giver\\" [medomgebon] and the apostles gisi√∞i [\\"warrior-companions, retainers\\"], etc.) These cultural and linguistic translations serve to make the story \\"experientially viable\\" for the Saxon audience (30). The story, however, needed to be not \\"only comprehensible, but urgent,\\" something in which the audience \\"is now compelled to recognize itself\\" (41). But on Fulton's reading, Christ, across the range of Saxon and Anglo-Saxon translations, :was not a Christ for whom sinners were expected themselves to have compassion; this was a Christ in whose presence they could do nothing but pray. Moreover‚Äîas Paschasius himself suggested in his emphasis on the reality of Christ‚Äôs presence at the altar and of the judgment effected in eating unworthily of his flesh‚Äîthe more imminent the moment of judgment, the more impassioned must their prayers become. (59) Implicit here, but not fully articulated, is the suggestion that there was a type of affective devotion and an effort to craft or shock an emotional response, but that the emotions were different than those that would be evoked in later affective devotional practice. Anglo-Saxon affective devotion Likewise in support of pushing the timeline back is the fact that over the years there have been a number or articles on Anglo-Saxon literature that show how many of the features of later medieval affective piety are also found in Anglo-Saxon religious texts. In 1977, Thomas H. Bestul pointed out that \\"there is a significant body of private devotional prayers written in England from about 950 to the end of the eleventh century which anticipates, and occasionally shares in, Anselm's innovations.\\" These prayers \\"share a similar emotionalism in style and a new subjectivity in treating the common penitential themes,\\" Bestul wrote. Bestul has written similarly of continuities between Anselmian prayer and the Irish Tradition. In 1980, John C. Shields published an article on \\"The Seafarer as a Meditatio.\\" Although previous scholars had long thought that The Seafarer is a \\"religious lyric\\" or an \\"elegy\\" (both being genres that rely on emotional expression), Shields argued that the poem \\"may profitably be understood as a meditatio, that is, a literary spiritual exercise whose author aspires to the perfection of the soul.\\" In the same year, Christopher L. Chase published on \\"‚ÄòChrist III,‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Dream of the Rood,‚Äô and Early Christian Passion Piety.\\" Ann Savage pushed this thesis further in 1987 and explicitly aligned poems such as The Wanderer, The Seafarer, and The Dream of the Rood with later affective devotional practice. Christina M. Heckman has written of the imitatio and identification with the Rood (the cross) in The Dream of the Rood along the same lines. Allen J. Frantzen's article, \\"Spirituality and Devotion in the Anglo-Saxon Penitentials\\" (2005), openly questions a tradition of scholarship that has all but ignored Anglo-Saxon religious texts and practices, and he broadens the view out from lyric and elegiac vernacular poetry to include Penitentials, or handbooks listing sins, penances, and prayers. The Penitentials, he points out, emphasize weeping, guilt, and mercy, and :The penitent is the subject rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition is not something that happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs‚Äîby its affectivity, in other words‚Äîwe should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well. Even the \\"lists or catalogues [of sins]\\" Frantzen writes,\\" would have situated the penitent physically and psychologically at the center of a reflective, meditative, and indeed affective process\\" (125). Scott DeGregorio engages in similar polemic in \\"Affective Spirituality: Theory and Practice in Bede and Alfred the Great.\\" In it, he aims \\"to highlight some of the ways these writers anticipate the currents of thought and practice commonly said to mark later medieval devotional literature, and to argue thereby for a more integrated approach to the study of medieval English spirituality.\\" DeGregorio says of Bede's commentary on the Song of Songs that its :language, and more so the range of emotional experiences it seeks to trigger in the individual believer, should be all too familiar to scholars of later medieval devotion, who, bypassing Anglo-Saxon England, rush to make the eleventh and twelfth centuries the terminus post quem for the emergence of affective elements in western devotional literature. (131) Furthermore, DeGregorio writes, \\"a good three centuries before Anselm, Bede saw in Christ‚Äôs crucified body the ultimate \\"text\\" upon which such devotional practice [i.e., meditative reading] should be focused\\" (132). He goes on to argue that not only does Asser's Life of King Alfred describe how Alfred used a private prayerbook for private prayer and meditation, but that Alfred's own writings show that he understood that \\"Reading...is about the construction‚Äîor rather the transformation‚Äîof the individual, a process of internalizing what has been read, of making it one‚Äôs own, such as happens in meditative or spirituality [sic] forms of reading\\" (135). Alfred was, DeGregorio sums up, after \\"a lnd of reading experience that would move him, as an individual, to deeper forms of piety and self-knowledge\\" (135). The Byzantine and late antique evidence In 1988, Sandro Sticca connected the development of conceptions of the Virgin Mary's compassion for her son's sufferings to Byzantine traditions, something that Jaroslav Pelikan also argued in 1996. And in From Judgment to Passion, Rachel Fulton also indicated Byzantine antecedents to Marian devotion. Jean de Beaumetz. Christ on the Cross with a Praying Carthusian Monk. (ca. 1335) [Museum of Art, Cleveland] \\"The picture is one of the 26 panels that once adorned the cells of the Carthusian monastery at Champmol near Dijon.\\" These indications were followed upon in Stephen J. Shoemaker's article on Maximus the Confessor's seventh-century Life of the Virgin. Shoemaker argues that the text offers :a prolonged reflection on Mary‚Äôs role in the events of the crucifixion that relates her boundless grief and envisions her participation in the suffering of her son. Accordingly this text raises significant questions about the development of ‚Äòaffective‚Äô modes of piety and the concept of Marian compassion, both of which are closely linked with meditations on Mary‚Äôs presence at the cross in the later Christian tradition. In particular, this new evidence invites us to rethink certain explanations of these phenomena that would link their genesis to the end of iconoclasm in the East (the ninth century) and the beginnings of the High Middle Ages in the West (the eleventh century). In the case of the Christian East, the importance of this early Life of the Virgin for understanding the emergence of new styles of Marian devotion is unmistakably clear. Yet its potential influence on similar developments in the Christian West is somewhat less certain and difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, even if it may ultimately prove impossible to connect all of the dots between this late ancient text and the piety of the Western High Middle Ages, it seems increasingly clear that we have to reckon with the initial emergence of Marian lament and compassion and affective devotion in rather different historical circumstances than have traditionally been envisaged. Double-sided icon with the Crucifixion and the Virgin Hodegitria (9th Century with additions and overpainting of the 10th and 13th centuries) The Byzantine and Christian Museum, Athens. Shoemaker advances the hypothesis that Western monks could have learned affective devotion to the Virgin Mary from the significant interactions between Western and Byzantine monastic communities, not to mention the interest of reform movements in Eastern ascetic practices. For example, before he became abbot of F√©camp, William of Volpiano had been a reforming abbot at St. Benignus in Dijon, where \\"he received a Greek bishop, Barnabas, into the community, and there were several other Greek monks\\"; and John of F√©camp received his monastic formation under his uncle at St. Begninus (\\"Mary at the Cross\\" 598). In the end, though \\"we cannot be certain that the affective piety and Marian compassion of the High Middle Ages were Eastern imports, we nonetheless must begin to reckon with fact that the emergence of these themes in the eleventh and twelfth centuries was not quite as unprecedented as some have assumed\\" (Shoemaker, \\"Mary at the Cross\\" 606). Arma Christi on Pew Back, Church of St. Valentine (completed in 1493), Kiedrich, Germany In an article on the Late Antique and Patristic antecedents to Arma Christi imagery, Mary Agnes Edsall has demonstrated that visual images of the Arma have antecedents in the rhetoric of Late Antique sermons. Bishops, especially during Lent and Easter Week, would preach on the Passion and would use the resources of their training in rhetoric to craft ekphrases (vivid word-pictures) of the Passion and Crucifixion. In the late-first/early-second century AD, Plutarch described ekphrasis when he wrote of Thucydides' skill as an author: :Thucydides is always striving for this vivdness (enargeia) in his writing, as he eagerly desires to make the listener a spectator, as it were, and to produce in the minds of his readers the feelings of astonishment and consternation which were experienced by those who witnessed the events. One figure of speech good for creating \\"vividness\\" was asyndeton: \\"the omission of conjunctions between clauses, often resulting in a hurried rhythm or vehement effect.\\" Edsall argues that these kinds of ekphrases \\"were ways of knowing, as if having been present at, the suffering and death of Jesus.... their compressed form sharpens the depiction of pain and suffering into an effective instrument of compunction: the piercing realization of personal sin and fear of Hell, or of the grace of Salvation, or even both.\\"Edsall. \\"The Arma Christi Before the Arma Christi\\". p. 41. New directions: rhetorical antecedents, philosophical underpinnings, and history of the emotions =Images, the emotions, and knowing: philosophy and theories of rhetoric= Mary Carruthers Mary Carruthers' trio of books, The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (1990), The Craft of Thought: Meditation, Rhetoric, and the Making of Images (1998), and The Experience of Beauty in the Middle Ages (2013), have driven home the complexity of the blend of theories (medieval and ancient) that described the functions of vision and the emotions in knowledge‚Äîin other words, \\"sense-derived understanding.\\" The following section will summarize those parts of her scholarship that have particular relevance for understanding affective devotional texts and art. The Book of Memory (among many other topics) describes Aristotle's theory of how \\"emotions and even judgements are in some sense physiological processes, although they are more than just that. Memory images produced in the emotional (sensitive) part of the soul, are 'physiological affections (meaning both \\"a change\\" and \\"a disposition to change in a certain way).'\\" \\"Our senses produce 'affects' in us,\\" she writes, \\"physical changes such as emotions, and one of those 'affects' is memory itself....Our memories store 'likenesses' of things as they were when they appeared to and affected us. This analysis...requires that all memory-images have an emotional component, acquired during the process of their formation.\\" The Craft of Thought, focused in on the use (or \\"craft\\") of meditative images, and in this book Carruthers added to the mix the concept of ductus, defined in a later essay as \\"the way (s) that a composition, realizing the plan(s) set within its arrangements, guides a person to its various goals, both in its parts and overall.\\" While on one hand ductus applied to the direction and goal of a whole work, there were places or stages along the way (like the places and images that organized the memory of a speech or a complex idea); and \\"What marks out the variation in route(s) of the overall ductus are figures, modes and colors of the journey.\\" These terms overlap in meaning, having to do with \\"ornaments of rhetoric.\\" These not only introduce variety and interest, they are also related to presentation, emotion, and persuasion. Carruthers writes, :Cicero describes how a successful orator uses ornament abundantly but carefully, each word chosen well. Especially often he should use metaphors \\"because such figures by virtue of the comparisons [they make] transport our thoughts (animos [also the feelings, affections, or passions]), then bring them back, and move them about here and there, and this rapidly changing movement of thought (cogitationes) in itself pleases\\" (Orator, 134).Carruthers. \\"The Concept of Ductus\\". p. 199. Added: Citation and alternate reading of animos A ductus would, hopefully, move people, intellectually and emotionally, through the places of a text to its end, or its intention (intentio) to persuade them one way or another. In The Experience of Beauty in the Middle Ages, Carruthers deepens the analysis of intentio that was also part of the other two books, and lays out three ways that the term is used. These are the interrelated intentiones of the writer/speaker, of the text/speech, and of the reader/auditor. Carruthers summarizes: :Intention is primarily a matter of movement, and the initial artisan's intentions (as a set of chosen movements) are conveyed within his artifact through its planned ductus. One experiencing the work does so through and among the various elements of its ductus, namely its formal and stylistic choices or intentiones. That experience is led (ductus) in the first instance not by moral ideas but by pleasure and delight, the desires (which Augustine called intentiones) of the perceiver responding to the \\"intentions\\" (movements) of the style imparted to it by the \\"intentions\\" (choices) of the artist. To employ Carruthers' insights, an affective meditation, prayer, or piece of art is intended by the author, artist, or compositor to persuade those who read, hear, or behold it by means of the \\"formal and stylistic choices\\" he or she makes. The affective meditation, prayer, or piece of art transmits the intentions inscribed within it‚Äî in a way it has these intentions. The perceiver's intentiones (his or her set of desires shaped by individual memory and social/psychological disposition) respond to the design of the ductus, leading to the perceiver's feeling, knowing, and believing what the text, speech, or piece of art intends. Michelle Karnes Michelle Karnes' book Imagination, Meditation, and Cognition in the Middle Ages (2011) addresses the \\"cognitive work that medieval imagination performs, both in Aristotelian philosophy and in meditations on Christ.\\" She writes that :Creating vivid mental images of Christ‚Äôs sacrifice of himself for humankind heightens affection for him ... I argue that gospel meditations have another, cognitive purpose that becomes visible only when we study the meditations‚Äô references to \\"imagination\\" in concert with medieval philosophical thought about imagination. In other words, \\"such meditations have a theoretical basis...One that will allow us to \\"better understand why imagining Christ's life was considered an especially useful thing to do.\\" Vittorio Crivelli (1450‚Äì1502), Saint Bonaventure Holding the Tree of Life (Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√©, Paris). The Tree of Life (or Lignum vitae) was Bonaventure's most popular meditation on Christ. Bonaventure is a key figure in this study. \\"The particular power of medieval imagination that Bonaventure identified,\\" Karnes writes, \\"arose not from the simple importing of Aristotelian philosophy into the Latin West but from its application to Augustinian theology.\\" Bonaventure, in \\"[r]elying on a newly powerful faculty of imagination...made more powerful the act of imagining the life of Christ, both in his own meditations and, through their influence, in many of those that followed.\\" The \\"Aristotelian imagination,\\"as Karnes calls it, \\"connects the senses to the intellect, providing a certain mechanism for knowledge experience\\" (35). In one reviewer's summary, \\"Imagination is the bridge between the senses and the intellect, a key link between the apprehension of sense data and the comprehension of it through a process of gradual abstraction, refinement and intellectual generalization, a movement from particular observations and the experience of specific sensations to universalizing knowledge, from sensibilia to intelligibilia. The devotional imagination as described by Bonaventure would likewise be a mediator, but \\"between earthly meditation on Christ's humanity and spiritual contemplation of his divinity,\\" and it could do so \\"because it utilized the considerable cognitive and spiritual potential of imagination\\"(61). As Karnes puts it, :in Bonaventure's gospel meditations, imagination harnesses its cognitive power to enable the meditant to conform to Christ in both his natures. The work of meditation is therefore cognitive, as well as affective. Imagination helps the meditant to imagine scenes vividly and feel appropriate emotion, but it also uses the light that shines on it when engaged in the act of knowing in order to lift the meditant to Christ. Bonaventure wants the meditant to love Christ, but also to know him. (112) Rather than inventing gospel meditations or this way of thinking about their aims, Bonaventure provided them with theoretical underpinnings and a method, or \\"mechanism,\\" for making the journey to God (112‚Äì113). They became a means of contemplative, even mystical, ascent in ways that they had not been before (119‚Äì120). For example, in Bonventure's own meditative texts, such as the Tree of Life (or Lignum vitae), \\"ascent to God in heaven proceeds through the mind and through Christ crucified\\" (130). In it, \\"It is imagination that affords the meditant special presence within gospel scenes and provides the mechanism of the meditant's ascent\\" (131). In Bonaventure's words in the Vitis mystica (as quoted by Karnes), :\\"Let us be bound with the bonds of the passion of the good and most loving Jesus, so that we may also share with Him the bonds of love. For, made fast by these latter, He was drawn down from heaven to earth in order to suffer the former. Conversely, we who desire to be drawn from earth into heaven must bind ourselves to the Head with the bonds of the passion, through which we will attain the bonds of love and thus become one with him. (135‚Äì136) Karnes reveals, in the end, the deeply intellectual, philosophical influences on a range of later medieval meditative texts, among other things calling into question the common characterization of meditation on the life of Christ as a genre for the unlettered and the layperson. =History of the emotions and rethinking affective piety= Sarah McNamer Sarah McNamer's book Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion focuses on affective meditations on the Passion as \\"richly emotional, script- like texts that ask their readers to imagine themselves present at scenes of Christ's suffering and to perform compassion for that suffering victim in a private drama of the heart.\\" It breaks ground in using \\"the history of emotion as an additional framework\\" and presents :a new reading of medieval Christian compassion as a historically contingent, ideologically charged, and performatively constituted emotion--and one that was in the broad period considered...(ca. 1050‚Äì1530) one that was insistently gendered as feminine....to perform compassion--in the private drama of the heart that these texts stage--is to feel like a woman, in particular medieval iterations of that identity. Whether scholars agree or not with the idea that, over time and place, cultures have \\"forg[ed] and nourish[ed]\\" links between women and compassion or with the idea that affective piety was primarily associated with the feminine and femininity, McNamer's book offers a new methodology for understanding what affective devotional practices sought to foster in their users: they were \\"mechanisms for the production of feeling.\\" Building on work by Barbara Rosenwein and William Reddy, she argues that affective prayers and meditations \\"are, quite literally, scripts for the performance of feeling‚Äîscripts that often explicitly aspire to performative efficacy.\\" McNamer writes that these scripts are much like William M. Reddy's category of \\"Emotives.\\" In the passage from Reddy as quoted by McNamer, emotives are \\"'first person, present tense emotion claims' that potentially, but not always, function as performatives; they are 'similar to performatives (and differ from constatives) in that emotives do things to the world. Emotives are themselves instruments for directly changing, building, hiding, intensifying emotions, instruments that may be more or less successful.'\\" Notes References Primary texts * Aelred of Rievaulx. \\"Rule for a Solitary\\" in Aelred of Rievaulx: Treatises and Pastoral Prayers.

The motive (found in the of 1625) was an escalation of the Bavarian kingdom's attempt to press the country into the Catholic faith at the time of the Thirty Years' War. History Stefan Fadinger, elected high commissioner of the Traunviertel and Hausruckviertel districts, and the supreme commander of the rebel army In the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, Upper Austria was pledged to the Bavarian Kingdom by the House of Habsburg. The new ruler assumed cuius regio, eius religio (the religion of the ruler dictated the religion of the ruled) and tried to convert the lands to the Catholic faith. In May 1625, the Protestant priest of the Frankenburg am Hausruck parish was replaced by a Catholic priest sent from Bavaria. After an armed uprising, the new priest was forced to flee from the castle. However, the men feared the reaction from Bavaria and surrendered three days later. Adam von Herberstorff, the Bavarian steward of Upper Austria, called all of the men from the region to the Haushamerfeld near Frankenburg to hold the assizes. The 36 men who had led the revolt were among the 5,000 gathered. The court sentenced the men to death, but allowed half of them to go free. Two men would step forward, and one would hang while the other would go. A roll of the dice determined their fate. The steward had thought that the harsh sentence would frighten the peasants, but it only served to increase dissent and give sympathy to the rebels. Over the next year, the peasants secretly prepared for war by recruiting a man from every farmer's house, supplying them with weapons, and teaching them tactics. They intended to attack on the Pentecost, but war had broken out two weeks earlier, when two Bavarian soldiers tried to steal a cow in Lembach. In response, a number of peasants on a pilgrimage near Lembach quickly assembled to slaughter the Bavarian garrison of 25 men. The group continued to collect more recruits on their way to Peuerbach, where they faced Herberstorff and his men. Even before the full size of the peasant army was assembled in Peuerbach, a number of companies attacked them and were quickly defeated. The new commissioners of the region were elected summarily on the battlefield. The 5,000-strong peasant army went on to besiege Eferding, Wels, Kremsm√ºnster, and Steyr, finally arriving at Linz, which did not surrender despite being defended by only 150 Bavarian soldiers. During the siege of Linz, the rebel leader, Stefan Fadinger, was shot. He died on July 5, two weeks after the fatal gunshot. It took months for Bavaria to send troops under Pappenheim's command to relieve the town at the end of August. Steyr was won back on September 26, and Wels on September 27. The war went on until the onset of winter, leaving the countryside destroyed. The farmers were now required to feed the 12,000 Bavarian soldiers who were spending winter in the country. Most of the leaders of the revolt were decapitated over the following months. =Reception= Decapitation of Martin Aichinger Upper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg (German ) in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding.

Unlike other standard theatrical trailers of the era, it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but was a wholly original pseudo- documentary piece. It is considered by numerous film scholars such as Simon Callow, Joseph McBride and Jonathan Rosenbaum to be a standalone short film, rather than a conventional \\"trailer\\", and to represent an important stage in the development of Welles's directorial style. Content The film takes the form of a tour around the film set, while the precise nature of the film is kept under wraps, in keeping with the secrecy built up around the Mercury Theatre's debut feature. This was partly born out of necessity, to prevent William Randolph Hearst from knowing in advance that the film was a satire on his life. The film's producer, director, co-writer and star Orson Welles‚Äîwho was then an established radio star‚Äîdoes not appear in person, but serves as the unseen narrator, introducing members of the cast. There are several specially filmed excerpts of the film in rehearsal, with each member of the principal cast out of costume, reciting a signature line of their character, and stressing that the film's title character prompts extreme reactions from different people. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera. Sloane actually runs into the reflection of the camera in a mirror. The music heard throughout the trailer is the publisher's theme, \\"Oh, Mr. Kane\\". Welles heard the tune, \\"A Poco No\\" by Pepe Gu√≠zar, in Mexico. The special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby. The music was arranged by Conrad Salinger and is heard during the end titles of Citizen Kane. Cast *Ray Collins ... Himself/Jim Gettys *Dorothy Comingore ...

Himself Production The promotional short was filmed at the same time as Citizen Kane itself, and offers the only existing behind-the- scenes footage of the film. It had a slightly different crew, with the director of photography being Harry J. Wild rather than Citizen Kanes Gregg Toland. The trailer was filmed at Toland's suggestion. \\"I wrote the outline of the trailer and shot stuff for it while we were still shooting the movie,\\" Welles recalled. \\"Because you see something that you're doing, and you say, 'That would be good for the trailer, you know?' Even if it wouldn't work in the film.\\"Peter Biskind (ed.), My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2013), p.230. As it is classified as a trailer, no copyright was ever registered on the work, and it is now in the public domain. Consequently, it can now be freely viewed on YouTube, and other video websites. Critical reception and legacy Numerous film critics have treated the trailer as a cinematic work in its own right, arguing it represents a critical stage in the development of Welles's directorial style. Jonathan Rosenbaum has argued that all of Welles's films can be divided into narrative stories and documentary essays. He points to this short as being the first example of the latter from Welles, and that it is particularly important in light of the director's later experiments with the mockumentary format, including It's All True (1942), Around the World with Orson Welles (1955), F for Fake (1973), The Other Side of the Wind (1970-6), Filming Othello (1978), and the later versions of Whatever Happened to Don Quixote? (1957‚Äì85).Jonathan Rosenbaum, \\"Orson Welles's Essay Films and Documentary Fictions: A Two-Part Speculation\\", Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Discovering Orson Welles (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007) pp.129-45. At the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while the film Citizen Kane is frequently cited as a ground-breaking, influential film, Simon Callow argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has \\"great playful charm ... it is a miniature documentary, almost an introduction to the cinema ... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration.\\"Simon Callow, Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu (London: Jonathan Cape, 1995) pp.558-9. Similarly, Welles biographer Frank Brady has written \\"Since the film promised to be unlike any other ever made in Hollywood, Orson wanted the trailer also to be unlike any other. He spent weeks on scripting, shooting, and editing it, and emerged with a punchy and intriguing look at the behind-the-scenes life of the film. It ... stood out from all the other trailers coming out from Hollywood, clarifying that Citizen Kane was going to be something special.\\"Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1989), p.308. In a 2006 essay on the trailer for Citizen Kane, film scholar Paul Salmon notes that the short film has not been included in filmographies by Welles's biographers and is not mentioned in Robert Carringer's exhaustive book, The Making of Citizen Kane. \\"But there is absolutely no doubt about the importance of the work within the context of Welles studies,\\" Salmon writes, \\"especially with respect to its uncanny anticipation of so many of the key debates that have shaped critical discourse on Welles.\\" > The spirit of generosity inherent in Welles's emphasis on introducing the > Mercury Players operates within the parameters set by Welles's role as the > maestro conducting the proceedings, or, to follow Callow, as the master > magician who conjures up all the trailer's tricks. Already, before the > debates around the authorship of Kane, the trailer constitutes a deeply > ambiguous work in terms of Welles's attitude toward collaborative > filmmaking. And while there is a suggestion of disdain for the \\"ballyhoo\\" of > commercial filmmaking, the trailer absolutely revels in show biz and its > deconstruction. Near the end of his career, Welles made one more extended film trailer with wholly original material: a nine-minute F for Fake trailer (1976), made three years after the film itself, in anticipation of the European production's American debut. Availability The Citizen Kane trailer was first made available to a home audience on the 1987 Voyager laserdisc edition of Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane. United States: Distributed by the Voyager Co., 1987, OCLC 422762255 Subsequently, Gary Graver's 1993 documentary Working With Orson Welles contained the trailer, and numerous DVD editions of Citizen Kane have contained the trailer as an extra, including the most recent 2011 Blu-ray release.

His political career hit its first success in 1999 when he was elected into the Abia State House of Assembly to represent Obingwa East State Constituency. In 2003 he was re- elected and subsequently named Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly until Governor Kalu nominated him as deputy governor in 2006. He contested the 2007 Senatorial elections for Abia South Senatorial District on the platform of Progressive Peoples Alliance but lost to Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe in a post election legal battle. On August 18, 2010, Governor Theodore Orji again named him as deputy governor to succeed Chris Akomas. At the swearing-in ceremony, Governor Orji said he chose Nwakanma because Nwakanma has garnered a large wealth of experience as a good follower and would make a visionary and good leader. Eric Acho Nwakanma nursed the ambition of becoming Governor of Abia State at the end of Theodore Orji's tenure by 2015. Initially believed to be the strongest contender for the position, he however lost the bid to his brother-in-law Okezie Ikpeazu. In April 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him as Chairman of the Board of National Neuro Psychiatry Hospital, Enugu. Early life and business Precisely on the 26th of April, 1958 Rt. Hon.

The Patron Bible Society of Nigeria Philanthropy = TAN 91 Foundation= \\"The Acho Nwakanma Foundation 1991-serving people\\" Founded in 1991, The Acho Nwakanma (TAN) Foundation has been disbursing financial grants to indigent women to help them start businesses and be self-reliant. He has donated several motorcycles, tricycles and vehicles to a good number of Abians. He has helped set up and resettle sixty-one NDE graduants. Through the Foundation, he has built houses for some widows in various parts of the State. He is a natural lover of sports and has taken joy in sponsoring sports events in the past decade and a half. He donated a trophy for an Annual Inter Community Football Competition in Obingwa LGA. The Acho Nwakanma Foundation has also over the years been a consistent driver of Sports development in the state and led to the discovery and promotion of many sporting talents who now ply their trade in Spain, Israel, Ukraine, South Africa, and in professional field and track events across Nigeria. He has also been the major non- government sponsor of the Abia Comets Football Club and his joy has been seeing the club rise from little beginnings as an amateur side to becoming a professional team in the Nigeria Football League. He has also sponsored the Women Public Servants Soccer Tournament in Abia State. He has on record over thirty University scholarships which are running at all times. He has at various times donated educational materials to primary and post primary schools in Obingwa LGA and beyond. In 2012 he organized a statewide free- medical scheme. Nwakanma says he has lived most of his life on the principle that the value of a person‚Äôs life can only be measured by how much one has touched the lives of people around. This principle motivated his pursuit and the realization of the 13 kilometer Acho Nwakanma Bypass, a wide road built with stone base and nylon-tar which connects Amuzu Ohanze-Ntighauzo-Ibeme in Obingwa Local Government Area and serves as a major route for travellers between Akwa-Ibom State and Abia State. This road amongst other achievements dwarfs the achievements of his contemporaries. He is currently championing better rights and living conditions for mentally ill persons through his Foundation. He seeks to push through a legislation to protect mentally ill and the destitute at the National Assembly Political life Nwakanma contested for the position of Local Government Council Chairman of Obingwa LGA Abia State in a transition that was scuttled by the military. In 1998, he became one of the founding members of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) and in 1999, he got elected into the Abia State House of Assembly to represent Obingwa East State Constituency. He was re-elected into the Abia State House of Assembly for a second term in 2003. While his membership of Abia Legislative House lasted, he held various House Committee positions which included; *Chairman Finance and Economic Planning Committee *Chairman, Boundary and Security Committee *Member Agric and Rural Development Committee *Member Lands, Survey and Urban Planning Committee; and *Member Public Accounts Committee. As a result of his outstanding performance as a Legislator, he was elected the Deputy Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly a position he held for some years before being nominated as Deputy Governor of Abia State in March 2006 by former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu. He ran for the Abia South Senatorial District Election in 2007 but lost the somewhat controversial election to Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe. He was not deterred but rather chose to remain credible and loyal to the party and leaders of Government and the State. This and more culminated in Eric Acho Nwakanma being nominated again as Deputy Governor of Abia State in August 2010 by incumbent Governor Chief T.A. Orji. He served out as deputy governor for the remainder of the first term of Theodore Orji as governor, leaving office on May 29, 2011 References External links * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Abia State Category:Igbo politicians Category:People's Democratic Party (Nigeria) politicians Category:University of Lagos alumni Category:Government College Umuahia alumni ","title":"Eric Acho Nwakanma"},{"id":"40234136","text":"Anson Southard Marshall (December 3, 1822 ‚Äì July 4, 1874) was an American attorney and politician who served as the United States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire.

She worked to improve the lives of Travellers in Ireland and Northern Ireland from 1981 until her death in 2018. She was the first Traveller candidate in an Irish general election, in 1982.  Family life  Joyce was born Ann O'Donoghue in Clogheen, County Tipperary, in 1940. She was the second of nine children and her parents were John O'Donoghue, a horse trainer, and Nan McCann. Her father was an avid reader who taught his children the history of landmarks and castles they saw on their travels. He read medical works which enabled him to treat many of the illnesses of his children. He spoke Gamin Cant, and could read and write in Irish and English. His wife was illiterate. Joyce's father died in a police cell when she was twelve, and her mother was sent to prison for theft committed to support her family. Joyce took over the role of mother and roamed the country with her siblings. Some years later, she married a Traveller, John Joyce, and they had eleven children. She endured many hardships including prejudice and intolerance, as well as living by roadsides with no facilities, exposed to severe weather, leading to illness and despair. The conditions led two of her daughters to have nervous breakdowns and they were committed to hospitals. Another daughter contracted severe lead poisoning when batteries were dumped at their camp, and she entered long-term care. People dumped their rubbish at Joyce's camp during the 1982 bin-collector's strike, which attracted rats, leading to the death of her one-year-old granddaughter, who caught meningitis from them. She lived for a time in Clondalkin before moving to Tallaght where she began her public life, and later lived in Belfast, where she continued to work for Travellers' rights and well-being.  Public activism  =Entry into public life = Joyce's family from her marriage were living at a halting site in Clondalkin when they were forced out in 1981 by Dublin County Council bulldozers. They moved to Tallaght where Joyce enrolled her children at school. While the family was settling into their new surroundings, the county council tried to open the new Tallaght By-pass, where over a hundred Traveller families lived, without fulfilling their legal obligation to offer them an alternative site. Some angry locals from the settled community threatened the Joyces and other Traveller families, giving them an ultimatum to quit the area. When they refused to move, hostile locals, with the support of some community politicians, organized a vigilante mob to patrol all open space in the area, and they visited the Traveller camp to intimidate them by wielding hurleys and shouting \\"Out! Out! Out!\\", which terrified elderly Travellers and children. Some of the settled Tallaght locals came to the Travellers' defence and stood with them. Broadcaster Gay Byrne also supported them and transmitted his radio programme from the halting site. This gave Joyce her first opportunity to speak publicly on behalf of her community about the injustices they endured. She read the local papers regularly and was disturbed by how they misrepresented the Traveller community: \\"I wouldn't wonder for the settled people to be against us because they were hearing nothing but bad about us,\\" she said. She wrote a Travellers' manifesto describing their needs and delivered it to all the local newspaper offices. She was part of a group of Travellers and settled people who created the Travellers' Rights Committee and held meetings at her home to involve other Travellers. She gave talks around the country to schools, colleges, and convents to educate people about Traveller history and heritage. She and the Travellers' Rights Committee led marches and pickets, and some of these agitations were conducted outside the D√°il. The first Travellers' rights organisation, called Minceir Misli, evolved from the Travellers' Rights Committee in 1983, and Joyce continued her work with them. = Election campaign = Joyce was selected by the Committee to run as a candidate in the general election of November 1982, in the Dublin South-West constituency, becoming the first Traveller to compete for a D√°il seat. She made a documentary for the BBC during her election campaign to improve her support. She petitioned people for votes in the streets of Dublin, wearing a hidden microphone and while being secretly filmed. She received many good wishes but also met people who told her that Travellers were \\"dirt\\" and \\"filth\\" and \\"should be burned\\". Another constituency candidate, Richard O'Reilly, ran to oppose her on an anti-Traveller platform using the slur, \\"Get the knackers out of Tallaght\\" as his campaign slogan. Joyce was not elected but she attracted twice as many votes as O'Reilly.General Election: 24 November 1982, Dublin South West ElectionsIreland.org. Retrieved: 2013-08-12. Shortly after the election, she was arrested and wrongly charged with theft of jewellery. The case attracted widespread publicity but the charges were dropped in court for lack of evidence, although her confidence was damaged. Many believed she was framed because of her campaigning. = Speech to international gathering= She attended a Tr√≥caire seminar in Galway in 1983 where she impressed her seminar group which included Nobel Peace Prize-winner, Se√°n MacBride, and she was selected as chairperson to represent them. She delivered a speech to thousands of attending bishops and humanitarians from all over the world: \\"You people are very concerned about the Third World. I think you should also be concerned about us, we are the fourth world. We live among rats in camps or caravans ... our children suffer from as many diseases as the children of the Third World.\\" She received a standing ovation, and The Irish Times reported that, \\"Mrs Joyce had an extraordinary impact on the seminar, receiving more applause than anyone else who presented reports.\\"The Irish Times, 1983-06-18. = Belfast = She later moved to Belfast for a number of years. There, she created a group to fight for Travellers' rights and lobbied successfully for new halting sites in West Belfast with a fresh water supply, toilets, a playschool, and a clinic for babies. She continued her school visits in the area to explain how important it was that Traveller children learned about their culture and heritage. These visits influenced the schools' use of teaching materials and course content to address Traveller children directly. = Legacy = Joyce was one of the best-known Irish Travellers. She pioneered the cause of Travellers' rights and heightened awareness of the many hidden problems they faced. The existence of the Travellers' Rights Committee in the 1980s fostered many offshoot organizations dedicated to the needs of Travellers. She published Traveller: an autobiography in 1985, which has received scholarly attention,Burke, Mary.

A group of historians named Tietz one of Montana State's four most important presidents in 2011. Early life and education William Tietz was born in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Irma Helen (Neuman) and William John Tietz.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 155.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QKMW- XNGW He grew up in nearby Hinsdale, and graduated from Hinsdale Central High School in 1945.\\"Class of '52 Rolls Out Red Carpet.\\" The Doings of Oak Brook.

May 26, 1977.\\"William Tietz to Head CSU Physiology Department.\\" Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 150:1 (January 1, 1967), p. 566. He immediately pursued a doctorate in physiology and pathology at the Purdue University School of Veterinary Science and Medicine, graduating in 1961.Student Chapter of the AVMA, p. 45. Academic career After receiving his doctorate, Tietz was appointed assistant professor of veterinary physiology at Purdue. He left in 1964 to take a position as an associate professor of radiobiology and physiology at Colorado State University (CSU). He was appointed Chair of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics on March 15, 1967. He later also was named the associate director of the CSU Agricultural Experiment Station. He was appointed CSU's Vice President for Student-University Relations in 1970. He served in the position for a year, during which time he acted as liaison between students and the university in an attempt to keep student unrest low.Hansen, p. 91. On September 1, 1971, he was appointed Dean of the CSU College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.Hansen, p. 43. While dean, he helped found a program whereby Montana State University students could begin their veterinary medical education at Bozeman, and then transfer to Colorado State. Tietz was appointed the ninth president of Montana State University by unanimous vote of the Board of Regents on August 1, 1977. =Montana State University= Tietz had an \\"aggressive, cocky, out-spoken, and dynamic\\" personal style. His governance of the university was very top-down, and controlled by a small, close-knit team of decision-makers. Tietz fought challenges to his authority vigorously. When the state commissioner of higher education told him to do something, he once replied, \\"Don't you tell me how to run Montana State University.\\"Schontzler, Gail. \\"Bill Tietz - the Maverick Who Shaped MSU.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. November 2, 2007. Accessed 2013-08-13. This decision-making style was eagerly embraced by MSU administrators, faculty, and staff, who saw it as the kind of aggressive leadership lacking under the more soft-spoken, behind-the-scenes leadership of the previous president, Carl W. McIntosh.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 156. Tietz believed that Montana State University (MSU) should be far more research-oriented. He encouraged faculty to engage in research, encouraged them to apply for federal research grant money, and required university administrators to seek out federal research funds to expand, renovate, and build new research buildings on campus. Research funding during his tenure rose to $18 million in 1990 from $7 million in 1977. As part of his emphasis on research, he began fully funding the university's teacher development, research development, and sabbatical leave programs. Under Tietz, faculty received full pay for sabbaticals.Under previous administrations, faculty received quarter or one-half pay for sabbaticals, which discouraged faculty from taking them. See: Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 156-157. Tietz arrived at MSU just as a severe, seven-year recession in the state was ending. Economic growth led to higher tax revenues, and this allowed the state legislature to revised the university's funding formula for the first time since the 1950s. Now funding would be based on a wide range of factors that included enrollment, faculty size, and school mission, and be adjusted based on a comparison with 15 other similarly situated colleges and universities in the Rocky Mountain region.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 159. When Tietz arrived at MSU, faculty salaries had declined 23 percent over the past decade and were in the bottom 10 percent nationally. In 1981, under the new formula, Tietz won a 16 percent university-wide budget increase and faculty received a 15 percent pay hike. The 1981 budget boost was followed by several more years of increases. This allowed for a major revamp of the undergraduate core curriculum for the first time in more than a decade. Under Tietz, MSU also expanded its international studies and university honors programs, started the Writing Center, rapidly expanded financial aid (primarily through scholarships), founded the Shakespeare in the Parks program, and founded an Office of Academic Affairs, an Alumni Association, and the Bobcat Boosters alumni network to support sports.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 159, 164. Tietz also greatly expanded Native American programs at MSU (which he believes was one of his most important achievements). The Visual Communications Building, constructed during Tietz's presidency in 1983. Few buildings were constructed under Tietz. However, the state legislature did fund the Visual Communications Building (completed in 1983), the Animal Resources Center (completed in 1984), and the Plant Growth Center (completed in 1987). A third building, the modern home of the Museum of the Rockies, opened in 1989, but this structure was paid for by bonds and not state legislative appropriations.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 161-163. By the end of his tenure, however, planning for a new engineering building had begun. (This structure, the Engineering and Physical Science Building, would not be completed until 1999.) Despite the lack of building, enrollment continued to rise. It hit a then-historic high of 11,311 in 1982. (During the same period, the University of Montana lost 2,000 students in enrollment, despite seeing the number of out-of-state students rise to more than 30 percent of its student body.)Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 164. During his tenure at Montana State, Teitz also established the Advanced Technology Park. The goal was for MSU to act as a high technology development incubator, and then transfer the discoveries made to the private sector. Not only would MSU benefit from licensing and royalty income, but the state economy would grow and jobs would be created. Tietz won a six-month sabbatical in 1984 that allowed him to travel the nation to learn about these tech incubators. (Stanford University, for example, used its tech incubator to spark the creation of Silicon Valley.) But Governor Ted Schwinden believed MSU should continue to focus strongly on agronomy, animal husbandry, and agricultural economics rather than high technology or research.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 178. In 1987, the US West telecommunications company asked seven Western states to submit proposals for the location of its new technology development center (which would bring 1,500 jobs and a critical high technology company to whichever area was chosen). Tietz offered of Advanced Technology Park land and buildings to the company.\\"Foundation Would Donate Land to US West.\\" The Spokesman-Review. June 10, 1987; \\"Montanans Wood US West.\\" Spokane Chronicle. August 11, 1987. But a new recession hit the state the same year, leading to deep cut-backs at MSU.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 170, 175. Tietz worked hard to reverse the cuts, and failed.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 170-177. Schwinden, meanwhile, accused Tietz of \\"duplicity\\" in telling US West that Montana offered a superb location for the new technology center while telling the legislature that MSU was suffering from the budget cuts. Tietz was outraged, calling it an incredible accusationRydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 176. and later saying he had never been so mad in his entire life. The Advanced Technology Park struggled for the remainder of Tietz's tenure at MSU. (It later succeeded in luring a number of small companies to locate there, and as of 2007 had generated 350 new jobs. That same year, Business Week said MSU ranked in the top 10 universities encouraging and making technology transfer.) The final three years of Tietz's presidency were marked by budgetary retrenchment. Tietz said he and his administrators spent 18 hours a day for two weeks to try to meet the cuts required by the legislature (which totalled more than 10 percent). Among the programs cut were membership in the Center for Research Libraries; sports like skiing, women's gymnastics, and wrestling; undergraduate degree programs like business education, engineering science, and industrial arts; and the Office of Institutional Research. The five departments of the College of Education were merged into two. The departments of home economics and physical education were merged, as were the departments of agricultural engineering and civil engineering. Two programs slated for closure were international studies and the School of Architecture. But after bitter battles with the public, students, faculty, professional associations, and the legislature, Tietz was forced to keep them both open.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 173-174. Architecture was saved only because students in the program agreed to tax themselves an extra $190 a semester to pay for faculty salaries. In March 1989, Tietz decided to resign, worn out by the legislative cutbacks and lack of support from the governor. An auditor's report, released in April 1989, showed that researchers had overspent their federal grants by hundreds of thousands of dollars and Tietz had done nothing to rein in costs or stop the spending. (The report might possibly have forced his resignation, but he had already made the decision to retire.) Other roles While serving as dean of the veterinary college at CSU, Tietz was a member of the Council of Deans of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), and served as AAVMC president for a year. While serving as president of MSU, Tietz also held a number of other positions. He was a member of the board of directors of the Montana Energy Research and Development Institute from 1977 to 1985, and served as its chair for two years. He served on the Council of Presidents of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (now known as the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities) from 1977 to 1990, on the board of directors of the Greater Montana Foundation from 1977 to 2004, and on the board of trustees of the Yellowstone Association from 1981 to 1993 (serving as chair from 1987 to 1992). Even though retired, William Tietz remained active in his local community. As of 2007, he served as chair of the Board of Directors of MSU's Burton K. Wheeler Center, and was a member of Gallatin County Detention Center Planning Committee. From 1958 to 2006, he also served on the Conference of Research Workers in Animal Disease. Tietz was made a life member of the group in 2003.\\"CRWAD Dedicated to Winter.\\" JAVMA News. January 15, 2004. Accessed 2013-08-13. Personal life Tietz was married twice. He and his first wife, Patricia Lane Wells Tietz, were married in 1953 and divorced in 1983. They had three children: Karyn, William John Tietz III (known as John), and Julia. A fourth child, Katherine Johanna Tietz, died in infancy. He dated Montana politician Dorothy Bradley for a time until her run for governor in 1992. The two remained friends after their romantic relationship ended. His second wife, the former Gwen Massey, was 25 years younger than Tietz. They lived in Bozeman, Montana, and raised horses. For many years after his retirement, William Tietz got together every few weeks with his MSU VP Stu Knapp, and Carl McIntosh, to discuss current events, Montana State University, the state of Montana, Bozeman, and other topics. The meetings continued until McIntosh and Knapp's deaths.Boswell, Evelyn. \\"The Former Presidents' Club.\\" Mountains and Minds. Spring 2009.

Pierce Mullen, Robert Rydell, and Jeffrey Safford named Tietz one of the four top presidents in the university's history. The others were James M. Hamilton, Roland Renne, and Leon H. Johnson. (Safford said Tietz was even more important than Renne.) Tietz \\"set MSU on the path it still follows today\\", and the group agreed that presidents Michael P. Malone, Geoffrey Gamble, and Waded Cruzado have only built on what Tietz accomplished.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Presidential Debate: Who Were MSU‚Äôs Most Important Presidents?\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. July 17, 2011. Accessed 2013-08-14. William Tietz has won numerous honors throughout his life. Among the more important are the Distinguished Service Award bestowed by the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association in 1976, and the Distinguished Alumni Award bestowed by the Colorado State University School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences in 1977. Upon his retirement in 1990, Tietz endowed MSU with funds to create the President's Native American Excellence Scholarships for American Indian Students. This scholarship goes to a Native American student who has been accepted into the master of arts program in Native American Studies. On November 2, 2007, MSU renamed its Animal Resources Center the William J.

She saw service in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. Originally commissioned into the Royal Navy, she was loaned to Canada in 1941. Background Flower-class corvettes like Hepatica serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Construction Hepatica was ordered on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid on 24 February 1940 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. in Lauzon, Quebec and launched 6 July later that year. Hepatica was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 12 November 1940 at Quebec City. She sailed for Halifax and left harbour on 18 December with a convoy bound for the United Kingdom. She was completed in March 1941 at Greenock. On the 15 May 1941 Heptaica was one of ten corvettes loaned to Canada. She could be told apart from other Canadian Flowers by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships. Hepatica had two extensive refits during her service. She underwent her first from February to April 1943 at New York. The second refit for Hepatica, which saw her fo'c'sle extended, took place beginning in March 1944 and taking until June to complete, also at New York. Wartime service =Royal Navy= After completing at Greenock and working up, Hepatica was assigned to Escort Group EG 4 in April 1941. She served with the unit until her transfer to Canada. =Royal Canadian Navy= Hepatica arrived in June 1941 on loan from the Royal Navy. She was assigned to the Newfoundland Escort Force where she worked with four escort groups over the next eleven months, her longest stint were with groups 23N, from July to September 1941 escorting convoys from St. John's to Iceland and N12, from December 1941 until February 1942, where starting in January, she began escorting convoys from St. John's to Derry. In June 1942, Hepatica transferred to the Tanker Escort Force for one trip, after the U-boat menace was extended to the North American coastline. In late July, she was reassigned to the Gulf Escort Force, escorting convoys between Quebec and Sydney. Later, in October, she was sent to escort the convoys between Quebec and Labrador. Hepatica joined the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in December 1942 and would remain with this force for the better part of the war. In June 1943, she was assigned to escort group W-5 and then in April 1944, W-4. She remained with this escort group for the remainder of her service time with WLEF. In May 1945 she escorted HX 358 back to the United Kingdom, and was assigned to Western Approaches Command for the remainder of the war. Post war service She was returned to the Royal Navy on 27 June 1945 at Milford Haven. Sold on 1 January 1948, Hepatica was broken up at Llanelly, Wales.

Medicine In his early adulthood, Norwood worked as a printer, and studied science and medicine. In 1836, upon completion of a thesis on spinal diseases, he graduated from Transylvania Medical College in Lexington. In 1840 he was appointed chair of the surgery department of the Madison Medical Institute in Indiana, and from 1843 to 1847 he was chair of the medical school at St. Louis University. Geologist Beginning in 1847, he shifted careers to geology. From 1847 to 1851 he worked for David Dale Owen performing field survey throughout Wisconsin Territory and Iowa. In 1851 he was appointed Illinois State Geologist. During this period, he was a middleman in the discovery of the first dire wolf specimen. In 1858 he was dismissed from the Illinois job under acrimonious and politically motivated circumstances. He was immediately offered and accepted the same position for the State of Missouri. Academia From 1860 to 1880, Norwood's career shifted to academia when he was offered the position of professor of natural sciences at the University of Missouri. In 1872 he was appointed dean of the new School of Medicine, the first public school of medicine west of the Mississippi. In 1880 his health declined after a fall, and until his death in 1895 he held the title of professor emeritus in physics. When he died he was given full honors by the university, and in 1904 Norwood Hall at the Missouri University of Science and Technology was named for him. Throughout his career Norwood was a prolific publisher, writing on subjects ranging from medicine to chemistry to geology. Norwood was married twice, to Louisa Taylor and later to Mary Francis Pugh. He had three children by the first marriage and eight by the second marriage. His son Charles Norwood became a Kentucky State Geologist.

The opening of the program uses the song \\"Fuego\\" by Bomba Est√©reo, and mixes images of the history of Argentina with images of Ch√°vez characterized as a political puntero. For this purpose he grew his sideburns, used hair extensions, 1970s shirts and chains. The program did not have a fixed filming set, and filmed scenes at several real villa miserias. Plot The miniseries is set in a Villa miseria in Greater Buenos Aires, ruled by mayor I√±√≠guez since 1987. Pablo Aldo Perotti, known as the \\"Gitano\\", works in the clientelist relation between the poor people and the political authorities. Perotti wants to be the new mayor, and to return with his former wife Clarita. At the end of the miniseries, Clarita becomes the new mayor, and Perotti ends up in a psychiatric institution Reception The program won the 2011 Mart√≠n Fierro Awards for best miniseries actor (Julio Ch√°vez) and best miniseries.

The works were built to exploit the high-quality iron ore and low-sulphur coal found in the area. Low Moor made wrought iron products from 1801 until 1957 for export around the world. At one time it was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire, a major complex of mines, piles of coal and ore, kilns, blast furnaces, forges and slag heaps connected by railway lines. The surrounding countryside was littered with waste, and smoke from the furnaces and machinery blackened the sky. Today Low Moor is still industrial, but the pollution has been mostly eliminated. Background The ironworks depended on the excellent resources of high-quality coal and iron ore found in the vicinity. The \\"better bed\\" coal came from a seam about thick resting on hard sandstone. This coal is particularly low in sulphur. About above this coal seam there is a layer of \\"black bed\\" coal. The ironstone lies above this layer, holding about 32% iron. The Halifax coal beds lie about below the better bed. At the time the ironworks were developed recent technological advances had made it practical to smelt iron using coal rather than charcoal and to use steam engines to power the steps in production of iron goods. Most of the land occupied by the iron works was part of the Royds Hall estate. Operation of a coal mine on the estate is mentioned in 1673. In 1744 the owner, Edward Rookes Leeds, began to actively develop the coal mines. About 1780 a wooden railway was built from the Low Moor mines to the coal yard in the centre of Bradford, from where the coal could be carried via the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Soon after, Leeds went bankrupt. The property was twice offered for sale by auction, in December 1786 and October 1787, but no suitable offer was made. Leeds committed suicide in 1787. In 1788 the estate was sold to a partnership of Richard Hird, a country gentleman, John Preston and John Jarratt for ¬£34,000. After some sales of shares the partners were Richard Hird, Joseph Dawson, a minister, and John Hardy, a solicitor. Dawson was interested in metallurgy and chemistry and was a close friend of Dr. Joseph Priestley. He seems to have been the prime mover in the enterprise. The partners planned to found an ironworks, and engaged an engineer from Wigan named Smalley to build the blast engine. Smalley called on Thomas Woodcock to prepare plans for the furnaces, casting houses and other works. Woodcock moved to Low Moor, and was to be architect and general manager until his death in 1833. Expansion Blast furnace for production of pig iron. Later the Low Moor furnaces used self-tipping wagons to deliver ore, coke and limestone. Construction of the plant began in June 1790, including blast furnaces and casting shops. The furnaces had square bases, tapering as they rose to about in height. The two furnaces were blown in on 13 August 1791 and the first casting was made by the forgemen three days later. At first the works produced domestic goods, but soon began producing industrial products including parts for steam engines. In 1795 the company won contracts to provide guns, shot and shells to the government, which had been at war with revolutionary France since 1793. By 1799 the works were producing about 2,000 tons of pig iron per year, from which iron goods were made that ranged from columns used in mill construction to garden furniture. In 1800, the company opened the Barnby Furnace Colliery on land leased from Walter Spencer Stanhope. This mine worked the \\"Silkstone Seam\\". In 1802 the Low Moor Furnace Waggonway was constructed connecting the colliery to Barnby Basin on the Barnsley Canal. The colliery had closed by May 1807. The waggonway was replaced in 1809 by the Silkstone Waggonway which ran over much of its trackbed, and operated until 1870. The ironworks were owned by the families of the founders throughout the 19th century, with the addition of the Wickhams, who married into the Hirds. The annually employed capital grew from ¬£52,000 in 1793 to ¬£250,000 in 1818. The company started to produce wrought iron in 1801, at first using imported iron but by 1803 using Low Moor pig iron. In 1803 a regiment of volunteers was formed at Low Moor ready to repel the expected French invasion. The works were gradually mechanised. By 1805 there was a self-tipping inclined railway to charge the furnaces, a nail slitting mill, two nose-helve hammers and a plate-rolling mill. As the iron works grew, the company built workers' cottages in the district that took the name of North Brierley and a hostel for the boys who worked in the pits. The boys were given free clothing and schooling. The company also ran several public houses. By the end of the war with France in 1814 the works were producing 33 tons of pig iron weekly. Prices fell for a while as demand slackened after the war, but demand for gas pipes and street lights began to pick up in 1822. The Airedale poet John Nicholson wrote in 1829, By 1835 the works were handling a growing volume of orders. There was no room to expand in the original site, which was crowded by industrial works, offices and workers houses. Construction started on a new site to the southeast, and in 1836 two oven-topped blast furnaces came into operation there. In 1842 the company installed a new mill to roll iron plate for engine boilers. In 1843 four pairs of forge hammers were installed, driven by steam engines, and in 1844 the company decided to install one of James Nasmyth's newly invented steam hammers. Process Puddling furnace (1881 illustration) The process to convert ore into pig iron and then into wrought iron involved first converting the coal to coke to remove water and sulphur, a process that took 48 hours if done in piles in the yard, or 24 hours if done in ovens. About 32% of the better bed coal would be lost in coking. The ironstone was allowed to weather for some time to free it from shale. Limestone was brought from Skipton to help separate clay from the iron ore. In 1832 it took of coal, of limestone and of ironstone to make of pig iron. The ironstone was baked with coke and limestone in a kiln, then emptied into a furnace, from which it came out as ore. This was cast into pigs with crystalline or granular structure, and then refined by cold blast, coming out flaky. There were four blast furnaces, with the air delivered by powerful steam engines. The iron was then puddled, becoming granular and malleable. The steam hammers forged the glowing iron into malleable slabs, which were rolled into wrought iron plates. Large quantities of slag from the blast furnaces were sold for use in road-making. Full production James Nasmyth's patent steam hammer Robert Wilson, Works Manager at James Nasmyth's Bridgewater foundry in Patricroft near Manchester, had improved Nasmyth's 1842 design for a steam hammer, inventing the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer ‚Äì a critically important improvement. Nasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range. Nasmyth's first steam hammer was built for the Low Moor Works. They rejected the machine, but on 18 August 1843 accepted an improved version with a self-acting gear. From 1845 to 1856 Robert Wilson was employed by the Low Moor Ironworks. While at Low Moor he improved the steam hammer with the \\"circular balanced valve\\". In the Great Exhibition of 1851 at the Crystal Palace in London the ironworks exhibited an enormous cannon. The company also provided samples of ore, coal, pig iron and wrought iron, a smaller gun, a sugar cane mill, an olive mill and an elliptograph. The Low Moor company bought the Bierley Ironworks in 1854. By 1855 Low Moor was producing 21,840 tons of iron per year, and was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire. The foundries at Low Moor produced quantities of guns, shells and shot for troops fighting in the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56) and the Indian Mutiny (1857‚Äì58). The arms business declined after this, as the government increasingly took charge of weapons production. The works turned to making weldless railway tyres, steam engine boilers, sugar pans for refineries in the West Indies, water pipes and heavy iron components for industrial purposes. By 1863 there were 3,600 employees at the works including 1,993 miners, 420 furnacemen, 770 forgemen and 323 engineers. In 1864 a second steam hammer with an 8-ton ram was installed for heavy forgings. In 1871 a third steam hammer of 7 tons was installed. New rolling mills were also built to meet demand for iron plates in shipbuilding, supplied by slabs forged in the works. By 1867 there were about 4,000 employees. A description of the works at that time said In 1868 617,628 tons of Low Moor ironstone were raised, the peak production. In 1876 about 2,000 coal miners were employed in pits ranging in depth from in the surrounding townships of North Bierley, Tong, Bowling, Shelf, Wyke, Clifton, Hipperholme and Cleckheaton. Thirteen pumping engines were used to drain water from the mines. The company also employed about 800 miners in collieries to the east at Beeston, Churwell, Osmondthorpe and Potternewton, near Leeds. Minerals were carried to the works by horse-drawn wagons or by wagons on tramways drawn by stationary engines. The Low Moor mines produced about 60,000 tons of ore yearly by 1876. The iron was prized for its uniform and brilliant grain, commanding premium prices. The quality seemed to be due in part to the nature of the ore and coal and in part to the manufacturing process. Production came at the cost of aesthetics. An 1876 description said \\"the natural effect of the perpetual smoke-canopy under which the vegetation of the district exists is to give to it a dinginess not pleasant to look upon... The appearance created by the works themselves and their surroundings has been not inaptly likened to that in the vicinity of the crater of some volcano.\\" Decline Low Moor industrial area in 2007 Monument to the Low Moor Iron Works The company began to run into difficulty in the late 1880s. Its mines were increasingly scattered and expensive. The rail network had a variety of gauges and used a mix of stationary engines and locomotives. Some of the plant was obsolete and operations were generally inefficient. However, there was continued demand for \\"Best Yorkshire Iron\\" for applications where safety was critically important. In 1888 Low Moor was converted to a limited liability company, although descendants of the founders retained control. The directors planned two new blast furnaces at the New Works, each high, with capacities of 340 and 240 tons per week. The first came into operation in 1892. In 1905 an electrical power station was built at the New Works, with boilers fired by gas from the blast furnaces. Apart from the heaviest machines, steam drives were replaced by electrical drives. The outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì1918) caused a temporary surge in demand for shell casings and drop forgings, including shoes for the tracks of the first tanks. After the war it was clear that future demand for wrought iron was uncertain. The company was taken over by Robert Heath & Sons of Staffordshire, creating a new company called Robert Heath And Low Moor Ltd. Efforts were made to reduce costs, although this affected quality. Attempts to use high-sulphur coal created serious problems and destroyed the reputation of the works as a supplier of high quality iron, while a slump in heavy industry in the 1920s further reduced demand. The company poured money into attempts to diversify the operations, but did not succeed. In 1928 the company was declared bankrupt, and the Low Moor assets bought by Thos. W. Ward Ltd. Many of the mines, tracks and plant were closed or dismantled. Some buildings were sold or leased to other companies, and some plant was modernised. Wrought iron production finally ended in 1957. As of 1971 new owners were producing alloy steel, making about 350 tons per week.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Kamsack, Saskatchewan. Background Flower- class corvettes like Kamsack serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction The launch of Kamsack ‚Äì 5 May 1941. Kamsack was ordered on 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 20 November 1940 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. in Port Arthur, Ontario and launched 5 May 1941. Kamsack was commissioned on 4 October 1941 in Quebec and arrived at Halifax on 13 October for workups. During her career, Kamsack had two major refits. The first refit took place at Liverpool, Nova Scotia beginning on 12 November 1942 and was completed at Halifax 18 January 1943. The second major refit took place in Baltimore, Maryland from December 1943 and took until mid-March 1944 to complete. During this second refit, Kamsack had her fo'c'sle extended. Service history =War service= Stand easy in the stoker's mess of Kamsack After workups, Kamsack initially joined Sydney Force. However, in December 1941, she began her service with the Newfoundland Escort Force as part of escort group N13. In April 1942, Kamsack joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) for two months as a part of escort group C-3. In June 1942, she transferred to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF), with whom Kamsack would spend the rest of the war with. As a member of WLEF, in June 1943 she was assigned to escort group W-4 and in April 1944, group W-3. =Postwar service= Kamsack was paid off on 22 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was quickly sold to the Venezuelan Navy who purchased her later that year. Renamed ARV Carabobo, she was wrecked during passage to Venezuela in December 1945.

It is a sexually transmitted disease, though an infant may be infected during birth. Description It has an elongated shape and its cells possess two internal compartments, one packed with granules, the other filled with coarse granules (consistent with ribosomal structures). The organism has properties of adherence through a specific organelle called the tip organelle. M. Penetrans has a coding sequence (MYPE1570) similar to that of MYPE470 in Mycoplasma pneumoniae which codes for an accessory protein that aids in cytadherence, the adherence to respiratory epithelium. This similarity suggests M. penetrans could attach to host cells through cytadherence. Also, the CDS MYPE1550, which is near MYPE1570, of M. penetrans is orthologous to the hemadsorption protein HMW2 of M pneumoniae, suggesting the potential for M. penetrans to attach to and invade red blood cells.  Virulence factors  Mycoplasma penetrans, like many bacteria, exhibits a mechanism by which it can avoid an immune response in the host cells. This avoidance of immune responses is known as a virulence factor. The virulence factor that M. penetrans displays is antigenic variation, the ability to exchange or switch antibodies against which the host cell produces antibodies. The mpl gene encodes for the bacteria's antigens and, like most genes, it contains a promoter region. In M. penetrans, this promoter region can undergo reversible inversion, allowing for variation in antigen production and, thus, the source for M. penetrans antigenic variation.  Diseases  Mycoplasma penetrans has been shown to hinder p53, a tumor suppressing gene that aids in regulating the cell cycle. There have also been cases of malignant pleural effusion, when patients exhibited chronic M. penetrans infection with various immunodeficiencies (such as HIV infections or anticancer treatment). This particular species is also a sexually transmitted disease and one cause of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Its type strain is DSM 6242. Methanococcoides burtonii is an extremophilic archeon of the family Methanosarcinaceae, a family of three genera of coccus-shaped cells. Methanococcides burtonii has adapted to life in Antarctica where it resides in Ace Lake at temperatures that remain permanently 1-2 ¬∞C. M. burtonii was first discovered by an Austrian limnologist named Harry Burton. It was determined that the optimal temperature of growth was 23 ¬∞C. M. burtonii is able to grow on methylated substrates and tolerates a broad range of growth temperatures (< 4¬∞ to 29 ¬∞C). The cold adaptation in M. burtonii involves specific changes in membrane lipid unsaturation and flexible proteins. M. burtonii are irregular cocci, ranging 0. to 1.8 micrometers in diameter. M. burtonii occur singly or in pairs. During Gram staining, cells lysej; they also lyse in hypotonic solutions. M. burtonii are motile with a single flagellum, and lack storage structures and internal membranes in the cytoplasm. M. burtonii are colony- forming archaea, usually occurring in <1 millimeter colonies that are circular and convex. Cells of M. burtonii fluoresce blue when exposed to UV illumination. The optimal initial pH for growth is 7.7. Two substances found to stimulate growth are yeast extract and trypticase soy agar. M. burtonii cells were found to be resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, vancomycin and erythromycin. Although it has evolved the ability to sustain itself in what are considered \\"extremophilic\\" environments for archaea (1-2 ¬∞C), M. burtonii optimally grows at 23 ¬∞C. M. burtonii is an obligately methylotrophic methanogen able to use methylamines and methanol, but not formate, H2CO2, or acetate for growth. Methane is a greenhouse gas, and methanogens play a critical role in global warming and the global carbon cycle via the production of methane.  Cold Adaptation  M. burtonii are thermally regulated, thus highlighting the role that energy generation and biosynthesis pathways play in cold adaptation. proteomic research shows that cellular levels of subunit E are higher during growth at low temperatures. This could possibly indicate that Subunit E is fulfilling a specific role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in low temperature growth or in facilitating transcription at low temperature in general. M. burtonii have regulatory mechanisms resembling those found in cold shock induced RNA helicase genes from E. coli. Thus, these mechanisms have similarity with bacterial methods of cold adaptation. M. burtonii have decreased levels of DnaK and increased levels of PPIase at 4 degrees Celsius possibly indicating the protein folding is a thermally sensitive process and may contribute to its adaptation to the cold. A number of genes involved in methanogenesis are thermally regulated, and regulation involves the expression of genes in operons, protein modification, and the synthesis of Pyrrolysine containing TMA-MT. At 4 ¬∞C higher levels of protein and/or mRNA are expressed for genes involved in methanogenesis which produces a proton motive force that drives cellular processes including ATP synthesis, and pathways from acetyl-CoA leading to amino acid metabolism. M. burtonii have increased levels of GDH and GAPDH (key enzymes in nitrogen and carbon metabolism) at 4 ¬∞C indicating that there is an effective regulation of fundamental processes of carbon and nitrogen metabolism consistent with the evolution of the organism for growth in the cold. = Membrane Structure and Flexible Proteins = It is known that Archaea represent a large proportion of the microbial biomass in ‚Äúcold‚Äù environments, i.e., Ace Lake where M. burtonii was discovered. As environmental temperature decreases, the lipid bilayer becomes rigid in a majority of wild type organisms. However, it has been discovered that increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane can sustain a liquid crystalline state. To accomplish this a desaturase enzyme is utilized. De novo synthesis allows for a permanent adaptation to cold environments, as is observed in M. burtonii. It was determined that the presence of unsaturated diether lipids (UDLs) provides a mechanism of cold adaptation in archaea. Certain UDLs have been discovered in M. burtonii. These UDLs are temperature sensitive, and growing them at different temperature affects the rate of unsaturation in the membrane. Thus, this provides evidence that M. burtonii has the ability to control its membrane fluidity (with respect to temperature). This ability therefore provides a plausible pathway to cold adaptation by archaea. Other molecules potentially responsible for membrane unsaturation, and thus cold adaptation, are isoprenoid side chains. Two specific enzymes, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase were discovered to participate in the melavonate pathway in M. burtonii. Isoprenoid chains produced in this manner are fully unsaturated. A higher content of noncharged polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr and a lower content of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly Leu have been found in M.burtonii. GC- content is the major factor influencing tRNA stability in this organism. A proteomics approach using two-dimensional chromatography-mass spectrometry found major phospholipids were archaeol phosphatidylglycerol, archaeol phosphatidylinositol, hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylglycerol, and hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylinositol. All phospholipid classes contained a series of unsaturated analogues, with the degree of unsaturation dependent on phospholipid class. The proportion of unsaturated lipids from cells grown at 4 ¬∞C was significantly higher than for cells grown at 23 ¬∞C. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase were identified in the expressed proteome, and most genes involved in the mevalonate pathway and processes leading to the formation of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol were identified in the genome sequence. M. burtonii ICAT Proteome: Protein extracts from M. burtonii cultures grown at 4 ¬∞C and 23 ¬∞C were labeled with the ICAT reagent and digested with trypsin. ICAT-labeled peptides were isolated using affinity chromatography. 163 proteins were identified.  Genome Structure and Evolution  Genome sequencing for M. burtonii revealed a single circular chromosome encompassing 2,575,832 base pairs. The M. burtonii genome is characterized by a higher level of aberrant sequences in composition than any other archeon. M. burtonii has the ability to accommodate highly skewed amino acid content while retaining codon usage. This has been a major evolutionary step in cold adaptation. In a study using COG_scrambler, a number of significant gene sets in the M. burtonii were overrepresented. Significantly, overrepresented COG's consisted of signal transduction histidine kinases, REC-A superfamily ATPases and Che-Y like response regulators, along with numerous transposases. Moreover, in comparison to archaeal genome sets M. burtonii's genome has overrepresented sets of genes in defense and motility mechanisms, while underrepresented in categories of nucleotide translation and nucleotide metabolism. = ABC Transporters = M. burtonii has a distinct lack of identifiable ABC transporters for peptides. This lack of identifiable ABC-transporter permease for peptides constitutes a major difference between M. burtonii and other members of its family: Methanosarcineae. Therefore, this lack of peptide transport accompanies their inability to utilize peptides for growth. = Metabolism = M. burtonii has the capacity for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It produces acetyl-CoA from methyl-tetrahydrosarcinapterin and carbon dioxide. The enzyme used in this pathway is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase. M. burtonii possesses a type-III ribulose,1-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, however no identifiable gene for phosphoribulokinase has been found. Therefore, M. burtonii cannot accomplish carbon fixation by RubisCO. Also, M. burtonii has ADP-dependent sugar kinases used in glycolysis. When energy levels are low and/or the environment is anaerobic, M. burtonii utilizes ATP via this pathway given the ability of ATP synthesis through 3-PGA. = Amino Acid synthesis = M. burtonii produces cysteine via the tRNA-dependent pathway and the O-acetylserine pathway. Pyrrolysine is produced using the enzyme pyrrolysyl- tRNA synthetase. = Methanogenesis = M. burtonii obtains its energy from the oxidation of methyl groups to carbon dioxide and reduction to methane; hence it is called an \\"obligatory methylotrophic methanogen\\". For methanogens, growth in the presence of hydrogen require three separate hydrogenases: ECh, Frh/Fre, and Vho; M. burtonii does not contain any of these. M. burtonii does not use formate, H2:CO2 or acetate for growth. = Signal Transduction = The genome of M. burtonii also includes a chemotaxis mechanism consisting of a chemotaxis protein, a chemotaxis histidine kinase CheA, and a chemotaxis response regulator. M. burtonii participates in environmental sensing via a variety of protein kinases. M. burtonii is a strict anaerobe that possesses intracellular kinases that are used in recognition of oxygen. These kinases also recognize other elements crucial to its survival.

Running east-west on the North side and roughly parallel to the Missouri River the trail began in the river port of St. Charles. The trail played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States and the development of Missouri's statehood. The trail's eventual terminus at Franklin was the start of the better-known Santa Fe Trail. First traced by the sons of Daniel Boone, the path originally ended at a salt lick in Howard County used by the pair to manufacture salt. Today the lick is maintained as Boone's Lick State Historic Site. The salt spring known as \\"Boon's Lick\\" in Howard County, Missouri. History A large area in central Missouri became known as the Boonslick, or \\"Boonslick country.\\" It was the core of a larger area eventually known as Little Dixie, because it was settled primarily by migrants from the Upper South, who developed hemp and tobacco plantations dependent on enslaved African-American workers. Parts of the trail eventually were improved or developed as paved roads. Its route is the forerunner to today's U.S. Highway 40 and Interstate 70. Towns founded along the trail include Franklin, Smithton, Columbia, Fulton, Williamsburg, and Warrenton among others. Route The trail began at the Missouri River port of St. Charles, Missouri, a late colonial town, and struck a westward path through present-day St. Charles, Warren, Montgomery, Callaway, Boone and Howard counties. Different shortcuts were made on the trail as towns and county seats were founded, especially in Boone and Callaway counties. Major streams crossed include Cedar, Roche Perche, and Moniteau creeks. The route was followed by Joseph Smith and his followers, members of the new Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1830s and 40 on their way to establish the settlement of Far West, Missouri. \\"Two More Mormon Trails: The Boonslick Trail; The Mississippi Saints‚Äô Trail\\", Ensign, August 1979, p. 49.

This type of adaptation is context-dependent and hence, is specific to the environment in which the adaptation occurred. The Central nervous system, particularly the cerebellum, underlies this form of adaptation in vertebrates. It is suggested that the nervous system learns to predict and cancel effects of a novel environment, returning movements to near baseline (unperturbed) conditions. During motor adaptation the nervous system constantly uses error information to improve future movements.  Split-Belt Adaptation  Schematic of motor adaptation. Depicted to the left is a cartoon representation of a subject walking on a split-belt treadmill during which the left leg is driven to walk slower than the right. Shown to the right is the process of split-belt adaptation which involves a disruption and then recovery of step length symmetry at the onset and termination (bottom right) of the change in speed across the left and right treadmill belts (top right) Split-belt adaptation is a sub-type of motor adaptation in which the limbs on each side of the animal's body are driven at different speeds. This is achieved through the use of a split-belt treadmill that consists of two independently controlled treadmill belts. Animals undergoing split-belt adaption adjust their interlimb coordination pattern to regain overall gait symmetry. Split-belt adaptation has a notable after-effect period (limbs driven at the same speed) in which the interlimb coordination pattern remains altered from that during the pre-adaptation period for some time after the split-belt perturbation period. The after-effect, however, is context- dependent and therefore, will only exist in the same locomotor environment in which the adaptation had occurred. Moreover, split-belt adaptation has spatial (placement of the limb) and temporal (timing of limb movement) components that are dissociable at the behavioral and circuit level. The adaptation rates of the two components are different where the adaptation of the temporal component is faster than that of spatial component. In vertebrates, the cerebellum is suggested to facilitate split-belt adaptation, and in mice, the interposed cerebellar nucleus is particularly crucial for this form of adaptation. Additionally, somatomotor regions of cerebral cortex in mice are shown to be not involved in split-belt adaptation. The split-belt adaptation paradigm is clinically important for aiding in the adjustment or recovery of impaired limb coordination patterns resulting from injury or pathologies, as well as understanding the specific aspects (e.g. temporal or spatial components) of gait that are disrupted in gait pathologies.  After-effects  As demonstrated in the chart, when the environmental forces are removed, the subject reserves, for a limited time, the adaptive movement pattern (stage 4). This motor after-effect demonstrates that the learner does not merely react to environmental changes but also anticipates the expected dynamics of the new environment and moves according to a new set of expectations. Therefore, motor adaptation appears to rely on an update in the internal representation (internal model) of the external environment. Motor Adaptation  Internal model  The after-effects phenomena suggests that prior to the movement, the CNS generates an internal-model, a sort of internal-map that guides the body in the course of the movement, and adapt to environmental forces. This observation suggests that in programming the motor output to the muscles of the arm, the CNS uses an internal model (Wolpert et al., 1995b) to predict the mechanical dynamics of the task. Motor adaptation is a robust phenomenon and was also found in monkeys and mice performing motor tasks. Using optogenetics the study, done by Dr. Mackenzie Mathis at Harvard University, using mice could also show that somatosensory cortex is involved in updating the internal model.

UNICEF Malaysia is one of over 190 national offices of the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund. Since its establishment in 1954, UNICEF Malaysia has been on the ground to uphold the rights of children in Malaysia, including their right to an education, healthcare and protection from abuse and exploitation. It also advocates for political change in support of children, and works with partner organizations from the public, charity and private sectors, to effect change. It is a Malaysian affiliate of the UNICEF. Overview UNICEF Malaysia is one of over 190 country offices and national committees of the United Nations Children's Fund. Guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF has a universal mandate to promote and protect the rights of all children, everywhere ‚Äì especially those hardest to reach and most at risk. UNICEF has been working with the Government of Malaysia since 1954 by supporting programmes in health, nutrition, water and sanitation, formal and non-formal education as well as services for deprived children in poor urban areas. UNICEF's work in Malaysia has since evolved with the nation‚Äôs development and progress into an upper-middle income country. In addition to helping provide children the best start in life through quality health and education as well as protection from violence, exploitation and abuse, the UN children's agency also works with its partners in Government and civil society to reduce child poverty and engages with businesses to promote child-friendly corporate social responsibility. The 2011-2015 Country Programme links policies and programmes through a combination of ‚Äòupstream‚Äô and ‚Äòdownstream‚Äô work to effect change in the lives of children and their families. This includes using data and good practices to advance and support policies promoting child rights and helping Malaysia invest in children and families by formulating and implementing laws that benefit them. UNICEF is an intergovernmental organisation (IGO) and thus accountable to its host government. It is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. Convention on the Rights of the Child The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is a human rights treaty which upholds the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of all children below 18 years. Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, the CRC defines the universal principles and standards for the status and treatment of children worldwide. Two optional protocols were adopted on 25 May 2000. The First Optional Protocol restricts the involvement of children in military conflicts, and the Second Optional Protocol prohibits the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. A third optional protocol relating to communication of complaints was adopted in December 2011. The CRC spells out a specific role for UNICEF, in its capacity as the UN body responsible for the rights of children. UNICEF is required to promote the effective implementation of the CRC and to encourage international co-operation for the benefit of children. UNICEF is also entitled to be represented when each country‚Äôs implementation of the CRC is considered by the Committee every five years. Malaysia ratified the CRC in 1995 and the First and Second Optional Protocols in 2012.

They were originally formed in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1988. The core membership consists of singer-guitarist Peter Aaron, guitarist William Gilmore Weber III, drummer Bob Bert, and bassist Jerry Teel. The Chrome Cranks ca. 1996: L to R, Jerry Teal, Bob Bert, William Gilmore Weber III and Peter Aaron History Aaron and Weber moved together through a variety of projects in Cincinnati starting in early 1986; The Chrome Cranks began to jell in 1988, though they went through a period of woodshedding that lasted for nearly two years, and during this time the lineup was constantly changing. They did not play out until 1990, on a date opening for Pussy Galore which included future member Bob Bert. With Aaron finally established as singer, the group first recorded in 1991 for an Atavistic Records compilation, Out of Their Mouths and Into Your Head. The Chrome Cranks subsequently took a brief hiatus as Weber moved to New York City later that year; during a return visit, however, Weber rejoined the band to record its first single. Despite that Weber subsequently joined GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, Aaron also moved to New York City in 1992 and re-established The Chrome Cranks, adding former Honeymoon Killers guitarist Jerry Teel on bass. They signed with PCP Entertainment, a label distributed by Matador Records. After moving through a succession of drummers, Bob Bert joined The Chrome Cranks in the summer of 1994. He first appeared on The Chrome Cranks' second album, Dead Cool, released on Crypt Records, though some of the drum tracks on that album & the tracks on ‚ÄúVice Squad Dick‚Äù were handled by former lead guitarist singer & songwriter for seminal New Orleans punk band ‚ÄúThe Normals‚Äù, founder & songwriter for Mercury/Polygram artists ‚ÄúThe Vels‚Äù, & bassist for Amphetamine Reptile artist ‚ÄúLoudspeaker‚Äù, Charles Hanson, as earlier drummer. After releasing Vice Squad Dick‚Äîa PCP Entertainment EP shared with J. G. Thirlwell‚ÄîThe Chrome Cranks eponymous first album made its debut in November 1994 and was warmly received by the underground music press. Jerry Teel remodeled The Chrome Cranks' modest rehearsal space into a fully functioning recording facility‚ÄîFunhouse Studio‚Äîwhere most of their subsequent recordings were made and they recorded other acts as well. In 1996, The Chrome Cranks once again toured Europe on the strength of an EP, Lost Time Blues, again issued by PCP Entertainment. The next studio album, Love in Exile, featured the song \\"Hot Blonde Cocktail\\" which went into rotation on MTV and occasioned another six-week round of touring in Europe, during which Live in Exile (Konkurrent) was recorded during a date in the Netherlands. Atavistic Records subsequently issued a package of early demos as Oily Cranks, and The Chrome Cranks did a Canadian/North American tour in support to Geraldine Fibbers. But by this time The Chrome Cranks were getting worn out with the constant pressure of touring, and after a final European tour in 1998 the group went on an indefinite hiatus. All of the groups' members went into other projects, save Aaron, who went into music journalism; he currently edits a magazine, Chronogram. Teel ultimately moved to New Orleans, and though his home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, has since settled there permanently. After two tours with the Candy Snatchers, Weber returned to Cincinnati where he established his own recording facility, Krakdhaus Studio, and played with local groups while still appearing, on occasion, with the now GG Allin-less Murder Junkies. Aaron participated in a studio project, Avondale Airforce, with Venture Lift's Stanton Warren. The Chrome Cranks enjoyed a revival of interest when, in 2007, Atavistic Records released Diabolical Boogie, a compilation prepared from rare, live and unreleased material. After a series of well-received reunion gigs in New York City in May 2009, the group played the Nuits Sonore festival in Lyon, France. The success of further New York engagements convinced the band to make a new studio album, Ain't No Lies in Blood, which was released on Thick Syrup Records (CD) and Bang! Records in Spain in 2012. Reviews were exceedingly positive, with some writers proclaiming Ain't No Lies in Blood a better effort than any of The Chrome Cranks' 1990s recordings. In early 2013 Bang! also released Moon in the Mountain, a long EP which combined new material with a session recorded in the UK in 1995. This has led to a new European tour for the formerly \\"defunct\\" band that will take place in August and September 2013. Style & Forward Influence The Chrome Cranks are renowned for their raw, dark, and fiery live performances, and they were regarded as one of the leading acts in the 1990s punk blues movement in New York City. The Chrome Cranks‚Äô singular brand of dark, unhinged punk blues has been cited as a key influence by a growing number of younger acts, such as The White Stripes and Cat Power. Covers of songs by The Chrome Cranks as done by other bands are relatively commonplace, and several are being assembled into a tribute album tentatively entitled Collision Blues.

Directed by Satish Kaushik, it is a remake of Bengali film Bhooter Bhabishyat (Future of The Past). Plot A story about a group of ghosts who have lost their shelter due to urbanization. The story that the stranger narrates shows the communal, social, linguistic and historical differences among the ghosts, as they belong to different eras. It starts with a struggling wannabe film director entering the Royal Mansion in the motive of shooting for a movie of title \\"Hot Haryanvi\\" for which he can't decide about the ending. There a stranger comes past the guard to meet the director claiming that he is a writer and has a wonderful story worth making a movie. But, the director brushes him off. The writer Raju (Sharman Joshi) again confronts the director in order to make him listen to his story. The director (Parambrata Chatterjee) finally agrees but on a condition that the writer will have to listen to his story first. Raju writer listens to his story but doesn't like it and tells him to throw his story into a dustbin. The director then listens to Raju writer's story. He starts his story by saying about the relation of Mumbai's social and industrial works with the spirits or ghosts staying in the houses, trees, etc., and how their homes are lost. Then he shifts to Raibahadur Seth Gendamal Hemraj (Anupam Kher) who owns a large Mill and is also the owner of the Royal Mansion. The mill workers angry by Gendamal's friendly relation with the Britishers, set out to burn the mill in which Gendamal was present, burning him to death. His ghost now stays at his own Royal Mansion. Then Raju tells about Mr.Ramsey (J.Brandon Hill) who was had a habit of reading and at that time the Indians were struggling for the fight for Independence and threw a bomb at him to his death. He contacted his once upon a time boss Mr. Booth who asks Gendamal to let Ramsey stay at the Royal Mansion to which Gendamal agrees. Raju then tells the director that Gendamal had a younger brother Gulab Chand (Chunkey Pandey) who was dating a famous actress at that time Manoranjana Kumari (Mahi Gill). She wanted Gulab to marry her and he also agrees with to soon marry each other. But Gulab betrays her by marrying a rich girl. So she gets depresses and drinks a lot due to which she falls to her death from her balcony. Gendamal allows her to stay at the Royal Mansion. Gulab also dies after being shot by gangsters but Gendamal denies his request to stay at the mansion. Soon Gendamal and Ramsey conduct an audition for eligible ghosts in search of shelter. They select only 10 to 15 ghosts as the Mansion would be overcrowded. All live happily in the Royal Mansion with each other with some ghosts flirting with Manoranjana and others doing their own works. Until one day, they come to know that a businessman named Mr. Bhuteria (Rajesh Khattar) is planning to demolish the Mansion to build a grand mall in its place. The ghosts plan together to not let him achieve his goal. Manoranjana goes to Bhuteria by another name to pull out some information from Bhuteria where he tells her of his wife Lakshmi (Pretie Lad) who died and still haunts him in his dreams. He then reveals to Manoranjana that he actually killed her. Bhuteria turns to find Manoranjana is not there. A ghost named Babu Hatkata (Jackie Shroff) goes to Bhuteria to tell him that he knows of his plots and invites him to the Royal Mansion to speak with Gendamal. There he enjoys a party organised by the ghosts and comes to know that one of the dancers is his Lakshmi and they reveal that they are all ghosts and Gendamal also tells him that if he makes a mall then they will be homeless and tells him to get out of the mansion. Bhuteria returns to the mansion and returns the original documents of the mansion and never comes back again. The story ends here where in the present, the director wonders if he has the resources and finance to make the movie. Raju goes back to the store room and comes back with a pouch of gold coins from the time of the East India Company and their value would be enough to make the film. There Raju tells the director that while being he couldn't do anything but after dying he was able to get acknowledgement, which explains that the director was talking to a ghost all the time. He explain that while he was in his struggling days he once came across a bus where some men are about to rape a girl. He rushes to save her during which he gets stabbed to his death. He brushes it off until Raju shows him all the ghosts in another room. He wakes up from a dream stating that this was a dream. He meets his crew searching for him and tells that he listened a full script in his dream. He goes back to the room to find Raju's bag which is full of cash and also the pouch of gold coins earlier in his pocket and gets spooked. Inspired by the story, he starts the movie with Raju's story with all the ghosts looking at the shoot with great happiness.

Males of this species grow to a length of SL while females only reach SL. This species is the only known member of its genus. The name Crystallogobius comes from the Latin words cristallum, meaning \\"crystal\\", and gobius, meaning gudgeon.  Distribution  Crystal gobies can be found in the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Europe from Norway down to Spain, and even off the mainland on Madeira, Portugal. Additionally, they can be found throughout the Mediterranean off the coast of Europe from Spain to Turkey.Kovacic, M. W. (2014). Crystallogobius linearis (Cristal Goby, Crystal Goby).

(2001). Age and growth of Crystallogobius linearis (von D√ºben, 1845) (Teleostei: Gobiidae) from the Adriatic Sea. Scientia Marina, 375-381.  Description  The Crystal goby gets its name from the glassy, see-through appearance of its body. It was first described by D√ºben and Koren in 1846. Crystal goby males' first dorsal fins are reduced and they exhibit large caniniform teeth. On the other hand, females do not have dorsal fins. Neither males nor females have scales. Crystal gobies have swimbladders and their alimentary canals are rather short and straight. There is sexual dimorphism in this species due to males growing up to 4.7 cm (1.9 in) and females growing up to 3.9 cm (1.5 in).Froese, R. &. (n.d.). Crystallogobius linearis (D√ºben, 1845) . Retrieved from World Register of Marine Species: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=126878#sources They only live about 1 year as they die after breeding. Additionally, they have 2-3 dorsal spines, 18-20 dorsal soft rays, 1 anal spine, and 20-21 anal soft rays.Wheeler, A. (1992). A list of the common and scientific names of fishes of the British Isles. Fish Biology, 1-37.  Fishing  There is not much data suggesting that this species is fished very much, which most likely has to do with its relatively small size compared to other fished species. However, there is data that shows they were fished in the Ligurian Sea by artisanal fishers using beach-seines from Camogli and Sestri Levante in Italy. Additionally, there is evidence of Crystal gobies being sold in Barcelona, Spain.Kovacic, M. W. (2014). Crystallogobius linearis (Cristal Goby, Crystal Goby). Retrieved from The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species: https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2014-3.RLTS.T198654A45102461.en Although they are caught and sold, they seem to be by-catch and therefore not targeted by the fishing industry.  Reproduction  Crystal gobies are an \\"annual\\" species which means that they die after reproducing. The eggs are demersal and can be found in the tubes of polychaetes and serpulids. It has been suggested that spawning occurs between May and September, with the Northeastern Atlantic Crystal gobies spawning before the Mediterranean ones. Crystal gobies are unique because the females can be sexually mature at only 4 months, which is relatively fast for gobies. They are able to reproduce at small body sizes with some larval anatomical features still present. The fact that this species reproduces so young and with some larval features may explain their anatomy.

Lyrically, Sparks plays with music metaphors throughout, comparing switching up the tune on a song to falling in love. the song is a confession on Sparks' behalf admitting a special love for admittedly her boyfriend Jason Derulo and her strong feelings towards him which causes her heart to start skipping beats, while hoping for more in the future. The first verse introduces the concept of the song: \\" You make my heart skip like we're playing hopscotch/Hope I'm the one that you wanna put the rock on/Hey, hey, you make it stutter/Hey, hey, think I love ya/Boy I think I'm gonna need an ambulance/Cause you been doing my heart some damage/But I like it, oh you're so exciting. Critical reception Following its release, \\"Skipping a Beat\\" was well received by most music critics. Mike Wass of Idolator called the track \\"an infectious mid-tempo pop song with urban roots\\" comparing it to Ariana Grande's hit single The Way \\"with an edge\\", and added that the track \\"seems to be an ode to her man. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my lover, you‚Äôre my friend, you‚Äôre my gangsta,‚Äù she purrs over tinny synths and piano. It takes a couple of listens but the multitude of hooks pull you in and before you‚Äôre singing along. Always the sign of a great pop song\\". John Geraghty of Billboard wrote \\" With its breezy R&B; vibe, the mid-tempo song is essentially the polar opposite\\" of Sparks' 2011 single \\"I Am Woman\\" which was originally planned to lead her third album. Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy called it a \\"vaguely old-school '90s R&B; track\\" and called Sparks' \\"Battlefield\\" one of their favorite songs of 2009 & 2010 \\"so anything post-\\"Battefield\\" is gonna have to work very hard to win our approval... While we totally appreciate the ultra- romantic lyrics and that catchy \\"humming\\" hook, we're not entirely convinced that this is Jordin's most progressive offering to date.

He is known for his energetic and entertaining live performances. History =Early years= Ruhumuriza was born in 1990 in CHK (Centre Hospitalier de Kigali), Kigali city, Rwanda, the sixth of seven children in a Seventh-day Adventist family. He completed his secondary studies at the French-language Ecole APE Rugunga, and as of 2013 is enrolled at Mount Kenya University where he got a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication. As a child he aspired to become a professional football player. He was later exposed to the songs of American R&B; artist Brandy and became inspired to begin composing and performing music. =Musical career= The musical career of King James was launched in 2006 with the release of a single that met with little success. He opened shows for more popular artists for the next several years. The mid-2009 release of his single \\"Intinyi\\" attracted critical acclaim and launched his solo career. By the end of 2010, King James had firmly established his popularity as a leading R&B; artist, competing for market dominance against Rwandan artists Tom Close, Meddy and The Ben. The departure of Meddy and The Ben to the United States provided King James with greater exposure and his popularity grew further. He signed to the label Kina Music and released his debut album, Umugisha, in 2011, followed in 2012 by a second album entitled Umuvandimwe. After a temporary lag in popularity in late 2011, the artist enjoyed a resurgence of fame following the release of two widely successful singles, \\"Ndakwizera\\" and \\"Buhoro Buhoro\\". Currently, his singles \\"Yantumye\\", \\"Ndagukunda\\", \\"Naramukundaga\\" are the most successful songs in the country. In August 2016, he released his new single \\"The girl is mine \\" with the vincentian soca artist Kevin Lyttle which is among the most trending hits in the region. Awards King James was voted Artist of the Year in the 2011 Salax Awards, having previously won the award in the category of Best R&B; Artist. In 2012, he won first place in the Primus Guma Guma Super Star annual talent competition. King James from 2013 is one of the Rwandan acts to perform at the Rwanda Day held in London, Netherlands, Atlanta and the latest was in San Francisco last September 2016. In addition to touring widely in Rwanda and the countries of the East African Community, he has performed in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium. Personal life and relationships His personal life has been a subject of media attention. Although a perfectionist in the recording studio, in social settings he is known as a simple, unpretentious and friendly person who is well liked within the industry and in the media. He refuses to drink or smoke and enjoys reading books on a variety of topics. Other activities In 2013 he established the King James Foundation, which aims to improve quality of life for the most vulnerable in Rwandan society. He has declared an interest in providing financial support and recording studio access to fledgling Rwandan artists. He is one of the best Rwandan artists who performed in different political events across the world.

It was released through Adipocere Records in May 1996. The album features cover artwork created by Kristian \\"Necrolord\\" W√•hlin. The album's style has been compared to contemporaries such as Dissection and Unanimated, and the album is frequently considered an often-overlooked classic in the genre.  Background  Following the release of their demo EP Finis Malorum (later reissued on Adipocere Records, to whom the band had signed in 1994), bassist Freddy Andersson and drummer Mikael Ryd√©n left the band, \\"unwilling to go on after Brolycke and Karl√©n had decided to move to Gothenburg.\\" Following this, Karl√©n switched to bass to allow himself to focus more on vocals. After moving to Gothenburg they got in touch with Johan Norman (Decameron, Satanized). Sacramentum asked him to join the band, and Norman offered to bring Nicklas \\"Terror\\" Rudolfsson with him. \\"Ironically, Norman stayed in the band less than six months, before quitting to join Dissection. However, \\"Terror\\" did stick around and proved to be \\"a perfect match\\".\\" Thus the lineup that recorded the album was Brolycke, Karl√©n, and Rudolfsson.Far Away from the Sun. Century Media Records (CD liner). Sacramentum. 2014. 9982442  Musical style, writing, composition  The album's style has been frequently compared to fellow Swedish black metal band Dissection. However, Chronicles of Chaos wrote that \\"Their style is less aggressive than Dissection, but more intricate\\" and \\"their melodic parts are usually either harmonized or have countermelodies\\". According to Rudolfsson, \\"When I entered the picture, most of the album was already written and ready to be rehearsed, but I still helped with some riffs, lyrics and arrangements.\\" It has also been described as \\"cold, raw and epic\\", and \\"For most of the record tremolo guitars, blast beats and an oversaturated vocal dominate. There is a touch of Gothic Metal that a lot of the mid nineties black metal releases incorporated.\\"  Artwork  The artwork was created by Kristian \\"Necrolord\\" W√•hlin, a friend of the band at the time and who lived in the same city. Karl√©n later purchased the original painting from W√•hlin, and is therefore one of only three he has ever agreed to sell, along with Tiamat's albums \\"Wildhoney\\" and \\"Clouds\\". According to guitarist Anders Brolycke, > \\"Nisse had this vision about this special place out there for him, as he > felt he didn't belong to this world and Kristian perfectly reproduced it for > him.\\" This will explain then, why, when you look closely, you realise there > are no lights emanating from this ominous looking castle, hidden in some > god-forsaken land. \\"No, and this was intentional as light means life. And > there's no life to be found here.\\"  Release, promotion, marketing  The album was released in May 1996, almost a year after the album had been recorded. \\"For Anders, apart from a lack of promotion and decent distribution, this is one of the main reasons why they've not been positioned as one of the top pioneers in the Swedish scene: > \\"It's all about timing in the music business as to if you will succeed or > not. The basic rule is the earlier the better and people count the release > date rather than when the songs were made. This is why it was so unfortunate > that it took so long to get the album out. Maybe everything would have been > different if it was released one year earlier. But it's one of those 'what > if' questions we'll never have the answers to.\\" The album was reissued by Century Media Records in 2013. For this reissue, the album was remastered by Dan Swan√∂ in November 2012, with a new CD and booklet layout by Nora Dorkling, rescanned high quality album artwork by Necrolord, as well as an in-depth interview with band by Olivier 'Zoltar' Badin. A music video for \\"Fog's Kiss\\" was created to promote the album but was never used until the band provided Century Media with it to promote the reissue.  Critical reception  The album has received positive reviews from music critics, and is widely considered an often-overlooked classic in the genre. Chronicles of Chaos wrote that \\"On their first full-length offering, Sacramentum fix most of the mistakes they made on Finis Malorum. They praised the \\"intricacy\\" of the album, as well as the variety, noting that \\"the songs on this offering vary often, switching riffs every couple of times that they're played. In some cases, this amounts to nothing more than a change of key or a different drum beat, but it does help to keep the album from getting boring too quickly. Overall, I was a little disappointed by this album, but I did have high hopes for it, and it nearly delivered. I'd recommended it for Dissection and melodic black metal fans.\\" Writing for SputnikMusic, Adam Thomas praised the album, and lamented that the band is frequently overlooked. Thomas particularly praised Niklas Rudolfsson's drumming, writing that \\"his breakneck drumming is the focal point of all the songs from the get go. His frenetic yet inventive style melds perfectly into the spiderweb-like arrangements.\\" He also added that \\"The speed and precision of the guitarists along with their knack for harmonic structures conveys more than the desolate mood that is reflected by most bands of the era, it creates the forceful state of anger and discourse that makes Far Away From the Sun unique\\", calling it \\"a shining example of the genre\\". Metal Crypt wrote that \\"this album in particular has an unexplainable aura about it, not dissimilar to the aura of either of the classic Dissection albums, intangible and inexplicable, but most certainly there. Almost as if some vast dark presence was present during the album recording sessions (no; not Barry White) and captured forevermore in sonic form. This, when coupled with some truly incredible music played by talented musicians, gives them the edge over the multitude of lifeless pastiches wanting nothing more but to be the next big thing.\\" Metal Temple wrote that ‚ÄúFog‚Äôs Kiss‚Äù is \\"one of the reasons ‚ÄúFar Away From The Sun‚Äù is looked upon as a legendary release, truly monumental.\\"  Legacy  Metal Injection named them as one of the most important bands in 'blackened melodic death metal' history, writing that - along with Dawn, Unanimated, and Vinterland - \\"these bands embody all the best things about metal: catchy riffs and great songwriting, effective use of melody to create a narrative structure, vocals soaked in reverb, and all the brutality one needs without resorting to cheesiness or self-parody.\\" When the album was reissued in 2012, Steffen Kummerer of Obscura named it his fourth favourite album of the year.

It was named by the surveyor, Alfred Hulse Brooks, in 1900. Geography Cape Mountain on Cape Prince of Wales is the northern terminus point of the Continental Divide of the Americas. At one time, it was considered to be the most western point of the United States. The mountain's elevation is , with a sharp peak above the York Plateau, and a well-marked bench formation at ; the east base has an elevation below . There is a sharp pinnacle at its western edge. Tin City developed on the southeastern side, while Kingegan is situated to the northwest; Teller is to the southeast. Cape Creek has its headwaters on the mountain's eastern side and flows southward for approximately until it reaches the Bering Sea at Tin City. The west fork's headwaters are in the mountain's uplands while the east fork's headwaters flow against the continental divide; a tributary, First Chance Creek, enters near Cape Creek's mouth. Geology Granites and fine grained porphyries are the geological formations recorded in the mountain, which are very much jointed. From the geological map of the mountain it is noted that granite formations are massive and crystalline which has generated distinctive topographic features. The crest and the pinnacles are of granite rock with double system of jointing. Feldspar crystals are seen at the margin of these massive formations. The granites are coarse crystalline normally porphyritic, and basically with geological formations of quartz, microcline and biotite. Local glaciation has been recorded on the mountain. There is also a belt of limestone inferred as belonging to the Kigluaik series. White limestone formations are inferred as intrusives and its formations on the western side of the mountain dip away from granite. While driving a long adit from an elevation of into the Cape Mountain, close to the peak, for prospecting for minerals, biotite granite formation of the hill revealed cassiterite-bearing quartz of the Late Cretaceous period. The evolution of the Cape Mountain granite has been \\"determined to be 78.8 +/- 2.9 my old by the K/Ar method\\". Mineral prospecting Tin lodes have been prospected in the mountain. Tin ore was discovered in July 1902 by W.C.J.Bartels, but attempts to explore the mountains proved unsuccessful as the engine set up at the beach, near what is now Tin City, was defective. The mountain has placer concentrates of radioactive minerals of monazite, xenotine, and zircon. The concentrates have 0.9 percent equivalent uranium (averaging about 0.03 percent equivalent uranium) attributed to thorium in the monazite content. It is inferred that the radioactive minerals found could be due to the granite formations of the mountain or to the tin deposits found in the region.

It was created after World War II by the government in order to control raisin prices. The reserve was run by the Raisin Administrative Committee. It was enforced by means of a \\"marketing order\\". In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled the reserve unconstitutional and ended it. History The reserve was founded in 1949 as a means to prevent the crash of raisin prices in post- World War II America. Because there was less demand from the federal government for raisins, there was suddenly a glut of raisins on the market. As a result, prices began to go down. In 1949, Marketing Order 989 was passed which created the reserve and the Raisin Administrative Committee, which was responsible for running the reserve. Once established, the reserve functioned as a government-mandated cartel, artificially limiting the raisin supply in order to drive up prices, for the collective benefit of raisin growers. American raisins, once seized, were sent to various warehouses across California, to be stored until sold to foreign nations, fed to cattle or schoolchildren, or disposed of in any other way to get them off the market that year. The Raisin Administrative Committee was based in Fresno, California, and was overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture. The committee was made up of industry representatives, who would decide each year on the size of the reserve and what to do with the stockpiled supply. The profits from the sale of the reserved raisins (taken from growers often for no payment) were used to pay the expenses of the committee or pay farmers for their seized produce. In one recent year, $65,483,211 was seized; it was all spent, with nothing left over for farmers. Regarding the National Raisin Reserve, Daniel Sumner, director of the University of California‚Äôs Agricultural Issues Center stated \\"It‚Äôs a cartel. Let‚Äôs use the power of the government to operate a cartel...\\", \\"Congress had given the USDA the authority to operate reserves during the New Deal: Other reserves existed for almonds, walnuts, tart cherries and other products.\\" In 2013, Florida Congressman Trey Radel introduced a bill that would repeal Marketing Order 989. The bill was introduced but not enacted., Died in a previous Congress. This bill was introduced on July 25, 2013, in a previous session of Congress, but was not enacted. Supreme Court case The reserve gained prominence in 2013 when Marvin Horne challenged the legitimacy of the reserve in Horne v. Department of Agriculture. Horne's takings claim made its way all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which reversed and remanded the determination of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that it had no jurisdiction. On remand, the Ninth Circuit found that the reserve's requirements did not constitute a taking. In April 2015, the case was argued again before the Supreme Court, which decided in June 2015, by a majority of 5-4,https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-275 that the confiscation of a portion of a farmer's crops without market price compensation was unconstitutional. The Court found no reason to remand the case, stating \\"[t]his case, in litigation for more than a decade, has gone on long enough.\\" Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 135 S. Ct. 2419 (2015) This ended the raisin reserve. Other reserves In addition to the National Raisin Reserve, during the New Deal other reserves existed for almonds, walnuts, tart cherries and other products. Enacted during the Great Depression, the New Deal reserves were a result of the government's attempt to keep prices viable for farmers to grow the fruit and make a suitable profit. Most of these no longer exist.

Linda Blair, who previously starred in The Exorcist, starred in the film and was the associate producer. It was filmed at Big Bear Lake. Plot A clearly disturbed woman offers herself to a deformed man in a cloak saying that he may kill her or have sex with her as long as he is quick. The man bites into her neck killing her. It is then shown that this scene was part of a screening of an upcoming film with the special effects being created by Orville Kruger (Guy Stockwell). Orville states to the producer of the film that he is going to his home in the San Bernardino Mountains after finishing this most recent project. Orville's daughter Lisa (Linda Blair) invites her friend Kathy (Donna Wilkes) to her parents home for the weekend so she can get over a recent breakup. On the way to the cabin, Lisa and Kathy are harassed by a gang of punks driving a Volkswagen van. The gangs van breaks down and their leader Scratch demands that the van be fixed quickly. They are planning a home invasion robbery of Orville Kruger since they have heard rumors of something being kept hidden in the house which they assume to be valuables. Scratch also states that they shouldn't have a repeat of a previous robbery in Nevada where the gang slaughtered an entire family. Lisa and Kathy arrive at the house and are greeted by Lisa's mother who states that Lisa's uncle Rod (Tab Hunter) who is a plastic surgeon will be arriving the next day. After settling in, Lisa asks her mother how 'Patrick' is doing to which her mother states that he has his good days and bad days. While Lisa takes a shower, Kathy rests in the bedroom and a sea creature bursts into the room causing her to scream. It is then revealed that the sea creature is Orville in disguise and he has a habit of playing practical jokes using his special effects. Later that evening, during dinner Kathy shows interest in Orville's effects work and is shown to his study where several masks and props are on display. Orville states that he wonders if Kathy could really tell the difference between reality and illusion. While preparing for bed Lisa's mother says to Orville that she fed 'Patrick' and that it went well. After going to bed, Lisa and Kathy are awoken by the gang dragging them out of bed and down stairs where they are also holding Orville and Lisa's mother hostage. They terrorize the family with threats of rape, torture, and murder if they do not show them where the hidden valuables are. Orville states that there are no valuables and in frustration they beat him to death with a log. Scratch then tells two other gang members to take Lisa's mother and have her show them where the valuables are. A set of eyes are shown watching the gang torment the family through a glass covered slot in the wall. While continuing to taunt Lisa and Kathy, the girls are able to get away briefly. Kathy comes across Lisa's mother who is dead by having her throat slit. Kathy is about to be raped when a female gang member stabs her to death instead. Lisa is caught and taken back to the living room and informed that her mother and friend are both dead and that she should tell them where the valuables are but she insists that there are none. In an act of desperation, Lisa jumps through a second story window and runs into the snow covered wilderness with a gang member in close pursuit. The rest of the gang decide to split up and ransack the house to find the valuables themselves and come across a hidden room decorated like a nursery. A hideously deformed man who had been locked in the room kills two gang members by crushing one in a bear hug and another by snapping her neck. The deformed man then cries at the body of Orville while sobbing, \\"Papa\\". The rest of the gang arrive and flee at the sight of the deformed man by running into the woods. The gang decides to split up into two groups of two so that there is less of a chance of them being caught by the deformed man. Two of the gang make their way to a mine shaft and build a fire to stay warm but are soon discovered by the deformed man who kills both with his bare hands. Scratch and his accomplice Shelley decide that they should fight the deformed man while trying to escape without the rest of the gang. Meanwhile, sunrise has come and Lisa is still being pursued through the wilderness by a gang member who is able to ambush her and strangle her. The deformed man arrives and kills the gang member but Lisa is unresponsive. A friend of the family arrives at the house, discovers the bodies and alerts the authorities. The police arrive and shortly after so does uncle Rod. The police question whether there were any enemies of Orville and if Lisa is a likely suspect. Acting under the assumption that whoever committed the murders couldn't have gone far since the van is still at the bottom of the hill and would most likely attempt to escape into the woods, the police form a posse to track down the perpetrators. The posse splits up to cover more ground and Lisa is discovered barely alive but unconscious. Meanwhile, the deformed man has come across Scratch and Shelley and attempts to kill them but is shot several times by Scratch. He is thought dead but when they move closer to inspect him, he attacks again. The posse arrives and seeing the deformed man attacking two people are about to shoot when Rod yells for them not to. They shoot the deformed man in the head and the two gang members are taken into custody. Lisa is taken to the hospital and has a blood clot which they hope to remove but her chances are roughly 50/50 of surviving. Scratch and Shelley maintain a story that their vans radiator needed water and they went to the house looking for help when the deformed man appeared and began killing everyone. The police don't believe Scratch and Shelley since the van has an air cooled engine and wouldn't need water but can't prove that they are guilty of the murders. Lisa dies during the surgery and as the only witness to the home invasion, Scratch and Shelley are scheduled to be released. Rod explains to the police that the deformed man was an abandoned child named Patrick the Krugers took in and raised and would never do anything to hurt anyone. Rod is upset that the police can't act because of lack of evidence so he rents two surgical tables and procures a shotgun from an associate. When Scratch and Shelley are released and are waiting to be picked up by a friend, Rod forces them into his car by shotgun and makes them drive to the Krugers home. He forces them inside and into the hidden room where the two surgical tables are set up. He ties them down and explains that Patrick was his son who was born with physical deformities and mental deficiencies. Rod then reveals that he too has facial deformities and that his brother Orville used his special effects skills to make a mask that would allow him to live in society. Rod says that he is beautiful by comparison since they are truly ugly and that the room is sound proof so no one will ever hear them. Rod is then shown without his mask, sitting in a chair in the Krugers home, enjoying a drink while Scratch and Shelley having been surgically deformed, silently scream through the glass covered slot of the sound proof room. The events of the story are shown to once again be a preview screening of an upcoming movie with the cast watching in attendance. The film being shown ends abruptly and in the projectionists booth Frankenstein and the Wolfman discuss the film. The Wolfman having smashed the projector since it didn't accurately depict monsters while Frankenstein states that the film is perhaps an 8 out of 10. They both agree to show everyone what real monsters are like and burst into the screening room causing everyone to scream and flee in terror. The film ends with Frankenstein and the Wolfman stating that they are still the best.

Stien Reception Joe Corey, of Inside Pulse, wrote, \\"The movie gets weird with a rather arty finale about cinema and reality. This isn‚Äôt so much Grotesque as Perplexed\\". Stuart Galbraith IV, writing for DVD Talk, said that \\"the picture is a time-wasting jumble of half-baked ideas, overcooked performances (the actors playing punks are ridiculously overwrought throughout), and herky-jerky pacing\\". Paul Pritchard, of DVD Verdict, wrote that \\"Grotesque makes yet another shift as it becomes an early entry into the torture porn genre, before ending in total farce, as it makes one final genre shift into comedy\\". A review in VideoHound's Cult Flicks & Trash Pics said that the film is \\"played too straight to be funny and too badly to be shocking\\". Home media Grotesque was released in a DVD set with three other low-budget films - Lady Frankenstein, The Velvet Vampire, and Time Walker. While the other films in the set have special features, this film does not. It is the only film in the set that is full frame, which a reviewer for DVD Talk said that it \\"appears to be an ancient video transfer, one that might even pre-date the dawn of DVD\\".

Government and civil society initiatives to realise and uphold the rights of children has resulted in progress in the field of education and primary healthcare for children. However, key challenges remain, particularly for marginalized and disadvantaged groups of children in the country. The Government of Malaysia‚Äôs reservations to five Articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Articles 2, 7, 14, 28(a)(1) and 37) suggest that it takes the view that children can be discriminated against, have no right to a name or nationality, have no freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and should not be free from torture and deprivation of liberty. Convention on the Rights of the Child In 1995, the Government of Malaysia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), an international human rights treaty which upholds the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of all children below 18 years. Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, the CRC is based on four core principles, namely the principle of non discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to life, survival and development, and considering the views of the child in decisions which affect them (according to their age and maturity). =CRC Optional Protocols= The Government of Malaysia ratified the CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2012. Malaysia has not acceded to the CRC‚Äôs third Optional Protocol, adopted by the United Nations in 2011, relating to communication of complaints. =CRC Reservations= The Government of Malaysia‚Äôs ratification of the CRC contains a number of conditions in the form of ‚Äòreservations‚Äô, which allow the Government to disagree with a provision in the CRC. Malaysia has five reservations currently, namely to: * Article 2 on non-discrimination * Article 7 on name and nationality * Article 14 on freedom of thought, conscience and religion * Article 28(1)(a) on free and compulsory education at primary level * Article 37 on torture and deprivation of liberty The Government expressed these reservations on the grounds that the CRC Articles were said to \\"not conform with the Constitution, national laws and national policies of the Government of Malaysia, including the Syariah law.\\" In 2010, the Government of Malaysia withdrew three earlier reservations to the CRC, namely Article 1 (definition of the child), Article 13 (freedom of expression) and Article 15 (freedom of assembly and participation). =CRC Reporting= National governments that ratify the CRC and its Optional Protocols must report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the body of experts charged with monitoring a country's implementation of these human rights treaties. These government reports must outline the situation of children in the country and explain the measures taken to realise and protect their rights. The First Report from the Government of Malaysia to the Committee on the Rights of the Child was submitted in 2006, which was nine years overdue. The second report was due by 19 March 2012. =CRC Committee Concluding Observations= In 2007, the Committee on the Rights of the Child submitted its Concluding Observations to the Government of Malaysia following the country's submission of its first CRC report. The Concluding Observations included the following recommendations: * Review and abolish Malaysia's reservations to the CRC * Review Malaysia's dual legal system (Civil and Syariah) as some domestic laws are obstacles to the realisation of the CRC in Malaysia * Establish a systematic assessment of the impact of budgetary allocations on the implementation of the rights of the child * Improve the birth registration system of non-Malaysian children born in Malaysia, children of single mothers and children born in remote areas of the country. * Ensure that all children have equal access to quality education at all levels and that their access to education is not impeded by economic shortcomings; * Collect adequate statistical data on children with disabilities and ensure the use of such data in the development of policies and programmes for these children; * Abolish capital punishment for children * Review the Children and Young Persons (Employment) Act 1966 to ensure that acceptable conditions of work are clearly and strictly defined to comply with international labour standards. Legal Framework Malaysia has a legislative, administrative and policy framework to cater for the protection and needs of children and the promotion of their physical, mental, intellectual and emotional development. The Federal Constitution sets out the basic human rights standards, which also extend to children. These include liberty of the person (Article 5); prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 6); and rights in respect of education (Article 12). Malaysia enacted the Child Act 2001 [Act 611] to fulfil its obligation under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). =Child Act 2001= The Child Act 2001 (Act 611) is the country's legislation for the protection, care and rehabilitation of children. This Act incorporates the core principles of non-discrimination, best interests of the child, the right to life, survival and development as well as respect for the views of the child. Act 611 repealed the Juvenile Courts Act 1947 [Act 90], the Women and Girls Protection Act 1973 [Act 106] and the Child Protection Act 1991 [Act 468]. In 2001, the Act established the National Council for the Protection of Children, which advises the Government on child protection issues while the National Advisory and Consultative Council for Children acts as a national focal point for children's wellbeing and development. Act 611 also requires the setting up of Child Protection Teams and Child Activity Centres at both state and district levels for children at risk or children vulnerable to all forms of abuse and exploitation. In terms of administration of juvenile justice, Act 611 provides for a procedure before the Court for Children, which is child-friendly taking into account the mental and emotional maturity of a child. =Other laws= Other child-related legislation in Malaysia include the Adoption Act 1952, Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 2007, Child Care Centres Act 1984, Children and Young Persons (Employment) Act 1966; Domestic Violence Act 1994, Education Act 1996 and the Islamic Family Law (Federal Territory) Act 1984 (‚ÄúIFLA‚Äù) [Act 303]. Progress The principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child have helped influence Malaysia's efforts to reduce the number of children dying before the age of five, accelerate girls‚Äô education, and increase access to education for children living in remote parts of the country. Primary school education was made compulsory in 2002 to ensure increased school enrolment and completion. The Child Act 2001 (Act 611) has introduced several initiatives to safeguard children from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. Incest has been criminalised by the Penal Code (Act 574), while the Domestic Violence Act 1994 (Act 521) protects the child against violence within the family. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act came into force on 28 February 2008 and provides, among others, the legal mechanism to criminalise human trafficking and providing care, protection and shelter for the victims. At the international level, Malaysia has signed the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) in 2002 and ratified it in 2004. Malaysia is currently in the process of acceding to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children, supplementing UNTOC. Issues of Concern Despite lifting the reservation to Article 1, inconsistencies in the definition of the child under national laws remain, with multiple, contradictory definitions of the child under both civil and Sharia law. There has yet to be a shift from needs-based to rights-based policies and programs for children in Malaysia. Approaches towards children are generally paternalistic and their views are generally not sought or given due weight in decisions that affect them. =Undocumented Children= Although birth registration is a fundamental right of every child, it is estimated that there are 50,000 undocumented children in Malaysia. They include children from the rural poor and indigenous communities in remote locations, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak as well as children of irregular migrants and refugees. Malaysia does not grant citizenship by birth, choosing not to adhere to the principle of jus soli. Individuals can only apply for citizenship if one parent is a citizen of Malaysia. Migrants must produce each parent's passport and a certificate of marriage, documents which many do not possess, if they wish to obtain a birth certificate in Malaysia. In addition, those who work in rural areas are sometimes not able to travel to the national registration authority to apply for the birth certificate. The fear of arrest and detention, and the restrictions on the ability of some migrant workers to marry, has meant that many refugees, asylum-seeking and irregular migrants do not apply for birth certificates for their children. Children without a birth certificate can be denied access to healthcare and other basic social services which expose them to exploitation and poor health. They are unable to enroll in Government schools or to participate in examinations. For Malaysian children, a lack of a birth certificate can also affect their chances of applying for a MyKad when they reach 12 years of age. =Out-of-School Children= Although the Education Amendment Act 2002 has made primary education compulsory for all children from aged 6, this requirement is not enforced. There are an estimated 200,000 children of primary-school age in Malaysia who are not attending school. Cost of schooling is one of the obstacles for children from low-income families. Education is also not sufficient for children with disabilities; children (of Malaysians) without birth certificates are denied the opportunity to attend schools; and asylum seeking children, refugee children, stateless children as well as children of migrant workers are not given free primary education in government-run schools. =Child Marriage= Malaysia's Population and Housing Census in 2010 showed that 82,282 married women in Malaysia were girls between the ages of 15 and 19, while another 1,000 in this age group were widowed and 842 separated or divorced. The Deputy Minister for Women revealed that, for that same year, nearly 16,000 girls below the age of 15 were in a marriage. Malaysia has a dual legal system, which means that the minimum age of marriage can be determined by either civil law or Syaria (Islamic) law. Non-Muslims may only marry from the age of 18, but girls can be married as early as 16 provided they or their parents have the permission of the State Chief Minister. The minimum age of marriage is 16 for Muslim girls and 18 for Muslim boys. Crucially, exceptions can be made for girls or boys to marry at a much younger age as long as they obtain Islamic courts‚Äô consent. Factors that lead to early marriage in Malaysia are pregnancies before marriage and parents‚Äô decision to avoid their children's involvement in deteriorating moral problems.
