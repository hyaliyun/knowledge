Her work is largely inspired by Norwegian nature and legends. She covers a diverse spectrum of styles: figurative, realism, symbolism, abstract.  Biography  Eva Margot Roux (born Johansen) was born on January 10, 1944 and grew up in a working family in Mosby, a small town ten kilometers north of Kristiansand in Norway. Very early on she revealed the gifts of designer and storyteller. A few years later, she followed a course in drawing by correspondence (NKS, Norwegian course in correspondence), and followed courses in painting with the painter Arne Solheim in Kristiansand. She left for Paris in January 1966 until 1970. Works like \\"Le Grand Fossard\\" or \\"Une église\\" testify to her stay in France. She returned to settle in Mosby in 1971 where she devoted herself exclusively to her painting, and inaugurated her active career from 1977 by exhibiting regularly at Kristiansand. Eva joined the world of young \\"non-established\\" artists with whom she set up a group called \\"Cinq\\" and held several exhibitions from 1982 to 1985. Eva Margot multiplied individual or group exhibitions and produced hundreds of works up to on its last day, September 7, 2019. Eva Margot attended and collaborated with several Norwegian artists such as Wigo Aadnevik who supported her in her artistic project. He made a portrait of her in 19673. Between 1982 and 1985 she notably collaborated with the artists Sissel Stangenes and Alf Solbakken. She had friendly relations with artists like Ingrid Lønnou and Else Marie Jakobsen.  Work  Her style ranges from a delicate, sometimes childish lyricism to a brutal tragic, passing from an expressive symbolism to unusual or abstract perspectives. Her painting, of traditional invoice, contains strong colors and a rich light. Thus, sensitive and attentive to those around her from childhood and later to the events of her time, if Eva Margot often staged men and women, their reciprocal relationships and the relationship with nature, she always took great care, down to the smallest details, the aesthetic side of each painting.  Exhibitions and events  The press has followed with interest the painter's career, throughout her career.

Located in Forsyth Park, it consists of a tall shaft topped with a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier. Two additional statues honoring notable Confederate army officers surround the monument, which is protected by a fence. Originally known as the Confederate Monument, it was dedicated in 1875 to honor Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War. Following the Unite the Right rally, the city of Savannah renamed the structure in 2018. The monument is one of the oldest and largest Confederate monument in Georgia.  History  The monument as it originally appeared, with statues of Silence and Judgment The idea for a public Confederate memorial in Savannah, Georgia began to gain traction in 1869, shortly after the relocation of Georgian soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg to Laurel Grove Cemetery. Following this, the Ladies' Memorial Association in Savannah began to hold fundraising events, such as bake sales, raising almost $25,000 for the construction of a Confederate monument. While the association originally planned for the monument to be located in the Confederate section of Laurel Grove Cemetery, they ultimately decided to erect the monument in Forsyth Park. This decision proved controversial with many in the general public, who pointed out that Forsyth Park was, at the time, on the outskirts of the city, but the association contended that the statue would be overshadowed by trees and surrounding architecture if it was placed in any of the squares of Savannah. A public meeting at Independent Presbyterian Church in May 1874 settled the issue of location in favor of Forsyth Park. The association, not wanting to employ an architect from any northern states, instead commissioned Welsh-born Canadian architect Robert Reid to design the monument. In April 1873, Reid visited Savannah at the invitation of the association and agreed with the location of Forsyth Park. On June 16, 1874, the cornerstone for the monument was placed as part of a large festival that also helped to raise more funds for the monument's completion. Reid was given a great deal of artistic liberty in designing the monument, with the association only requiring that the monument have a \\"life-sized figure worthy of the honor and respect due the common Confederate soldier.\\" Not wanting to use materials from northern states, the monument was constructed using sandstone from Nova Scotia and was constructed in Canada. By the Fall of 1874, the monument was completed and shipped from Canada to Savannah via a British schooner to avoid transporting the monument over northern states. The ship arrived in Savannah on December 25, 1874, but an issue with customs caused a delay in the transportation of the monument to the park. By March 1875, much of the monument had been assembled, and on May 24, 1875, a dedication was held that attracted many and featured several notable Confederate generals as guests of honor. The monument consisted of a shaft on top of a earthen base. On top of this pedestal was a life-sized statue of a woman in a robe named Silence, and at the base of the monument was another statue of a woman called Judgment. Both statues had been shipped via New York City. Despite the fanfare that had accompanied the monument's dedication, public opinion soon soured towards the monument. Many felt the statue was too ornate to represent the common soldier. Writing about the monument several decades after its unveiling, Savannah mayor and historian Thomas Gamble called the monument \\"a distinct disappointment\\" that was \\"too symbolic\\" and \\"lacking in charm.\\"  Confederate Soldier statue  263x263px In early 1878, prominent Savannah citizen George Wymberly Jones De Renne proposed replacing Silence with a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier at his own expense. The Ladies' Memorial Association approved this idea in March and again in April, and following this, De Renne hired New York-based architect David Richards to craft the statue. For the statue, simply called Confederate Soldier, De Renne and Richards wanted to depict a battle-worn soldier, which was rare at the time, as few Confederate monuments depicted soldiers. Former Confederate Captain Hamilton Branch assisted Richards with the statue, sending him multiple articles of clothing he had worn in battle, as well as a rifle used during the war. According to Branch, the attire presented a soldier, \\"as he looked when he marched and fought, and not when he danced and fluted at home.\\" The statue depicted the soldier in parade rest, which, according to De Renne, \\"indicates submission to the inevitable, without excluding the idea of manly struggle to avoid it.\\" Richards used photos of Savannah veteran A. S. Bacon as a model. On May 22, 1879, Confederate Soldier was hoisted atop the shaft, with Silence and Judgment removed from the monument. Silence was relocated to the Confederate section of Laurel Grove Cemetery, while Judgment was sent to Thomasville, Georgia to be used as part of that town's Civil War memorial.  Additional statues  Bust of Francis S. Bartow, with the Confederate monument in the background In 1910, two statues honoring Confederate generals were moved next to the monument. Busts of Lafayette McLaws and Francis S. Bartow were moved from Chippewa Square in Savannah to make way for a monument honoring James Oglethorpe.  Renaming and other proposed alterations  After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, the City of Savannah announced the creation of the Confederate Memorial Task Force on October 30, 2017. The task force's operations consisted of historic research, observational fieldwork, and a public survey in order to decide what, if anything, to change about the monument. The culmination of these efforts were eight recommendations published in a report on December 22, 2017. On February 14, these recommendations were adopted by the city council. This included the relocation of the two busts to Laurel Grove Cemetery and renaming the monument from \\"Confederate Monument\\" to \\"Civil War Memorial\\". A bronze plaque was also to be added that would read, “This memorial was originally erected in 1875 to the Confederate dead, redesigned in 1879, and rededicated in 2018 to all the dead of the American Civil War.” On April 26, 2019, Governor Brian Kemp signed into effect Georgia SB77, which explicitly stated, \\"A monument shall not be relocated to a museum, cemetery, or mausoleum unless it was originally placed at such location.\\" This effectively delayed the implementation of most of the task force's recommendations. On June 18, 2020, the Savannah - Chatham County Historic Site and Monument Commission held a special meeting on the subject of the Civil War Memorial and passed a motion to send a letter in support of the task force recommendations and necessary budget allocations to the city council.  Vandalism  On June 10, 2020, as part of George Floyd protests occurring both nationwide and in Savannah, the bust of McLaws was vandalized, with a white hood placed over the bust and a raised fist spray painted on the pedestal. Following the incident, a descendant of McLaws offered to buy and remove the statue from the park. Almost a month later, on July 9, the statue of Silence in Laurel Grove Cemetery was vandalized, with the words “Silence- No More” spray painted on the statue.

When the Chavín culture declined, on the north coast, small lordships that were in contact united and formed the Salinar culture, which began between 500 and 200 BCE and ended around 300 CE. This culture is the one that marked the transition between the Chavin culture and the advent of the Mochica culture. During this time, irrigation systems were expanded, significantly increasing the agricultural area. The settlements were generally small and isolated, but there are sites of urban proportions, such as Cerro Arena in the Moche Valley, an extensive site with about 2000 stone structures distributed over a surface of 2 km2, where there are habitation areas, ceremonial and administrative centers. The culture built fortifications to protect the towns on the highest part of the hills, which indicates extensive wars during the existence of this culture, ones where all the people intervened. They used hand-shaped odontiform adobes in their construction, houses were generally square in plan with low walls and wooden columns. Graves took an elongated ellipsoid shape; corpses were spread out with their legs crossed and their bodies reclined to the right, wrapped in cloth and covered with jewels and ceramic offerings, and almost always with a gold foil in their mouths. Salinarian ceramic presented a change from black ceramic to red ceramic with white paint. Bottles with stirrup handles were found alongside the innovative figurine bottles with bridge handles.

Her memoir The Memory Palace received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Memoir/Autobiography and her novel The Wonderling is being adapted into a film. Early life Myra Herr was born in 1959 to mother Norma Herr. By the age of four, her father Paul Herr became divorced from her mother who had also begun showing signs of mental illness. As Herr grew older with her sister Rachel, Norma was diagnosed with schizophrenia and attacked her daughters consistently. By the time the girls are around 30, Herr and her sister left Norma in their hometown and changed their named and address. Under the new name of Mira Bartók, she traveled the world to Florence, Lapland, and Israel as a way to escape her mother. She painted in Florence, ran writing workshops in Israel, and earned a Fulbright Scholarship to Lapland. Until her mother's death in 2007, Bartók only communicated with her through letters sent through post office boxes. Education and accident During the 1990s, Bartók published several children's books on ancient civilizations that focused on their culture. She later enrolled in the Master's of Fine Arts program at University of Massachusetts Amherst and graduated in 1998. The following year, she suffered a brain injury causing memory loss when her car was hit by a truck on the New York Thruway. As a result of the injury, she was unable to complete freelance work and nearly became homeless. She began applying for grants from arts foundations and she received enough funding to sustain her until she began to recover. Career In 2007, Bartók and her sister were informed that their mother was dying of cancer and they returned to Cleveland to be with her. During the final three weeks she spent with her mother, she found a storage unit filled with her mother’s letters, journals and personal effects. Following her mother's death, Bartók began to write her memoir but had trouble with her memory due to her previous accident. While struggling to write, she read of Italian Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci who taught that one should use imagery to assist in their memory recall. Using this technique, she was able to pen her memoir that was soon published through Simon and Schuster in 2011. Her memoir, titled The Memory Palace, received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Memoir/Autobiography and was a finalist for the Goodreads Choice Awards Best Memoir & Autobiography. While working on her second novel The Wonderling, she sold the rights to Fox 2000 Pictures to be developed into a film under director Stephen Daldry. The book revolved around the life of Number 13, a part fox, part human groundling who lives under tyrannical rule. Personal life Bartók is married to Doug Plavin and they share a dog.

The game takes places across multiple locations with differing environmental conditions, including desert, snow, forest, mountains, swampland, and deep-sea diving. Although an overall map is available, players cannot \\"fast forward\\" their travel to these locations; instead, they must take direct control of their transportation during the journey and respond to events that occur on the way. Players also have the ability to upgrade their transportation (alongside their weapons and armor) as the game progresses. Between missions, players can return to the safety of the game's home town in order to rest and prepare for further adventures (such as talking with NPCs, gathering information on the next location through library research, and preparing for its weather conditions). According to Neostream, this preparation is key to further success: > \\"You will need to prepare for any unexpected encounters with the weather, > have the necessary intel about the region, equip your gear as you see fit, > get on a vehicle and react to unexpected events that arise during your > journey ... Depending on how you prepare for the mission and how you react > and respond to events will determine how easily or hard you can achieve the > missions.\\" The game also includes roguelike elements: In the event of a player's character dying, that character cannot be resurrected; however, the player can take subsequent characters to that same spot in order to recover any lost equipment.  Visual style  The game leans towards a minimalist visual style, with only a minimal user interface and avoidance of menus wherever possible, instead requiring players to ascertain details by observing visual cues and communicating with their character. For example, characters will begin to limp if they are hurt, cough if they become sick, or shiver if they become too cold. Similarly, although the various characters available to players will have different traits and stats (e.g. boastful characters hiding when they are injured, female-obsessed characters having narrower vision), these will not be explicitly displayed to the player, instead requiring them to be deduced. Neostream have provided the following description of the game's graphical style: > \\"As opposed to developing fully life-like, high polygon characters and > objects with intense level of textures, the intended design essence and > aesthetics is to create a subtle but powerful sense of emptiness for each > player to fill for themselves throughout the game experience.\\"  Co-operative multiplayer  The game also supports co-operative multiplayer (including local multiplayer), where more than one player participates in the same mission. Additionally, the game features the possibility of random encounters between players.  Plot  Little Devil Inside takes place in a 19th century, Victorian-inspired setting, with elements of steampunk. The developers describe it as a \\"surreal, unrealistic world ... somewhere between heaven and hell\\". The main character is an explorer, employed by a college professor to travel the world in search of the supernatural and other unusual incidents; however, the game also takes a satirical angle on the video game cliché of hunting monsters for financial reward by also exploring the more mundane aspects of such characters' lives and their financial inequality with their employers. In the words of Neostream: > \\"This game is not just about killing arch-demons and saving the world. Take > in the atmosphere and live a realistic life in an unrealistic world. This is > a game that tells stories about people with ‘unusual’ jobs such as hunting > monsters and what happens in their everyday life doing so.\\"  Development and release  Little Devil Inside was developed by Seoul’s Neostream Interactive (who had initially begun in 1998 as a multimedia design & production company) originally using the Unity Engine, then later switching to the Unreal Engine by Epic Games. The game was first announced through a Kickstarter campaign in April 2015, alongside a pre-alpha trailer and gameplay footage, and an entry on Steam Greenlight. At the time of the original campaign, the game had an approximate release window of fall 2016. Backed by over 5,000 people, the Kickstarter campaign raised by its completion in May 2015. Subsequently, the game's original release window was pushed back, due to an increase in its scope. In December 2017, the developers released a new trailer for the game, and began communicating a planned release date of \\"late 2018\\", with PC planned as the first release platform; however, that window passed without the game being released. The game's original campaign stated that it was planned for release on Steam platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux), Playstation 4, and Xbox One, with Nintendo's Wii-U console added later as a stretch goal; however, during the PlayStation 5 reveal event in June 2020, it was announced that Little Devil Inside would be a timed console exclusive for the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. In a subsequent message to their Kickstarter backers, Neostream announced that they plan to release concurrently with PC as part of their agreement with Sony; however no mention was made of Xbox or Nintendo platform releases. A later website update for the game confirmed a planned release for Windows, and that releases for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch (replacing that of the Wii-U) were still planned for once the Playstation exclusivity period expires.

Founded on June 14,1865, it is the oldest daily newspaper in the Pennsylvania Oil Region.  History  The Titusville Morning Herald was founded on June, 14, 1865 by brothers William and Henry Bloss. William Bloss, born in Rochester on March 25, 1831, was both a newspaperman and an abolitionist. After serving in the American Civil War, he migrated to Western Pennsylvania in search of opportunities in the burgeoning oil industry. William, joined by his brother Henry, purchased the Titusville Gazette and Oil Creek Reporter in 1865. The brothers regularly disagreed both about management of the paper In 1872, Henry and his partner, J. H. Cogwell, bought William's share of the newspaper. Henry continued to grow the paper, purchasing various other local newspapers including The Evening Courier, The Evening Club, The Evening Journal, The Morning Star, The Evening Press, The Evening News, and The Daily Courier. The paper chronicled the oil industry as it developed in the wake of the discovery of petroleum in Oil Creek and its extraction with the establishment of Drake Well in 1859 by Colonel Edwin Drake. The Herald provided coverage of oil prices along Oil Creek and chronicled the establishment of the Oil Creek Railroad in 1865. The Titusville Morning Herald also covered social issues affecting Titusville, a town that had grown exponentially in size and population during the oil boom. The paper features stories on gangs, prostitution and arson. When a devastating fire broke out in 1866, which devastated commercial buildings downtown (though sparing the Herald offices), Henry Bloss and the other editors recommended lynching those found culpable. When Henry Bloss died in 1893, his wife Sarah ran the paper until her death in 1916. Their son, Joseph Bloss, took over the paper and ran it until 1921. After Joseph's tenure as editor, the Herald was sold to Edgar Taft Stevenson. Edgar Stevenson, called \\"the newspaper man's newspaper man,\\" edited the newspaper until he died in 1956. The Stevenson family published the paper for the next few generations. Michael Sample, the current publisher, has held this role since 1993.

For a longer and more detailed introduction, see Superheavy element#Introduction. A graphic depiction of a nuclear fusion reaction. Two nuclei fuse into one, emitting a neutron. Reactions that created new elements to this moment were similar, with the only possible difference that several singular neutrons sometimes were released, or none at all. The heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the two react. The material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target, which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei. Two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough; normally, nuclei (all positively charged) repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion. The strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus; beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus. Coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse: when two nuclei approach each other, they usually remain together for approximately 10−20 seconds and then part ways (not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction) rather than form a single nucleus. If fusion does occur, the temporary merger—termed a compound nucleus—is an excited state. To lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state, a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons, which carry away the energy. This occurs in approximately 10−16 seconds after the initial collision. The beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber, the separator; if a new nucleus is produced, it is carried with this beam. In the separator, the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides (that of the original beam and any other reaction products) and transferred to a surface-barrier detector, which stops the nucleus. The exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked; also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival. The transfer takes about 10−6 seconds; in order to be detected, the nucleus must survive this long. The nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered, and the location, the energy, and the time of the decay are measured. Stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction. However, its range is very short; as nuclei become larger, its influence on the outermost nucleons (protons and neutrons) weakens. At the same time, the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons, as it has unlimited range. Nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion: alpha decay and spontaneous fission; these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements. Alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles, and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay; if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus, the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically. Spontaneous fission, however, produces various nuclei as products, so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters. The information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors: location, energy, and time of arrival of a particle to the detector, and those of its decay. The physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed. Often, provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects; errors in interpreting data have been made.

In 2020, in light of protests and increased coverage of racism in Ireland, Joseph has spoken about the importance of education about tackling racism that begins in the home as well as outlining more personal strategies for countering everyday racism. She has cited the need to overhaul the Irish education system to also incorporate anti-racist material into the curriculum, as well as the need for more diversity within teaching staff. She has highlighted stories from young black Irish people about the racism they experienced in schools. She has spoken about her own experiences of racism in Ireland, including the use of a racist parody Twitter account pretending to be her.

When studying these transformations, the dual numbers are often interpreted as representing oriented lines on the plane. The Laguerre transformations map lines to lines, and include in particular all isometries of the plane (ignoring possible orientation reversals). Strictly speaking, these transformations act on the dual number projective line, which adjoins to the dual numbers a set of points at infinity. Topologically, this projective line is equivalent to a cylinder. Points on this cylinder are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with oriented lines on the plane.  Definition  A Laguerre transformation is a function of the form z\\\\mapsto\\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} where a,b,c,d are all dual numbers, z lies on the dual number projective line, and ad-bc is not a zero divisor. A dual number is a hypercomplex number of the form x+y\\\\epsilon where \\\\epsilon^2=0 but \\\\epsilon eq0. This can be compared to the complex numbers which are of the form x+yi where i^2=-1. The dual number projective line adjoins to the dual numbers a set of numbers of the form \\\\frac 1 {k\\\\epsilon} for any real k.  Line coordinates  A line which makes an angle \\\\theta with the x-axis, and whose x-intercept is denoted s, is represented by the dual number : z = \\\\tan(\\\\theta/2)(1 + \\\\epsilon s). The above doesn't make sense when the line is parallel to the x-axis. In that case, if \\\\theta = \\\\pi then set z = \\\\frac{-2}{\\\\epsilon R} where R is the y-intercept of the line. This may not appear to be valid, as one is dividing by a zero divisor, but this is a valid point on the projective dual line. If \\\\theta = 2\\\\pi then set z = \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\epsilon R. Finally, observe that these coordinates represent oriented lines. An oriented line is an ordinary line with one of two possible orientations attached to it. This can be seen from the fact that if \\\\theta is increased by \\\\pi then the resulting dual number representative is not the same.  Matrix representations  It's possible to express the above line coordinates as homogeneous coordinates z = [\\\\sin(\\\\theta/2) + \\\\frac12\\\\epsilon R\\\\cos(\\\\theta/2):\\\\cos(\\\\theta/2)-\\\\frac12\\\\epsilon R\\\\sin(\\\\theta/2)] where R is the perpendicular distance of the line from the origin. This representation has numerous advantages: One advantage is that there is no need to break into different cases, such as parallel and non-parallel. The other advantage is that these homogeneous coordinates can be interpreted as vectors, allowing us to multiply them by a matrix. Every Laguerre transformation can be represented as a 2x2 matrix whose entries are dual numbers. Additionally, as long as the determinant of a 2x2 dual-numbered matrix is not nilpotent, then it represents a Laguerre transformation.  Points, oriented lines and oriented circles  Laguerre transformations do not act on points. This is because if three oriented lines pass through the same point, their images under a Laguerre transformation do not have to meet at one point. Laguerre transformations can be seen as acting on oriented circles as well as oriented lines. An oriented circle is one which either has a clockwise or anti-clockwise orientation. An anti-clockwise orientation is considered to be positive, while a clockwise orientation is considered to be negative. The radius of a negatively oriented circle is negative. Whenever a set of oriented lines are tangent to the same oriented circle, their images under a Laguerre transformation share this property, but possibly for a different circle. An oriented line is tangent to an oriented circle if the two figures touch and their orientations agree.  Profile  Figure 1: Two circles initially with opposite orientations undergoing axial dilatation The following can be found in Isaak Yaglom's Complex numbers in geometry. Mappings of the form z \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{pz - q}{\\\\bar q z + \\\\bar p} express rigid body motions. The matrix representations of these transformations span a subalgebra isomorphic to the dual-complex numbers. The mapping z \\\\mapsto -z represents a reflection about the x-axis, followed by a reversal of orientation. The transformation z \\\\mapsto 1/z expresses a reflection about the y-axis, followed by a reversal of orientation. An axial dilatation by t units is a transformation of the form \\\\frac{2z + \\\\epsilon t}{(-\\\\epsilon t) z + 2}. A dilatation by t units increases the radius of all oriented circles by t units while preserving their centres. If a circle has negative orientation, then its radius is considered negative, and therefore for some positive values of t the circle actually shrinks. A progressive dilatation is depicted in Figure 1, in which two circles of opposite orientations undergo the same dilatation. On lines, an axial dilatation by t units maps any line z to a line z' such that z and z' are parallel, and the perpendicular distance between z and z' is t. Lines that are parallel but have opposite orientations move in opposite directions. Figure 2: A grid of lines undergoing z \\\\mapsto kz for k varying between 1 and 10. Figure 3: Two circles that initially differ only in orientation undergoing the transformation z \\\\mapsto kz for k varying from 1 and 10. The transformation z \\\\mapsto k z for a value of k that's real preserves the x-intercept of a line, while changing its angle to the x-axis. See Figure 2 to observe the effect on a grid of lines (including the x axis in the middle) and Figure 3 to observe the effect on two circles that differ initially only in orientation (to see that the outcome is sensitive to orientation). All Laguerre transformations are either: * Direct Euclidean isometries followed by an axial dilatation. * Indirect Euclidean isometries, followed by an axial dilatation, followed by orientation reversal. * Indirect Euclidean isometries, followed by a transformation of the form z \\\\mapsto k z for k a real number, followed by orientation reversal.

Along with Roland Feneulle (9 September 1953-22 October 2013), he was convicted in 1980 of the murder of the Steyaert family on 23 June 1979.  Crime  On June 23, 1979, Horion and Feneulle raided the home of car dealer Roland Steyaert in Sint-Amandsberg. Roland Steyaert was murdered in his garage, followed by the rest of the family: wife Leona Van Lancker, their 13-year-old daughter Hilde, as well as 22-year-old daughter Anne-Marie and her 24-year-old fiancé Marc De Croock, who robbery came home unsuspectingly.  Conviction and imprisonment  The police discovered a connection with an earlier murder case: the one on Hélène Lichachevski, a Polish shopkeeper in the port of Ghent who was killed on 9 February 1979 with the same weapon. Two days after the murder of the Steyaert family, Feneulle was arrested, and Horion was arrested the following day. Horion, defended by the young Jef Vermassen, and Feneulle were found guilty of sixfold murder in 1980 by the East Flemish court of assizes and sentenced to death, which was immediately converted into life imprisonment, in which Horion is still serving. After being locked up in the prison of Leuven Central and Bruges for decades, Horion was transferred to the Hasselt Prison in November 2009, on request. from his lawyer when Horion, at the time of an escape plague that reigned in Belgian prisons, was banned from walking to the open-air courtyard. Horion managed to escape in October 1982. After being in hiding in the Netherlands for a month and a half, Horion was arrested again. Feneulle was imprisoned in the prison of Bruges and died there at the age of 60.

Uses  During the copy propagation stage of program compilation, instances of a target are replaced with assignments to their values. During this process, it is necessary for the compiler to understand which instances of a target are being accessed so that appropriate substitution may occur, related to the concept of reaching definition in reaching analysis. This is done with the purpose of simplifying code before execution: if the number of upwards exposed uses of an assignment is zero, it does not contribute to the end result of the code and can be safely removed. This is also useful for improving code security during the compilation stages.  Example  Consider the following pseudocode: x = 1 y = z if False: x = 0 else: x = y + 2 It is safe to assume that line 5 will never occur, as demonstrated by the number of upwards exposed uses for this point being zero. This can therefore be simplified: y = z x = z + 2 This leads to an end result which is less complex to compile, and more efficient to run. This also meets the definition of reaching definition: In this context, upwards flow analysis was the technique used to demonstrate the needs for reaching definition. Additional techniques allow for more complex analysis of more deeply intertwined or complex control flow problems, such as those with various forms of loops.

It is the thirty-sixth episode overall and originally aired in the United States on NBC on December 6, 2018 as the show's mid-season finale. The episode was written by Josh Siegal and Dylan Morgan and directed by Morgan Sackett. The plot picks up from the end of the previous episode, with the four humans entering Janet's \\"void\\" to escape demons from the Bad Place. However, upon arriving, they find themselves transformed into versions of Janet. While there, Eleanor tries to address her romantic feelings for Chidi; when he denies any feelings for her, she has an identity crisis that threatens to destroy Janet's void. Meanwhile, Michael and Janet visit Accounting, the section of the afterlife that calculates point totals for people's good and bad actions during their lives, and try to figure out if the Bad Place is manipulating the points system. The premise of the episode originated during The Good Places second season, and planning for it began earlier than normal due to filming challenges. D'Arcy Carden, who plays multiple versions of Janet in the episode, spent a significant amount of time preparing for her role by watching her castmates and emulating their characters. Upon its release, the episode was seen by 2.58 million viewers and received praise from critics, with Carden's performance receiving widespread acclaim. The episode won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, and Siegal and Morgan were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for their work on the episode.  Plot  Upon arriving in Janet's (D'Arcy Carden) void, the four humans are accidentally transformed into versions of Janet. The original Janet gives each person different clothes to identify them before she and Michael (Ted Danson) leave to visit Accounting. The humans stay in Janet's void, as they are now fugitives within the afterlife. Janet also urges the humans to not summon anything, as it could destroy her void. Michael and Janet meet the head accountant, Neil (Stephen Merchant). When the two voice concerns that the Bad Place is tampering with the points system, Neil insists that is impossible but agrees to show them the system anyway. He explains that everything someone does on Earth is logged and assigned a positive or negative point value. If something new occurs, an accountant gives it a value based on its intentions, effects, and other factors. Every new value is verified by three billion other accountants, leaving no room for tampering. Despite this, Michael asks to see Doug Forcett's file. In Janet's void, Eleanor-Janet talks with Chidi-Janet about their past romantic relationships. Chidi-Janet argues those experiences did not happen to him because they occurred in a different life and cites several philosophers to prove his point. Eleanor-Janet becomes frustrated and thinks he is avoiding a discussion of his feelings. Neil finds the \\"Book of Dougs\\" and says Doug Forcett is on track for the Bad Place. Michael considers this proof of tampering, as Doug has spent his life devoted to good actions. He asks to see a file for someone on track for the Good Place; Neil reveals that nobody has reached the Good Place in 521 years. Elsewhere, Jason-Janet and Tahani-Janet discover signs of Janet's romantic feelings for Jason. After more failed attempts to get Chidi-Janet to talk, Eleanor-Janet gives up and wonders why she is even bothering to reach out to him. Her identity crisis causes her to change into new bodies, and Janet's void begins to collapse. To restore her identity, Chidi-Janet lists off Eleanor's memories and the good things she has done before ultimately kissing her. This causes the four humans to regain their normal appearances, but it also forces them out of Janet's void. Michael, Janet, and the humans flee; Michael takes the Book of Dougs with him. The six escape via a vacuum tube and arrive in a mailroom. Eleanor (Kristen Bell) realizes they are in the Good Place.  Production = Development and writing  D'Arcy Carden plays multiple versions of Janet in the episode and received acclaim for her performance. According to series creator Michael Schur, the idea for an episode featuring multiple Janets originated during the second season, over a year before the episode aired. Planning for the episode began right after the second season ended production. At one point, the idea was to be limited to just the first act, but Schur and the show's staff realized they needed to use the concept as more than a gimmick, which led to the idea of Eleanor questioning her sense of self while trapped inside a Janet. The writers also met with philosophical advisors Todd May and Pamela Hieronymi to learn about concepts of identity and the self before writing the episode. Writers Josh Siegal and Dylan Morgan sent a draft of the script to May for input; he suggested small tweaks to improve how the relevant philosophical theories were explained. Schur told D'Arcy Carden, who plays Janet, to begin preparing for the episode in March 2018, four months before the episode would be filmed, and the cast as a whole began rehearsals for it earlier than normal. Carden later said she was \\"stunned\\" when she learned about the episode and was grateful that the writers and producers trusted her to pull it off. For the episode, Carden plays a wide range of characters, including her normal character, each of the four humans as a Janet, a \\"Neutral Janet\\" in Accounting, and one scene in which she plays Eleanor pretending to be Jason. To provide references for the impressions, her co-stars recorded footage of their performances for Carden to listen to and review, including a rehearsal on set with the cast playing their usual characters. The actors' movements during these performances were also tracked for use with special effects. Additionally, Carden followed the actors around when she was not in scenes and would mimic what they were doing. The other cast members provided help in various ways as Carden was learning to portray them; for instance, William Jackson Harper sent a copy of Chidi's lines the way he liked to memorize them, while Manny Jacinto showed her a video that inspired his portrayal of Jason. Carden later explained that she struggled to perform her impression of Harper as Chidi even though she could imagine it, while she found Kristen Bell's subtle actions to be hard to emulate.  Filming  Stephen Merchant guest-stars in the episode as Neil, the head of Accounting. For the episode, Janet's void was represented by an entirely white set, though director Morgan Sackett decided to add furniture to prevent the audience from becoming bored by the setting. Filming required significantly more planning and visual effects than normal; Schur later called it \\"the opposite of how [they] usually make television\\" due to the precision required. Though some scenes used stand-ins in costumes and wigs, many were filmed with only metal poles to represent the other characters. Carden remarked that \\"you kind of lose your mind a little bit\\" in those situations and called it the hardest part of filming for her. To film the kiss, Carden had to kiss a pair of wax lips placed atop a pole, which was a particularly difficult shot due to how her body had to be positioned and the alignment of the shots. After combining her multiple roles, Carden spent about 40 minutes performing in the episode, which was only 22 minutes long. At one point, Eleanor transforms into a series of different individuals as she loses her sense of self. Morgan and Siegal credited the idea to Schur and explained that they carefully scripted what each new person said for both emotional impact and humor based upon who would say the line. In the same scene, visual effects producer David Niednagel used special effects to simulate the void and the furniture breaking up as Eleanor's struggles continue. Carden, Schur, and Siegal all remarked that there were instances during filming when the crew wondered if the final product would make any sense. Stephen Merchant, co-creator of the British version of The Office, makes a guest appearance in the episode; Schur worked as a writer on The Offices American adaptation. In the episode, Merchant holds a mug reading \\"Existence's Best Boss\\", an allusion to a similar mug used by Michael Scott. The mug was printed with this slogan, but Merchant held it the wrong way during filming, so the words were reapplied using special effects during post-production. In one scene, Janet accidentally sings an excerpt of Cher's \\"Believe\\" as her void becomes unstable. Carden sang a version of the song for the episode, which was then auto-tuned, but Schur explained that they ultimately went with the original version because it was easier to get permission to use it that way.  Reception = Ratings  In its original broadcast on December 6, 2018, \\"Janet(s)\\" was seen by 2.58 million American viewers and received a 0.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic. This placed the show fourth in its timeslot, behind Thursday Night Football, Young Sheldon, and A Charlie Brown Christmas. Both measurements were the lowest of the season up to that point. After factoring in seven-day DVR viewership, the episode rose to 4.23 million viewers and a 1.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic.  Reviews  The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, with many considering it a major improvement over the season's earlier episodes. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- grade, calling it the ideal version of a mid-season finale with plenty of \\"incident and action\\". He remarked that while Janet had been sidelined for much of the third season, this episode marked a significant course correction. Noel Murray of Vulture gave the episode 5 out of 5 stars, calling the idea to turn the humans into Janets a \\"masterstroke\\" that elevated an otherwise routine B-story. He deemed it a \\"dividing line\\" within the history of the show and, like Perkins, praised it for giving Carden more to do as Janet after receiving smaller roles earlier in the season. Alec Bojalad of Den of Geek also gave the episode 5 out of 5 stars, praising it for both the creativity of the premise and the emotional truths the humans face. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone, remarked that the show's return to the afterlife helped to produce one of its best episodes. He found himself appreciating the Eleanor-Chidi relationship more and praised Michael's growth as he took the situation into his own hands. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox found the episode to be \\"a surprisingly romantic and sweet story\\" and praised the setup for future episodes, particularly after the less enjoyable episodes from earlier in the season. In a retrospective review, Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo called the episode a \\"fantastic exploration of identity\\". Carden's performance in the episode, which was described as a \\"showcase\\" for her character, was widely singled out for acclaim. Brian Grubb of Uproxx called it \\"[o]ne of the best television comedy performances by one person\\" he could recall. Perkins called it \\"marvelous\\", noting the details she was able to incorporate into each impression. Dani Di Placido of Forbes applauded Carden's ability to realistically depict the conflict between Eleanor and Chidi without using the main actors. Bojalad echoed this sentiment and described the episode as Carden \\"at the absolute height of [her] powers\\". VanDerWerff praised the show and Carden for committing to the premise and nailing the performances, suggesting that Carden deserved an Emmy for the performance. The editors of Paste later named Carden's performance as Janet as their top television performance of 2018 and singled out her role in \\"Janet(s)\\" for displaying her talent.  Awards and nominations  The episode resulted in several nominations for major awards. It received the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, the show's second consecutive win in the category. For their work on the episode, Siegal and Morgan were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, ultimately losing to Phoebe Waller- Bridge for \\"Episode 1\\" from Fleabag. The episode was also nominated for an ADG Excellence in Production Design Award for Half Hour Single-Camera Series and a Golden Reel Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing — Live Action Under 35:00. Some people, including Schur, felt that Carden's lack of an Emmy nomination was a snub.

A large anticipated production run in 1930 ended early when the company collapsed in the Great Depression, with only five or six registered. Design and development The Skylark, designed by Chester Cummings, was a cantilever, low wing, monoplane with wings tapered in plan out to semi-elliptical tips. They were built around twin box spars and were fabric covered. The prototype, type SL-1, was powered by a Velie M-5 engine but this was replaced in production SL-2s by a LeBlond 60-5D. Both were five cylinder radial engines. Behind the engine the fuselage was a steel tube structure with fabric covering, flat-sided but with raised, rounded decking. The Skylark had two open cockpits in tandem, one close to the leading edge and the other over the rear of the wing. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a conventional, angular tail. Its tailplane and elevators were together trapezoidal in plan. The fin had a cropped triangular profile and carried a rectangular, balanced rudder. The Skylark had conventional landing gear with its mainwheels on split axles mounted, like the forward drag struts, on the lower fuselage longerons. Its shock absorbing legs were on the forward wing spars near the roots. Operational history The prototype Skylark was first flown in 1929, though the date is not known. By October 1929 an agreement had been signed between Watkins Aircraft and Steel Inc., a Los Angeles steel exporter, for the construction of 330 Skylarks with deliveries beginning 1 January 1930.. These plans were rapidly abandoned as the depression deepened in 1930 and only five or six were completed. Variants ; SL-1 Skylark: Prototype with Velie M-5 five cylinder radial engine.

It is a world that takes place in the mind of Boyd Cooper, a paranoid security guard of an asylum, which the protagonist Raz explores. The area has unusual gravity, causing Raz to be pulled towards different roads when he is near and walking at unusual angles. Multiple games have been compared to this level, including Jazzpunk, We Happy Few, and Super Mario Galaxy. The game's director, Tim Schafer, was responsible for the level concept and its dialogue. He decided to create a conspiracy-based level around \\"I am the milkman, my milk is delicious,\\" a phrase made up by a staff member at Double Fine. Schafer found fascination with conspiracy theorists, trying to create comedy with mental illness without punching down at those with mental illnesses. Art director Scott Campbell wanted to emphasize the paranoia Boyd experiences, accomplishing this by adding G-Men and the feeling of being watched to the level. Concept artist Peter Chan depicted roads twisting in the sky, wanting to reflect how Boyd's logic and reason were twisted. Erik Robson, who handled game design, designed the level to resemble a traditional adventure game, having players collect items to solve puzzles. \\"Milkman Conspiracy\\" has been generally well-received, becoming a Psychonauts fan favorite. Game Revolution and The Escapist writers praised it as one of the best platform levels in gaming, while author Daniel Hardcastle called it one of the best areas in video games. Its world design was praised Eurogamer staff, which felt it is what made the level stand out so much. It has received attention for its depiction of mental health, with author Alice Brumby discussing how Boyd's mind is the most \\"disordered\\" among Psychonauts cast. Summary \\"Milkman Conspiracy,\\" like certain other areas in Psychonauts, this area takes place in the mind of a person, that of paranoid security guard Boyd Cooper. Boyd is tasked with guarding an asylum and makes frequent references to \\"the Milkman.\\" The area in his mind is depicted as a suburban neighborhood where the roads are impossibly twisted and cameras can be found everywhere. As players control Raz through this world, the gravity may pull them to different paths and angles. The world is populated by G-Men, who watch protagonist Raz suspiciously while using tools incorrectly in an attempt to blend in while looking for someone called the Milkman. Players collect various tools to try to blend in with G-Men holding the same tools in order to gain access to more parts of the level. In addition to the G-Men, there is also the Rainbow Squirts, a group of children lead by a woman called the Den Mother. Raz discovers that the G-Men wish to remove the Milkman from Boyd's mind, while the Rainbow Squirts were trying to keep him contained. The Milkman escapes and Raz is ejected from Boyd's mind. Boyd assumes the persona of the Milkman in reality before burning down the asylum with a Molotov cocktail. The world has various objects called Figments scattered throughout the area, representing different images such as lawn chairs and children. Concept and creation Psychonauts director and writer Tim Schafer was one the level's creators. The concept for \\"Milkman Conspiracy\\" first emerged when a staff member at the game's developer Double Fine came up with the phrase \\"I am the milkman, my milk is delicious.\\" This line caused various ideas to converge for the game's director, Tim Schafer, leading him to create a conspiracy-focused level. Schafer held a fascination with conspiracy theorists, wanting to know \\"what was going on inside their heads.\\" He found conspiracy theorists funny, though he also felt sad that people could be so easily mislead by people on the Internet. He created a chart of conspiracies centered around the level's central character, Boyd Cooper, using various theories that Schafer had heard. These included famous real-life conspiracy theories, ones from movies, ones inspired by discussions at their office, and a homeless man who they paid to sweep the driveway. He cited the man and the conspiracies he believed as a particular inspiration for the level. While the level addressed mental illness in a comedic way, Schafer noted that he was not trying to mock people with mental illnesses, and wanted players to empathize with characters like Boyd. Schafer went into it imagining the world as a giant spider-web surrounding Boyd's house, designed to evoke a \\"retro, [19]50s spy vibe\\" in a suburban neighborhood where things were not as they seemed. Art director Scott Campbell wanted paranoia to be a more prominent aspect of the level, which he accomplished by having eyes and binoculars come out of various objects and landmarks whenever players are looking away from them, to create the feeling of being watched. He was also responsible for the G-Men that are found throughout the level, basing them on \\"G-Man detectives\\" from the 1950s, as well as the Spy vs. Spy comics. Campbell specifically reminisced about the amusement he found with how conspicuous the Spy vs. Spy characters were with their outfits and behavior, giving the G-Men in \\"Milkman Conspiracy\\" a single object as a disguise, and making them use it in a blatantly incorrect fashion. Concept artist Peter Chan visualized the world as suburbia being \\"vaulted up against the sky,\\" while the roads twisted in the air. He compared it to Boyd's logic and reason, which he described as twisted. Schafer recruited Erik Robson as lead gameplay designer. Robson was determined to implement adventure-style game play, requiring players to utilize different objects to solve puzzles and blend in with the G-Men. The level grew larger than expected, due in part to the designers' use of gravity tech in the game. Robson felt that the level was too open, feeling that there should be fewer \\"ambient houses.\\" He also wished that Boyd's \\"inner turmoil\\" was better expressed through the level. In discussing the themes of the level, he described its antagonists as \\"an immune system\\" responding to the presence of the Milkman in Boyd's mind, and that the Milkman can be \\"buried\\" but not eliminated, causing Boyd to feel paranoid about something bad happening because of it. He found the open-air maze and the sense of confusion well done, but wished that more was done to \\"drive that emotional point better.\\" He felt it was not a standout level, but appreciated the writing and humor. After the designers and programmers finished with the level, Schafer began writing dialogue around what had been created. He originally wanted Erik Wolpaw to write the dialogue, but because Wolpaw was too busy, he did it himself. He wrote the G-Men's dialogue to be flat and nonsensical while having some thread of truth, and cited the line \\"rhubarb is a controversial pie flavor\\" as an example. He explained that this was based on rhubarb pie being poisonous if prepared incorrectly. Reception Concept artwork of the level by artist Peter Chan \\"Milkman Conspiracy\\" has received generally positive reception, identified as a fan favorite of Psychonauts. Author Daniel Hardcastle identified it as the highlight of Psychonauts, also suggesting that it was one of the best areas in video games. Digital Spy staff similarly regarded it as the best level in the game, a sentiment which PCGamer writer Samuel Horti shared, citing the level's jokes as the most memorable part of it for them and many other players. Bitmob staff found it the best level in Psychonauts, praising its dialogue as among the best-written in video games. Game Revolution writer Ben Silverman found it one of the best platforming levels, praising it for its creativity. GamesRadar+ staff called it brilliant, while GamesRadar+ writer Lucas Sullivan felt that it was unlike any other level in any video game. GamesRadar+ staff also included it on their list of 59 video game levels people should play, calling it a standout among standout levels in the game. They compared the design of the world to a combination of graphic artist M. C. Escher and filmmaker Tim Burton and praised the gameplay concepts employed. Gamasutra writer Jim Rossignol also compared its style to M. C. Escher's. Eurogamer writer Christian Donlan felt that the gameplay was not the standout aspect of the level, claiming that its \\"magic\\" came from how the level was presented and arranged. It has received discussion for its exploration of mental health. The Escapist writer Lara Crigger discussed it in their analysis of Psychonauts exploration of insanity. Crigger talked about how the world's architecture and occupants reflect how Boyd is being watched by people who wish to do harm to him. Fellow The Escapist writer Marty Sliva called it the \\"perfect platforming game level,\\" stating that it was \\"one of the most unforgettable levels in video game history.\\" Sliva discussed how the nature of the level's world made players empathize with Boyd, as well as how the G-Men reflected Boyd's distrust in all of the people around him. Sliva also discussed how the Clairvoyance power is used to give players the opportunity to empathize with Boyd and what he is going through, adding that the \\"tragic events\\" that lead Boyd to be the way he is makes it \\"even more heartbreaking.\\" Author Alice Brumby described the world of Boyd's mind as the \\"most disordered\\" in Psychonauts. They discussed the central area, where Boyd is present, as the most sane place in his mind, suggesting that it represents Boyd's \\"ego\\" due to his presence there. They point out how the twisted nature of the area's roads contrasts with the world of another Psychonauts character, Sasha Nein's level; where that level has no risk of falling, this level there exists a regular risk. According to Brumby, this was due to the \\"disorientingly inconsistent gravity,\\" which they describe as representing a \\"formerly normal, healthy mind, and the difficulty and dangers of exploring it.\\" The Gameological Society writer Joe Keiser called it the \\"first great example of game environment as characterization,\\" discussing how the cameras and G-Men reflect Boyd's feeling of being watched. Keiser also discussed how the Figments' representation of people and things reflects aspects that Boyd likely saw, but took no heed to due to his job as a security guard. He discussed how they are used effectively to convey the \\"vestiges of sanity on the fringes of delusion.\\" Multiple games have been compared to \\"Milkman Conspiracy,\\" including Jazzpunk, We Happy Few, and Super Mario Galaxy.

The central subway comprises several tunnels built at different times, including the Tremont Street subway, the Boylston Street subway, and the Huntington Avenue subway. Boston's subway operator, the MBTA, sometimes also refers to the Red Line and Orange Line heavy rail transit (HRT) tunnels as part of the central subway tunnel. In the early and mid twentieth century, the central subway was also known as the trolley subway, and was used for at least seven different trolley routes and with a variety of equipment. The original vehicles used were early single-unit electric trams with trolley poles to pick up the electric power from an overhead wire, which Boston had a decade of experience with. When the Tremont Street subway opened in 1897, it handled over 280 trolleys per hour and took nearly 200 trolleys per hour off the congested Tremont Street. Frank Sprague introduced electric multiple unit (EMU) trains in Chicago, also in 1897, and those came to Boston a few years later, not in the trolley subway but in the new \\"elevated\\", the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy), which mostly served the West End. By 1901, Boston had the first EMU trains running underground, using some of the tracks and modified platforms of the Tremont Street subway. These heavy-rail lines evolved into the MBTA's Red, Orange, and Blue lines, which shared some of the central subway tunnels and stations with the light-rail Green Line. In 1908, a new Washington Street tunnel was opened, parallel to the Tremont Street subway from Haymarket station to North Station, for the heavy-rail BERy traffic, restoring the Tremont Street subway to light-rail-only operation.

The Canary Islands were first politically unified into a single governance under their rule, though their holdings would fragment and influence would wane over time. Due to their role in the Islands' political history, they are among the oldest recorded family lineages on the Canaries. Overview=Background The Peraza family had previously been based in Seville. The family was initially of minor prominence there with their common ancestor, Bartolomé Ruiz Peraza (ca. 1335-1390), became the city’s senior collector (“recaudador mayor de Sevilla”) in 1370, like his father before him, and was later elevated to a knight. Their status rose further as his daughter, born as Leonor Ruiz de Peraza, married Gonzalo Pérez Martel y Mathe de Luna, the VI Lord of neighboring Almonaster la Real, and born to the powerful Martel and Mathe de Luna families. He was specifically descendant of the line of the French Martel family that first migrated from Carolingian France to Aragon and then to Seville during the Reconquista. Gonzalo Martel also owned rights and interests in the Canary Islands, thanks to a royal grant by King Enrique III of Castile to him in 1390 allowing him to conquer them. Martel would lead a successful expedition in 1393 which returned to the court of Castile with many riches and slaves, laying the foundation for further involvement in the islands by his descendants. Establishment in the Canary Islands The couple’s second son, Hernán/Fernán Peraza Martel (better known as “Hernán Peraza the Elder”) was became the patriarch of the family lineage in the Canaries. It was he that was responsible for forging the direction and execution the strategy to conquer the entirety of the Canary Islands and lay long-term family roots there. This effort took years of maneuvering, from high-level trades to outright forceful conquest. Hernán Peraza the Elder was Lord of Valdeflores, warden of the Castle of Matrera in 1420, as well as Faithful Executor and a Knight veintiquatro of Seville. By 1424 Peraza was married to Inés de las Casas, daughter of Juan de las Casas and descendant of French nobility. During this period Peraza began to become actively involved in the Canary Islands, first by inheriting from his father Gonzalo Martel the royal right to conquest in them. Additionally Peraza received further rights from his wife’s father and uncle, Guillén and Juan de las Casas, who also owned territories there. He first received dominion of the island of Fuerteventura as a dowry by his father-in-law Juan de las Casas in the 1420s. Then Peraza purchased from the Count of Niebla Enrique de Guzmán the islands of El Hierro and Lanzarote in 1430. Finally, he obtained the right to most of the remaining islands in 1445 when he traded with Guillén de las Casas his estate in Huévar in exchange for the rights that Guillén had over the lordship of the islands he inherited from his own father Alfonso: Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma and Gran Canaria. This effectively unified control of most of the Canary Islands under Peraza. Conquest, Consolidation, and the Death of Guillén Peraza Though legally his, Peraza then set about conquering his new territories from their native populations to establish de facto ownership and rule. He then relocated to the islands permanently in 1447 with his son Guillén and three ships. They first took possession of Fuerteventura, where they were initially well received. While Peraza organized his new government of Fuerteventura, he also organized several expeditions to the other islands in search of slaves and valuables with which to pay for the conquest. A ship led by a relative and carrying his son Guillén makes an incursion into La Palma, where the natives defeat the conquerors and Guillén dies. The other two ships, under the command of Basque captain Juan Machín, arrive to El Hierro and capture the daughter of the island king. The death of Guillén Peraza becomes a significant and impactful moment in the history of the Canary Islands politically and culturally. It sparks saddness and outrage among nobles in the Castillian mainland and drove his father Hernán to an increasingly brutal repression of the native people. It also inspired the first work of original Spanish literature to come from the Canary Islands, a dirge poem titled Endechas a la muerte de Guillén Peraza (\\"Laments to the death of Guillén Peraza\\"). His exact date of death was not recorded, however it can be dated between the second half of 1447 and the first quarter of 1448. His body was believed to be found during an excavation in 1980. Peraza would continue to struggle with various native groups as well, as well as the Portuguese (in 1450 and in 1452), but otherwise successfully unified the lordship of the Canary Islands in practice as well as law by the 1450s. In addition to unifying the lordship and establishing the Peraza family in the islands, Hernán the Elder also founded the towns of Valverde and San Sebastián de La Gomera as well as built the historic military structure and landmark now known as “Torre del Conde” - The Tower of the Count. \\"Torre del Conde,\\" the tower constructed by Hernán Peraza The Elder in 1450. Fragmentation of the Peraza Lordship Due to the previous death of his son Guillén, Hernán Peraza the Elder is succeeded by his daughter Inés Peraza following his death in 1552. After inheriting the unified lordship her father built, Inés styled herself the “Queen of the Canary Islands” for over 20 years until the seigneury was permanently splintered. In that time Inés and her husband, Diego de Herrera, however, would struggle with the Crown of Castile as well as the Kingdom of Portugal for their rights over the islands. This resulted in numerous lawsuits that both fragmented the Peraza lordship while also reaffirming and securing their claims to certain portions of it. In 1454 the Peraza-Herrera's received from King Enrique IV of Castile the return of the island of Lanzarote to their lordship by way of a court order confirming their ownership. That same year they successfully removed Henry the Navigator from the part of La Gomera that his vassals were occupying. In 1468 Enrique IV was also forced to revoke his concession of the conquest of the unsubmissive islands he had made in favor of several Portuguese nobles in 1464. Later the Catholic Monarchs had granted Inés and her husband the establishment of a majorat of the islands in 1476, (which later confirmed to their son Hernán Peraza the Younger in 1486). However, following a revolt against the Herrera-Perazas that same year, the islands of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife were then sold to the Catholic Monarchs in 1477, formally ending Inés’ claim as “Queen of the Canary Islands.” As a result of her tumultuous reign, Inés was the last head of the unified seigneury, though the Peraza family would remain a prominent force in the governing and shaping of the Canary Islands through the following century. Third generation With the sale to the Catholic Monarchs, the lordship of the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom was reduced to the islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, La Gomera and El Hierro. However, increased division began in 1474 as a result of the distribution between their children as they came of age. Pedro, their eldest son, received the island of El Hierro on the occasion of his marriage, and in 1478 their second son, Hernán Peraza the Younger (named after Inés’ father) received La Gomera. However in 1482, following Pedro's attempts against the life of his parents as well provoking revolts in the family domain, he was disinherited by Inés, who then favored the second-born Hernán The Younger, giving him control of El Hierro as well. His rule was marked by particularly brutal and despotic repression of the native Canarian groups and he was eventually assassinated by one of their leaders in 1488. In 1502, Inés divided Lanzarote and Fuerteventura into twelfth parts among her other children: Sancho de Herrera, María de Ayala and Constanza Sarmiento - five for Sancho, four for María and three for Constanza. Marriages Another development that improved the prominence of the Peraza family during this period were key marriages that expanded their status for a time, even as their lordship fractured. In the late 1460s Inés’s daughter María de Ayala married Diogo da Silva de Meneses, an influential member of the Portuguese court and future Count of Portalegre. This marriage significantly expanded the Peraza’s diplomatic alliances beyond Castile to include the Kingdom of Portugal, which further strengthened the key position of the Canary Islands throughout the Age of Discovery as it was the final stop for other conquistadors crossing the Atlantic to the New World in the coming years. Additionally, in 1482 Hernán Peraza the Younger entered an arranged marriage with Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio. This was a condition for his forgiveness from the Court of Castile for his role in the death of the Captain Juan Rejón. Peraza had to utilize his family’s influential connections in the court to secure and negotiate the royal forgiveness following the scandal and lawsuits the death caused.https://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/aea/id/1882> Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio was a problematic Lady of the Court who was notorious for her infamous high-profile affairs, including King Ferdinand II and (later) Christopher Columbus, earning her the nickname La Cazadora - “The Huntress.” Queen Isabella I personally arranged the marriage between Peraza and Bobadilla, which proved to be significantly advantageous to the Perazas as it joined them with the Bobadilla family, among the most wealthy and powerful in the Kingdom of Spain at the time. Following Hernán Peraza the Younger's death in La Gomera in 1488, his widow Beatriz would succeed him as territorial Lady and ruler of La Gomera and El Hierro. Bobadilla herself was then succeeded by their son, Guillén Peraza de Ayala, who was elevated from a lord to the title of first Count of La Gomera in 1515 by Queen Joanna and Emperor Carlos V.

His work considers the social and political mechanisms that give rise to inequality in Africa.  Early life and education  Chigudu was born in Zimbabwe. He moved to the United Kingdom He trained in medicine at Newcastle University. After graduating he worked as a doctor in the National Health Service, and became increasingly interested in global health and healthcare equity. He took part in several international placements, including at the Global Fund for Women where he studied sexual health in Sub-Saharan Africa. As part of this position Chigudu worked in rural hospitals in South Africa and coordinated the largest epidemiological survey in Tanzania. On his return he joined Imperial College London as a academic clinical fellow in public health. During his fellowship he earned a Master's in Public Health where he studied the health system in The Gambia. To further his interest in social sciences, Chigudu decided to complete a second master's degree, and moved to the University of Oxford to train in African studies. He was awarded a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholarship to investigate feminist movements in Northern Uganda. Whilst at Oxford he decided to work toward a PhD in the Oxford Department of International Development under the supervision of Jocelyn Alexander. As a graduate student, Chigudu was a founding member of the Oxford Rhodes Must Fall activist group that looked to “decolonise” both Oxford and academia more broadly. He was awarded the African Studies Association Audrey Richards Prize for the best doctoral thesis in African Studies in the United Kingdom.  Research and career  He has investigated the social and political origins and impacts of the 2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. He attributes the spread of this preventable disease to a breakdown of public health infrastructure and diminishing bureaucratic order. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Chigudu became concerned by how Africa would respond to the outbreak of coronavirus disease. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, Chigudu wrote in The Guardian about the need to remember the devastation caused by the British Empire. At one of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Oxford, Chigudu said “The institution is structured according to a legacy and a culture that is very white and very elitist,”. He said that he believed Black Lives Matter had become such a powerful message in Oxford because of their history “of white supremacy that has denigrated, exploited and subjugated black lives”.

As chairperson of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) from 1985 to 1992, she led a reform of its management to create clear duties for all the staff. Tumim worked with the Charity Commission for England and Wales and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) to research attitude and performance in the charity world's wider managerial sector. She was chairperson of the NCVO between 1996 and 2001, writing a report advocating for the reform of charity law, which led the Blair ministry to pass the Charities Act 2006. After Tumim's death. the NCVO created an award in her name to reward an improvement in charity governance. Biography=Family background Tumim's father, Algernon Malcolm Borthwick, was chairperson of the family- owned global meat-importing business, served in the Gordon Highlanders as a lieutenant-colonel in the Second World War, winning the Military Cross, and was unsuccessful in getting elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative Party MP in the 1945 United Kingdom general election. He was married to Edith Wylde (née Addison) and was a descendant of Scottish landowners from Midlothian; Tumim's great-grandfather Thomas Borthwick was appointed a peer but died before the issuing of letters patent in 1915. Tumim was born Winifred Letitia Borthwick at Wethersfield Place, Wethersfield, Braintree, Essex, on 3 June 1936 and grew up at the home. She was educated at North Foreland Lodge School. In 1955, Tumim enrolled at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics and economics. She graduated in 1958. At the college, Tumim met Stephen Tumim, the barrister and future Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, and the couple married on 1 February 1962. They had three daughters; the second was born profoundly deaf and the youngest lost her hearing while she was still an infant.  Career  Knowing two of their daughters were deaf, Tumim and her husband were devoted to learning about deafness and taking actions that would improve their livelihood, in an era where there were controversies over how deaf persons should be educated. In 1974, she became a governor at Mary Hare Grammar School for the Deaf in Newbury and was a member of the Warnock inquiry on the education of handicapped children four years later. In 1979, Tumim earned a diploma in linguistics at School of Oriental and African Studies in London. She stood as a Social Democratic Party parliamentary candidate for the Oxfordshire seat of Wantage in the 1983 United Kingdom general election but lost the election. According to Tumim's obituarist in The Times, the experience of running for office proved to be \\"an important addition to her armoury for later campaigns.\\" From 1985 to 1992, she served as chairperson of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID). Tumim reorganised the management of the RNID to create a clear distinction of responsibilities of her job, the committee and its paid and volunteer staff. Having been attracted by this approach, the Charity Commission for England and Wales and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) invited her to lead a working party to look into the wider managerial sector in the charity world in 1992. Tumim focused mainly on trustees' attitude and performance and learnt two-thirds of interviewees did not know their legal and professional obligations. She called this state of management \\"mad chair disease\\" in a report emphasising the need to improve the appointment and education of trustees. Tumim became chair of the NCVO in 1996 and left in 2001. In the role, she led the NCVO's campaign for reform of charity law, which she and others regarded as considerably out of date by four centuries. Tumim knew of a plethora of resistance to change in the charity and law worlds but concluded a revamp was needed. Her report was sent to the Blair ministry's strategy unit in 2002. which had considered change and agreed. Tumim's recommendations led to the passing of the Charities Act 2006, which introduced a definition of \\"public benefit\\" and revised public collection regulations. She was chair of the Forum on Children and Violence, which was formed after the 1993 Murder of James Bulger to campaign for investigations into what caused violence amongst children. Between 1992 to 1999, Tumim was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, London, and was appointed chair of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy in 2000, in an era where rates of teenage pregnancy in the United Kingdom were reportedly one of the worst in Western Europe. Recognising the need to take a more rational approach to teenage pregnancy, the group produced reports to promote awareness of it the and possible routes to lower the rates. This included Tumim visiting areas with high rates of teenage pregnancies to review the progress of the group's strategy on bettering childcare, education, employment and housing for adolescent parents while developing contraception and information services along with sex education programmes. In December 2001, she was made chair of the Foyer Federation, a charity providing accommodation and support to homeless young persons. Tumim hosted the Sunday luncheons at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the Warden's Lodge, and joined the General Medical Council as an associate member, having been on its disciplinary committee from 1996 to 2003. Starting in 2008, she was the founding chairperson of the National Registers of Communication Professionals Working with Deaf and Deafblind People, became an ambassador for the health and education services charity for young people Brook, served as vice- president of the National Deaf Children's Society, and a member of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations and the Athenaeum Club, London. Personal life In 1992, Tumim was awarded the OBE for her work with the RNID and the CBE in 2003. She suffered a heart attack and died at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on 3 November 2009. On 24 March 2010, a memorial service was held for her at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. Legacy Paul Levy of The Independent wrote Tumim was an effective campaigner through \\"her willingness to challenge authority\\". She is regarded by the media and the charity world as one who played a significant role in the voluntary sector in the prior two decades. In 2010, the NCVO established the Winifred Tumim Memorial Prize for best practice in charity governance, to commemorate her work with the body \\"to improve the quality of charity governance.\\" References Category:1936 births Category:2009 deaths Category:People from Braintree, Essex Category:Alumni of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London Category:20th-century English women Category:21st-century English women Category:English women philanthropists Category:20th-century philanthropists Category:21st-century philanthropists Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Winifred Tumim"},{"id":"64258356","text":"Alexander Parambithara was the speaker of Kerala Legislative Assembly from 13 December 1961 to 10 September 1964.

He is known for his opinions condemning the Turkish nationalist movement under Kemal Atatürk. Due to his resistance to Atatürk, he lived half of his life in exile in various countries, and died in Egypt.  Life  His father was Ahmed Efendi. He was born in Tokat in 1869. He began his education in his hometown, and quickly memorized the Quran. He pursued his education in Kayseri and Constantinople (today Istanbul), where he studied under Ahmed Asim Efendi and received his certificate of proficiency (icazetname). He married the daughter of his master Asım Efendi. He passed the Ruus examination (teaching qualification exam) and became a teacher (müderris) at Fatih mosque. From 1898 until 1914, he attended Huzur lessons (lectures and discussion given by the ulema in the presence of the Sultan). Between 1900 and 1904, he was the librarian (hafiz-i kutub) of Sultan Abdelhamid II (r. 1876–1909). After the re-establishment of the Constitution on July 1908, he entered Parliament as the representative of Tokat. From 1908 to 1912, he was the chief editor of the journal Bayan-ul-Haq (the Exposition of Truth), an intellectual journal published by the Cemiyet-i İlmiye (Religious Scholars’ Association). Although he thanked the CUP (Committee of Union and Progress) and the army in an article in the first issue of Bayan-ul-Haq for ending the Hamidian regime, shortly afterwards he joined the opposition to the party. He became the founding member of the Ahali (People) party in 1910 and the Hürriyet ve İtilaf (Liberal Entente) party in 1911. In 1912, he participated in the foundation of another political organization, the Cemiyet-i İttihad-i Islamiye (Islamic Union Association). In January 1913, after the Bab-i Ali coup, he fled to Egypt and then went to Romania, where he made his living teaching Turkish. After the occupation of Romania by Ottoman troops during the First World War, he was arrested and sent to Turkey, where he was imprisoned in Bilecik. He was exiled for a time to Bursa. After the end of the war, he again entered politics and joined Dar-ul Hikmet-i İslamiye (Islamic University). He became the shaykh al-Islām, but he resigned from this post. In 1919, he was appointed as shaykh al-Islām in the cabinet of Damad Ferid Pasha. Sabri served as the acting Grand Vizier during the absence of Damad Ferid Pasha while he was attending the Paris Peace Conference, and he was nominated to the senate after the fall of Ferid Pasha’s cabinet. He became the first president of the Cemiyet-i Müderrisin (Society of Islamic Scholars), which later became the Teali-i Islam Cemiyeti (Society for the Elevation of Islam). In 1920, Mustafa Sabri was again appointed as shaykh al-Islām to the second cabinet of Damad Ferid. In 1922, he fled Turkey once more to escape arrest by the nationalists when his name appeared on a list of 150 political dissidents. He went to Romania for a second time where he published the journal Yarın (Tomorrow). Sabri first went to Romania and then to Greece, where he published an anti- Kemalist newspaper in which he violently attacked the new Turkish regime and its founder, Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938). He later went to Hejaz, before settling in Egypt, where he continued his intellectual activities. In the early 1930s he went to Egypt, where he stayed until his death on 12 March 1954.  Works  As a conservative scholar, he produced a number of works. In his writings, he opposed both Western secularism and Islamic modernism/reformism, which is affected by Westernization. He proposed a program of Islamization before and after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. He remained within the context of the traditional Ash'arite-Maturidite theology and Ottoman madrasa system. In Egypt, he wrote several books in Arabic in response to such modernist thinkers as Muhammad Farid Wajdi and 'Abbas Mahmud al-'Aqqad as well as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad 'Abduh, and Muhammad Mustafa al-Maraghi. He also criticized the views of some Egyptian intellectuals such as: Qasim Amin, Zaki Mubarak, Zaki Naguib Mahmoud, Muhammed Hussein Heikal, Taha Hussein, and 'Ali 'Abdel Raziq, who remained under the influence of Westernization and interpreted the Islamic religion according to Western thought and values. He responded to the allegations of the Arab historian Muhammad 'Abdullah 'Inan against the Ottoman Turks and refuted his theses. Contrary to being in Christianity, he insisted that Islam was not in conflict with science and it was a religious obligation to cover women according to certain conditions. One of the persons that he debated on scholarly issues was Mahmud Shaltut, who took office in various levels and rose to prominence with his reformist thoughts. He objected the fatwa of Shaltut who used the thesis that there is no open expression in Quran and in Hadith that support the ascension and descent of Prophet Isa in such as extend to form the basis of faith and the person who rejected this belief would not be in trouble with in terms of faith. He criticized Shaltut and he gave answers to his assertions and the evidences he used. Mustafa Sabri criticized Musa Bigiev’s thought and called him the “Luther of Islam.” He also criticized some poets like Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi and Ahmad Shawqi. After the abolition of the Sultanate and the position of shaykh al-Islām in 1922, published his Al- Nakir 'ala Munkiri al-Ni'ma min al-Din wa-al-Khilafa wa-al-Umma () Completed before the abolition decision was made, Sabri's book mentioned the fate of the caliphate very briefly at the conclusion of his work, only as an additional proof for the arguments already advanced in the book. This work is a strong attack on the Kemalists and their evolving vision for post-Ottoman Turkey. Sabri presents the Kemalists as decadents, Turkish chauvinists who colluded with the British against Islam and the caliphate, and Kemal Atatürk as a concealed Jew. Although the caliphate is not the main focus of the book, Sabri defends the last Sultan/Caliph and describes the separation of the Turkish government from the caliphate as a premeditated step on the part of the Kemalists to establish a non-Islamic government in Turkey. In the Mas'alat Tarjamat al-Qur'an (), Mustafa Sabri takes up the issue of using the translation of Qur'anic verses in ritual prayers. The book is a direct response to Atatürk's attempt to have all prayers performed in modern Turkish rather than in their original form in Arabic. His four-volume magnum opus Mawqif al-'Aql wa-al-'Ilm wa-al-'Alim min Rabb al-'Alamin wa-'Ibadihi al- Mursalin () is devoted to a detailed analysis and criticism of many issues of twentieth-century Islamic modernism.

They were most prominent in the mid-to-upper Eocene (~50 to 39 million years ago), although some fossils were found on land in the upper Oligocene (~28 million years ago). Description Helohyidae share vague similarities to present-day pigs, though were slimmer in build. They possessed prominent canines and molars with bunodont cusps, bulging dental wreaths, and wrinkled enamel. Their upper molars were usually squared, due to the enlargement and displacement of the metaconule, but there was also a small hypocone and hypoconule. The paraconule was reduced and there was no mesostyle. Their lower molars increased in size as they proceeded to the bottom of the jaw, and the paraconid was small or absent. Some forms (e.g. Gobiohyus) possessed small diastemas that separated the premolars from each other. The snout was usually elongated (e.g. in Helohyus), but in some forms ascribed to this family (Achaenodon), it was very short. Compared to other primitive artiodactyls such as dichobunids, they possessed higher sagittal ridges; the genus Achaenodon, in particular, possessed a large sagittal crest and its size was much larger than those of other helohyids. Classification The family Helohyidae was established by Marshall in 1877 to accommodate some forms of early artiodactyl mammals of the American Eocene. In addition to the genus Helohyus, the North Americans Dyscritochoerus, Parahyus and Achaenodon were later ascribed to this family. Other forms come from the Upper-Middle-East Eocene of Asia (Gobiohyus of Inner Mongolia, Pakkokuhyus of Burma and Progenitohyus of Thailand. The latter form may be close to the origin of the family of hippo-like anthracotheres. The last known helohyid is Simojovelhyus of The Upper Oligocene of Mexico: the discovery of this form implies the existence of a ghost lineage of helohyids of about 10 million years.Ferrusquea-Villafranca, 2006 Helohyids have been variously classified as relatives of archaic dichobunids or as close to the origin of anthracotheres. The current opinion is to classify them as relatives of the dichobunids.McKenna and Bell, 1997; Stucky, 1998; Rose, 2006 References Category:Prehistoric mammal families Category:Even-toed ungulates ","title":"Helohyidae"},{"id":"64258547","text":"Kehrsatz Nord railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Kehrsatz, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

It lived in the Mid-To-Upper Eocene (about 43-39 million years ago) and its fossil remains have been found in North America. Description This animal was large and looked vaguely like a wild boar, but the size of an American black bear (Ursus americanus): it was about two meters long and weighed about 285 kilograms. Achaenodon's snout was very short and sturdy, with large sideways expanded zygomatic arches, making the skull extremely wide. There was a very high sagittal crest, which connected later to an expanded nuchal crest; these two structures, together with the large cheekbone arches, indicate that the musculature of the jaws was extremely powerful. Achaenodons teeth were characterized by large curved canines and large post-dumping teeth with a bunodont structure. The dental formula was typical of the artiodactyls with three incisors, a canine, four premolars and three molars; the first lower premolar was present in young people and, growing up, was expelled due to the growth of the canine. The upper molars were square in shape and equipped with four large conical cusps, surrounded by sturdy precing and postcingulation and extraordinarily thickened enamel. One particular species (A. frendi) still possessed protoconule and hypoconus, which disappeared in the other achenodonts. 'Achaenodons front legs were short and the hand had four fingers. The hind legs were slightly longer. Classification First described in 1893 by Edward Drinker Cope, Achaenodon is best known for fossil remains from the Wyoming Middle Eocene. The type species is Achaenodon insolens, but other species (A. robustus, A. uintense, A. frendi) are also known, from California, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. The affinities of Achaenodon are unclear: for a long time this animal has been classified among the entelodontids, the so- called \\"terror pigs\\" typical of the Oligocene and Miocene; this classification was mainly due to the large size of Achaenodon and the similarities in the particularly massive teeth. In fact, the similarities between Achaenodon and entelodonts were mainly due to evolutionary convergence and the development of characteristics due to the large size It is likely, however, that Achaenodon was a highly specialized representative of the heloiids (Helohyidae), a group of primitive artiodactyls typical of the North American and Asian Eocene, usually much smaller in size. Achaenodon, if it had actually been a giant eloiid, would also have been the last representative of the family (except the Mexican Simojovelhyus, dating back to the Upper Oligocene). An animal closely related to Achaenodon is Parahyus, of smaller size. Other studies have indicated that Achaenodon could be a baseline representative of the Cetancodontamorpha group. Paleoecology The large size of Achaenodon made it a difficult target for middle Eocene carnivores. Achaenodon was the first large artiodactyl, and remained the only artiodactyl to be part of the megafauna throughout the Eocene; even after the disappearance of this animal, there were no other large artiodactyls for at least 5 million years, with the appearance of Archaeotherium.

This is used in object manipulation planning, and with the addition of sensors built into the manipulation system, can be used to produce a surface map or contact model of the object being grasped.  In Robotics  For a robot to autonomously grasp an object, it is necessary for the robot to have an understanding of its own construction and movement capabilities (described through the math of inverse kinematics), and an understanding of the object to be grasped. The relationship between these two is described through a contact model, which is a set of the potential points of contact between the robot and the object being grasped. This, in turn, is used to create a more concrete mathematical representation of the grasp to be attempted, which can then be computed through path planning techniques and executed.  In Mathematics  Depending on the complexity of the end effector, or through usage of external sensors such as a Lidar or Depth camera, a more complex model of the planes involved in the object being grasped can be produced. In particular, sensors embedded in the fingertips of an end effector have been demonstrated to be an effective approach for producing a surface map from a given contact region. Through knowledge of the robot's position of each individual finger, the location of the sensors in each finger, and the amount of force being exerted by the object onto each sensor, points of contact can be calculated. These points of contact can then be turned into a three-dimensional ellipsis, producing a surface map of the object. Applications In hand manipulation is a typical use case. A robot hand interacts with static and deformable objects, described with soft-body dynamics. Sometimes, additional tools has to be controlled by the robot hand for example a screwdriver. Such interaction produces a complex situation in which the robot hand has similar contact points with the tool. Apart from robotics control, tactile models are calculated in virtual environments. If a human operator touches with a data glove on an object, he produces a heatmap on the contact points with the object. This surface can be displayed in realtime and allows a better understanding of motion models.

He is also the chairman of OFK Grbalj, which plays in the Montenegrin First League.  Biography = Early life  He was born on 5 April 1966 in Kotor to a Serb family. He finished middle and high school in Kotor, and later graduated from the Faculty of Economics in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Business career  For over 30 years, he has been involved in business and gained a fortune in the construction business. Until recently, he was the director of the \\"Carinvest\\" construction company. Carević is a millionaire. He is also the chairman of OFK Grbalj, which finished 6th in the 2018–2019 Montenegrin First League season.  Political career  He is a member of the New Serb Democracy which is a part of the Democratic Front (DF). Following the October 2016 local elections, the DF and the Democrats managed to form a local government in Budva, replacing the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) after 25 years in power, against which several corruption proceedings were conducted during the previous term. DF and the Democrats agreed to form a local coalition government, with would see head of the local Democrats Dragan Krapović and Carević serve as Mayor of Budva in a rotation deal for 2 years each. Carević has been serving as the Mayor of Budva since 9 January 2019 with his local government under dispute since 17 June 2020. He refused his mayor salary and has been donating his salary money to the people in need. Carević was part of 2019-2020 clerical protests in Montenegro, also one of organizers of many protest walks in his hometown of Budva, at the height of the political crisis and an open conflict between DPS-led government and the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro. On 11 June 2020, members of the Budva local parliament from the Democratic Party of Socialists, the Montenegrin, and an independent, Stevan Džaković, elected from the 2016 Democratic Front electoral list, have voted to remove Carević from office, however he remained in office, as he claimed that the session was illegal and that he can only be removed from office at the elections, accusing Džaković of betraying the electoral will of voters, as well for political corruption. On 17 June 2020, Special Anti-Terrorist Unit stormed the building of the Municipality of Budva to remove Carević from office. However, Carević resisted and the police arrested him, as well as the President of Assembly of Budva, Krsto Radović (from the Democrats), 4 other members of Democratic Front and the Democrats, as well Carević's brother and his son. Carević was taken to the hospital after getting injured during the arrest, and has left the hospital with a cast on his foot. Police have also blocked the entrance to the city. Vladimir Bulatović (from the Montenegrin) was voted for the acting Mayor of Budva by the new parliamentary majority. The next day, Carević and Radović returned to their offices and they said that the \\"coup\\" failed. The decision of the new parliamentary majority on the removal of Carević and Radović and the election of Bulatović and Kuč as acting officials was not recorded in the archives of the Budva parliament because there was no official seal, which Carević said was \\"in its place, with the elected representative of the people.\\" On 23 June 2020 the new majority in the local parliament elected new Mayor from the DPS, as well representatives of the Budva local government, without the presence of opposition MPs and the media, who were denied access to the session by private security and local police forces, which was accompanied by arrests, police brutality and violence against removed local government officials, parliament deputies and its supporters, as well the return of the DPS to local government in Budva, few months priror the regular local elections. Later that day, Prime Minister Dusko Markovic (DPS) labeled Carević an \\"unauthorized person blocking institutions\\", announcing police intervention in Budva, saying \\"the situation will be resolved in 15 minutes\\". On 24 June, after police prevented Carević and the other removed opposition-led local authorities from entering the municipal building, and after the entire old local administration was arrested for resisting, there were major riots and clashes between Police Special Unit and protesters supporting Carević and his administration. The police responded violently towards the peaceful protesters, with several police crackdowns taking place, resulting in beatings and arrests, with numerous cases of police abuse of office, brutality and violence against protesting citizens and political activists were reported.Tokom haosa u Budvi: Policajci tukli preko mjere?, Vijesti After the convincing victory of his list at the local elections in Budva on 30 August 2020, Marko Carević remains the mayor of Budva, once again disempowering the disputed DPS-led local government in Budva.CAREVIĆ PROGLASIO POBEDU: Budva slavi!, Novosti  Personal life  He is married, and has two sons and a daughter.

Author of the 2017 book The Unprecedented 2016 Presidential Election on the election of Donald Trump, her research interests include political and election analysis.  Early life and career  Bitecofer received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Oregon and a Ph.D. in political science and international affairs from the University of Georgia. In 2015 she became a lecturer at CNU, teaching four classes a term. She applied to convert her position to tenure track, which would lighten her teaching responsibilities, but was denied by the university. As a result, she announced her intent to leave CNU in the summer of 2020 to devote more time to her freelance and journalism work.  Election analysis and prediction  In 2017, Bitecofer released a book called The Unprecedented 2016 Presidential Election, where she argued that the election of Donald Trump was not the result of one or two causes, but rather the product of a long process that began in the 1950s. She noted several breaks from past political reporting in the media's coverage of Trump, such as the number of days where Trump received 60% or more of all candidate coverage and his paucity of newspaper endorsements. She later criticized the media and public for characterizing Trump's 2016 performance in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin as a \\"mythic legend of invincibility\\"; instead, she attributed the 2016 result to complacency, depressed African-American turnout, Russian interference, and dislike of Hillary Clinton. Bitecofer was nationally recognized for predicting the results of the 2018 United States midterm elections more closely than most other forecasters. She first predicted that Democrats would pick up 42 seats in the House of Representatives in September 2018, revising her forecast to 45 seats in November, just days before the election even as others were revising their estimates downwards. Democrats ultimately gained 41 seats in the House election, making her prediction one of the most accurate of that cycle. However, there were some errors in her Senate election forecast, where she incorrectly predicted that Democrat Bill Nelson would win reelection in Florida. Following the work of Alan Abramowitz, Bitecofer's main thesis is that modern elections are not decided by the swing vote, but rather negative partisanship, which prioritizes defeating the other side over any specific policy objective. Under this theory, shifts in voter turnout decide everything, and the \\"swing\\" mainly comes from whether voters decide to vote at all rather than deciding who to vote for. This view has been criticized by traditional political analysts like David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report, with others such as Kyle Kondik and Sam Wang taking a more balanced approach. Bitecofer has disagreed with Nate Silver's take that ideologically extreme candidates pay a political price, believing instead that a candidate like Bernie Sanders would not cause significant downside for the Democrats, though she does not find much upside either, arguing that he did not bring many new voters to the polls in 2016. The fact that progressive favorites like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke often came much closer to winning their races in red states in 2018 than Blue Dog moderates who tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump has been held as validation for her theory. In July 2019, Bitecofer predicted that President Trump would lose the 2020 election, with the Democratic candidate winning 278 electoral votes. During the 2020 Democratic primaries, she attributed the increased turnout and Joe Biden's success in the primary process to the eagerness of Democrats and Democratic- leaning independents (and in particular, Black voters) to remove Trump from office.

Her research typically is based on actinide chemistry and luminescence spectroscopy, though some of her published research has extended to lanthanide chemistry, transition metal complexes and organic chemistry.  Education  Natrajan completed her MChem in 1999 at University of York. Upon graduation, she read her Doctor of Philosophy degree at University of Nottingham with Prof. Polly Arnold on Lanthanide and Group (IV) (OSO) binaphtolates : synthesis and catalysis and successfully gained her PhD in 2003.  Research and career  Upon completing her PhD, Natrajan completed her postdoctoral research from 2003 - 2004 with Prof. Marinella Mazzanti at CEA Grenoble in France. She was then appointed as a Leverhulme Trust funded postdoctoral research assistant with Prof. Stephen Faulkner at the University of Manchester from 2005 to 2008 and was an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Career Acceleration Fellow from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, she was promoted to the position of Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester. Natrajan's research is generally based on actinide chemistry and luminescence spectroscopy, though some of her published research has extended to lanthanide chemistry, transition metal complexes and organic chemistry. Apart from research and lecturing, Natrajan and her team also actively participates in outreach activities including in Science Spectacular (2018), Pint of Science (2018), and Soapbox Science (2016). She also engages in work related to promotion and development of women in STEM. Natrajan is also the co-organizer of the 10th International Conference on Nuclear and Radiochemistry which will be held in August 2024.  Notable work  Dr. Natrajan has conducted several research on understanding of the chemistry of actinide ions in unusual oxidation state and also in radiochemistry, where she has developed new methods such as new optical imaging techniques to measure and probe radioelements. In 2020, Dr. Natrajan participated in a research which showed how U(VI) undergoes microbial reduction to form U(IV) and U(VI) via disproportion of U(V). This was the first time the mechanism for this process was significantly researched, and the study showed that the microbial reduction occurs via a single electron transfer to U(VI) by the model Fe(III)-reducing bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR1, to form U(V) and thereby lead to the disproportionation. This research aids in the understanding of possible methods of reducing uranium mobility in contaminated environments. Dr. Natrajan has also contributed to Organometallic Chemistry (Volume 42) where she discussed the use of near infra-red light in both multiphoton and upconversion processes as an alternative technique to luminescence spectroscopy in order to measure the excitation and optical properties of lanthanide(III) complexes. Dr. Natrajan took part in organizing the Newton Bhabha Researcher Links Workshop along with Prof. Prasun Mandal which was held on 14 to 17 December 2017. The workshop was aimed to bring together young and eminent scientific researchers from the UK and Indian institutes towards building international connections and thereby improving the quality of their research, and the three day workshop was concluded successfully, with 15 fully-funded participants from all over the UK taking part.

Born in San Miguel de Tucumán, she grew up surrounded by both classical European music and the folk music of indigenous people living in the area. From a young age she studied piano and in her teens began a band with her brother that explored folk music, jazz, and blues. She published various works of poetry throughout her life. Though she began her university studies at the National University of Tucumán as an English major, after one year she changed course and began to study philosophy and education, eventually graduating in 1948. Her schooling was interrupted by a foray into the study of music both at the Academy of Fine Art and in independent research among those who performed traditional folk music. Upon graduation, Valladares taught briefly before moving to Paris and forming a music duo with María Elena Walsh in the early 1950s. They sang traditional Argentine folk music for four years in cafés and cabarets. The two then returned to Argentina after the 1956 Liberating Revolution had removed Juan Perón from office. There was not a large appreciation for folk music in Argentina at the time and though they continued to perform and release albums, their audiences were limited. The two women split up in 1962 and Valladares embarked on a career of documenting the folk music traditions of Argentina. Her work between 1960 and 1974 produced a documentary series, Mapa musical de la argentina (Musical Map of Argentina), which recorded and preserved folk music throughout varied regions of the country. From the early 1970s, Valladares built bridges with popular musicians from other venues, like rock, in an effort to stop the commercialization of music. When the Argentine dictatorship ended, she joined the Movement for the Reconstruction and Development of National Culture and worked with other musicians to present and preserve the musical heritage of the country. Her last large work América en Cueros (America in Leather, 1992) presented more than 400 folk songs from throughout the Americas and earned her recognition as a member of honor of UNESCO. She was recognized with a Konex Award in 1984, 1994, and 2005, and was the first recipient of the National Prize for Ethnology and Folklore, given in 1996. Early life and influences Leda Nery Valladares Frías was born on 21 December 1919 in San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina, to Aurora Frías and Fermín Valladares. Her mother's ancestry came from the patrician family of Santiago del Estero Province and included and his son, . Her father was a writer, who published two books and was an amateur singer and poet. As Tucumán was a border region, in addition to European classical music, Valladares was exposed to the folk music of the indigenous peoples living in the Calchaquí Valleys. Both of her parents liked singing and often hosted musical evenings. From a young age, Valladares studied piano, initially with Sarah Carreras. Valladares and her brother, , began studying jazz and blues music. As teenagers, they formed a group called Fijos (Folkloric, Intuitive, Jazz, Original, and Surreal) made up of Adolfo Abalos, Manuel Gómez Carrillo, Gustavo \\"Cuchi\\" Leguizamón, Enrique \\"Mono\\" Villegas, Rodrigo Montero, and Lucía Claudia Bolognini Míguez, later known as Lois Blue. Valladares performed under the pseudonym Ann Kay. From well-to-do families, by performing together they sought to rebel against elite musical tastes. Valladares enrolled in the first class of the newly created National University of Tucumán in 1939, as an English major. After one year, she changed her area of study to philosophy and pedagogy. Valladares voraciously read European literature, focusing on French and Spanish symbolism and surrealism. She was also interested in avant-garde poetry and studied German philosophers, including Franz Brentano, Immanuel Kant, and Oswald Spengler. Career=Poetry and later education (1940–1950) l-r: Walsh and Valladares, 1956 Valladares began publishing poems in regional magazines like El mar (The Sea) in 1940 and the following year in La pirámide (The Pyramid). She presented seven poems in the inaugural issue of Cántico (1940), continuing to publish books of poetry throughout her life. She became friends with Olga Orozco and met Alejandra Pizarnik through that association. In 1941, while attending Carnival festivities in Cafayate, she first encountered , the folkloric style of music from the Province of Salta. She decided to leave her philosophy studies and in 1943 attended classes at the Academia de Bellas Artes de la Provincia (Academy of Fine Arts of the Province). She learned to play the clarinet and also sang in a women's quartet specializing in Renaissance music. After a year, she quit, because she did not feel able to express herself in the curriculum's classical styles. She embarked on a journey and paid her own way to study the traditional music of La Rioja Province, San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, and San Salvador de Jujuy. On successfully completing her studies in philosophy and education in 1948, Valladares traveled to Europe with her mother and a friend, Nelly García Alvarez. On their return journey, when their ship docked at Bahia, she watched a Macumba ceremony and saw a commonality in the drumming rhythms with the purity of the music of baguala. She interrupted her trip home and instead went to Caracas to study Afro-Venezuelan music. Upon her return to Tucumán, Valladares read the book of poems, Otoño Imperdonable (Unforgivable Autumn) and began a correspondence with the author, María Elena Walsh. Valladares accepted a position and began teaching in Costa Rica in 1950. Deciding to move together to Paris, she traveled to Panama in 1952, where Walsh met her to complete their journey. During the two months they spent aboard the ship, Valladares taught Walsh, who did not have a musical background, the folk songs and rhythms she knew. Partnership with María Elena Walsh (1952–1962) Leda y María, from the album cover of \\"Entre valles y quebradas\\", 1957 Arriving in Paris, Valladares and Walsh, established a gathering place in their apartment and put together a repertoire which included various folk music styles from Argentina. The two women formed a duet, Leda y María (Leda and Maria) and began performing music based on traditional bagualas, chacareras, , and zambas. They sang in the auditorium of the Sorbonne, in intellectual cafés like l'Écluse, and in cabarets like the Crazy Horse. They selected places frequented by Spanish exiles, who had fled from the Spanish Civil War, and other Europeans, as many Argentines in France felt that they were making their country look unsophisticated by their focus on folk music. They performed for celebrities including Charlie Chaplin and Pablo Picasso, and for José Luis Cano and his circle of friends. Though neither publicly disclosed that they were lovers given the era, their lesbian partnership was known and would later be acknowledged by Walsh. The duo began recording albums; the first Chants d'Argentine (Songs of Argentina) was released in 1954. A year later, they recorded Sous le ciel de l'Argentine (Under the Sky of Argentina). They also made a test recording for Folkways Records in 1955. Though Alan Lomax acknowledged the quality of their music, he refused to produce it, because as members of the upper classes, their songs were not authentic. In 1956, after the coup d'état removed Juan Perón from office, Valladares and Walsh decided to return to Argentina. Almost immediately, they scheduled a lecture, El folklore como tarea poética (Folklore as a Poetic Task), accompanied by some of their songs at the Caja Popular de Ahorros in Tucumán. Having experienced a celebration of Argentine folk songs in Paris, they recognized that there was not the same appreciation in their homeland. Until they broke up as a couple in 1962, after the Tucumán presentation, their performances were limited to intellectual venues. Ethnography, musicology (1959–1999) Valladares performing in 1970 In 1959, Valladares received a scholarship from the National Endowment of the Arts to collect folk music and map the locations of Argentine musical heritage. She bought a recorder and began traveling to collect music from various provinces. The result of these collections was a documentary series released from 1960 to 1974 as the Mapa musical de la argentina (Musical Map of Argentina), directed by Litto Nebbia on Melopea Records. In 1966, she was approached by Jorge Prelorán, a documentary filmmaker, to advise him and Augusto Raúl Cortazar, a folklorist, on the musical portion of their film Relevamiento cinematográfico de expresiones folklóricas argentinas (Cinematographic Survey of Argentine Folkloric Expressions). Their collaboration produced a series of short films, including Hermógenes Cayo and Valle Fértil, which were jointly produced with the National University of Tucumán. In 1969, Valladares began performing as a soloist at educational institutions using a traditional two-sided hand drum, known as the caja coplera (often simply called caja). She recruited groups of students to join her in her music making. At one point in the 1970s, she had over 30,000 students participating with her. Dressed in a poncho, she became a symbol of a countercultural movement against the commercialization of music and away from its spiritual roots, bringing her into contact with both rock and classical musicians. She assisted Anastasio Quiroga in creating the album Pastor de cabras, which led to a collaboration in their production of Folklore de rancho y rascacielos (Folklore of the Ranch and Skyscraper) at the Teatro General San Martín of Buenos Ares, with Susana Lago and José Luis Castiñeira in 1971. This led to a collaboration with Lago and her quartet Cabrakán, which included Beatriz Arágor, Roberto Catarineau, and Jorge Fernández and later in a performance in 1972 at Tucumán with Lago, Quiroga and Henry Nelson. Around 1974, she began a collaboration with Arco Iris, led by Gustavo Santaolalla, and with the Chilean band Los Jaivas. Leda Valladares and musicians who accompanied her for her album \\"Grito en el cielo\\" (1989): León Gieco, Raúl Carnota, Pedro Aznar, Fito Páez, Suna Rocha and Liliana Herrero. With the end of the Argentine dictatorship and a return to democratic rule in the early 1980s, Valladares joined other musicians in the Movement for the Reconstruction and Development of National Culture. They brought together well-known singers for a series of festivals to celebrate the musical heritage of Argentina. Following her earlier map of music, in 1985 she collaborated with León Gieco and Santaolalla in their production of De Ushuaia a La Quiaca (From Usuahia to La Quiaca). Valladares was honored three times with the Konex Award, in 1984, 1994, and 2005. Her last major work, América en Cueros (Latin America in Leather, 1992) brought together more than 400 folk songs from throughout the Americas. It was recognized by Unesco, which designated her as a \\"member of honor\\". For her work in mapping Argentina's musical heritage, Valladares was honored as the inaugural recipient of the National Prize for Ethnology and Folklore in 1996. Valladares retired from public life in 1999 because of complications of Alzheimer's disease. Death and legacy Valladares died on 13 July 2012 in Buenos Aires. In 2019, celebrations for the centennial of her birth were held throughout Argentina and the Día Nacional del Canto con Caja (National Day of Singing with a Hand Drum) was proposed to honor her work in preserving the folk traditions of Argentina. She is revered as a significant figure in influencing the development of many Argentine musicians and for her preservation of Argetina's cultural and musical heritage.

History= Formation of Committee  In 1932, a committee was formed to explore the idea of erecting a statue of Christopher Columbus in Newport as a gift from all the people of Italian heritage in the community. It appears that this committee grew out of the Italian Brotherhood Benefit Society of Newport, which had been incorporated by the General Assembly by an act passed on Feb. 5, 1897. The statue was to be erected to commemorate the contributions made by the Italian explorer. Donations were solicited from people of Italian heritage, but because of the economic crisis of the 1930s and the unstable international situation into the 1940s, the committee’s activities were suspended until a more opportune time. The money that had been collected was put into a savings account and then invested in U.S. Defense Bonds in the name of the committee. Early in the 1950s, the plan was reactivated, and each of the three United Italian Societies was asked to select four members each to serve on the Columbus Monument Committee. By that time, the Sons of Italy, Lodge Progresso e Civilita No. 391 (founded in 1941), later called the Forum Lodge Sons of Italy No. 391, and the Sons of Italy, St. Catherine of Siena Lodge, had joined the Italian Brotherhood Benefit Society in the endeavor. The monument committee announced its plans at a meeting at the end of January 1953 after working quietly for several years. At some point, this committee commissioned the world-renowned Fonderia Artistica Ferdinando Marinelli in Florence, Italy, to create the statue. Marinelli was the cousin of Pasquale Russo, father of Gabriel D. Russo, and Donato F. D’Andrea, who was president of the Italian Brotherhood Benefit Society. Marinelli, born in 1887 near Perugia, established his own foundry in Florence in 1905. His foundry specialized in bronzes by contemporary sculptors as well as meeting the high demand for art-quality replicas of ancient and Renaissance masterpieces. The original was sculpted by Giovanni Cappelletti. The foundry was unable to provide records of the transaction because it had lost all of its records of previous works during the Florence flood of 1966. When the statue was actually ordered is unknown; however, in January 1953, the monument committee received a scale model of the Columbus statue. A photograph in The Newport Daily News on Jan. 30, 1953, shows Gabriel D. Russo with the model. It remains in the family today. The committee also discussed various locations for the statue’s placement and decided on its present location at the intersection of Memorial Boulevard and Bellevue Avenue.  Creation of statue  The statue in 2017 What the foundry wrought was a 5-foot, 8-inch life-size likeness of the explorer in bronze weighing 700 pounds, a sculptured bronze fence with relief panels of crosses and panels depicting Columbus’ ships, the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, as well as a panel showing him greeting the Indians upon his arrival, also weighing 700 pounds. The work also included a 1,300-pound base consisting of four marble outer wall slabs, one with an inscription, “Christopher Columbus, Discoverer of America, October 12, 1492, Erected by the Italian community of Newport, Rhode Island, October 12, 1953,” and a top slab to be assembled here. The name of the artist who created the prototype is on the statue; it reads “Modello (model or prototype), G. Cappelletti.” At that time in 1953, the destroyer tender USS Cascade (AD-16) was on a four-month duty in the Mediterranean to support destroyers there; she was there from Feb. 21, 1953, to June 10, 1953. She had been recommissioned on April 5, 1951, and was based in Newport as tender for the many destroyers that were homeported here. While in the Mediterranean, the Cascade also distributed clothing that had been donated by Newport residents to the needy. The Columbus Monument Committee asked the Navy for its assistance. Through the office of Adm. William Fechtler, chief of naval operations, the Navy agreed to transport the statue and its accessories aboard the Cascade to Newport. The three local Italian societies incurred all expenses for the transport. The Florentine foundry shipped seven crates holding the statue, base and fence to Livorno, Italy, a port city on the Liguria Sea southeast of Genoa, and sent word to the Cascade in La Spezia, Italy, about 75 miles from Livorno. The commanding officer, Capt. Rob Roy McGregor, thought it would be easier to bring the statue to La Spezia than for the ship to go to Livorno, so the statue was brought to La Spezia. On the day of departure, there was a four-hour delay because Italian customs refused to load the statue crates because they did not have the proper clearance. On June 19, 1953, Gabriel D. Russo was notified that the statue would arrive at Melville two days later. That day, Russo, his father, Pasquale, Gabe’s two sons Paul, 10, and Bryan, 5, Donato F. D’Andrea, Enrico Cassese, Michael DeRensis, Mrs. Augustin Bucci and truck driver Stephen Toppa witnessed the unloading of the crates. Following the unloading, the two young boys were taken on a tour of the Cascade. Initially, the crates were taken to the MCM truck warehouse on Chapel Street. Later, the crates were moved to Alfredo Sciarotta, silversmith and metalworker, for assembly. On Columbus Day 1953, the statute was finally installed.  Damage and restoration  In 1958, an auto accident seriously damaged the bronze fence, and it was placed into storage, where it was lost for many years. In 2004 the city of Newport asked Newmans Ltd to restore the bronze statue of Columbus, which had been missing the fencing/surround for nearly years. Fortunately, Mayor Richard Sardella located the surround’s fragments in the back of a construction company’s storehouse under an old fire escape covered with years of dirt. Using historical images kept by a member of the Italian American Society, the restoration company repaired or replaced the missing stone and bronze parts and reassembled the surround. The City of Newport’s Parks Department helped to replace the surround, and strategically placed bollards between the monuments and the oncoming traffic. Since then, the bollards have had to be replaced twice. The statue and its surround remain unscathed.  Controversy  In 2020, Newport Mayor Jamie Bova indicated that she would be \\"very open\\" to removing the statue, noting that there are better Italians to celebrate.

At the time, the majority of white residents in the city identified as Italian American, and as with most Columbus monuments, felt the statue represented their community. It commemorated the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage in 1492. This monument is one of two in the city conceived in recognition of Italian Americans.  Description  The monument stands in a fenced-off flower garden, forming the center of Unico Park on the Newburgh Waterfront. At the time of its construction, development on the waterfront was steadily beginning. UNICO commissioned the statue from Pompeian Studios of Bronxville; it was shipped there from their foundry at Villa Ilice in the Italian city of Carrara. The statue points an outstretched arm towards the Atlantic Ocean, with a small bundle of rope and anchor at its feet. History= Vandalism  During Columbus Day week in 2018, the statue's hands were painted red, and on its base the word \\"HISTORY\\" was spray painted. The UNICO chapter was notified, as were the police. Following the removal of statues as part of George Floyd protests, Newburghers have started a petition to the city council asking for the statue's replacement.

He graduated in 1887, ranked 55th in a class of 64. Start of career Witenmyer was commissioned a second lieutenant of Infantry and assigned to the 9th Infantry Regiment. He was posted to San Diego Barracks, California, where he remained until 1891. In 1892, he was posted to Fort Wingate, New Mexico. In 1893, he was on duty at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Wittenmyer was a student at the Infantry and Cavalry School from 1893 to 1895, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1894. He then served with the 15th Infantry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois and Fort Bayard, New Mexico. While at Fort Bayard he served first as regimental quartermaster, and then as regimental adjutant. During the Spanish–American War, he was first posted to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, where his regiment conducted security patrols on the Mexico–United States border. In November 1898, he was in Huntsville, Alabama with his regiment awaiting transport to Cuba. In January 1899, he was assigned to duty in Puerto Principe. In March, 1899 he was promoted to captain. In July 1899, Wittenmyer returned to the United States with the 15th Infantry. Again assigned as regimental adjutant, Wittenmyer was with the 15th Infantry in the autumn of 1899, when it participated in the China Relief Expedition. When the Army organized forces in China into brigades, Wittenmyer was appointed adjutant of the Second Brigade. He was then appointed to command of Company D, 15th Infantry, which was assigned to Legaspi, Cagdianao during the Philippine–American War. He participated in several expeditions against Filipino insurgents until February 1902, when he was assigned to temporary paymaster duty in Manila. He returned to the United States in April 1903 and performed paymaster duties in the Washington, D.C. office of the Paymaster General. Continued career In March 1906, Wittenmyer was assigned to the 5th Infantry at Plattsburgh Barracks, New York. In October 1906, his regiment deployed as part of the Army of Cuban Pacification during the Second Occupation of Cuba, and he served there until 1908. Upon returning to the United States, Wittenmyer was assigned as the 5th Infantry's adjutant, a post he held until January 1910. Wittenmyer served on the Army General Staff from January 1910 to March 1911. In February 1911, he was promoted to major. In April 1911, he was a member of an Army board that considered locations for Army and National Guard training sites. After serving on the War College staff, Wittenmyer was assigned to the 27th Infantry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. In February 1913, he was with the 27th Infantry when it was posted to Texas City, Texas for border security during the Mexican Revolution. In July 1913, Wittenmyer was assigned as U.S. military attaché in Havana, Cuba and military advisor to the president of Cuba. He remained in this post until the summer of 1917, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1916 and colonel in May 1917. World War I In August 1917, Wittenmyer was promoted to temporary brigadier general for World War I and assigned to command of the 153rd Infantry Brigade, a unit of the 77th Division. The brigade served in France beginning in April 1918, including completing its training in the Calais Sector before relieving the 42nd Division on the front lines of the Baccarat Sector in June 1918. On August 3, 1918, Wittenmyer's brigade transferred to the Vesle Sector with the 77th Division, where it remained until August 13, when it took part in offensive operations to cross the Vesle River and advance to the Aisne River. The 77th Division then marched to the Argonne Sector, where it occupied defensive positions until September 25, when it took part in the Meuse–Argonne offensive. Wittenmyer was promoted to major general with an effective date of October 1, 1918. The 153rd Brigade remained on the offensive until October 15, including the capture of Saint-Juvin from the Germans. On October 24, Wittenmyer assumed command of the 7th Division, which took part in the final offensive of the war as part of Second United States Army. After the armistice ended the war, Wittenmyer remained in command of the 7th Division as it occupied positions near Toul, France. For his World War I service, Wittenmyer received the Army Distinguished Service Medal. In addition, he was awarded France's Legion of Honor (Commander) and Croix de Guerre with Palm. Post-World War I Wittenmyer took part in the post-war occupation of Germany. He remained in command of the 7th Division, except for brief periods of leave, until it returned to the United States. The 7th Division was demobilized on June 20, 1919. After the war, Wittenmyer was reduced to his permanent rank of colonel and assigned as chief of staff for the Ninth Corps Area. In 1922, he was promoted to permanent brigadier general and assigned as commander of Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming. He remained in command until he retired in August 1923. Retirement and death Wittenmyer never married, and had no children. In retirement, he lived with a sister in law and her family near Peebles, Ohio and operated a farm in nearby Lawshe, Meigs Township. In 1930, Congress enacted legislation allowing general officers from World War I to retire at the highest rank they had held, and Wittenmyer was promoted to major general on the retired list. In 1936, Wittenmyer became ill after an auto accident, and sought treatment at the military hospital in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He was diagnosed with cancer, and his left arm was amputated in an effort to halt the spread. Wittenmyer's health did not improve after the amputation, and he died at Walter Reed Hospital on July 5, 1937. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Distinguished Service Medal citation The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Major General Edmund Wittenmyer, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. General Wittenmyer served with marked distinction as Brigade Commander in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, and as Division Commander in the final operations in the Toul sector, and in both capacities, by his untiring efforts and breadth of vision, proved himself to be an able leader.

Beginning in 2015, Vail was involved in several conflicts with other YouTubers which lead to allegations of cyberbullying. Vail was banned by YouTube in 2020, citing repeated violations of their harassment policies.  Career  Vail started his channel in 2011, and uploaded his first video in 2013. He focuses mainly on commentary and Let's Plays. His videos often include him talking over gameplay footage of video games including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Superhot. He had amassed 4.8 million subscribers before he slowed his uploading schedule down and went on a hiatus in December 2017. According to Bryan Menegus of Gizmodo, Vail mocked a man in 2016 with a learning disability, and had earlier made fun of an autistic man known as TommyNC2010, after which YouTube and Reddit communities rallied behind Tommy, prompting Vail to release an apology. In 2015 and 2016, Vail was the target of a swatting campaign, with repeated calls to the police between December 2015 and February 2016. At that time he resided in Layton, Utah. Vail's account was the target of several mass hacks, once in 2016 by hacker group Poodlecorp and again by OurMine in 2017. Controversies and channel termination Vail's YouTube channel LeafyIsHere was a drama channel, which commented on gossip involving online content creators. In 2016, YouTuber Ian Carter, known as iDubbbz, featured Leafy in an episode of his \\"Content Cop\\" series, accusing him and his videos of cyberbullying, among other things. In the same year, Vail accused YouTuber Evalion of supporting nazism and antisemitism. Shortly after Vail drew attention to her, Evalion was banned by YouTube. Also that year, Vail's statements regarding transgender vlogger Milo Stewart, where he criticized the concept of gender identity, were taken down by YouTube for harassment. The video was taken down later in 2019, after it was determined to be in violation of YouTube's guidelines. After a two-and-a-half year hiatus Vail returned to YouTube with a video insulting Carter in April 2020, following which he resumed posting frequently. In July, Vail began aggressively criticizing Twitch streamer Pokimane and her supporters based on speculation about Pokimane's personal life. On August 21, 2020, Vail's YouTube account was permanently terminated. According to The Verge, Vail's channel had three violations in the previous three months, such as cyberbullying and encouraging viewers to disrupt other people's streams. A YouTube spokesperson said the channel had repeatedly violated YouTube's policies on harassment. Following the ban, Vail joined the video sharing website Storyfire. He also began streaming near-daily on Twitch. On September 11, 2020, Vail's Twitch account was banned. Earlier that day, Vail had tweeted about receiving a strike on his account from Twitch for \\"hateful conduct and threats of violence against a person or group of people\\". Twitch did not comment on the ban or indicate whether it was permanent.

She is considered a pioneer in the study of hypertension and preventive medicine. In 1970, Thomas became the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine third female full professor. Early life and education Bedell was born on November 29, 1904, in Ithaca, New York to parents Mary Louise Crehore and Frederick Bedell. She graduated from Smith College in 1925 summa cum laude with an Bachelor of Arts degree before conducting her graduate work at Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of Herbert Spencer Jennings. Career Bedell joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University in 1930 as a house officer in their department of medicine. The following year, she was promoted to assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where she led studies in electrocardiography. As a result of her research, she was elected a Fellow of medicine with the National Research Council and a fellow in neuropathology at Harvard Medical School. Bedell returned to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as a faculty member following her Harvard fellowship in 1935. She also became a married woman to Dr. Henry M. Thomas, Jr, taking his last name. By 1936, while working with mice, she discovered that sulfanilamide could interrupt and prevent rheumatic heart disease and other infections. While working under mentor and department chair Warfield Theobald Longcope, she studied neurogenic models of hypertension and the effects sympathectomy has on blood pressure. Thomas simultaneously served as a physician at the Bryn Mawr School, a civilian consultant to the Army Surgeon General, and operated a private practice. Longcope eventually encouraged Thomas to start an adult cardiac, where she conducted a longitudinal study of predictors of heart disease, cancer, and suicide called \\"the Precursors Study.\\" Between the years of 1948 and 1964, Thomas conducted studies on 1,337 Johns Hopkins students and graduates, mostly made up of young, white males, in order to limit confounding factors. The original aim of the study was to determine precursors of heart disease by subjecting each participant to a series of physical exams and an 11-page questionnaire about eating and lifestyle habits, family history, and psychosocial characteristics. The results of her research found that of the males studied, those who developed coronary artery disease also had high cholesterol but not vice versa. She also found that graduates who suffered anxiety or depression as students were more likely to be fatigued and achieve lower academic standings. Thomas believed that physical diseases had genetic, environmental, psychological, and physiological components to them. This became the first longitudinal study used to determine predictors of heart disease, cancer, and suicide in youth. Prior to her retirement, Thomas published over 130 Precursors Study manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals. Future predictor studies such as the Framingham Heart Study, the Harvard Physicians Health Study, and the national Nurses Study have used her Precursors model as a guide. Although the study became influential, Thomas had a difficult time maintaining its funds. She would often take less salary money or end the cohort enrollment early. Due to lack of funds, 1964 was the last cohort Thomas studied. She became desperate enough for funds that she would offer family heirlooms to donors in exchange for donations, although no one ever accepted. Prior to ending the study, she received the 1957 James D. Bruce Memorial Award for her work in preventive medicine. In June 1970, Thomas was promoted to the rank of Full Professor, the third female to do so. She maintained this role until her retirement in 1986 at the age of 82. Thomas died on December 14, 1997, due to illness at Roland Park Place in Baltimore.

He is the current Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Research of the Human Sciences Research Council where he studies the social aspects of STIs and HIV/AIDS. In 2002, Simbayi was a part of the research team that conducted the first South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey and has been involved in the implementation of all subsequent surveys.  Career  Simbayi received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Experimental Psychology from the University of Sussex in England, United Kingdom. From 1986 to 2001, he taught courses in psychology at the undergraduate and graduate level at several different universities within Southern Africa. He is the former Head of Psychology Department at University of Fort Hare and the former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology at the University of the Western Cape. Since 2001, Simbayi has been primarily studying the social aspects of STIs and HIV/AIDS, including second-generation HIV surveillance, stigma, discrimination, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), and determinants of HIV infection. He also studies positive prevention methods used to reduce HIV risk infection which includes targeting HIV positive individuals who are aware of their status. He is the former regional coordinator in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) of the Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS Research Alliance (SAHARA). Simbayi has published over 100 scientific articles in peer-reviewed academic journals and has contributed to several research textbooks. He is a co-editor of the book, HIV/AIDS in South Africa 25 Years On: Psychosocial Perspectives.  HIV research  South Africa has one of the worst HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world, with an adult prevalence rate of approximately 18.90% and over 100,000 annual deaths, according to a 2016 estimate. In 2002 Simbayi was the project director for an Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, Nelson Mandela Foundation, and Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) collaborative study that analyzed HIV prevalence in the general population, behavioural risks of infection, and mass media exposure via biobehavioural surveys. This study was the first of its kind to establish a national estimate of HIV prevalence in South Africa. The study reported a prevalence rate of approximately 11.2%, which was much lower than previously expected, causing controversy amongst the WHO and UNAIDS who questioned the validity of the findings. However, around this time another research council, ORC Macro International, began testing in other African countries and produced similar results. Thus, global estimates were shifted accordingly. In 2005, Simbayi served in the same role for the second installment of the report. The report now included a measurement of HIV incidence, viral load, and ARV use. In 2008, Simbayi was the co-Principal Investigator for the third installment of the report which focused the health of children. In the 2012 report he was the Principal Investigator. The report sought to monitor the country's latest National Strategic Plan (NSP) for 2007-2011 and gather data for the upcoming NSP for 2012–2016. For the 2017 report Simbayi was the Overall Principal Investigator. The 2017 report focused on South Africa's efforts towards achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals. The 2008, 2012, and 2017 installments received funding from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The surveys garnered national attention and were included in subsequent HIV & AIDS and STI Strategic Plans for South Africa.  Media appearances  In December 2011, Simbayi appeared on a South African Broadcasting Corporation News segment to commemorate the 23rd World AIDS Day and discuss the country's new HIV and AIDS, STI and TB National Strategic Plan. In 2012, he appeared on another SABC News segment to discuss that year's South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behaviour Survey Report. Simbayi's opinion is also featured in several South African newspapers, including the Cape Times, The Sowetan, and Cape Argus.  Personal life  Simbayi has a wife, Ruth, and two children, Veronica and Kennedy.  Affiliations  Simbayi has worked under the Human Sciences Research Council since 2001. He has been Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Research since 2016 and was the Executive Director of the HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB research programme from 2010 to 2015. He is a current National Research Foundation-rated researcher, Honorary Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at the University of Cape Town, Member of the Academy of Science of South Africa, and a registered Research Psychologist with the Health Professions Council of South Africa's Professional Board of Psychology.

A trans man, his work explores transgender identity. He is best known for his work on transgender- related television shows, serving as an associate producer on Transparent and the director of its documentary spin-off This is Me. He is also known for his controversial debut feature film Adam. Early life and education Ernst transitioned at the age of 25. He has explained that media was his way of discovering queer identities, particularly MTV in his childhood and New Queer Cinema as he got older; these films also helped him \\"imagine a future\\" that seemed otherwise inaccessible from his hometown in North Carolina. He graduated from Hampshire College in 2004, with a BA in film; his graduation film was \\"The Drive North\\", which won an award at the Chicago International Film Festival. He then received an Master of Fine Arts from CalArts in 2011. His thesis film, \\"The Thing\\", premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2012. Between degrees, he served as associate producer of the Logo series Coming Out Stories. Career For several years, Ernst frequently creatively collaborated with Zackary Drucker, a trans woman who was also his partner at the time. They were included in the first iteration of the Hammer/LAX Art biennial in 2012, premiering the film \\"She Gone Rogue\\"; the film was also included in Outfest 2013. In 2014, Drucker and Ernst exhibited \\"Relationship\\" at the Whitney Museum of American Art, as part of the Whitney Biennial, through a series of photos that chronicled the process and evolution of the couple's relationship and gender transitions. In 2016, \\"Relationship\\" was released as a book. The couple began working on Transparent early in its production after Ernst met creator Jill Soloway at Sundance in 2012. They came on as associate producers, working in the production, casting and writing departments, as well as helping design the title sequence, which features archival footage from trans moments in history including parts of 1968 film The Queen. Ernst was also involved editing the title sequence and can be briefly seen in it. According to The New York Times Magazine, Drucker and Ernst's goal with the show was to ensure that trans people are depicted authentically on screen, including doing research as to the historic distinctions and identities in transgender and cross-dressing communities. In 2015, Ernst directed This is Me, a series of short documentaries inspired by a line said when the main character in Transparent comes out and executive produced by Soloway. This is Me \\"expands on the transgender issues\\" explored in Transparent's first season. Drucker stars in an episode of the series, for which they were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series. In 2016, Ernst created another short documentary series. Called We've Been Around, the six episodes detail moments in trans history and look at how trans individuals were excluded from lesbian and gay spaces. His motivation to create the series was to open up trans history, an interest he says he naturally held as a trans person but was exaggerated when he couldn't find trans masculine role models. For the show, he brought on historians and they \\"worked hard to find the best and most complete stories [with] diversity across race, gender, era and region\\", but still acknowledged it was quite US-centric. His directorial debut feature film was Adam in 2019. About half of the film's cast and crew were trans, with a majority of the cast being queer. The film received positive critical reviews upon its release at Sundance, but the outlook became more negative soon thereafter and the film was seen as controversial due to \\"queer missteps\\". Before the film was released, Ernst wrote a Medium article about his own apprehension towards receiving the script and thinking it would be offensive, saying he was \\"pleasantly surprised\\". Ernst and the film were compared by them.'s Sarah Fonseca to Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Fox and His Friends (1975) and Jamie Babbit's But I'm a Cheerleader (2000) because of this negative response from the queer community it aims to represent. Adam is based on Ariel Schrag's 2014 novel of the same name, which was received with outcry from the trans community, as it follows a privileged white, heterosexual, cisgender man as he pretends to be a trans man so that he can date a lesbian. There were also \\"accusations of questionable on-set conduct\\"; after these were denied, queer critics began defending the film. Ernst and critics defend Adam as having a nuance and being a reminder to trans people that life improved significantly in the time between its 2006 setting and 2019 release. Ernst has claimed that queer audiences at screenings react positively while the response from reviewers online \\"is so totally disparate and opposite from that. It's almost like cognitive dissonance\\", telling them. that appreciating the film is \\"really hard until people have a chance to see the film for themselves and really be able to have a real conversation about it\\", saying that he wants to start a conversation through the film. Hundreds of Twitter and Instagram posts, as well as several Change.org petitions, have called for the film to be boycotted or banned, due to being \\"deeply transphobic and lesbianphobic\\". BuzzFeed News describes the film as a \\"boundary-pushing artwork by and about underrepresented communities\\", with a representative of its distributor Wolfe Releasing and Ernst both saying they want to open a space for queer artists to tell whatever stories they want, with Ernst saying he especially does not want to be restricted to positive trans stories. Personal life and views Ernst met Drucker when she had recently graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York. Ernst had never dated a woman before, and Drucker had never dated a man. After they broke up, the former couple published photographs of them together from \\"Relationship\\" in 2016, which The New York Times stated was an important public record for transgender life. While working on Transparent, Ernst spoke about his disappointment that though trans stories were increasingly being told in media, these were mostly stories of trans women, feeling that trans men were being excluded because of a perception of patriarchy benefiting them in the way it does cis men. In the same interview, when asked about the casting of cisgender actor Jeffrey Tambor in the lead role, Ernst opined that when it is clear a work (comparing Transparent to Boys Don't Cry) has put in effort to be inclusive behind the camera and work on advancing trans causes, \\"the casting becomes less consequential\\".

Origins Brabant was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. The social origins of the Brabançons are uncertain. Some were the younger sons of the knightly class who had received formal military training. Others were drawn from the lower classes and had little or no such training. There were some women in their ranks. They mostly fought as infantry, possessing few horses. They were feared because of their ruthlessness, but probably had less of a tactical impact than the routiers of the later Middle Ages. Despite their name, the Brabançons came to be drawn from all across northern Europe. Walter Map in his De nugis curialium written about 1180 described the origins of the Brabançons thus: > A new and particularly noxious sect of heretics arose. The fighters of these > rotten were protected from head to foot by a leather jerkin, and were armed > with steel, staves and iron. They went about in bands of thousands and > reduced monasteries, villages and cities to ashes. With violence, yet > thinking it no sin, they committed adultery, saying \\"There is no God\\". This > movement arose in Brabant, hence the name Brabançons. From the start these > marauders drew up for themselves a curious law, which properly speaking was > based on no concept of right. Fugitive rebels, false clerks, renegade monks > and all who had forsaken God for any reason joined them. Groups of Brabançons are mentioned for the first time in a letter of 1166 from the abbot of Cluny, Stephen, to the king of France, Louis VII. They may have been unemployed mercenaries left over after the end in 1160 of the twenty-year war over Grimbergen between Count Godfrey III of Louvain and Walter II Berthout. The devastation of the land and the famine of 1162 may have left many men in search of employment. Renegade priests and monks often joined them, serving as chaplains, although they were regarded as heretics by the church. History Under the command of William of Cambrai, Brabançons took part in the Emperor Frederick I's campaign in Italy in 1167. Their first recorded battle is the battle of Tusculum on 29 May 1167. It was apparently these Brabançons who passed through Burgundy on their way to join the imperial army, so alarming the abbot of Cluny with their lack of discipline. The abbot gave their number as 400. The number in Frederick's army is variously given as 500 (Chronica regia Coloniensis), 800 (Otto of Sankt Blasien) or 1,500 (Vincent of Prague). The Annals of Magdeburg says that there were some from Flanders as well as Brabant. They fought so well in their first engagement that they were given all of the booty, the knights being satisfied with the victory alone. On their march home, they so devastated the county of Champagne and the archdiocese of Reims that Frederick I and Louis VII signed an agreement banning the use of Brabançons and coterelli in the area bounded by the Alps, the Rhine and the Paris Basin. This agreement was designed to keep the mercenaries out of France while leaving Frederick free to use them in Germany east of the Rhine or in Italy. Frederick I brought them into Italy a second time in 1175. King Henry II of England recruited Brabançons to crush the revolt of 1173–74. Roger of Howden estimated their strength at 10,000. Because he trusted them more than the other troops, according to Howden, Henry sent the Brabançons to relieve Louis VII's siege of Verneuil and occupy Brittany. In 1174, he brought them to England before returning with them to relieve Louis VII's siege of Rouen. The reputation of the Brabançons had been enough to prevent a Flemish invasion of England and force Louis VII to retreat from Verneuil. Count William VI of Angoulême brought them to the Poitou in 1177. They were defeated by the Poitevin knights at Barbezieux. The Count Richard of Poitou (the future Richard I of England) led a counterattack and captured William VI. The Brabançons, however, continued to ravage the countryside. They were defeated in the battle of Malemort on 21 April 1177 by a locally-raised army, including the militia of Malemort. William of Cambrai and over 2,000 Brabançon men and women were killed. The presence of William suggests that many of these mercenaries were veterans of the Tusculan campaign a decade earlier. William was succeeded as leader by Lobar the Wolf, in fact a Provençal. In 1173, Henry II had also raised mercenaries in southern France. In the winter of 1176–1177, Basque appeared in Aquitaine and thereafter the number of foreign mercenaries grew. Godfrey of Breuil recorded the foreigners as Brabançons, Hannuyers, Asperes, Pailler, Navar, Turlannales, Roma, Cotarel, Catalans, Aragones. The Third Lateran Council of 1179 forbade Christians the use Brabantiones, Aragonenses, Navarii, Bascoli, Coterelli and Triaverdini, referring to these same bands of mercenaries. They stood accused of disrespecting churches, killing women, children, the elderly, and waging war for the sake of loot. The bands were excommunicated. Nevertheless, their use continued. Before the end of 1179, they were used in Germany for the first and only time by Archbishop Philip of Cologne against Duke Henry of Saxony. Henry the Young King employed Brabançons against his father, Henry II, in 1183. When he died suddenly in June, the mercenaries began ravaging Aquitaine. Under Lobar's successor, another Provençal named Mercadier (died 1200), they were soon employed by Richard of Poitou. By this time the Brabançon companies were recruited from all over western Europe. The last recorded use of the Brabançons was by the English at the battle of Bouvines in 1214. These men were probably from Brabant and the Low Countries. They were under the command of Reginald of Boulogne, and were the last troops to break on the allied side. There were 400–700 mercenaries after the battle and probably not much more to start. Fighting style Although some occasionally fought on horseback, the Brabançon companies were overwhelmingly infantry. They are described as such during Henry II's campaign in 1173, the archbishop of Cologne's campaign in 1179 and the battle of Bouvines in 1214. Likewise, Walter Map's description of their arms and armour (leather jerkin) corresponds to those of infantry. At Bouvines, the Brabançons arrayed in a circle two ranks deep with their pikes in the ground.

Biography  Ackers was an actress in theater and cabarets in Göttingen, Riga, and Berlin. In the early 1920s, Ackers began working in films, writing and starring in the silent film Burning Country (Brennendes Land). In 1921, she was in the cast of Florentine Nights: the Adventures of the Count of Costa (Florentinische Nächte: Die Abenteuer der Gräfin da Costa), written by Heinrich Heine. Ackers moved to Hannover in 1927 with her partner, the artist Irma Johanna Schäfer; they moved to the small town of Glonn in 1935. Ackers died in Glonn in 1982.  Freundinnen  Ackers wrote Girlfriends: a Novel (about Women) (Freundinnen: Ein Roman (unter Frauen)), published in Hannover in 1923 and 1925 and in Berlin in 1927 and 1928. The novel explores lesbian desire in the setting of the artistic and theatrical society of Weimar Berlin. It also touches on issues of gender and sexuality: in response to being asked if one is \\"a girl or a boy,\\" a character playing Puck responds: \\"I am what I am.\\" Freundinnen appeared in several editions of between 7,000 and 10,000 copies. The National Socialists banned the book in 1934 and it appeared on the official list of banned books in 1936, including in Alfred Rosenberg's anti- lesbian pamphlet Der Sumpf. In the 1990s, the book was rediscovered by feminists and academics. Freundinnen was republished in 1995 by a German feminist publishing house.

Last, in De Nederlandsche Stoompost from June 6th, 1847 Van der Gaag Lane (Dutch: Laantje van Van der Gaag) was a short privately-owned road south of Delft in the Netherlands, notable for being the subject of a frog war between property developer A.H.J. van Wickevoort Crommelin and the operator of the Netherlands' first railway, Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij. The lane was purchased from the innkeeper J. van der Gaag in 1845 to serve as a holdout property, whose sole purpose was to block the construction of the Rotterdam-Hague railway in retaliation for the rail operator's refusal to add to the earlier Haarlem-Leiden line a train station that would serve Zandvoort, a town which van Wickevoort Crommelin was intent on promoting as a seaside resort. After a drawn-out expropriation process that took almost two years and failed to acquire the land, the railway company finally completed the line with a sharp bend around Crommelin's road, which served for only five days before the landowner caved to legal pressure and gave the land to the railway company for free. Background In 1842, HIJSM began acquiring land for the Haarlem-Leiden Railway, the first railway line in the Netherlands. One parcel of land, located near the town of Zandvoort, was owned by local property developer A.H.J van Wickevoort Crommelin, who agreed to sell it to the railway company provided that they build a station serving the town, which he had plans to develop into a seaside resort. The HIJSM declined his request on the basis that the Haarlem-Leiden Railway was to be an express line with no intermediate stops at all. In light of this, Crommelin agreed to sell the land without the obligation to add a stop, assuming that stagecoaches would continue to serve intermediate points such as Zandvoort in the absence of railway stations. Much to Crommelin's annoyance, however, when the line opened in August 1842, it had no fewer than five intermediate stops. When queried, the HIJSM responded that upon being given the same ultimatum that Crommelin had offered (land for a reasonable price in return for a station) by multiple different landowners along the line, the company had changed its policy and agreed to build intermediate stops. With residents of intermediate towns now being served by the railway, stagecoach services had ceased, and Zandvoort was left without public transit. Land dispute In 1845, after having unsuccessfully petitioned the railway operator to build a station at Zandvoort the previous year, van Wickevoort Crommelin, in collaboration with the Mayor of Zandvoort, devised a scheme to get the station built by sabotaging the HIJSM's next railway project, a line connecting Rotterdam with the Hague. He did this by purchasing a cheap piece of land in the planned path of the railway, and refusing to sell it unless the railway company agreed to build a station at Zandvoort. The land plot in question was a short lane only a few meters wide, bought from local innkeeper J. Van der Gaag for the sum of 200 Dutch Guilders. Noticing the acquisition of the land, the HIJSM offered Crommelin 100 Dutch Guilders for it, an offer that he refused, stipulating instead that the company could have the land for his purchase price of 200 Dutch Guilders if a station was built at Zandvoort. The Board of Administration initially agreed, drafting a plan to construct the station with a service frequency comparable to other intermediate stops on the line, and to pay compensation of 20,000 guilders if service was ever discontinued. For unknown reasons, however, executives from the HIJSM jumped the gun on the board's ruling, and began an expropriation process that would see the land acquired from Crommelin without the construction of the Zandvoort station. This process took two years and failed to acquire the land, by which time the railway was almost ready to commence services. The railway's solution was to construct a sharp bend around the disputed property. Five days after this was built, Crommelin, worn down by the legal battle, handed the land to the railway company for free, and the track was realigned in a straight line.

Biography Giovanni Battista della Pietra was born on 17 October 1871 in Cornegliano, Italy. He was ordained a priest of the Society of Jesus on 18 September 1904. On 9 March 1927, Pope Pius XI named him titular archbishop of Chalcedon and Apostolic Delegate to Albania. He received his episcopal consecration on 19 March 1927 from Cardinal Willem van Rossum. In Albania he sought to promote conversions among the Orthodox and develop missions for Latin rite Catholics, while contending with the government's promotion of a national Orthodox church. He also served as Apostolic Administrator of some dioceses. After he made repeated requests to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, the Jesuit superior general, and the pope, della Pietra was allowed to return to his earlier religious life in 1936, without any of the honors associated with the rank of bishop. He became head of the postulates house in Lonigo and then rector of the diocesan seminary in Fiume. His gravestone in the Fiume cemetery identifies him as a priest, not a bishop. Della Pietra died on 26 August 1940 at the age of 68.

The Supreme Court of Canada has characterised the idea that aboriginal title is sui generis as the unifying principle underlying the various dimensions of that title. Like other aboriginal rights, aboriginal title must be understood by reference to both common law and aboriginal perspectives. Aboriginal title is properly characterized as neither a personal right nor a real right nor a combination of the two even though it may appear to have characteristics of both real and personal rights. Aboriginal title refers to the concept of a sui generis right in land that originates from the exclusive occupation and use of a specific territory by an aboriginal group over which the group has a native historic attachement.  Source of aboriginal title  In St. Catherine’s Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen, the Supreme Court initially described aboriginal title as a “personal and usufructuary right” which derives its source from the Royal Proclamation of 1763. However, the Supreme Court understanding of aboriginal title in Canadian constitutional law changed over time. Despite the fact that the Royal Proclamation recognized the existence of aboriginal title, it is now clear that this constitutional document does not constitute the source of aboriginal title. Aboriginal title in Canada arises from the prior occupation of land by indigenous people. It is based on the existence of an “occupation” of land prior to assertion of European sovereignty. This prior occupation is of importance and illustrates the sui generis nature of aboriginal title. In Guerin v The Queen, the Supreme Court described aboriginal title as a right that derives from indigenous people's historic occupation and possession of their traditional lands. As such, what makes aboriginal title sui generis is that it arrises from a possession of land before the assertion of British sovereignty. This element of aboriginal title differentiates it from estates such as fee simple estates which arise after the British assertion of sovereignty. However, aboriginal title does confer ownership rights similar to those associated with a fee simple In Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia, the Supreme Court stated: \\"The characteristics of Aboriginal title flow from the special relationship between the Crown and the Aboriginal group in question. It is this relationship that makes Aboriginal title sui generis or unique. Aboriginal title is what it is, the unique product of the historic relationship between the Crown and the Aboriginal group in question. Analogies to other forms of property ownership, for example, fee simple, may help us to understand aspects of Aboriginal title. But they cannot dictate precisely what it is or is not. As Justice Gérard Vincent La Forest put it in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, Aboriginal title “is not equated with fee simple ownership; nor can it be described with reference to traditional property law concepts\\".  The Content of Aboriginal Title  Aboriginal title to land can be described by two main characteristics. First, aboriginal title encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes. This exclusive use and occupation of land does not need to be aspects of those aboriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures. In other words, aboriginal title to land is not limited in any way to the historic and traditional uses of land by aboriginal people (e.g. hunting, fishing). Instead, aboriginal title encompass a wide variety of uses that includes natural ressources on and under the ground. Aboriginal title confers the right to decide how the land will be used, enjoyed, occupied, possessed, pro-actively use and managed, and the right to the economic benefits of the land. In other words, \\"[w]hat aboriginal title confers is the right to the land itself\\". But, there is an inherent limit to these uses which can be described by the second main characteristic of aboriginal title. Lands held pursuant to aboriginal title cannot be used in a manner that is irreconcilable with the nature of the attachment to the land which forms the basis of the group’s claim to aboriginal title. In other words, the exclusive protected use of land by indigenous people must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the group’s attachment to that land.  Proof of Aboriginal Title  In Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, the Supreme Court stated that in order to make out a claim for aboriginal title, the aboriginal group asserting title must satisfy three main criteria. First, the asserted land must have been occupied by the aboriginal group prior to sovereignty. Second, if present occupation of the asserted land is relied on by the aboriginal group as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation. And finally, at sovereignty, the occupation of the asserted land must have been exclusive.  Sufficiency of Occupation  It has been clearly established that the question of sufficient occupation must be approached from both the common law perspective and the Aboriginal perspective. In assessing a claim for the existence of title rights, it is \\"crucial to be sensitive to the aboriginal perspective itself on the meaning of the rights at stake\\". The Aboriginal perspective of the group asserting title not only focuses on laws, but also practices, customs and traditions. In considering whether occupation sufficient to ground title is established, \\"one must take into account the group’s size, manner of life, material resources, and technological abilities, and the character of the lands claimed\\". \\"Physical occupation may be established in a variety of ways, ranging from the construction of dwellings through cultivation and enclosure of fields to regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources\\". An Aboriginal group must demonstrate that it has historically acted in a way that would communicate to third parties that it held the land for its own purposes. To show sufficiency of occupation, it is not required to prove notorious or visible use, but the occupation cannot be purely subjective or internal. There must be some evidence of a strong presence over the land claimed. This presence must manifest itself in acts of occupation that could reasonably be interpreted as demonstrating that the land in question belonged to, was controlled by, or was under the exclusive stewardship of the claimant group. It is imperative that the notion of occupation reflects the specific way of life of the Aboriginal group asserting title. \\"The kinds of acts necessary to indicate a permanent presence and intention to hold and use the land for the group’s purposes are dependent on the manner of life of the people and the nature of the land\\". It has been clearly established that cultivated fields, constructed dwelling houses, invested labour, and a consistent presence on parts of the land are not essential to establish occupation. The Supreme Court has confirmed that nomadic and semi-nomadic groups can establish title to land. Sufficient occupation is a \\"question of fact, depending on all the circumstances, in particular the nature of the land and the manner in which it is commonly used\\". For example, physical occupation sufficient to ground title to land may be established by \\"regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources\\".  Continuity of Occupation  As proof of pre-sovereignty occupation, an Aboriginal group may provide evidence of present occupation in order to make out a claim for aboriginal title. If present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre- sovereignty occupation. \\"The concept of continuity does not require Aboriginal groups to provide evidence of an unbroken chain of continuity between their current practices, customs and traditions, and those which existed prior to contact\\". Continuity means that the present occupation must be rooted in pre- sovereignty times. As stated by Chief Justice Lamer in R. v. Van der Peet: \\"It may be that for a period of time an aboriginal group, for some reason, ceased to engage in a practice, custom or tradition which existed prior to contact, but then resumed the practice, custom or tradition at a later date. Such an interruption will not preclude the establishment of an aboriginal right\\". Furthermore, the fact that the nature of occupation by an Aboriginal group has changed over time does not ordinarily preclude a claim for aboriginal title. However, a substantial connection between the people and the land claimed must have been maintained.  Exclusivity of Occupation  The third requirement to establish Aboriginal title is exclusive occupation of the land at the time of assertion of European sovereignty. The Aboriginal group must have had \\"the intention and capacity to retain exclusive control\\" over the lands. As noted by Justice Lamer in Delgamuukw: \\"As with the proof of occupation, proof of exclusivity must rely on both the perspective of the common law and the aboriginal perspective, placing equal weight on each\\".The exclusivity requirement must also take into account the context and characteristics of the Aboriginal society. In Delgamuukw, the Supreme Court explained that a consideration of the Aboriginal perspective may lead to the conclusion that trespass by other Aboriginal groups not only does not undermine their claim, but that the presence of those groups by permission may reinforce, the exclusive occupation of the Aboriginal group asserting title. \\"For example, the aboriginal group asserting the claim to Aboriginal title may have trespass laws which are proof of exclusive occupation, such that the presence of trespassers does not count as evidence against exclusivity. As well, Aboriginal laws under which permission may be granted to other Aboriginal groups to use or reside even temporarily on land would reinforce the finding of exclusive occupation. Indeed, if that permission were the subject of treaties between the aboriginal nations in question, those treaties would also form part of the Aboriginal perspective\\". Acts of trespass do not necessarily undermine a general finding of exclusivity, and may even reinforce a finding of exclusivity of occupation if aboriginal groups intended to and attempted to enforce their exclusive occupation. It has been suggested that \\"where others were allowed access upon request, the very fact that permission was asked for and given would be further evidence of the group's exclusive control\\".

Origins On July 17, 1946, J. B. Powell, correspondent, and Helen Loomis, missionary teacher, founded the American China Policy Association (ACPA). Alfred Kohlberg, a leader in the China Lobby joined as chairman shortly thereafter to promote American interests by promoting the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomitang as a counter to Soviet and Chinese Communist support.

In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party seized full control of mainland China and established the People's Republic of China, the ACPA accused the United States Department of State of \\"losing China.\\" ACPA supported its allegations with copious literate: letters, pamphlets, brochures, press releases, and book reviews. Kohlberg's name went on most of those publications.

Andra Stevanović and architect Nikola Nestorović collaborated on several major projects in Belgrade that are now considered cultural monuments. Biography His father was Joca Stevanović, a civil servant. He finished elementary school and high school in Belgrade in 1877. In 1881, he graduated from the Technical Faculty of the Grande école (the future university) in Belgrade and immediately got a job in the civil service, where he spent two years working as a sub-engineer in the Belgrade district. Like most Serbian engineers of the time, he had to do his post-graduate studies abroad. In 1883, he began studying at the Berlin's Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg, where he remained for several years and acquired solid practical knowledge. He graduated and passed the state exam, which was a rarity for an alien in Germany, a privilege given to a small number of foreigners. He returned to Serbia and got a job at the beginning of 1890 as an engineer in the Ministry of Construction, where he stayed for only three months. He was elected professor at the Technical Faculty of his alma mater in Belgrade, where he worked until his retirement in 1924. He was among the first eight full professors of the University of Belgrade in 1905, who elected the entire other teaching staff. They were Jovan Žujović, Sima Lozanić, Jovan Cvijić, Mihailo Petrović Alas, Andra Stevanović, Dragoljub Pavlović, Milić Radovanović and Ljubomir Jovanović. He thus achieved his life ideal, to which he remained faithful for the rest of his life. He turned down many more lucrative positions in the state apparatus and chose to work with students. During his life, he dedicated most of his energy to university work and education. He was a good expert and a good speaker. He supported the will of the students for the vocation they had chosen. In addition to pedagogy, he was engaged in the design and study of old church monuments, Oplenac in particular.He was elected a member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1910 and was the secretary of its Art Department for a long time. When he retired, he was awarded the title of Honorary Doctor of Science of the University of Belgrade. Andra Stevanović participated a lot in the public life of Belgrade and Serbia, which most likely prevented him from achieving greater results in the field of science and design. He died in Belgrade after returning from one of his study trips. Kulturna Dobra Beograda Significant architectural works * National Museum of Serbia with Nikola Nestorović; * House V.

Plot Anybody who inadvertently consumes the flowers of the poisonous shuimang plant is turned into a shuimang ghost who cannot reincarnate until another victim of shuimang poisoning takes their place; shuimang ghosts are especially prevalent in Hunan. Zhu (), a scholar, is offered tea by an old woman while on his way to visiting a peer; he declines the foul-smelling drink but is offered a better cup of tea by Sanniang (), a young attendant to the old woman. Pocketing one of Sanniang's rings and promising to return, Zhu suspects that something is amiss upon reaching home. After experiencing chest pains, he confides in a friend, who deduces that Sanniang belongs to the Kou () family and had died of shuimang poisoning herself. Zhu succumbs to the poison and his widowed wife remarries shortly after, leaving their one-month- old son in Zhu's mother's care. One day, Zhu (now a ghost) visits his mother and announces that he had located Kou Sanniang's reincarnated self and \\"went thither and dragged her spirit back\\". Having exchanged wedding vows in the underworld, Zhu and his new wife take up residence at Zhu's former home. Upon learning of the incredible news, Kou's parents rush to Zhu's place. She tells them that the old woman, Ni (), had also died of shuimang poisoning but was \\"too ugly to entrap people herself\\", and has since been reborn. Thereafter, Kou maintains perfunctory relations with her parents, while Zhu does not even visit his in-laws. Another villager dies of shuimang poisoning but is brought back to life after Zhu prevents another shuimang ghost, Li Jiu (), from letting the recently deceased's soul take his place. From then on, Zhu similar intervenes in other shuimang poisoning cases.

Background  left Joseph Konde-Lule holds degrees as a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery as well as a Master of Public Health. He was an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, now under the School of Public Health, at Makerere University in Uganda from 1977 until 2014. He additionally served as the first head of the department. Throughout his career, Konde-Lule has amassed over seventy-two publications to his name, many of them focusing on understanding social determinants of HIV and its spread within Uganda. His career in public health research began with his thesis which focused on syphilis prevalence and how understanding of the virus, or lack thereof, was allowing it to continue to spread within communities. He later applied this research background to understanding HIV/AIDS prevalence when he began work in Kasangati, Uganda in 1987.  Research in Rakai, rural Uganda  New HIV infections each year, and AIDS deaths occurring during the year in Uganda; data from UNAIDS AIDSinfo It is generally accepted by epidemiologists that the decline of HIV prevalence in Uganda was largely due to efforts focused on changing behavior; HIV is a virus currently without a cure. Therefore, for prevalence to decline, populations of infected individuals must decline as well. Uganda created \\"one of the most extensive AIDS education programs in Africa\\" in part due to the targeted mitigation strategies crafted from the work conducted in Rakai starting in 1989. The Rakai Project was a research initiative funded by both Columbia University and the Uganda Ministry of Health so as to better understand the disease and its spread. Based on the work conducted by this research initiative, it was discovered that three communities are predominantly at risk of contracting HIV in Uganda: those near trading centers, small villages by secondary roads, and rural agrarian villages. The effectiveness of Uganda's containment strategy involves the fact that HIV research was focused on ways to prevent further spread of HIV. Thus, with time and targeted research initiatives, fewer people contracted HIV and prevalence began to decline. The location of Rakai within Uganda The peak of Dr. Joseph Konde-Lule's work occurred in his work on the Rakai Project. Many of Dr. Joseph Konde-Lule's Rakai studies sought to determine populations of heightened risk of contracting HIV in Uganda. This was largely driven by the finding that many individuals in the Rakai district indicated substantial understanding of AIDS and prevention techniques, like the use of condoms, yet were still experiencing high rates of infection. In particular, studies found that those individuals in charge of the household were at high risk of contracting HIV, indicating the ways the disease could impact economics and social organization in a household. Additional risk factors included employment that required mobility and migration and involvement in the cash economy. In addition to identifying these high risk groups, Konde-Lule's work in Rakai sought to understand the sexual networks of transmission. Of particular interest for future policy included the finding that girls had a significantly higher HIV infection rate than boys of the same age group seemingly due to the fact that girls were more likely to engage in sexual relationships with older men, a group with already heightened HIV rates compared to younger boys in the community. Additionally, married individuals were expressing higher prevalence of HIV than unmarried individuals, a finding that ran counter to previous speculation.  Achievements  In 1990, Konde-Lule was recognized as a Takemi Fellow of the Harvard School of Public Health, an acknowledgement of the significant work he contributed to the improvement of public health in Uganda. In 1990, he also received a competitive ITAPS fellowship from University of California at San Francisco for his project \\"Assessment of the rate of progression of HIV infection in a Ugandan cohort during 5 years of follow-up.\\" References External links  * *Makerere University Page *Mention in The New York Times Category:HIV/AIDS in Uganda Category:Makerere University academics Category:Makerere University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Ugandan epidemiologists Category:Harvard School of Public Health people Category:University of California, San Francisco alumni Category:Disease transmission Category:Risk factors ","title":"Joseph Konde-Lule"},{"id":"64260604","text":"Kaufdorf railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Kaufdorf, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

Nührenberg studied physics at the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he received his doctorate from in 1969 (translated: Linear and Toroidal Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria). He was a post-doctoral student at the University of Iowa and the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University. In 1971, he worked at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Garching near Munich, where he dealt with the theory of stellarators for controlled nuclear fusion. In 1979, he became the head of the group \\"Theorie dreidimensionaler Systeme\\" (Theory of three-dimensional systems) and in 1981 the head of the group \\"Stellaratorphysik\\" (Stellarator Physics). In 1996, he became a scientific member of the IPP. In 1997, he became the Greifswald branch director of the IPP and a professor at the University of Greifswald. In the 1980s, Nührenberg and Allen Boozer developed methods to optimize the magnetic field of the stellarator in such a way that the stability of plasma confinement became comparable to those of the tokamak. In contrast to tokamakas, stellarators work continuously but have more complicated magnetic fields that do not have simple rotational symmetry. Boozer formulated conditions of stability for the stellarator magnetic fields (including quasi-symmetry) and Nührenberg showed that these could be implemented in concrete magnetic field configurations. These concepts were then experimentally realized in the Wendelstein 7-AS stellerator and later paved the way for the development of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Greifswald. Since 1990, Nührenberg has been a member of the project management team involved in the planning of the Wendelstein 7-X and has played a key role in its development. In 2010, he received the Hannes Alfvén Prize with Allen Boozer for \\"the formulation and practical application of criteria allowing stellarators to have good fast-particle and neoclassical energy confinement\\".

His most well known song was his 1922 piece Ikh bin a “boarder” bay mayn vayb (I’m a Boarder at My Wife’s).  Early life  Doctor's father was a kosher meat tax collector, and until the age of fourteen he had a traditional Jewish education in a Cheder. At some point in the 1890s, possibly 1896, he emigrated to England, where he began his involvement in the musical theater while supporting himself as a hairdresser. He met many of the actors in the London Yiddish Theater milieu and eventually made his debut as the character Marcus in Abraham Goldfaden's The Sorceress.  Musical career  It was in 1908 or possibly 1910 that Doctor relocated to the United States, where some of his family members were already living, and began to see real success in the musical theater, and especially as a Yiddish language songwriter. His compositions were used in the Yiddish musical theater, vaudeville, radio, and commercial recordings. He published at least 100 songs and recorded more than 50. Although he is less remembered for these, he apparently wrote plays as well, such as Der kales kind (\\"the Bride's Child\\") in 1912. For a time he was also active in union politics, as in 1919 he was listed as the secretary of the American Hebrew Vaudeville Actors Union.

Early life and Australia Carkeek was born in Swansea, Wales, on 12 April 1815; his name is Cornish, as his father Morgan was a Cornish sea captain who had moved to Swansea. Stephen Carkeek joined the Navy (possibly after attending the Royal Naval College) and in late 1837 came to New South Wales as the first officer of a convict transportation ship. He then worked for the colonial administration in Sydney and was appointed first officer of the revenue cutter Ranger, a coastal patrol vessel that enforced tariffs, on 21 February 1838. He became commander of the Ranger and its crew of 13, based in Port Phillip, on 23 July 1839. In Sydney he married Martha Piotti (1807–1892), and his daughter Frances was born there in 1840. Career in New Zealand On 3 March 1840 he and the Ranger were loaned to the New Zealand colonial administrators (New Zealand was still administered by New South Wales at the time) under the orders of William Hobson. Carkeek acted as a government pilot, and with Felton Mathew surveyed the Firth of Thames, the Waitematā harbour, and the Hauraki Gulf. He also transported government stores and officials around the Bay of Islands and Auckland, confiscating stolen or indebted ships and returning runaway convicts to Sydney. Carkeek resigned his position in Sydney and was assigned the government brig Victoria on 18 March 1841, transporting Māori chiefs to Mahia, goods to the Marsdens, and George Cooper and his family from Russell (then known as Kororareka) in the Bay of Islands to Auckland. However after neglecting some victualling paperwork he was forced to hand over command of the brig on 23 April 1841. He and his family settled in the port of Russell, where Carkeek was soon employed as landing-waiter (a customs house officer in charge of the landing of cargo) and tide surveyor. On a salary of £200, he enforced permits and fines on the sale of liquor – a significant revenue stream for the young colony. On 7 February 1842 Carkeek was ordered to move to the newly-established settlement of Nelson, promoted to landing-waiter and sub-collector of customs (but at the same salary). His two-room house, which for nine months had also been serving as the customhouse in Russell, accompanied him when he arrived in the Abercrombie on 5 March – its transportation cost £86 9s, which he had to borrow from his superior. The customhouse was set up on Wakefield Quay, and Carkeek began collecting duties on landed goods and intercepting alcohol being smuggled ashore, which made him unpopular with the settlers. He employed five armed boatmen, \\"in view of the desperate boats\\" frequenting the area. By 1843 Carkeek was harbourmaster and member of the board of management, taking over responsibilities for the postal service as well (again at no extra pay); he was also on the Committee of the Nelson Literary Institution. During his time in Nelson Carkeek was known for his long trenchant letters to authorities defending the rights and duties of customs officials. When Governor FitzRoy abolished Customs on 30 September 1844 (a six-month free-trade experiment which contributed to him being recalled), Carkeek continued all his other duties, as one of the town's only civil servants, on just £92 a year. He was reappointed with back pay in April 1845. At this time Nelson customs was collecting revenue of over £1000 per annum. On 1 July 1849 Carkeek was promoted and moved to Wellington to become Acting Collector of Customs there, at double his Nelson salary. On 14 July 1849 The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle noted: > The Government brig, when she sailed last week, took from us our late and > much-respected Collector of Customs, Harbour-Master, Postmaster, and Sub- > Treasurer. All these offices, and several more, has Mr. Carkeek filled in > this settlement since it was first founded, or since some of the departments > were established; and a more efficient Government servant, or one held in > higher esteem by the public, we are sure is nowhere to the found. As it > sometimes will happen to meritorious men, Mr. Carkeek has been, we should > think, the hardest-worked and worst-paid, of any officer of the Government > in the colony, though filling several very responsible posts. The \\"Acting\\" was dropped from Carkeek's job title after four years in Wellington, and he became Collector of Customs. He took up numerous other responsibilities: postmaster, magistrate, Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, firearms licensor, running the Interprovincial Steam Postal Service, and arranging the re-roofing of Wellington's first Government House. He was nominated as Collector of Customs to the General Legislative Council on 19 May 1851, and attended the last two sessions (both held in Wellington) before the council ceased to exist in 1853. He stood unsuccessfully for the three-member City of Wellington electorate in the 1855 general election. A pertinent question at the time was the power balance between central and provincial governments, with Carkeek a strong anti-provincialist. There were initially four candidates, and Charles Clifford and William Fitzherbert tried to talk Robert Hart into forming a group to oppose Carkeek. When Hart decided to team up with Carkeek, the other two looked for a third candidate for their team and recruited the Superintendent of the Wellington Province, Isaac Featherston. Carkeek and Hart were narrowly beaten, with Carkeek 14 votes behind Fitzherbert (258 votes to 244). Carkeek was appointed Commissioner of Customs in 1858 and New Zealand's first Secretary and Inspector of Customs in 1865, and was responsible for opening a customs service on the Chatham Islands in 1856. Amongst other posts, he was appointed a Captain commanding the Wellington Militia 2nd Company in 1860, and subsequently the Wellington Rifle Volunteers; although he resigned his commission in 1864, he was often referred to as \\"Captain Carkeek\\" thereafter. The Customs House building on the Wellington waterfront showing the time ball During this time he was a keen amateur astronomer and member of the Wellington Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute (the Wellington Independent on 23 January 1866 reported the theft of one of his telescopes). He was also interested in chronometry, helping to repair the clock in St Peter's Church on Willis Street. Both these interests possibly hearkened back to his years at sea. In 1862 Carkeek suggested that a transit observatory and time ball – the first in New Zealand – be added to the new Customs House due to be built on reclaimed land on the Wellington waterfront; a time service was important for captains of visiting ships needing to correct their chronometers. In December 1863 an astronomical clock arrived from Britain, and it was connected electrically to the time ball so that the ball dropped at noon each day (but never on Sundays). The time ball began operation on 8 March 1864. Carkeek used a 23-inch transit instrument in the adjacent observatory to establish its longitude (174° 49′ 15′′). The combined facility was known as the Provincial Observatory; at the time of its first drop, Carkeek claimed the time ball was the first in the Southern Hemisphere, and himself the country's first astronomer. Retirement and family Carkeek took early retirement from the civil service in on 1 April 1866 at the age of 50, on a pension of £364. He was replaced by William Seed (1827–1890). Carkeek moved to the Wairarapa to become a sheep farmer on Torohanga, a 200 acre property just south of Featherston – a town named after his political opponent. The Wellington Independent noted at the time: > S. Carkeek, Esq., Inspector of H.M. Customs for the Colony of New Zealand > has resigned his appointment, and after a service of many years retires into > private life. By his kindness and urbanity, Mr. Carkeek has endeared himself > to many in this city, and it will be with feelings of unfeigned regret that > the announcement of his retirement is learnt. For some time past severe > indisposition has prevented Mr. Carkeek attending to his duties, and even > now, though in a great measure convalescent, he is far from well. In his retirement in Featherston, Carkeek was heavily involved in the community: a magistrate, chairman of the local school committee, and member of the Agricultural and Pastoral Association. In 1878 he had tired of sheep farming, and decided to sell Torohanga. After visiting Tauranga to see his daughter Ellen, wife of the postmaster, he resolved to move there, but a few weeks later he took ill and died at the age of 63. His death certificate referred to chronic alcoholism and bronchitis. He and his wife Martha had eight children, four of which survived to adulthood: brothers Arthur (1843–1897) and Morgan (1846–1927) were both surveyors, and two daughters, Frances Ann Stewart (1840–1916) and Martha Ellen Sheath (1851–1886). After the death of his father in Wales, Carkeek had brought his mother and sister Frances (1820–1869) to Nelson; his mother died there in 1849, and his sister married hotel keeper Thomas Davis in 1856 and moved to Palmerston.  Observatory  Carkeek was a keen amateur astronomer, and built a small observatory out of tōtara and hand-made iron nails for his two telescopes. He worked alone, supplying meteorological observations to the local newspaper, and observing Jupiter’s satellites, lunar eclipses, and moon culminations. In early March 1871 the observatory was well established, as The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle noted: > The stream which comes from the Rimutaka [Mountains], forms the eastern > boundary of Mr. Carkeek’s garden. This rose so high as to flood the house, > in which there was at one time nearly three feet of water ... Mr. Carkeek > had just had his observatory refitted, and shelves with valuable books > raised from the floor, the outsides of which became covered with mud, but > fortunately the insides are very little damaged. The garden has a great deal > of mud left upon it ... Both English and American astronomical groups visited New Zealand to observe the 1874 transit of Venus, and Carkeek's observatory was mentioned as one facility that might be used, but he did not in the end participate. The partly ruined building still remains, and is New Zealand's oldest surviving observatory. After his death in 1878 his chattels and livestock were auctioned on 17 December of that year, but the auction notice did not mention telescopes or astronomy books. What happened to his \\"numerous valuable notes and observations\\", promised to the Wairarapa Standard just weeks before he died, is unknown. The observatory site has been proposed as a Category I historic place in the Heritage New Zealand List.

It is currently at Avenida Thiers 111 in Colonia Anzures, part of the alcaldía (municipality) of Miguel Hidalgo in northwestern Mexico City. History The Philippines first opened a diplomatic mission in Mexico with the opening of a legation on April 23, 1953, shortly after the two countries established full diplomatic relations, with Mariano Espeleta serving as the mission's first minister. It was upgraded to a full embassy in 1960, with Octavio L. Maloles becoming the first resident Philippine ambassador after presenting his credentials to President Adolfo López Mateos on September 12, 1961. After a massive expansion of the Philippines' diplomatic presence abroad during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, in 2010 Senator Franklin Drilon questioned the need for embassies in countries with small Filipino communities, and called for a review of the Philippines' diplomatic presence worldwide. This would lead to the closure of ten posts under Arroyo's successor, Benigno Aquino III, and ultimately to the closure of the embassies in Havana and Caracas by October 31, 2012. The Embassy's jurisdiction, which at the time consisted only of Mexico and Central America, was expanded in 2013 to include Cuba, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic to account for the closure of both posts, although jurisdiction over Venezuela was subsequently transferred to the Philippine Embassy in Brasília. The Embassy's chancery, at the time occupying the first two stories of an eight-story building in the centrally-located Delegación Cuauhtémoc, was badly damaged in the 2017 Puebla earthquake, requiring it to temporarily operate from the ambassadorial residence as it was vacated. The current chancery was formally opened on March 14, 2018, coinciding with the Embassy's official celebrations for International Women's Day. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Mexico City is currently headed by Ambassador Demetrio R. Tuason, who was appointed to the position by President Rodrigo Duterte on November 27, 2017. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Tuason, a businessman, was chairman emeritus of the Arms Corporation of the Philippines (Armscor). His appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments a week later on December 5, 2017. Many of the Embassy's activities center around promoting the deep cultural ties between the Philippines and Mexico. These included exhibiting the paintings of Filipino painter Manuel Baldemor at the Fort of San Diego in Acapulco, hosting a book launch on the cultural relations between the two countries in 2017, organizing events surrounding the centennial of Philippine cinema at the 2019 Guanajuato International Film Festival, and supporting a master class on Filipino cuisine at the Mexico City campus of Le Cordon Bleu. Some of these activities, such as celebrating the Manila galleon trade, are directly related to the history of both countries as former Spanish colonies, with at least three ambassadors having made courtesy calls to the mayor of Acapulco as a result. Aside from promoting ties between the Philippines and Mexico, like other missions the Embassy also provides assistance to Filipinos within its jurisdiction, whether resident or visiting. It has offered to evacuate and repatriate Filipinos in Venezuela and Nicaragua when those countries experienced unrest, while also offering assistance to Filipinos potentially affected by the 2018 Volcán de Fuego eruption in Guatemala, and facilitating the visit of Filipino delegates attending the 2019 World Youth Day in Panama with a hotline specifically designated for their use. The jurisdiction of the Embassy is expected to change with the opening of new missions within Central America, namely the future reopening of the embassy in Havana, and the possible opening of an embassy in Panama City.

Life Cengiz Doğu went to school in Izmir and studied Turkish language and literature from 1965 till 1974 in Istanbul. He was politically active since 1966, as he approached the Workers' Party of Turkey ideologically and co-founded the \\"Student Association of Turkish Studies\\" in 1968. After 1971 Turkish military memorandum, all student associations were banned, and Cengiz Doğu was jailed for 20 days. He completed his military service from 1975 to 1977, but his studies were cancelled in 1977. He worked as a newspaper proofreader and emigrated to Germany in 1978, but returned to Turkey after a few months. However, after the bloody 1980 Turkish coup d'état, Doğu had to fear for his life and fled to Germany for good. From 1981 to 1988 he lived in the asylum seeker camp in Neuburg an der Donau where he wrote the book of poems Das Lager gleicht nicht den Kerkern Anatolien. Since his asylum application was rejected, he was expecting deportation to Turkey for years, although many German notable people and organizations supported his right to stay. In 1989 he married Lili Schlumberger, then spokesperson of the Bavarian Refugee Council, and moved to Dachau. In 1991, he was recognized as an asylum seeker and received German citizenship in 1997. Cengiz Doğu was active in Germany with readings, civic actions for refugee and human rights, speaking engagements against racism and discrimination, while earning his living as a storage worker. Together with Osvaldo Bayer and Urs M. Fiechtner he developed the documentary short film Asylum (1984). The film was shown at the International Festival of the Film Schools in Munich (Internationales Festival der Filmhochschulen München) and won a prize of the German Film Critics at the International Short Film Festival in Oberhausen (Internationale Kurzfilmtagen Oberhausen). In 1989 Doğu became a member of the \\"Verband deutscher Schriftsstellerinnen und Schriftsteller\\" and later was engaged in the Munich group of the \\"Werkkreis Literatur der Arbeitswelt\\", a writers' group in Germany that not only involved professional but also freelance writers. Doğu also participated in the events at the memorial site of the Dachau concentration camp. Cengiz Doğu died in Dachau after a long illness on November 14, 2019 and now rests at the Waldfriedhof. Poetry Doğu's lyrical poems, prose contributions and book publications in German and Turkish come from his experiences of imprisonment, flight, camp, racial discrimination and exile. People flee \\"when the human hunters begin their chase [ ... ], when the voice of torture takes the place of laughter [ ... ],\\" Dogu wrote in a poem. His poem Why did you flee your country? has been reprinted several times.https://www.ked- nordkirche.de/fileadmin/user_upload/baukaesten/Baukasten_Kirchlicher_Entwicklungsdienst_der_Nordkirche/Dokumente/Judika-2016-Flucht.pdf In 1988 Doğu published bilingual collection of poems Das Lager gleicht nicht den Kerkern Anatolien. In seven years in the collection camp in Neuburg an der Donau, he had created poems in which he sings the sad song of asylum, the longing for home and freedom for his country, but also powerful verses of love, life and death. He opposes the long nights in the camp to \\"the small, wretched cells of the Anatolian dungeons in which humanity bleeds.\\" A forest near the Danube, that he got to know \\"for three and a half years,\\" is also reflected in his further book of poems Neuburg Lieder. Just like the forest, Doğu feels confined to a location and \\"can not change his place.\\" Bibliography=Books * Das Lager gleicht nicht den Kerkern Anatoliens.

The album was unpopular upon release, but has gained a cult following in part due to the mysterious disappearance of Sullivan. While it is commonly known as U.F.O., a 1970 pressing on Century City Records titled the album as simply Jim Sullivan. The album deals with supernatural and extraterrestrial themes, topics that Sullivan was obsessed with. \\"Rosey\\" was released as a single from the album in 1970 on Century City Records. Background The album was released on a private label in 1969 and received little attention at the time. Actor Al Dobbs founded the Monnie record label to press Sullivan's album. The artist enlisted session musician ensemble The Wrecking Crew to help fill out the songs, and it was recorded and released later that year. Sullivan would follow the album with a self-titled release in 1972 before disappearing. The album is notable not only for its obscurity, but also for its lyrics that seem to predict Sullivan's own disappearance. After years of obscurity, Light in the Attic founder Matt Sullivan (no relation) discovered the record while surfing obscure music blogs. He was transfixed by the cover art and Sullivan's voice and eventually got the album repressed on his label in 2010. Record club Vinyl Me, Please partnered with the label in 2019 and repressed the album on colored vinyl as part of their monthly subscription series. If the Evening Were Dawn, an album of compiled demo tracks from the recording sessions of U.F.O. was released on October 25, 2019 by Light in the Attic. Reception As the album was released on a private label, the album garnered little critical attention upon release. Due to the 2010 reissue and the record's hazy history, modern reviews have reappraised the album. James Allen of AllMusic called the album a \\"lost classic\\" and praised the atmospheric and orchestral feel of Jimmy Bond's string arrangements. The Independent wrote that the album has its moments of \\"hippy excess\\" but that much of the material is full with David Axelrod-esque string arrangements and features an essence similar to that of \\"Wichita Lineman\\" Track listingPersonnel Adapted from LP liner notes of the 2010 Light in the Attic reissue. *Jim Sullivan – writer, singer, guitar *Earl Palmer – drums *Lyle Ritz – bass guitar *Max Bennett – bass guitar *Don Randi – keyboards *Lee Kiefer – technician *Jimmy Bond – producer, arrangements, double bass *Peter Abbot – engineer *Al Dobbs – executive producer *Chad Dulaney – executive producer *Norman Skolnik – executive producer External links * U.F.O. on Discogs References Category:1969 albums ","title":"U.F.O.

Spafford taught painting at the University of Washington, Seattle until his retirement in 1994.  Education and early years  Michael Spafford was the middle of three sons of Sarah Alice Maloney and Lynn Spafford, a businessman, and grew up in Greater Los Angeles. He became interested in the Classical myths in his Latin class at Riverside High School, one of his first artworks being a drawing of the Roman underworld based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. Spafford was also interested in cartooning and was able to obtain a part-time job with an advertising agency in Riverside, California while still in high school. After graduating in 1953, he attended Riverside Junior College and then transferred to Pomona College. While at Pomona in 1956, Spafford met Elizabeth Sandvig, who eventually became his wife. Spafford graduated from Pomona magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. Spafford and Sandvig moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Spafford had a full scholarship in art history at Harvard University and Sandvig pursued a teaching certificate in art at Radcliffe College. After a year at Harvard, Spafford decided to pursue his interests in making art rather than studying art history and the couple moved to Mexico City to join Sandvig's mother.  Career = Mexico City  After graduating from Pomona University and studying art history for a year at Harvard, Spafford moved to Mexico City where his mother-in-law lived so that he and Sandvig could live and focus on their art. Here, Spafford was able to study the Mexican mural painters first-hand and was influenced by their portrayals of mythic subjects depicting powerful, often brutal imagery, their graphic, simplified forms and solid colors. Spafford adopted his approach of taking a mythic subject, usually of Graeco-Roman origin, and working out multiple versions with strikingly graphic contrasts. He would work on the same myth over a period of years. In 1962, Spafford and Sandvig had solo exhibitions in Mexico City at the Mexican-North American Cultural Institute. Spafford's portrayal of death was noted as well as his \\"ruthless, hopeless, seared constructions of our time.\\" After the birth of their son in 1963, Spafford accepted a teaching position with the University of Washington School of Art in Seattle, Washington. Two years later, Sandvig's mother joined them in 1965.  Seattle  In Seattle, Spafford earned prizes in both painting and drawing at the 1964 annual Pacific Northwest Arts and Crafts Fair, where the judge was George B. Culler, director of the San Francisco Museum of Art. The novelist, Tom Robbins, then writing for The Seattle Times newspaper, noted that Culler had no trouble awarding first prize to Spafford and that Spafford was \\"one of the few University of Washington professors to display any originality in the annual faculty show\\" the previous winter. Spafford followed this with a solo show at the Otto Seligman Gallery in 1965. Spafford was awarded a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant in 1966. In 1967, at the same annual fair, Spafford's \\"Rape of Europa\\" was ordered to be taken down by the developer who managed the fair's venue.  The Prix de Rome and Italy  In 1967, Spafford won the Prix de Rome fellowship, which included a studio at the American Academy in Rome.In Italy, Spafford began to work larger and adopted key themes from the Roman myths that would inform his work for most of his career, including the myths of Leda and the swan, the twelve labors of Hercules, the fall of Icarus, and the myths around the fall of the Titans and Saturn. Spafford would later point out that living in a foreign culture helped him learn how to see. He also began using diptych and triptych configurations while in Rome.  Public art  Spafford and Sandvig became active in efforts to increase public funding of the arts upon their return to Seattle in 1969. A member of The Artist's Group (TAG), and its president in 1974, Spafford and the group and its allies successfully lobbied for one-percent- for-art legislation that would require one percent of the construction budget of public buildings to be spent on the acquisition and maintenance of art for those buildings. Spafford argued that art is not a decorative frill, but should be considered an essential part of a public building and its design. He argued that to do otherwise \\"is a crime against the people\\". In 1973, Seattle and King County adopted one-percent ordinances. The state of Washington followed in 1974. By 1975, the Seattle Arts Commission had purchased art from 31 Northwest artists under the one-percent ordinance. Spafford's 1980 commission for murals based on the twelve labors of Hercules for the Washington state legislature chambers led to his murals first being covered, then uncovered in 1989, before being removed entirely in 1993 and stored. The murals were eventually installed at the Centralia College Corbet Theatre in 2002 after a decade of negotiations. Spafford's first public art commission was the 1978 King County Arts Commission installation of five images based on the Fall of Icarus (Tumbling Figure -- Five Stages) on the external wall of an elevator shaft of Seattle's Kingdome. The design was executed in 1978, then Spafford took a one-year sabbatical to Mexico. Fabrication and installation were completed after Spafford returned from Mexico in 1979. The Kingdome was demolished in 2000 and Spafford's work was put into storage. In 2004, Tumbling Figure--Five Stages was re-installed on a parking garage facade at 6th avenue and Jefferson Street in Seattle. In 1985, Spafford accepted a commission for the Seattle Opera House, producing a thirteen panel Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, after Wallace Stevens' poem. This time, the work was positively received by both art critics and public.  Later career  Returning from Mexico City in 1969, Spafford resumed his faculty position in the University of Washington, Seattle School of Art, teaching drawing and painting until his retirement in 1993. A large diptych of the Labors of Hercules (1977) was purchased by the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) which led to a retrospective of Spafford's paintings at the Seattle Art Museum in March and April 1982. The labors of Hercules would be a motif Spafford worked on for much of his career, creating over 60 works on the theme, including a 1987 set of woodblock prints which was the first art acquired by the Microsoft Art Collection. In 1983, The American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters awarded Spafford a $5,000 prize in the visual arts and included his paintings and graphic work in an academy exhibit in New York City the same year. Spafford had a large solo exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum in 1986, and another retrospective was held at the Bellevue Art Museum in 1991. The Bellevue Art Museum exhibited the Rape of Europa piece that had been taken down from the Bellevue Arts and Crafts Fair show 24 years earlier. In 2018, Spafford's larger epic works, many of which had not been previously exhibited, and series of woodcut prints were exhibited in a three part exhibition involving three Seattle galleries: the Greg Kucera Gallery, Woodside/Braseth Gallery, and Davidson Galleries.  Style and meaning  Spafford used images and themes found in classical myths to address the human condition. He frequently returned to the myths of Europa, Leda and the swan, the labors of Hercules, the fall of Icarus, and others. Spafford seeks to distill the primal power of these myths through highly re-worked painting, using both subtractive and additive methods to portray the struggle, both in his paint and in his themes, of human life. Seattle-based art critic Regina Hackett wrote: > Michael Spafford abbreviates and freely alters the stories that interest > him, ignoring the convoluted and decorative. What's left are the primary > passions, the excavated pressure points of human consciousness. … Myth is > Spafford's catalyst. He doesn't want to shake the history of rape, romance, > murder, phallus-worship, the pathological underpinnings of the heroic. In > myth, he finds access to the extreme situations that cannot be dismissed as > contemporary aberration. He is after the pause before slaughter, the moment > of cataclysmic fusion …  Personal life  Spafford and his wife, Elizabeth Sandvig, upon receiving his position at the University of Washington in Seattle, moved to the city's Montlake neighborhood.

Early life He was the son of John Atherton of Harvard. His mother was Mary Sawyer (born Sep 11, 1714),the daughter of James Cornet Sawyer and Mary Prescott. His parents had married on May 25, 1735. His paternal great-grandfather was James Atherton (1654-1718) of Lancaster, Massachusetts. His great-great grandfather James Atherton, who emigrated to America, was one of the founders of Lancaster, Massachusetts. He was buried in Sherborn, Massachusetts in 1710. Career Atherton was a blacksmith by trade and was the first to forge steel in Colonial America. He made the first pair of clothier sheers in America. The aftermath of the battle meant that Atherton and his family had to leave the area for their safety. A chronology of his career is below:  Dover Iron Works (1763)  Atherton relocated to Amenia, NY to erect the Dover Iron Works under his superintendency. The works were erected and proved to be a success. He was also a gun maker. In 1769 he relocated temporarily to Boston after entering into a partnership with Samuel Adams, John Adams and John Hancock and experimented for the first time in steel. John Hancock's signature would become the most prominent on the United States Declaration of Independence. Superintendent of the Armory in Boston, Massachusetts (1769) The Massachusetts Convention of Towns sat during September 22–29, 1768. Samuel Adams, and John Hancock, wanted to organize an armed local resistance. In 1769 Atherton left Amenia, NY, for Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he superintended an armoury belonging to John Adams, Samuel Adams and John Hancock and commenced the manufacture of cutlery and firearms. The site was burned down after operating just 6 months by an incendiary, likely to have been placed by British troops who were quartered in Boston, since the colonial authorities suspected their patriotic intentions arming the local population during the time of the Boston Massacre. In 1770 he returned to Amenia and announced in the local paper that he would be serving the Great Nine Partners Patent area. Converting Iron into American Steel (1772) Atherton discovered the process of converting iron into ‘American steel’ He became closely involved in the first large scale production of \\"American Steel\\" in 1772.  Dover Iron Works (1772)  Atherton enters into a contract with James and Ezra Reed, merchants of Amenia, to superintend the erection of steel works, to be constructed by them, and to instruct their workmen in the art of making steel. The works were erected at the site of Dover Iron Works and were subsequently used to produce muskets for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Siege of New York (1775) Atherton played a role in preparing for the siege of New York. In November 1775 Atherton in his role as a gunsmith in Amenia, NY concluded an agreement with Alexander McDougall and Peter Curtenius of the City of New York, acting with authority of the Provincial Congress of the Colony of New York. Steel Works in Amenia, New York (1776) Whilst engaged at the Dover Steel Works, during September, he petitions the New York Council for an exemption from military duty for his workmen, whilst engaged in the manufacture of firearms whilst under his contract with Congress. Cornelius Atherton & the treason of Benedict Arnold (1780) On September 21, 1780, during the American Revolution, American General Benedict Arnold met with British Major John Andre to discuss handing over West Point to the British, in return for the promise of a large sum of money and a high position in the British army. The plot was foiled and Arnold, a former American hero, became synonymous with the word “traitor.” His son Cornelius Jr recounted the incident: > “I was informed by my mother years ago, when I was a young man, that on his > learning the British ship Vulture was anchored in the river below West > Point, my father Cornelius Atherton, with another man (name forgotten) went > to a Colonel Livingston, in command of a small battery , five or six miles > below West Point, asking him to send a small detachment up on the Heights, > and drive the Vulture away, but the Colonel dare not weaken his small force. > He finally gave them a twelve pound carronade and two gunners, with > ammunition a plenty. In a short time they had their gun in position on the > highland banks, within easy range of the Vulture and perfectly safe from her > guns. After trying a cold short a few times without effect they improvised a > furnace and made the balls red hot, and at the first fire struck a red hot > ball in the deck of the vessel. A second and third were equally successful. > She cast her cable and took her way down river, out of the way of the guns > on the heights. This I believe to be a true statement of the cause of Major > Andre’s capture, and saving West Point from falling into the hands of the > British. Cornelius Atherton” Colonel James Livingston of the 1st Canadian Regiment was in command of Verplanck's Point on the Hudson River in September 1780, and played a crucial role in the unmasking of Benedict Arnold's treachery. While on guard duty, his troops fired on the British sloop of war HMS Vulture (1776), forcing that vessel to retreat southwards. This ship had brought Major John André to meet with General Benedict Arnold, who was then in command at West Point, New York. Since the ship was driven off, André was forced to attempt travel by land to New York, when he was captured not far from the British lines near Tarrytown with incriminating papers in his possession. André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold, his plot discovered, managed to escape to the British lines. Return to Pennsylvania (1782) He returns to his family and relocates with them to Keyser Creek. He lived on a hill overlooking the creek. The area today is known as Taylor, Pennsylvania.  Timeline of key events during his lifetime  1750 - The Iron Act was passed with the aim of eliminating the import duty on colonial pig iron.

Atherton had been drafted at the time of the Battle of Wyoming, but his place was filled by his eldest son, Jabez, who volunteered to become his substitute, and was accepted and mustered in as a private.

Discrepancies Some sources state that his first wife was from Tolland, CT. They also incorrectly state that she died in 1774. However she was alive when their oldest son Jebez was killed in the 1778 Battle of Wyoming, although very sickly. Once widowed, Atherton married Jane Johnson. Various obituaries stated that he was the fourth in descent from Major Gen. Humphrey Atherton of Boston. Other discrepancies by late 19th biographers, followed by a submission to the Daughters of the American Revolution in the 20th century refer to Cambridge, Massachusetts, as his birthplace. However contemporary researchers have identified Harvard, Worcester, Massachusetts as his birthplace, due to ease of access to birth and church records. Confusion is likely to have arisen due to his association with both Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, through his work.

Due to accidents claiming in total 26 lives and pollution, the installations were permanently closed in 1956. The mining concession is still active and there is talks into converting it into an open pit mine and demolish the remnants of the Beattie mine. 600x600px  Discovery and prospection  Abandoned mining equipment The credit for the discovery of the Beattie deposit belongs to Mr. John Beattie, who has been interested in the district since 1910. He found gold in small veins in basalts on Beattie island, near the outlet of Duparquet lake, and did a considerable amount of work there, but the showings did not seem to warrant large-scale development. He then turned his attention to the mainland east of the lake, where a body of feldspar porphyry was discovered near the lake and values in gold were obtained. The first zone opened-up at the north was thoroughly drilled by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, but did not prove sufficiently attractive, so their option lapsed. Further work westward, towards the west end of the porphyry' body, opened-up a wider zone in a similar position, and the assays were attractive enough to warrant a new option, which was finally taken over by Ventures Limited. Ventures drilled this new area and obtained indications of a large tonnage of material with values considered to be commercial. The Nipissing Mining Company became associated with Ventures for a 40 per cent interest in the undertaking, and in 1932 a prospect shaft was sunk in the ore to a depth of 220 feet. The results were so encouraging that a major development was at once undertaken for an initial production of about 600 tons per day, with planned gradual expansion to 5,000 tons per day.

A statue of him stood in the centre of Hamilton from 2013 to 2020.  Biography = Early life  Hamilton was born in 1820 in Hildersham, Cambridgeshire, England, where he was christened on 15 July 1821. His parents were Colonel John Potter Hamilton (es) (1778–1873) and Charlotte Hamilton (nee Fane) (1787–1869, a daughter of Oxfordshire farmer and Tory MP John Fane), who married on 28 December 1813. Rear-Admiral Francis Fane (1778–1844) was his uncle.  Naval career  Hamilton joined the Royal Navy on 28 August 1835, presumably as a midshipman. He served in the First Opium War, taking part in \\"the taking of Amoy, the storming of Chinghae, the attack on the Chinese entrenched camp on the heights of Segoan, the capture of Chapoo, and the engagement with the enemy’s batteries at Woosung\\" whilst serving under Captain Thomas Bourchier of HMS Blonde, and in the boat action under Captain George Goldsmith which destroyed \\"10 fire-vessels with which the Chinese had attempted to annihilate the British shipping and transports at their anchorage off Chinghae\\". Although Hamilton passed his examination for lieutenant on 10 November 1841, he then served as Mate aboard HMS Warspite under Captain Provo Wallis and HMS St Vincent (then the flag-ship of Sir Charles Rowley) on the Lisbon and Portsmouth stations. Hamilton was promoted to Lieutenant on 8 March 1844, and subsequently served on the South American Station, aboard (under Captain John Gordon) from 24 May 1844 to 1 August 1844, and then HMS Racer (under Captain Archibald Reed) from 1 August 1844 until the summer of 1846. He afterwards became senior lieutenant of HMS Leander. Hamilton served in the Crimean War as part of the Naval Brigade at the Siege of Sevastopol. He was promoted to Commander on 27 November 1854, and commanded HMS Elk in the East Indies and in China during the Second Anglo-Chinese War. Hamilton was again promoted to Captain on 26 February 1858.  Marriage and children  In 1855, Hamilton married Laura Parry (1831–1918) in Bicester, Oxfordshire, England. Their children included: # Laura Maria Hamilton (1856–?), christened at St Peter in Kent, England, on 14 September 1856; # John Fane Charles Hamilton (1859–1921), born in Belmont, Hampshire on 14 August 1859. He was a Lieutenant Colonel. On 3 June 1890 John married Gertrude Catherine Mary Angela Stuart (1870–1919), eldest daughter of John Stuart, D.L. J.P. of Ballechin, Co. Perth. He served in the Nile Expedition 1884–85, with 1st Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment; retired pay, 1886; Major 3rd and 4th Battalion (Militia) Lancashire Fusiliers, 1894–1898; Hon Lieut-Colonel, 1898; J.P. (1894) Hampshire; C.A. Isle of Wight Club; Naval and Military. According to the England and Wales Census of 1911, 56-year-old John was living in the Isle of Wight. His address was Spencer Lodge, Spencer-road, Ryde, Isle of Wight. Gertrude died in October 1919. John died on 20 November 1921 and was buried with his mother and Gertrude in Ryde Old Cemetery (Section N Plot 1965a); and # Arthur C Hamilton (1862–?), born in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1862.  New Zealand Wars and death  From 22 May 1863, Hamilton took command of HMS Esk (from commissioning in Portsmouth), and was ordered to the New Zealand Wars. Hamilton directly commanded a detachment of the 43rd Regiment and a party of sailors at the Battle of Gate Pā. He was struck in the head by a bullet during the battle and died on 29 April 1864. Hamilton was buried at the Mission Cemetery in Tauranga. The Daily Southern Cross reported on 3 May 1864: > Captain Hamilton wore several mementoes of his gallantry, and the last and > fatal act which distinguishes him as a gallant officer cannot be better > described than in the words of our special correspondent – \\"The General, who > was in the advanced trench of his position, ordered up the supports almost > immediately after the storming party rushed the breach; and the second > division of blue-jackets and the gallant 43rd, led by Captain Hamilton, of > the 'Esk,' advanced with a ringing cheer to the support of the forlorn hope. > They arrived at a critical moment; the storming party exposed to a murderous > fire on all sides, and from hidden assailants beneath, and without an > officer left to lead them, were wavering; part were outside the pa. Captain > Hamilton sprung upon the parapet, and shouting 'follow me, men!' dashed into > the fight. That moment was his last. He fell dead, pierced through the brain > by a bullet, and many of his officers shared the same fate.\\" Hamilton's cousin Robert Thomas Francis Hamilton (1835–1864) was killed during the same battle; he was a captain of the 43rd Light Infantry Regiment.  Legacy  Civic Square in Hamilton The city of Hamilton, founded in 1864 at the end of the Waikato War, was named after him as is Hamilton Street in Tauranga. The Waikato Museum holds Hamilton's sword, medals and belt, which were donated by family members. In 2013 a life-size bronze statue of John was given to Hamilton by the Gallagher Group \\"to celebrate 75 years in business\\". It was produced by Margriet Windhausen and stood in Civic Square, Hamilton. On 12 June 2020, the city council in Hamilton removed the statue of Captain Hamilton at the request of local Māori iwi Waikato Tainui. Local Māori elder Taitimu Maipi, who had vandalised the statue in 2018, has called for the city to be renamed Kirikiriroa.

In the paper, “Exposure to the ‘Dark Side of Tanning’ skin cancer prevention mass media campaign and its association with tanning attitudes in New South Wales, Australia”, it was highlighted that there was a misunderstanding about the side-effects of tanning. Mainly misconceptions about the association of a tan with a healthy lifestyle outweighed the health concerns. The campaign was first aired in the summer of 2007/2008 and was ran during the same seasonal period until the summer of 2010/2011. It “centred on three television commercials (referred to as ‘Girl’, ‘Footy’ and ‘Surfer’, respectively) featuring a range of ‘tanner moments’—scenes that aimed to build personal relevance by featuring actors from the target audience”.

The mountain is situated east of the crest of the Cascade Range, on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Brahma Peak, to the north. Bandit Peak is the ninth-highest peak on Chiwawa Ridge, and other notable peaks on this ridge include Mount Berge, Buck Mountain, Cirque Mountain, Napeequa Peak, and Chiwawa Mountain. Precipitation runoff from Bandit Peak drains west into Napeequa River; or east into the Chiwawa River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35 million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is northwest of Bandit Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Bandit, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

December 2010/January 2011, (PDF; 15,4 MB) which he created by combining sacred texts (by Paul Gerhardt and Christoph von Schmid) with spring melodies by August Harder and Johann Abraham Peter Schulz.  Life  Born in Soest, Eickhoff received his training at the in Soest. In 1829 he came to Gütersloh as a teacher. There he taught at the protestant girls' elementary school in the Kirchstraße; later he became their rector. In this capacity, he was in charge of the school's move to the new school building in the \\"Kökerstraße\\" in 1859 and the merging of the three Protestant elementary schools into the \\"Bürgerschule\\" in 1868. Beside his pedagogical activity Eickhoff was organist of the evangelic congregation at the Apostelkirche, where two years before him had come as a pastor (until 1838). Through Volkening, Gütersloh became a center of the Minden-Ravensberg Lutheran revivalist movement of the 19th century: Baptists, Methodists, sanctification movement, neo-pietism revivalism. Eickhoff's concern for folk Christian songs had grown out of his teaching profession as well as his organist service. By singing atmospheric texts to catchy melodies, images and message of the gospel were to be impressed upon children and families. In 1835 Carl Bertelsmann founded his publishing house at the church square in Gütersloh. One of the first sales successes was the Christian song collection Theomele [gr.-lat. \\"Gotteslieder\\"], published by Eickhoff with the songs he collected or created by combination. Around this time Eickhoff married Bertelsmann's daughter Anna Friederike. The couple had four children, three of whom became teachers like Eickhoff. Eickhoff's songs experienced their real breakthrough through Johann Heinrich Volkening's songbook Kleine Missionsharfe. It was published by Bertelsmann in 1852 and had 82 editions with more than two million copies. In 1873, Eickhoff co-founded the Historical Society in Gütersloh, the forerunner of today's Gütersloh Heimatverein. On the 50th anniversary of Eickhoff's death in 1936, Eickhoffstrasse in Gütersloh was given its name, although it was not named after Friedrich Hermann Eickhoff, but after his sons Prof. (1853-1934) and Prof. Paul Eickhoff (1850-1931).

The band members publicly admitted ignorance of any prior use, both when they had arbitrarily chosen the first name and again with this one, which White called \\"pure privilege\\". As reported by American Songwriter and Rolling Stone, White described the band's token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artist's name: \\"They're using the name because of a Black Lives Matter incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it. It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist\\". A veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the Internet. The band members contacted White the next week to apologize for inadvertently appropriating her name without any research, saying that the Black Lives Matter movement had inspired them to a collaborative attitude. However, they also expressed their intention to move forward with the Lady A name despite White's concern that simultaneous ownership of the trademark would be detrimental to her career. Initially enthusiastic, forgiving, and hopeful, she said \\"We talked about attempting to co-exist but didn't discuss what that would look like\\" reportedly because the band members would not directly respond to that explicit question three times during the conversation or in two contract drafts. Shocked upon receipt of the band's contract draft later that day, she said \\"Their camp is trying to erase me ... and I no longer trust them\\". She soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed, or that her act would be renamed for a $5 million fee plus a $5 million donation to be split between Seattle charities, a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists, and Black Lives Matter. On July 8, 2020, the band filed a lawsuit against Whiterejecting her counteroffer, and affirming the band's right to its own long-standing trademark of the name. The band stated: \\"Today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with Anita White in unity and common purpose has ended\\". On September 15, 2020, White filed a countersuit asserting her claim to the Lady A trademark under common law and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity. She is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand, along with royalties from any income the band receives under the Lady A moniker.https://pitchfork.com/news/blues-singer-lady-a-sues-the-former-lady- antebellum/ Discography Lady A has released five solo albums. * BlueZ in the Key of Me (2010) * How Did I Get Here (2013) * Loved, Blessed and Blues (2016) * Doin' Fine (2018) * Lady A: Live in New Orleans (2020) Reception In 2016, Rick J.

The organization was formerly known as Youth for Miriam, the youth arm of the 2016 presidential campaign of Miriam Defensor Santiago, initially partnering with People's Reform Party, the political party of Defensor Santiago. It envisions to educate and encourage more youth to be involved in civic and public affairs in the Philippines, with adherence to the political philosophies espoused by the highly-decorated jurist and statesperson Miriam Defensor Santiago. The organization is also cited in the Supreme Court decision related to the ouster of Maria Lourdes Sereno as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.  History  Miriam Defensor Santiago Gaining media traction at the height of Defensor Santiago's consistent delivery of tirades against the key people involved with several political scandals in the Philippines on all political sides, particularly the trial of Chief Justice Renato Corona and Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, coinciding with the rolling out of free Facebook access in the Philippines, several independent Facebook pages showing support for the presidential candidacy of Miriam Defensor Santiago in the Philippines started, even when the late Defensor Santiago has made it public her having lung cancer. In an effort to unify the strategies for the presidential campaign, two key people close to Defensor Santiago: Kim Patria (former Yahoo! News contributor, then media coordinator for Senator Defensor Santiago) and Rissa Ofilada (then vice president at Credit Suisse and former chief of staff of Defensor Santiago, specially tapped for the 2016 presidential campaign), reached out to the social media group administrators to aid in the upcoming campaign. On October 16, 2015, Miriam Defensor Santiago filed her certificate of candidacy and the social media groups have started mobilizing their campaign materials on key social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram independent of strategies provided by People's Reform Party. On February 14, 2016, Youth for Miriam was launched, convening the different youth support groups of Defensor Santiago from different parts of the Philippines, with 20 chapters of around 5,000 members in total from all around the world. Around this time, the group also launched the Youth for Miriam Provincial Caravan, which was a public gimmick to campaign for the senator who has limited herself from local sorties. On May 1 2016, YRMPH represented the Defensor Santiago campaign in a forum organized and aired by The Filipino Channel from its former studios at Redwood City, California, catering to the overseas absentee voters in North America. After Defensor Santiago's unsuccessful try for the presidency, the organization has rebranded itself as a youth group in civil society, inspired by the teachings and writings of the then retired senator, and renamed the organization as Youth Reform Movement. Upon the death of Defensor Santiago on September 29, 2016, the organization has served as volunteers for her funeral services, and is in constant partnership and communication with the family of the late senator for other public affairs since. Through the efforts of United States-based law student Angela Bautista, the organization was formally registered into the Securities and Exchange Commission as Youth Reform Movement PH Inc. on August 9, 2017, and is in constant partnership with other youth organizations and university student councils in the Philippines for several conferences, symposiums, and outreach projects, and has since been using the acronym YRMPH in public releases.  Pillar Projects = The Legacy of Miriam Defensor Santiago  With a following of 458,000 on Facebook as of June 2020, The Legacy of Miriam Defensor Santiago is a Facebook page initially organized by founding vice chairperson Paolo Quimbo for the presidential campaign. Upon Defensor Santiago's death, the page has transformed into the organ of YRMPH, presenting the organization's opinion on pertinent issues and current events, with citations of legal doctrines and philosophies espoused by Defensor Santiago through her authored legislative bills, textbooks, interviews, and speeches found on the internet.  Pamaskong Bigas ni Miriam  Pamaskong Bigas ni Miriam is an annual gift-giving project of the late Miriam Defensor Santiago while she was still alive. In 2016, under the leadership of chairperson Rhyan Malandog and core members Ejhay Talagtag and Vincent Agustin, YRMPH formally took over the continuation of the gift-giving project with the help of private donors and other organizations. In this project, the organization deliberates on which impoverished barangays in the Philippines will receive the sacks of rice to be shared with the beneficiaries during December of each year.  Quezon City Youth Reform Congress 2017  The flagship project of YRMPH is the Youth Reform Congress which was first held at the Quezon City Hall on March 4, 2017. The conference was a partnership project with the City Government of Quezon City under Mayor Joy Belmonte. The event was covered by the University of the Philippines' DZUP and When In Manila.  Harana Para Kay Miriam  AFP Chief of Staff Benjamin Defensor, Jr., Jes Dizon, and Dr. Linnea Defensor Evangelista YRMPH held Harana Para Kay Miriam at the Loyola Memorial Park on the late senator's first death anniversary on September 29, 2017. The event was an open-mic night organized by Rissa Ofilada, former Chief of Staff of Defensor Santiago, attended by family and friends of the late senator. Among the featured performers was Jes Dizon, who was known for her impersonations of the late senator in theatre and television skits such as her performances at UP SAMASKOM'S Live Aids and at Sunday PinaSaya on GMA Network.  TALKhang: Human Rights Forum  On November 29, 2017, at the height of the Philippine government's crackdown on illegal drugs came the issues on human rights abuses by the enforcing authorities. YRMPH executed the organization's first of many several university-based conference events, under the helm of Jan Langomez. YRMPH partnered with the student council of the Philippine Women's University, and launched TALKhang which tackled the Philippine Drug War from perspectives of different public sectors. The title of the event was a wordplay on the informal name used to refer to the government's crackdown on illegal drugs which is tokhang.  Quezon Service Cross Campaign  The Official Poster of the Miriam Defensor Santiago for Quezon Service Cross campaign A core member and then California State University East Bay communication instructor Julius Fernandez rallied the organization through a Change.org petition page to lobby at the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives for the posthumous conferment of the Quezon Service Cross to Defensor Santiago in 2017. The Senate quickly moved for the nomination, securing majority of votes for the conferment with the leadership of Senators Grace Poe and Sonny Angara. The Quezon Service Cross is the highest national recognition of the Republic of the Philippines, necessitating concurrence of both houses of Congress and approval of the President. The awarding ceremony was held at the Malacañang Palace on December 3, 2018, attended by the Youth Reform Movement.  Mumshie on Fire  At the height of the Quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno and with consideration to favorable words and praise delivered by the late Senate Defensor Santiago towards Maria Lourdes Sereno, YRMPH, under the leadership of Paolo Quimbo and Julius Fernandez, invited then Chief Justice on-leave Maria Lourdes Sereno to speak at the forum held at the University of the Philippines Diliman on May 5, 2018. The event was entitled The Mumshie on Fire: Speak Truth To Power in an effort to boost awareness of the quo warranto issue among younger generations who have been exposed to the Filipino slang word mumshie, meaning mother, and to make the event more informal amid having a guest of such stature.  Paskong Manileño  Paskong Manileño is a joint project of YRMPH with the City Government of Manila under Mayor Isko Moreno, and the University of the East-Sandigan sa Silangan organization catering to the elderly. It was a project coordinated by Vincent Agustin, held on December 21, 2019 at the Home for the Aged-Luwalhati ng Maynila facility.  BOOsina  While in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine government prioritized the revision of the Human Security Act, gaining considerable amount of dissent from religious and civil society groups espousing civil liberties and human rights. The revised law, entitled \\"Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020\\" has already merited Congressional approval in both houses by the time that YRMPH, as initiated by its vice chairperson Paolo Quimbo and core member Julius Fernandez, planned to execute the #BOOsina (a wordplay on 'boo' and the Filipino word busina, which means 'automobile horn') campaign - an invitation for Filipinos to honk their horns for 12 minutes on June 12, 2020, coinciding with the commemoration of the Independence Day while practicing physical distancing prescribed for health reasons. The main location was at the University of the Philippines Diliman. The protestation occurred amidst stern warnings from the Department of Justice on the prohibitions for mass gatherings. Former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno joined the #BOOsina campaign.

Initiated by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, it was Indonesia's first bilateral free trade agreement. Since 2013, Indonesia has requested a review of the terms of the agreement, and negotiations are currently underway. Agreements The agreement contained clauses related to free trade of goods and services between the two countries through the removal of tariffs, while adjusting investment regulations to attract Japanese investors to Indonesia. It also covered specific topics such as intellectual property, customs procedures, and energy/mineral resources. The agreement also allowed some Indonesian nurses to work in Japan. History A trade agreement between Japan and Southeast Asian countries (including Indonesia) had been floated as an idea by then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during his visit to Jakarta in January 2002, when he briefed Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Further talks were conducted between the two when Megawati visited Tokyo in June 2003. Following a brief interruption due to the 2004 Indonesian presidential election which saw Megawati's replacement with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the agreement's progress continued in December 2004 when both countries agreed to form a \\"study group\\" to explore a potential free trade agreement. Findings of the study group were published in May 2005, and it recommended negotiations to be conducted in parallel with the agreement between Japan and the ASEAN. A joint communique following a meeting by Yudhoyono and Koizumi on 2 June 2005 announced the initiation of negotiations. By November 2006, both governments announced that an agreement has been reached \\"in principle\\", though the seventh and final round of negotiations would only occur in June 2007. Japan's cabinet approved the terms of the bilateral agreement on 10 August, and the agreement was signed on 20 August 2007 in Jakarta. The treaty came into force on 1 July 2008. It was Indonesia's first bilateral free trade agreement. Renegotiations As part of the agreement, a general review is mandated within five years, and the Indonesian government called for one in 2013. Starting in 2015, both countries agreed to renegotiate the terms of the agreement, with the Indonesian side (under President Joko Widodo) intending for Japanese investors to increase investments in Indonesian infrastructure. Negotiations continued throughout 2018 and 2019, with an initial target of completing negotiations by the end of 2019. As of January 2020, negotiations still continued on a renewed agreement.

History and location The Flushing neighborhood of the borough of Queens in New York City, is one of the largest and fastest growing Taiwanese enclaves outside Asia. Main Street and the area to its west, particularly along Roosevelt Avenue, have become the primary nexus of Flushing's Taiwanese community. However, this community continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration in the 1980s. Flushing originally started off as Little Taipei or Little Taiwan due to the large Taiwanese population. Due to the dominance at the time of working class Cantonese immigrants of Manhattan's Chinatown including its poor housing conditions, the more affluent Taiwanese population could not relate to them socioeconomically and settled in Flushing. Later on, when other groups of non-Cantonese Chinese, mostly speaking Mandarin started arriving into New York City, like the Taiwanese, they could not relate to Manhattan's then dominant Cantonese Chinatown, as a result they mainly settled with Taiwanese to be around Mandarin Chinese speakers. Later, Flushing's Chinatown would become the main center of different Chinese regional groups and cultures in New York City. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. However, ethnic Chinese, including Taiwanese, are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone. Mandarin Chinese, commonly spoken by Taiwanese, has becom the lingua franca] in New York City's ethnic Chinese communities. Elmhurst, another neighborhood in Queens, also has a large and growing Taiwanese community. Previously a small area with Chinese shops on Broadway between 81st Street and Cornish Avenue, this new Chinatown has now expanded to 45th Avenue and Whitney Avenue. Since 2000, thousands of Taiwanese Americans have migrated into Whitestone, Queens (白石), given the sizeable presence of the neighboring Flushing Chinatown, and have continued their expansion eastward in Queens and into neighboring affluent and highly educated Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島). Facilitating migration from Taiwan to New York City is China Airlines, which flies non-stop between Taipei Taoyuan International Airport and JFK International Airport in Queens.

The chronicles were compiled by the Namgyal dynasty, mostly during the 17th century, and are considered to be the main written source for Ladakhi history. The Ladakh Chronicles are one of only two surviving pre-19th century literary sources from Ladakh. Only seven original manuscripts of the chronicles are known to have existed, of which two survive to the modern day. History August Hermann Francke, whose translation became widely used for studying the Ladakh Chronicles. Until the early 19th century, European historians believed that there were no written histories from Ladakh. After reports about its existence, Alexander Cunningham found the first known manuscript of the chronicles (Ms. Cunningham) during his stay in Ladakh in 1847. Cunningham had the manuscript translated into Urdu, but only reproduced part of it in English in his works; Cunningham did not consider the story after the end of the 17th century to be important, so he omitted the remainder from his works. In 1866, Emil Schlagintweit published a study (Die Könige von Tibet) about the Ladakh Chronicles, based on another manuscript (Ms.S.). This was followed by missionary Karl Marx whose studies and translations of a third manuscript (Ms.A.) were published posthumously in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal between 1891 and 1902. The first publication of the Ladakh Chronicles summary of the 1684 Treaty of Tingmosgang appeared as an appendix to a book by Henry Ramsay. In 1926, Tibetologist August Herman Francke published a revised translation and the first detailed history of Ladakh, based on five manuscripts of the chronicles (Ms.S, Ms.A, Ms.B, Ms.C, Ms.L). Francke's edition then became the standard edition for future studies on the pre-Dogra Ladakhi dynasties. In the later part of the 20th century, research on the Ladakh Chronicles were complemented by further studies by Luciano Petech and Zahiruddin Ahmad. Known manuscripts There are seven manuscripts of the Ladakh Chronicles that are known to have existed: * Ms.S Bodleian Library in Oxford, Ms.Tibet, C.7.: This manuscript belonged to the former King of Ladakh and was stored in the library of the sTog palace. The original manuscript has since disappeared, but its contents were copied in 1856 and later published by Emil Schlagintweit. * Ms.A: This manuscript only covers the history up until the reign of Sengge Namgyal (r. 1616–1642). The original manuscript no longer survives but its text was partly published and translated by missionary Karl Marx. * Ms.B: This manuscript consists of only four pages about the Namgyal dynasty and its conquest by the Dogra dynasty of Jammu and Kashmir. The original manuscript no longer exists. * Ms.C: This manuscript was compiled at the end of the 19th century by Munshi dPal-rgyas and includes three appendices about the Dogra conquest. The original no longer exists. * Ms.L British Museum, Oriental Collection 6683: This manuscript covers Ladakhi history until the reign of Deldan Namgyal (r. 1642–1694) and also contains a plain list of subsequent rulers until the Dogra conquest. * Ms.Cunningham: This manuscript covers the history from the reign of Tsewang Namgyal I (r. 1575–1595) until at least the reign of Delek Namgyal (r. 1680–1691). The manuscript was partially translated into Urdu for Alexander Cunninhgam during his stay in Ladakh in 1847, who included a partial English version in his works, but the original manuscript and its Urdu translations no longer exist. * Ms.Sonam: This manuscript consists of approximately 40 pages and covers the entire history of the two Ladakhi dynasties until the Dogra conquest. The manuscript is a modernized and shortened version of Ms.C until events c. 1825, after which it contains extra details that are not covered by the other manuscripts. Its owner also added appendices and minor changes not originally contained in the manuscript, and it is known to be in the private possession of a 'Bri-guh-pa monk at the Lamayuru Monastery. Contents A. H. Francke. The border between Maryul and Guge is shown with a thin dotted line, slightly to the north of Gartok; the border between Maryul and Zanskar is marked by a bolded line, slightly to the west of Leh. The Ladakh Chronicles were split into several separate sections, with the Royal Genealogy of Ladakh being the principal chronicle. The chronicles refers to several dynasties of kings, mentioning that some were descended from the mythological Tibetan hero Gesar. Tibetans controlled the area since 663 and was controlled by the Tibetan Empire until 842, after which the area was described by the chronicles as splintering into several principalities plagued by warfare and raiding. The chronicles then describe the establishment of Maryul by descendants of the central Tibetan monarchy in the 10th century. The chronicles describe the period of conflicts with the Mughal Empire during the late 14th to 16th centuries in Ladakh and Baltistan. The chronicles then describe the development of the Namgyal dynasty and its expansion to Purig in the west and the Tibetan lands of Guge in the east. The latter parts of the Ladakh Chronicles in manuscripts Ms. C and Ms. Sonam contain details about the surprise Dogra invasion of Ladakh. The chronicles also cover the first- millennium presence of Buddhism, the growth of Buddhism in the first half of the second millennium, and the introduction of Islam in the 16th century.  Treaty of Tingmosgang (1684)  Monastery of Tingmosgang The Ladakh Chronicles mention that the Ganden Phodrang Prime Minister Desi Sangye Gyatso of Tibet and the King Delek Namgyal of Ladakh agreed on the Treaty of Tingmosgang (sometimes called the Treaty of Temisgam) in the fortress of Tingmosgang at the conclusion of the Tibet–Ladakh–Mughal War in 1684. The original text of the Treaty of Tingmosgang no longer survives, but its contents are summarized in the Ladakh Chronicles. The summary contained in the Ladakh Chronicles includes six main clauses of the treaty: #A general declaration of principle that the region of Guge (mNa'-ris-sKorgSum) was divided into three separate kingdoms in the 10th century; #The Tibetan recognition of the independence of Ladakh and the restriction for the King of Ladakh from inviting foreign armies into Ladakh; #The regulation of trade, subdivided into two subclauses, for Guge and the northern plain of Tibet (Byaṅ-thaṅ); #A clause fixing the Ladakh-Tibet border at the Lha-ri stream at Demchok, but granting the King of Ladakh an enclave at Men-ser; #Another clause regulating Ladakh-Tibet trade; #The arrangement of a fee to Mi-'pham dBaṅ-po (then-regent of Ladakh) for his cost in arranging the treaty. The trade regulations provided for Ladakh's exclusive right to trade in pashmina wool produced in Tibet, in exchange for brick-tea from Ladakh. Ladakh was also bound to send periodic missions to Lhasa carrying presents for the Dalai Lama. The fee in the sixth clause was later paid by Desi Sangye Gyatso to Mi-'pham dBaii-po in the form of three estates in Tibet sometime between the autumn of 1684 and 1685. Historiographical issues The origin, intent, and time of the authorship of the Ladakh Chronicles is unknown to modern historians. The chronicles have also been criticized for containing gaps and inconsistencies, as well as for lacking geographical details. Its existing translations, particularly concerning the Treaty of Tingmosgang, have also been called \\"patchwork\\".

Watkins Johansson is an American neuroscientist and psychiatrist and Associate Professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as well as the Director of the Sheppard Pratt Memory Clinic in Neuropsychiatry in Baltimore, Maryland. Johansson was the first Black female Meyerhoff Scholar to obtain an MD/PhD from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. During her MD/PhD she developed a novel treatment for gastrointestinal in patients with diabetes that led to a patent for a pharmacological compound in 2000. Johansson is a practicing neuropsychiatrist with a focus on geriatric psychiatry and she conducts brain imaging research as well as research on cancer in African American women.  Early life and education  Johansson was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. She wanted to become a doctor from a young age. She attended public school in Baltimore City and became the first Black president of the student government at Dulaney High School in Cockeysville. During high school, she completed an internship through the Nursing Program at Johns Hopkins to begin to explore the field of medicine. In 1991, Johansson attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) for her undergraduate education. She was supported by the Meyerhoff Scholarship Program which is a competitive program that funds the undergraduate degrees of underrepresented minorities at UMBC. She majored in biological sciences and was interested in diabetes research since her grandmother had diabetes. Johansson graduated in 1995 with a Bachelors of Science. After completing her undergraduate degree, Johansson pursued her MD/PhD training at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. During her PhD training, she worked in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience under the mentorship of Solomon H. Snyder, whom she met as an undergraduate at UMBC. She became a Society for Neuroscience Fellow, an Academic Medicine Fellow of the National Medical Fellowships and Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc. Her thesis was titled “Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide: Novel Neurotransmitters in the Enteric Nervous System”. For her graduate work, she explored the mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with diabetes. She found that in mouse models of diabetes, there is a significant reduction in neuronal nitric oxide synthase mRNA and that insulin treatment restores the nNOS levels. Further, the delay in gastric emptying can be reversed with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, sildenafil. Her PhD work led to a patent for a drug to treat neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes and the work was covered in the Wall Street Journal. Johansson completed her MD/PhD in 2003, becoming the first female Meyerhoff Scholar to obtain an MD/PhD. Johansson was also one of only three Black women at the time to graduate with a doctorate in molecular and cellular neuroscience from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Johansson continued her medical training at JHU, pursuing her residency training in psychiatry. She completed her Internship at Sinai Hospital at Johns Hopkins in 2004, and then went on to complete her residency training in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in 2008. During her residency, she became the Chief Resident of Psychiatry and also completed her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Martin G. Pomper using the novel Positron Emission Tomography ligand, TSPO, to visualize neuroinflammation in the human brain. She then completed a fellowship in Mood Disorders and Neuroimaging at Johns Hopkins in 2009. She then completed another Fellowship in Geriatric Psychiatry in 2011.  Career and research  In 2011, Johansson became an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. In 2014, she became the Director of the Sheppard Pratt Memory Clinic in Neuropsychiatry and has since been promoted to Associate Professor at JHU. As a clinician and a professor, Johansson treats patients, conducts clinical research, and educates the future generation of physicians. Johansson is actively involved in advocacy, mentorship, and education. She co-founded a literacy program for youth and teaches adolescents about preventing teen pregnancy. She is also on the ABRCMS Steering Committee which hosts the largest professional conference for underrepresented students. On the clinical side, Johansson volunteers with the Adolescent Depression Awareness Program which educated high school students, teachers, and parents about adolescent depression. She has been featured on several news broadcasting networks such as WBALTV, The Maryland Daily Record, The Baltimore Sun, WYPR, Science Magazine, and ConscienHealth.  HIV/AIDs medical service and research  Johansson has been committed to educating communities and patients about HIV/AIDs prevention as well as conducting research on the psychological and neurological complications of the various stages of infection. She worked with the Ministry of Health in Ghana to implement HIV/AID health education and prevention programs. In the laboratory and the clinic, Johansson has explored the severity and prevalence of the neuropsychiatric complications of HIV infection that remain regardless of antiretroviral therapy due to the harboring of virus in microglia and astrocytes in the brain. Based on the infection of glial cells in patients with HIV, Johansson has also conducted studies exploring the extent of neuroinflammation in patients with HIV using Positron Emission Tomography with the PET ligand TSPO. The positive signal associated with the TSPO ligand is thought to be correlated with increased glial cell activation. She found that there were white matter abnormalities in patients with HIV on combination antiretroviral therapies compared to controls and white matter abnormalities increased in patients that also had HIV associated dementia.  Psychological coping strategies and disease progression  As a neuropsychiatrist, Johansson treats memory loss and provides geriatric psychiatry services. She also explores how psychiatric or psychological dysfunction relates to cancer and systemic disease progression and recovery, with a focus on African American women, who are understudied in clinical research. She has found that African American women suffering from breast cancer and undergoing chemotherapy treatment benefit from comprehensive psychological care programs in terms of coping capacity and distress associated with disease. She has also explored how chemotherapy affects daily life in African American women.

Liu Chen (劉晨) and Ruan Zhao () were semi-legendary figures active during the Han dynasty, known for their trip to Tiantai Mountain. First described in the early fifth-century zhiguai anthology Youming lu (), the legend of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao has been depicted in paintings, plays, and poetry. Synopsis The legend of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao was first described in the zhiguai anthology Youming lu (), whose authorship is attributed to Liu Yiqing (403–444). It is recollected in the Taiping Yulan. In the fifth year of the Yongping Emperor, Shengzhou natives Liu Chen (劉晨) and Ruan Zhao () head to Tiantai Mountain to procure medicinal herbs, whereupon they encounter a couple of beautiful maidens in a valley of peach blossoms. They cohabit with them but begin to feel homesick after half a year. However, Liu and Ruan return home discover that hundreds of years have elapsed after meeting their seventh- generation grandchildren. In the eighth year of the Taiyuan reign of the Jin dynasty, Liu and Ruan disappear again, this time apparently forever. Depictions Painted on a Cizhou ware pillow, dating back to the Jin dynasty and currently housed at the Palace Museum in Beijing, are \\"two gentlemen crossing a bridge and walking towards a cloudy ravine\\"; according to scholar Li Qingquan, the two men are Liu and Ruan. The Yuan dynasty playwright Wang Ziyi () adapted the story into a play titled Liu Chen Ruan Zhao wu ru taoyuan or Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao Strayed into the Land of Peach Blossoms (). Yuan painter Zhao Cangyun's \\"most famous painting\\" is on the handscroll Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao Entering the Tiantai Mountains (), which has been on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art since September 1999; the handscroll also features inscriptions by Zhao and is accompanied by colophons by Zhao Heqin (), Hua Youwu (), Yao Guangxiao (), and Song Yong (). Allusions The previously unpublished autobiographical account of Zhang Daye's (1854–?) life during and after the Taiping Rebellion—whose manuscript was rediscovered and translated into English by Xiaofei Tian as The World of a Tiny Insect in 2013—begins thus: Tian writes that Zhang's \\"deliberate discursive choice\\" of evoking the legend of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao with the phrase \\"trip to Tiantai\\" serves to create an \\"ironic reversal of the idyllic, if legendary, past\\"; moreover, while Zhang did pass by the mountain, his final destination was his friend Yuan Jichuan's residence in Shaoxing.

The historical name of the place is Tirupparialur. The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Ilam Kobanayal. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished Daksha. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam. Legend Legend of Daksha's Yagna and Sivaganas destroying it As per Hindu legend, Dakshayani (also called Sati), the daughter of Daksha, married Hindu god Shiva. Daksha organised a huge Yajna, invited all the demigods and sages, and intentionally avoided Shiva and Dakshayani. Daksha yajna was an important turning point in the creation and development of sects in Hinduism. It is the story behind the 'Stala Purana' (Origin story of Temples) of Shakti Peethas. Dakshayani wanted to meet her sisters and father, though her father had not invited her husband. Shiva discouraged her from attending the event as an uninvited guest, but she persisted and attended the event. Daksha insulted her and her husband in front of the guests. She was insisting on dedicting the havirbhaga, the prime offering of the yajna to her husband, which Daksha refused. She was unable to bear the insult, ran into the sacrificial fire and immolated herself. Shiva, upon hearing the terrible incident became furious and invoked Virabhadra and Bhadrakali by plucking a lock of hair and thrashing it on the ground. Virabhadra and the Bhoota ganas marched south and destroyed all the premises of Daksha, who was decapitated. Daksha's wives were pleading with Shiva, upon whose request Shiva forgave and brought him to life by attaching a goat's head. The Yajna was allowed to be completed in the presence of all demi-gods and sages. The place came to be known as Dakshapuram (place of Dakhsan) and since Shiva destroyed the wrongdoings of all the celestial deities for attending the yagna in his absence, it came to be known as Pariyalur (pari in Tamil means taking away). Architecture Gopuram of the temple The temple is located in Pariyalur, a village away from Sembanarkoil in Mayiladuthurai - Tharangambadi road. The temple faces south and has a five-tiered rajagopuram. The sanctum houses the image of Dakshipureeswarar in the form of lingam and on the walls of the sanctum, there is a sculptural panel where Daksha is depicted worshipping Shiva. The lingam is square in shape and believed to be selfformed. The sanctum has ardhamandapa before it and a Mahamandapa, the worship hall. The Mahamandapa houses the metal image of Dakshasamharamurthy sported with six hands holding six different weapons. There is a metal plaque at the footsteps of the utsava image indicating Brahma starting the yagna of Daksha. The Mahamandapam also houses other metal images of Murugan, Somaskanda, Vinayagar and Pradoshanayagar. The shrine of Ambal in the form of Ilangodiamman faces west. The image is sported in standing posture with four hands. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines in the temple are enshrined in rectangular granite walls. The five-tiered rajagopuram is a recent addition to the temple. The temple does not have the Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities, but just Surya, the Sun god. The temple is administered by Dharmapuram Adheenam.  Religious significance  It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Tirugnanasambandar. As per legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury. The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Korukkai or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. Tirugnanasambandar describes the feature of the deity as:Tirugnanasambandar Tevaram, I: 134:9 Festival and religious practices The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Kalasanthi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Amritaghateswar and Abhirami Amman. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. There is a temple procession during the Sundays of the Tamil month of Karthigai.

Sculpted by Martin Jennings, the statue was executed in 2016. It honours Mary Seacole, a British-Jamaican nurse who established a \\"British Hotel\\" during the Crimean War and who was posthumously voted first in a poll of \\"100 Great Black Britons\\".  Subject  Mary Seacole (née Grant, 1805–1881) was born in Jamaica to a Scottish father and a Jamaican mother. Following her mother as a \\"doctress\\" practising traditional herbal medicine, and as a hotel keeper, Seacole established a mess, the \\"British Hotel\\", at Balaklava during the Crimean War. Travelling to the Crimea independently after her attempts to join the official nursing contingent led by Florence Nightingale were unsuccessful, Seacole set up the hotel as a recreational and convalescence facility for officers and men and was referred to as \\"Mother Seacole\\" by the soldiery. Returning to England in 1856, she published an autobiography, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, the following year. Falling into poverty, Seacole benefited from fundraising efforts supported by a number of illustrious backers, including the Duke of Wellington and the war correspondent of The Times, William Howard Russell. After her death in 1881, Seacole largely disappeared from the public consciousness. The centenary of her death saw the beginnings of a revival of interest; the Mary Seacole Memorial Association was founded in 1980, and an English Heritage blue plaque commemorated her residence in George Street, Westminster. In 2004 Seacole was voted first in a poll of 100 \\"Great Black Britons\\", and the president of the Royal College of Nursing called for the erection of a statue to honour her memory. Over a decade later, and following considerable controversy, the statue in the gardens of St Thomas' Hospital was unveiled by Floella Benjamin on 30 June 2016.  Description  The statue stands in the gardens of St Thomas' Hospital, facing the Palace of Westminster. The figure of Seacole is cast in bronze and the sculptor Martin Jennings depicted Seacole in motion to represent her \\"marching defiantly forward into an oncoming wind, as if confronting head-on some of the personal resistance she had constantly to battle\\". The sculpture stands on a plinth of Cumbrian slate with Portland stone dressings. Seacole stands in front of a disc, again cast in bronze although with a lighter patina to accentuate contrasts and shadows, which shows the land surface where Seacole established her \\"British Hotel\\" in the Crimea. Jennings intended the disc to have both literal significance, as a depiction of the place where her reputation was first established, and symbolic meaning, as a block to her ambitions. The plinth carries two inscriptions. To the front is carved Seacole's name, occupation and dates, together with words from her autobiography; \\"Wherever the need arises on whatever distant shore I ask no higher or greater privilege than to minister to it\\". The reverse describes the meaning and purpose of the disc, and carries words by William Howard Russell, the newspaper correspondent who covered the Crimean War, and Seacole's contribution; \\"I trust that England will not forget one who nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and succour them, and who performed the last offices for some of her illustrious dead\\". In 2017 the sculpture was shortlisted for the Marsh Awards, established by the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association to raise awareness of Britain's monument heritage. Seacole's statue is generally considered to be the first in Britain to recognise a named black woman.  History  The idea for a statue to commemorate Seacole was raised in 2004, when she topped an online poll to identify 100 Great Black Britons. Her victory led the then President of the Royal College of Nursing, Sylvia Denton, to call for the erection of a commemorative statue. The idea was supported by the London M.P. Clive Soley, who had become interested in Seacole when a group of black women from his constituency, who had served in the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service, approached him for help in identifying and refurbishing Seacole's grave in St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green in West London. Soley subsequently became chair of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal which undertook a twelve-year campaign to raise the necessary funds to pay for the statue. Over £500,000 was raised in private donations, and this was supplemented by the granting of £240,000 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who diverted fines levied following the Libor banking scandal for the purpose of landscaping and preparing the statue's site. The commissioning of the statue generated controversy. Opposition was led by the Nightingale Society, and its co-founder Lynn McDonald, the editor of the 16-volume Collected Works of Florence Nightingale. The society's main objection was to what it perceived as the embellishment of Seacole's work and reputation, to the detriment of that of Florence Nightingale. The proposed site for the statue, the grounds of St Thomas', provoked particular hostility, as Seacole had no connection to the hospital while Nightingale had founded her school of nursing there in 1860. In 2013 the controversy became linked to, ultimately unsuccessful, efforts by the then Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, to remove mention of Seacole from the English schools National Curriculum. The statue's sculptor, Martin Jennings, noted the substantial length of time it took to raise the necessary funds, contrasting it with the more usual period of around two years, and asked, in an interview in The Guardian newspaper in 2016, \\"would there really be such energy behind the[..] resistance if the person the statue honours was white-skinned\\"? By 2016, work on the statue, cast in the foundry of Pangolin Editions in Gloucestershire, and on its site, was complete. The statue was unveiled on 30 June 2016 by Floella Benjamin. Speaking at the unveiling, Elizabeth Anionwu, Emeritus Professor of Nursing at the University of West London and vice-chair of the appeal committee, referenced the importance of the site and of the statue itself; \\"There are not enough statues of women, let alone of black women. St Thomas’ are proud to host the statue of Mary Seacole both in recognition of the work done by their black and minority ethnic healthcare staff, and also because of the diverse community they serve\\".

History  The former coal-fired power station of Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke (HEW) was commissioned on 17 January 1917 with a nominal output of 20,000 kW. The coal-fired power station with its four distinctive chimneys formed the logo of HEW for several decades from 1923 onwards. The construction of the power plant was started in 1914. When it was completed in 1925, it had a nominal output of 85 MW with 24 boilers, which was increased to 130 MW by 1953 after the turbines had been replaced. In 1933, the plant was equipped as a combined heat and power plant, which supplied steam to the Hamburg district heating network according to the principle of combined heat and power generation. In 1950, the plant was modernised into a high- pressure power station. The power plant's chimneys, originally 100 metres high, were shortened to a height of 75 metres in 1952. From 1984, a combined heat and power plant with hard coal firing was built next to the power plant on an area washed up with sand from the North Elbe, which went into operation in 1993. In the same year the old power station was shut down and demolished by the mid-1990s. The new power plant has been in operation since the takeover of HEW by Vattenfall Europe Heat. On the site of the coal-fired power plant, an additional 125 MW combined-cycle gas turbine power plant was commissioned in 2009, which burns natural gas. The gasometer deep stack built in the 1930s was demolished in 1986.  Deactivation 2030  The Tiefstack power plant is to be shut down by 2030. It has not yet been clarified how the City of Hamburg intends to replace the Tiefstack combined heat and power plant. One alternative would be to use the industrial waste heat from companies in the Port of Hamburg, including the copper producer Aurubis, the aluminium producer Trimet Aluminium and the steel group ArcelorMittal. Thermal recycling of waste is also considered an option. Other sources report that the Tiefstack power plant is to be replaced by an \\"energy park port\\" with a gas-fired power plant, which is to be located south of the Elbe.This energy park port is to replace not only the Tiefstack power plant, which will be shut down by 2030 at the latest, but also the 60-year-old Wedel power plant, which will be shut down in 2025.

Image taken at Station C2 of the Apollo 14 landing site. Rock width is about 1.5 m. The fillet is characterized by an onlap contact with the adjacent rock and by a shallow or concave profile. Associated morphologies are thin pockets of dust present on top of the boulder and rock fragments either laying on top of, or buried by, the fillet. These rock fragments are chipped off from the original boulder by impacts of large meteoroids.  Origin  The preliminary scientific report of Apollo era indicate that two processes, not mutually excluding, can be responsible for the development of fillets: 1) Deposition of material eroded from the boulder itself by the abrasive action of micrometeoroids, and 2) deposition of ejecta material from distant impact craters against the side of the boulder.

Sikta Irrigation Canal during construction Project Development The feasibility study of the project was done by Lahmeyer International GmbH from Germany in 1980. In 1983, the Department of Hydrology and Metrology revised the study. In 2004, the Irrigation Development Programme under the European Union concluded that the project is feasible which led the government to start the project by its own resources. The initial project cost in 2005-06 was NPR 12.8 billion and estimated to be completed by 2014-15. The project is still under construction and is estimated to be complete by 2020. The project is expected to rise to NPR 25.02 billion. In 2019, the project completion was 60%. The contractor for construction is CTC Kalika Joint Venture Pvt Ltd. The project targets to irrigate 42,000 hectares of land in Banke District. Damages and Accidents * In 2016, a canal section collapsed due to weak soil properties during testing at the flow of 5m3/s. * In September 2017, damages were reported in multiple section of the canal. The damage was due to cross-drainage problem in the canal. Most of the damage were found near the siphon areas. *In 2018, damages in canal were reported during testing. Corruption The national Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has lodged a corruption case of over NPR 2 billion in this project. The case was filed against former minister and chief of Kalika Construction Bikram Pandey over the construction of a canal and 20 other staffs.

It recounts the rise of the East India Company in the second half of the 18th century, in the backdrop of a crumbling Mughal empire and the rise of regional powers.  Overview  The book deals with the history of the East India Company in the Indian subcontinent, beginning with the humble origins of the East India Company, founded in 1599 when it received a royal charter awarding them a monopoly on all trade between England and Asia. By the end of the first half of the 18th century, they had established bases in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. The main part of the book deals with the territorial conquests, starting from the Battle of Plassey in 1757, which results in the conquest of Bengal, the richest province of Mughal India. By the end of 1803, they have gained control over the entire subcontinent and command a large private army. Dalrymple draws from known sources and previously untranslated or unknown sources like the Shah Alam Nama, a biography of Shah Alam II, the Mughal emperor during most of the events.  Reception  The book has received positive reviews. Maya Jasanoff of The Guardian notes that the book is an \\"... energetic pageturner that marches from the counting house on to the battlefield, exploding patriotic myths along the way.\\" Tirthankar Roy writes in the The Times Literary Supplement that \\"...he is a terrifically good storyteller. He makes the reader see how events unfold and observe the personalities up close. He is widely read both on the primary sources and the historical scholarship. As a result, The Anarchy is one of the best books on Indian history published in a long time.\\" M Saad of Scroll notes that \\"It is an achievement in itself that he has adroitly dealt with a work of such proportions. Dalrymple writes with a mastery in which he has few equals among his contemporaries. He is known for narrating the most dreadful of all historical events with a certain grace unique to his writing.\\" Mukund Padmanabhan writes in the Hindu that \\"In his familiar passionate manner, Dalrymple cuts through the stodge that pervades a lot of writing on history to serve up a book that has it all — the compulsive pull of a thriller, the erudition of a significant piece of non-fiction, and the loveliness of a piece of literature.\\" Madhumita Mazumdar writes that The Telegraph \\"The Anarchy remains a unique meditation on corporate avarice told with the deftness of a scholar and the charm of a raconteur.\\" The book was long listed for the Baillie Gifford Prize 2019.

It was dedicated to Christian Louis I, Duke of Mecklenburg and printed in Würzburg by Johann Gottfried Schönwetter. It was a description, with building instructions, of a measuring device called the pantometer, that Kircher had developed some years before. The first edition include 32 copperplate illustrations. Description of the pantometer The name \\"pantometer\\" derives from Greek, in which \\"pan\\" means \\"all\\" and \\"metron\\" means \\"measure\\" - indicating that this instrument can be used to measure anything. As described in the book, it consisted of a square frame, a dioptra, and a disc that fitted within the square. The disc contained a built-in compass and a space for putting a sheet of paper. The disc could turn freely within the square, or be locked in a fixed position. Mounted on this apparatus was a movable ruler parallel to the edge of the square on which the dioptra was attached. An illustration in the book showed how the device could be used to measure the distance of objects by triangulating from two different points on a baseline. The introduction to the book emphasised both the accuracy of the device and its ease of use, and stated that it could be used to \\"measure all, witness latitudes, longitudes, altitudes, depths and surfaces, terrestrial and celestial bodies, and whatever indeed we are accustomed to doing with other instruments.\\" Kircher's development of the pantometer Kircher had mentioned the pantometer in his Specula Melitensis Encyclica noting that it was designed to help the Knights Hospitaller to solve \\"the most important mathematical and physical problems.\\" It was a surveying tool that resembled a draughts board and could be used to calculate distances, weights and dimensions. In Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica (1643) Kircher has described an \\"Instrumentum, Pantometrum, Ichnographicum Magneticum\\" which allowed all things to be measured. It was 'magnetic' because it incorporated a compass, and 'ichnographic' because it could be used in map- making. According to Schott, Kircher had first conceived of it in the company of father Ziegler, perhaps as early as 1623. Schott has been with Kircher in 1631 when he had first assembled the instrument and named it the 'pantometrum', sending an early example to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. Kircher had certainly used the pantometer himself to take scientific measurements when he was lowered into the crater of Vesuvius in 1638. Later editions and references Pantometrum Kircherianum was reprinted by Cholinus in Frankfurt in 1668 and again in 1669. The work was referenced in books by a number of later writers, including Jacob Leupold's Theatrum Arithmetico- Geometricum (1727) and Christian Wolff's Mathematisches Lexikon (1747).
