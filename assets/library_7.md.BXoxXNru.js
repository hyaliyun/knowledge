It premiered in the ACID section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and played in competition at the 2016 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, where it received the Jury Distinction award. Plot The Devil appears to a miller and offers to make him rich if he sells him \\"what is behind your mill\\". The miller returns home to find liquid gold flowing through his mill, but discovers that his daughter had been behind the mill, playing in an apple tree. After years of luxury, the Devil reappears to collect the young girl, but finds her too clean to take. He orders the family to confine the young girl to the apple tree, guarded by dogs which then maul her mother to death when she tries to help her. When the Devil returns, he finds that the young girl had kept her hands clean. He angrily orders the miller to cut off her hands, and the young girl consents. Even then, the young girl makes her arm stumps clean with just her teardrops, and the Devil still cannot collect her. The young girl angrily chooses to leave the mill. After wandering the forest, the young girl finds pears growing in a garden. She tries to reach them, but is unable to cross a strong-flowing river to get to them. The goddess of the river rescues her and takes her to the garden, telling her that a prince owns the garden. The prince and his gardener servant welcome the young girl to their castle. Eventually, the prince and the young girl fall in love, with the prince giving her two prosthetic hands made of gold as a wedding gift. The prince has to leave to lead his army to war, leaving the now pregnant young girl in the gardener's care. She gives birth to a healthy son, though she finds her golden hands useless in handling the baby. The gardener sends the joyful news to the prince, but the Devil replaces the message with a note saying she had given birth to a monster, instead. The prince sends a reply saying that he still stands by the young girl and their son, but the Devil changes that message, as well, to a note ordering the execution of the young girl and her son. Appalled, the gardener lets the young girl and her son escape, instead, handing her a bag of magic seeds. The young girl follows the river to its source, where the goddess tells her of an abandoned house where they can live. The young girl and her son prosper in the house, living off the food grown from the seeds. She abandons her useless golden hands in the river. The prince finally returns after losing the war. The gardener initially pretends to have carried out the executions, but then tells the truth when the prince tells him that he never wrote that message. The prince then sets out on a quest to find the young girl and their son. After many years, he finds the mill, finding that her father ultimately hanged himself, and finding the remains of the young girl's hands. He also finds the golden hands in the river, and follows the river to the house. Still thinking he wants to kill them, the young girl attacks the prince with an ax, only to realize that she now has new hands to hold the ax. The prince explains that the note was fake, but just then, the Devil in a raven form attacks their son. He then morphs into a pig form he had used all through the film. The young girl uses the ax to kill the pig, and the Devil finally gives up on trying to take her. The prince and the young girl decide to stay neither in the house nor the castle, but for the family to find new adventure.

Biography  The son of academics, Louis Leschi followed himself an exemplary curriculum whose beginnings were interrupted by World War I. After his admission to the √âcole Normale Superieure in 1919, he obtained his agr√©gation of history in 1922. He then was a member of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome from 1922 to 1924. During this period of training, he followed the courses of Ren√© Cagnat and J√©r√¥me Carcopino. It was during his stay in the French school in Rome that he was sent to Algeria to St√©phane Gsell and found his vocation of archaeologist specializing in ancient Algeria. He was appointed a professor in high school in Algiers until 1932. He was then also associated to the research conducted by Eug√®ne Albertini and gave classes in 1926 at the Faculty. When Albertini was appointed to the Coll√®ge de France in 1932, Leschi succeeded him at the direction of the Department of Antiquities of North Africa. Leschi also succeeded him and St√©phane Gsell, as a teacher at the Faculty of Algiers, but only as detached high school teacher, his lack of doctoral thesis preventing him to get the chair of the Faculty. Dividing his time between teaching and intense activity in the context of his archaeological responsibilities, Leschi ultimately never supported his thesis. That did not prevent him from becoming a renowned scholar and exert a profound influence on the development of archeology in Algeria. In 1932, he was a member of the board of the Algerian Historical Society of which he became vice president in 1944. In 1942, he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. He died of illness in 1954 without being able to publish an expected account on ancient Numidia.  Work  From 1923, Louis Leschi left many scientific articles on archeology and epigraphy, some of which were taken up in a posthumous volume published in 1957. In addition to his articles in Comptes rendus des sc√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (CRAI) and M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome (MEFR), he published reports on Algerian archeology in the Revue africaine from 1933 to 1953. He also wrote large public works and archaeological guides, including one devoted to the site of Cuicul. He took part to the edition of the . His action as director of the antiquities service was marked by several important initiatives. With Colonel Baradez, he was the organizer and initiator of the practice of aerial archaeology in North Africa. In 1949 he supported the creation of a prehistoric anthropology laboratory at the Bardo National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography. Among many operations as part of his service, he particularly supervised the excavation of Hippo Regius led by M.E. Marec, followed those of Tebessa and Djemila, accompanied closely those of fort Timgad led by Godet. Leschi planned to publish a volume on the Byzantine fort. He led the excavations in Lambaesis where he discovered the first Roman military camp. He was one of the creators of the journal Libyca and contributed to the formation of many archaeologists including Pierre Salama.

Guests who collaborated in the first album \\"Simulakrum Lab\\" were: * Claudio SimonettiClaudio Simonetti (composer, together with Goblin, of many Dario Argento‚Äôs movies soundtracks) who was keyboard player in track \\"Aggregat 4\\"; * Fabio Pignatelli (bass player, former Goblin member, known for Profondo Rosso and Suspiria soundtracks) who played bass guitar in track \\"Backlit\\"; * Kenneth Johnson (maker, producer and director of many TV series, including Visitors, Bionic Woman, The Incredible Hulk and Alien Nation) who was the voice in track \\"The Day The Vocoder Stood Still\\"; * Liz Enthusiasm (singer for the U.S.A. synth-pop band Freezepop ) who performed vocals in \\"Quiet Girl\\" and \\"Far Worlds\\". The first album was produced and arranged by Paolo Prevosto in collaboration with the Italian electronic artist Eugene, who also performed lead vocals on many of the tracks. The music project concept uses advanced research technology with 1970s sound paradigms, inspired by electronic music pioneers such as Kraftwerk, Goblin and Moroder. The tracks are based almost exclusively on original analog synthesizers from the 70s, Moog, Korg and Doepfer, avoiding as much as possible the use of emulated computer synthesizers. The core of Simulakrum Lab is the balance between old school electronic music and groundbreaking future sound engineering. The first album also containing two songs inspired by lost cosmonauts, titled: \\"Lost Cosmonauts\\" (a radio transmission fiction) and \\"Far Worlds\\", the lyric recounts and describes the sensations of a cosmonaut aboard his space capsule during an orbital flight. The first work made by Simulakrum Lab was the remix of the song ‚ÄúSpecial Effects‚Äù by Freezepop in 2012. Subsequently, they released the first album titled Simulakrum Lab for the A5 label in 2013.

She was one of the principal architects of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act which was the consequential legislation under Article 21-A of the Indian constitution that made education a fundamental right for every child in India. She retired as Secretary, Department of Justice, the highest ranking civil servant in the Ministry of Law and Justice.  Career = Education  Between 2006‚Äì2012, she served in the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development. During this period, she coordinated the passage and implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (Right to Education Act) as well as the successful constitutional law defence of the Right to Education Act before the Supreme Court of India. She had previously served as Secretary, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), an autonomous organisation of the Government of India where she led efforts in the process of social deliberation for the National Curriculum Framework 2005 (NCF). The NCF set out what should be taught to children in India and how. In the 1990s, as Project Director of the World Bank funded District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) (1996-1999) and Secretary, Department of Education in the Government of Karnataka (1999-2000), she played an important role in bringing the Nali Kali (or joyful learning) approach to learning to Karnataka's primary schools. Developed with UNICEF assistance, the Nali Kali strategy adopted creative learning practices in a joyful, affirming, non-threatening environment that helped improve enrollment, particularly of girls, in rural primary schools in the State of Karnataka. Earlier in her career, she had served as Director of the National Literacy Mission (1988-1992) where she advocated reforms and implemented the highly successful district-based Total Literacy Campaigns across India. The Total Literacy Campaigns started in 1989 in Ernakulam district and was founded on the principle of wider public participation linking elected representatives in local bodies, district administration and voluntary agencies to create an upsurge of people's participation for achieving the goal of eradicating illiteracy from the district.  Other career highlights  In her last posting with the Government of India, as Secretary, Department of Justice, she facilitated the passage of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2014 (NJAC). The NJAC was enacted to bring about transparency in the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary in India. Earlier in her career, as Director, Women and Child Development, Government of Karnataka (1993-1995) and around the time of the passage of the landmark 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, she initiated training programmes for women elected local body members encompassing cross sectoral issues of health, education, water and sanitation and common property resources. Later, as Director General of three institutes in Karnataka: the Administrative Training Institute (ATI), State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) and State Institute of Urban Development (SIUD), she carried this initiative forward in conceptualising and implementing a large-scale, participatory, satellite-based training programme which reached out to more than 80,000 elected representatives of local bodies in Karnataka.

Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described it in 1836 in the fifth volume of his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis as Eurybia decurrens, from material collected by Allan Cunningham in the vicinity of the Lachlan River. The species name decurrens \\"decurrent\\" is derived from the leaf base running down the stem. The plant is a woody shrub growing to high and wide. New growth and stems are covered in resin. The bright green oblanceolate leaves are alternately arranged along the stems, and are long by across with pointed tips. Flowering takes place from December to June, the daisy-like flowers having a yellow disc and 3-5 white rays. They are arranged in panicles. The slender seeds are cylindrical, tipped at one end by a tuft with 35 to 50 filaments. Olearia decurrens is found across inland Australia, from Dubbo and Brewarrina in New South Wales, westwards across Victoria and South Australia and into Western Australia. It grows in Mallee and Mulga scrub, on stony or sandy soil in the former plant community and sandy loam or calcareous soils in the latter. Seldom seen in cultivation, Olearia decurrens is drought- and frost-tolerant. It grows best in sunny or part-shaded locations with good drainage. Pruning prevents plants from becoming too spindly or leggy.

History  The company started as a user group founded in 1990 by Boris Siegenthaler in the Canton of Geneva, offering a bulletin board system to its members. In 1994, Siegenthaler and fellow developer Fabian Lucchi opened the Siegenthlaer & Lucchi computer store in the Genevan suburb of Ch√¢telaine. They offered low-cost, custom-built computers ‚Äì acting as an alternative to the larger distributors available at the time. The same year, the pair purchased a modem and 64 kbs line, becoming the first privately owned Internet service provider in the canton (after CERN and the University of Geneva). From 1995 on and for a few months, the store offered complimentary internet access to all customers who purchased a computer with them. In May 1997, Infomaniak became a fully-fledged ISP with the creation of TWS Infomaniak SA ‚Äì the company developed its offer based on low-cost internet access and web-hosting services alongside its staple of computer equipment retail. On 1 January 1998, the Swiss state monopoly on telecom services came to an end and new providers were allowed onto the Swiss market. Sunrise, a joint-venture between Tele Danmark and BT, started offering free internet access services, forcing the company to revise its strategy: in 1999, TWS Infomaniak was reincorporated to create Infomaniak Network. They specialised in web-hosting services for private users and small and medium- sized enterprises, including basic.ch, the first Swiss web radio. By 2003, Infomaniak was the largest web-host in Western Switzerland, and by July 2005, it was the largest web-radio broadcaster in Western Switzerland and France. In 2007, the company created and launched their sustainability charter. As a result, it implemented a number of key measures including joining an ethical pension fund on behalf of its employees, a commitment to sustainable travel, and donating 1% of its annual revenue to a range of NGOs. In 2010, the company created a subsidiary ‚Äì Infomaniak Entertainment ‚Äì marking the company's expansion into the ticketing, staff, and accreditation-management. Infomaniak's main business remains as a webhost and registrar. In 2011, the company announced that they managed more than 100,000 domain names. They opened their third data centre in 2014. As with all their facilities, the new data centre was fully sustainable ‚Äì using 100% renewable energy and low- voltage technologies. The centre was heralded as the \\"greenest there is in Switzerland\\" with a PUE under 1.1 which won the company the Geneva sustainability prize. A few months later, Infomaniak obtains its ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certifications for environmental and energy management systems. Infomaniak fully switched to SSD technology at the end of 2015. The latest figures from the company suggest that it managed more than 200,000 domain names, 150,000 site, and 350 radio/TV stations in 2016. It has also become one of the first web companies to implement the new Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates. According to CEO Boris Siegenthaler, Infomaniak's customer base is composed of businesses (70%) and individuals (30%), small to mid-sized businesses representing a significant portion of sales. Around 30% of customers come from France and Belgium, and as of 2016, the company had 60 employees.

Stretched along Vermont Route 15 south of Browns River, which powered the village's industries for many years, the village center includes a well-preserved array of 19th and early 20th-century buildings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The village of Jericho was established in the early 19th century around a series of mill privileges on the Browns River, which in the first half of the 19th century were mainly populate by saw and grist mills. Beginning in the 1820s the mills expanded to include woolen textile processing, and in the later 19th century the water power was harnessed for a variety of manufacturing operations, established to capitalize on the areas natural resources. The water-powered industries declined in the early decades of the 20th century, and most of the industrial buildings were torn down or destroyed by fire or flood. Fires also occasionally swept through the built-up areas of the village, but significant elements of its 19th-century form still predominate. with The historic district stretches along Vermont Route 15, which is known as Main Street in the western portion and Church Street in the eastern portion of the district. These two roads meet at a small triangular green, from which Lee River Road and Plains Road extend south. The western boundary of the district is roughly Lawrence Heights, and its eastern boundary roughly Griswold Street. In addition to buildings lining Church and Main Streets, the district includes properties on Lee River Road, Plains Road, and Old Pump Road, and it includes the archaeological remains of the mill complexes on either side of the Browns River, which roughly parallels VT 15. Most of the buildings are wood frame structures, with the brick Congregational Church (1826) and Galusha House (1790) as prominent exceptions. The village's industrial past remains visible in the Old Red Mill and Mill House (aka the Chittenden Mill), located at the western end of the historic district and now a museum property of the local historical society.

As of 2010, it attracts 700,000 visitors a year. History The park opened on Labor Day in 1990 after a protracted political fight. Then-County Executive O. James Lighthizer later said that getting the park open was \\"the toughest political fight in my 16 years of politics,\\" but that it was worth it because after it opened, \\"everybody in the community, no exceptions, loved it.\\" The land where the park now sits was purchased in early 1986 by developers who planned to build 250 luxury homes. When neighboring communities found out about this, the city of Annapolis and Lighthizer intervened, and the land was purchased by the county on October 30, 1987. Some in the community felt that the land should be left untouched, but a plan for a park modeled after Druid Hill Park in Baltimore and Central Park in New York City was put in motion. The park cost $12 million to develop, surpassing the original estimate of $8 million.

Its role is to promote and facilitate human rights work by politicians who usually spend most of their time dealing with matters that affect their local constituency.  History  PHRG was founded in 1976 by Eric Lubbock, Lord Avebury, after he was encouraged to concentrate more on international human rights by Martin Ennals, the then director of Amnesty International. Avebury was Chairman of PHRG until 1997 when Labour MP Ann Clwyd took over. Avebury remained Vice-Chair of PHRG along with Jeremy Corbyn MP until his death in 2016. The organisation is currently run from Clwyd's office with funding from the Barrow Cadbury Trust. The organisation undertakes activities such as writing briefings for UK attendees at the Inter-Parliamentary Union and organising meetings in Parliamentary committee rooms on diverse thematic and country-related human rights situations. They have held meetings on subjects ranging from statelessness to Dalit rights and undertaken country visits to Pakistan to report on the situation of the Ahmadiyya community. The Human Rights Handbook (1979) stated listed situations which PHRG had advocated on in its first three years to include 'the abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union; human rights violations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile; human rights and the Press; Namibia; human rights and the UN...' In December 2015, Clwyd stated in an article for Amnesty International that the UK should remain committed to the international human rights framework. This came at a time in which there was a growing perception that the British government, especially after the narrow Conservative victory in the 2015 General Election, had de-prioritised human rights as part of the work of the Foreign Office. Sir Simon McDonald, Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office admitted to a Commons committee in 2015 that human rights work \\"was secondary also to the need to promote British companies abroad\\", according to The Independent. Following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2015 and the death of Lord Avebury in 2016, new members such as SNP MP Margaret Ferrier joined the group.

It is located in the parish of Saint Andrew, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. at the top of Edinboro road, on Berkshire Hill, just west of the town. Standing at 601feet above the sea level, it is the major early 19th century fortification in Saint Vincent. The fort enjoys a panoramic view of the Leeward side of the island, including Kingstown, Young Island, the Caribbean, Bequia and the Grenadines. On a clear day, Grenada 90 miles to the south, can be seen (using binoculars of course.) Origins On re-taking the island in 1763 from the French, the British commenced the building of the fort with interruptions, see the Wikipedia article on Saint Vincent (Antilles) for an in-depth history. Construction started in 1763 and was completed by 1806. Saint Vincent (Antilles). In its heyday, it supported 600 troops and 34 guns. Some cannon are dated 1811. It was built to protect against French attack, Carib unrest, and slave rebellion. The British garrison were to use it for holding out against any French invading forces while the Royal Navy brought reinforcements from other islands. The British had learnt a lesson when the French invaded the island at Calliaqua in 1779 thus proving that any likely attack on the island would come from any location, rather than directly on Kingstown itself or from the sea. Consequently, the fort was built as a redoubt accessed by a viaduct; with its cannon pointing inland. The fort was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, the wife of King George III. Recent history Fort Charlotte At various times the fort was used as a poor house, Leper colony, and mental hospital. These institutions were housed in now ruined Barracks facing the Kingstown harbor, at the bottom of the hill. The fort served as the Vincentian prison. The main barracks building housed a women‚Äôs prison capable of holding 50 prisoners, commonly held up to 15 prisoners closed in mid 2015. The dry moat was used as the women prisoner‚Äôs exercise yard. Some of the old barracks (the officers‚Äô quarters) now house a small museum with a colourful painted history of the Black Caribs or Garifuna. Lighthouse The fort is the home of the Fort Charlotte Light, which acts as a beacon for the entrance to Kingstown Bay, it gives off three white flashes every 20 seconds. The Coastguard radio station and harbour signal station are based here too. Other local fortifications Fort Duvernette and Young's Island from Calliaqua Fort Duvernette, also known locally as Rock Fort is now a ruin, although there are still cannon there pointing out to sea. It is located on Duvernette Islet, immediately to the south of Young Island. The islet is a volcanic plug of hard columnar basalt, and rises 195 foot out of the sea. Wilkie‚Äôs Battery, is the sister fortification to Fort Duvernette. In the late 1800s the building was converted into the Villa Estate‚Äôs cotton drying-house, and later into a private residence in the 1940s. In 1964 it was converted into the Grand View Beach Hotel. The French built these two forts prior to giving up occupation of the island to the British in 1763. This was at a time when Calliaqua was the commercial hub of the island. Both fell into disrepair once the construction of Fort Charlotte commenced.

It was initially founded in 1913 as Wa Ying College and transformed into the current school in August 1955. During the Cultural Revolution, the school was once called Shuibengchang Middle School of Foshan (Simplified Chinese: ‰ΩõÂ±±Ê∞¥Ê≥µÂéÇ‰∏≠Â≠¶) but restored afterward. Currently, the school has 75 classes. From Grade 10‚Äì12, each grade has 24 classes. The Junior High School Department of Tibetan Students has three classes. The total number of students is approximately 3400 and the number of full-time teachers is about 250. The school is the only regular boarding senior high school directly subordinates to Foshan Education Bureau. It is also one of the Exemplary Schools accredited by MOE.  History = Qing Dynasty (1853-1911)  Traditional Buildings in Foshan No.1 High School In 1853, the South China diocese of British Methodist Church established its first church and an affiliated school in Guangzhou. After that, several schools were established by the church in Guangdong. In 1909, Rev. S. George Tope, a priest of the church purchased 20 acres of land in Wenchangsha, Foshan for school establishment.  Republic of China Ôºà1911-1949Ôºâ  In 1912, the Methodist Church began to establish a school on the purchased land. In 1913, the construction was completed. The first principal was Rev. James Richard. In memory of Dr. Haigh's contribution to Chinese Education, the school was first named \\"Haigh College\\". Soon after its opening, the name was changed into \\"Wa Ying College\\" (), which indicates that the school represents a combination of Chinese and British Education (in Chinese, \\"Wa\\"ËèØ means China and \\"Ying\\"Ëã± means Britain). At the time, the school recruited male students only. In 1920, Rev. Arthur H. Bray (Èªé‰ºØÂªâ), the second principal of Wa Ying Middle School, raised money for expanding the school and building a new school recruiting female students. The new girl school was established in 1923. During the World War II, the school underwent significant changes. The boy school and the girl school were combined due to the shortage of schoolhouses. In order to avoid the Japanese invaders, the school has moved to several places including Hong Kong, which laid a foundation for the establishment of Hong Kong-based Wa Ying College (ËèØËã±‰∏≠Â≠∏) in 1969. After the war, Wa Ying Middle School moved back to its original site in Wenchangsha, Foshan and re-opened in November 1946.  People's Republic of China (1949-today)  After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Wa Ying Middle School was confiscated by the government and transformed into the current public school \\"No.1 Middle School of Foshan\\". At first, the school was a public junior and senior high school with students from grade 7 to 12. In 1999, the junior high school department was separated from the school and became an independent junior high school called Foshan Huaying School. Since then, Foshan No.1 High School has only had students from grade 10-12 (except for Tibetan Department). In October 1995, the school was assigned to open a Junior High School Department of Tibetan Students (also called Tibetan Department) by MOE. Students recruited from Tibet attend the school during grades 7‚Äì9. On December 8, 2013, the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. The school gate on the 100th anniversary day.  Campus and Buildings  The campus area of Foshan No.1 High School is about 200 acres and the floor area is about 112,600 „é°. Sports Center The buildings in the campus can be categorized into traditional type built in Wa Ying Middle School era and modern type built in No.1 High School era. The modern type includes the administrative building, library, main teaching building (west area), comprehensive building (east area), art building, sports center (new gym), auditorium (old gym), and students' dormitory buildings. The traditional type includes old principal office, old library (also known as \\"coffin alley\\" Ê£∫ÊùêÂ∑∑, now it has become alumni center), the white house (now foreign teacher dormitory), the red house (now female teacher dormitory), bell tower (now school clinic), old teaching building (now dining hall staff dormitory), and old dormitory building (now male teacher dormitory). Due to their century-long history, these traditional and historical type buildings are all under the legitimate protection from the government. Other infrastructure in the school includes one 400m stadium, two swimming pools, 10 outdoor basketball courts, six computer laboratories, 10 physics laboratories, 10 chemistry laboratories, 10 biology laboratories, and eight lecture halls.

The company was founded by Jan Willink, a textile producer from Winterswijk, who had created the Borken - Winterswijk - Zutphen railway in 1878.  Creation  On August 9, 1879, the Dutch laws on local railways and tramways were enacted. They facilitated the creation of cheaper railway networks throughout the Netherlands by addressing a number of requirements including staffed signal boxes. According to the new legislation, train speed could not exceed 30 km/h. This enabled the laying of lighter and cheaper rail. The construction of local railways began due to the request local textile producers who required a railway between Winterswijk, Groenlo, Eibergen, Neede, Haaksbergen, and Hengelo / Enschede. A committee was created that sought to ensure the development of a railway to Enschede. This railway had to create a connection to the Ruhr. The line joined to two already-existing lines servicing Germany in Winterswijk. On June 18, 1881, Jan Willink created the GOLS network, which would service two main lines and two branches: Stationsweb.nl: GOLS * Winterswijk - Hengelo ** Boekelo - Enschede * Winterswijk - Zevenaar ** Doetinchem - Ruurlo MijnGelderland.nl: Spoorlijn van Ruurlo The lines Winterswijk-Hengelo and Ruurlo-Neede were opened on October 15, 1884. The line between Winterswijk and Zevenaar opened on July 15 of 1885 but quickly lost popularity among the textile producers. On December 7, 1885, a connection between Boekelo and Enschede was created bringing the total length of the GOLS network to 131 kilometers.  Exploitation  The servicing of trains was outsourced to the Staatsspoorwegen (SS). They ran services on the newly opened Betuwelijn railway between Elst and Rotterdam and could have potentially connected to the GOLS-network creating a valuable connection between Rotterdam and Enschede. Willink arranged a deal with the Staatsspoorwegen in 1882 enabling them to immediately purchase five new steam trains. This caused the Dutch Government to assume the SS would get too much market share in the railroad industry. Instead, the exploitation of the GOLS lines was outsourced to the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij. The Staatsspoorwegen did not approve of this measure and barred the GOLS from using its network. This led to the creation of new GOLS stations in Zevenaar and Winterswijk.  The end of GOLS  The Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg- Maatschappij (HSM) had plans to purchase the GOLS since 1893 but never succeeded. In 1920, the HSM was given approval from the Dutch government to purchase the Eschede - Oldenzaal line, and six years later, the HSM took over the first line in the province of Twente, the Almelo - Salzbergen, which led to two railroad companies having a shared monopoly over twenty railroads. Competition decreased further and ended with the fusing of both companies into Nederlandse Spoorwegen. the GOLS line Winterswijk - Enschede/Hengelo was closed in 1935 when they did not bring in enough profit. Cargo transport between Haaksbergen and Enschede continued until 1972, after which the Museum Buurtspoorweg (MBS) took over the line. Ever since 1974, the MBS has been operating the line between Haaksbergen and Boekelo. The only other former GOLS line still in use today is the line Winterswijk - Doetinchem - Zevenaar, which is currently used by Arriva and Breng.

Biography  Born into a modest family of Valence in the Dr√¥me department where his father ran a machine shop, Fernand Courby experienced from childhood the taste to translate through drawing the expression of his thought. A brilliant student in high school in Valence, then a scholarship holder for license and aggregation at the Faculty of Arts of Lyon, he was formed by the teaching of Henri Lechat Maurice Holleaux and Philippe-Ernest Legrand and chosen to be a member of the French School at Athens in 1905. After a stay at the Acad√©mie de France in Rome (Villa Medici), he joined the great archaeological sites of Delos and Delphi under the leadership of Maurice Holleaux. An archaeologist coupled with a designer and very expert in architecture, he realized the then so rare type of archaeologist-architect that was missing in the French School at Athens, and contributed to a capital change in French methods in archeology.Hellmann, Marie-Christine. Les architectes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Ath√®nes. In Bulletin de correspondance hell√©nique, Volume 120, livraison 1 (1996),(pp. 191-222). At Delos, he became interested in 1906 in the proto-history of the sanctuary, unearthed the Portico Antigone with one of the tombs of the Hyperborean Virgins (the Theke), and discovered the remains of a Minoan and Mycenaean Delos in the sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis.Courby, Fernand.

The service officially launched on January 5, 2016, as Beam, under the ownership of co- founders Matthew Salsamendi and James Boehm. The service carried an emphasis on interactivity, with low stream latency and a platform for allowing viewers to perform actions that can influence a stream. The service was acquired by Microsoft in August 2016, after which it was renamed Mixer in 2017, and integrated into Microsoft's Xbox division (including top-level integration on Xbox One). In 2019, Mixer gained attention when it signed two top streamers from its main competitor Twitch ‚Äî Ninja and Shroud ‚Äî to a contract with the service. However, citing an inability to scale its operations, Microsoft announced on June 22, 2020, that Mixer would be shut down by the end of July 22, and that an agreement had been made with Facebook for monetized channels to join similar programs on Facebook's game streaming platform. Microsoft officially shut down Mixer on July 22, 2020.  Features  Mixer used a low- latency streaming protocol known as FTL (\\"Faster Than Light\\"); the service states that this protocol only creates delays of less than a second between the original broadcast and when it is received by users, rather than 10‚Äì20 seconds, making it more appropriate for real-time interactivity between a streamer and their viewers. In addition, viewers can use buttons below a stream to interact with it, including voting, special effects, and influencing gameplay. Some interactions required users to spend \\"Sparks\\" ‚Äî a currency accumulated while viewing streams. An SDK was available to integrate games with this system. In November 2018, the site unveiled a major update branded as \\"Season 2\\", including features launching immediately, and plans for upcoming features. The update added automatic quality adjustment to the player, and \\"Skills\\"‚Äîa feature that can be used to trigger special animations and effects in chat. Some premium skills are purchased using the paid currency \\"Embers\\"; channels can receive revenue from Embers spent by their viewers. Partnered streamers can also receive payment bonuses based on the volume of Sparks spent on their channels. In April 2019, Mixer added \\"Channel Progression\\"‚Äîa level system for tracking users' engagement with a particular channel over time. Users can receive benefits to reward their long-term participation. Mixer‚Äôs features also included CATbot, an auto chat filtration bot that helped remove unwanted chat content on streamers‚Äô channels before chat ever saw it. CATbot‚Äôs moderation level could be adjusted for all viewers or could be set according to viewers‚Äô rank in Channel Progression. Users could also purchase subscriptions to individual channels that are Mixer partners, which allowed access to exclusive emoticons, and adds a badge to their name in chat commemorate their support. Initially, these were priced at US$5.99 per month. In October 2019, Mixer announced that the price would be lowered to $4.99, matching the price of subscriptions on Twitch.  History  The Mixer booth at the 2018 Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle Beam launched on January 5, 2016. In May 2016, Beam won the Startup Battlefield competition at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, receiving $50,000 in equity-free funding. On August 11, 2016, Beam was acquired by Microsoft for an undisclosed amount. The service's team was integrated into the Xbox division. On October 26, 2016, Microsoft announced that Beam would be integrated into Windows 10. Beam broadcasting was also integrated into Xbox One on the March 2017 software update. On May 25, 2017, Microsoft announced that Beam had been renamed Mixer, as the previous name could not be used globally. The re-branding came alongside the introduction of several new features, such as the ability for a user to co-host up to three other streams on their channel at once, as well as the companion mobile app Mixer Create. It was also announced that Mixer would receive top-level integration within the Xbox One dashboard, with a new tab curating Mixer streams. On July 31, 2019, video game streamer Ninja announced that he would move exclusively from Twitch to Mixer beginning August 1. The deal was considered to be a major coup for Mixer, as Ninja had been among Twitch's top personalities, with over 14 million followers. His wife and manager Jessica Blevins stated that the contract with Twitch had encumbered his ability to \\"grow his brand\\" outside of gaming, and that his interest in streaming had been deteriorating due to the perceived \\"toxic[ity]\\" of Twitch's community. A report by Streamlabs and Newzoo reported that in the third quarter of 2019, Mixer had a 188% quarter-by-quarter increase in the amount of unique hours of content being streamed on the service, but that the percentage of concurrent viewers had fallen by 11.7%. Mixer founders Boehm and Salsamendi both left Microsoft in October 2019. The same month, streamer Shroud also entered into an exclusivity agreement with Mixer, followed shortly afterward by KingGothalion. On June 22, 2020, citing a poor market share and inability to scale in comparison to competing services, Microsoft announced that Mixer would be shut down on July 22, 2020. As part of an agreement to collaborate with Facebook, Inc. on aspects of its xCloud cloud gaming service, Mixer redirects users to the Facebook Gaming service after it ceased operations, and partnered streamers offered opportunities to join equivalent Facebook Gaming programs where applicable. Outstanding subscriptions and Embers were converted to Microsoft Store credit. Mixer's intellectual property and staff will be transferred to the Microsoft Teams division, and incorporated into the product. Attempting to visit mixer.com now results in a redirect to Facebook Gaming. Microsoft released its contracts with exclusively-signed streamers; in August, Ninja held a stream on YouTube before returning to Twitch, while Shroud re-signed exclusively with Twitch.

Around 1930 she and her partner Betty Scott set up the architectural practice of Aiton & Scott. Their best-known work is the office building for the Aiton & Company pipe manufacturing company in Derby. This was remarkable both as a striking early example of modernist industrial architecture and also as a building designed by two of the small number of women working in architecture at that time.  Family and education  She was born in London on 13 June 1903, the daughter of Adriana Wilhelmina n√©e Stoop, a Dutch citizen before her marriage,'Golden Wedding of Sir Arthur and Lady Aiton', Derby Evening Telegraph, 24 October 1945, p4 and John Arthur Aiton, later Sir Arthur Aiton, an engineer who founded a steel pipe manufacturing company and became a prominent citizen in Derby where he established his business.

She went to Girton College and passed Part 1 of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 1923The Times, 15 June 1923, p9 but did not complete the course after winning a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) scholarship to study at the relatively new Cambridge School of Architecture from 1924 to 1926.The Times, 23 Oct 1924, p16 She went on to the Architectural Association School (AA), studied there until 1929 and got a RIBA diploma. There she met Betty Scott, her future business partner. The AA curriculum did not yet include modernism but Aiton was aware of continental modernist design, having made several trips to the Netherlands, including a summer working in the office of PJH Kuypers. In 1933 she married Nicolaas Tollenaar, an insurance broker with Sedgwick, Collins & Co, a Dutchman who became a British citizen in 1934.‚ÄòLady Architect Weds‚Äô, Derby Evening Telegraph and Derby Daily Express 19 January 19, 1933 p1London Gazette: naturalisation lists She continued to be known as Norah Aiton professionally, but also used the name Norah Tollenaar.  Career  Aiton told a newspaper interviewer of her enthusiasm for \\"ultra modern designs in steel and glass\\".‚ÄòDerby Girl Architect's Ambition‚Äô, Derby Daily Telegraph 15 July 1931, p11 and she admired the Dutch design school called De Stijl, partly inspired by the art of Piet Mondrian. After designing a house for Scott's parents at Stoke Poges, the partnership were given the chance to create offices for Aiton's father's manufacturing site in Derby. Unlike the more eclectic Scott, Aiton was a whole-hearted enthusiast for pioneering modernism. Aiton and Co is now closed but the building in Derby is Grade II listed Aiton's father gave the architects free rein'Sunlight Offices of Messrs J.A. Aiton', Derby Daily Telegraph, 16 July 1934 to come up with a cutting- edge innovative design which would reflect and promote the advanced technology behind the factory's products which included pipework for warships and power stations. This was especially apparent in the use of metal tubing echoing Aiton & Co.'s high spec pipes: used in the internal balustrades and elsewhere.British Listed Buildings:Former Aitons Works, Derby The dominant steel and glass were used with colour in a \\"De Stijl\\" scheme combining red floors and jade green interior walls with blue brick, grey window frames and stucco, and white cement.

Their work was featured in the press, books, trade journals, a RIBA exhibition and beyond, and yet they have not been included in mainstream histories of modernist design. Architectural historian Lynne Walker and others suggest this is because the history of modernist architecture in the UK has been written from a masculine perspective. In her twenties and thirties Aiton was called a \\"girl architect\\" in the press and was asked whether women were best suited to designing domestic buildings. She was said to be working \\"in a new sphere of women's activities\\".Derby Daily Telegraph, 15 July 1931, p2 In 1935, when the AA held an exhibition of women's architectural designs, there were said to be about 40 women architects in London.

Fiercely competitive, the Europeans soon sought to eliminate each other by forcibly taking control of the production centers, trade hubs and vital strategic locations, beginning with the Portuguese acquisition of Malacca in 1511. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries conquests focused on ports along the maritime routes, that provided a secure passage of maritime trade. It also allowed foreign rulers to levy taxes and control prices of the highly desired Southeast Asian commodities. By the 19th century, virtually all Southeast Asian lands had been forced into the various spheres of influence of European global players. Siam, which had served as a convenient buffer state, sandwiched between British Burma and French Indochina was the only country to avoid direct foreign rule. However, its kings had to contend with repeated humiliations, accept unequal treaties among massive British and French political interference and territorial losses after the Franco-Siamese War in 1893 and the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. The second phase of European colonization of Southeast Asia is related to the Industrial Revolution and the rise of powerful nation states in Europe. As the primary motivation for the first phase was the mere accumulation of wealth, the reasons for and degree of European interference during the second phase are dictated by geo-strategic rivalries, the need to defend and grow spheres of interest, competition for commercial outlets, long term control of resources and the Southeast Asian economies becoming more closely tied to European industrial and financial affairs by the late 19th century. Early phase Dutch and Portuguese ships battling over the control of Malacca during the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War, 1606 Afonso de Albuquerque, conqeror of Malacca in 1511 baptising a Moro convert in the Spanish East Indies, circa 1890. Advances in sciences, cartography, shipbuilding and navigation during the 15th to 17th centuries in Europe and tightening Turkish control and eventual shut down of the Eastern Mediterranean gateways into Asia first prompted Portuguese, and later Spanish and Dutch sea voyagers to ship around Africa in search of new trading routes and business opportunities. Niccol√≤ de' Conti arrived in Southeast Asia as the earliest documented European in the early 15th century. By 1498 Vasco da Gama, who had sailed round the Cape of Good Hope, established the first direct sea route from Europe to India. Discussed in Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, p. 452 Central among the various plannings was to establish direct and permanent trade of the highly priced spices, that were native to Southeast Asia, included pepper, cloves, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon. Competition among the various nations was fierce and violence commonplace in order to secure exclusive access to the centers of production. Eventually, the Dutch and the Spanish wrestled control of it from the Portuguese in the 17th century. In the 18th century, the British, who became increasingly engaged in Southeast Asia over their interests in India, gained control of it from the Dutch. Portugal was the first European power to establish a bridgehead in maritime Southeast Asia with the conquest of the Sultanate of Malacca in 1511. The Netherlands and Spain followed and soon superseded Portugal as the main European powers in the region. In 1599, Spain began to colonise the Philippines. In 1619, acting through the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch took the city of Sunda Kelapa, renamed it Batavia (now Jakarta) as a base for trading and expansion into the other parts of Java and the surrounding territory. In 1641, the Dutch took Malacca from the Portuguese.For fifty or sixty years, the Portuguese enjoyed the exclusive trade to China and Japan. In 1717, and again in 1732, the Chinese government offered to make Macao the emporium for all foreign trade, and to receive all duties on imports; but, by a strange infatuation, the Portuguese government refused, and its decline is dated from that period. (Roberts, 2007 PDF image 173 p. 166) Economic opportunities attracted Overseas Chinese to the region in great numbers. In 1775, the Lanfang Republic, possibly the first republic in the region, was established in West Kalimantan, present-day Indonesia, as a tributary state of the Qing Empire; the republic lasted until 1884, when it fell under Dutch occupation as Qing influence waned.Other experiments in republicanism in adjacent regions were the Japanese Republic of Ezo (1869) and the Republic of Taiwan (1895). Introduction of Christianity Portuguese catholic missionaries arrived in the 16th century under royal patronage and founded churches throughout the region. The Dutch first sent Protestant ministers during the 17th century. Their objective was more the spiritual service to the local Dutch people, rather than conversion of native people. The Spanish mission succeeded with the complete Christianisation of the Philippines. Industrialised phase The arrival of British in Mandalay in 1885 after the Third Anglo-Burmese War, marking the beginning of British rule in Burma. Singapore circa 1900. British logging in North Borneo, 1926 Global players During the early 17th century the rivalling Dutch traders joined the Dutch East India Company, as the British founded the British East India Company, followed by France, where in 1664 the French East India Company was authorised by royal funding. These conglomerates of capital, ships, freely transferable shares and state power were characterised by many institutional innovations, significantly decreasing the financial risk of the individual merchants and share holders. An early form of the modern giant global corporations and the introduction of the stock market had trade volumes reach unprecedented levels. Governmental support, military and administrative privileges, coining, legal and real estate rights enabled these enterprises to act as the official representatives of their country of origin in Southeast Asia. Initially, the British East India Company led by Josiah Child, had little interest in or impact on the region, and were effectively expelled following the Siam‚ÄìEngland war (1687). Britain, in the guise of the British East India Company, turned their attention to the Bay of Bengal following the Peace with France and Spain (1783). During the conflicts, Britain had struggled for naval superiority with the French, and the need of good harbours became evident. Penang Island had been brought to the attention of the Government of India by Francis Light. In 1786, the settlement of George Town was founded at the northeastern tip of Penang Island by Captain Francis Light, under the administration of Sir John Macpherson; this marked the beginning of British expansion into the Malay Peninsula.Company agent John Crawfurd used the census taken in 1824 for a statistical analysis of the relative economic prowess of the peoples there, giving special attention to the Chinese: The Chinese amount to 8595, and are landowners, field-labourers, mechanics of almost every description, shopkeepers, and general merchants. They are all from the two provinces of Canton and Fo-kien, and three-fourths of them from the latter. About five-sixths of the whole number are unmarried men, in the prime of life : so that, in fact, the Chinese population, in point of effective labour, may be estimated as equivalent to an ordinary population of above 37,000, and, as will afterwards be shown, to a numerical Malay population of more than 80,000! (Crawfurd image 48. p.30) Consolidation and centralisation of state authority By the latter half of the 18th century, Europe experienced the full effects of the Industrial Revolution, as rapid advancements in science, industry and technology, had created a tremendous gap in relative power between the Europeans and the rest of the world, including Southeast Asia. Extensive use of machines to manufacture goods would increase European demand for raw materials on the one hand and lead to the accumulation of surplus goods on the other. Mutual economic dependence had become real by the 19th century, as Southeast Asia was now an integral provider of material and resources for the European economies. To keep pace with surplus output, European manufacturers pushed the development of markets in new territories, such as Southeast Asia, which led to the next phase of establishing imperial rule. Transformation of political institutions in the colonies aimed at the full consolidation of the monopoly markets by their European planners. However, industrialisation took place against increasing competition among the European powers. This was encouraged by changes in the continental balance of power. The Napoleonic Wars unseated French power. The commercial and naval powers of Britain, which were unrivalled for a time, started to erode later on. Competition among European powers led to the practice of carving up the world into spheres of influence. There was also the need to fill ‚Äòvacuums‚Äô of territories that would otherwise fall under the influence of another competing European power. The British temporarily possessed Dutch territories during the Napoleonic Wars; and Spanish areas in the Seven Years' War. In 1819, Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an Anglo- Dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. British rule in Burma began with the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826). Early United States role Early American entry into what was then called the East Indies (usually in reference to the Malay Archipelago) was low key. In 1795, a secret voyage for pepper set sail from Salem, Massachusetts on an 18-month voyage that returned with a bulk cargo of pepper, the first to be so imported into the country, which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. In 1831, the merchantman Friendship of Salem returned to report the ship had been plundered, and the first officer and two crewmen murdered in Sumatra. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 obligated the Dutch to ensure the safety of shipping and overland trade in and around Aceh, who accordingly sent the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army on the punitive expedition of 1831. President Andrew Jackson also ordered America's first Sumatran punitive expedition of 1832, which was followed by a punitive expedition in 1838. The Friendship incident thus afforded the Dutch a reason to take over Ache; and Jackson, to dispatch diplomatist Edmund Roberts, who in 1833 secured the Roberts Treaty with Siam. In 1856 negotiations for amendment of this treaty, Townsend Harris stated the position of the United States: > The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it > desire any. The form of government forbids the holding of colonies. The > United States therefore cannot be an object of jealousy to any Eastern > Power. Peaceful commercial relations, which give as well as receive > benefits, is what the President wishes to establish with Siam, and such is > the object of my mission. New Imperialism Sabang off Sumatra, Dutch East Indies, image taken before 1927 Workshop in Hanoi, French Indochina circa 1935 Da Lat railway station, L√¢m ƒê·ªìng Province, French Indochina The phenomenon denoted New Imperialism, saw the conquest of nearly all Southeast Asian territories by the colonial powers. The Dutch East India Company and British East India Company were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over direct administration of the colonies. Only Siam managed to avoid direct foreign rule, although was compelled to political reforms and make generous concessions in order to appease the Western powers. The Monthon reforms of the late 19th century continuing up till around 1910, imposed a Westernised form of government on the country's partially independent cities called Mueang, such that the country could be said to have successfully colonised itself. Western powers did, however, continue to interfere in both internal and external affairs. By 1913, the British crown had occupied Burma, Malaya and the northern Borneo territories, the French controlled Indochina, the Dutch ruled the Netherlands East Indies while Portugal managed to hold on to Portuguese Timor. In the Philippines, the 1872 Cavite Mutiny was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution (1896‚Äì1898). When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began in Cuba in 1898, Filipino revolutionaries declared Philippine independence and established the First Philippine Republic the following year. In the Treaty of Paris of 1898 that ended the war with Spain, the United States gained the Philippines and other territories. No country recognized the self-proclaimed republic. Washington sent in the military to control the islands, in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, which ended when the rebel leadership was captured. Conflicts followed with the self-proclaimed Republic of Zamboanga, the Republic of Negros and the Republic of Katagalugan, all of which were also defeated. During the mid-19th century, the Europeans had certain goals which they regarded as important in the humanitarian sense. One of these goals was expressed in the slogan, ‚ÄòThe White Man's Burden‚Äô (taken from a line in a poem by Rudyard Kipling), which was the mission to ‚Äòcivilise‚Äô (uplift, advance) the ‚Äòless fortunate‚Äô and ‚Äòless gifted‚Äô people of Southeast Asia. Towards this end, they implemented policies providing educational and healthcare services.Kenton J. Clymer, \\"Humanitarian imperialism: David Prescott Barrows and the white man's burden in the Philippines.\\" Pacific Historical Review 45.4 (1976): 495-517.

Sometimes, the acquisition of colonies was an attempt to revive declining prestige rather than a show of power. France was preoccupied with expanding her colonial empire to recover from her humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. It expanded into Indochina in response to its need for international prestigeyo improve the government's image at home, and to keep abreast of other important European powers in terms of colonial acquisitions.

Role of the Europeans Dutch Batavia built in what is now Jakarta, by Andries Beeckman c. 1656 In the early phase, European control in Southeast Asia was largely confined to the establishment of trading posts. These trading posts were used to store the oriental products obtained from the local traders before they were exported to the European markets. Such trading posts had to be located along major shipping routes and their establishments had to be approved by the local ruler so that peace would prevail for trade to take place. Malacca, Penang, Batavia and Singapore were all early trading posts. The role of the Europeans changed, however, in the industrialised phase as their control expanded beyond their trading posts. As the trading posts grew due to an increase in the volume of trade, demand for food supplies and timber (to build and repair ships) also increased. To ensure a reliable supply of food and timber, the Europeans were forced to deal with the local communities nearby. These marked the beginnings of territorial control. A good example is the case of Batavia. There, the Dutch extended control over parts of western Java and later to central Java and the east where rice was grown and timber found. To ensure that trade flourish, the Europeans had to maintain political stability. Sometimes, they interfered with the internal affairs of the natives to maintain peace. The Europeans also tried to impose their culture on their colonies. Impact European interference has effected Southeast Asians on all major existential issues. Exploited by the colonial economic system, robbed of the vast regional resources and subjected to racial and ethnic discrimination on the one hand, yet witnessing the rapid transformation towards modernity, scientific and technical progress, the import of secular political and education systems and humane ideas, that contradicted the current colonial reality on the other. Perception of the political reality differed widely among the Southeast Asian regions and the early 20th century popular, communist movement leaders of Vietnam were notably optimistic and ‚Äúpredicted a blessed future in which automobiles and trains would no longer be uniquely Western‚Äù, while Dutch author J.H. Boeke observed, that ‚Äúsocieties like Indonesia were incurably dual‚Äù. Increased labour demand resulted in mass immigration, especially from British India and China, which brought about massive demographic change. The study of institutions for a modern democratic nation state with a state bureaucracy, courts of law, print media and modern education, sowed the seeds of the fledgling nationalist and independence movements among the colonial subjects. During the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded self- determination. The expansion of European dominance through colonialism was considered extraordinary as it affected the entirety of Southeast Asia significantly. Later on, more common features would emerge, such as the rise of nationalist movements, the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia, and later the Cold War that engulfed many parts of the region. Taken altogether, it can be said that a common core of historical experiences existed, and that this core defined the region, thus justifying the use of the term ‚ÄòSoutheast Asia‚Äô to describe the region as a single entity.

In April 2016, Welteroth was named editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, making her the second person of African- American heritage in Cond√© Nast's 107-year history to hold such a title. Her promotion to editor at age 29 makes her the second youngest editor in Cond√© Nast history, behind current Teen Vogue EIC Lindsay Peoples Wagner who was 28 when she started in the role in Cond√© Nast. When she became beauty director of Teen Vogue in 2012, Welteroth was the first person of African-American heritage to serve in the role. She is credited for the notable increase of Teen Vogue coverage of politics and social justice, encouraging readers to become civically engaged, specifically during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Under Welteroth's leadership of Teen Vogue's shifting format, the magazine developed its first YouTube channel, featuring content on diverse subjects from campus style to cultural appropriation. The final print edition of Teen Vogue was December 2017. On January 11, 2018, Welteroth resigned from Teen Vogue and moved to California and signed with CAA. In June 2019 her memoir, More Than Enough: Claiming Space for Who You Are (No Matter What They Say), was published by Viking. Early life  Welteroth was born in Newark, California to a white father and African American mother. She grew up in Fremont, California and in 2004, she graduated from Newark Memorial High School in Newark, California, where she competed in track and field. In 2007, Welteroth graduated from California State University-Sacramento, majoring in mass communication/media studies with a minor in journalism.  Career  Welteroth's first job in her hometown was being a mascot for her local Hometown Buffet, wearing a bird suit. She has described the best career advice she's ever received as: \\"Bite off more than you can chew. And then chew as fast as you can\\". As a Multicultural Advertising Intern Program (MAIP) Fellow, Welteroth secured an internship at the advertising, marketing, and public relations firm, Ogilvy & Mather, upon graduation from California State University-Sacramento. She then became a content producer for SomaGirls.TV, a digital media company. Welteroth broke into the magazine industry via an unpaid internship at Ebony magazine. In pursuit of the internship, Welteroth wrote Harriette Cole, then editor in chief, a letter asking for an informational interview, sent her an email, and called her assistant numerous times. Cole gave Welteroth the chance to assist with a cover shoot for Serena Williams in Los Angeles. Impressed with Welteroth's professionalism on set, Cole decided to fly her out for an internship with Cole at Ebony; Welteroth then later became Cole's assistant. This next became a permanent position as the magazine's Beauty & Style Editor from 2008 to 2011. Welteroth joined Cond√© Nast in September 2011 by becoming the Beauty & Style editor for Glamour magazine in 2011, and then Senior Beauty Editor. She became the Beauty & Health Director at Teen Vogue in October 2012, making her the first African- American to hold this position. In the February 2013 copy of Teen Vogue, her debut issue as Beauty & Health Director, she penned the article \\"Natural Wonder\\", where Welteroth encouraged readers to embrace their natural hair texture while also sharing her favorite natural hair products. Welteroth was named editor of Teen Vogue in May 2016, replacing the founding editor-in-chief Amy Astley when Astley left to become editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest. On September 8, 2016, Welteroth was honored at the 2016 Fashion Show & Style Awards through Harlem's Fashion Row, a platform for multicultural fashion designers, as Editor of the Year. In 2016, Welteroth was named number 47 on The Root's list of 100 influential African-Americans. Cond√© Naste officially named Welteroth editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue on April 29, 2017. In 2017, Girls Write Now, a non-profit mentorship program based in New York City which encourages at-risk girls to find their voices through writing, named her an honoree for their May 23 annual awards ceremony. Social media influence Via Instagram, Welteroth quickly developed her brand and Teen Vogue's brand by posting behind the scenes photos and videos of photoshoots, her personal photos, and selfies with celebrities. In 2014, as Teen Vogue's beauty and health director, she was invited by Target to update a Fashion Week Instagram Diary of her experience being backstage at the New York and London Fashion Weeks. Her social media also broadcasts her own accomplishments and Teen Vogue's accomplishments, by sharing personal footage from her personal and professional life at least once or twice a day. Influence on Teen Vogue Welteroth expanded the magazine's focus and received recognition for the noticeable increase of content in Teen Vogue on politics and social justice, including critical coverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Welteroth's first issue to print as editor of Teen Vogue had Willow Smith as the cover model and featured headlines like \\"Cultural Appreciation: Real Girls, Real Beauty, Real Talk\\". The December 2016 cover featured actresses and feminists, Rowan Blanchard and Yara Shahidi on the \\"Smart Girls\\" issue. Welteroth also invited Blanchard and Shahidi to serve as guest editors, the first ever in the history of the publication. She also kicked off the \\"Teen Vogue Book Club\\" with Blanchard and Shahidi selecting their favorite book, Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston. Blanchard, Shahidi, and Welteroth used Teen Vogue's Facebook account to live stream a discussion about the book in November 2016, allowing the magazine's target audience to engage with political texts by black women that have shaped the continued work of scholar-activists. The December 2016 issue also featured a conversation between American actress Zendaya Coleman and former First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama on the worldwide education of girls. This new direction for the magazine emphasizes digital publication, and the print magazine publication schedule was changed from 10 issues per year, in a small format, to becoming a quarterly publication, in a larger, thicker format. Teen Vogue developed a YouTube channel which, as of March 2017, has over 500,00 subscribers and over 800 pieces of original content, for instance \\"A Fact Check on Trump's First Speech to Congress\\", uploaded March 1, 2017. The video allows viewers to recap current President Donald Trump's speech to Congress. On December 7, 2016, Teen Vogue made an appearance on the award-winning ABC sitcom Black-ish. In the episode \\"Nothing, but Nepotism\\", Welteroth plays herself as editor of Teen Vogue while Black-ish character Zoe gets the opportunity to intern at Teen Vogue to boost her high school resume by using her advertising executive father's professional connections. The episode resulted in discussions on nepotism in the black community, such as the article, \\"On black nepotism and this week's epic 'black-ish' & 'Teen Vogue' crossover\\" by Blavity writer Trey Mangum. During the advance screening of the episode and discussion, Welteroth raised the question, \\"Is black nepotism just leveling the playing field?\\" At Slate, Mark Joseph Stern credited Welteroth for developing Teen Vogue into a publication that \\"treats teenagers like rounded human beings with agency and intellect\\". Stern continues with, \\"The result is a teen glossy with seriously good political coverage and legal analysis, an outlet for teenagers who‚Äîshockingly!‚Äîare able to think about fashion and current events simultaneously.\\" Feminist writer Lara Witt praised Teen Vogue in the article, \\"Vogue Magazine Has A Race Problem, And It's Getting Tired\\", featured on Wear Your Voice. Witt stated, \\"Rather than participating in the blatant erasure of people of color and our cultures, Vogue‚Äôs younger sibling has included features celebrating indigenous, South Asian, East Asian, black and Muslim teens. Thanks to their radical push to be unafraid to represent more than just white, heterosexual, cisgender women, Teen Vogue is providing more readers with representation.\\"  Public speaking  During the 2015 New York Fashion Week, Welteroth facilitated a discussion about diversity in fashion, beauty standards, and cultural appropriation with former model turned fashion activist, Bethann Hardison, at \\"The Future of Fashion Talk Series,\\" sponsored by HQ Events. Welteroth speaks at varying conferences like the 2017 PATH 40-year celebration and the 2017 Women of Power Summit through Black Enterprise magazine. During these conferences, she has spoken on topics ranging from integrative technology and global health to activism and culture.  Personal life  In December 2016, Welteroth became engaged to musician Jonathan Singletary and was married in May, 2020. The wedding took place in their street and followed strict social distancing laws set out as a result of the Coronavirus. The two originally met as children while they attended the same church. She also provided background vocals for Singletary's song, \\"Don't Fight Alone\\".

She served in the office of Depositario of the Inquisition in Malta in 1760-1778. Life In 1752 she married to cousin, Baron Paolo Testaferrata Abela, Patrizio Messina e Roma, (1736-1760), 3rd Barone di Gomerino, with whom she had several children. Her spouse held the office of 'Depositario' within the Inquisition. The Depositario headed the administrative staff of the Inquisitor‚Äôs Tribunal as well as being the accountant of the court, thereby in charge of all payments, including the Inquisitor‚Äôs salary. When she became a widow in 1760, she succeeded her spouse in his office. She did this because the office was inherited from father to son in the family of her spouse, and by the time of her husband's death, she was pregnant, and gave birth to their first son, Pietro Paolo Testaferrata, only after her spouse's death. With the exception of a short period, she remained in office until 1778. This was an unprecedented achievement, as women normally did not hold any of the offices of the Inquisition. She temporarily gave up the office in 1762 of her own inclination to her late spouse's uncle Canon Testaferrata, who was the preferred choice of Inquisitor Durinito. However, Canon Testaferrata accepted the office unwillingly; he pointed out that he was old and that the inheritance right to the office must be protected for her son, and after his death in 1763, she accepted to resume the office until her son became of legal majority. The Inquisitor Guilio Carpegna, praised her for her service in the office and referred to her as 'the prototype of a titled Maltese Lady'.

It was released as both a DVD and two-disc CD by Image Entertainment in 2002. The concert consists of Newton and her band performing many of her hits along with new songs. As a bonus four new studio recordings are included on the second disc of the CD release. The DVD contains these songs as audio-only tracks and also includes some interviews with Newton and her band members. Overview=Background Juice Newton began her recording career in 1975 but did not achieve major stardom until the release of her 1981 album Juice. The album was a crossover success and yielded three hit singles, \\"Angel of the Morning\\", \\"Queen of Hearts\\", and \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\". The last of these peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Chart. She followed Juice with Quiet Lies (1982), an album that brought her two more hits, \\"Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me\\" and \\"Break It to Me Gently\\", of which the latter earned her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Newton's 1985 album Old Flame was her country breakthrough, spawning three number one hits \\"You Make Me Want to Make You Mine\\", \\"Hurt\\", and the duet with Eddie Rabbitt \\"Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)\\" and also three additional Top Ten hits: \\"Old Flame\\", \\"Cheap Love\\", and \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\". After two more albums (Emotion and Ain't Gonna Cry) Newton concentrated more on concert performing. Newton returned to recording in 1997 with The Trouble With Angels, an album made up largely of re-recordings of her earlier hits. She followed two years later with American Girl, which consisted of new material. Of the latter music critic Charlotte Dillon stated \\"Newton's husky voice puts an original touch to each tune, sure to please both new and old fans. An album worth having.\\" The concert The concert that appears in Every Road Leads Back to You was performed at the Key Club on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, California, on September 10, 2001 (one day before terrorist attacks in New York City). During the concert Newton and her band performed 21 song with five included in two medleys. Five songs originated from her Juice album (\\"Shot Full of Love\\", \\"Ride 'em Cowboy\\", \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\", \\"Angel of the Morning\\", and \\"Queen of Hearts\\") while three were taken from Quiet Lies (\\"Love's Been a Little Hard On Me\\", \\"Break It To Me Gently\\" and \\"Love Sail Away\\"). From the Old Flame album came four songs (\\"This Old Flame\\", \\"You Make Me Want To Make You Mine\\", \\"Cheap Love\\", and \\"Hurt\\"). Two songs were taken from The Trouble With Angels (the title track and \\"Red Blooded American Girl\\") while another two derived from American Girl (\\"Night Time Without You\\" and \\"They Never Made It To Memphis\\"). The concert also presented four new songs previously unrecorded by Newton. \\"Your Heart Is Showing\\" was presented as the opening number while the title track, \\"Every Road Leads Back to You\\", and \\"Love Is Still Alive and Well\\" were presented in the concert and also as a bonus studio tracks. The concert's closing track \\"It's Late\\" was performed as an a cappella encore. The DVD The DVD of Every Road Leads Back to You was released by Image Entertainment in 2002. The concert is presented in 18 tracks with the first listed as \\"Opening\\" and the last as \\"End Credits\\". The 16 tracks in between form the body of the concert. The bonus material included in the DVD consists of four interview segments (\\"Growing Up\\", \\"On the Road\\", \\"Song Writing\\", and \\"Influences and Excitement\\") and four audio only studio tracks (\\"Love Is Still Alive and Well\\", \\"If I Could I Would\\", \\"Every Road Leads Back To You\\", and \\"Your Heart Is Showing\\"). \\"Love Is Still Alive and Well\\" is also presented in video form as a concert outtake. Critical reception In his review of the CD release of the album music critic Gregory McIntosh stated: :Every Road Leads Back to You marks another yet another collection wrapped around the '80s hits of Juice Newton, but these versions are re-recorded and a few of her biggest hits are presented here as sections of a pair of medleys instead of being self-contained. This makes Every Road Leads Back to You an interesting study for those who already have the original hit recordings, but not a necessity since the performances lack any sort of convincing deviation from the originals nor are they quite as spirited. Many other collections have been offered up of higher quality, most notably Juice Newton's Greatest Hits (And More) issued by Capitol, which has been the benchmark of Newton anthologies for several years running. However the reviewer for DVDnet was more positive about the album and DVD by stating: :Juice Newton ‚Äì Every Road Leads Back To You is a concert performance by a very talented artist in her prime. Covering an array of songs from her many albums and featuring a selection from her new release of the same name as this disc, she ably demonstrates her obvious talent as a singer. Like most people unfamiliar with the music of Juice Newton, I was fully expecting a non-stop show of country and western tracks. Yes, there are a number of country tunes, but there are also songs that show her obvious influences from folk and rhythm and blues music.

Education and career  From July 1991 onward, Block worked at the University of California, Berkeley as a professor (and subsequently professor emerita) of Community Health and Human Development in the School of Public Health. In 1993 she founded NutritionQuest which produces assessments of diet and physical activity for researchers.  Block FFQ  During her time at the National Cancer Institute (1982 to 1991), Block developed a semi- quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that would later come to be known as the Block FFQ. The approach to questionnaire design was first described in a paper co-authored with Hartman, Dresser, Carroll, Gannon, and Gardner in 1986. Research by Block, Potosky, and Clifford on validation of the questionnaire was published in 1990. After leaving the National Cancer Institute in 1991, Block continued to work on the FFQ, offering it through the company, NutritionQuest, that she founded in 1993. Subsequent released versions include the Block 95 and Block 98 FFQs. A web version was also released and validated. The Block FFQ has been used in third-party research and has also been the subject of validation and comparison studies. The Block FFQ is the earliest of the currently widely used FFQs in the United States. Other semi-quantitative FFQs include the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) and NHANES (also developed at the National Cancer Institute) and the Harvard FFQ, developed by a team at Harvard University led by Walter Willett.  Work = Vitamins  In 1992, Block's review of 15 epidemiological studies on cancer rates and intake of Vitamin C was mentioned in the New York Times. Block has been cited in media coverage of the debate around the efficacy of dietary multivitamin supplements in combating health risks including the risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Others taking a similar position as Block (in favor of dietary supplements) include Harvard professor Walter Willett (designer of the Harvard FFQ), researcher Bruce N. Ames, and Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Those on the other side include Marion Nestle, Joan Gussow, Catherine Wotecki, Walter Mertz, and Edgar Miller.  Variety in diet  Block has led research on the variety in people's diet and its effects on people's nutrient consumption and health status. She has been cited on the subject in the New York Times.  Alive!  Block has developed a program called ALIVE that people can use to improve their diet and physical activity. The program and its spinoff, ALIVE-PD (to help prediabetics prevent diabetes) are currently offered through Turnaround Health, a division of NutritionQuest.

It protects an area of Atlantic Forest that is regenerating after damage from human intervention. Location The Serra do Conduru State Park is divided between the municipalities of Uru√ßuca (44%), Itacar√© (41%) and Ilh√©us (15%) in Bahia. It has an area of . The buffer zone covers . The park is in the eastern hydrographic basin of Bahia. It includes the Lagoa Encantada, the village of Serra Grande, the Itacar√© Forest and the mountainous coastline. Human activities include extreme sports, adventure tourism, mountaineering, trekking, mountain biking and ecotourism. Threats include illegal logging and poaching, and delays in regularization of land ownership. Environment The average annual temperature is , with a super-humid tropical climate. The park contains the headwaters of 30 rivers and streams. The park is in the Atlantic Forest biome and consists of dense submontane rainforest in various stages of succession. Vegetation includes many clearings for agriculture or pasture and fragments of forest in different stages of regeneration. The vegetation is always green, and includes trees up to in height as well as dense shrub growth of ferns, arborescents, bromeliads, palms, vines, orchids and cactuses. The wetlands that have not been disturbed by people hold fig trees, palm trees and palmettos. There are as many as 458 tree species per hectare, a very high rate of biodiversity. About 72% of species are typical of the Amazon Forest. 175 bird species have been identified, including 27 that are endemic and six that are threatened. They include red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii), red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha) and ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata). 9 species of small mammals have been recorded and 30 species of medium or large mammals. These include golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), golden- bellied capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and coastal black-handed titi (Callicebus melanochir). At least 45 species of endemic amphibians with limited distribution have been identified, including Hylomantis √°spera, Eleutherodactylus bilineatus, Cycloramphus migueli and Hyla sibilata. History The campaign to create the Serra do Conduru State Park began in 1993, and was promoted in 1996 by Conservation International Brazil, the SOS Atlantic Forest Foundation and the Institute of Social and Environmental Studies of Southern Bahia (IESB). The park was formally created by 6.227 of 21 February 1997. In 1998 highway BA-001 from Ilh√©us to Itacar√© was inaugurated, prompting studies on land regularization and closing the sawmills in southern Bahia that threatened the ancient trees of the region. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. Decree 8.702 of 4 November 2003 expanded the size of the park. The composition of the park's management board was agreed in November 2010. By 2011 the park had formal tenure over 51% of the land, but was still vulnerable due to lack of infrastructure for protecting the land and allowing public use.

As of September 2015, the firm had 160 lawyers. History Seward & Kissel began as Smith & Martin and has been headquartered in downtown New York City since its founding. In 1949, the firm advised in the formation of the first hedge fund. It opened its Washington office in 1977 and its transportation and shipping practice in 1992. The firm ‚Äúhas remained independent since its founding in 1890, a rarity for a midsize law firm these days,‚Äù noted one financial website in 2015. Seward & Kissel takes the first half of its name from George Seward, who became a partner at Meyer, Kidder, Matz & Kissel, one the previous iterations of the firm, in 1953. He remained an active partner until 1983 and continued working at the firm until 2011. He held many leadership positions at the American Bar Association, founded the business law section of the International Bar Association, and was the honorary life president of the International Bar Association. He died in 2012 at the age of 101. In September 2015, the firm celebrated its 125th anniversary by burying a time capsule outside its Battery Park offices. The plan is for the capsule to be recovered 125 years later.

He was instrumental in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests and continues to work to promote an understanding of the historical treaty rights and indigenous rights of Native American people. Archambault holds degrees in Business Administration and Management. In 2017 he joined FirstNation HealthCare as its chief consulting officer.  Early life and education  David Archambault II was born in Denver, Colorado, to parents, Betty Archambault (maternal grandparents: Francine Brewer and Willard Yellow Wood Nelson) and David Archambault Sr. (paternal grandparents: Lillian Halsey and Leo Archambault). His mother is a teacher at the Standing Rock Community School and his father was an educator and one of the early leaders in the tribal colleges and universities movement. Archambault grew up with his family on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and attended the Little Wound School in Kyle, South Dakota. Archambault says he spent a lot of time with his grandfather while growing up and learned to hunt, fish, cut wood, work in the garden, and ride horses. Recalling his youth, he relates that his grandmother told him that she was forcibly taken from her parents to attend a boarding school and beaten for speaking her native language. Youths were threatened with jail if they were caught practicing their religion. His uncles were involved in the grassroots American Indian Movement and were attacked by the FBI. Archambault remembers his grandfather and his wife's father for their abilities to \\"tell stories\\". He says, \\"A lot of the things I do today are things that I learned from my grandpa Willard and my father-in-law John Thunder Hawk.\\" Archambault attended Standing Rock Community College (now Sitting Bull College), Bismarck State College, and earned a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from North Dakota State University. He earned a master's degree in Management from the University of Mary. Standing Rock Tribal Council Archambault was elected as Chairman of the Standing Rock Tribal Council in September 2013, defeating Mike Faith and replacing Charles Murphy, who had been chair for many of the previous thirty years .Bismarck Tribune Staff, \\"Dave Archambault Officially in as Standing Rock Chairman\\", Bismarck Tribune, 30 September 2013. In 2017, he was defeated by Mike Faith. Archambault has frequently spoken on behalf of the Standing Rock Tribe and allied people's protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline and other Indian rights issues. He has spoken about indigenous rights before Congress and the United Nations Human Rights Council. In 2014 Archambault and his wife Nicole met President Barack Obama when he attended a Flag Day at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Archambault praised Obama for helping to correct \\"historic wrongs\\" involving tribal land disputes saying, \\"Sitting Bull once asked the government in Washington to send him an honest man. If Sitting Bull were sitting here today, he'd be honored.\\" Pipeline resistance movement Archambault was instrumental in protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline and setting up resistance camps on land adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation. In August 2016, he was arrested, charged with disorderly conduct and strip searched when he crossed a \\"no trespassing\\" sign while protesting. In defense of tribal sovereignty, Archambault spoke with numerous journalists, providing information about the history of the movement and the history of treaty and indigenous rights. He criticized the militaristic-style police response to the protesters at Standing Rock. Writing in an editorial in The New York Times he said: :\\"Perhaps only in North Dakota, where oil tycoons wine and dine elected officials, and where the governor, Jack Dalrymple, serves as an adviser to the Trump campaign, would state and county governments act as the armed enforcement for corporate interests. In recent weeks, the state has militarized my reservation, with road blocks and license-plate checks, low-flying aircraft and racial profiling of Indians. The local sheriff and the pipeline company have both called our protest \\"unlawful,\\" and Gov. Dalrymple has declared a state of emergency.\\" The protesters achieved their goal of blocking the pipeline. After months of protest, in December 2016 the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the Obama administration announced that it would not grant an easement for the pipeline and was undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. In February 2017, newly-elected President Donald Trump ended the environmental impact assessment and ordered construction to continue. The pipeline was completed in April. Saying, \\"Our fight isn‚Äôt over until there is permanent protection of our people and resources from the pipeline,\\" Archambault said that he and the tribe will continue to protest and work for Native American rights issues. Lauren Donovan, \\"Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault arrested at Dakota Access Pipeline protest\\", Bismarck Tribune, Aug. 12, 2016. He disputes the claim that they are promoting \\"energy independence\\" and argues that true energy independence can only come through non-fossil fuel energy sources. Archambault believes that the pipeline protests have helped to awaken and empower young people, both locally and internationally.  Native American Rights and Economic Development  Archambault testified before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, led the Washington, D.C., ‚ÄúNative Nations Rise‚Äù march and published editorials in The New York Times. Among many awards and honors Chairman Archambault was named a ‚ÄúLeading Global Thinker of 2016‚Äù by Foreign Policy Magazine, was given the \\"Native American Leadership Award\\" by the National Congress of American Indians, was honored as the \\"Global Green Champion\\" at the 14th Annual Global Green Pre- Oscar Party and received a \\"Doctorate of Law Honoris Causa\\" from the Vermont Law School. In 2017, Archambault joined the Native American Venture Fund to promote the expansion of Native American Economic development, while maintaining the tribes culture, sovereignty and values. Family Archambault has seven siblings: Billi Hornbeck, Jodi Gillette, Sunshine Carlow, Amber Powless, Rick Red Blanket, Charles Archambault, and Jim Archambault. He is married to Nicole Thunder Hawk and they have two children, Jaimie and Jayce. He writes that family is very important to him: :\\"Along with my in-laws we still grow fresh vegetables, hunt, fish, and raise horses. As a young father, I want my children to experience reservation life. It‚Äôs hard because more and more we are losing our identity. If we don‚Äôt pass on some of the good ways that were shared with us, our children‚Äôs children will not know who or what they are. Through my eyes ‚Äì I see the youth as the most important. I want to create an environment for them so they can experience the most meaningful life lessons. Or at least try! Many members of Archambault's family have worked to support Native American causes. In 2009, President Obama appointed his sister Jodi Gillette to be Deputy Associate Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. She was the first Native American to hold that position, which acts as the \\"front door\\" to the White House for tribal nations. During her time in office she worked on the 2013 Violence Against Women Act, which recognized the inherent right of tribal nations to prosecute non-Indians who commit violence against women. His sister Sunshine Carlow is active in promoting Native American culture. She facilitates the Standing Rock Education Consortium and the Lakota/Dakota Language Revitalization Program in Fort Yates, North Dakota. Sister Billie Hornbeck works as financial aid director at Oglala Lakota College.

However, some sources claim this was at the nearby Hippodrome Theatre.James Mason Obituary The Glasgow Herald 28 July 1984 pg 8 ‚Äì Google News The Theatre Royal went bankrupt in the 1930s and was reopened as a Variety Theatre by Ben Garcia in 1940 who managed it during World War II. Aldershot being a Garrison Town, much of the audience at this time was male leading to a number of nude revues being held at the theatre. Other acts at this time included Tod Slaughter in the melodrama Jack the Ripper, Billy Reid and his accordion band with Dorothy Squires as his vocalist, and Phyllis Dixey in her revue Peek A Boo. Decline From 1946 to 1948 the Theatre Royal was home to Harry Hanson's Court Players. In the late 1940s, as her film career floundered, Jessie Matthews ran an amateur theatre group at the theatre. In 1948 Garcia leased the theatre to another management who formed the Aldershot Repertory Company who put on plays there including Pygmalion in 1950 starring Jessie Matthews until their final production, the pantomime Aladdin in December 1952. Following this there was a short season of repertory theatre by the Arthur Brough Players but the theatre again went bankrupt and finally closed. A backstage fire in 1957 lead to great damage and the Theatre Royal was demolished in 1959. A block of flats, Matin√©e House, occupies the site today.

The film features are Mark Anthony Stroman, Rais Bhuiyan and Ilan Ziv. The film is a chronicle of Stroman's path from revenge killer to being forgiven by a victim as he waits on Texas's Death Row. The film opened on October 28, 2016 in the United States and Canada.  Plot  In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, dozens of attacks against Muslims, Sikhs and other minorities were reported across America. Among the perpetrators was Mark Anthony Stroman, who began \\"hunting Arabs,\\" as he described his nightly prowling. His target was on people whom he believed were Muslim who came from the Middle East. He killed two and partially blinded a young man‚Äîall immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Luckily, he was arrested before he fell through with his plan to massacre dozens of Muslim worshipers at a local Dallas Mosque. On April 5, 2002, Stroman was convicted and sentenced to Death. In the weeks before in impending execution, his only surviving victim became his biggest advocate ‚Äì Rais Bhuiyan, a devout and recently half-blind Muslim. He began a campaign to spare Mark's life in the name of Islam and its notion of mercy, becoming one of the most vocal campaigners against Stroman's execution. The Press at the time labeled this as the first post 9/11 hate crimes and even Stroman himself stated that \\"blinded by rage\\", he killed to avenge the United States of America. With in-depth interviews, the film follows Stroman's story through to his execution. Central to the film is the bond that developed between Stroman and the Israeli-born filmmaker Ilan Ziv.  Reviews  , the film has a 71% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on seven reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10. Film Journal International states, \\"An Eye for an Eye, tough to take as it is -- with nigh unbearable-to-listen-to audiotapes of the murder being committed -- turns out to be one of the most searinlgy honest and moving depictions of redemption and the power of forgiveness ever made. The Hollywood Reporter says, \\"as our encounters with him continue, it becomes clearer that Stroman -- whose early life is nearly guaranteed problems ahead -- evolved dramatically behind bars, and that his remorse for his crimes is sincere\\". The Los Angeles Times says, \\"the rehabilitative power of forgiveness [throughout the film] is thought-provokingly explored\\". The Globe and Mail from Toronto says it was \\"a well-layered film\\" that makes \\"a fascinating case for forgiveness and a sharp rebuke of Bible-taught eye-for-an-eye revenge\\".

Background Lefko first approached Hart's management about the book in 1998, and it went through numerous different phases until the incarnation which was eventually published. Hart has expressed that he wrote the book to remind people of many of his matches which were unavailable due to them being under the ownership of WWF whom Hart was on bad terms with at the time of the book's production and release. Content The books narrative is told majorly through images from Hart's career with text captions containing wrestling related anecdotes. Due to Hart's strained relationship with WWF at the time of the book's release no pictures from his time working there are included. There are also several family photos and features never-before-seen photos from a private collection. The book also includes Hart's written tribute to his brother Owen who died in a wrestling related accident in 1999. https://www.nzpwi.co.nz/2003/05/bret- hart-interview/ The book features quotes and comments from Ric Flair, Curt Hennig, Sting, Hulk Hogan and Bill Goldberg.

The president of Stoddart; Nelson Doucet said: \\"At the sales conference, the salespeople recognized that we had a winner, and we were too conservative with our 35,000 initial printing, It became very obvious, very quickly, that we had a very successful title on our hands. The initial reaction from the market has confirmed that. The initial 150,000 print run is just the beginning. The book appeals not only to traditional market but also to specialty markets.\\" He added that Hart is a very popular figure and that his career was filled with a lot of controversy.

Premise Pol√©mica en el bar features a number of comedians gathered in a bar, sitting in a round table. They discuss topics such as football, politics and show business, and start controversies around them. Production Pol√©mica en el bar was first introduced in 1962, as a sketch of the comedy program Operaci√≥n Ja-Ja. It starred Gerardo Sofovich, Juan Carlos Altavista, Jorge Porcel, Carlos Carella and Rodolfo Crespi, as people discussing modern issues at the table of a bar. Alberto Ir√≠zar played the owner of the bar, and Vicente La Russa the waiter. The program had a positive reception, and was a steady sketch of the program for several years. The sketch was promoted to a standalone program in 1972, starred by Sofovich, Altavista, Porcel, Javier Portales, Adolfo Garc√≠a Grau and Fidel Pintos. Most episodes got nearly 60 rating points. The cast changed as years passed, and most of the new comedians were not as capable as the former ones, which led to a decline in rating and popular reception. The program aired until 2010, with the final line-up being Sofovich, Guillermo Marconi, Ren√© Bertrand, Sergio Gonal, Horacio Pagani and Guillermo Miguel. Gerardo Sofovich died in 2015. His son, Gustavo Sofovich, made a reboot of the program the following year, also titled Pol√©mica en el bar.

Its architect was Manuel Mar√≠a Am√°bilis Dom√≠nguez, from M√©rida, Yucat√°n, who proposed the project named \\"ITZA\\" in collaboration with two Yucatecan artists that he had met in Paris, Leopoldo Tommasi L√≥pez (in charge of the sculptures) and V√≠ctor Manuel Reyes (in charge of the drawings). The building is inspired on Mesoamerican architecture; specifically the Maya architectural style known as Puuc and the Toltec-influenced style of Chichen Itza, both found in Yucat√°n. The construction began at the beginning of 1927 and ended on August 1928, despite having undergone some renovations in its interior. On its facade appear some reliefs with allegories and sculptures, and by the time of the exposition the interior was very profusely decorated and packed with craft objects. The building also has a backyard with a fountain decorated with Maya and Toltec motives.

He also served as a physician with the 365th Infantry Regiment of the 92nd Division during World War I, where many of the African American soldiers served. Early life Arthur Booker was born on October 31, 1881 to Anderson and Carrie Booker in San Antonio, Texas. His father had been a farmer who worked in South Carolina before the break of the American Civil War. According to records, his father served in the U.S. Colored Infantries in the Union Army and listed that he was from Texas. The couple had had seven children together‚ÄîArthur, Ola, Ulissia, Allen, Cameron, Leaman, and Melvin. Booker attended public school in San Antonio, and then proceeded to continue is education in Prairie View College in Texas. Booker held no real attachment to Texas as he headed all the way to Chicago, Illinois, to attend Northwestern University's medical school (now called Feinberg School of Medicine), with a large population of white students. He graduated from Northwestern on June 28, 1906. He left the school with both bachelor of science and medical doctor degrees, which was part of the medical school's curriculum before the 1930s. After graduating, Dr. Booker interned at Provident Hospital in Cook County. He did not remain there for long, as he decided to try his skills in Europe for several years, before becoming moving to Iowa in 1919. Dr. Booker became an instructor at Drake University‚Äôs medical school, teaching courses on human anatomy. After two years, he left the academic sphere and opened a private practice, specializing as a diagnostician. Booker was well known in Des Moines, where he eventually settled, as he published many health articles in the Journal of Iowa State Medical Society and wrote a health column in the local African American publication, Iowa Bystander. One of the articles he wrote was one published in 1915, regarding bronchopneumonia in children, which he saw was a growing concern. Booker also made occasional speeches at the African Methodist Episcopal Church on disease prevention, particularly on tuberculosis. Many physicians in Iowa, including Dr. Booker, believed that tuberculosis had a large chance of making a comeback, as the Iowa State Medical Society in 1915 calculated 145 cases appeared per 100,000 persons. Military service Eager to take part in the new war in Europe, Booker volunteered for the Iowa National Guard, which was one of the first dispatches to be sent to France in World War I. However, much to his disappointment, he was rejected because of his race. However this did not deter him, as through the next year he sought to recruit African-American men for the war and became well known for how articulately he could speak to a crowd. Near his home, a new camp was erected for World War I volunteers called Fort Des Moines. It had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that they had been unfairly assessed for merely being black. At the age of 36, Booker volunteered for the Army Medical Corps and once accepted was made a first lieutenant. Like the majority of the African- American recruits, Booker was sent for basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School. After about two months of training, Booker was assigned to the 365th Infantry Regiment which was part of the 92nd Division's 183rd infantry Brigade, which was under the command of Brigadier General Malvern Hill Barnum. Before arriving in Europe, Booker spent additional training with his unit at Camp Grant in Illinois. In 1917, Booker and many African-American men were sent to France. Exhausted from facing aggressive German assaults, the French leadership had requested American reinforcements for months. Not wanting to deal with the African-American soldiers, General Pershing sent the 92nd Division to assist. At the arrival of Booker, the Spanish influenza had already taken the lives of many soldiers and an epidemic was spreading. The majority of Lieutenant Booker's service was spent aiding the ailing men who were suffering from influenza or other illnesses associated with months of living and fighting in the trenches, and the harsh winter that followed. Career After the war, Booker returned to his wife in Des Moines and continued his practice. He later chaired the Health Bureau of Negro Business Men's League and lectured on healthy living. In the 1920s, there was a large influx of African Americans moving to California for better job opportunities, and the Bookers were amongst them. Dr. Booker took a position as a surgeon in Los Angeles, California. Along with his job, he also a member of the Howard Drew Medical Association. Booker was a community organizer, participating and leading many events for African Americans. When Jesse Owens came to Los Angeles in 1935, Booker was one of the community leaders that welcomed him. Booker dabbled in politics as he was listed as a lifetime member of the American Legion and the NAACP. Personal life Booker married Naomi Coalston between 1906 and 1914. They did not have any children. Death Booker died on August 25, 1957 at Good Samaritan Hospital. He was survived by his wife. He was buried in Rosedale Cemetery.

She was the winner of both the Lower Austria Promotion Prize and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art. Early life Erzs√©bet Kiss was born on 18 June 1926 in P√©cs, Kingdom of Hungary. Kiss married Zoltan von Ruttkay in 1943 at the age of 17 and graduated from high school the following year. She studied Hungarian language and literature at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University and later at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest, earning her diploma. Career After graduating, Ruttkay went to work at the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University under professor at the university's Institute for Finno-Ugric Languages, until Zsiray's death in 1955. The following year, she and her husband left Hungary and moved to Austria, where she spent two years as director at the Hungarian Gymnasium in Innsbruck. In 1958, she resumed her studies, under professor at the University of Vienna, studying prehistory, early history and art history. After her matriculation, Ruttkay applied for Austrian citizenship and was naturalized in 1961. The following year, she began working at the in Eisenstadt, where she remained for six years. In 1968, Ruttkay went to work at the Vienna Museum of Natural History, initially inventorying and packaging artifacts for the Prehistoric Department. In 1970, she began archaeological investigations at near M√∂dling, focusing on the Neolithic development of Central Europe. That same year, she wrote a report about a New Stone Age chert mining community at Antonsh√∂he near Mauer, which was one of the first industrial complexes in Lower Austria and the only known deep-shaft mine in the country from the period. In the early 1970s, Ruttkay began excavations at Prellenkirchen, which sparked interest in a systematic evaluation of Austria's Linear Pottery culture (). She coined the term \\"Vornotenkopfkeramik\\" (Before music note ceramics) in 1976, to refer to the oldest LBK groups known in Austria, and it referred to potters who used simple linear decoration, tempering their pots with plant matter. Completing her doctorate in Philosophy 1979, with a dissertation of Das Neolithikum mit bemalter Keramik in √ñsterreich. Eine chronologisch‚Äìkulturhistorische Untersuchung (The Neolithic painted ceramics in Austria. A chronological-cultural-historical study, 1978) from the University of Vienna, Ruttkay continued her research into a time-line for Austrian prehistoric cultures. Her studies included many cultural groups, such as the Moravian-Eastern Austrian Group of painted pottery () in 1979, the Moravian-Austrian Baalberger Group () in 1979 and again in 1989 and the Bronze Age Attersee Group () in 1981, among others. The Attersee Group and Mondsee Culture lived along the lake shores of Upper Austria and their pottery was characterized by designs of arcs, lines and chevron bands, sun discs and triangles. Ruttkay's study of the Mondsee was one of the most relevant works on the culture and established a chronology still in use, which was later confirmed with radiocarbon dating. In 1982, Ruttkay's husband died after a lengthy illness. The following year, she was appointed to the High Counselor of the Prehistory Department, becoming the director of the library at the museum. In 1983, Ruttkay married the philosopher , one of the main editors for Radio Free Europe, who she had known since her teaching days in Innsbruck. During her tenure as library director, between 4000 and 5000 new books were added to the collection on prehistoric topics. She retired from the Department in 1991, but continued her research, completing analysis of the Wachberg phase () in 1995 and Neusiedl phase () in 2002. Until her death, she continued publishing works on Austrian cultural development. Death and legacy Grave of Elisabeth Ruttkay, Feuerhalle Simmering, Vienna Prehistory professor dubbed Ruttkay the \\"grande dame of Austrian Neolithic research\\". Her contributions to the study of the Austrian Neolithic Age were recognized by many awards including receipt of the Lower Austria Promotion Prize (), which recognizes contributions to the development of Lower Austria, in 1987 and receipt of the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art the following year.

Cyber risk quantification is the process of evaluating the cyber risks that have been identified and then validating, measuring and analyzing the available cyber data using mathematical modeling techniques to accurately represent the organization's cybersecurity environment in a manner that can be used to make informed cybersecurity infrastructure investment and risk transfer decisions. Cyber risk quantification is a supporting activity to cybersecurity risk management; cybersecurity risk management is a component of enterprise risk management and is especially important in organizations and enterprises that are highly dependent upon their information technology (IT) networks and systems for their business operations. One method of quantifying cyber risk is the value- at-risk (VaR) method that is discussed at the January 2015 World Economic Forum meeting (see external reference below). At this meeting, VaR was studied and researched and deemed to be a viable method of quantifying cyber risk. Tools Cyber-Risk Quantification can be an automated or software supported process allowing Users to construct mathematical models to quantify Cyber- Security risks; examples are: * Statistical Mechanics & Probability Theory Mathematical definition The mathematical definition of Cyber-Risk is as follows: * Cyber-Risk = 1 - Cyber-Confidence 'Cyber-Confidence' is / are the actual executed tests which have passed. This value can be converted to a statistical probability & the associated Cyber-Risk calculated: * Example-1: 'A certain number' of tests have been executed & passed. Let's imagine that it yields a Defect-Free Confidence of 97.43%. Answer: Cyber-Risk = 2.57%. * Example-2: All 65,536 TCP ports & 65,536 UDP ports are confirmed to be dead or inactive on an asset; how resistant to penetration is it ? Answer: Cyber- Confidence = 99.83%, Cyber-Risk = 0.17% Typically, this form of Cyber- Confidence &/or Cyber-Risk estimation is termed Testimation because: * It can be applied to estimate the number of tests required for any desired level of Cyber-Confidence * It can be applied to estimate the Cyber-Confidence (& Cyber-Risk) based upon the number of tests which have actually been executed & passed See also * Center for Internet Security * ISO/IEC 27001 * ISO/IEC 27002 * NIST Cybersecurity Framework ReferencesExternal links * World Economic Forum: Partnering for Cyber Resilience - Towards the Quantification of Cyber Threats * Category:Risk management Category:Computer security Category:Risk analysis ","title":"Cyber risk quantification"},{"id":"52106704","text":"These are the 1975 Five Nations Championship squads: England Head coach: John Burgess # Bill Beaumont # Neil Bennett # Mike Burton # Martin Cooper # Fran Cotton (c.) # Peter Dixon # David Duckham # Nigel Horton # Tony Jorden # Alan Morley # Tony Neary # Alan Old # Jacko Page # Peter Preece # John Pullin # Chris Ralston # Andy Ripley # Dave Rollitt # Peter Rossborough # Keith Smith # Steve Smith # Peter Squires # Brian \\"Stack\\" Stevens # Roger Uttley # Peter Warfield # John Watkins # Jan Webster France Head coach: Jean Desclaux # Richard Astre # Jean-Luc Averous # Jean-Louis Azarete # Jean-Pierre Bastiat # Roland Bertranne # Victor Boffelli # Jack Cantoni # G√©rard Cholley # Claude Dourthe (c.)** # Alain Esteve # Jean-Martin Etchenique # Jacques Fouroux (c.)* # Jean-Fran√ßois Gourdon # Alain Guilbert # Jean-Pierre Lux # Alain Paco # Lucien Paries # Jean-Pierre Rives # Jean-Pierre Romeu # Olivier Saisset # Fran√ßois Sangalli # Georges Senal # Claude Spanghero # Jean-Claude Skrela # Michel Taffary # Jean-Louis Ugartemendia # Armand Vaquerin * captain in the first game Ireland Head coach: Roly Meates # Roger Clegg # Seamus Dennison # Willie Duggan # Anthony Ensor # Mike Gibson # Tom Grace # Moss Keane # Ken Kennedy # Willie John McBride (c.) # Billy McCombe # Stewart McKinney # Roy McLoughlin # Arthur McMaster # Dick Milliken # John Moloney # Michael Sherry # Fergus Slattery # Pa Whelan Scotland Head coach: Bill Dickinson # Ian Barnes # David Bell # Mike Biggar # Gordon Brown # Sandy Carmichael # Lewis Dick # Andy Irvine # Wilson Lauder # David Leslie # Nairn MacEwan # Duncan Madsen # Alastair McHarg # Ian McGeechan # Ian McLauchlan (c.) # Doug Morgan # Jim Renwick # Billy Steele Wales Head coach: John Dawes # Phil Bennett # John Bevan # Roger Blyth # Terry Cobner # Gerald Davies # Mervyn Davies (c.) # Gareth Edwards # Trefor Evans # Charlie Faulkner # Steve Fenwick # Ray Gravell # Allan Martin # Graham Price # Mike Roberts # Derek Quinnell # Geoff Wheel # J.J.

WRG primarily delivers its services from its Operations Center located in Anaheim, California. History Wescom Resources Group was formed in 2002 as a CUSO of Wescom Credit Union to supply credit unions seeking similar technology products that Wescom Credit Union had developed for its membership. Initially, the CUSO's products and services included Online Banking, Bill Pay, Automated Lending, and New Member Application. Each of these leveraged Wescom's use of integration techniques to the Episys host financial system from Symitar, now a division of Jack Henry, Inc. In addition, the CUSO offered a hosted Service Bureau platform for some of its initial clients. The first services Wescom Resources Group (WRG) offered to credit unions in the Southern California area was ATM Deposit Processing, with Kinecta FCU being WRG's first ATM Deposit Processing client in October 2002. In 2003, John Best joined WRG to lead development projects in home electronic banking, and by 2009 led the WRG development team to completing its first mobile banking app. Wescom was among the first credit unions to deploy a native smart phone app on the then nascent Android operating system. Best formed the WRG Mobile Advisory Group consisting of a small number of prominent credit unions to foster additional collaboration between WRG and its clients. In 2014, Best left WRG. In 2007, WRG appointed Tim Dolan to become its second president. This coincided with WRG‚Äôs acquisition of eCU Technologies, a competing CUSO owned and operated by Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union. The acquisition increased WRG‚Äôs client base of Online Banking clients and expanded its geographic footprint along the eastern coast of the U.S. From 2007 to 2017, Dolan oversaw WRG as it incrementally grew to approximately $12 million in annual fee income. In 2010, WRG formed a new partnership with Corelation, a new financial core to further develop product integration techniques in the credit union industry. Since the launch of this partnership, WRG has grown its Service Bureau platform, based on Corelation's Keystone host processing system. By 2013, WRG served approximately 260 credit unions with a variety of products and services including digital channel products, as well as a number of ancillary products which have since been discontinued ‚Äì including Automated Lending, Remote Deposit, CRM, and a number of internal system programming and information processing utilities. In 2014, the CUSO's management shifted its focus to a smaller subset of products and invested more heavily in digital online channels and its Service Bureau business. This resulted in a reduction to approximately 130 active customer relationships (as of July 2016), and an increase in revenue to approximately $12 million per year. Operating in the financial technology industry, also known as \\"FinTech\\", WRG competed with a large number of other entities, both publicly and privately held companies of various sizes. In August 2019, WRG announced the sale of its digital online channel products, named Symmetry eBanking, to Connect Financial Software Solutions, a privately-held LLC headquartered in the Provo, UT area. In conjunction with the sale, a majority of WRG‚Äôs employees and all the Symmetry client relationships were assigned to Connect. Around the time of this sale, WRG appointed Mr. Dave Cerwinski to become its new president, a role which he serves in presently. The sale of Symmetry eBanking marked a strategic shift to focus the CUSO strictly on delivery of two products ‚Äì the Service Bureau, which by then had grown to over 40 clients, and Tellergy, a software product designed for branch POS terminals. As of August 2020, the CUSO serves a total of 79 clients nationwide, with assets ranging from $50 Million to over $7 Billion. Services Wescom Resources Group's flagship product, Unitri Service Bureau, delivers outsourced core processing, back-office automation, network and application connectivity, and data storage, backup and security to its client credit unions. The platform operates on two third-party host processing systems ‚Äì Keystone, by Corelation Inc. and Episys, by Symitar,a division of Jack Henry & Associates. WRG provides Unitri Service Bureau data processing to approximately 40 credit unions. Tellergy, WRG's most recent product, is an interactive teller station application that resides on a multimedia digital display device from Verifone.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Additional documentation for the district was approved by the National Park Service on January 4, 2019. At the time of its nomination it contained 177 resources, which included 100 contributing buildings, one contributing site, one contributing structure, five contributing objects, 64 non-contributing buildings, three non- contributing structures, and three non-contributing objects. The district covers the city's central business district, mainly along Central Avenue, but also along the adjoining streets as well. Commercial development in the district began with the city's original plat in 1854 and continued through the opening of the Crossroads Mall in 1964. Webster County Courthouse (1902), First National Bank Building (1908), and the Wahkonsa Hotel (1910) are all located in the district and are individually listed on the National Register. Buildings usage in the district varies widely and includes commercial, light industrial, residential, religious, governmental, social, and educational functions. There is also a wide variety of architectural styles that reflect the era in which the buildings were constructed. The oldest building in the district is the Reynolds Block (1882) which marks the transition of the business district from the wood frame structures of its settlement period to masonry constriction. A building boom in the early 20th-century replaced many of the cities older commercial buildings. Building heights range from single story structures to eight stories. Two prominent Des Moines architectural firms, Liebbe, Nourse & Rasmussen and Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson, designed buildings in the district, as did several other architects. The contributing site is the Public Square, the contributing structure is the foundation of a building that was torn down, and the contributing objects include two memorials/drinking fountains and three neon signs.

Main characters=Ami Onuki : Voiced by Janice Kawaye Ami Onuki, the older one of the duo is depicted in the show as a 16-year old peppy, optimistic, and cute girl with rose hair and eyes. She favors bubblegum pop and wears a 1960s go-go dress, also sporting a flower in her hair and white knee-high go-go boots. As the optimist, Ami always looks on the bright side of things and finds a solution to every situation (being two years older and more mature). Ami can drive the tour bus, talk to bees, make a huge mess and clean in the form of a tornado, and play her drums with her bare feet, as seen in both \\"Ami Goes Bad\\" and \\"Mean Machine\\". Ami can crush a handheld gaming device with her hand as seen in The Legend of Mei Pie. She is also a ninja like Yumi in \\"Ninjcompoop\\", though not as skillful or as Yumi (Which leads to her ultimate demise later). Ami can also throw things far away as seen in \\"Gridiron Maidens\\", due to always pounding on the drums. Yumi Yoshimura : Voiced by Grey DeLisle Yumi Yoshimura, the younger of the duo, is depicted in the show as a 14-year old cynical, sarcastic punk rocker with lavender hair and blue eyes. She dresses in a heavy metal/grunge/goth style with studded necklaces and bracelets, a light purple T-shirt with a skull that has the same facial expressions as she does and seems to have a mind of its own, a black miniskirt, purple bike shorts, and black army boots. Being younger, Yumi is also more impetuous than Ami and rushes headlong into a decision before thinking. However, Yumi has a mature side, too, and sometimes reasons with Ami's childish obsessions, although she herself is two years younger. Yumi loves things like ninjas, monster trucks, car crushers and anything else rough and tough. In the episode \\"Opera Yumi\\", it is shown that she was an opera singer since birth, but rebelled to pursue her interest in rock music. She also commonly disrespects Kaz. In some episodes she can be seen biting her nails intentionally or not. Yumi can also drive the tour bus, understand animals, eat a lot of food if she's very bored and make a huge mess like Kaz and Ami. Yumi is also a fighter and at times, a ninja due to her training in \\"Ninjcompoop\\". Yumi would never make an appearance in a Cartoon Network show after the show's cancellation until 2018, when she later appeared as a cameo in the OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes episode \\"Crossover Nexus\\", alongside Robot Jones (from Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?), Chowder and Schnitzel (from Chowder), Festro (from Secret Mountain Fort Awesome), Moxy (from The Moxy Show), Ilana (from Sym-Bionic Titan), High-Five Ghost (from Regular Show), and Weasel (from I Am Weasel). Kazuo \\"Kaz\\" Harada : Voiced by Keone Young Kaz Harada is the duo's well-intentioned yet money-grubbing manager, whose successes are usually balanced out by his foolish decisions. His appearance and name are based on Puffy AmiYumi's real-life manager, Kaz Harada. Veteran character actor Keone Young provides his voice. He is also a huge fan of sumo wrestling, as seen in the episode \\"Sumo Kaz\\". Recurring characters *Jang- Keng (voiced by Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (voiced by Janice Kawaye) are Yumi's and Ami's pet cats, respectively. Jang-Keng (sometimes called \\"Jengo\\") is a black cat and Tekirai (\\"Teki\\" for short) is a fluffy white cat. The girls adore their cats, but Kaz is a constant victim of their mischief. *Harmony (voiced by Sandy Fox) is the self-proclaimed \\"Number One Fan\\" of the girls and of Kaz by the end of the episode \\"Dis-Harmony\\" and in \\"Fan Clubs\\". She is a six-year-old psycho girl who is so obsessed with the duo that she follows it around the world, annoying Ami and Yumi to no end. At the end of her first appearance, she becomes obsessed with Kaz's singing and this becomes a running gag in some episodes, appearing from nowhere and telling Kaz she is his #1 fan. *Wall (voiced by Will Ryan) is a hulking yet slow-witted man hired by Kaz as the girls' bodyguard. He is overprotective, pummeling anyone with whom Ami and Yumi attempt to make contact. He also speaks in the 3rd person. Kaz later hired him as a bouncer for a party he was throwing and, more recently, Ami had him try being a roadie. He later appeared in the unaired episode \\"Sound Off\\". *Domo (voiced by Keone Young) is Kaz's dog. He looks much like his owner, even sharing a similar style of glasses (Kaz is the only one who doesn't see the resemblance). Like Kaz, he is constantly in conflict with the cats, especially since he enjoys eating their food. *Talent Suckers are a vampire rock trio from Transylvania who first appeared in the eponymous episode, \\"sucking\\" Ami and Yumi's talent from them. They returned in three other episodes. The straight man of the trio is Vlad (Nathan Carlson), a tall vampire who speaks with a Transylvanian accent. The second band member is a short vampire, Nicolai (Corey Burton), who is easily made nervous. (A running gag has Vlad slapping Nicolai back to his senses.) The third Talent Sucker is Mitch (also voiced by Nathan Carlson), a vampire who does not talk, but instead grunts and groans. Minor characters *Eldwin Blair (voiced by Nathan Carlson) is a sinister land developer, and the antagonist in the two episodes in which he appears. He usually tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs. *King Chad (voiced by Katie Leigh) is \\"a bad boy super hunk\\", as once described by Ami and Yumi. He is obsessed with the card game Stu-Pi-Doh! (a parody of Yu-Gi-Oh!) and thinks highly of himself. In \\"Janice Jealous\\", he had a girlfriend named Janice who shared his interests in video games, yo-yo tricks, and comics. True to his name, King Chad wears a fur-lined cape and gold crown, and sits on a beautifully-adorned throne. In the episode \\"Janice Jealous\\", the character King Chad goes out with is based on Janice Kawaye, Ami's voice actress. She also voiced the character Janice. *Atchan (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a character Ami and Yumi met at Camp Youwannasushi. He thinks he is a superhero. He is based on Vo Atsushi, the lead singer of the J-Pop band New Rote'ka who is friends with the real-life Yumi Yoshimura and made two cameos in the series last season's live-action sequences. Atchan constantly refers to himself in the 3rd person. Before becoming a superhero, Atchan's face resembles Mac from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. After he declares himself a hero, his looks change to look more like Kamen Rider's. He has a painted star over his right eye resembling that of Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley. *Julie (voiced by Lara Jill Miller) is Yumi's friend in the episode \\"Julie AmiYumi\\", which was not aired in the United States. She is a former band member whose signature color is green and she plays a keyboard guitar. She treats Yumi kindly, but is always mean to Ami. In the episode, she tries to take out Ami and Yumi as revenge for them stealing the stardom which she believed to be rightfully hers. She could not remember Ami's name and called her Arthur. At the end when she is standing in the rain she swore revenge. *Janice (voiced by Janice Kawaye) is a girl King Chad dates in \\"Janice Jealous\\". *Team Teen is a trio of superheroes. The members are Jarhead (voiced by Nathan Carlson), Prom Queen, and Pizza Face. They appear in the Team Teen episode. In the episode, they appeared and tried to stop Mega Bully from harassing the kids at the park. They made Ami and Yumi part of the team when they accepted the offer. Ami became Pom Pom, given her a cheerleader-styled heroine costume with powerful \\"Whirling Pom Poms of Power\\". Yumi became The Rebel, complete with a biker-styled outfit, tall hair, and a supersonic switchblade boomerang comb. After working with the team, Ami and Yumi find out that Team Teen is not that good of a superhero team. They were going to quit at that time, but Jarhead calls them because Mega Bully returned and attacked them. Ami and Yumi fought Mega Bully but had trouble the first time, so they won fighting their own way. Even though they saved the team, Jarhead fires Ami and Yumi for using violence to stop Mega Bully and popping his costume. Ami and Yumi don't care because they didn't want the team's \\"super squareness\\" to rub off of them. The team was last seen comforting Mega Bully. Team Teen is a pun for \\"Teen Titans\\", another show that Puffy AmiYumi sang the theme song and played K2G for.

His podcast, \\"The Basement Yard\\", has reached #1 on iTunes.  Early life  Santagato was born and raised in Queens, New York, United States. He is of maternal Irish descent and paternal Italian descent. His mother, Elizabeth, was a public school secretary and his father, Joseph, was a firefighter for the New York City Fire Department. He has three older siblings, Thomas, Keith and Shannon. Thomas is a former Team USA athlete and national skeleton champion, and Keith had a gaming YouTube channel from 2015 to 2017 with over 100,000 subscribers. Santagato attended the St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School, Louis Armstrong Middle School, and St. Francis Preparatory School, where he was a wide receiver for the championship-winning football team. He enjoyed playing basketball. Santagato later attended Queensborough Community College but dropped out, instead working as a pizza delivery boy and waiter while growing his YouTube channel. Santagato began to produce video content at the age of 13, focusing on short movies, sketches and song parodies. He joined YouTube after a suggestion from a friend to post videos online, using the moniker 'SantagatoTV'. Santagato has credited comedians like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Robin Williams as his major comedic influences. He has also named Jenna Marbles as an early influence on his Youtube channel. Career Before pursuing YouTube full-time, Santagato worked as a producer and editor for American online news platform Elite Daily. At this time, Santagato had a YouTube channel titled \\"SantagatoTV\\" and a popular self-titled Vine account. In May 2014, he renamed his YouTube channel to the current \\"Joe Santagato\\". His Vine account went inactive in 2016 when Vine permanently ended uploads. In 2016, Santagato collaborated with actor and wrestler The Rock in their YouTube show titled Rock The Promo. Santagato's \\"Speak Out\\" game In August 2016, Santagato helped to create the Hasbro board game Speak Out in which players recite phrases with a dental retractor placed in their mouth while other players try to guess the phrase which is being said. The game is based on Santagato's \\"Watch Ya' Mouth\\" series. Santagato worked with Hasbro to help promote the game on their social media. Hasbro has also released Speak Out:Joe Santagato Edition, which contains phrases written by Santagato, and is more explicit than the original version. Santagato is also a promoter of Hasbro's Hearing Things board game, based on Santagato's \\"Whad'ya Say\\" series, in which headphones are placed on one player's ears, and another player recites phrases while the first player guesses the phrase based on lip movement. In October 2017, Santagato announced that he had collaborated with two coworkers from his former workplace, Elite Daily, to introduce a new telecommunications company called Wing. The company uses Sprint Corporation's cellular towers and offers tiered and unlimited data options for consumers. The company is unique in the sense that customers are reimbursed for data that is not used from their selected plan during their billing cycle. Taxes are listed as \\"five to ten percent\\" of a customer's bill, based on location. Santagato hosts a weekly podcast called \\"The Basement Yard.\\" The podcast frequently features visitors such as Frank Alvarez, Anthony Davino and Danny Lopriore. Frank Alvarez has since become a permanent co-host of the show. He also has a podcast with Greg Dybec titled \\"Other Peoples Lives\\".

He was popular with the students, a professor of history and English, secretary of the faculty, and librarian. In 1898, Holmes led a group of black Baptists in an attempt to remove Institute president George Sale from his position in favor of a black candidate. The attempt failed and Holmes moved to Macon, Georgia where he opened Central City College.Rouse, Jacqueline Anne. Lugenia Burns Hope, Black Southern Reformer.

Love, a preacher from Savannah, Georgia, who organized the purchase of the college land. The school grew quickly and by the third year, 365 students were enrolled. Holmes modeled Central City after the England liberal arts education he himself had received, in contrast to Booker T. Washington's industrial education model. Holmes expected a number of faculty and students to follow him, but that did not come to pass. James M.

He made twenty-nine films, including L'amour fou (1969), Out 1 (1971), Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974), and La Belle Noiseuse (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Rivette's films explore themes such as conspiracy theories and theatricality in daily life. His frequent combination of conspiratorial crime stories and carefree characters has led him to be compared to Louis Feuillade, Howard Hawks, and Jean Renoir. Rivette is also lauded for his complex female characters, leading some of his films to be regarded as forefathers of the female buddy film. Critic David Thomson famously called Celine and Julie Go Boating \\"the most innovative film since Citizen Kane...whereas Kane was the first film to suggest that the world of the imagination was as powerful as reality, Celine and Julie is the first film in which everything is invented.\\" Other scholars who have written extensively about Rivette include Jonathan Rosenbaum and H√©l√®ne Frappat. Themes Rivette's films, often with themes involving mysteries and conspiracy theories, rely on improvisation. Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \\"Every Rivette film has its Eisenstein/Lang/Hitchcock side‚Äîan impulse to design and plot, dominate and control‚Äîand its Renoir/Hawks/Rossellini side: an impulse to 'let things go', open one's self up to the play and power of other personalities, and watch what happens\\". The director's use of improvisation resulted from his negative experience filming The Nun and seeing Jean Rouch's cin√©ma-v√©rit√© documentaries, particularly his in-depth interview with Jean Renoir while making Jean Renoir, le patron. According to Rivette, he was not comfortable with his work until he made L'Amour fou. Describing his difficulties in shooting The Nun and finding his own cinematic style, he said: \\"Sometimes it is necessary to go a very long distance out of your way in order to come back a short distance correctly\\". Rivette wrote a ten-page outline for L'amour fou, which he developed with Maril√π Parolini and the actors before production began. He and Parolini then wrote a thirty-page \\"calendar\\" of events outlining the characters' actions, giving the actors control of their actions and dialogue during production. Rivette said, \\"What was exciting was creating a reality which began to have an existence on its own, independently of whether it was being filmed or not, then to treat it as an event that you're doing [as] a documentary\\". He continued using varieties of improvisation throughout his career. Parolini said that for Love on the Ground they wrote \\"a biographical sheet for each of the characters and a list of numbered scenes providing a course of action, mostly related to the shooting schedule\\". Rivette would then rehearse improvised scenes with the actors and collaborate with Parolini, Suzanne Schiffmann and Pascal Bonitzer on a script based on their improvisation. Bonitzer said that he \\"conceived of work as a kind of game; he no longer wanted total improvisation and at the same time wanted the intrigue itself loosened up somewhat, only slightly defined\\" and called his method \\"th√©√¢tre d'appartement.\\" While interviewing Renoir, Rivette was inspired by his subject's relationship with the actors on set and his willingness to allow them to improvise (creating a higher form of realism). According to Rivette, Jean-Andr√© Fieschi has theorized that Rivette was influenced by a 1964 Cahiers interview he conducted with composer Pierre Boulez. Boulez said that his compositions were \\"guided by chance\\" and \\"a kind of labyrinth ... with a number of paths.\\" Film criticism Serge Daney said that Rivette's writing style \\"was by far the most forceful of anyone writing at that time\\". According to Rivette, his assertiveness \\"matched my character\\". Truffaut wrote, \\"His articles are the most comprehensive and the best that have ever been published in Cahiers.\\" Antoine de Baecque said, \\"His articles are often the most carefully thought out, and provide the most elegant formulation of some of the Cahiers fundamental beliefs regarding cinema.\\" Douglas Morrey wrote, \\"Rivette's articles on films are both verbose and incisive, at the same time carefully worked-out analyses and blunt statements of adoration.\\" Rivette championed American directors such as Howard Hawks, John Ford, Nicholas Ray and Fritz Lang and international directors such as Roberto Rossellini and Kenji Mizoguchi. He was highly critical of established qualit√© fran√ßaise directors such as Claude Autant-Lara, Henri-Georges Clouzot and Rene Clement, writing that they were afraid to take risks and were corrupted by money. Although Rivette admired Andr√© Bazin, describing him as \\"the only person I'd met who gave me a feeling of sainthood\\", his writing was sometimes at odds with Bazin's philosophies on realism and formalism. He was also influenced by Truffaut's auteur theory and his 1954 article, \\"A Certain Trend of French Cinema\\", which criticized the artificial theatricality and staged appearance of many films. Rivette agreed with Truffaut's theories, even though nearly all his films revolved around a theatrical production. According to Rivette, \\"All films are about the theatre; there is no other subject ... the subject of truth and lies ... Performance is the subject. Taking it as the subject of a film is being frank\\". Jacques Aumont said that Rivette used theater and its portrayal to achieve \\"a true realism\\" in films, and Wiles calls his theatricality \\"an implicit response to Bazin\\". Rivette rejected the auteur theory, calling it a myth: \\"There is no auteur in films ... a film is something which preexists in its own right. It is only interesting if you have this feeling that the film preexists and that you are trying to reach it, to discover it, taking precautions to avoid spoiling it or deforming it\\". According to Tesi di Laurea, Rivette's use of improvisation \\"is based on the idea to get rid of the author and director, [and] is made possible only by the network of collaborators that the director has woven around himself ... The figure of the author, rather than disappear, is blown up and, once fragmented, is embodied in a number of people, interacting with each other, creating day by day the scaffolding on which the film is constructed\\". Rivette said, \\"If cinema has a social function it's really to make people confront other systems of thought, or other systems of living than the ones they habitually know.\\" Rivette was also influenced by Rohmer's film criticism, specifically his praise of modernity. Influences and frequent collaborators Michel Marie has compared the city shots in Paris Belongs to Us to scenes in Louis Feuillade's Les Vampires and Ren√© Clair's Paris qui dort, and the film's vague secret police to Doctor Mabuse in Fritz Lang's films. Marie wrote, \\"Rivette's Paris is an obscure maze, where intricate conspiracies are hatched by the vague Organization, a lucid premonition of the French Organization of the Secret Army (OAS). All of the characters feel threatened.\\" James Monaco and Roy Ames criticized Rivette's view as too theatrical. Another major influence on Rivette's work was Jean Cocteau, who inspired him to become a filmmaker. Rivette became close to Cocteau near the end of the older man's life, developing what Wiles called a filial relationship. The themes and tone of Noroit were a partial homage to Cocteau's work on Pell√©as et M√©lisande; Duelle makes direct references to Blood of a Poet and Les Chevaliers de la Table ronde, and Celine and Julie Go Boating was influenced by Orph√©e He worked with a number of actors (Jeanne Balibar, Emmanuelle B√©art, Juliet Berto, Jane Birkin, Sandrine Bonnaire, Sergio Castellitto, Geraldine Chaplin, Laurence C√¥te, Marianne Denicourt, Nicole Garcia, Anna Karina, Andr√© Marcon, Bulle Ogier, Michel Piccoli, Jerzy Radziwilowicz and Nathalie Richard) on multiple films. Rivette also worked repeatedly with writers and technicians, such as Charles Bitsch, Pascal Bonitzer, Claire Denis, Eduardo de Gregorio, Jean Gruault, Christine Laurent, Nicole Lubtchansky, William Lubtchansky, Maril√π Parolini and Suzanne Schiffman. The director worked with editor Nicole Lubtchansky on all his films beginning with L'amour fou. Rivette liked long takes because \\"they're more enjoyable to do, [and] the actors like them better\\", but Paris Belongs to Us had fast-paced editing and an average shot length of twelve seconds. Beginning with Duelle, Rivette worked with Lubtchansky's husband William, as cinematographer on nearly all his films. Rivette and William Lubtchansky did not plan the film's look in advance, collaborating on set after Rivette had rehearsed with the actors. According to Dave Kehr, \\"With Mr. Lubtchansky present, he would run through the scene several times, and then consult with his cinematographer to choose the camera angles and lighting schemes he believed most appropriate to the material\\". Lubtchansky's cinematography varied in the films, and Rivette never developed the signature visual style of other directors. Kehr described Lubtchansky's work in Le Pont du Nord as \\"fluid, sunny images\\" and The Duchess of Langeais as having a \\"dark, heavy, almost Germanic manner\\". Ronald Bergan praised Lubtchansky's cinematography on Duelle and Noro√Æt for its \\"fluid camerawork, superb long takes and an atmospheric use of understated blues and reds\\", and said that Lubtchansky was \\"attuned to the director's sudden, intuitive changes and improvisations\\". Rivette also worked with Lubtchansky's daughter, Irina, who was co-cinematographer on 36 vues du Pic Saint Loup. David Thomson wrote that Rivette \\"always preferred a camera style that has the best of two of his gods ‚Äî the detachment and flow of Renoir, with the classical form and control of Fritz Lang\\". Legacy Rivette is considered one of the more experimental of the French New Wave directors; during the 1970s, Godard said: \\"Someone like Rivette who knows cinema so much better than I, shoots seldom, so people don't speak of him ... if he had made 10 films he would have gone much farther than I\\". According to film critic Rapha√´l Bassan, Rivette was \\"the only filmmaker of the ex-New Wave‚Äîalong with Godard‚Äîwho keeps making truly personal work on the level of film, while his colleagues from the early days have long rejoined the ranks of the qualit√© fran√ßaise [mainstream French films]\\". Marc Chevrie called Rivette \\"vaguely legendary but largely unknown\\". Josh Kupecki of The Austin Chronicle sees his influence on the films of Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry. American poet John Ashbery called Out 1 \\"the greatest film ever made\\". He was awarded the Pardo d‚Äôonore for his career achievements at the 1991 Locarno International Film Festival. David Thomson, a longtime champion of Rivette's work, called him \\"one of the great directors working\\" and considered L'amour fou, Celine and Julie Go Boating and both versions of Out 1 \\"masterpieces\\" in 2001. C√©line and Julie Go Boating has influenced several films, according to Dennis Lim, including Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan and Sara Driver's Sleepwalk. The film was referred to in Erick Zonca's 1998 The Dreamlife of Angels. That year Entertainment Weekly ranked it 99th on a list of 100 greatest films ever made, and Thomson called it \\"the most innovative film since Citizen Kane\\". Lim also saw the film's influence in the films of David Lynch, such as Lost Highway, Mullholland Drive and Inland Empire. In December 2015 the Film Society of Lincoln Center screened a retrospective that paired the film of Lynch and Rivette. The Lincoln Center wrote that their films both included \\"secrets, conspiracies, and paranoia; women in trouble; the supernatural manifesting itself within the everyday; the nature of performance and the stage as an arena for transformation; the uncanny sense of narrative as a puzzle without a solution, a force with a life of its own.\\" Rivette said that he admired John Cassavetes, Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph for their rapport with actors, and Peter Brook's theatrical work inspired him early in his career. In a 1998 interview with Les Inrockuptibles, the director was blunt about several films and filmmakers. He praised Rossellini's Europa 51, Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter, Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers and Showgirls: \\"It has great sincerity and the script is very honest, guileless\\". Rivette criticized Michael Haneke's Funny Games, Chabrol's Rien ne va plus, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve and James Cameron's Titanic: \\"Cameron isn't evil, he's not an asshole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag. On top of which the actress is awful, unwatchable\\".

He was president of the A. F. Shapleigh Hardware Company, which by the 1880s grew to be one of the largest wholesale hardware firms west of the Mississippi River. He was also involved in a number of other business endeavors in the banking, mining, and insurance industry. Life Shapleigh was the son of Captain Richard Waldron Shapleigh and Dorothea Blaisdell Shapleigh. His father was captain of the Granville. In 1813, at the age of 37, Captain Richard Shapleigh died at sea with his ship, which was wrecked off Rye Beach, New York. In 1843, Shapleigh founded one of the first hardware stores in St. Louis on behalf of Rogers, Field & Company. The following year the company was renamed Rogers, Shapleigh & Company. The original store was a four-story building at 412-422 Main Street. The site was chosen for its proximity to the Mississippi River, which was the main source of transportation for goods at the time. Aside from his connection with the hardware industry, Shapleigh was associated with various other business concerns all of which constitute elements in the development of St. Louis. In 1859, he became identified with the State Bank of St. Louis and in 1862 was elected a director of the Merchant's National Bank, so continuing until 1890, when he resigned in favor of his son Alfred. He was also president of the Phoenix Insurance Company, vice president of the Covenant Mutual Life Insurance Company. He was also invested in the Hope Mining Company and the Granite Mountain Mining Company. Shapleigh also served as a board director of the Hope Mining Company. Shapleigh died of natural causes at the age of 92. He had been in failing health for many years, but retained his mental faculties. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

Wall (April 21, 1905 ‚Äì January 13, 1997) was an American World War II combat photographer and photographic illustrator. During the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings in Normandy, France, Captain Wall was Commanding Officer of the United States Army's 165th Signal Photo Company. Of the conspicuous heroism Wall displayed to provide much of the Army's initial photographic intelligence in the Omaha Beach landing sector, General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the European Theater of Operations) wrote \\"...a salute to a man whose gallantry, on D-Day, was outstanding on a field when gallantry was the rule.\\" During the pre- and post-World War II periods, Wall was a well-known freelance photographic illustrator and a late member of \\"Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles.\\" His photographs covered six decades, and could be found in international photo salons and well-known magazines such as Time and Life. Notable among his associates were Charles Kerlee and Trevor Goodman.  Early life  Wall was born the third of five children to Dorly Wall (n√©e Burkhardt) and Wilhelm Wall. He grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as a 1st generation German, alongside his four siblings: Arnold, Dorly, William, and Irma. From a young age, Wall had a propensity for the outdoors; he was especially interested in hunting and fishing. Wall attended Washington High School and played the trumpet in the marching band. In the 1926, he moved to Los Angeles with his family, where he worked at the Hollywood YMCA handing out towels and locker keys. His first venture into the world of photography came when he sold pictures of the local basketball team for 25 cents each. Wall then ensued upon a formal study of photography at the Art Center School (now called the Art Center College of Design), paying his own way. He learned from the likes of Albert King, Fred Archer, Will Connell, and Edward Kaminski and studied alongside Wynn Bullock. Wall returned as an instructor before and after World War II.‚ÄúBattle Eye‚Äù By Norman B.

Three months later, when Captain Wall heard news of the impending invasion of Normandy, he volunteered to go in with one of the first waves. The result of the 165th Signal Corp going into Omaha Beach on the first wave eventually lead to the first photos made public of the landing. Wall retired with the rank of Major in 1945.

His tenacity very well may have been the thing that kept him alive, along with his khaki uniform sealing his wounds.Oldfield, Col. Barney, Never Shot in Anger, 1956 /first Edition; page 80 In the pre-operative tent, Wall spoke with the medical officer, Captain Joseph Aprile, who was attempting to save his life, saying the film from his camera needed to get back to headquarters. Finally being assured this would happen, he released the film. The Army Pictorial Service in London received, processed and distributed these photos, the greatest number of pictures released by a single photographer on D-Day.Popular Photography, Nov. 1944, ‚ÄúGI Lenses of Normandy,‚Äù by PVT Edward HuerschTime Magazine, Nov. 6, 1944, p72, ‚ÄúWar Through a Lense‚ÄùUS Camera, Nov. 1944, p32-33, ‚ÄúInvasion Photographer‚Äù Wall's photos showcased the landing crafts of all sizes and shapes approaching the Normandy coast, American assault troops landing on Omaha Beach and moving inland to further strengthen the opposition.Paris Match, (French Magazine) June 1994, for 50 th D- Day Anniversary These photographs would come to be seen by the entire world.US Camera Book 1945, the USA at War, photographs judged by Edward Steichen USNB, page 205 Due to military protocol that no individual soldier get credit, Wall seldom is recognized for taking the first combat photos of the initial invasion. Currently, however, the Omaha Beach Museum, on site, has given him personal credit for his photos. After the landing, Wall was moved from England to Percy Jones Hospital, in Battle Creek, Michigan for further medical service. As his initial leg amputation wasn‚Äôt properly carried out, it was there his leg was re-amputated and a year of physical therapy and healing took place. Wall was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Purple Heart for his services during the Second World War. He retired as a Major in 1945.  Photography career  He‚Äôs had his work featured in various magazines throughout his career, including Collier‚Äôs, Life, American, Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal, and Time. Alongside these publications, his photographs were displayed and honored at international photographic salons from Amsterdam to Zagreb. After WWII, he moved back to Los Angeles and kept busy with advertising photography and story illustration. He reassumed his association with Charles Kerlee until 1947, when Kerlee moved his business to New York City. Wall then decided to pen his own studio in Los Angeles where he specialized in advertising, industrial and story illustration. In 1946, he was sent to photograph Jan DeGraff‚Äôs world-famous Oregon Bulb Farm on assignment for Life Magazine. The magazine published a spectacular double page spread the following April of a field of approximately six million daffodils. This developed into a 35-year friendship with DeGraff, in which he returned each spring to photograph the famous hybrid lilies. This led him to other horticultural assignments and eventually becoming distinguished in this area. Wall gives the rare impression of three dimensions in his photography by blending qualities of light and camera angles. In 1958, the International Communications Foundation sent him to the Middle East to shoot illustrations for a series of informational brochures aimed at ‚ÄúPeace Through Education.‚Äù He traveled for six months through Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, notably spending time with the Nomadic Bakhtiari tribespeople. The photographs from this assignment are still used worldwide. In 1964, Eastman Kodak honored Wall‚Äôs photographs of the hybrid lilies in particular with an exhibition at the New York World‚Äôs Fair with a ‚ÄúSpecial Award for Photographic Excellence,‚Äù making him one of the Top 10 Photographers in the United States, according to Kodak. He was highlighted in a professional journal called ‚ÄúApplied Photography‚Äù and continued his relationship with Kodak and the editor, William A. Reedy. Lilies at the Bulb Farm as featured at the New York World's Fair Wall has a way of gripping the senses with an invisible hand and drawing you to them. He relished in the various seasons and the different stories they told. In fact, he shot the landscapes of the Sierra Nevadas for over forty years, in each of the different seasons. Wall believed that the impact of pictures was not accidental and in fact stated, ‚ÄúYou make up the rules after you shoot the picture. You just know when it‚Äôs right and you shoot it and then you make up the reasons why it works.‚Äù In 1978, he joined with artist Trevor Goodman, who built scale models of barns and buildings of the Old West. Each year, Wall photographed these models and put out a Christmas card. Over the course of his prolific sixty-year career, Wall never left the house without a camera. He has a knack for capturing moments before they are recognized. His photographs from D-Day can now be seen on display with name credit at The Omaha Beach Museum. After all his time on the battlefield and the many years he spent off of it, it certainly can be said that he‚Äôs ‚ÄúGot a good shot.‚Äù Throughout his career, Wall has worked with many famous people in the industry. Among them was William A. Reedy, senior editor of advertising publications for Kodak‚Äôs Professional and Finishing Markets Division and editor of the Kodak quarterly publication, Applied Photography. Reedy and Wall shared a special a special love of the desert and the High Sierras, making these assignments especially fruitful for the pair.  Personal life  Wall met his future wife, Ruth Hawks, at Percy Jones Hospital during the year he spent there in rehabilitation. He was told he‚Äôd never walk again, but eventually he overcame it with the help of a prosthetic leg. Wall moved back to Los Angeles and re- established his partnership with Charles Kerlee. Wall and his wife welcomed their daughter, Katherine Panatone (nee Wall), in 1951. He took special interest in assisting other amputee patients at the UCLA prosthetics department. Wall was so comfortable with his prosthetic that you couldn‚Äôt even tell he was amputated above the knee, he aimed for this level of competency for his fellow amputees as well. Wall as an amputee survivor He returned to the Art Center in Los Angeles (now in Pasadena) to teach architectural lighting.  Death and Commemorations  Wall resided in Los Angeles with his wife and daughter until his death on January 13, 1997. He has been commemorated by the Major Herman V. Wall Memorial Award, which was most recently presented to Matt Hecht via the Eddie Adams Workshop. UC Riverside Museum of California Photography will be working on an archive project to obtain and maintain his photography in a collection. At his memorial service, Wall‚Äôs wife, Ruth, said of her late husband, ‚ÄúIt was like the outdoors was Herman's church. He was truly happy and at peace when he was fishing the headwaters of the Owens River, photographing the snow on the mountains, seeing a rainbow, etc.\\" Ruth Hawks, Herman V. Wall Funeral. Riverside, CA  Awards  Wall was one of the late members of the ‚ÄúCamera Picotrialists of Los Angeles‚Äù in the 1930s. This pioneer photo group was the first to have international salon exhibits in Los Angeles. Due to his connection with this organization, Wall‚Äôs prints were honored at the following national and international photographic salons: Internationale Focus Fotosalon, Amsterdam; International Salon Fotografije, Yugoslavia; Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Museum; Fotosalon van Fotoclub Vooruit, Ghent, Belgium; Philadelphia National, Art Alliance; Toronto Salon of Photography, Toronto, Canada; International Salon, Frankfurt, Germany. In 1936, he was awarded a special Gold plaque in Zagreb, Yugoslavia for his famous print ‚ÄúWeater Beaten‚Äù and several Bronze plaques in Amsterdam in 1936, 1937, and 1938. In 1942, Wall won an award at the Art Directors Club of New York‚Äôs 21st Annual Exhibition for Color Photography in Advertising. General Eisenhower honored Wall with a copy of the book Crusade in Europe, in which he inscribed, ‚ÄúTo Captain Herman Wall‚ÄîWith a salute to a man whose gallantry, on D-Day, was outstanding on a field when gallantry was the rule.\\" - Dwight D.

Biography  His father was a draftsman. While still very young, he was enrolled at the √âcole nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon. At the age of ten, he was assigned to the Special School of Design and studied with Pierre R√©voil until 1813. He received a gold laurel in 1815 and had his first exhibition at the Salon in 1819 with his \\"Interior of a Mechanic's Workshop\\". From that year until 1830, he taught drawing at the Royal College; becoming a Professor in 1820. He was also interested in archaeology and ivory carving. In his historical paintings, he focused on scenes from the Middle Ages. As an illustrator, he produced scenes from the Henriade of Voltaire. In his essay \\"The Painter of Modern Life,\\" critic Charles Baudelaire referred to Trimolet as a \\"chronicler of poverty and the humble life.\\" Occasionally, he worked as an art restorer, focusing especially on the old Dutch Masters. He was an opponent of the prevailing trend for minute detail in paintings and wrote a short poem on the subject in which he singled out Adriaen van der Werff for special praise. Together with his wife, , who was also an artist, he amassed a large collection of paintings and other art objects as well as coins, furniture, jewelry and old weapons. At times, his work apparently suffered from his devotion to this pursuit. Something of a misanthrope, he was always ready to pounce on any merchant whose items were not authentic. After his death, Edma continued collecting. In her will, she left their collection to the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon.

It has smooth grey bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers, and cup-shaped to conical fruit.budsfruit Description Eucalyptus carnei is a tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mostly grey bark, sometimes with up to of crumbly or flaky bark near the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull greyish, lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are dull grey-green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a glaucous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a very short pedicel. Mature buds are not glaucous, but oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. The flowers are creamy white and appear between February and May. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped or conical capsule long and wide with the valves either level with the rim or extending well beyond it. Taxonomy Eucalyptus carnea was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1929 and the description was published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. Gardner found the type specimen near Sandstone in 1927. The specific epithet honours Walter Mervyn Carne, a plant pathologist who was supervisor of fresh fruit and vegetable exports for the Victorian Department of Commerce and Agriculture from 1941 to 1950, and the first botanist to be elected to the position of president of the Royal Society of Western Australia. This species is also a part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Bisectae subsection Glandulosae because the cotyledons are bisected, the buds have a scar on the operculum and the branchlets have oil glands in the pith. Eucalyptus carnei is closely related to only one other species, E. stricklandii, and the two form the series Stricklandianae. Distribution Carne's blackbutt is found in stony skeletal soils, red sand and on rocky laterite. It is distributed through the Goldfields and Mid West regions of Western Australia from east of Meekatharra and Sandstone into the Great Victoria Desert.

The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are glaucous, egg-shaped to oblong, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same green to bluish green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven or nine on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped to pear-shaped or oval, long and wide with a rounded operculum with a small point on the tip, or conical. Flowering occurs between August and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus celastroides was first formally described by Nikolai Turczaninow in 1852 from a specimen collected by James Drummond. The description was published in the journal Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg. The specific epithet (celastroides) is a reference to the genus Celastrus. The ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"likeness\\". In 1986, Ian Brooker described two subspecies in the journal Nuytsia and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus celastroides Turcz. subsp. celastroides has greyish or bluish green leaves and glaucous branchlets, sometimes buds and fruit that are also glaucous; * Eucalyptus celastroides subsp. virella Brooker has green leaves, and the branchlets, buds and fruit are not glaucous. Distribution and habitat Mirret is often found on flat or undulating country where it grows in sandy or clayey soils. Subspecies celastroides has a more easterly distribution than subspecies virella. The former occurs in the goldfields between Kellerberrin and Norseman, extending almost to Balladonia. Subspecies virella occurs mainly in the wheatbelt.

The school was founded in 1877 and is best known for its specialized secondary program in mathematics and its alumni.  History = Founding and School 4 (1877‚Äì1968)  The school circa 1877. In 1877, , a Russian engineer and educator, founded a realschule in Maly Znamensky Lane, which soon became one of the most progressive vocational schools in Russia. After the October Revolution, the realschule was converted into a boarding school with courses in aesthetic arts and renamed to School 4. It became popular with the Soviet establishment, with top government officials sending their children there. In 1936, the school was transformed again, converting back to a vocational school and acquiring the number 57 in Moscow's educational system.  Math classes and new campuses (1968‚Äìpresent)  School 57 today In 1968, Nikolay Konstantinov, a leading Russian educator in mathematics, established specialized math classes at the school. Konstantinov's teaching methodology still is used in these classes to this day and has been shared with other educational centers. The school started gaining prestige due to the quality of education it provided. As of 2016, School 57 is a highly selective school with a competitive admission process. The high school offers specializations in humanities, biology, and mathematics, as well as a general track. In 2008‚Äì2013, the school merged with two other schools in different locations of the Khamovniki District of Moscow, in conformity with the recent reforms in educational policy. Enrollment  The school has a total enrollment of over a thousand students, entering first, eighth and ninth grade. Admission to elementary school is competitive and based on test results of the students previously enrolled in the school's tuition-based mandatory preschool program. In 2015, the admission committee considered over a thousand applicants for 130 positions. By maintaining good standing the students can guarantee their further education in the school's general track middle and high school. As is the tradition in many Russian schools, incoming students are split into a number of groups of 20‚Äì30 which each have their own curricula and teachers. School 57 has general track classes along with its specialized programs and holds a separate admission process for specialized classes in mathematics, humanities and biology, a joint project of the school and the of Moscow State University. The admission committee considers a few hundred applicants for 20‚Äì25 places in each class. School 57 launches two math classes each year, with four- and three-year curriculums, each admitting around 20‚Äì25 students who have demonstrated the best problem-solving abilities during the application process. The school organizes free preparatory courses that help interested students to develop said abilities. A portfolio that includes prizes from math competitions can strengthen an application.  Academics  Students in the specialized classes receive extensive training in their areas of expertise, often covering college-level material in their junior and senior years. Graduates of the specialized classes often go on to pursue college degrees in Russia's best universities, including the Higher School of Economics, Moscow State University, and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  Mathematics classes  Individual approach lies in the core of the specialized math classes' educational process. Teaching the specialized math classes isn't limited to faculty staff ‚Äì additional instructors, many of whom are volunteering alumni, are involved in order to give every student necessary attention. Rather than having to learn the material from a textbook, students discover it through solving sequences of problems. Solutions are presented by the students to the instructors in one-on-one discussions. This method, introduced by Konstantinov, proved to be effective and was adopted by other educational institutions in both Russia and abroad, including School 179, the Independent University of Moscow and the Faculty of Mathematics at Higher School of Economics. Several School 57 teachers have also written textbooks that follow the method. The specialized curriculum includes introductory topics in linear algebra, calculus, set theory, and probability theory. Awards and recognition Classical logo of The Moscow School 57, designed in 1984 by students The school is consistently ranked among the top 10 Russian schools. In 2016, school 57 was ranked fourth in Moscow by the Moscow Department of Education and fifth in Russia by ' (Teacher's Newspaper), the leading educational periodical in Russia. Several teachers from the school received honorary awards, including the President's award. The school was also awarded grants by the George Soros' Open Society Foundations and the American Mathematical Society. In 2016, fifteen students of the school received awards of the All-Russian Mathematical Olympiad.  Extracurricular activities School 57 offers a number of free courses for middle schoolers preparing students who intend to apply to the mathematics, humanities and biology classes. The math program includes weekly problem solving sets for sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders, some of the courses are published. The biology track includes lectures in math, biology and chemistry for eighth graders, and future humanities students study literature and history. All of the courses take place in the first, historical building of the school on Maly Znamensky Lane. The school also offers a number of clubs for students of each of its three buildings, including a chess club, film club, ceramics club, theater club (both puppet theater and drama) and a course preparing for TOEFL and IELTS standardized English tests. Class vacations, including those involving intense work (lectures, presentations, field trips), are popular in the school, though not mandated by the administration. Math classes usually tend to have mountain hiking journeys, while humanities classes organize urban trips, focusing on cultural and historical studies. Since 1996 the school worked together with the Tauric Chersonese museum to organize volunteers from the number of students and alumni to work and learn on different archaeological sites in the area. Open Oral Maths Olympiad School 57 holds an annual math competition for sixth and seventh graders from Moscow schools, sometimes accommodating more than 300 students. During the competition, students interact with professors, as well as mathematics graduate and postgraduate students of Moscow universities. The competition consists of two rounds and a series of lectures on various subjects by school teachers and alumni professors. Summer –úath –°amp Since 2012, the school has been hosting a mathematical summer camp for high school students, where university professors offer a number of introductory courses in different areas of college level mathematics. School 57 students are admitted automatically, students of other Moscow schools receive a spot in the camp based on results of a competition. The Summer –úath –°amp is jointly organized by the school, the Higher School of Economics and Yandex. In 2016, the Summer –úath –°amp had 15 courses and 80 students. The topics covered in the camp's course include the Young tableau, knot invariants and Schubert polynomials. Students who have the School 57 math camp's honors certificate have a better chance at getting into the Higher School of Economics. Collection of graduation pins and badges of Moscow School 57 from 1970s to 2018 Lectorium In September 2016, a series of lectures by notable alumni was launched in a joint effort by the school's alumni and students' parents. Lectures take place in all three buildings of the school, the speakers include and Anatoly Starostin. Lectures vary in format from oral presentations to interactive master classes. Traditions School 57 has a tradition of keeping in touch with its alumni. Every 1st Saturday of February, the school celebrates its birthday, and current students arrange entertainment for the alumni, including refreshments, skits, and games, including . The alumni, in turn, come up with intellectual contests for students.  Logo  Classical School 57 logo contains a mathematical root symbol hidden in its counterform. While the idea of the square root in the school icon existed before, the classical logo was originally designed by the school's students within a logo tender, organized by students in 1984 without the administration involvement. The final classical logo contains elements of work of Misha Ovchinnikov, Nikolai Grigoriev, and Alexander Kulakov. It was used with minor modifications in school collateral materials and graduation pins over decades. The new logo was designed in 2019 as a part of school style update project. Controversies In August 2016, several school graduates publicly accused two school teachers of sexual misconduct and the school administration of deliberate concealment of these misconducts. This scandal led to the retirement of the principal Sergey Mendelevich. The school is still undergoing legal investigation as of November 2016.

It started as an attitude and approach to place-based and land-based education (both largely considered under the umbrella of environmental education) that criticized place-based education's invisible endorsement of colonial narratives and domineering relationships with the land. The scholars critiquing place-based education mainly focused on re-centering Indigenous (and other marginalized) voices in the curriculum. In the early 1990s, C.A. Bowers advocated for a critical pedagogy of place that acknowledged our enmeshment in cultural and ecological systems, and the resulting need for this to figure in the school curriculum. In 2003, David A. Greenwood (formerly Grunewald) introduced and defined the term \\"Critical Pedagogy of Place.\\" In the years since, the general ideas of critical pedagogy of place have been incorporated into many scholars' critiques of place-based, land-based, and environmental education.  Precedents = Indigenous and land-based approaches  At the center of critical pedagogy of place is the critique that land-based education and place-based education have largely ignored the narratives of Indigenous peoples and conceived of humans as mainly separate from nature. For example, stories of eco-heroes such as the Grizzly Man and Into the Wild's main character, Chris, center on humans attempting to overcome, or conquer, nature. Scholars focusing particularly on Indigenous perspectives argue that land- based education and place-based education should instead more fully consider Indigenous ideologies that incorporate humans as part of nature. In order to do this, the colonial constructs inherent within place- and land-based education must be dismantled. In particular, land- and place-education focused on areas settled by non-Indigenous peoples need to better incorporate the decolonization of the land and work to better center Indigenous narratives. This process can be best facilitated by focusing on disrupting the settler colonial narrative in modern contexts, considering land and Indigenous cosmologies in curriculum, and recognizing the significance of naming places and the land rights of Indigenous peoples. Calderon argues that, incorporating a sense of place informed by Indigenous narratives renders the settler colonialism visible. Resulting academic research has illustrated these theoretical underpinnings in a variety of ways. First, scholars have worked to map the path of colonialism in history and its resulting impacts on marginalized groups, thus rendering it visible. McCoy worked to create a map of the rise of the Manifest Destiny ideology in Virginia. Both Paperson and Sato analyzed settler colonialism by mapping the stories of marginalized groups, thus re-centering the narrative history. Second, scholars have worked to illustrate how dismantling the colonialism inherent in land- and place- based education can improve environmental education's effectiveness. In 2014, Whitehouse et al. examined Australian environmental education and demonstrated how the program both holds up colonialist ideals and incorporates Aboroginal knowledge bases. Meyer, also in 2014, did a similar study with a Hawaiian environmental education program that incorporated local Indigenous perspectives. Bang et al., in their work with Native Americans in the U.S., described how a critical land-based perspective can center environmental education for marginalized people. Working from the perspective of African communities, Mauro et al. describes how a local-centered approach can create a more impactful educational experience.  C.A. Bowers  Working in the same tradition of critique, C.A. Bowers focuses on critical pedagogy of place's emphasis on the inclusion of humans within the ecological system. Bowers argues that we cannot base environmental education efforts on the individual because we are nested within culture, which is in turn nested within ecosystems. We are, therefore, inevitably influenced by the culture through which we view the world‚Äîwe view the world through our subconscious cultural habits. With respect to land- and place-based education, this means that they are, therefore, born out of a Western tradition that has ideals in contrast to many local, Indigenous cultures. This sets up an educational approach that is in opposition to nature and instead focuses on monetary profit over community. This results in our ignoring both the ecological crisis and the intergenerational local knowledge that might help us solve it. He was to later respond to David A. Greenwood's theory of a critical pedagogy of place (see below) by arguing that a critical pedagogy of place, in an attempt to decolonize spaces, actually encodes many of the same (universalist) assumptions that also undergird our consumer-dependent world. It ignores the long history of culturally specific inhabitation. He says that the idea of decolonization is a universalizing idea that is in direct opposition to the tenets of local and place-specific knowledge inherent in place-based education: > To reiterate, the key reason that a critical pedagogy of place is an > oxymoron is that the linguistic tradition of relying upon abstractions, > including abstract theories that encode many of the same taken-for-granted > assumptions that underlie both the idea of universal decolonization and the > market liberals‚Äô efforts to universalize the West‚Äôs consumer dependent > lifestyle, fail to take account of the intergenerational traditions of > habitation that still exist in communities. Places have a long and > culturally varied history, while the language of a critical pedagogy of > place has a specific history that carries forward the tradition of ignoring > the diverse ways in which more ecologically centered cultures and community > practices have contributed to long-term habitation of place.  David A. Greenwood  David A. Greenwood is the first scholar to capitalize Critical Pedagogy of Place. He writes that Critical Pedagogy of Place seeks to combine critical pedagogy's emphasis on challenging ‚Äúassumptions, practices, and outcomes taken for granted in dominant culture and in conventional education‚Äù with place-based education's focus on helping students become citizens that understand their actions ‚Äúmight have some direct bearing on the well-being of the social and ecological places people actually inhabit.\\" Greenwood argues that, in the process of raising students‚Äô sense of awareness and consciousness of power structures, critical pedagogy often neglects the idea that ‚Äúhuman culture has been, is and, always will be nested in ecological systems. Because of its focus on oppressed groups, critical pedagogy focuses mainly on social and urban contexts. While this emphasis on raising consciousness is important as a pathway to change, Greenwood argues that it needs to be balanced with place-based education, which emphasizes the direct social and ecological places in which the students actually live out their lives. Thus, he emphasizes the sense of urban as a place, a concept previously missing from critical pedagogy. In order to actualize critical pedagogy, he argues, we cannot forget that the urban space is also a crucial part of critical pedagogy. However, place-based education is often criticized for not having a strong theoretical underpinning. Scholars question the purpose of teaching about local place‚Äîwhat does it actually achieve for the students? Therefore, in turn, critical pedagogy offers place-based education a rich theoretical grounding with its significant history rooted in critical theory. Greenwood suggests that, as a curriculum with goals of social change, this moral grounding is necessary. As a result of combining these two pedagogies, Greenwood suggests two goals for a critical pedagogy of place: decolonization and reinhabitation. In order to decolonize a place, Greenwood suggests that we must ‚Äúidentify and change ways of thinking that injure and exploit other people and places‚Äù (6). Educators can begin this process by helping students unlearn dominant narratives and instead learn about more socially just and sustainable ways of living in the world. This also means reinvigorating non-dominant cultural patterns and traditions. By reinhabitation, Greenwood means that a critical pedagogy of place must seek to teach students how to live in a place that has endured historical exploitation, both socially and ecologically. In order to do this, students must begin to understand how ‚Äúliving well‚Äù differs geographically and culturally while simultaneously beginning to understand how many diverse cultures live in a global society. Then, students will begin to understand ‚Äúwhat cultural patterns should be conserved or transformed to promote more ecologically sustainable communities.\\" These two goals challenge both place- based and critical pedagogy educators to ‚Äúexpand the scope of their theory, inquire, and practice to include the social and ecological contexts of our own and others ‚Äò inhabitance.‚Äù This emphasize creates a pedagogy that is a place of praxis for both ecological and social transformation.  Current approaches = Post-modern directions  Recent scholarship in this field has taken a post-modern perspective on a critical pedagogy of place, calling for the changing of social imaginaries that not only better complicate the relationship between humans and nature, but also focus on a pluralistic view of the world. This includes an increased need to be reflexive and create locally defensible pedagogy, rather than a universalistic pedagogy that is not flexible enough to be re-situated for local communities. This begins, McKenzie argues, with the focus on the intersubjective, or the personal and community- based, experiences of education as much as the sensory or thought-based experiences.  Incorporation of Greenwood  Greenwood's ideas have been both incorporated into research on environmental education, as well as being applied to other critical education approaches. Kayira, in 2015, used Greenwood's guiding questions of \\"'What happened here?' 'What is happening here now and in what direction is this place headed?' and 'What should happen here?'\\" to examine an African-centered approach to environmental education. Madden used the curricular approaches Greenwood outlines to suggest pedagogical pathways to Indigenous education. Barnhardt does a similar exploration with Indigenous knowledges in Alaska. Working to build theory, Ardoin et al. and McInerney et al. examined the scale of place and how place and identity interact in critical pedagogy of place. Writing to practitioners, Martusewicz wrote a book, EcoJustice Education: Toward Diverse, Democratic, and Sustainable Communities that gives practical examples of how to implement Greenwood's theories into practice. Chinn uses Greenwood's ideas to design a teacher training aimed at decolonizing pedagogy Greenwood's theories have also been applied to other education approaches (early childhood curriculum, art education, social studies, and globalizing).  Classroom science education  The problematization of land- and place-based education has recently transferred to a critical examination of science education in schools. Starting from the premise that epistemological orientations impact memory organization, ecological reasoning, and the perceptions of humans in nature, Bang and her colleagues examined how students navigate multiple beliefs in community-based science education. First, they examined the differences between Menominee Native American children and European American children and found that Menominee children were more likely to mention ecological connections and closeness to nature, and were more likely to mimic animals. Using this information, they re-centered the curriculum to include multiple ways of knowing and designed a science curriculum that relied on multiple senses of community, rejected deficit thinking, celebrated heterogeneous sense-making and expanded definitions of nature. Examination of the program led the researchers to suggest that having a diversity of perspectives in science results in more effective science education.

She appeared in five matches during the tournament, being an unused substitute in the semifinal against Great Britain. Her team finished third, earning the bronze medal. Controversy From 2012 to 2016, Nobre made appearances for the Equatorial Guinea women's national football team despite having no connection with the African nation. She was part of the squad that won the 2012 African Women's Championship. According to Federa√ß√£o Paulista de Futebol, based on her original Brazilian nationality, her full name is Camila do Carmo Nobre de Oliveira and she was born on 10 June 1988 in S√£o Paulo. These data do not match the information that Equatorial Guinea had submitted to the CAF on the occasion of the 2012 African Women's Championship. There, based on the Equatoguinean passport that African country gave her, her full name was Camila Maria Nobre de Carmo and her date of birth was 10 July 1994. Also, the list published by CAF reported that at the time she was playing for a local Equatoguinean side, E Waiso Ipola, when in reality she was signed with S√£o Jos√© Esporte Clube in Brazil, having spent all her entire club career in her natal country. She took advantage of her false age to compete in the 2014 African U-20 Women's World Cup Qualifying Tournament. On 11 April 2016, Camila Nobre was sanctioned by FIFA with a ten-match suspension, to be served in the next matches of the representative team of Equatorial Guinea for which she would be eligible, as well as a fine of CHF 2,000, a reprimand and a warning, on the basis of art. 61 paras 1 and 2 of the FDC. On 4 August 2016, her double identity case led CAF to disqualify the Equatorial Guinea national women's team from the Women's AFCON Cameroon 2016, and the subsequent suspensions from the 2018 and 2020 editions. On October 5, 2017, FIFA determined the other ten Brazilian-born footballers who played for Equatorial Guinea at the 2015 CAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament were ineligible.

History Rendering The Jan von Osten House at Amaliegade was purchased by Johan Frederik Classen in 1770. After his death in 1792, the property was taken over by Det Classenske Fideicommis. In the early 1870s, the foundation charged Vilhelm Tvede with the design of a residential project for the garden. He designed a single row of terraced houses inspired by English architecture. It was built in 1873-74. The houses were originally rented out but were sold off individually in the 1970s. Former residents include the architect Hans Munk Hansen. Architecture The terrace consists of nine terraced houses. The main entrances face a courtyard situated between the terrace to the east and the Jan van Osten House to the west. Rach house has an area of approximately 400 square metres and consist of three storeys, attic and basement. The houses were listed in 1978.

It is the third installment in the Fallen film series, following Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and London Has Fallen (2016). The film stars are Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, Jada Pinkett Smith, Lance Reddick, Tim Blake Nelson, Piper Perabo, Nick Nolte, and Danny Huston. The plot again follows United States Secret Service agent Mike Banning as he races against time to clear his name after being framed for a drone attack on the President of the United States, Allan Trumbull. The film was officially announced in October 2016, and Roman Waugh was hired in July 2017. New members of the cast were added in early 2018, and filming began in February of that year around Bulgaria and the United Kingdom. The film was released in the United States on August 23, 2019, by Lionsgate. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $146 million worldwide. Plans for future sequels and TV spin-offs are in development. Plot Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) undergoes training at a military facility in Virginia, owned by his friend and Army Ranger teammate Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), now CEO of private military company Salient Global. He is recommended for the position of Secret Service Director by President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), to replace retiring Director David Gentry (Lance Reddick), but hides the fact that he suffers from migraines and insomnia and takes painkillers to cope with chronic back pain. While Trumbull is on a private fishing trip at Queen's Lake in Williamsburg, Virginia, a swarm of armed drones attack and overwhelm his protection detail, with only Banning surviving and saving the president. Both men are incapacitated, but Banning recovers while Trumbull is left in a coma. FBI special agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) is presented with evidence implicating Banning in the attack, after her team locates the van used to transport the drones and find it containing traces of his hair and DNA, leading to his arrest. En route to a detention facility, Banning's transport is ambushed, but he escapes after killing the assailants and unmasking them as mercenaries from Salient Global with whom he partook in the training exercise. Realizing that Jennings has betrayed and framed him, he calls his wife Leah (Piper Perabo), letting her know he is alive and determined to expose the real perpetrator. The call alerts Thompson to Banning's location, leading to a car chase by numerous police officers. Banning manages to slip away into the night again, and drives away the next morning in a stolen pickup truck to his father's cabin in the backwoods of White Hall, West Virginia. At the White House, Vice President Martin Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson), now acting president, reveals to the press that Banning is responsible for the assassination attempt with support from the Russian government. Banning and his father Clay (Nick Nolte) observe Salient mercenaries approaching the house on surveillance cameras. Clay detonates multiple explosives around the perimeter, killing the would-be attackers as he and Banning escape. Banning reveals to Clay that he has a wife and daughter. Leah and her daughter are on the verge of being kidnapped by Salient commandos when Clay saves them. Finding the bodies of Jennings' gunmen lined up against Clay's cabin, Thompson deduces that Banning may have been set up after all. Trumbull awakens from his coma and Kirby is revealed to be Jennings' secret co-conspirator. Kirby plans to retaliate for the President's ‚Äúattempted assassination‚Äù by declaring war on Russia. Thompson and another agent Ramirez (Joseph Millson) meet Jennings on an airfield, but Jennings kills both of them. Banning reaches the hospital and gives himself up, but Trumbull orders his release. Banning leads Trumbull to safety with help from Gentry and other loyal agents as Jennings destroys the hospital's ICU by increasing the oxygen & nitrogen supply to unstable levels, causing a massive explosion that levels the hospital. Banning hides Trumbull and Gentry as Jennings' men pursue them. In an extended gun battle, Salient Global kill most of Trumbull's security detail, but Banning ambushes a flanking attempt and eventually the mercenaries are forced to retreat after government reinforcements arrive. A handful of them, led by Jennings, are gathering on the rooftop to escape in a helicopter, when Banning blows up the helicopter with a grenade launcher. Only Jennings survives the explosion, leaving the two of them to fight it out. They engage in hand-to-hand combat ending with Banning fatally stabbing Jennings. The remainder of Jennings' men are either killed in the firefight or arrested by U.S. federal law enforcement officers. Banning is exonerated while Trumbull and a visibly-wounded Gentry arrest Kirby for treason, revealing that Jennings had kept detailed records of Kirby‚Äôs involvement, as an insurance policy, and uncovered by Thompson. Gentry is given the privilege of perp-walking the Vice President through the press. Clay decides to live with Banning and his family. Feeling guilty over his failure to protect Trumbull and concealing his ailments, Banning offers his resignation, but Trumbull forgives him and offers Banning the promotion to Director of the Secret Service, which he proudly accepts. In the mid-credits scene, Banning convinces his father to try therapy at the Zero Gravity Center together. There, they are placed in pools and float in water, exchanging comments until (and after) the lights go out.

In 1997, he became a docent at the University of Eastern Finland, and also gave lectures at University of Helsinki and Helsinki University for Technology on atmospheric dynamics, global change and Earth Observations. He also pursued management training at Helsinki University on Economics in 1998 and 2004 as well as public sector management in 2003. Prior to that he studied International management at Leonardo da Vinci University in Paris in 1996. After his military service and training at the Naval Academy, he became a reserve officer in 1981 and a reserve captain in 2003, following a National Defense Course. Finnish is his mother tongue. He is fluent in English, has moderate skills in German and Swedish, and basic skills in Russian and French. International positions Petteri Taalas is the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. His four-year term started 1 January 2016. He has a mandate from WMO Members to develop activities that give greater support to Weather, Climate and Water services, research and development institutions and the private sector. Investments in weather and climate early warning services offer a powerful means to adapt to climate variability and change in time scales ranging from minutes to decades. Taalas has been in charge of a historical reform of the WMO constituent bodies and their working practices. E.g. the former eight technical commissions are now merged to two to promote holistic weather-climate-water-oceans-environment observing systems and services. Better engagement of private sector and world leading scientific experts, as well as key partner organizations is a part of the reform. Also reallocation of the Secretariat resources from administration to scientific and technical expertise is under way. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has appointed Taalas as his climate principal as well as co- chair of the UN climate scientific advisory group. Taalas is active communicator of climate observations and science. He prefers modest and science based climate mitigation and adaptation efforts and understands the political sensitivity of related actions. Over his career, Taalas has been an adept of change management to enhance efficiency in the various organizations with which he worked, including research institutes, government agencies, universities and private companies. It is his ambition to do so again as WMO Secretary-General. Taalas is motivated to support the developing countries and countries in economic transition, especially through project implementation, for example, in Africa, small-island developing states in the Pacific and Caribbean and in southeast Europe. This motivation guided his career prior to his appointment as WMO Secretary-General, while serving as the Director- General of the Finnish Meteorological Institute (from 2002‚Äì2015, excluding 2005-2007) and when he was Director of Development and Regional Activities at WMO from 2005‚Äì2007. He has extensive experience in managing national and international expert organizations with demonstrated ability to enhance efficiency and implement innovation while maintaining high customer and staff satisfaction. He has a strong scientific background with an emphasis on atmospheric sciences. He has authored about 50 publications on global climate change, satellite methodologies and atmospheric chemistry. Taalas has held several positions and board memberships in both national and international organizations, serving as a member of the WMO Executive Council and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Council, and he is past Chairman of both the EUMETSAT (2010-2014) and the EUMETNET (2003-2005) Councils. He was the first Chairman of the Board of the University of Eastern Finland (2009-2015), which was formed by merging the Universities of Kuopio and Joensuu. He was also on the advisory board and on the board of directors of Fortum energy company (2010-2015), one of the leading low carbon energy providers in Northern Europe. During his term as the Director General of the Finnish Meteorological Institute external funding level doubled, customer and staff satisfactions rose to high levels and the amount of scientific publications tripled. To this date, FMI, one of the most advanced medium-sized weather and marine service organizations, continues to actively assists its sister organizations worldwide. Taalas has also served as a research professor and scientist at FMI dealing with global change, satellites, atmospheric chemistry and UV radiation. As the WMO director he was reorganizing the WMO Development co-operation to pay more attention to services for members and resource mobilizing for assisting the less developed Members and their national meteorological and hydrological services.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History Woodward Avenue likely began as a Native American trail, but the thoroughfare was firmly established in 1805-1806, when it was included in the master plan for rebuilding Detroit after the 1805 fire. By 1820, Woodward Avenue had been improved from downtown Detroit up through Six Mile Road. By 1878, Detroit suburbs had crept up to the area that is now the New Center Commercial Historic District, and in 1878-1882, a series of subdivisions were platted in the area. Development was hastened by the construction of Grand Boulevard, which began in 1883. In 1885, the city of Detroit annexed all the land within the Grand Boulevard ring, including this district. The intersection of two main streets - Woodward Avenue and Grand Boulevard - made a natural location for a commercial district. Commercial structures were being constructed in the area by 1884, and by 1889 the east and west sides of Woodward between Milwaukee and Baltimore were already filled with commercial structures. Some of these buildings are still extant in the district. By 1897 commercial development extended north to Grand Boulevard. Further development occurred in the district around 1915, corresponding to the rise of the automotive industry and the opening of Henry Ford Hospital a few blocks down Grand Boulevard. In 1922, General Motors began construction on a new headquarters building (the General Motors Building just one block west of this district, and in 1927 Fisher Body followed suit, beginning construction of the landmark Fisher Building. These two buildings anchored what the Fisher brothers envisioned as a new central business district - the New Center - that would relieve the congestion in Detroit's primary downtown business district. The late 1920s also saw more redevelopment in the commercial district along Woodward. In 1936-1937, Woodward Avenue was widened along almost its entire route, including through the New Center. In the process, all but two of the buildings on the west side of Woodward were demolished. The two remaining structures were shortened, with new facades added. New buildings were infilled in the early 1940s. However, the city's population began declining in the 1950s, and the New Center, along with much of the rest of the city, began a slow decline. General Motors, remaining in the area, stabilized the surrounding neighborhood, and the New Center Council, a local business organization created in 1967, ensured that the commercial district was able to survive. Description The district contains fourteen contributing structures, as well as one non-contributing building. All structures are one to three-story commercial masonry buildings. The buildings are constructed in a range of architectural styles, including Commercial style, Neoclassical, Art Deco and Moderne. The district is representative of many of the local commercial districts in Detroit which sprung up at the intersections of major streets. However, the New Center area has retained more commercial vitality than many other neighborhood commercial districts, and the buildings within the district maintain a higher degree of integrity. Construction dates range from the late 1880s to 1942. The fifteen buildings in the district include: Woodward and Milwaukee, looking southeast East side of Woodward, Baltimore - Milwaukee * 6400-02 Woodward/11-21 West Baltimore Street, 1914 This two-story tall white brick commercial building was constructed in 1914. It has three storefront bays wide facing Woodward and ten bays along Baltimore. The storefronts have been filled with concrete and glass block. The second floor has large window openings with small hopper widows inset into glass block filling. Atop the building is a parapet wall and original metal cornice. * 6408-16 Woodward, c. 1885 This two- story building was likely originally two separate buildings, both constructed prior to 1889. The building is four bays wide; the first floor storefronts are sided and the second floor is clad in porcelain enamel metal panels with vertical metal strips which divide front of the building into sixteen equal sections. * 6420-26 Woodward, c. 1885 This is a two-story Commercial style building three bays wide.

Simpson in his 1995 trial for the murder of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. The team included Robert Shapiro, Sara Caplan, Johnnie Cochran, Carl Douglas, Shawn Chapman, Gerald Uelmen, Robert Kardashian, Alan Dershowitz, F. Lee Bailey, Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld, Robert Blasier and William Thompson. The \\"Dream Team\\" lawyers=Robert Shapiro Robert Shapiro joined Simpson's defense team 1 week after the beginning of the trial, when Howard Weitzman withdrew from the case stating his workload was too heavy to continue as chair. As defense chair, Shapiro was called the \\"architect\\" of the Simpson defense for building the high-profile legal team that would later be dubbed the \\"Dream Team.\\" Shapiro led the defense team through much of the trial before Johnnie Cochran took over as the lead chair. Shapiro is the co-founder of RightCounsel.com and is a senior partner in the Los Angeles-based law firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro, LLP. He also co-founded LegalZoom. Johnnie Cochran Cochran joined the Simpson defense team and later took over as its chair, during the trial. In his closing arguments, Cochran famously uttered the phrase, \\"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit,\\" referencing the prosecution's scenario not making sense in general, but also alluding to the fact that the glove the prosecutors alleged Simpson wore during the murder did not fit Simpson's hand. Cochran was diagnosed with a brain tumor in December 2003 and subsequently died in his home in Los Angeles, on March 29, 2005. Robert Kardashian Robert Kardashian was a close friend of Simpson. In fact, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media while the investigations and subsequent media fallout concerning the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman unfolded. When Simpson failed to turn himself in on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter written by Simpson to the media that had assembled outside of his house. Kardashian ended up reactivating his license to practice law, which he had let lapse prior to the Simpson case, to join Simpson's defense team. Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died at the age of 59 on September 30, 2003.\\"Robert Kardashian.\\" The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/06/guardianobituaries.usa. Retrieved on October 26, 2016. F. Lee Bailey F. Lee Bailey joined the defense team before the preliminary hearing and handled many of the defense team‚Äôs press conferences. Bailey‚Äôs most notable contribution to the defense was his cross- examination of LAPD investigator Mark Fuhrman.\\"How can People be Held in Contempt After Invoking the 5th Amendment?\\". Today I Found Out. January 24, 2014. In a press conference leading up to his cross-examination of Fuhrman, Bailey said, \\"any lawyer in his right mind who would not be looking forward to cross-examining Mark Fuhrman is an idiot.\\" During the cross-examination, Bailey was able to get Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in response to key aspects of the case, including planting evidence, thereby undermining Fuhrman‚Äôs credibility as a witness. This cross-examination is believed by many to be one of the keys to Simpson‚Äôs acquittal. Alan Dershowitz Alan Dershowitz is currently the Felix Frankfurter professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and remains of the most successful lawyers and legal scholars in the country. After representing Simpson, he has represented Julian Assange, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. He has also served as a member of the legal team for President Donald Trump during the Impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Dershowitz has written multiple books about law, politics and the Israeli- Palestinian conflict including The Case for Israel and the The Case for Peace. Barry Scheck Barry Scheck, a law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City, is a forensic expert. Scheck is also known for his work as co-founder and co-director of the Innocence Project, a non-profit organization that uses DNA evidence to clear the names of wrongfully convicted inmates. Peter Neufeld Peter Neufeld joined the Simpson defense team to assist with undermining the prosecution‚Äôs DNA and forensic evidence. He is perhaps best known for discrediting the credibility of the blood trail between Nicole Brown Simpson's body and O.J. Simpson's car. Neufeld is a co-founder of the Innocence Project, along with fellow \\"Dream Team\\" member Barry Scheck. Neufeld is currently a partner at Neufeld Scheck & Brustin, LLP in New York. Gerald F. Uelmen Gerald Uelmen was part of O.J. Simpson's defense team during the O.J. Simpson murder case. Uelmen says he devised the memorable line used by Johnnie Cochran in the closing argument, \\"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\\" Uelmen is currently a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, where he served as Dean from 1986-1994. He served as defense counsel in the trials of Daniel Ellsberg and Christian Brando. In 2006, he was appointed Executive Director for the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, created by the California State Senate to examine the causes of wrongful convictions and propose reforms of the California criminal justice system. Robert Blasier Blasier was a student of Dershowitz, and was also counsel for Simpson's civil trial.https://www.blasier.com/gallery.php Carl E. Douglas Douglas was widely considered one of Johnnie Cochran's top lawyers. He later became the managing attorney of the Law Office of Johnnie Cochran, Jr. before leaving the firm in 1998, to form The Douglas Law Group (now known as Douglas / Hicks Law). Shawn Holley Shawn Holley also worked for Cochran. Verdict On October 3, 1995, at 10:00 a.m, after four hours of deliberation, the jury found Simpson not guilty on both murder counts. News of the verdict had a disruptive effect in the United States and abroad, as an estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement. Before the verdict was read, President Bill Clinton was briefed on potential security measures, in case rioting occurred following the announcement. The Supreme Court of the United States received a note documenting the verdict, which the justices passed to each other while listening to the oral arguments of the case at hand. Portrayal in film and television The Dream Team's success has been portrayed in multiple documentaries and docudramas. *In 1995, Fox premiered the TV movie The O.J.

She spent her childhood heavily involved with her local GAA club, Ballyhaise, then discovered her love of music at the age of 16. She is inspired by current music, citing Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey and Marina and the Diamonds as her main influences but combines that with her love of classic Jazz from the 1950s. Cahills's unique sound and writing style captivates the listener; her storytelling evoking emotion and vivid imagery, allowing the audience to escape into her world. Cahill independently recorded her debut EP Paper Crown throughout 2014 in JAM Studios, Kells, Co.Meath, with producer Martin Quinn. It was released that November digitally on Soundcloud only. It was later named 'Best Unsigned EP 2014' by U&I; Magazine. Following Paper Crown, Cahill released the single \\"Black Dahlia\\", inspired by Elisabeth Short and American Horror Story. The song was nominated by Hot Press Magazine for Best Track. Black Dahlia began to gain airplay on national radio, with the track being championed by Ian Dempsey on his TodayFM Breakfast Show. Dempsey later invited Cahill to do a live performance of the single. A video of the performance was posted online and racked up 70,000 views in one day. Cahill toured Ireland between September 2015 and June 2016, playing in iconic venues including Whelan's, Vicar Street, and Cork Opera House. In June 2016, Cahill made her debut at Glastonbury, playing the Bread and Roses stage, where she was spotted by the BBC and asked to play an acoustic performance live on their Glastonbury TV coverage. Reaction was overwhelming with 'Aine Cahill' trending on Twitter. Following the Glastonbury success, she played three stunning sets at Electric Picnic. In December 2016, √Åine joined fellow Irish musician's such as Kodaline, Picture This, and All Tvvins to play a sold-out 2FM XMas Ball in Dublin's 3Arena. The show raised ‚Ç¨460,000 for the ISPCC. During the show, Cahill performed with the RT√â National Concert Orchestra and was joined onstage by surprise guest Gavin James.

The group's brief career is highlighted by their role as the studio recording band for the novelty song \\"Nobody Loves the Hulk\\", released in 1969. At the time of its distribution it was publicized by Marvel Comics, and since then the tune has appeared on compilation albums, covered by other artists, and remains a peculiar artifact among Marvel enthusiasts. History The picture sleeve of the \\"Nobody Loves the Hulk\\" single. According to the record producer and songwriter of \\"Nobody Loves the Hulk\\", Rosalind Rognoff, the Traits were a popular teenage band composed of students enrolled at New Rochelle High School. The group's lineup featured Mike Carrol (lead vocals), Don Chicherchia (lead guitar), Bob Creaturo (bass guitar), Jim Klieforth (keyboards), and Bobby Williams (drums). Prior to \\"Nobody Loves the Hulk\\", the Traits appeared on the Ren Vell Records Presents: Battle of the Bands, Volume 1 compilation album in 1967, recording \\"High on a Cloud\\" for the release. In an effort to break into the music industry, Rognoff wrote songs that appealed to the Marvel Comics, which she explained in an interview: \\"I was a nerd then and still am. I‚Äôm not as nerdy as the Big Bang Theory guys are, but I was very much into comics when I was in my twenties\\". Rognoff penned the lyrics to \\"Nobody Loved the Hulk\\", a novelty song about the origin story of the Marvel hero the Hulk, as well as the B-side anti-war composition \\"Better Things\\", while the Traits arranged the instrumentals. The single was published and advertised by Marvel Comics between 1969 and 1970, and 2,000 copies were sold via mail-order. The emerald-green record was covered by a picture sleeve featuring the Hulk and the lead song's lyrics, making it a highly-collectible novelty piece among both obscure garage and comic book collectors. The Traits' later career is unknown; however, Rognoff ended her brief stint in the music industry to become a technical communicator. Retrospectively, the band's work has appeared on the compilation albums Pebbles, Volume 5, Pebbles, Volume 21, and Glimpses, Volume 4, among several other credits. \\"Nobody Loves the Hulk\\" has also been revived, noticeably being referenced in the 1992 installment of Hulk Annual #18, and covered by the Swedish garage band the Maggots in 2006 and the jazz group Tight Meat Duo the following year. The Maggots release of the song also presents cover art strikingly similar to the original 1969 version.

He was the founder and leader of the Hungarist and neo-Nazi paramilitary movement Hungarian National Front (MNA) from 1989 to 2016. He had been a leading and prominent figue in Hungarian extremist and neo-Nazi politics in the 1990s. In 1995, he proclaimed himself the sole leader of the Hungarist movement under the title Vezet≈ë (\\"Leader\\"), a term similar to Duce (Italian) for Benito Mussolini, F√ºhrer (German) for Adolf Hitler and Nemzetvezet≈ë (Hungarian) for Ferenc Sz√°lasi. He reportedly shot a police officer to death during a perquisition at his property in B≈ëny, Gy≈ër-Moson- Sopron County on 26 October 2016. Biography=Early life Despite his rapid rise by the early 1990s to become the \\"leader of the neo-Nazis in Hungary\\", as a 1995 academic work by Sabrina P. Ramet referred to Gy≈ërk√∂s, not much was publicly known about him before the transition to democracy in 1989. According to himself, he participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Following the uprising was crushed by the Soviet invasion, Gy≈ërk√∂s was arrested and imprisoned by the new pro-Soviet regime. He spent his sentence for his \\"crime against the state\\" from September 1961 to April 1963. In the jail, his political views were influenced by former Arrow Cross Party-member cellmates. Thereafter, Gy≈ërk√∂s identified himself as National Socialist and Hungarist (the fascist ideology of the war-time Arrow Cross Party). Another sources claim Gy≈ërk√∂s lived in emigration sometimes after release from prison. There is no report of his political activity after his release, but National Socialist and anti-Soviet propaganda rapidly appeared in his residence Gy≈ër since the early 1980s. According to Paul Hockenos, Gy≈ërk√∂s was an unemployed electrical engineer during the early 1990s. Hungarist leader Based in Gy≈ër, he founded the Hungarian National Socialist Action Group in 1989 (according to other sources, in January 1991), a fascist and neo-Nazi civil organization, which functioned under the cover of the Peregrine Falcon Hiker Association. The movement intended to transform itself into a mass-based political party based on the heritage of the war-time Arrow Cross Party. After the Second World War and the execution of party leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi, the Hungarist Movement went to emigration led by √Årp√°d Henney, who served as Minister besides the Leader of the Nation (Sz√°lasi's title) in the \\"Government of National Unity\\". Henney died in 1980, he was succeeded by Imre Tarj√°nyi- Tat√°r, who had good relationship with Gy≈ërk√∂s. Tarj√°nyi-Tat√°r was unable to unify the Hungarist movement which suffered from constant internal strife. Gy≈ërk√∂s' movement in Hungary under these conditions became increasingly dominant and decisive. According to historian Tibor T√≥th, the elderly and ailing Tarj√°nyi-Tat√°r proclaimed Gy≈ërk√∂s as his heir as the leader of the Hungarist movement. Gy≈ërk√∂s maintained contacts with other domestic neo-Nazi and fascist groups and skinhead organizations. He also established international relations with foreign extremist right organizations, including Austrian neo-Nazi leader Gottfried K√ºssel's Covenant of the New Front (). As a result, then Hungarian National Police Chief S√°ndor Pint√©r moved to Vienna to consult with his Austrian counterpart, indicating Gy≈ërk√∂s' threat to the national security. Gy≈ërk√∂s and his followers received inciting propaganda materials from the American-based NSDAP Development and Foreign Organization (NSDAP/AO) for his own periodical, √öj Rend (\\"New Order\\"), according to an intelligence report. Flag of the Hungarian National Front (MNA) The Hungarian National Socialist Action Group was the first organization which used the controversial and divisive flag with √Årp√°d stripes after the fall of Communism. On 18‚Äì19 January 1992, Gy≈ërk√∂s and six other members were arrested after perquisitions which found and confiscated large arsenal of Soviet-era firearms, training grenades, gas pistols and other light weaponry. Gy≈ërk√∂s was charged with inciting hatred against minorities (Jews and Romani people) and foreigners, and the illegal possession of firearms. He was sentenced to a one- year suspended imprisonment in February 1993. Gy≈ërk√∂s's arrest was part of an international cooperation between authorities to take action against far-right movements (in the same days, K√ºssel was detained in Austria). Some argue that, Gy≈ërk√∂s actively played in the organization of that event when a group of far- right young skinheads hissed and booed President √Årp√°d G√∂ncz, who delivered his annual memorial speech at Kossuth Square on the national day of 23 October 1992. The Hungarian National Socialist Action Group adopted its current name (Hungarian National Front, MNA) on 29 November 1992, after a court ruled to ban National Socialist name and symbols. The MNA declared that it does not recognise any government after the \\"removal\\" of Ferenc Sz√°lasi by the Soviet invasion in March 1945. Gy≈ërk√∂s was also trying to reach to rehabilitate Sz√°lasi and nullify his death sentence by the People's Tribunal in March 1946. \\"Why shouldn't it [the Arrow Cross movement] be accepted? Romanian society is prepared for Marshal Antonescu and the Slovaks have named a square after Tiso. [...] The Hungarist idea [...] will remain topical as long as Hungary exists\\", argued. Gy≈ërk√∂s' activity have attracted significant international attention in the early 1990s. The Nouvel Observateur wrote about Gy≈ërk√∂s in June 1993, that he is \\"a convinced neo-fascist, who most overtly emphasizes in interviews that he works for the preparation of a National Socialist state in Hungary\\". Gy≈ërk√∂s' hegemonic rule in the domestic Hungarist movement has been broken in parallel with the rise of Albert Szab√≥ who was sent to Hungary by the Australian-based Hungarist emigration group and founded the Party for World- National People's Supremacy (VNP) on 21 June 1993. Szab√≥ organized sizable uniformed marches (with armbands) which caused the media's attention directed to his movement. Through the mediation of Imre Tarj√°nyi-Tat√°r, the Hungarists transformed themselves into an official party organization with the participation of Albert Szab√≥'s Party for World-National People's Supremacy, Istv√°n Gy≈ërk√∂s' Hungarian National Front and Gy√∂rgy Ekrem-Kem√°l's Association of Those Persecuted by Communism (K√úSZ). The Hungarian Hungarist Movement (, MHM) officially formed on 20 April 1994, the birthday of Adolf Hitler. The three leading figures were elected co-chairs of the new far-right party. They announced the party foundation in a joint press conference on 27 April, under scandalous circumstances (along with Sz√°lasi quotes, portrait, Nazi salutes and Hungarist uniforms). Two days later both Szab√≥ and Gy≈ërk√∂s were arrested and imprisoned in custody for charges of incitement against the community and use of banned totalitarian symbols. They were released on 25 July and the charges were dropped by the Metropolitan Court in that year, referring to freedom of expression, and this decision was also confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1996. However the Hungarian Hungarist Movement was dissolved by the Metropolitan Court on 20 September 1994. After that Szab√≥ founded his new party, the Hungarian Welfare Alliance (MNSZ), and the loose confederation between the neo-Nazi organizations gradually broke up, even after the death of Tarj√°nyi-Tat√°r in 1995. Contemporary opinions claimed Gy≈ërk√∂s had significant role in this process, as he wanted to build a hegemonic role within the movement and declared himself the sole and incontestable leader of the Hungarist ideology. Due to the organizational work with the skinhead groups, the MNA remained the only major Hungarist organization by the second half of the 1990s (while Albert Szab√≥ abolished his party and returned to Australia). As manifestation of this status, the first Day of Honour was held on 15 February 1997, which commemorated the Hungarian and German (mostly Waffen-SS) soldiers (they called \\"heroic defenders\\"), who died fighting against the Soviet troops in the Siege of Budapest. It was followed by two other events on 14 February 1998 and 13 February 1999, and soon this commemoration became the most important event at the Hungarian far-right political sphere. These first events were also attended by foreign (German, American etc.) skinhead groups. In 1999, there were serious clashes between the neo-Nazis and the police, several policemen were injured. Marginalization and ideological turn With the emergence of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MI√âP), then the Movement for a Better Hungary (Jobbik), the far-right politics approached the mainstream sphere, while the Hungarist movement declined and marginalized. Despite the successful cooperation and international relations, Gy≈ërk√∂s decided to split with the skinhead groups. The MNA represented an \\"elitist attitude\\" and considered the skinheads as \\"incapable\\", because he thought that \\"they were not suitable for determined work to build the nation\\", as he told in an interview. The Hungarian branch of the Blood & Honour quit from the MNA in 2001, and other skinhead organizations such as the Hungaria Skins also broke the relationship with Gy≈ërk√∂s' movement. Another Hungarist organization, the Pax Hungarica Movement (PHM) was founded on 26 January 2008, which claimed itself to based on \\"real\\" Hungarist (nationalist, Christian socialist and royalist) values. The Jobbik began to organize \\"Breakout\\" memorial tours since 2010, overshadowing the MNA's \\"Day of Honour\\" events. Due to financial reasons, the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement (HVIM) and its other allies took over the organization of the annual commemoration. However the MNA continued to organize paramilitary summer camps and trainings for the youth in B≈ëny, the residence of Gy≈ërk√∂s. Meanwhile, the MNA under the leadership of the Gy≈ërk√∂s family went through ideological turn. According to a critical far- right voice, the organization claimed their admiration towards the North Korean, Russian, Chinese and other Communist-type regimes since the 2010s. Gy≈ërk√∂s also made a distinction between Communist and National Communist systems. Adopting several Communist elements, he called his new ideology with \\"Neo-Hungarist\\" term (which, he argued, responds to the challenges of the modern age), consequently isolating himself and the MNA within the far-right sphere (while PHM remained the most notable representative of \\"orthodox Hungarism\\"). The H√≠df≈ë.net was launched by Gy≈ërk√∂s' movement in 2012, which published pro-Russian news and opinions. The website became the \\"main Hungarian-language source of Russian propaganda\\", which followed the concept of Eurasianism and national communism, developed by Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian political scientist and chief ideologist of Vladimir Putin. An Index.hu article claimed the MNA had established ties to Russian diplomats, who sometimes participated in military trainings at B≈ëny too. Later the H√≠df≈ë.net was handed over directly to Russian intelligence, and the site even moved to a new Russian domain, Hidf≈ë.ru, as the Index.hu analysis assumed. In November 2012, the MNA and the Hungarian Workers' Party led by Gyula Th√ºrmer held a joint protest in √ârd during an official eviction. Th√ºrmer and Istv√°n Gy≈ërk√∂s, Jr. both gave a speech. As a result, there was a split within MNA under the leadership of G√°bor Szalma, who disagreed with the new policy stance. According to the \\"separatists\\", based in Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n County, who were in the majority and also reserved the name of the organization, Gy≈ërk√∂s \\"questioned the Hungarism's Christian basics\\" and they criticized Gy≈ërk√∂s's \\"imprudent infatuation with Russia\\". In 2013, Gy≈ërk√∂s also distanced himself from the terms \\"Hungarism\\" and \\"National Socialism\\" and adopted a new ideology, called \\"Popular Socialism\\". Several members of the leadership of MNA at that time also had a dispute over financial issues with Istv√°n, Jr., who embezzled the organization's funds, as they claimed. After the split, H√≠df≈ë.net became the official portal of the Gy≈ërk√∂s-led MNA, while J√∂v≈ënk.info remained in the hand of the Szalma-led MNA. In November 2013, Gy≈ërk√∂s organized an event called \\"Night of Purification\\" (in analogy to Kristallnacht) across the country, but with very limited participation, where bonfires were made from books written by Jewish authors (especially Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti's poems) and left-wing newspapers, which declared \\"soul poisioning\\" by the MNA. 2016 shooting On 26 October 2016, two detectives of the National Bureau of Investigation (NNI) arrived to Gy≈ërk√∂s' property in B≈ëny to investigate a complaint of illegal weapons during a house search. According to the daily Magyar Id≈ëk, the official procedure connected to the investigation of the 2016 Budapest bombing occurred on 24 September 2016. However Gy≈ërk√∂s was not cooperating and opened fire with a Kalashnikov rifle on the two police officers, while they entered the house entrance. One of them, principal detective P√©ter P√°lv√∂lgyi, aged 46, was shot in the head and died in the scene. According to Lok√°l, Gy≈ërk√∂s' wife tried to disarm her husband, but without success (later that day she suffered a heart attack). P√°lv√∂lgyi's partner returned fire and shot Gy≈ërk√∂s in the back and the bullet exited through his stomach. After that Gy≈ërk√∂s locked himself inside the house and threatened further shootings. Thereafter, the special units of Counter Terrorism Centre (TEK) arrived the crime scene, and Director-General J√°nos Hajdu negotiated with Gy≈ërk√∂s through telephone, when it became apparent that Gy≈ërk√∂s' health condition was deteriorating due to his wound, and officers were sent in the house to disarm him. Gy≈ërk√∂s was taken to hospital in Gy≈ër and was in stable condition, as none of vital organs were affected by the bullet. Several experts criticized the unprofessional procedure and the lack of cooperation between the National Bureau of Investigation (NNI) and the Counter Terrorism Centre (TEK). Despite intelligence reports, which confirmed that Gy≈ërk√∂s owned firearms and explosives illegally, the NNI had sent only two detectives, while did not inform the TEK of their authority procedure, despite the general instruction of the Ministry of the Interior in similar situations. The National Bureau of Investigation launched an internal investigation on 28 October, while Gy≈ërk√∂s was placed in pre-trial detention after surgery and transferred from Gy≈ër to the jail hospital at T√∂k√∂l. The Heti Vil√°ggazdas√°g published exclusive details on 3 November. According to the weekly's website (hvg.hu), the NNI was already aware of possession of assault rifles by Gy≈ërk√∂s, when ordered the house search. Thus it had to inform the TEK under the 295/2010. (XII. 22.) government regulation, but failed to do that. The website also reported that the injured P√°lv√∂lgyi, who did not die immediately, was inaccessible within the house for half an hour, despite the fact that dozen of police officers arrived the scene just after the shooting. On 7 November, Heti Vil√°ggazdas√°g shared further details from police sources. It claimed the searching team was consisted of four detectives and three demolition experts, not only P√°lv√∂lgyi and his colleague. According to the HVG's information, Gy≈ërk√∂s did not shoot immediately, there was a verbal dispute between the policemen and him, and Gy≈ërk√∂s even secluded his watch dog. Then the discussion escalated and Gy≈ërk√∂s opened fire in unexplained circumstances. Istv√°n Gy≈ërk√∂s' two surviving sons (Csaba, their younger brother died in 2013, and according to reports, Gy≈ërk√∂s was unable to process his death) were interviewed by blog Pesti Sr√°cok. Kolos Gy≈ërk√∂s expressed their condolences to P√°lv√∂lgyi's family, but also added that his father was already wounded when returned the fire and killed the police officer. According to him, P√°lv√∂lgyi and his partner burst into the hall and immediately fired, when Gy≈ërk√∂s' wife opened the front door upon their request. Istv√°n, Jr., who acted as deputy leader of the MNA since 29 September 2012, denied the existence of training camps and claimed the MNA \\"had abolished years ago\\". On 10 November, Istv√°n, Jr. blamed the police for the death of P√°lv√∂lgyi, which was \\"result of an unprofessional police action\\" and found the date of perquisition as \\"suspicious\\" and \\"politically motivated\\". Gy≈ërk√∂s refused to testify on 9 November. His lawyer, Gy√∂rgy L√©hner insisted that his client bought the Kalashnikov rifle ten years ago after receiving a death threat. =Political reactions and aftermath= Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n and his party Fidesz sent their condolences to the family of the victim in a statement. Orb√°n said \\"it is unacceptable that anyone should attack those who uphold order and lawfulness\\". Minister of the Interior S√°ndor Pint√©r declared P√°lv√∂lgyi, who had been serving as a police officer for 25 years, as \\"hero\\", and also posthumously promoted him to lieutenant colonel. The coalition partner Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) expressed there is \\"need to fight against such dangerous extremism with any possible methods\\". Zsolt Moln√°r, the Socialist Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security convened the committee to investigate the question of adequate action by the law enforcement and discuss indispensable steps to prevent members of \\"far-right paramilitary groups\\" from obtaining guns, while the Democratic Coalition called the crime as an \\"act of terror\\" and added, the real threat to the Hungarian security comes from the extreme right groups, and not the migrants, as the Fidesz government campaigned in the 2016 migrant quota referendum. The party also criticized the \\"incompetence\\" of Counter Terrorism Centre (TEK). The far-right Jobbik also condemned the murder and rejected suggestions which linked connection between the party and Gy≈ërk√∂s' MNA. The rival Pax Hungarica Movement (PHM) wrote that \\"a myth is broken\\", and Gy≈ërk√∂s turned to \\"real amuck\\" after years of \\"ideological amuck\\". With his crime act, Gy≈ërk√∂s caused severe damage to the Hungarist movement and ideology, they argued. Following the murder, the MNA's links with the Russian intelligence were revealed, albeit Political Capital already wrote about this close relationship in August 2014, but with limited attention in accordance with the MNA's marginalization. On 2 November, N√©pszava published a photo where Jobbik MP and foreign policy expert M√°rton Gy√∂ngy√∂si and G√°bor Szalai, a journalist of the H√≠df≈ë.ru and a former member of the MNA, breakfasted together and discussed in a caf√©. Gy√∂ngy√∂si was interviewed by Index.hu, where he denied any relationship with the MNA. According to him, the photo have been made only by secret service background. On 5 November, Fidesz-backed 888.hu published a photo, where Jobbik leader G√°bor Vona and Istv√°n Gy≈ërk√∂s, Jr. together were present on the occasion of Nowruz at the Iranian Embassy in Budapest. The website considered the photo as proof for the existing relationship between Jobbik and the Russian intelligence via the MNA. In response, Jobbik identified nine Fidesz MPs too who participated in that event to demonstrate \\"unfounded and absurd accusations by the Fidesz-backed media\\". On 7 November, the Parliamentary Committee on National Security held its private meeting, inter alia, on the subject of Gy≈ërk√∂s. After the meeting, Zsolt Moln√°r said P√°lv√∂lgyi was killed as a result of \\"professional misconduct\\". He confirmed that information which suggested the MNA sought to establish a relationship with the Russian intelligence. Moln√°r added the murder had no ideological motivation, Gy≈ërk√∂s killed the police officer in \\"impaired consciousness\\". Fidesz MP and deputy chairman of the committee Szil√°rd N√©meth urged authorities to investigate the \\"linkage between far-right paramilitary groups and the foreign [Russia] and domestic politics [Jobbik].\\" =Trial= Gy≈ërk√∂s' trial for murder, violence against an official person and keeping a firearm without permission began on 25 April 2018 in Szombathely. Gy≈ërk√∂s was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the murder of P√°lv√∂lgyi, but he admitted the illegal possession of weapons. Gy≈ërk√∂s was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the court of first instance at Szombathely on 21 June 2019. An appeal court in Gy≈ër handed a life sentence to Gy≈ërk√∂s for murdering a police officer on 11 December 2019. He was also found guilty of illegal use of a firearm.

Two perpetrators were arrested immediately, and imprisoned by Israel. They were released after 25 years as part of the renewal of peace negotiations with the Palestinian National Authority.  Incident  On October 30, 1988, two Palestinian youths from the same extended family, Mahmud Salim Suliman Abu Khraesh of Jericho and Jum'a Ibrahim Juma Adam of Ramallah, were playing a game of cards at a cafe in Jericho, when one suggested to the other, \\"Let's throw another molotov cocktail.\\"Bear, Shalom (December 28, 2013) \\"List of Terrorists to be Released, and their Victims\\", The Jewish Press The youths had been jailed previously for attempted firebombing.

Rachel was a 10th-generation Jerusalemite, and one of 18 children born to Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman, founder of Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu. They originally had been sitting together in the front of the bus, but Rachel and the children moved to the back in order not to disturb her husband's Torah study.Gradstein, Linda (November 1, 1988) \\"Israel Buries Victims Of Firebombing\\", Sun SentinelMiller, Elhanan (July 22, 2013) \\"Let the Prisoners Die in Jail, Just as My Brother Lies Dead on Mt.

It occurs in high concentrations in the urine of pregnant women as a reversibly formed metabolite of estriol. Estriol glucuronide is a prodrug of estriol, and was the major component of Progynon and Emmenin, estrogenic products manufactured from the urine of pregnant women that were introduced in the 1920s and 1930s and were the first orally active estrogens. Emmenin was succeeded by Premarin (conjugated equine estrogens), which is sourced from the urine of pregnant mares and was introduced in 1941. Premarin replaced Emmenin due to the fact that it was easier and less expensive to produce. Estrogen glucuronides can be deglucuronidated into the corresponding free estrogens by Œ≤-glucuronidase in tissues that express this enzyme, such as the mammary gland. As a result, estrogen glucuronides have estrogenic activity via conversion into estrogens. The positional isomer of estriol 16Œ±-glucuronide, estriol 3-glucuronide, also occurs as an endogenous metabolite of estriol, although to a much lower extent in comparison.http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB10335 See also * Catechol estrogen * Estradiol glucuronide * Estradiol sulfate * Estrogen conjugate * Estrone glucuronide * Estrone sulfate * Lipoidal estradiol ReferencesExternal links * Metabocard for Estradiol 17-Glucuronide - Human Metabolome Database Category:Estranes Category:Estriol esters Category:Estrogens Category:Glucuronide esters Category:Hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis Category:Hormones of the pregnant female Category:Human metabolites Category:Prodrugs Category:Sex hormones ","title":"Estriol glucuronide"},{"id":"52108518","text":"The Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883 is legislation of the State of Pennsylvania to facilitate medical education. This act allowed teachers and students to be able to dissect bodies without have to resort to buying from grave robbers or buying body parts. This act was written to prevent grave robbing, and to even out the availability of corpses.  Background  Prior to the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act being passed in 1883, many other dissection acts were passed in America. These acts included the Massachusetts Act of 1784, which stated that those that died or were executed due to dueling may be dissected. The next act was an act in New York called An Act to Prevent the Odious Practice of Digging up and Removing, for the Purpose of Dissection, Dead Bodies Interred in Cemeteries or Burial Places. This act was one of the first acts in America to prevent grave robbing for dissection, the first section says that anyone convicted of removing a dead body for the purpose of dissection, intending to dissect, dissecting or assisting with the dissection shall suffer consequences. So that learning about anatomy using dissection is not harmed when someone is convicted of murder, arson, or burglary they are then either sentenced to death, and the judges may decide that the offender's body be used for dissection or their body is buried. Then in 1831 Massachusetts passed an act saying that the bodies of the unclaimed deceased be delivered to the anatomists, under certain restrictions. In 1835 Missouri allowed executed slaves along with convicted criminal's bodies to be dissected. The 1854 Bone Bill in New York allowed the unclaimed bodies of criminals or the homeless to be sent to medical schools. In 1867 the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the county of Allegheny in Pennsylvania, passed an act, that gave each medical school, in the public and private sectors, within Philadelphia and Allegheny county Pennsylvania the same amount of unclaimed bodies per student. Therefore, a larger medical school would get more bodies than a small school of 20 students, such as if a school were to have 200 medical students they would get 50 bodies, but if a school were to have 25 medical students they would receive 12-13 bodies. If a person claimed that they wanted to be buried prior to death, then their body would not be allowed to be given to these medical schools, they would instead be buried despite being unclaimed. Another part of this act punished the anatomists if they were caught selling the spare bodies or spare body parts, the same punishment applied for the grave robbers and someone caught buying the spare bodies or spare body parts. This act later on was made into seven sections and would include all of the counties of Pennsylvania, instead of one county and a major city, and would become what we know today as the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883.  Provisions of the Act  The Act stated that all bodies used for medical advancements must be obtained in a legal manner, through the state, so as to prevent the unethical obtaining of corpses. The Act also allowed for the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research. Section One of the Act specified the creation of a board of scholars that would be tasked with the delivery of corpses. This board of scholars would be made up of no less than 25 scholars elected by each of the dentistry, surgery, and medical schools within the Pennsylvania Commonwealth. The board would be tasked with the record keeping of each corpse delivered, and who the corpse was delivered to. Specifications for the distribution of corpses were put into place by Section Three of the Act. Bodies would first be delivered to schools in need of bodies for demonstrations and lectures. Bodies remaining after the initial need was met were to be allotted based on the number of students in each class. Section Five of the bill stated that the distribution of corpses illegally over Commonwealth boundaries would be considered body trafficking. It was further specified that such trafficking would be charged as a misdemeanor offense, resulting in up to a 200 dollar fine or a one-year sentence in prison. Members of the board who do not perform their duties as required will be subject to up to a 500 dollar fine, as specified by Section Seven of the Act.  Passage of the Bill  The initial Act was accepted by the House of Representatives, but opposed in the senate by one senator who claimed that the Act was, \\"unworthy of the age in which [they] live\\". This opposition caused the Act to be rewritten and re-submitted for consideration. The act was then rewritten, and it was passed in both the House and Senate in the year 1883.  Extent and Effect  * In 1879, a version of this act was enacted into Indiana and Ohio law, stemming from a corpse that was acquired under false pretenses and used at the Ohio Medical College. This body was John Scott Harrison, a late United States Congressman and son of President William Henry Harrison. * By 1881, a survey disclosed that 15 of 38 states had \\"liberal\\" anatomy acts, nine of them had \\"illiberal\\" anatomy acts, and 14 states had none. * By 1913, there were 39 states with medical schools, like Alabama, that still lacked Anatomy acts. * January 1, 1889. In order to carry the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883 into execution, the attention of all state, county, and municipal officers charged with duties under the law were directed towards fulfilling its requirements. The coffins containing bodies should be sent to George Willie, of Philadelphia. The coffins should be delivered to the agent of the express company at the train station nearest to the location where the body is to be sent. The transportation charges were sent to the railroad station, and were to be paid by the agent of the express company, and collected from the board of scholars by the agent in Philadelphia. * Based on research from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Anatomy committee's opinion was that the law of the State of Pennsylvania was the best created for anatomy acts. It was designed in good frame to be able to provide necessary anatomical material for the promotion of Medical Science under strict execution. The act also protected the buried bodies safety.

The firm featured in series of television shows about crime and disorder on national channels and has appeared on national news, commenting on various legal affairs. History The firm was formed in 1980 by Barry Tucker, its founding partner, and from its earliest days it devoted much of its practise to criminal defence, although it has since diversified into a full-service law firm that provides legal advice to a wide range of clients across many practice areas including civil litigation and immigration. In the early 2010, the firm began to move away from pure legally aided criminal defence work towards private client, merging with other criminal practises around the country. It continued to expand throughout northern England and as far north as Manchester. By 2016 Tuckers have employed more than 200 lawyers in over 12 offices throughout London, Kent, Manchester and Birmingham. Mergers Tuckers have continually been growing in size. In December 2013 they announced merger with Robin Murray & Co solicitors based in Kent, with the benefits to both firms coming through the sharing of resources and back-office functions, to lower practice costs. In September 2013, Tuckers had gone into partnership with Mulrooney Craghill, a Sussex-based criminal practice based near Brighton and Sussex which has kept its own name and format after the merger. In October 2016 Tuckers added Kent Defence Ltd based in Margate to their operation in Kent. Television appearances In 2012 the firm featured in \\"The Briefs\\", ITV series which drew an audience of about 2.4 million viewers during the first show. The second show was up against the likes of Usain Bolt show with audience of nearly 3 million viewers. Practice areas Tuckers Solicitors' practice areas include: * Regulatory law * Litigation & Advocacy * Immigration * Health and Safety * Military Law & Courts Martial * Fraud * Civil Liberties * Human Rights * Confiscation, restraint and cash forfeiture Notable solicitors *Richard Egan, senior partner at Tuckers, represented Syed Hoque who was found guilty of using aid convoys to smuggle money to his nephew fighting with an al-Qaida-linked group while his ‚Äúfixer‚Äù Mashoud Miah, 28, from east London, was convicted on one count of helping Hoque get ¬£1,500 to Syria. Pervez Rafiq was facing allegations of using convoys to provide financial and material support to extremists in Syria along with three others. It was alleged they were using aid convoys bound for Syria to transport money and items which would be used to commit terrorist offences. Rafiq, a prominent charity fundraiser had raised over ¬£200,000,00 for charity organising humanitarian aid convoys. After a long trial at the Old Bailey Rafiq was acquitted. Two others, including Syed Hoque were convicted of involvement in funding terrorism. *Franklin Sinclair, managing partner at Tuckers, has starred in ITV television series The Briefs. He has been described by TV Choice Magazine as Britain‚Äôs leading defense lawyer at one of UK‚Äôs biggest legal practices, whose clients include the likes of Wayne Rooney. *Jim Meyer, senior partner at Tuckers, is a former president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association and is regularly asked by criminal defence representative organisations to provide advice and contribute towards policy papers regarding criminal litigation practice and procedure. He is asked to provide commentary on behalf of, and quoted by, a number of media outlets, most notably on the demise of an adequately funded public criminal defence service and the growing inequality between those who can afford to pay for their own defence and those who must rely on legal aid. Such publications include The Telegraph, The Law Society Gazette and the New Law Journal. Meyer has consistently ranked as a top criminal solicitor in the independently researched trade directories The Legal 500 and Chambers and Partners. *Phil Smith, senior partner at Tuckers, is a regular commentator for BBC on Newsnight, BBC News, Radio 4's Today Programme & World at One, Radio 5 Live Drive and Victoria Derbyshire Programme, ITN, Channel 4 News and Dispatches. He is also a commentator on Satellite broadcasting Arise TV and writes articles on legal topics for Huffington Post. Smith represented Neil Wallis, former Deputy Editor of The News of the World and Andy Coulson's confidante, recently acquitted of conspiracy to hack mobile phones after a high profile Old Bailey trial, throughout the entire four years‚Äô Metropolitan Police Operations Weeting and Pine Tree and also at the Leveson Inquiry on three occasions when he gave evidence. He also represented a former Mirror Editor throughout Operation Golding, the police investigation into phone-hacking at Mirror Newspapers, also representing him in related High Court litigation. *Richard Harrold, partner at Tuckers, in most compelling international case successfully defended a number of Albanian Nationals who have previously claimed to be \\"Kosovan‚Äù. The UK Border Agency were seeking to deprive them of their British citizenship. However, after a long drawn-out litigation, the UK Border Agency had confirmed that they will take no further action against them and agreed for them to be free to remain as citizens. According to statistics, more than 80,000 refugees settled in Britain when Nato expelled Serbian forces from the province amid accusations of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in 1999. UK Border Agency were aware, through applications for Entry Clearance, Naturalisation or British Passports, of persons who have produced details of their identity which are different to the details previously provided. It was noted that Albanian Nationals were among those who posed as Kosovan Nationals during the conflict. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has been using this information to consider depriving citizenship under section 40(3) of the British Nationality Act 1981. This would mean that subjects would be stripped of their citizenship and be requested to return their passports and Naturalisation certificates. The UK Border Agency would then investigate how they obtained their status and take the appropriate action. Tuckers were involved in successfully challenging this process by means of Judicial Review which found that deprivation of citizenship i.e. the exclusion of perceived undesirables from the UK is one of the most important trends in immigration at the moment. Between 1983 and 2009 there were apparently no recorded instances of citizenship deprivation on the basis of dishonesty but since 2009 there were 30 such decisions, and the numbers have steadily been increasing. Notable awards and rankings In 2016 Chambers and Partners named Tuckers the nation‚Äôs biggest criminal law practice, and is the only law firm to receive the national recognition for their work in defence.

Early life The youngest daughter of Lewis Miller and Mary Morison, Miller was born in St. John's, Newfoundland on November 12, 1891. She attended Bishop Spencer College, St. John's, where she won the Lord Bishop's Scripture prize and was runner up for the Jubilee Scholarship. Miller studied law in the office of her uncle, Donald Morison, who was Newfoundland's attorney general. In 1910, she petitioned the Law Society to be examined, but the Law Society refused on the grounds that membership was restricted to men. Law society At the next annual general meeting of the society, Morison put forward a motion requesting that women be allowed to join the society. His request was refused. However, as an influential member of government, he convinced cabinet to amend the Law Society Act in 1911 to give women the legal right to become members of the legal profession in Newfoundland. In 1913 Miller became a law student in her uncle's firm. In Scotland In 1915, after the start of World War I, Janet and her mother moved to Scotland, where Janet's fianc√©, Eric Ayre, was stationed with the Newfoundland Regiment. Janet and Eric were married in Edinburgh on June 19, 1915. A little more than a year later, Eric was killed at Beaumont-Hamel. In England After Eric's death, Janet, together with her mother and her mother-in-law, Janet moved to the south of England. She served with the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) of the British Red Cross in the 1st Berkshire Association and also trained as an ambulance driver.  In Newfoundland  After the war, she returned to Newfoundland, but did not return to study law. Instead, she joined her sister, Agnes Miller Ayre, to become a leading player in the suffragette movement in the early 1920s, helping to win Newfoundland women the right to vote. She helped found the Child Welfare League the Art Society and NONIA. On April 30, 1924, she married Andrew H. Murray, a St. John's businessman, and they had one daughter. Janet died at St. John's on April 5, 1946 after a short illness.

It was established to allow the government to narrow the rate gap by directly intervening in black market currency prices. The government of the Philippines organized the BCB under then Trade Secretary Roberto Ongpin, with a mandate to close the gap between the US dollar vs the Philippine Peso's official guiding rate and the black market rate. Mr Ongpin was later charged with illegally acquiring Philippine pesos through the BCB but this case was dismissed in 2016. History The BCB was established in November 1983 at the time when the country is experiencing a debt crisis following the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.. Financial institutions and banks were experiencing scarce foreign reserves at that particular period. It was organized by the Ferdinand Marcos government led by then Philippine Minister of Trade and Industry Roberto V. Ongpin with collaboration with other Filipino-Chinese businessmen. Following the People Power Revolution, the organization was made defunct on February 26, 1986. Forfeiture case Roberto V.

The prosecutors also asked the Sandiganbayan to order Ongpin for the money's return as well as charge him additional in moral damages and in exemplary damages. The other named defendants of the case were Imelda Marcos, Fabian Ver, as well as five of Ver's children. They were alleged by the government at that time to have used the BCB in buying millions of US dollars for deposit in foreign banks for their own gain. The marking of exhibits was completed in 2001 while Ongpin finished his presentation of evidence in 2007. In April 2009, Ongpin asked the Sandiganbayan to dismiss the case saying that the government has failed to prove that he used the organization for his financial gain or caused \\" grave and irreparable damage\\" to the government. He filed a motion for the closure of the forfeiture case' filed against him in December 2009. The case was dismissed in a ruling by Sandiganbayan date January 19, 2016.

The methods are stipulated as part of the Global Technical Regulation established under the United Nations‚Äô World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations, also known as WP.29. In the European Union, as in other legislative regions, precise limits for vehicle emissions are prescribed by law. However, exhaust emissions are inherently rather variable making it difficult to reliably reproduce test scores. The goal of these Test Cycles is to define, in detail, standardised driving cycles that can be performed using a finished vehicle (rather than an engine test rig) which can be used repeatedly with the expectation that consistent results will be produced. The driving cycles are intended to represent typical driving conditions. For example, a motorcycle's wheels are placed in contact with a set of rollers which can be adjusted to simulate friction losses and aerodynamic resistance. The motorcycle is then accelerated and braked in a variety of patterns to represent a particular type of real-world operation. Therefore, statistical conclusions on pollutants emitted or fuel consumed by a variety of vehicles and testers (e.g. manufacturers) can be: * compared directly to each other * used for assessments against legislative controls * retested to validate the original testing results and for manufacturers * only one test procedure is needed since it has global recognition The specific drive cycles applied to motorcycles are labelled WMTC For consumers, when a manufacturer quotes consumption, emission or other statistics referencing WMTC, they can be compared directly against other manufacturers also referencing WMTC. If a manufacturer does not reference this standard, then a consumer can only take on faith that the statistics offered are both representative and valid. Also, it seems the reliability of these (WMTC) tests might be accelerating the introduction of new technologies to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy - for the benefit of consumers.  Adoptions  These standards have emanated from within the EU under the auspices of the UNECE but their use worldwide is neither obligatory nor can they be enforced. However, in order to sell motorcycles within a regulated market, such as the European Union for example, manufacturers must meet WMTC emission standards which means effectively they must also adopt these test cycles. * after 2017: all European manufacturers are obliged to use WMTC * Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam adopted prior to 2016 * July 2014: India harmonised its testing cycle with the WMTC effective from 2016/2017 * July 2013: Japan's four domestic motorcycle manufacturers - Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki & Yamaha - began using WMTC data in their literature. * since 2006: in the USA, WMTC is accepted as an optional regime to the local FTP  Issues  * the initial standard referenced existing regulations in Europe (NEDC), Japan, and the USA. However India objected that these standards did not represent typical driving conditions in that market being significantly different for the huge population of 2 and 3-wheel vehicles in use in India. Consequently a revised standard included input from the Indian Driving Cycle (IDC) as well. Nonetheless, while the WMTC is recognised as the best attempt so far, it is only a model of real-world driving and quite a difficult one to replicate by an ordinary rider. * the WMTC standards do not include any test or reference for durability requirements (i.e. the behaviour of a motorcycle after type- approval has been granted) such as those applied in Taiwan (15,000 km), India (30,000 km) and USA (30,000 km). Studies perceived such tests to be problematic for a variety of reasons despite their growing importance. Future, possibly as early as 2017, revisions of WMTC are expected to include Durability Requirements * some manufacturers have been critical of the generalisation from the measured driving-cycle consumption to an mpg statistic i.e. the algorithm used to compute an mpg value from measurements * the system remains open to abuse as with cycle beating where on-board-computers dynamically adjusted performance when test driving cycles were detected * manufacturers are finding it increasingly difficult to produce high- performance machines which can pass emission controls due in large part to the nature of such engines * emissions control generally has virtually halted the production of 2-stroke engines in favour of 4-stroke engines across all classes of motorcycle  References  Category:Motorcycle technology Category:Automotive technologies ","title":"World Motorcycle Test Cycle"},{"id":"52108720","title":"List of accolades received by Nightcrawler"},{"id":"52108721","text":"The Yukon Women In Music (YWIM) is a non-profit society that promotes Yukon- based women musicians founded in 1998.

She earned her PhD from Harvard in 2002. In her dissertation she concluded that a venom- delivery system evolved during the Miocene era, approximately 25 million years ago. And from there three separate, more sophisticated, apparatuses developed. Her first trip to the region was in 1997. Jackson took an internship at the Smithsonian Institution and traveled to the Republic of Congo, starting her trip in Brazzaville. She worked in Northern Congo, but she had to cut her research trip short when a scrape on her leg became infected and she had to be evacuated for treatment in Cameroon. Despite the early end, she collected several amphibian and reptile species, seven of which had never been collected in Congo before. She received funding from the Smithsonian to return to the Republic of Congo in 2005 to continue her research. The trip was difficult, due to flooding in the area, but she collected 130 species, including a six- foot long water cobra that she carried in her backpack because they did not have a bag large enough for it. In 2009 she was a finalist for the Washington State Book Award in the history/biography category for her book on her work in Congo: Mean and Lowly Things: Snakes, Science, and Survival in the Congo. Around the same time she took a sabbatical to diagnosis and recover from transverse myelitis, a neurological condition caused by a virus in the spine, mostly likely picked up on one of her African expeditions. Spinal damage had her wheelchair bound for a time. Jackson discovered a new species of snake with a team in 2015. It was named 'Radford's House Snake' and is only found in the Albertine Rift area of Africa. Jackson is currently working as an Assistant Professor at Whitman College in Washington State.  Early life  Jackson was born in Toronto on 14 February 1972. She credits her first encounter with a snake at the age of 5, as the inspiration for her career. She attended Dalhousie University for a year before transferring to the University of Toronto to study herpetology. She graduated with honors in 1994.

Personal life Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, the leader of a cult combining various elements of Buddhism, Christianity, and traditional Korean Shamanism.https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/02/koreans-really-hate-their- presidents-secret-shamanistic-evangelical-advisor/ Her ex-husband is President Park's former chief of staff Chung Yoon-hoi, and their daughter is dressage athlete Chung Yoo-ra. Choi Soon-sil was born on June 23, 1956 as the 5th daughter in Choi Tae-min's family. Her mother's name is Im Sun-yi (ÏûÑÏÑ†Ïù¥). She entered Dankook University in 1975, but was reported as an auditor. She married Kim Young-ho (ÍπÄÏòÅÌò∏) in 1982 and had a son in 1983. They divorced in 1986. She married Choi Tae-min's former secretary Chung Yoon-hoi in 1995 and had a daughter named Chung Yoo-ra. Soon-sil and Yoon-hoi divorced in 2014.http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20161028500090 Choi's relationship with Park Geun-hye is estimated to trace back to 1977. At that time, the National College Student Union, which started from a new mindset to ‚Äúestablish an uptight identity, a determined patriotism and an independent value system‚Äù, was founded, and Choi was the president. On June 10, 1977, the union held an opening meeting in Hanyang University. During this event the governor of the Saemaul peace corps was sitting on Park Geun-hye's right side and President Lee Myung-bak was sitting on her left side. After the 1980s, Choi started managing real estate business and operating kindergartens. In 1983, she acquired 45-pyong (about 149 square meters) of land in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul; in September 1985, she acquired 108-pyong (about 347 square meters) of land in Sinsa-dong and built a 4-story building. A kindergarten used to be operated in this building. In July 1988, she bought a 200-pyong (about 661 square meters) space of land in Sinsa-dong under a joint-contract with someone else. Later, she bought back the joint shares and became the sole owner of the property. From 1992 to 1996, Choi established and operated Jubel GmbH jointly with Chung Yoon-hoi. In July 2003, a building (referred to as M building) with 7 floors above ground and 2 floors underground was constructed with Choi's investment. Chung Yoon-hoi's company was a tenant in this building. In February 2008, Choi sold the kindergarten building to a savings bank. In 1989, Choi translated a child-care instruction book called ‚ÄúHow To Hold Your Children‚Äôs Habit Upright ‚Äù with Kim Kwang-Ung (ÍπÄÍ¥ëÏõÖ). This book introduced Choi as the vice president of research center affiliated to the Korea Institute of Culture. In 2006, Park was attacked by a person with a razor when attending the election campaign for the Seoul mayor as the representative of Grand National Party. Choi Soon-sil looked after Park when she was hospitalized. After leaving hospital, Park continued to receive treatment at Choi Soon-sil's older sister Choi Soon-deuk's house. It is confirmed that Choi operates a cafe and an Italian restaurant ‚ÄúTesta Rossa\\" in Nonhyeon-dong (in Gangnam-gu, Seoul). The remodeled building has been running since December 2014 (with the first and second floor selling various drinks and sandwiches while the third floor is Choi's private office.) An insider gave testimony saying that Choi has been contacting and meeting with politicians, influential businessmen and business tycoons on the 2nd and 3rd floors of this building. 2016 South Korean political scandal The scandal involves allegations that she was responsible for masterminding governmental policy and decision making during Park's administration. Prosecutors have raided offices and homes linked to Choi. Park's secretaries have been ordered to resign following the scandal. She may have ordered Korean prosecutors to indict a Japanese journalist, Tatsuya Kato (Seoul Bureau chief of Sankei Shimbun), for defamation for reporting that President Park and Chung Yoon-hoi had a secret seven-hour meeting with Choi after the sinking of MV Sewol.\\"Korean Prosecutors Indict Japanese Journalist on Defamation Charge\\", The Wall Street Journal On October 31, Choi met with prosecutors, telling reporters ‚ÄúPlease, forgive me.

Murder On May 27, 2003 Jatin Patel (a man who had recently been deported from the United States after serving a 60-month jail sentence for theft) met Tom at a night club on the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver where Patel stated that he would pay Tom $400 for sex. The two then relocated to Room 214 at the Travelodge Hotel in North Vancouver. While performing oral sex on her, Patel became aware of scarring on Tom's body that he recognized to be from gender confirmation surgery and became enraged, strangling Tom to death. Patel proceeded to hide Tom's body inside of a closet while he went to find another woman to have sexual relations with. When they arrived back to the hotel, Patel told the second woman that he was considering disposing of Tom's body by throwing it in the ocean, burning it, or chopping it up. Tom's body remained in the closet for 3 days until Patel wrapped her body in a mattress cover and left it in a shopping cart behind a dry cleaning establishment nearby. Tom's body was found 4 days after her murder, on May 31, 2003. Trial and Controversy On July 26, 2005 BC Supreme Court Justice Patrick Dohm rejected the application that Tom's murder was a hate crime under the premise that Patel did not intentionally target Tom because of her gender identity, because Patel did not know that Tom identified as a transgender woman when they initially met. This resulted in anger and outrage from the many who believe that this crime was committed with a bias that resulted entirely because of Tom's gender identity and status as a sex worker. Patel's defense argued that Patel's encounter with Tom caused him to feel rage, betrayal and personal violation, which ultimately caused him to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. The defense also stated that Patel had been sexually assaulted during his sentences over the past 14 years in different U.S. jails, which explained his raging reaction to Tom. Patel's defense issued a plea bargain for his charge to be dropped from second degree murder down to manslaughter. This request was approved and Patel was sentenced to a total of 9 years in prison. However, in 2009 Patel was released from jail and relocated to a halfway house after a total of 4 years of jail time, after he was granted double-time credit for the time he previously served in jail following Tom's murder. Patel was later taken back into police custody after failing to return to the halfway house before curfew. Police suspect Patel was on the Downtown Eastside around other sex workers. Remembrance Tom's murder resulted in a great upset for the transgender community and its alliances. A candlelight vigil was held in Tom's honour in Vancouver in June 2013.

Arnold was born in Macoun, Saskatchewan, Canada. Early life Arnold obtained a teaching certificate in 1925. She was hired at a junior schoolhouse in the remote village of Amulet, Saskatchewan and worked there from January 1926 to December 1927. She later moved to Winnipeg to study business. Career=Pre-war years Upon graduation from the Success Business College, she accepted a job teaching shorthand. Arnold was hired as a secretary to the editor at the Regina Leader-Post in 1930, worked her way up through the organization and became a reporter. She was promoted to women's page editor in 1934 and started her own column called \\"It's a Secret, But‚Ä¶\\", where she wrote about her passion for suffrage, socialism and pacifism, as well as more traditional women's page topics like make-up, fashion and gossip. In her memoir, One Woman's War, Arnold wrote about her desire to move to Europe as a journalist. > As a young reporter with the Regina Leader-Post, I had gone to Europe in > 1935, intending to stay for a year or so. My reason for going can be boiled > down to two words: political curiosity. Living through the drought and > unemployment of the Depression in Saskatchewan, those of us in our twenties > passionately debated the pros and cons of socialism, communism, fascism and > democracy, searching for answers to why more than a million Canadians could > not find a job. In Saskatchewan it was difficult to examine these isms > firsthand. But in Europe surely we would find some answers. The Leader-Post did not share Arnold's priorities. Bob MacRae, Arnold's editor, informed her in a letter in 1936 that: \\"Only a fraction of our readers get het up about economics and foreign policy‚Ä¶ they are more concerned with love, food, the movies, clothes and family affairs.\\" Later that year, Arnold joined the Canadian Press as their Paris correspondent. Arnold recalled that her bosses from the Canadian Press told her: \\"The boys in the London Bureau will look after the political and military stuff.\\" Similarly, when Arnold asked the French government's Chief Press Officer for the Anglo-American Press to send her to the Maginot Line, he responded: \\"Mademoiselle, it's impossible. There's no place for a woman on these trips. We can't be responsible.\\" On top of sexism, Arnold faced barriers for being a Canadian. Only British and American reporters were welcomed to briefings at the French War Office. War years Arnold left Paris one day before the Nazis invaded. Thousands of refugees marched south alongside her. She took the opportunity to interview them. As the country‚Äôs government and infrastructure collapsed, Arnold tried to mail stories. None of them reached their destinations. In an attempt to get her stories censored, a necessary step before publication, Arnold tried to find the French government. When she reached Bordeaux, the British Embassy told Arnold in no uncertain terms to leave the country. She boarded a refugee ship and eventually found safety and mailing services in London. Once in London, Arnold relayed her experience fleeing France, calling the British and Canadian people to action: > And today, looking upon this heaven after 10 days of agony, seeing buses > circulating normally and people going about their Sunday occupations I > couldn't help thinking ‚Äì heaven, yes, but for how long? I wanted to shout to > everyone I saw here: \\"For God's sake wake up, every man and woman, and turn > England into a fortress so that what I have seen in those two weeks may > never happen here.\\" Arnold left journalism to work for the Free French Information Service in 1941. Post-war years After the war, Arnold transferred to the French Embassy in Ottawa, where she headed the information service until her retirement in 1971. She died in Regina, Saskatchewan on September 29, 2002. Awards France honoured her commitment to the country by making her an honorary brigadier in the French free forces in 1940 and giving her the Legion of Honour in 1975.

The park is situated west of the Herredsvang neighborhood along the street Fj√¶ldev√¶nget Busvej to the south and Brendstrup Forest to the west. Marienlyst Park is one of the largest parks in Aarhus and features both landscaped lawns and artificial forested hills. Facilities include an amphitheatre, soccer fields, playgrounds and a 6-hole golf course. Marienlyst Park was established in connection with the development of western Hasle in the 1970s and today forms part of a green corridor extending from Vestereng to Brabrand Lake. The park is owned by Aarhus Municipality and is managed by the municipal department Natur og Milj√∏ (Nature and Environment). Marienlyst Park can be rented for public events. The largest areas in Marienlyst Park are landscaped and managed, such as grass lawns and soccer fields, but there are some areas intentionally left to grow wilder. Artificial hills have been created from surplus soil from construction projects and are now left to grow as small managed forests. The park includes two marked running tracks of 1500 and 3000 meters. In addition Marienlyst Golf Club maintains a 6-hole short-golf course, accessible through an introductory course in the club.  Environmental policy  In 1988, Aarhus City Council enacted the plan \\"√Örhus omkranset af skove\\" (Aarhus surrounded by forests) which outlines a masterplan for green spaces in the city. The basic premise is that neighborhoods and districts should be separated by green spaces such as parks or forests. Marienlyst Park was created earlier as a neighborhood park but the result of the later municipal policy has been that the park today is part of a larger network of recreational spaces. The neighboring Brendstrup Forest is one of several new forests and natural areas established since the 1990s.

Qahat, a righteous man, was the second son of Levi, and lived to be 133 years old. He was the father of the Kohathites and was appointed to carry the ark along with sacred utensils of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the desert. The Testament of Qahat is addressed to his son Amram regarding the sacredness of the texts and laws that have been passed down from previous fathers all the way to Noah. Qahat speaks specifically about the inheritance being passed down, which is believed to be the books and laws given from God passed down generationally from Noah to Shem, Abraham to Isaac, Isaac to Jacob, Jacob to Levi and then to Qahat.

Retrieved from http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0022521/nichols_a.pdf Testaments usually end with a narrative of the speaker's death as is the case in 4Q542; The Testament of Qahat was written on Qahat's death bed as a farewell. The two small fragments appear to continue with the admonition, so the length of the actual whole scroll is uncertain. The transmission of the priestly teachings is highly significant to this manuscript and a high-priestly line plays an important role in these three fragments.  Authorship  The setting of the text is a typical example of ‚Äòdeath bed‚Äô literature similar to the testaments of the twelve patriarchs but characterized like the testaments of Levi and Amram by its priestly perspective. The farewell address is from Kohath, the son of Levi, to his sons ‚Äì presumably Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, but it specifically mentions Amram,Cf. 1 Chronicles 6 on the privileges and responsibilities of the priesthood.Stuckenbruck, L. T. (2011). Pseudepigraphy and First Person Discourse in the Dead Sea Documents: From the Aramaic Texts to Writings of the Ya·∏•ad. In The Dead Sea Scrolls and Contemporary Culture (pp. 295-326). Brill. The speaker clearly mentions ‚ÄòAmram my son‚Äô (frag 1 ii 11) and ‚ÄòLevi my father‚Äô (frag 1 ii 9) indicating that he, in fact, is Qahat. The manuscript has been dated on palaeographic grounds to 125-10 BCE and the composition of this manuscript even earlier. The first part of this manuscript stresses the transition of teachings passed down from Abraham through Issac, Levi, Qahat and finally to Amram. The manuscript addresses the inheritance received from their fathers which are intended to be passed down to future generations. The genealogy written highly stresses the importance of passing down the values and teaching of the priestly traditions, keeping the priesthood and its duties and prerogatives pure. Testament of Qahat Translated  Content  The three fragments contain the farewell exhortation of Qahat to his sons and in particular to his firstborn Amran, Moses‚Äô father, for the priestly family of Aaron to keep the eternal covenant. In the style well-known from the Testament of Enoch and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Qahat urges his sons to be just, pure and truthful. Qahat does not specify precisely the topics disclosed, at least not in the fragments that are available, however, the overall priestly tone of the inheritance of knowledge passed down from Levi to Qahat and then the knowledge would be passed down to Amram in this manuscript. The most prominent issue for Qahat appears to be the concern of the purity of the priestly line. While there are debates whether this was the question of the Gentile influence on the priestly line, or the concern relates to the fact that gentile rulers had been appointing the high priests from non-traditional lineages beginning with Onias or even intermarriage with strangers or those outside the pure priesthood line. Also the importance of keeping the lineage and priesthood pure by restrictions on priestly marriages with gentiles. The warnings directed to his children in these manuscripts were to protect their heritage from mingling (frag 1 column i ) with 'half-breeds and strangers'.Hannah Harrington, ‚ÄòIntermarriage in Qumran Texts: The Legacy of Ezra-Nehemiah‚Äô, in Christian Frevel (ed.), Mixed Marriages: Intermarriage and Group Identity in the Second Temple Period (LHB/OTS, 547; London: T & T Clark, 2011), pp. 251‚Äì79.Henryk Drawnel, ‚ÄòThe Literary Form and Didactic Content of the Admonitions (Testament) of Qahat‚Äô, in F.

These qualities are attributed to Qahat‚Äôs ancestors Abraham, Issac, Jacob and levi. The detailed instruction Isaac provides for his grandson Levi concerning the ‚Äòlaw of the priesthood‚Äô is a core component. This geology of instruction is composed of ‚Äúboth proper moral conduct and correct knowledge of cultic/sacerdotal processes, elements, vestments, and ablutions.‚Äù[Remarks on the Testament of Kohath E. (n.d.). pdf. Cincinnati, Ohio: Hebrew Union College.] Like Qahat or Levi who learned correct sacrificial processes from their grandparents, similar findings with Tobit were found as he was instructed in the finer points of bringing appropriate offerings by his grandparent. The two motifs complement one another and underscore a chain of tradition. Qahat also passes on to his sons the books of his forefathers. One line mentions the priesthood which obviously was of major concern to the descendants of Levi. Also mentions eternal blessings bestowed on Qahat‚Äôs sons. This appears to allude to the eternal priestly covenant made. priesthood and its duties and prerogatives pure. Although the text does not mention any specific historical figures that may have been around while this manuscript was being made, a possible \\"Sitz im Leben for this testament is the religious crisis ignited by the accession of Menelaus to the high-priestly office in 171 B.C.E.\\"[ Remarks on the Testament of Kohath E. (n.d.). pdf. Cincinnati, Ohio: Hebrew Union College.] If so, the testament and its congeners from Qumran, the Testament of Levi and the Vision of Amram, may have formed some of the earliest literature of the 'Asideans' (I Macc. 2:42).  Interpretation and influence  The major influence of the testament Qahat is it is another textual documentation that reveals information of the priestly lines, specifically Levi and his son Qahat, and his son Amran. This lineage is mentioned in Exodus 6:16-20. This testament wanted the children of Qahat to be blessed and asks that God makes his name known to his children along with his power and goodness (frag 1 i 1-4). The most emphasized teachings in this testament is the importance of preserving these writings through the Priesthood, as well as refraining from mingling with outsiders causing interbreeding.Penner, Ken. \\"Testament of Qahat.\\" Academia. https://www.academia.edu/13420399/Testament_of_Qahat. The significance of Testament of Qahat is its evidential support of the importance of passing down Priestly teachings through the Priesthood bloodline. It was very important that the inheritance, which are the priestly teachings be passed down from father to son. In the testament the author speaks about Amran his son and Levi, his father, proving the author to be Qahat. There is evidence to this in the book of Jubilee where Abraham writes that he is passing down the books of his forefather from Enoch and Noah, and passing them down to Isaac (Jubilee 7:38-39,10:14). It also closely resembles writings in the Aramaic Levi Document. There is no other trace of the Testament of Qahat anywhere else other than what was found at Cave 4. The parts of the document that were found stress the importance of teachings being passed down in the priestly line from Abraham and originally as found in the ALD, from Noah. In the Aramaic Levi Document when Levi is robed and anointed he is taught by Isaac he writes, \\"When he learned that I was priest of the Most High God, of the Lord of Heaven, he began to instruct and to teach me the law of priesthood\\" (5:8). This is the same idea found in the Testament of Qahat, as it is speaking about the same priestly line. Levi's lessons in the ALD are lengthy and deal with the preparation of sacrifices, detailing the preparation of the wood of the altar and the elements in the sacrifice.Stone, Michael E.

Its style blended punk rock, funk carioca, gangsta rap and grindcore. The band was formed in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2003. The band consisted of three members, Professor Aquaplay, MS Barney and MC Carv√£o. The band used satire and black humor to sing about satanism, transsexualty, antichristianity, graphic violence, illegal drugs, bukkake, coprophagia, disabilities (like autism and paraplegia), hipster culture, homoeroticism and more. Incorrectly labeled satanists, the humor created by the group created controversies and was responsible for many suits. They were prevented from singing some songs in their shows. They were popular enough to have some of their songs played on MTV Brasil and presented out of the country.  Justice and condemnation  After over ten years, Professor Aquaplay and MC Carv√£o were condemned by the justice of the state of Minas Gerais because of the offensive lyrics. They were condemned to three years and five months in prison, which was later reduced to a fine of the equivalent of four times the monthly minimum wage in Brazil and communitary services. These problems ended up in the end of the band in June 2016.  Etymology  The band's name is an acronym derived from the \\"Uni√£o Democr√°tica Ruralista\\", an entity that brings together landowners and whose stated objective is \\"the preservation of property rights and the maintenance of order and respect for the laws of the country\\". The band wanted a name that conveyed a conservative idea, opposing their 'politically incorrect' lyrics. There is another possible explanation to the band's name.

The farmhouse and surrounding property are good examples of the agrarian lifestyle common in Clay County, Missouri during this time period. The property is currently adjacent to the Woodneath Farms neighborhood, named for the farmhouse. The farmhouse is one of the oldest antebellum structures in Kansas City and remains an important surviving example of a brick, Greek Revival style farmhouse. Crouch descendants owned Woodneath until they sold it, and 33 acres surrounding the home, to Mid- Continent Public Library in 2008. In June 2013 the Mid-Continent Public Library system constructed a new state of the art Woodneath Branch around, and attached to, the historic home.http://www.mymcpl.org/locations/woodneath- library-center Mid-Continent has plans to repurpose the Woodneath home as the Woodneath Story Center, using the different rooms of the home as different story centers.http://www.mymcpl.org/story-center/woodneathplan Woodneath was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  History  This historic farmhouse in Kansas City's Northland was constructed between 1855 and 1856. The Arnold family owned the land, with Mr. Elbridge Arnold being the head of the household. In October 1855 Mr. Arnold passed suddenly, leaving his widow, Mrs. Finetta Ann Arnold, to finished the home with the help of local carpenters and slave laborers.https://www.mymcpl.org/_uploaded_resources/Woodneath_Master_Plan_- _Finala.pdf Eldridge Arnold was originally from Virginia and owned 7 slaves in 1850, but 5 at his death in 1855. As per his probate record, these slaves were named Anna, Mary Jane, Lucy, Henry, and David. There was a short period of time during the Civil War when the west second story bedroom served as a place for the Arnold's eldest daughter, Sara M. Arnold, to teach school. The Brick- Monroe School, where local classes were usually taught, was forced to close due to war-related skirmishes in the area. The Arnold family sold the property to Presley Moore after the Civil War. The Moore family owned it from approximately 1870 to 1900, during which time Presley Moore was inspired to name the farm \\"Woodneath\\" after the abundant oak, pine and sugar maples on the property. After the turn of the 20th century, the Moore family sold the farmstead to the Crouches. During the years 1937 through 1953, under the ownership of Edwin Y. Crouch, the property was recognized as the Crouch Dairy Farm. The farmhouse continued primarily as an occupied residence, with the land it was on being used for agricultural business, until the mid 1970s. In 1978 the Crouch family applied for and was granted that the home become a part of the historic register. Crouch descendants owned Woodneath until they sold it and 33 surrounding acres to the Mid-Continent Public Library in 2008.https://www.mymcpl.org/_uploaded_resources/Woodneath_Case.pdf  Library Construction  In 2011, construction of the most technologically advanced library in the region began. The state of the art library was completed in June 2013 and surrounds the original, restored farmhouse. It was funded through $13 million in public investment. As described in the Woodneath Case Woodneath Library Center at Night The future usage plans for the farmhouse and property are extensive. The home itself is to become the Woodneath Story Center. The goal is for the story center to be a place where the past, present and future merge for the purpose of storytelling. The acreage surrounding the library holds promise for historic and natural interpretation, walking trails and public green space. \\"Kansas City enjoys a vibrant storytelling community and the Story Center will bring this art, in its various traditional and modern forms, to all generations in the community and region.

Around 970, Al- Tamimi had settled in Old Cairo, Egypt, and there prospered in his medical field, writing a medical work for the vizier, Ya'qub ibn Killis (930‚Äì991), a Baghdadi Jew who came to work in Egypt under the auspices of the Fatimids.Amar, Z.

Maimonides (1138‚Äì1204), the Jewish rabbi and physician, also made use of his works, and is quoted as saying of him: \\"This man who was in Jerusalem, and whose name was al-Tamimi, composed a book, calling it 'al-Murshid,' that is to say, 'that which leads aright.' They say that he was [a man] of a great learning experience. Now although most of his words were accounts drawn from others, and occasionally he would err by bringing down the words of others, nevertheless he has generally mentioned many peculiar remedies in the nature of foods, what are seen as affecting many cures [for ailments].

Watershed feeder system The watershed for the Acueducto de Ponce water supply system consisted of about 30 square kilometers of the valley of the Rio Portugu√©s river. Rio Portugu√©s has its source near the Ponce-Jayuya and Ponce-Adjuntas roads. The watershed approaches the PR-123 road for the first time at kilometer 18 and crosses it at kilometers 19 and 24.Annual report of the Secretary of War. United States War Department. Volume III. 1915. Page 84. In 1915, in the part of the watershed nearest the aqueduct intake there were some 50 houses, five stables, two dairies, and a coffee hacienda. The population of the area was about 50 people. For this reason there was a some concern about potential contamination of the aqueduct water supply.

Intake dam The intake dam for the aqueduct was located at R√≠o Portugu√©s, about 1 kilometer north of the mouth of Rio Chiquito. It was made of a low masonry wall, or diversion weir, and had very little storage capacity. There was a small pool in front of the intake, deep enough to protect it, which was screened to keep out floating debris.Annual report of the Secretary of War. United States War Department. Volume III. 1915. Page 84. Accessed 3 May 2018. Conduit The water was carried from the intake to the reservoir in a brick conduit channel. The dimensions of the conduit channel were 0.52 meter wide by 0.55 meter deep. The conduit had a semicircular crown. The conduit ran through land covered with brush and young trees. It also ran through pasture land and old cattle yards. Further south it also passed along the side of a very steep hill and just before reaching the reservoir, it also passed through the Mameyes sector of La Cantera neighborhood. Reservoir The reservoir was of brick lined with cement. It was covered. It had a capacity for 2,000 cubic meters. The reservoir was divided into two compartments. The insular government at the time estimated that the reservoir held a one day's supply of water for the city residents which then consisted of a population of 35,000. Distribution The main water pipe into the city of Ponce made its way down Calle Atocha crossing Calle Guadalupe, Calle Victoria, Calle Vives, Calle Sol, Calle Isabel, Calle Cristina, and Calle Comercio. There was a block-by- block water distribution system in some 80 blocks, measured in an approximately even area of 9 blocks by 9 blocks. There was running water everywhere in the perimeter of Plaza Las Delicias, as well as outward from Plaza Las Delicias for at least 4 additional blocks.Timoteo Luberza.

SeaFall is a game of colonial era exploration which uses a legacy format, meaning the board and components change during each game, creating a different game each time and a story with a beginning, middle, and end. The game is played by 3‚Äì5 players, each of whom takes on the role of a province taking to the seas after a long dark age. Players explore the game board with their ships, revealing islands and other surprises. The game contains 430 entries in a Captain's Booke, a journal which is read in sections when players trigger in-game events called milestones. The story contains about 15 games' worth of content, with each game taking about two hours to play. The release of the game was originally announced in 2013, and its release was repeatedly delayed. Many called it the most anticipated board game of 2016, coming on the heels of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, an extremely popular legacy format game designed by Daviau and Matt Leacock that was released the year before. Gameplay Stickers added to the game board Set in an approximation of our world coming out of the Dark Ages, each player takes on the role of a mainland empire that is rediscovering seafaring technology and setting out to explore the world. Through the use of a team of advisors, each player discovers islands, develops trade, acquires resources and technology, and initiates conflict. SeaFall evolves from one game to the next using a legacy system developed previously by Daviau in his Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 games. The components of the game itself will change, as islands the players discover on the map will be marked with stickers, and players' actions in a game will trigger events, which cause sealed packets to be opened which contain new pieces, cards and rules to be revealed. There is a Captain's Booke which contains 430 Choose Your Own Adventure-style narrative entries, which are read when players trigger certain milestones. Over the approximately 15 games which constitutes the campaign, a story develops which has narrative arc with a beginning, middle, and end. Players have choices over how to pursue victory, with military aggression, exploration, and mercantilism all being viable strategies.

The terrain is mostly flat, and encompasses a middle section of the Kaidu River (\\"Peacock River\\"). The reserve is 200 km northwest of Korla in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. As a high-altitude marshland (at 2,000 - 2,500 meters), the reserve is an important breeding and staging ground for birds and waterfowl, and is the highest-altitude breeding ground for swans in the world. The area has been designated an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA #CN-114) by Birdlife International. Borders of Bayan Bulak Reserve (in red outline) At the center of the reserve is \\"Swan Lake\\", a connected series of wetlands, which was designated in 1980 as the \\"Bayanbulak Swan Nature Reserve\\" by the Xinjiang government, and upgraded in 1986 to a \\"National Swan Reserve\\" by the government of China. Topography The Bayanbulak Basin is an intermontane valley of the basin-and-range of the Tian Shan mountains, to the north of the Tarim Basin. The total area of grassland is , of which the reserve itself covers . The Kaidu River runs from west to east through the area, at times meandering and leaving cutoff lakes, and is fed from streams from the high ranges of the Tian Shan to the north and south. The rivers are meandering and braided over gravel beds. In 1982, the Du-Ku highway was built across the Tian Shan, greatly opening access to the area. Climate The area has a cold desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWk). There are extreme seasonal variation in temperature, and nights are cold, even in the summer. The Tian Shan are high enough to collect precipitation from the moist arctic air coming from the northwest. The middle elevations, such as at Bayanbulak, receive an average of 270 mm of precipitation per year, enough to support steppe floral communities. Average annual temperature on the grassland is . Ecoregion The Bayan Bulak Reserve is in the Tian Shan montane steppe and meadows ecoregion (WWF #1019). This region centers on the isolated Tian Sham mountains of Central Asia, and is characterized by extreme altitude differences - from glaciers at the 7,400 meter levels of the peaks to the flat deserts and steppes at 2,000 meters. Flora and Fauna The vegetation is sub-alpine and alpine meadow and steppe for the most part. The lowest sections of the basin are swamp and swamp- meadow. The greater grasslands of the Bayanbulak are one of the most productive pasturelands in China, with an estimated 1.5 million sheep causing over-grazing in areas around the reserve. In recent years, there has been aggressive growth of Pedicularis kansuensis, a type of Lousewort, that has damaged the local vegetation. The area is best known for its breeding swans. The swan population was estimated at over 20,000 in the 1980s, but by 2001 this had declined to 2,000. Over 120 species of birds have been recorded at the site. The swamp areas, most valuable to the waterfowl, have characteristic vegetation of Carex (sedges), Triglochin palustris (marsh arrowgrass), Batrachium, and Utricularia (bladderwort). Access and Tourism An admission fee is charged for tourists. Hotels and guest houses are available in Bayanbulak, and tents may be rented on the grassland. There is a cultural event for locals and tourists each year, the Nadam Fair, featuring horse racing, wrestling, and other local customs.

The series was created by Adrian Wills, Riley Adams, and Kenneth Hirsch in 2016. It features an ensemble cast that includes, among others, RJ Fetherstonhaugh, Colm Feore, Stephanie Bennett, Emmanuel Kabongo, and Conrad Pla. The series aired in Canada on CBC Television beginning July 31, 2017, to generally positive reviews. 21 Thunder was released in all other countries worldwide on March 1, 2018 as a Netflix Original Series by Netflix. It received generally positive international reception.  Background  The creators of the show‚ÄîAdrian Wills, Riley Adams, and Kenneth Hirsch‚Äîbriefly considered focusing their series on basketball or hockey, before settling on soccer. Hirsch explained this decision in an interview with the Montreal Gazette: > We realized very quickly that every Canadian can relate one way or another > to soccer.

In September 2016, CBC announced it had commissioned a one-hour drama series that would follow the star players of an under-21 soccer academy in Montreal. The series was filmed on location, in Montreal, throughout 2016.

There is a sharp edge to the female characters. Mostly it is fast, action-packed, sort-of realistic and gripping. It's fine entertainment, and it's one of those dramas about sports that succeeds.\\" After the fourth episode, Greg David of TV, eh? wrote: \\"I said off the top how pleasantly surprised I've been with 21 Thunder's first season. The writing is taut and the characters are anything but cookie-cutter; 21 Thunder has turned into my sleeper hit of the summer.\\" Johanna Schneller of the Toronto Star wrote a less enthusiastic review, in which she claimed that the series \\"has promise, but not many kicks,\\" concluding that \\"the show is freshest when it keeps its head in the game.\\" With its international launch on Netflix in March 2017, Vanity Fair included 21 Thunder in its \\"A-List: What to Watch in March\\". In her review of April 3, 2018, Rebecca Farley of Refinery29 calls 21 Thunder \\"Canada's answer to the Gossip Girl, and writes of the characters: \\"Now that they're all approaching 21, they have to either launch professional soccer careers or pivot into something more sustainable.

Life Very little is known of his early life, as Donatist writings were mostly destroyed in the following years. What we can garner of his life and beliefs is accessed through what his enemies said against him. He had been a reader or a lectorRobert McQueen Grant, Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and Triumph of Christianity in the Roman World (Westminster John Knox Press, 2004) p18. in the church at Carthage, during the time that Caecilianus, had been an archdeacon at Carthage and Mesurius was Bishop of Carthage. He seems to have also had some domestic office in the household of a Roman noblewoman Lucilla. In 311 he was chosen as Bishop of Carthage, by a council of 70 bishops in Cirta led by Secundus of Tigisis.Munier, \\"Cirta\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Early Church (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). Secundus of Tigisis was the primate of Numidia and as such was meant to be consulted prior to the appointment of Caecilianus.Shand Mark, Augustine, the Donatists and the Catholic Church This appointment was intended to depose the existing recently appointed bishop Caecilianus. Caecilianus had been the understudy of the recently deceased bishop Mensurius considered by many to be a traditor during the Diocletianic Persecution, though Mensurius denied the charges.Emilien Lamirande, La correspondence entre Secundus et Mensurius, in: ≈íuvres de Saint Augustin 32 (Biblioth√®que Augustinienne) 1965, p728. Saying instead that he had hidden Christians and church property.Timothy David Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Harvard University Press, 1981)p55. The Council, however, held that Mensurius was traditor and that sacraments administered by Caecilianus were thus invalid.Munier, \\"Cirta\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Early Church (New York City: Oxford University Press, 1992). The situation was further complicated by the fact tha Caecilianus was consecrated by Felix of Aptunga, another traditor.Katrin Kogman-Appel, Mati Meyer, Between Judaism and Christianity: Art Historical Essays in Honor of Elisheva (Elisabeth) Revel- Neher (BRILL, 2009)p59. However rather than depose Caecilianus, his appointment created a three-hundred-year-long schism in North African Christendom that would radically shape the intellectual life of Christianity.  Opponents  Virtually everything we know of Majorinus comes from his enemies,Allan Fitzgerald, John C. Cavadini Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999) p284. many of whom did not hold back on their condemnation of him: Optatus Optatus claims that a dispute broke out between Lucilla a woman of high rank and the deacon Caecilianus, who had reprimanded her for touching a relique of a saint.Optatus On The Origins Of Donatism XVI. The offence, he claimed had festered and at the accession to the bishopric of Caecilianus, Lucilla joined with the Council of BishopsEverett Ferguson, Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, Second Edition (Routledge, 8 Oct. 2013). who Optatus called Antichrists and betrayers.Optatus On The Origins Of Donatism XV. he concluded ....the Schism was brought to birth by the anger of a disgraced woman, was fed by ambition, and received its strength from avariceOptatus On The Origins Of Donatism XIX. He describes Majorinus: > \\"Majorinus, a member of the household of Lucilla----at her instigation, and > through her bribes----was consecrated Bishop by Betrayers, who in the > Numidian Council had (as we have already said) acknowledged their crimes and > granted pardon to one another. It is, therefore, clear that both the > Betrayers who consecrated, and Majorinus who was consecrated, went forth > from the Church.\\"Optatus On The Origins Of Donatism XIX Augustine and donatists. Eusebius In Church History Eusebius continues the storey of the bribes. Augustine Augustine was scathing of MajorinusSaint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.), Roland J. Teske, John E. Rotelle Letters 1-99, Part 2, Volume 1 (New City Press, 2001) p44. His elevation to bishop was a Wicked Crime of Frenzied DiscordSaint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.), Roland J. Teske, John E. Rotelle Letters 1-99, Part 2, Volume 1 (New City Press, 2001) p158. For Augustine the chief evil of Majorinus was his schism with the Church. He wrote of the Donatists in an epistle: > \\"It is better indeed that men should be brought to serve God by instruction > than by fear of punishment or by pain. But because the former means are > better, the latter must not therefore be neglected.... Many must often be > brought back to their Lord, like wicked servants, by the rod of temporal > suffering before they attain the highest grade of religious > development....Augustine, Letter 185.\\" Significance Although he was the first leader of the Donatists church, itself a significant event in the Early African Church and resulting in the formation of doctrinal authodoxy for the Catholic portion of the church, Majorinus himself seems to have been little more than a puppet for the rigorists. He had been a fairly low ranking clergy thrust into the dispute that had been raging for some time. This, a lack of theological output,Edward L. Smither, Rethinking Constantine: History, Theology and Legacy (James Clarke & Co, 25 Sep. 2014) p65. and the relivily short tenure of his leadership had reduced his actual impact on history.

It is a recent phase of migration in China.  History  The existence of these migrant workers is connected to the Hukou system of the People's Republic of China, with which the government sought to limit the ratio of urbanization of the population. The Hukou system is a system of residence and household registration, which provides citizens with permits for residency, which are required for the use of schools, hospitals and other public facilities. This system prohibits people without a permit from permanently residing in a municipality. Without a permit, none of the aforementioned public services can be utilized. With the political and economical opening of the People's Republic of China in the 1970s, the need for workers in the urban areas grew. Unschooled labourers were put to work in factories, the construction industry and in big public infrastructure projects, such as rail and roadway construction, as well as the construction of hydroelectric dams. This led to a massive influx of labourers leaving from the countryside. These couldn't officially settle near their workplace, due to the Hukou system, which led to their family staying in the countryside on their farms, while the workers leave home to work. This allows them to return to their plot of farm land once the work is finished.  Numbers and conditions  The word mingong is constructed from the Chinese words \\"min\\", which means people, or masses, and \\"gong\\", which means worker. Since these \\"masses of workers\\" are not registered, it is unknown exactly how many of these migrant workers exist. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistic of China (NBS), the number of mingong was 290.77 million in 2019. The hopes of the migrant workers are that they are able to live in modern houses and may work and live in simple, but healthy conditions, which are better than those they live in on the countryside. In reality, most mingong live in slums and don't have long term contracts. The growing number of workers must settle for exploitative wages, work without contracts and uncertain conditions. If they become unemployed, they have the choice between going back to the countryside or looking for a new job in another urban area. These workers hardly have a chance to get themselves qualified or to build a new life.  Future of the system  A reform of the Hukou system is planned, but the realization has yet to be started. Meanwhile, the businesses profit from these developments, which provides them with a flexible and mobile workforce with low wages. This fact, combined with the undervaluation of the Yuan, is at the core of the rapid development and growth of the Chinese economy.

Background  The Muscogee were a divided people. Beginning in earnest under the administration of American Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Muscogee, especially the Lower Creek, adopted agriculture and Western culture. A reaction against these changes was fanned by the arrival among the Muscogee of the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and the omens of the Great Comet of 1811 and the 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes. The traditionalists came to be known as Red Sticks. In February 1813, a band of Red Sticks returning from Detroit, where they served alongside the United Kingdom and Tecumseh's Confederacy in the Siege of Detroit, killed two families of American settlers along the Duck River near Nashville, Tennessee. Hawkins demanded that the Muscogee turn over the murderers. Instead the chiefs executed them, sparking a civil war, the Creek War, between the Red Sticks and the predominantly Lower Creek pro-American Muscogee. The Red Sticks were crushed in the decisive Battle of Horseshoe Bend of March 27, 1814 by a coalition including American, Choctaw and Cherokee forces. After the war, William McIntosh, the military leader of the Lower Creek, a half-white member of the prestigious Wind Clan, established a police force and organized a National Creek Council. The state of Georgia, which initiated the treaty talks in December 1820, had two main goals. First, it hoped for the cession of Muscogee land contiguous with Cherokee territory, in order to split the tribes and prevent a military alliance. Second, Georgian citizens had some $350,000 in outstanding claims against the Muscogee for seizure or destruction of property prior to the passage of the Nonintercourse Act of 1802. The federal government of the United States, following its incipient policy of Indian removal, had the goal of exchanging land west of the Mississippi River for Muscogee lands in Georgia.  The treaty  Muscogee cessions under the treaty Under the terms of the treaty, the Muscogee ceded their territory east of the Flint River, some 4,000,000 acres (16,187 km2) to Georgia. In exchange, the United States government agreed to pay the Muscogee some $200,000 over fourteen years, including a first installment of $50,000, and to pay Georgian citizens' claims against them. It also paid McIntosh $40,000 directly and granted him of land at Indian Springs. McIntosh built a hotel, now the Indian Springs Hotel Museum, on the land.  Aftermath  The Creek National Council swore not to cede any additional land to the United States, decreeing a sentence of death for violation of that pledge. Nevertheless, just such a cession would be made in the Second Treaty of Indian Springs.

Background  The Muscogee and the United States had signed the First Treaty of Indian Springs in 1821, under which the former ceded their territory east of the Flint River to Georgia. In exchange, the federal government of the United States paid them $200,000 in installments and assumed their debts to the Georgian people. In December 1824, the American envoys Duncan Campbell and James Meriwether tried and failed to secure a treaty that would see the Muscogee cede their territory east of the Mississippi River to the United States.  The treaty  Muscogee cessions in Georgia under the treaty The treaty that was agreed was negotiated with six chiefs of the Lower Creek, led by William McIntosh. McIntosh agreed to cede all Muscogee lands east of the Chattahoochee River, including the sacred Ocmulgee National Monument, to Georgia and Alabama, and accepted relocation west of the Mississippi River to an equivalent parcel of land along the Arkansas River. In compensation for the move to unimproved land, and to aid in obtaining supplies, the Muscogee nation would receive $200,000 paid in decreasing installments over a period of years.  Aftermath  The United States Senate ratified the treaty on March 7 by a margin of one vote. The treaty was popular with Georgians, who reelected George Troup governor in the state's first popular election in 1825. It was signed by only six chiefs; the Creek National Council denounced it, ordering the execution of McIntosh and the other Muscogee signatories, as it was a capital crime to alienate tribal land. On April 29, the Upper Creek chief Menawa took 200 warriors to attack McIntosh at his plantation (McIntosh Reserve) on the Chattahoochee River in present-day Carroll County, Georgia. They killed him and two other signatories, and set fire to the house. Both his sons-in-law, Samuel and Benjamin Hawkins, Jr. were slated for execution; Samuel was hanged but Benjamin escaped and lived for another decade.Michael D. Green, The Politics of Indian Removal: Creek Government and Society in Crisis, University of Nebraska Press, 1985, pp. 96‚Äì97. Retrieved September 14, 2011. A delegation from the Creek National Council, led by chief Opothleyahola, traveled to Washington, D.C. with a petition to the American president John Quincy Adams to have it revoked. They negotiated the 1826 Treaty of Washington, in which the Muscogee surrendered most of the lands sought by Georgia under more generous terms, retaining a small piece of land on the Georgia-Alabama border and the Ocmulgee National Monument. They were, moreover, not required to move west. Troup refused to recognize the new treaty, and ordered the Muscogee lands surveyed for a land lottery. He began forcibly evicting the Lower Creek. Adams threatened federal intervention, but backed down after Troup mobilized Georgia militia.

The episode was written by Brenna Kouf, and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"I am going off to a house and entering it like a snake... I will devour their babes and make their hearts ache.\\" Meisner (Damien Puckler) aids Adalind (Claire Coffee) in giving birth to the baby, and also restoring Adalind's powers as a Hexenbiest. Back in Portland, a creature follows a pregnant woman, Dana Tomas (Tess Paras), to her room and uses his extremely large tongue to poke into her belly button. Dana awakes and attempts to cut the creature's tongue before it flees and she falls back unconscious. Wu (Reggie Lee) and Sgt. Franco (Robert Blanche) are called to the scene to investigate, whom Wu recognizes as friends that moved to Portland from the Philippines under his recommendation, so now feels guilty. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are also called and while trying to regain consciousness, Dana whispers \\"Aswang\\". Dana's husband, Sam (Alain Uy) calls his brother in Manila to inform and question about the events. Then, he too woges into a creature similar to that which attacked his wife Dana before. Meisner calls Renard (Sasha Roiz) for help after aiding Adalind, informing him that he has a baby daughter and making sure that they will leave Austria safely. Wu begins to reminisce about an old story he heard as a boy about a mythical creature - an \\"Aswang\\" - a monster from the Philippines that stalks pregnant woman and then eats their children. Large quantities of Valerian root is inexplicably found in Dana's system, who has recovered enough to leave the hospital to go home. Sam knows that his mother could be involved in the attack and confronts her in her hotel room. Lani (Freda Foh Shen) explains that if she doesn't kill the baby, she will die, but Sam does not listen and brushes her off, angering her. She insists it's Aswang tradition that first born grandsons are always sacrificed to extend the life of elderly grandmothers, and as her son he owes her; then pleads with him that she doesn't want to die. Still, he refuses and hands her a ticket back to Manila, stating that death is a natural progression of life, she must just accept it! Nick, Hank, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) find that the Aswang use their tongue to transmit the tranquilizing effects of the valerian root and siphon off the amniotic fluid - both of which can kill a foetus; but that only those with a familiar tie to the victim can successfully insert their tongue into the belly. They consider telling Wu the truth about the Wesen world but decide that he isn‚Äôt ready to learn it. That night, Lani breaks into the house, knocks Sam unconscious and goes after Dana, pretending to be there as a caregiver. Wu, standing guard outside, is surprised to see the creature (Lani) so swiftly climbing the tree & entering the house through the window for such an old lady. When he follows, he can't quite believe what he encounters again attacking/siphoning Dana. When he attempts to intervene, he's attacked by the Aswang. Nick and Hank arrive just in time to kill Lani with a shot to the head but Wu is now thoroughly shocked after seeing the creature transform back into Lani. Wu checks himself into a psychiatric hospital after the experience.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"Still, at this point I'm not sure that Grimm really needed an episode that focuses on Sgt. Wu, especially one where one of the big reveals about his character is that his first name is Drew. Sure, he's the one character on the show who has been there since the beginning that the show hasn't gone into detail about. But he's also the character on the show who doesn't know anything about Nick's life as a Grimm. He's the outsider, a necessary foil to the rest of the group, able to stand in not as a fool, but as a barometer for how people without a familiarity with the Wesen world would look at what Nick and Hank do.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Poor Sergeant Drew Wu. Just when it looks like he's going to be in on the Wesen secret in Grimm Season 3 Episode 14, his 'gateway Wesen' was an Aswang.

It was later renamed the Forum Theatre and continued to operate until the 1970s.  History  The Lyric Theatre opened on 31 March 1911, at 749 George Street, Sydney, between Valentine Street and Ultimo Road. Built by the American entrepreneur and film director James Dixon Williams, its seating provided for 865 in the stalls, 400 in the dress circle and 650 in the gallery. With its three tiers of seats in the gallery, at the time it was regarded as the largest and tallest cinema in Sydney. In 1924 the theatre was refurbished and opened as the Lyric Wintergarden Theatre. Later, Greater Union took over operations of the cinema, equipping it for sound films, with the acoustics being improved by the addition of panels of softwood lattice to the side-walls. The original, rather plain decor was later replaced with sharply angled decorations in the Art Deco style and the proscenium was simplified. In the 1950s the Lyric screened many of the Universal Pictures horror films ‚Äì Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy and The Invisible Man. In 1946 the Tommy Burns-Vic Patrick fight was screened as a newsreel of the event and became very popular, drawing huge crowds in George Street for the six daily sessions. On 23 June 1960, the Lyric theatre reopened as the Forum Cinema, with a reduced seating capacity, opening with the film \\"Porgy and Bess\\". The cinema underwent extensive remodelling including the closure of its gallery to accommodate the screening of this and other 70mm films. The Forum Theatre was the default epic house for Samuel Bronston's film presenting films such as 55 Days At Peking. The Forum Cinema presented Earthquake in Sensurround showcasing it in 70mm on 20 December 1974. The Forum Theatre was later demolished and a mixed-use office, retail and residential building named Capitol Terrace now occupies the site.

Urban Theatre Projects works with marginalised voices across multiple platforms to re- imagine what theatre can be and who it can be for. Through assistance in artistic development and research, Utp creates essential opportunities for diverse artists to engage with diverse audiences via projects that stimulate urgent conversations and impactful outcomes.  Early History = 1979-1989  Urban Theatre Projects‚Äô (Utp) history is built on the unceded lands of the First Nations people. The organisation started as a street theatre company in 1979 by graduates of the University of New South Wales. The project was founded by Paul Brown, Alice Spizzo, Christine Sammers, and Kim Spinks. Initially, their office was located in the Village Church Centre (VCC) in the Paddington area of the Eastern Suburbs. The company mostly rehearsed outdoors in the nearby Centennial Park. In the late 1980s, the group was based in the Bondi Pavilion. In 1991, the group moved from Eastern Sydney to the Auburn area of Western Sydney, and in 1997, the group changed its name to Urban Theatre Projects. The group initially emphasized political theatre. The group was instrumental in moderating what constituted theatre practice in Australia in the 1980s.http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2762&context;=theses As a way of reaching a new constituency in its early years, a collective of young performance-makers made work on the streets, later shifting to art in working life processes, placing artists in working sites such as mining towns (Coal Town, 1984) and factories (Behind the Seams, 1988).  1990-2000  In the early 90s the company moved to Western Sydney where communities became the performers as well as an essential part of the devising process, such as Caf√© Hakawati (1991), a collaboration with Arabic-speaking communities at the time of the first Gulf War. Utp began creating site-specific intimate spectacles, intersecting community cultural development and contemporary performance practice. Under the artistic direction of Fiona Winning and John Baylis, notable works included Hip Hopera (1995), Trackwork (1997), Speed St (1999) and Asylum (2001). A succession of leading Australian artists has enabled the company to remain at the forefront of ground breaking new processes that have led to seminal theatre works, mapping the shifting dynamics of urban life and artistic development over three decades of contemporary Australia.  Current  The philosophy and artists of Urban Theatre Projects have driven an investigation of new forms, new collaborations and new contexts, consistently challenging and reinvigorating art form practice. Utp plays a vital role in Australia‚Äôs cultural landscape, producting 115+ works of national cultural significance and continuing to nurture the voices of the future. Many renowned Australian artists made their first work with Utp; Roslyn Oades, Khalid Sabsabi and Michael Mohammed Ahmad to name just a few. Utp has received numerous awards, including a Sidney Myer Award that recognises the company‚Äôs long standing contribution to theatre. Under Alicia Talbot‚Äôs Artistic Directorship (2001‚Äì2012) a new brand of work propelled the company into an exciting phase of growth, extending its profile and reputation nationally and internationally. Talbot shifted the model of community engagement to position community members as expert consultants. As such, they were invited to share opinions and observations about the world as they perceived it. This process grounded Talbot‚Äôs projects with an authencity that blurred the line between theatrical artifice and everyday life. om 2006‚Äì2012 the Company premiered 4 large-scale works as part of The Sydney Festival; Back Home (2006), The Last Highway (2008), The Fence (2010) and most recently Buried City (2012), a co- production with Sydney Festival and Belvoir Street Theatre. Since 2014, Artistic director Rosie Dennis significantly increased the company‚Äôs program, expanding to digital platforms (producing the company‚Äôs first film Bre & Back), and shifting to a curatorial model while maintaining an artist-led culture and branding work with her distinctive exuberance and sensitivity. Her works as Director include: Home Country (Sydney Festival 2017), Simple Infinity (2016), One Day for Peace (2015), My Radio Heart (2014) and Life As We Know It (2013), while her work as Curator includes BANKSTOWN:LIVE (Sydney Festival 2015), One Day for Peace (2016), Blak Box (2018), Talk Show (2018) and RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. (2018). Dr Jessica Olivieri is the current Artistic Director, bringing with her a strong connection to Western Sydney artists and communities. Jessica will continue the RIGHT HERE.

Two new programming streams that Jessica is bringing to Utp are CAUCUS, a research based development stream with academics, artists and community and ACCESS, a focus on artists who have a relationship with disability.  Members  Paul Brown, one of the group's co-founders, later went on to become a professor of earth sciences at the University of New South Wales.

It was first established in 1996 under the name Newspaper Printing House with a grant aid from the Danish International Development Assistance Agency within the framework of the project ‚ÄúFree and Independent Press in Mongolia‚Äù implemented in accordance with the agreement between the Government of Mongolia and the Government of Denmark. The Government of Denmark commemorated the Free Press Foundation to the transition to free democratic society system and free open economic market in Mongolia. Between 1996‚Äì2005, the Free Press Foundation printed up to 90% of total number of newspaper titles in Mongolia. Presently, it prints over 60% of total number of newspaper titles and over 70% of total circulation of nationally printed newspapers.  History  During a UNDP donor countries‚Äô conference held in Ulaanbaatar in October 1991, Denmark expressed interest in supporting the democratization process in Mongolia. Thus, Mongolia was included into ‚ÄúSupport Programme for countries in transition‚Äù, financed by the Government of Denmark.http://morningnews.mn/modules.php?name=News&file;=print&sid;=11013 DANIDA, the Danish International Development Agency, implemented projects in agriculture, energy, environment protection, education, press and humanitarian sectors of Mongolia. ‚ÄúFree and Independent press of Mongolia‚Äù was one of the projects supported by the Government of Denmark.

The Government of Mongolia invested financing equivalent to 925 thousand DKK.http://en.pressinst.org.mn/page/179.htm?sel=673  Status  FPF is a non- government, non-profit and non-membership organization, designed to promote social development. The status of non-profit organization was a logical continuation of the project and its objective. The project implementers have voiced their common opinion that the non-profit status is the best and open model and is the solution for being independent from financial and political interests. That's why, it needed to register the foundation as a non- government organization to maintain the status of non-profit entity. The best or optimal option was to establish a foundation. According to the Mongolian Law on NGOs, foundations are allowed to conduct economic activities and gain profits from them. Profit is gained from economic activities. However, it doesn't distribute the profit as a dividend to anybody. It re-invest in the foundation operations and give away as grant aids and donations. There are many foundations in Denmark and Europe with NGO status. The decision to establish NGO has proven to be consistent through the years, and to this day FPF have been operating as NGO adhering to its main line of foundation purpose and objectives.  Governing body  The supreme governing body of the FPF is the Managing Board. The Board shall consist of seven members including chairperson; three representatives of the Customers‚Äô Assembly; three representatives of Employees‚Äô Assembly. Each Assembly shall elect these three persons to the Board. The Chairperson of the Board shall be an independent person, widely respected in the society and without any particular interest in the Foundation's activities and newspaper publishing.

However, Felix was considered to have been a Traditor during the Diocletian Persecution and as such his enactment of this consecration was not supported by the majority of the Church. Furthermore, Felix should have consulted with Secundus of Tigisis, Primate of Numidia before doing such an act. Secundus and 70 Bishops appointed Majorinus in his place, precipitating a schism in the Early North African Christianity that lasted for three centuries.

It was established by the United States government to make private investments in the Russian economy. By 2005, it had invested $300 million in 44 Russian companies, including DeltaBank, the first bank to sell credit cards in Russia, and DeltaCredit, the first bank to sell residential mortgages in Russia. TUSRIF was replaced by the U.S. Russia Foundation (USRF) in 2008, while its financial arm, Delta Private Equity Partners, was purchased by Deutsche Bank in 2009. History The U.S. Russia Investment Fund was established by the United States federal government in 1995. It was the result of the merger of two funds established in 1993-1994: the $340-million Russian American Enterprise Fund (RAEF) and the $100-million Fund for Large Enterprises (FLEER). Most of the money came from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The fund was managed by Delta Capital Management, and its chairman and chief executive officer was Patricia Cloherty. Its main goal was to promote investments in Russia. It specialized in \\"early venture, mid venture, and growth capital investments in middle market companies\\", with a focus on the \\"media, retail, consumer goods, financial services, information technology, and telecommunication sectors\\". TUSRIF and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company owned 51% of the Imperial Porcelain Factory until 1999, when it was nationalized by the Government of Russia. In 2000, it established DeltaBank, the first bank to sell Visa credit cards in Russia. In October 2000, it became a majority shareholder of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Meanwhile, they acquired JPMorgan Chase's banking license in 2000 and established DeltaCredit, the first bank to sell residential mortgages in Russia, in 2001. The same year, it established the Delta Russian Fund, whose aim was to attract $150 million in venture capital from investors to reinvest in the Russian economy. It also invested in Runet, the Russian internet. The following year, in 2002, it invested $1 million in Egar Technology, a financial trading company, while the International Finance Corporation invested $1.5 million. In 2004, GE purchased the TUSRIF-managed DeltaBank for $150 million. By 2005, TUSRIF had invested $300 million in 44 Russian companies, including the aforementioned DeltaBank and DeltaCredit as well as two television networks. However, DeltaCredit was acquired by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale for $100 million that year. Meanwhile, TUSRIF also invested in small businesses, for example in Nizhny Novgorod. TUSRIF was replaced by the U.S. Russia Foundation (USRF) in 2008. Meanwhile, Delta Capital Management, which became Delta Private Equity Partners, was purchased by UFG Private Equity, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, in 2009. Three years later, in 2011, the disposal of $150 million from the fund was tabled by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Congress, on the recommendation from the Obama administration that half should go to the United States Department of the Treasury and half to support American values in Russia. By 2012, the Obama administration asked Congress to allocate only $50 million to support human rights non-profit organizations in Russia.

She was responsible for introducing the Charleston dance to Broadway in the 1924 revue Runnin' Wild. After her career as a dancer ended, she became a successful nightclub singer and recording artist. Biography She was born in New York City. There is some uncertainty over her year of birth. Most sources give 1907, but blues researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give 1892, based on 1900 and 1910 US census records, though the 1892 date would suggest that she died at the age of 104. Around 1919, she left school, purportedly to move to Cleveland, Ohio, but instead started working as a chorus girl. Developing expertise as a singer and tap dancer, she worked in vaudeville and toured the south in such shows as Bon Bon Buddy Jr. and Dinah. In 1924, she made her Broadway debut in Runnin' Wild, in which she introduced the Charleston dance, and became known as \\"the bronze Ann Pennington\\". Bernard L.

She sang in nightclubs in Hollywood, Honolulu, and New York City, including a seven-year residency at the Boite in Greenwich Village, and at clubs in Park Avenue.

Its goal is to promote and award the best books and films about art produced each year in the world.  History and goals  Philippe R√©gnier and Miquel Barcel√≥ - FILAF 2012 Noting the world absence of a real event only interested in the art book, and similarly in the field of art film, the Cogito Association and its president S√©bastien Planas created the international artbooks and films festival in Perpignan, whose first edition took place in June 2011 The aim of the festival is to present to the general public a selection of the best books and films on art published or produced during the past year on an international scale. Authors, editors, directors, producers and selected artists are invited to Perpignan to present their work. A week of conferences, screenings, readings, signatures, workshops for children, professional round tables, thematic evenings, allows the world of art to meet and present its most important productions. The Festival relies on a scientific professional committee, recognized in each of their disciplines, responsible for selection throughout the year. It also mobilizes an annually renewed jury which, at the end of the festival, awards the Gold FILAF, the Silver FILAF and the Special Jury Prize (categories \\"book\\" and ¬´ film ¬ª).  Scientific committee  Between 2011 and 2016, many must-have celebrities participated to the scientific committee for the selection of books and films: Xavier Canonne (Director, Museum of Photography in Charleroi), H√©l√®ne Joubert (Curator, Mus√©e du Quai Branly, Paris), Philippe R√©gnier (Editor-in-Chief, Daily Art), Guillaume Faroult (Louvre Museum), Pierre Jaubert (RMN Library, Louvre Museum), Florence Viguier (Director, Ingres Museum in Montauban), Eberhard Hinkel (Distributor, Interart, Paris), Herv√© L≈ìvenbruck (Galerie L≈ìvenbruck, Paris), Chantal Herrmann (Editor-in-Chief, Paris M√¥mes), Andr√© Delpuech (Director Museum of Man, Paris), Bernard Benoliel (Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise) or Laurence Des Cars (Director, Mus√©e de l'Orangerie in Paris).

The first edition of this show was held from the 24th to 26 June 2016 in the Dominican church in Perpignan. FILAF Artbook Fair 2016 FILAF art bookstore The FILAF Artbook Fair is a real meeting place for publishers and the general public. It offers an unprecedented panorama of contemporary editorial practices linking art and print: a book on art, a book of art, multiples, fanzines, catalogs, posters and unpublished projects. The fair is a place of experimentation and freedom. Conferences, performances, signatures, readings, debates punctuate this new meeting in the presence of artists, public collection managers, printers, collectors, publishers, graphic designers and booksellers.  Publications: filaf annual review  filaf annual is an annual magazine about artbooks and films. Richly illustrated, it develops an exploration of art through the prism of books and films. Starting from the attention paid by artists, historians, curators and the general public, the review is constructed as a representation of the mechanisms of production and the reception of these. Because in quantity as in quality, we know infinitely more works of art through our library and films than by their direct attendance. The world of art lives by the mechanism of the representation of art and by its actors and commentators. Deconstructing the ambiguous and fascinating link between art and modes of representation of art, the journal develops an approach to the history and actuality of books and films on the scholarly and in-depth art. The journal consists in a selection of articles, interviews and original portfolios. At a time when the book becomes an instrument of determining power for artists, making or undoing careers, playing a significant economic role in exhibitions, remaining an unparalleled object of knowledge, the review witnesses its deep issues. At a time when movies, television and the internet are producing video streaming and films that build the common representation of art, the magazine seeks to deconstruct the issues of the animated image dealing with art: Why? How? Who? Looking mainly at the margins of an international production sometimes formatted, it reflects the many and superb efforts that filmmakers still make to make sense to works of art. filaf annual develops well-founded choices in the face of the worldwide production of books and films on art. It relies on critics, publishers, historians, professionals in the field and partners forming a drafting committee. The review presents a rigorous and informed selection. FILAF Gallery Perpignan  The FILAF Gallery / Art Library  Continuing its effort in favor of the written word, the FILAF inaugurated in June 2014, during the fourth edition of the festival, a space both gallery and art bookstore. Open year-round, it completes the regional offer by presenting temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It invites selected artists to produce works combining literature, cinema and drawing. Through exhibitions, artist residencies and the production of associated micro- editions, the FILAF Gallery seeks to highlight the closed links that living artists have with literature and cinema. As exhibitions evolve, the exploration of a universe is constructed.

Mpofu-Walsh was president of the University of Cape Town Students' Representative Council in 2010. He holds an DPhil in International Relations from the University of Oxford. In September 2017, Mpofu-Walsh published his debut book, Democracy and Delusion: 10 Myths in South African Politics. Along with the book, he released his debut rap album, also titled Democracy and Delusion. Early life Mpofu-Walsh was born in Johannesburg, the son of a black father and a white mother. His parents were politically active in the struggle against apartheid. His father is Dali Mpofu a prominent advocate, former SABC CEO and Chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters political party. He attended Sacred Heart College and St John's College. He was part of the hip-hop group Entity, along with rapper AKA and Nhlanhla Makenna. He played for the Orlando Pirates Youth Academy between the ages of 13 and 16. Mpofu-Walsh spent a year living in the rural Eastern Cape village of Qugqwala, before undergoing ritual Xhosa initiation in 2007 . Mpofu-Walsh attended the University of Cape Town, earning an Honours degree in Politics Philosophy and Economics in 2012. He was SRC President in 2010, where his SRC was the first to successfully challenge the university's proposed fees increase, reducing it from 12% to 8% . At UCT, he co-founded InkuluFreeHeid, a youth-led civil society organisation. He earned a Weidenfeld Scholarship to pursue a master's degree in International Relations at the University of Oxford, which he earned with distinction . He is currently pursuing a doctorate in International Relations at Oxford.. Writing and public career Mpofu-Walsh released a song called ‚ÄòMr President‚Äô, criticising South African President Jacob Zuma for corruption in 2013. The song was featured in the Wall Street Journal. That year, the Mail and Guardian named him as one of the 200 top young South Africans. He has written on the subjects of racism and corruption for South African newspaper City Press. In 2014, his article called \\"SA's Three-Way Split\\" predicted that South African politics would split into three poles. Mpofu-Walsh has been a vocal supporter of free education in South Africa. He published a chapter on a possible free education model in the book Fees Must Fall: Student Revolt, Decolonisation and Governance, published by Wits University Press. Mpofu-Walsh was also part of the Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford campaign, which aimed to highlight alleged institutional racism at Oxford and called for a statue of Cecil Rhodes located on the Oxford High Street to be relocated. Mpofu-Walsh was quoted as saying: > \\"There is something deeply wrong with the way Oxford presents itself, with > the way it has biases against people and we are raising that and for the > first time we are forcing the university to confront that problem and > probably doing a better job than any generation before us.\\" The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful at Oxford, and was opposed by university academics and anti-apartheid activists including Nigel Biggar, Mary Beard and Denis Goldberg. It was supported by prominent academic Noam Chomsky. Mpofu-Walsh won the City Press-Tafelberg Award for promising non-fiction for his book Democracy and Delusion: 10 Myths in South African Politics, published in September, 2017.

In the production process, each cigarette package is marked with a unique visible code (also called ‚ÄúCodentify‚Äù), that allows authenticating the code against a central server. In November 2010, PMI licensed this technology to is three main competitors, namely British American Tobacco (BAT), Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG), and Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and the four companies together formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) which works to promote the system in order to replace governmental revenue stamps. Codentify was branded by its inventors as a ‚Äútrack & trace and product authentication technology‚Äù.  History  In July 2004, Phillip Morris International and the European Union had settled a 12 year long legal dispute dispute concerning cigarette smuggling allegations. PMI agreed to pay 1.25 Billion USD to the EU budget and its member states. In addition, PMI was legally obligated to mark its products with trackable serial codes. Agreements were subsequently signed with the other three major tobacco companies. PMI's affiliate company, Philip Morris Products S.A. created and patented the Codentify system in 2005. In late 2010, PMI licensed Codentify technology to its main competitors BAT, JTI, and ITG free of charge. The four companies, which together account for 71% of global cigarette sales (excluding China), agreed to use the PMI-developed system on all of their products to ensure ‚Äúthe adoption of a single industry standard, based on Codentify.‚Äù The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) immediately voiced concerns that ‚ÄúCodentify should never be used for tracking and tracing purposes as tracking and tracing provisions should be implemented under the strict control and management of governments.‚Äù In 2011, the four companies formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) to promote international standards and digital technologies to help governments fight smuggling, counterfeiting and tax evasion. The association was officially launched in 2013. According to the DCTA, around 12% of the global cigarette market is illicit, depriving national governments of more than US$40 billion a year in lost tax revenues and some say this is a serious underestimate. The agreements between the EU and the four major tobacco companies aim to stem the illicit trade of cigarettes, but some academics and the anti-tobacco movement as a wholly inadequate deterrent.[ The EU has since not renewed this deal after MEPs complained that it was inappropriate for governments and tobacco companies have such a deal.  Inexto  In June 2016 the DCTA announced that it transferred Codentify to Inexto, an affiliate of the French Group Impala. This was criticized by leading industry watchdogs such as the FCTC and academics such as Anna Gilmore, who is the director of the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. She said that ‚ÄúInexto could not be considered sufficiently independent from the tobacco industry\\". Martyn Day, Scottish National Party Member of Parliament, says while Codentify was sold \\"the new owner is merely a front company and that the system is still under the effective control of the tobacco firms\\". Other academics such as Luk Joossens, who is the advocacy officer of the Association of European Cancer Leagues, said the sale was ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù and that tobacco companies will now ‚Äúpretend‚Äù that Codentify is no longer part of the tobacco industry. PMI have rebutted that ‚ÄúInexto is fully independent from the tobacco industry.\\"  Technology  The Codentify system is based on a machine-created, unique, human-readable multi-digit alphanumeric code that is printed directly onto every individual product during the manufacturing process. A double key encryption system, with separate central authority level and factory level encryption keys are stored on a respective server ,allows for factory line production of a pre-defined number of Codentify codes that have been authorized by a central (e.g.: government) server. The system generated 12 digit variant of the code is described as pseudo-random, offering 3412 possible combinations. Data which is unique and attributed to each discreet item (product) is encrypted into the code such as the date and exact time of manufacture, machine count of the item, specific machine line of manufacture, brand, variant, pack size, pack type, destination market, and price. Critics of this system have argued that this approach only allows for the verification of the code itself and not of the product the code is printed on; thereby leaving the potential for copying. A European Commission Assessment Report into Tracking and Tracing notes in section 5.1.2 that in addition to the Codentify code being easily copied, it also fails to link the cigarette packets to the master cases. However, this critique omits to recognize that the system does allow for recognition of copied codes when an illegitimate copy is queried. The system logic leverages geo-positioning data and will recognize if a code has been previously queried to highlight and notify that the item is suspect. Illegitimate products are invariably developed and replicated in significant numbers from a legitimate example. Once the system logic recognizes illegitimate code, it is able to notify the system authority that this code has been compromised and is no longer valid. Due to the pseudo- random encrypted design of Codentify, illegitimate parties cannot predict codes and therefore can either default to replication of one legitimate code, which the system will logically identify from duplicate queries and provide notification, or the generation of random illegitimate codes, which the system will immediately recognize. Given the geo-positioning data at the time of query, both illegitimate approaches provide legitimate authorities important data on the suspect illegitimate supply chain. Furthermore, when the Codentify technology is coupled with aggregated data (parent-child packaging) and supply chain event tracking, the ability of the system to identify a suspect query is thereafter immediate. In essence, supply chain event tracking along the legitimate supply chain generates additional data encompassing that legitimate product‚Äôs specific provenance. Provenance that the illicit supply chain cannot replicate.  Criticism  Codentify has been the subject of harsh criticism as a tobacco industry promoted system which is aimed at undermining public health efforts and not capable of curbing the illicit trade of cigarettes. This criticism has come from some academics and pro-health groups, to include the WHO. The WHO FCTC Protocol on the Elimination of the Illicit Trade in Tobacco products states in article 8, section 12 that tobacco tracking and regulation ‚Äúshall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry‚Äù. Today, the Codentify technology is under a totally independent ownership and management, having no capitalistic or governance link to the tobacco industry, with application of a successor product that is now present across multiple industries outside of tobacco, to include beer, fine spirits, luxury goods, automotive parts, and pharmaceuticals. Critics of the tobacco industry say Codentify is simply not good enough, ‚Äúbecause it focuses too much on production and does not store product codes or track them.‚Äù However, the Codentify system does not require the storage of codes in the clear for security purposes (though it is capable to perform this task, if specified by the central authority), as such mass storage of legitimate codes exposes them to potential compromise. The Codentify technology uses decryption processes to deliver authentication and validation of an item and is able to provide the item‚Äôs descriptive and unique attributes in parallel, with a near instant response time. Heavy criticism has also been launched at the factory-level keys the system uses to provide unique verification codes for the product. Since these secret keys are stored on company and government servers, abuse of privileges on this level would allow criminals to generate additional codes, which would appear to be genuine to the system. However, this criticism does not take into account that the central server keys are not shared with the manufacturer nor does it account for the dynamic and static key multi-level encryption method designed into the system, which jointly provide the legitimate authority with complete and secure control over the code authorization process. The decentralized nature of the system the realities of imperfect connectivity across complex, cross border supply chains by ensuring a central control and oversight of secure code generation within production environments whilst providing legitimate manufacturing assets continuity of production under parameters dictated by the central authority. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) described the system as a black box created by the tobacco industry that uses unsecured equipment that is vulnerable to code recycling. However, this criticism does not take into account that: (i) codes can only be legitimized by the central authority server, (ii) the algorithm and both static and dynamic keys remain secret to and under strict control of the central authority, (iii) the method applied in the generation of the codes is patented and therefore visible by the public. Under this strict control regime, illegitimate creation of codes is not possible. Illicit techniques such as ‚Äúcode recycling‚Äù, using codes of products rejected in quality control, ‚Äúcode cloning‚Äù, printing the same code on multiple products, and ‚Äúcode migration‚Äù, reprinting codes used in one country elsewhere, allowing to reuse genuine codes multiple times, are therefore rendered obsolete and defeated by this multi-layer encryption method. Philip Morris has been accused, via its South American subsidiary Massalin Particulares, of using bribery and extortion to implement Codentify and Inexto in Argentina. ‚ÄúThe directors, managers and legal representatives of PMI and its Argentine subsidiary Massalin Particulares S.R.L. (MP) are being investigated within the framework of a criminal case in federal court‚Ä¶,‚Äù Attorney Alejandro S√°nchez Kalbermatten wrote in a 2017 letter to the Security and Exchange Commission in the United States. A decision by the Federal Court of Argentina overseeing the case concluded that the plaintiff, Attorney Alejandro S√°nchez Kalbermatten, had no standing and that the accusations made in the complaint were not substantiated by material facts. As a consequence, the case No.17.766/2016 was fully dismissed on September 28, 2017.
