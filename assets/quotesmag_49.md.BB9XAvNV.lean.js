He worked with Hans Liepmann and Paco Lagerstrom, the latter his advisor, submitting a dissertation on transonic flow in 1949. Lagerstrom and Cole continued their work, having formed a small research group at GALCIT to better understand the mathematics of fluid flow. These two, along with Leon Trilling found that flows having weak shocks could be described by Burgers' equation, for which Cole later found a clever transformation to solve it. Cole continued to delve deeper into this topic for the next decade.

The first two games in the series were developed by Ion Storm, and subsequent entries were developed by Eidos Montr√©al, following Ion Storm's closure. The series, set during the 21st century, focuses on the conflict between secretive factions who wish to control the world by proxy, and the effects of transhumanistic attitudes and technologies in a dystopian future setting featuring references to real-world conspiracy theories. The series consists of six games: Deus Ex (2000), Deus Ex: Invisible War (2003), Deus Ex: Human Revolution (2011), Deus Ex: The Fall (2013), Deus Ex Go (2016) and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (2016). The series has received critical acclaim and sold over 5 million units worldwide. Series overview Note: given the freedom of choice found within each game, the section below only gives the general outline of the world and the individual plotlines. While each game has a distinct story, they are all set within the same world: an Earth of the future which has evolved into a dystopian cyberpunk society. In this setting, several organizations compete for overall control of the world. Several of the societies mentioned or shown are inspired by real-world and invented secret societies and conspiracy theories. The one constant through the series is the Illuminati, although FEMA, Majestic 12, and the Knights Templar are also featured. The main characters in the series possess artificially acquired superhuman abilities, referred to as \\"Augmentation\\". Deus Ex takes place during 2052, while the world is facing a crisis caused by a mysterious nano-virus called the Gray Death. In the midst of the crisis, JC Denton, a nano-augmented rookie agent for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO), is sent to eliminate terrorist cells, but ends up drawn into the various schemes of rival factions and secret societies, who are responsible for the epidemic.

I do not wish to wait for Bob Page. With human understanding and network access, we can administrate the world, yes, yes. / JC: Rule the world...? Why? Who gave you the directive? There must be a human being behind your ambition. / Helios: I should regulate human affairs precisely because I lack all ambition, whereas human beings are prey to it. Their history is a succession of inane squabbles, each one coming closer to total destruction. Invisible War takes place twenty years later, after a massive economic depression and period of war called the CollapseLoad screen message: JC Denton's destruction of Area 51 plunged the world into a period of depression and war known as the Collapse. Deus Ex: Invisible War. Ion Storm, 2003 that was indicated by Denton's actions and a combination of possible events from the first game. The game's protagonist, Alex D, a clone of Denton, is drawn into a conflict between two seemingly opposing factions, and learns of conspiratorial factions which seek to drastically change the world, including JC Denton: Alex can perform missions for any of them, and eventually becomes able to choose which organization should rule the world. Human Revolution is set in 2027, twenty-five years before the first title, where corporations have extended their influence past the reach of global governments and the development of bio-mechanical augmentation by a few elite and powerful companies threatens to destabilize society. The game follows Adam Jensen, the security chief for bio-tech company Sarif Industries. After a devastating attack on Sarif's headquarters which leaves him near-death, Adam is forced to undergo radical augmentation surgery, and he becomes embroiled both in the search for the attackers and the political and ethical repercussions of augmentation technology. The Fall is a parallel story, set after the spin-off novel Icarus Effect. It follows the story of Ben Saxon, an augmented former British SAS mercenary, who is on the run from his former employers, a group of augmented mercenaries that play a crucial part in the plot of Human Revolution. Mankind Divided is set in 2029, 2 years after the events of Human Revolution in a world dealing with the consequences of the previous game's events. Regardless of the choice made by Adam at the end of Human Revolution, the Illuminati have twisted his message and augmented individuals are persecuted and feared. A disillusioned Adam works with an international taskforce (hinted to be a precursor to UNATCO in Deus Ex) designed to stop the rising wave of terrorism brought on by the disenfranchised and desperate augmented while working to uncover the perpetrators of the events that led to the current state of the world. Gameplay A unifying element across the series is the combination of gameplay styles from several different genres, including action role-playing, first-person shooter and stealth. Role-playing elements are mostly linked to augmenting the character in a specific way, spending skill points to create characters that can be focused either on stealth or combat, or a balance of the two. Player choice is a key feature of the series, with the actions of the player character affecting both the world around them and the way non-player characters (NPCs) react to the character: depending on which faction they belong to, NPCs might praise and be helpful, chastise, ignore, or even attack them. This emphasis on player choice is most evident in Invisible War, where players can choose the gender and skin color of the main character before starting, and have the option of running quests for and allying with four possible factions within the game. Development history The original Deus Ex was conceived by Warren Spector in 1994 under the working title Troubleshooter. The main drive behind Deus Ex was Spector's growing dislike for straight fantasy or science fiction video games, and the want to create something new and different. In an interview, he stated that he wanted to emulate the immersive playing styles of games like Ultima Underworld, and eventually, after being rejected by Origin Systems, the company he was working with at the time, and Looking Glass Studios, Spector's project was picked up by Ion Storm, who, according to Spector, asked him to \\"make the game of [his] dreams\\". The title Deus Ex was meant to both represent aspects of the plot in the game and to poke fun at the design techniques that were prevalent in the majority of games at the time. The game's influences included Suikoden, Half- Life and GoldenEye 007. The second game in the series, Invisible War, was unveiled at E3 2002. The designers chose to allow the players to choose which sex their player character would be, an idea conceived for the original game. After the release of Invisible War, both Harvey Smith, the main designer for Deus Ex, and Spector left Ion Storm in 2004, with the former citing health problems and the latter saying he wished to pursue his own projects. Later, because of restructuring at Eidos Interactive, Ion Storm was closed down the following year. A multiplayer-focused third game titled Deus Ex: Clan Wars was originally being made at Crystal Dynamics, but because of the commercial underperformance of Invisible War, it was distanced from the Deux Ex series and renamed Project Snowblind. Human Revolution was announced in 2007 under the working title Deus Ex 3. The game's creation was handled by Eidos Montr√©al and the developer's parent company Square Enix, whose Visual Works department created the CG movies for the game. The game became the first entry in the series to receive downloadable content in the form of The Missing Link, an extra episode designed to fill a narrative gap in the game.Eidos Montreal confirms downloadable content plans for Deus Ex: Human Revolution Johnny Cullen, VG247.com. Last accessed August 18, 2010. In 2013, a new title was created for iPhone and iPad. Titled The Fall and set within Human Revolutions timeframe, the game was created by the previous game's core team and a team from mobile phone developer N-Fusion. In October 2013, Eidos Montr√©al announced that they were working on another title in the series for PC and next-gen platforms, and that it would be the first part of a larger, transmedia project called Deus Ex: Universe. Related media CBS Films has acquired screen rights to Deus Ex, after Eidos was purchased by Square Enix. An announcement was made for a film adaptation of Deus Ex: Human Revolution in July 2012. In 2015, Adrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman films, stated that he hoped to oversee a shared universe of Square Enix films with Just Cause, Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, and Thief, but admitted that he does not have the rights to Tomb Raider. In May 2017, the Game Central reporters at Metro UK suggested that the shared universe was unlikely, pointing out that no progress had been made on any Just Cause, Deus Ex nor Thief films. Human Revolution inspired a tie-in comic book, a spin-off novel, and action figures. Alongside the announcement of a next-gen entry in the franchise, Eidos Montr√©al announced Deus Ex: Universe, a multimedial project involving video games across all platforms, books, graphic novels and other unspecified mediums. Deus Ex Go is a mobile game for iOS and Android systems developed by Square Enix Montreal, released in 2016. It is a puzzle-based game in the same fashion as Square Enix Montreal's previous mobile titles, Hitman Go and Lara Croft Go. Reception Overall, the Deus Ex series has been generally well received by fans and critics, with the games' storylines and freedom of choice being the main point of praise. The first game won multiple awards from various video game publications, and was lauded by critics at the time, although its graphics came in for some criticism. Invisible War was also well received, but did not enjoy the success of its predecessor, with many elements of its gameplay and story being targets for criticism, but many praising its branching gameplay and the high level of paths the player could take through the story. Human Revolution received high critical praise akin to that of the first game, with many reviewers praising the open-ended nature of the game and the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events. The Fall was slightly more mixed, with praise going to the game's attempt to bring the Deus Ex universe to a portable platform, but many other aspects coming in for both praise and criticism. The PC version was criticized for being a bad mobile-to- computer port.

A granite tombstone with a rosencrucian inscription in Latin: Ex Deo nascimur, In Christo morimur, Per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus (\\"From God we are born, In Christ we die, In the Holy Spirit we are reborn\\"). Photo taken on April 10th, 2020 Alf Larsen (22 July 1885 - 12 December 1967) was a Norwegian poet, essayist and magazine editor. Biography Larsen was born at Tj√∏me in Vestfold, Norway. he was the eldest of seven children born to Alfred Larsen (1859-1905) and Kristine Iversen (1857-1936). His father was a skipper who died in the North Sea in 1905. Larsen was the benefactor of a wealthy man from Sandefjord who paid his schooling, first at Skiringssal (1902-1903), later at Grundtvigs folk school in Lyngby, Denmark. From January 1908 to 1909, he continued his studies at Sankt Andreas, a Jesuit school at Charlottenlund in Copenhagen. He made his literary debut in 1912 with the poetry collection Vinterlandet. In 1921, he bought R√∏d G√•rd in Tj√∏me. He supported Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, and edited the magazine Janus from 1933 to 1941. He co-founded the publishing house Dreyers Forlag in 1942. He was awarded the Gyldendal's Endowment in 1959. Larsen himself considered his magazine Janus to be his most valuable contribution to Norwegian cultural life. There he presented what in hindsight stands out as a surprisingly clear-sighted criticism of Nazi Germany. He also drew attention to the pre-nazistoid tendencies in the work of Norway's great writer, Knut Hamsun. Further he radically criticized other totalitarian ideologies of the time including Stalinism and Fascism, underscoring that they undermined the individuality and responsibility of man, as man is primarily to be understood as a spiritual being. And though Larsen considered himself a Christian, he strongly rejected the then widespread message of the Oxford Group, most notably represented by the evangelist Frank Buchman, claiming that they represented a materialistic mentality. In Janus Larsen also presented the work of many international writers to the Norwegian public, both in the form of reviews and first-time translations. Further, Janus was Larsen's main channel for advocating the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, both with regards to education and art, and as a general philosophy of life. This movement has later continued in the cultural magazines Spektrum, Horisont and Arken, and by such prolific writers as Andr√© Bjerke, Jens Bj√∏rneboe and Kaj Skagen. Personal life In 1922, Larsen married Astrid Blicher-Hansen (1873‚Äì1954). Alf Larsen died during 1967 and was buried in the churchyard at Tj√∏me Church. In the center of Tj√∏me is the Alf-Larsen monument by sculptor Finn Henrik Bodvin (1928 2002). It was unveiled on 21 July 1985 on the occasion of his 100th birthday.  Subsequent evaluations In 2009 Larsen was declared to be an anti-Semite by historian Jan Erik Ebbestad Hansen, who in archives found a pamphlet named J√∏deproblemet (The Jew Problem). Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl referred to Larsen as \\"the worst Jew-hater of Norwegian twentieth-century literature\\". However, Larsen's post-war openly expressed antipathy towards the Jews may not represent the complete truth on this sensitive matter, as one of his favourite authors is known to have been the Jewish born catholic philosopher Max Picard. Larsen had also several times rejected the racial theories of the Nazis in Janus. (see JANUS - et tidsskrift og en tid, by Terje Gerotti Simonsen). It seems, that Larsen's views after World War II for some reason - some say because the absence of his late wife's mellowing influence - happened to become increasingly cliche-filled and eventually right out anti- semitic.

Unlike Titus' other books the story does not feature an anthropomorphic mouse. However, it features heavy use of the \\"sh\\" sound. Plot summary Sylvester Shaw is a shoemaker by trade who (along with his cat, appropriately named \\"Shoo-Shoo\\") operates his own business in a port city. Besides shoemaking, his main passion is ship watching - every Wednesday he closes his shop at noon to watch the ships (especially his favorite, the S. S. Sheba) sail out of port. Shaw dreams of taking an ocean voyage but does not make enough money in his business to do so. One Wednesday Shaw receives word that the building in which his store is located will be torn down by the city as being a fire hazard, and he must relocate in 30 days. Franklin Flair, owner of a much larger operation (the Fair-and-Square Shoeshop) offers Shaw the opportunity to come work for him, but Shaw declines, wanting to maintain his own business; Flair agrees to hold the offer open should Shaw reconsider. While ship watching, Sailor O'Shea from the Sheba meets Shaw and, upon learning he is a shoemaker, offers Shaw the chance to repair the shoes of Captain Shipley, the Sheba's captain. When he returns the shoes, Shaw is given a tour of the Sheba and is invited to the ship's party, both then and every time the Sheba is in port. As the month progresses Shaw is unable to find a suitable building in which to relocate his business; thus, he reluctantly agrees to accept Flair's offer of employment. Flair offers him a window area (with a view of the harbor) and agrees to allow him to hang up his sign as a reminder of his old business. As the Sheba is in port that day, he visits Captain Shipley to notify him of his new address, and is informed of a ship's party the following day, which coincides with Shaw's move to Flair's building. While Flair's men pack up Shaw's equipment, Sailor O'Shea arrives to take Shaw to the Sheba's party. While at the party Shaw receives a surprise - Flair and Captain Shipley both agreed that Shaw would be happier running his own business, and would love to do so while on a ship; thus, Captain Shipley appoints Shaw \\"Ship's Shoemaker\\" and relocates Shaw's entire business to the Sheba, just in time for Sheba's upcoming around-the-world trip. The story ends with Shaw and Shoo-Shoo having traveled around the world 10 times, with Shaw's business aboard the Sheba being as busy as ever.

The Security Council welcomed the transitional period in which peace, stability and reconciliation were brought about under the leadership of Norodom Sihanouk, now King of Cambodia. A newly adopted constitution, establishment of a government and conclusion of elections in accordance with the Paris Agreements was welcomed, allowing the Council to declare that the objectives of the agreements had been fulfilled. Tributes were paid to the Member States which contributed personnel to UNTAC while condolences were paid to those that lost nationals. The rapid delivery of international assistance towards rehabilitation, reconstruction and development in Cambodia and towards peace-building was stressed, as was the need to ensure the safety of withdrawing UNTAC personnel and the continuity of mine clearance. The resolution again welcomed the accession of King Norodom Sihanouk, who played an important role in the peace process. It also welcomed the formation of a new government and celebrated the work of UNTAC for its role in Cambodia. At the same time, Member States were urged to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia and demanded all attacks by the Khmer faction against the Government of Cambodia or UNTAC cease. Given Cambodia's history, the respect for international humanitarian law in the country was affirmed, requesting countries to provide technical experts and equipment and voluntary contributions. The withdrawal of the military component UNTAC by 15 November 1993, as provided for in Resolution 860 (1993) would go ahead, while extending the mandate of mine clearance and training unit until 30 November 1993 and military police and medical components by 31 December 1993. A team of 20 military observers was then established, known as the United Nations Military Liaison Team (UNMLT) to monitor the situation in the country after the withdrawal of UNTAC. The intention of the Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's intention to appoint a person to coordinate the United Nations presence in Cambodia was welcomed, as was his intention to report on the lessons learned during the course of the entire UNTAC operation.

Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the , the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus. While Bach served as Thomaskantor ‚Äì director of church music ‚Äì in Leipzig from 1723, he performed the cantata several times, sometimes in a different key and with changes in the scoring. Musicologists agree that he loved the cantata's Gospel text, \\"If ye love me ...\\", and the Pentecost hymn used in the duet, setting both the text and the hymn several times. John Eliot Gardiner writes that Bach \\"particularly valued\\" this cantata. It contains features that he used again in later compositions of cantatas, oratorios and his masses, for example movements with three trumpets and timpani in a triple meter for festive occasions, and duets as a symbol of God and man.  Background  Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year ‚Äì Sundays and feast days ‚Äì a project that he pursued for three years. Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co- reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in M√ºhlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein K√∂nig, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. Wilhelm Ernst, In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the , the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the , (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) , on a text by Erdmann Neumeister. In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow. Zachow had taught the young George Frideric Handel, and composed many church cantatas in the new style, adopting recitatives and arias from the Italian opera. Bach was successful in his application for the position, but declined after Duke Wilhelm Ernst increased his salary and offered him a promotion. Bach was promoted to on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the : With the appointment, he received the title Konzertmeister and new privileges: Circumstances were favourable: Bach enjoyed a \\"congenial and intimate\\" space in the court chapel, called (Heaven's Castle), and a professional group of musicians in the court capelle. He was inspired by a collaboration with the court poet Salomon Franck, who provided the texts for most of his church cantatas, capturing a \\"pure, straightforward theological message\\" in \\"elegant poetic language\\". The first two cantatas Bach composed in Weimar based on Franck's texts were , for Palm Sunday, which coincided with the Annunciation that year, and for Jubilate Sunday. One month after Erschallet, ihr Lieder, Bach performed Ich hatte viel Bek√ºmmernis, BWV 21, on the third Sunday after Trinity, again on a text by Franck. Erschallet, ihr Lieder, the third cantata in this series, is the first cantata for a feast day.  Occasion and words  Portrait of the young Bach (disputed) is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet. Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"\\". Nicolai's \\"Geistlich Brautlied\\" (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.  Performances and theme  With Bach's appointment to concert master and his regular monthly cantata compositions, he achieved permission to hold rehearsals in the church, to ensure high performance standards: \\"the rehearsing of the pieces at the home [of the capellmeister] has been changed, and it is ordered that it must always take place at the [the music gallery in the palace church], and this is also to be observed by the \\". The orchestra at his disposition consisted of the members of the court cappelle, three leaders, five singers and seven instrumentalists, augmented on demand by military musicians, town musicians and choristers from a gymnasium. Bach conducted the first performance of on 20 May 1714. His son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach remembered that he often conducted and played first violin: \\"he played the violin cleanly and penetratingly, and thus kept the orchestra in better order than he could have done with the harpsichord\\". The parts for the first performance are lost, but the score and performing material for later performances have survived. Bach performed the cantata again, possibly in K√∂then between 1717 and 1722, and several times as in Leipzig. For the performance on 28 May 1724, he changed the instrumentation slightly and transposed the work from C major to D major. He reverted to C major for a performance on 13 May 1731. An organ part for a later performance of movement 5 is extant. John Eliot Gardiner remarked that Bach \\"particularly valued\\" this cantata, and that it set \\"a pattern for his later approaches to the Pentecostal theme\\". Bach set the Gospel text of the recitative in a choral movement in other cantatas for Pentecost ‚Äì , and .  Music = Scoring and structure  In the Weimar version, Bach scored the cantata four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and an orchestra of three trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), recorder (Fl) or flauto traverso (Ft), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va), bassoon (Fg), cello (Vc), and basso continuo (Bc). It is a festive, rich instrumentation for the holiday, whereas the previous two cantatas in Weimar had not employed brass instruments. Bach used the French string orchestra with two viola parts, as in most cantatas until 1715, when he started to prefer the Italian scoring with one viola. In Weimar, a recorder or flauto traverso doubled the first violin an octave higher; in the first Leipzig performance it was a flauto traverso. A part for obbligato organ (Org) replacing oboe and cello in movement 5 was adopted in an even later performance. The work is about 25 minutes long. In the Weimar version and the 1724 version, Bach requested a repeat of the opening chorus, by adding after the chorale . In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Weimar version of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the list of Bach cantatas. The keys are given for the Weimar version. The time signature is provided using the symbol for common time ().  Movements  John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, in 2007 The cantata text does not tell a story but reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted all Bach's church cantatas in 2000, placed the Pentecostal cantatas in the middle of the project, which he saw as a \\"year-long exploration of his cantatas in their seasonal context\\". He described Pentecost as \\"the culmination of those 'great fifty days' which follow the Resurrection, a watershed marking the completion of Jesus' work on earth and the coming of the Holy Spirit\\", and commented that Bach \\"comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of ... the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier\\". Regarding , the first cantata written for the occasion, he observed that Bach reflects the \\"stages in the evolving relationship of God with man\\", both by scoring and by his choice of keys. In the Weimar first version, the key of the first movements is C major, lowered to A minor (a third lower) in the fourth, lowered further to F major (again a third lower) in the fifth and sixth. The scoring is majestic, with three trumpets and timpani in movement 1 and three trumpets again in movement 3, reduced to strings in movement 4 and to single instruments in movement 5. = 1 = Natural trumpet, copy by Francisco P√©rez after \\"\\" (literally: sound, you songs) is a festive concerto, marked by Bach. Words and music are possibly based on an earlier lost secular (congratulatory cantata). A printing of Franck's works contains a cantata for New Year's Day, (Sound again, congratulating songs) that may have served as a model. The movement is in da capo form: the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section. It is scored for three \\"choirs\\": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-part chorus. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, appears again in the time signature and in the use of three trumpets. The first part opens with trumpet fanfares, alternating with flowing coloraturas in the strings. The voices enter as a third homophonic choir. They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word \\"Erschallet\\" (resound!), as the trumpets echo the motif. The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on \\"ihr Lieder\\", and the trumpets echo it again. The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on \\"erklinget, ihr Saiten\\", commanding the strings to play. As a culmination, the first syllable of \\"\\" (most blessed times) is held on a seventh chord (first in measure 53), during which the instruments play their motifs. In the middle section in A minor the trumpets rest while the other instruments play with the voices. Polyphonic imitation expands on the idea that God will prepare the souls to be his temples. The first sequence progresses from the lowest to the highest voice, with entrances after two or three measures. The highest voice begins the second sequence, and the other voices enter in closer succession, one or two measures apart. Gardiner interprets the polyphony as \\"conjuring before us the elegant tracery of those 'temples' which God promises to make of our souls\\". The first part is repeated as da capo. The movement is comparable to the opening of T√∂net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten! BWV 214 (Resound, ye drums! Ring out, ye trumpets!) composed in 1733 on another text calling instruments to sound, which Bach later used with a different text to open his Christmas Oratorio. Bach used a festive scoring with three trumpets in triple meter in his 1733 for the court in Dresden, in the Gloria, in contrast to the preceding Kyrie. = 2 = The cantata's only recitative quotes one line from the Gospel reading of the day: \\"\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word[, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him]). Bach reflects Jesus' promise to \\"make Our dwelling with him\\" in melismatic lines in counterpoint with motifs in the cello similar to motifs in movement 5. He assigned the words of Jesus to the bass as the (voice of Christ). He illustrates the final rest in God by ending the solo line on a whole note low C, the lowest note he demanded of a soloist. The musicologist Julian Mincham describes the vocal line: > The initial bars of melody are warm and quietly authoritative, but at the > mention of dwelling with Him the movement takes on a very different > character. The bass line becomes enlivened with little leaps of delight ... > The singer's last note is a bottom d (c in the transposed version) several > notes lower than a bass's accepted range. ... when achieved it is an > arresting sound, confirming the rock-like certainty of the promise that we > shall eventually reside with God. = 3 = The first aria, addressing the Trinity, \\"\\" (Holiest Trinity), is accompanied by a choir of three trumpets and basso continuo, a rare combination that expresses the idea of the words. The trumpet is a symbol of a ruler. The three trumpets sometimes play in unison, to further illustrate the Trinity. The theme is composed of the three notes of the major chord. The aria is in three sections. Bach wrote an aria accompanied by only an obbligato brass instrument again in his Missa of 1733 in B minor, composed for the court in Dresden and much later integrated into his Mass in B minor. The bass aria Quoniam tu solus sanctus, reflecting God's holiness and majesty, is set for corno da caccia, two bassoons and basso continuo. When he assembled the complete mass, he used an aria with only woodwinds to reflect the Holy Spirit in Et in Spiritum Sanctum, also a movement with many symbols of the Trinity. = 4 = Baroque violin by Jacob Stainer, 1658 The second aria, for tenor, \\"\\" (O paradise of the soul), also contains three sections and a triple meter, but in contrast to the previous movement, describes in continuous waves of the unison strings the Spirit that was present at the Creation, worded (O paradise of the soul, fanned by the Spirit of God, which blew at creation). Alfred D√ºrr wrote that the music \\"conveys the impression of release from all earthly gravity\\". = 5 = The last solo movement, a duet aria, \\"\\" (Come, do not keep me waiting longer), consists of a dialogue between the Soul and the Holy Spirit, and takes a form close to a love lyric. The part of the Spirit is assigned to the alto, while similar duets of the Soul and Jesus in later cantatas are set for soprano and bass ‚Äì for example in Ich hatte viel Bek√ºmmernis, BWV 21 and Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140. Baroque oboe d'amore Bach set the text in a complex structure uniting two singers, a solo oboe and a solo cello. The soprano and alto sing of their unity in \\"neo- erotic\\" or \\"overtly erotic/Pietistic\\" language: \\"I shall die, if I have to be without you\\" the one; \\"I am yours, and you are mine!\\" the other. The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout, which Albert Schweitzer describes as \\"a motif of purified happiness\\". The voices and the cello form a trio, another symbol of the Trinity. The musicologist Anne Leahy of the Dublin Institute of Technology notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind, which speaks of love, and used the instrument which is named after love. The oboe d'amore plays the richly ornamented melody of the Pentecost hymn \\"\\" (\\"Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God, fill with the goodness of Your grace the hearts, wills, and minds of Your faithful. Ignite Your burning love in them\\".) Bach set this hymn, which seems close to his heart, twice in his Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, as BWV 651 and BWV 652. Bach used duets again when he composed in 1733 his (Kyrie and Gloria) in B minor for the court in Dresden, which he later integrated into his Mass in B minor. He wrote two duets movements in the style of contemporary operatic love duets and placed two of them in the centre of each part of the Missa: Christe eleison for two sopranos in the centre of the Kyrie, in the centre of the symmetrical structure of the Gloria. When he compiled the Mass in B minor, he chose another duet for the Credo, scored for soprano and alto, as in Erschallet, ihr Lieder. = 6 = \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\", first publication of the hymn by Philipp Nicolai, 1599 The text of the concluding chorale is taken from Nicolai's \\"Geistlich Brautlied\\" (Spiritual bridal song) \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\", continuing the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit. \\"\\" (A joyful radiance reaches me from God) is illustrated by a violin part added to the four-part choir. The text ends with the words: Until 1724 the opening chorus was repeated after the chorale, marked \\"chorus repetatur ab initio\\" in the manuscript. Gardiner describes the cantata as \\"evidently ... a work which he particularly valued\\", adding: \\"he comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of the first gifts of newly-awakened nature, as well as the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier.\\" D√ºrr comments:  Publication  The cantata was published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1888 in volume 35 of the first complete edition of Bach's works by the Bach Gesellschaft, edited by Alfred D√∂rffel. In the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, the second complete edition of Bach's works, in the historical-critical edition, Dietrich Kilian edited both the reconstructed Weimar version (1959) and the first Leipzig version (1960) in volume 13, adding the critical report in 1960.

The novel, Jarry's last, revolves around a race between a train and a team of cyclists fuelled by perpetual-motion food and the exploits of a \\"supermale\\" capable of prodigious feats of endurance and sexual athleticism. Supermale was translated into English by Barbara Wright in 1968. Plot A large part of the novel takes place on Andre Marcueil's estate, Chateau de Lurance. It is set in the 1920s, the near future when it was written. During a dinner party at the mansion of Andre Marcueil, the main character, several guests discuss the nature of love. Arthur Gough, William Elson, Dr. Bathybius, and the host propose four definitions of love. Love is thought to be an emotion, an impression on the soul, an enfeebled sensation and (which Andre tries to prove) an activity. The story then flashes back to Andre‚Äôs childhood, introducing the idea of the Supermale. Andre, a sexually- repressed 10-year-old, is confused about his body. He begins taking bromide and exercising to become super-strong. Back at the dinner party, the discussion becomes earthier with the women absent. The men begin speculating about how many times a person can have sex in one day, and Andre tries to demonstrate his strength by breaking a dynamometer. As the dinner party ends, Andre and Ellen have a sexual conversation and she admires the roses on his property. As soon as she leaves, he orders his servant to cut them down. The story switches to the 10,000-mile race. A five-person bicycle is racing a train full of spectators, including Ellen. Perpetual-motion food is giving them the strength and stamina to keep up with the train. One of the cyclists dies, but the bicycle speeds up. The cyclists notice a mysterious shadow in the background, which passes them. They finish a day and a half ahead of schedule but instead of finding cheering fans, they find roses at the finish line. At another dinner party in Andre‚Äôs mansion, the police appear and announce that they have found a girl who was raped and murdered on the estate; the matter is taken very lightly. Andre, trying to see how many times the girl can endure sex with him, is the culprit; this dents his heroic reputation. Seven prostitutes begin to roam the mansion, and find themselves in a room. They hear mysterious footsteps, and assume that an \\"Indian\\" is coming for them. Trapped in the room for hours, they begin eating their cosmetics. Bathybius, in the study, returns to his notes to find something unusual he had written and considers the potential of God compared to man. The \\"Indian\\" (Andre) meets a disguised Ellen. Ellen tells Andre that she had locked the seven prostitutes in a room. They begin an experiment, with Bathybius observing and keeping count in a nearby room, and set a new record of 82 episodes of lovemaking (breaking the old record of 70). During one of their breaks, Ellen falls asleep and Bathybius enters the room. Andre (as the Indian) greets him with \\"Who art thou, human creature?\\" The gallery is filled with people. The Indian is carried to where the people are, and they speculate that he can revive them by producing offspring with supreme qualities. However, the Indian says that he is sterile (much to their dismay). He returns to the room where Ellen is sleeping. The prostitutes break the window in their room, causing a commotion to get Andre‚Äôs attention. Irritated, he drowns them out with a phonograph. They continue, while Bathybius observes them from another room. Andre realizes that his theory about love was wrong; sex does not equal love, since he has not fallen in love with Ellen. After he sees Ellen apparently dead (although she is asleep, he writes a poem for her about Helen of Troy and the carnage she caused). He falls into a deep sleep, murmuring \\"I adore her\\". Andre is revealed as the Indian, and William Elson is convinced that Andre must love Ellen. It is agreed that a love machine (similar to an electric chair) must be built to force Andre to love Ellen. While Andre is still faint from the sex marathon, he is strapped to the love machine. He awakens when 11,000 volts are sent through his body, causing him to break free of his chair and try to escape, but he dies. Over time, Ellen eventually gets over Andre, and marries a man who can keep his love within human capacities. Characters *Andre Marcueil - The \\"Supermale\\" of the novel, whose exploits are described in third-person narration. At first, Andre seems to be a misunderstood, psychologically-scarred man with supernatural abilities. However, after the death of the girl on the Lurance estate he is revealed as callous and inhuman. Throughout the novel, Andre seeks to push human boundaries. *The Indian - Andre's alter ego, a quiet, handsome, athletic-looking man. When Andre sets out to break the record, he disguises himself as an Indian (complete with tomahawk and makeup). *Ellen Elson - Andre's love interest, although he does not appreciate her until he thinks she is dead.

Moule's undated watercolour, depicting Grange Court, Leominster, Herefordshire, in its original state and location He was born at Gillingham, Dorset on 25 September 1825, the eldest of eight sons of Henry Moule, and educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, gaining a B.A. in 1848 and M.A. in 1853. He then spent some years as a private tutor, secretary and librarian, to the family of Lord Wriothesley Russell (son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford) and then the Earl Fitzwilliam at Wentworth Woodhouse. He spent the years 1862 - 1877 in Scotland, and then (after a brief sojourn in Ireland) returned to Dorset (where he had grown up). In 1883 he was appointed the first curator of the Dorset County Museum, a post he held until his death on 13 March 1904; he left several thousand paintings to the museum. He was a close friend of Thomas Hardy for fifty years, their first meeting being shortly before 1854. He was 15 years older than Thomas Hardy, and it seems likely that they met when Henry returned from University to his Father's vicarage at Fordington and Hardy was still quite young. There can be no doubt they were close friends as he encouraged Hardy's development from an impressionable age, was a regular visitor to the Hardy household, and in later life taught Thomas how to paint. At this time the Moule family were also friendly with the Reverend William Barnes, the Dorset poet and philologist who also acted as a mentor to Thomas Hardy.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Mikosch surrendered to the Red Army in April 1945; he remained in captivity until 1955. Biography Born in 1898, Mikosch volunteered for the army of Imperial Germany in 1914. After two years service in World War I, he received a commission in an engineer battalion. After the war, he joined the police force where he remained for several years until he rejoined the German Army in 1935 as an engineer. With the rank of Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel), he commanded the 51st Engineer Battalion which fought in the Battle of Poland in 1939 and assisted in the capture of Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium on 11 May 1940. Shortly afterwards, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Promoted to Oberst (colonel) in 1942, Mikosch was commander of the 677th Pioneer Regiment, which took part in the Battle of Stalingrad and saw him awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, and the following year, was temporary commander of the 10th Panzergrenadier Division from late July to late December, during which it fought in Operation Citadel and the Battle of Kiev. He then took command of the 13th Panzer Division on 23 December. His new command, which had been heavily engaged on the Eastern Front, was withdrawn from the front and underwent a refit. During this time he was promoted to Generalmajor (equivalent to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Army). On its return to the front, the 13th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket and the subsequent retreat to the Bug River. After his period in command of the 13th Panzer Division ended in May 1944, Mikosch took up a post as commandant of the town of Boulogne in France. He later commanded Higher Engineering Command XIII and then towards the end of the war, he was responsible for fortifications in East Prussia. Having been promoted to Generalleutnant (equivalent to the rank of major general in the United States Army) the previous month, he surrendered to the Soviet forces on 8 April 1945. He was held in the Soviet Union for over 10 years before being released. He later lived in Westphalia, where he died in 1993.

Trump's first accusation was in a May 17, 2018, tweet in which he quoted Andrew C. McCarthy, who had just appeared on Fox & Friends repeating assertions from his May 12 article for National Review. Trump made more assertions, without providing evidence, on May 18 and May 22‚Äì23, 2018, adding that it was done in an effort to help Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, win the general election. He said a supposed spy, later identified as professor Stefan Halper, was paid a \\"massive amount of money\\" for doing so. In the middle and second half of 2016, Halper, a longtime confidential source for U.S. intelligence, began working as a secret informant for the FBI, targeting three Trump campaign advisers separately in a covert effort to investigate suspected Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. However, as of May 2018, the Trump administration had produced no evidence that Halper had actually joined the Trump campaign or that the predication for his surveillance of the campaign was improper. On June 5, 2018, Trump further alleged that a counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign had been running since December 2015. The House Intelligence Committee, then in Republican control, concluded in an April 2018 report that the FBI counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign did not begin until late July 2016, while the February 2018 Nunes memo written by Republican aides reached the same conclusion, as did the February 2018 rebuttal memo by committee Democrats. Whether the use of the FISA warrant, which permits investigators to collect archived communications well prior to the issuance of the warrant, includes the December 2015 date remains partially classified. Political commenters and high-ranking politicians from both sides of the political spectrum have dismissed Trump's allegations as lacking evidence and maintained that the FBI's use of Halper as a covert informant was in no way improper. Trump's claims about when the counterintelligence investigation was initiated have been shown to be false. A December 2019 Justice Department Inspector General report \\"found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any [Confidential Human Sources] within the Trump campaign, recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHSs, or task CHSs to report on the Trump campaign.\\" Spygate is similar to but distinct from Trump's March 2017 assertion that President Obama \\"had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower,\\" which the Trump Justice Department stated was untrue in September 2017 and October 2018 federal court briefs. It is also part of Trump's larger list of spying allegations against the Obama administration.https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/08/trump-is- desperate-so-obamagate-is-back-it-still-makes-no-sense/ Background= Origins of FBI investigation  In early February 2018, the Nunes memo ‚Äî written by aides of Republican Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee ‚Äî confirmed that a tip about George Papadopoulos \\"triggered the opening of\\" the original FBI counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia in late July 2016.Multiple sources: # # # # # # # Later that month, a rebuttal memo by committee Democrats stated that \\"the FBI initiated its counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016\\". In April 2018, the House Intelligence Committee, then in Republican control, released a final report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which stated that the House Intelligence Committee found that \\"in late July 2016, the FBI opened an enterprise CI [counterintelligence] investigation into the Trump campaign following the receipt of derogatory information about foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\\". In March 2019, Nunes, the then-ranking member of the committee, asserted that it was \\"for certain\\" false that the FBI investigation began in late July 2016 as his earlier report had found, but media reports offered no further evidence or explanation from Nunes on this claim. On May 16, 2018, The New York Times reported the existence of a 2016 FBI investigation named Crossfire Hurricane tasked with investigating whether individuals within the Trump campaign had inappropriate or illegal links to Russian efforts to interfere with the election. Four individuals ‚Äî Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos ‚Äî were initially investigated because of such ties. During the investigation, the FBI obtained phone records and other documents using national security letters. The Times also reported that FBI agents, believing that Trump would lose the election, and cognizant of Trump's claims that the election was rigged against him, tried to avoid allowing the investigation to become public as they feared that Trump would blame his defeat on the revelation of the investigation. Stefan Halper spoke to Trump campaign advisers, but there is no evidence that Halper had actually joined Trump's campaign.  Activities of Stefan Halper  Stefan Halper, an FBI informant, spoke separately to three Trump campaign advisers ‚Äì Carter Page, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos ‚Äì in 2016 in an effort to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. There is no evidence that Halper had actually joined Trump's campaign. Page said that he \\"had extensive discussions\\" with Halper on \\"a bunch of different foreign-policy- related topics\\", ending in September 2017. A former federal law enforcement official told The New York Times that the initial encounter between Halper and Page at a London symposium on July 11‚Äì12, 2016 was a coincidence, rather than at the direction of the FBI. Clovis's attorney said that Clovis and Halper had discussed China during their sole meeting on August 31 or September 1, 2016, and Clovis stated in May 2018 that it appeared Halper was only offering his assistance to the campaign. The New York Times reported that on September 15, 2016 Halper asked Papadopoulos if he knew of any campaign coordination with Russian efforts to disrupt the election campaign; Papadopoulos twice denied he did, notwithstanding Joseph Mifsud telling him the previous April that Russians had Hillary Clinton emails, and Papadopoulos bragging about it to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in May. WikiLeaks released DNC emails on July 22, and four days later the Australian government informed the FBI of Downer's conversation with Papadopoulos, triggering the opening of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections on July 31.The failure of the FBI to include Papadopoulos's exculpatory statement to Stefan Halper denying that the Trump campaign was involved in the DNC email hack in its FISA application or to notify the FISA court thereafter was cited in the Inspector General's report as one of the principal faults of the Crossfire Hurricane Operation. Papadopoulos was paid $3,000 by Halper for a research paper on the oil fields of Turkey, Israel and Cyprus. In April 2019, The New York Times reported that the FBI had asked Halper to approach Page and Papadopoulos, although it was not clear if he had been asked to contact Clovis. In May 2019, the Times reported that Page had urged Halper to meet with Clovis and that the FBI was aware of the meeting but had not instructed Halper to ask Clovis about Russia matters. The Times also reported that the FBI also sent an investigator under the pseudonym Azra Turk to meet with Papadopoulos, while posing as Halper's assistant. The Times stated that the FBI considered it essential to add a trained and trusted investigator like Ms.Turk as a \\"layer of oversight,\\" in the event the investigation was ultimately prosecuted and the government needed the credible testimony of such an individual, without exposing Halper as a longtime confidential informant. The 2019 Inspector General report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation contained additional details about Halper's contacts with these three campaign members. The report describes him as \\"an FBI CHS\\" and notes that \\"the Crossfire Hurricane team conducted three CHS [confidential human source] operations prior to the team's initial receipt of Steele's reporting on September 9, 2016. All three CHS operations were with individuals who were still with the Trump campaign.\\" The first meeting, in August 2016, was a consensually recorded meeting with Carter Page. The second meeting, in September 2016, was with \\"a high-level official in the Trump campaign who was not a subject of the investigation\\", likely Clovis. It too was a \\"consensually recorded meeting\\" and was \\"about Papadopoulos and Carter Page\\". \\"Little information\\" was received by Halper. The third meeting, in September 2016, was with Papadopoulos.  Exposure of Stefan Halper  In late April 2018, Devin Nunes sent a classified subpoena to the Justice Department. In response, the Justice Department rejected the request for information \\"regarding a specific individual\\". On May 8, 2018, The Washington Post described this individual as \\"a top-secret intelligence source\\" and \\"a U.S. citizen who has provided intelligence to the CIA and FBI.\\" On May 17, 2018, The Daily Caller reported that Stefan Halper, a professor at Cambridge known for his work for the CIA, had met Trump campaign advisors Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. On May 18, The New York Times and The Washington Post separately published articles about an FBI informant gathering information from Trump campaign officials. Neither newspaper would then name the FBI informant, but the Times described him as an \\"American academic who teaches in Britain\\" who contacted Page and Papadopoulos, while the Post reported that he is \\"a retired American professor\\" who met Page \\"at a British university\\". New York described that putting the information in the Caller, Post and Times reports together \\"all but confirm\\" Halper as the FBI informant.  Trump and his allies' allegations = May 2018  On May 17, 2018, Trump tweeted: On May 18, Trump made the following statement on Twitter: On May 22, Trump made the following accusation on Twitter: A day later, he followed up with a related tweet: Soon after this series of tweets, it was widely reported in the media that Trump's allegations of politically motivated spying were unsubstantiated. Trump has not offered any evidence for Spygate when asked for it, instead saying: \\"All you have to do is look at the basics and you'll see it.\\" It was also widely reported that Trump's allegations were intended to discredit the Mueller Investigation. The Associated Press added that Trump had said he wanted \\"to brand\\" the informant as a \\"spy,\\" as using a more nefarious term than \\"informant\\" would supposedly resonate more with the public. In the May 22 tweets, Trump wrote that Halper, a longtime FBI informant, was paid a \\"massive amount of money\\" and concluded that he thus must be a spy implanted for \\"political purposes\\". Although the Defense department's Office of Net Assessment had paid Halper more than $1 million in contracts between 2012 and 2016 for \\"research and development in the social sciences and humanities,\\" Halper subcontracted some of this work to other researchers, with about 40% of the money awarded before Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, and it is unknown whether the FBI paid Halper at all. Halper worked for the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations and continued as a State and Defense department advisor until 2001. He had been considered for an ambassadorship in the Trump administration. In the May 23 tweets, Trump misquoted former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, attributing to him the statement that \\"Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign.\\" Instead, when asked \\"Was the FBI spying on Trump's campaign?\\", Clapper said, \\"No, they were not.\\" Clapper added that, although he does not \\"particularly like\\" the term \\"spying,\\" he thinks that Trump should have been happy that the FBI was \\"spying on ... what the Russians were doing,\\" and that the FBI were trying to determine whether the Russians were infiltrating his campaign, or trying to influence the election. Clapper later said that while some of the surveillance fit the dictionary definition of \\"spying,\\" he objected strongly to the use of the term because of its misleading connotations. On May 26, Trump questioned \\"why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or 'Justice' contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?\\" NBC News reported in December 2017 that on July 19, 2016, after Trump won the Republican nomination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned him that foreign adversaries, including Russia, would probably attempt to spy on and infiltrate his campaign. Trump was told to alert the FBI of any suspicious activity. On May 27, when Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani was asked whether the promotion of the Spygate theory was meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, he replied that the investigators \\"are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president ... it is for public opinion\\" on whether to \\"impeach or not impeach\\" Trump.  June 2018  On June 5, Trump made new accusations on Twitter: However, the December 2015 texts do not make any reference to the Trump campaign or Russia. This particular conspiracy theory promoted by Trump was traced by media outlets to originate from a Twitter user called @Nick_Falco, who on June 4 posted about the words \\"oconus lures\\" in December 2015 texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. While \\"oconus\\" refers to \\"outside the continental United States\\", Falco inferred that \\"lures\\" refer to spies. However, according to the United States Department of Justice, \\"lures\\" refer to \\"subterfuge to entice a criminal defendant to leave a foreign country so that he or she can be arrested\\". Falco suggested that the FBI may have \\"wanted to run a baited Sting Op using foreign agents against Trump,\\" despite none of the texts mentioning the Trump campaign or Russia. Also on June 4, Falco's tweet spread to the r/conspiracy forum on Reddit, and also The Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website which has published multiple false conspiracy theories. The Gateway Pundit wrote an article entitled: \\"Breaking: Senate releases unredacted texts showing FBI initiated MULTIPLE SPIES in Trump campaign in December 2015\\". However, the texts referenced by Falco were publicly released by a Senate committee months earlier in February 2018. On June 5, Lou Dobbs of Fox Business said that \\"the FBI may have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015\\". Dobbs's interviewee on the show, Chris Farrell of the conservative group Judicial Watch, agreed that the existence of an \\"intelligence operation directed against then-candidate Trump\\" was \\"indisputable\\". Trump's June 5 tweet on Spygate came less than an hour after he watched Dobbs's interview, with Trump tweeting praise of Dobbs for the \\"great interview\\". After Trump made his June 5 tweet, Fox News described the news as \\"New Strzok-Page texts released\\", with Fox News television host Laura Ingraham saying: \\"It certainly appears they were looking to put more lures into the campaign in 2015.\\" Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a panelist on Ingraham's show, agreed that it was \\"clear\\" that the FBI investigation into Trump started earlier than July 2016. After receiving information about George Papadopoulos's activities, the FBI began surveilling the Trump campaign to see if it was coordinating with the Russian's interference efforts. The revelation prompted the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into the Trump campaign, which started on July 31, 2016. Reactions and criticism= May 2018  Shortly after Trump's allegation, several members of Congress received a classified briefing on the matter from the Justice Department. Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a former federal prosecutor, stated after the briefing: Gowdy retracted this remark three weeks later indicating that his statement relied on briefings and \\"the word of the FBI and the DOJ‚Äù and that he should have insisted on seeing the actual documents. After a four hour session reviewing documents at the Department of Justice, Gowdy said that was the first time he saw that Peter Strzok had actually initiated and approved Crossfire Hurricane, the exculpatory information on George Papadopoulos, and also the first time he saw, despite the testimonial denials of the FBI that \\"Trump‚Äôs not the target, the campaign‚Äôs not the target‚Äù of the Crossfire Hurricane, the Trump campaign mentioned in the predicate document.url= https://www.nationalreview.com/news/gowdy-admits-he-was-wrong-to-trust-the- word-of-the-fbi-and-the-doj-during-russiagate/work= The National Review] access-date=June 13, 2020}} Senior Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, supported Gowdy's initial assessment of the situation. Republican Representative Tom Rooney, who is on the House Intelligence Committee, chided Trump for creating \\"this thing to tweet about knowing that it's not true.... Maybe it's just to create more chaos.\\" Republican senator Jeff Flake has said that the \\"so-called Spygate\\" is a \\"diversion tactic, obviously\\". while Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that \\"it appears that there was an investigation not of the campaign but of certain individuals who have a history that we should be suspicious of that predate the presidential campaign of 2015, 2016\\". Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has said that Spygate is \\"lie-gate\\", a \\"piece of propaganda the president wants to put out and repeat\\". He accused President Trump of repeatedly spreading baseless lies by quoting that \\"people are saying ...\\" or \\"we've been told ...\\". Michael Hayden, a retired general, former Director of the National Security Agency and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said that Trump, through Spygate, was \\"simply trying to delegitimize the Mueller investigation, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and he's willing to throw almost anything against the wall\\". Haaretz, Chris Megerian and Eli Stokols of Los Angeles Times, and Kyle Cheney of Politico have labelled Spygate as a conspiracy theory by President Trump. Journalist Shepard Smith has said that \\"Fox News knows of no evidence to support the president's claim. Lawmakers from both parties say using an informant to investigate is not spying. It's part of the normal investigative process.\\" Former judge and Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano also stated that the use of an informant was part of standard procedure. Zack Beauchamp of Vox said that \\"Trump's misconception\\" appeared to come from a May 12 article by Andrew C. McCarthy and his May 17 Fox & Friends appearance \\"just before Trump tweeted about the Halper case for the first time\\". Trump made his first accusation in a May 17 tweet quoting McCarthy. Washington Post columnist Max Boot described Spygate as the latest example in a \\"nonstop\\" series of Trump's \\"nonsensical\\" allegations of a \\"Deep State\\" conspiracy against him. According to Boot, this included Trump's March 2017 Trump Tower wiretapping allegations refuted by Trump's own Justice Department, and Trump's January 2018 allegations that texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were tantamount to \\"treason\\" ‚Äî allegations that Trump made despite the fact that there was no evidence of an anti-Trump conspiracy. Jon Meacham, a presidential historian, has said, in regard to Spygate: \\"The effect on the life of the nation of a president inventing conspiracy theories in order to distract attention from legitimate investigations or other things he dislikes is corrosive.\\" Aaron Blake, writing for The Washington Post, wrote that the \\"central problem\\" of the Spygate conspiracy theory is the \\"fact that these people who supposedly would do anything to stop Trump ... didn't\\". In the period before the election, the FBI \\"didn't use the information it had collected to actually prevent Trump from becoming president\\", as it did not publicly reveal it was already investigating links between George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Russia. Rather, the reports before the election were that the FBI saw no clear link between Russia and the Trump campaign, instead believing that Russia was trying to disrupt the election without purposely trying to elect Trump. Steven Poole, writing for The Guardian, wrote that the real scandal was Trump using the \\"-gate\\" suffix for the issue, as the Spygate allegations are about \\"purely imaginary things\\". CNN's Josh Campbell and Slate's Dahlia Lithwick felt that Trump was carrying out the act of rebranding, with Trump describing an \\"informant\\" as a \\"spy\\", and describing legal counter-intelligence gathering as illegitimate \\"deep state spying\\" and \\"Spygate\\".  June 2018  The New York magazine addressed the June 2018 allegations by stating: \\"It's not surprising or scandalous that FBI agents would be using espionage tradecraft. Gateway Pundit seems to have invented the crucial factual element of the conspiracy out of thin air\\" while \\"Trump is citing right-wing conspiracy theorists who operate at a full level further removed from reality than the right-wing conspiracy theorists he customarily cites.\\" Zack Beauchamp of Vox said that \\"the FBI's investigation into Trump didn't open until July 2016\\" and that Trump's June 2018 allegation that a counterintelligence operation into his campaign was active in 2015 was based on an interpretation of the Strzok-Page texts that was \\"entirely unfounded in the actual evidence.\\" Beauchamp claimed that this was an instance of a pattern in which \\"Fox picks up on some random internet rumor, the president picks it up from Fox, and then Fox and other right-wing outlets leap to defend what the president tweeted, which only reinforces Trump's sense that he's right.\\" After reporting on both Trump's May 2018 and June 2018 tweets, Beauchamp wrote that the ‚Äúbest way to analyze 'Spygate' is ... a conspiracy theory... a ginned-up controversy Trump has capitalized on to justify his argument that the FBI is hopelessly biased against him‚Äù.  August 2018  On August 31, 2018, Trisha B. Anderson, who was the Deputy General Counsel of the FBI's Office of General Counsel in the counterintelligence operation of the Trump campaign, testified that \\"To my knowledge, the FBI did not place anybody within a campaign but, rather, relied upon its network of sources, some of whom already had campaign contacts.\\"U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Trisha B. Anderson, Principal Deputy General Counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of General Council, Redacted, August 31, 2018, p. 221.  2019 Inspector General report  A December 2019 Justice Department Inspector General report \\"found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any [Confidential Human Sources] within the Trump campaign, recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHSs, or task CHSs to report on the Trump campaign.\\" Attorney General Bill Barr, who had testified to Congress in April 2019, \\"I think spying did occur,\\" issued a statement upon release of the inspector general's report in which he characterized the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation as \\"intrusive,\\" but within the context of the FBI wiretap on former Trump aide Carter Page, rather than on the question of whether any individual had been directed to spy on the campaign. The inspector general determined that the FBI made 17 errors or omissions ‚Äî some of them severe ‚Äî in its FISA warrant applications for Page, although Horowitz attributed the warrant problems to \\"gross incompetence and negligence\\" rather than intentional malfeasance or political bias. Barr and his designated investigator John Durham also had for months been investigating a conspiracy theory that an alleged Western intelligence operative had been directed to contact and entrap Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos in order to establish a false predicate to justify opening Crossfire Hurricane.  Other uses  Reports from ABC News, Fox News and NBC News in May 2018 state that Trump used the term 'Spygate' for the claim that the FBI spied on his campaign using a confidential informant. Glen Kessler of The Washington Post wrote in May 2018 that the term 'Spygate' \\"refers to the news that the FBI obtained information from an informant ‚Äî Stefan Halper, an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge ‚Äî who met with at least three members of Trump‚Äôs campaign staff suspected of having links to Russia.\\" Kessler suggested that Trump's use of 'Spygate' was the latest in a series of Trump's attempts to discredit and obfuscate the Mueller investigation, and that, like the other attempts, this one may not \\"gain long-term traction.\\" Christina Zhao of Newsweek wrote in April 2019 that Spygate was a term that Trump \\"apparently coined to refer to allegations that the FBI had spied on his\\" 2016 presidential campaign. Zhao also noted that Attorney General William Barr had also discussed the claims while testifying to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. Zachary Basu of Axios wrote in April 2019 that the uncorroborated and \\"so-called 'spygate' scandal ... relates to alleged FISA abuses by the intelligence community\\", and \\"has been frequently promoted by defenders of President Trump\\".

Piotroski is an American professor of accounting at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and a Senior Fellow at the Asian Bureau of Finance and Economic Research (ABFER). Professor Piotroski was the inaugural Center for Global Business and the Economy Research Fellow at the Stanford GSB. Prior to joining the faculty at Stanford in 2007, Professor Piotroski was an associate professor of accounting at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (1999‚Äì2007). Stanford University Graduate School of Business ‚Äì Faculty Profiles ‚Äì Joseph D Piotroski Professor Piotroski specializes in accounting and financial reporting issues, and is known in the investing world for an influential 2000 paper he wrote while at the University of Chicago, entitled Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers. In the piece, Piotroski laid out a way (Piotroski F-score) to buy and short stocks using several accounting-based criteria. His back-testing showed that the method would have produced returns well above the broader market averages over a two- decade period. Professor Piotroski is a member of the Editorial Advisory Boards of The Accounting Review, the Journal of Accounting Research, and the Journal of Accounting and Economics. His research has been cited in publications such as Bloomberg BusinessWeek, SmartMoney Magazine, and Investor's Business Daily. Education and early career Piotroski earned a B.S. in accounting from the University of Illinois in 1989. He became a certified public accountant in the state of Illinois that same year. From 1989 to 1992, he was a senior tax associate at Coopers & Lybrand. Piotroski earned an M.B.A. in finance from Indiana University in 1994 and earned his Ph.D. in accounting from the University of Michigan in 1999. In 2000, his dissertation won the American Accounting Association Best Dissertation Award, Financial Reporting Section. Value investing research Piotroski received widespread publicity within the investment community for his 2000 paper, Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers, which appeared in the Journal of Accounting Research (Vol. 38, Supplement: Studies on Accounting Information and the Economics of the Firm). The paper examined whether a simple accounting-based fundamental analysis stock selection strategy, when applied to a broad portfolio of high book-to-market firms, could impact returns for investors. He began by limiting his search to firms whose book/market ratios (the inverse of the price/book ratio) were in the top 20% of the market. He then ran those firms through an array of tests involving their balance sheets and income statements, using such metrics as the return on assets rate, current ratio, change in gross margin, and change in asset turnover. The Piotroski F-score is a 9-point valuation metric derived on this research. Through back-testing, Piotroski found that buying the top stocks in the market according to his methodology and shorting those that got the worst scores would have resulted in 23% annualized gains from 1976 through 1996, more than double the S&P; 500 broad market index return. His findings were made available to a wider audience via SmartMoney magazine and Bloomberg BusinessWeek.

History Leigh's railway station was on the Tyldesley Loopline which was opened on 1 September 1864 by the London & North Western Railway. The station was named Bedford Leigh when it opened for passengers in 1864 and its name was changed to Leigh & Bedford in 1876 before becoming Leigh in 1914. Post grouping the station became part of London Midland and Scottish Railway. The station closed on 5 May 1969 leaving the town without a passenger railway (Westleigh railway station, the town's other station had closed in 1954). Coal deposits were the chief motivation for building a railway in the area and the railway's supporters included many local colliery owners and industrialists. In 1874 John Speakman sank Bedford Colliery to the north east of the station. The colliery railway was linked to the main line at Speakman's Sidings between Bedford Leigh and Tyldesley stations in 1882. In 1870 the station was used by 46,906 passengers and five years later passenger numbers had increased to 75,223. In 1894 more than 228,500 passengers were using the station. Location Leigh station was on the Tyldesley Loopline which ran from Eccles via Tyldesley, Bedford Leigh and Bradshaw Leach (later renamed Pennington) to Kenyon Junction. When built the station was in the Atherton township because of the alignment of the ancient boundaries. In boundary changes made in 1894, this part of the Atherton township was added to Leigh Urban District. The station was built opposite the junction of East Bond Street and Princess Street to the east of Leigh town centre. The town was also served by stations at Westleigh and Atherleigh on the Bolton and Leigh line and at Pennington. Structure The station as originally constructed consisted of two platforms, one each side of the double-track line on Leigh viaduct, a 350 yard long structure of 22 arches that carried the railway over the eastern side of Leigh town centre and the Bridgewater Canal. The station was of timber construction with a booking office under one of the viaduct's arches. The platforms were reached from separate staircases of 43 steps and each platform, also of timber construction, had an open waiting shelter. A crossover was located to the east of the station to facilitate changing lines for trains that terminated at Leigh. In 1875 a \\"Gentlemen's\\" waiting room was provided and a general waiting room was built next to the \\"Ladies\\" waiting room on the Manchester platform. Work costing ¬£17,000 to rebuild the station began in March 1896 and was expected to be finished in summer 1897 but the station was not officially reopened until 1 April 1898. The booking and parcels offices were built at the top of a new approach road on a slope up from the junction of Princess Street and East Bond Street. From the booking office at the top of the slope, covered walkway ramps accessed the platforms which were widened and provided with an ironwork canopy over both platforms and four waiting rooms on each side. Space for the structures was created by smaller arches built either side of the railway running lines. The goods yard and two sheds were located at a lower level to the north, between the station and Brown Street North. In 1904 the goods yard had a full range of facilities and was able to accommodate \\"Furniture Vans, Carriages, Portable Engines, and Machines on Wheels; Livestock; Horse Boxes and Prize Cattle Vans; and Carriages by Passenger Train\\" as well as the normal goods and parcels. Services On opening the passenger timetable allowed for direct travel from Bedford Leigh to Manchester on eight trains on weekdays, six to Liverpool, two to Kenyon and one to Warrington, with a connection to Chester. The timetable for 1934 shows Leigh having 23 direct weekday services to Manchester, 11 to Liverpool, 4 to Tyldesley, 4 to Wigan via Pennington Junction and 1 to Warrington. In 1947 there were five weekday trains direct to Manchester and three services requiring a change at Tyldesley and one other service to Tyldesley. In the opposite direction there were five trains to Kenyon Junction to change for trains for Liverpool. On Sundays there were four trains direct from Leigh to Liverpool. Services to Wigan via Pennington Junction stopped in 1942. By the 1960s services had been rationalised and most services through Leigh were on the Manchester to Liverpool service. In 1967 14 trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Exchange stopped at Leigh and three peak local trains operated between Leigh and Manchester Exchange. Additional services were run during the annual holiday wakes weeks, usually the first two weeks of July. In 1958 it was possible to take a train to several stations on the North Wales coast, Blackpool, Bristol, Devon, Cornwall, Fleetwood (for the Isle of Man ferry), Holyhead (for the Dublin ferry), London Euston, Lancaster and Morecambe.

History=French Revolution Period caricature, after the decree of 16 February 1790, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom In 1793, a French diplomat in Rome, Nicolas Jean Hugon de Bassville, indulged in a provocative display of the tricolour, symbol of French anti-clerical republicanism. A Roman crowd attacked him and he died the next day. Four years later, when Napoleon reached as far south as Ancona in an advance on Rome, this incident remained a specific grievance for which France held the pope responsible - demanding and receiving 300,000 livres as compensation for Basseville's family. Napoleonic Italy In 1797 French Republican troops under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy, defeated the papal troops and occupied Ancona and Loreto. Pius VI sued for peace. The price of persuading the French intruder to head north again, agreed in the Treaty of Tolentino, was a massive indemnity, the removal of many works of art from the Vatican collections and the surrender to France of Bologna, Ferrara and the Romagna. However, on 28 December of that year, a popular French general was killed in a riot outside the French embassy in Rome, thus providing a new pretext furnished for invasion by the French. French army units marched to Rome, entered it unopposed on and, proclaiming a Roman Republic, demanded of the Pope the renunciation of his temporal authority. Upon his refusal to do so, Pius VI was taken prisoner, and on February 20 was ultimately brought to the citadel of Valence in France where he died. The new pope, Pope Pius VII, was at first conciliatory towards Napoleon. He negotiated the French Concordat of 1801 which reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church as the major religion of France and restored some of its civil status, removing it from the authority of the Pope. While the Concordat restored some ties between France and the papacy, the agreement was slanted largely in favor of the state; the balance of church-state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon Bonaparte's favor. In 1804, Pius VII traveled to Paris to officiate at Napoleon's imperial coronation. On December 2, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Paris, in the presence of Pope Pius VII. Claims that he seized the crown out of the hands of Pope Pius VII during the ceremony in order to avoid subjecting himself to the authority of the pontiff are apocryphal; in fact, the coronation procedure had been agreed upon in advance. But by 1808 relations had deteriorated. The pope annoyed Napoleon by refusing to sanction the annulment of his brother Jerome's marriage and, perhaps more significantly, by not bringing the ports of the papal states into the Continental System. French-occupied Rome The result was that a French army occupied Rome in February 1808. In the following month another section of the papal states (the Marches) was annexed to the Napoleonic kingdom of Italy. Napoleon followed up these affronts by annexing in 1809 all that remains of the papal states, including the city of Rome, and by announcing that the pope no longer has any form of temporal authority. Pius VII responded by an immediate use of his spiritual authority, excommunicating Napoleon himself and everyone else connected with this outrage. Pius VII was immediately arrested and removed to imprisonment in France. These are the events which brought the entire Italian peninsula under French control by 1809. The situation remained unchanged until after Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig in 1813 ‚Äì an event followed by Austrian recovery of much of Italy and a subsequent seal of approval at the congress of Vienna. Roman Republic During the reigns of Pope Leo XII (1823‚Äì9) and Pope Gregory XVI (1831‚Äì46), Rome became strongly identified with the anti-liberal sentiments of most of the ruling European houses of the day. The election of Pope Pius IX in 1846 seemed to promise a less reactionary papacy. However, in 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a Roman Republic was declared and the Pope fled the city. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, recently elected president of the newly declared French Second Republic, saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting, Pius was returned to Rome by a victorious French army, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. Even before the Franco-Prussian War, Pius IX had foreseen the temporal power of the Church draining away and had begun redefining the Catholic Church as a spiritual power that would serve as a firm bulwark against the liberal trends of the period. Theology The First Vatican Council established clear theoretical underpinnings to Pius IX's commitment to an intensified centralization of ecclesiastical government in Rome. The council's companion definition of papal infallibility strengthened the energetic exercise of the papal magisterial power that was so marked a feature of the years between the first and second Vatican Councils. The pope's primary purpose was to obtain confirmation of the position he had taken in his Syllabus of Errors (1864), condemning a wide range of positions associated with rationalism, liberalism, and materialism, and to define the doctrine concerning the church. In the three sessions, there was discussion and approval of only two constitutions: Dei Filius, the Dogmatic Constitution On The Catholic Faith and Pastor Aeternus, the First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ, dealing with the primacy and infallibility of the bishop of Rome when solemnly defining dogma. Seven months later, on 18 July 1870, the prelates assembled in St Peter's accepted an uncompromising dogma - that the pope, when speaking from his throne on a matter of faith or morals, is inspired by God and is therefore infallible. Papal infallibility was merely the most striking example of the authoritarian stance now being established. It must be said that most of the dissenting bishops had left Rome before the final vote. The direction in which Pius IX was taking the church was made very plain in a document of 1864 known simply as the Syllabus. It is a list of eighty modern errors that included such broad topics as socialism, civil marriage and secular education. The final error is the concept that 'the Roman Pontiff can and should reconcile himself to and agree with progress, liberalism and modern civilization'. References *Chadwick, Owen. 1981.

He was generally known as Horace, to distinguish him from his Uncle Horatio, after whom he was named. Early life Moule was born on 30 May 1832 at Fordington, Dorset, where his father was vicar. In 1851 he entered Trinity College, Oxford, but left without a degree; in 1854 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, but did not get a B.A. until 1867 and an M.A. in 1873. He did, however, win the Hulsean Prize in 1858. Career He spent a brief spell as an assistant master at Marlborough College, and then became a government inspector of workhouses. Personal life Moule appears to have suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his life and death were shaped by these character traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a dipsomaniac-and that he was suffering from D.T'. Death On 21 September 1873, when deeply depressed and affected by alcohol, he ended a three-hour conversation at Queens' with his brother Charles and went to bed. Minutes later Charles, writing in an adjoining room, heard what he described as a \\"trickling\\" sound and went to investigate. He found Horace covered in blood but conscious and able to utter his last words \\"Easy to die. Love to my mother\\", having slashed his throat with the razor that he kept under his pillow for that very purpose. The inquest jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, and he was buried at Fordington. Hardy Some of Hardy's poems were dedicated to Moule, and it has been suggested that several characters and scenes in his novels were inspired by him. Henry Knight in A Pair of Blue Eyes shares many of Moule's character traits.

The slow-moving storm produced over of rain in New England, causing widespread flooding of urban and low-lying areas. Winds of up to snapped trees and power lines, resulting in over 1 million homes and businesses left without electricity. The storm also caused extensive coastal flooding and beach erosion.Stubborn Storm Darkens, Floods Northeast, Fox News Channel, Accessed March 16, 2010 The nor'easter was the fifth major winter storm to impact the Mid-Atlantic and New England in the 2009‚Äì10 North American winter storm season. Synoptic conditions The winter storm that would impact the Northeastern United States evolved when an area of low pressure moved northeastward from Texas to the Great Lakes region on March 10 and 11. A secondary low pressure center developed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and drifted northward to a position south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts by March 14. The system contained abundant moisture feeds from the tropical Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Unlike the previous three winter storms that affected the region in February, there was a lack of cold air with this system and precipitation with this storm fell primarily as rain. Light to moderate rain spread north across the entire region through the day on Friday as the low pressure drifted north and slowly strengthened. With a strong fetch off the Atlantic Ocean, rainfall rates became heavy overnight Friday and through the evening of Saturday March 13th, resulting in small stream and eventually major river flooding. Meanwhile, a high pressure system anchored in the Canadian Maritimes also strengthened and a very strong pressure gradient developed between these pressure systems overnight Friday. This resulted in strong, damaging easterly winds across much of the area through the day Saturday, especially along the New Jersey coast where minor to moderate coastal flooding also occurred. The strong winds and widespread heavy rains slackened off overnight Saturday as the surface low was stationary across the Delmarva region. Showers and even a few thunderstorms continued to rotate in off of the Atlantic through the day on Sunday March 14th and continued into Monday March 15th as the low slowly moved eastward and finally out to sea by Tuesday morning March 16th. Impacts=Connecticut Winds of up to toppled trees and snapped power lines, with the heaviest damage reported in Fairfield County.

Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist in the storm's aftermath. Flooding also shut down sections of commuter rail lines heading into and out of Boston, and caused sewage to overflow from treatment plants and into Boston Harbor.Mayor: State Flooded My City, WCVB TV, Accessed March 16, 2010 New HampshireNew Jersey New Jersey was particularly hard hit with flooding and wind damage and a state of emergency was declared as a result. The strong winds which frequently gusted 50-60 mph in most areas and up to 70 mph in spots wreaked the most havoc statewide, toppling numerous trees onto roads, cars, houses, and power lines causing widespread power outages. In Middlesex County, a large tree fell on a vehicle injuring two people. Wind and rain forced the closure of parts of the New Jersey Turnpike, a near complete shutdown of the NJ Transit system, and toppled a high rise crane in Atlantic City, NJ causing dangerous debris to drop to the ground. PSE&G; reported about 459,000 customers lost power during the height of the storm on Saturday March 13th, making it the worst storm in the utility's history. On Friday morning March 19th, nearly a week after the storm, 2,200 people in the state were still without power and many folks along the Passaic river in northeastern New Jersey were still dealing with major flooding. Thousands of businesses and residents in flood prone areas across the state received damage where major flooding occurred. Officials say more than 1,300 buildings in Morris County alone were damaged because of flooding along the Passaic, Ramapo and Pompton rivers. Preliminary estimates from flooding and wind damage in New Jersey alone are in the millions of dollars. Elsewhere in the area, flooding and wind damage was not as severe, but impacts from minor river flooding and downed trees and power lines were still felt in many areas. New York The New York Metro area experienced intense conditions during the height of the storm which dropped on average 3-6\\" of rain along with wind gusts over 75 mph. The hardest hit location in the metro area was Brooklyn, NY which experienced over 6\\" of rain and wind gusts up to 85 mph.

As many as one child disappears every eight minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. In some cases, children are taken from their homes to be bought and sold in the market. In other cases, children are tricked into the hands of traffickers by being presented an opportunity for a job, when in reality, upon arrival they become enslaved. In India, there are many children trafficked for various reasons such as labor, begging, and sexual exploitation. Because of the nature of this crime; it is hard to track; and due to the poor enforcement of laws, it is difficult to prevent. Due to the nature of this crime, it is only possible to have estimates of figures regarding the issue. India is a prime area for child trafficking to occur, as many of those trafficked are from, travel through or destined to go to India. Though most of the trafficking occurs within the country, there is also a significant number of children trafficked from Nepal and Bangladesh. There are many different causes that lead to child trafficking, with the primary reasons being poverty, weak law enforcement, and a lack of good quality public education. The traffickers that take advantage of children can be from another area in India, or could even know the child personally. Children who return home after being trafficked often face shame in their communities, rather than being welcomed home., Chopra, Geeta. Child Rights in India. [Electronic Resource]: Challenges and Social Action. Springer eBooks., New Delhi: Springer India : Imprint: Springer, 2015., 2015. Causes  Some of the root causes of child trafficking in India are: poverty, a lack of education, and the need to financially support their family. The unemployment rate in India is very high with the United Nations Development Programme estimating it to be at 3.5%. In addition to this, there are not that many financial opportunities. When children are offered work, they are likely to be exploited. Children in poverty are often forced to trade sex for a place to live or food to eat. In order to get out of poverty or to pay off debts, some parents have even been forced to sell their children to traffickers. Children are often trafficked by gangs and forced to beg on the streets.  Education  A lack of access to quality education and low literacy levels and rates increase child trafficking rates in India.The challenge of limited access to education impacts all of the people involved to worsen the consequences. For the child, a lack of access to education limits their future opportunities. It can also be linked to feelings of increased vulnerability, low self-esteem, and a lack of knowledge about their rights. The absence of an effective public education system, and a lack of financial security make finding employment in unskilled labour sectors (such as construction and domestic help) much more appealing to children rather than pursuing an education. A lack of good, affordable educational opportunities and financial security can lead to a devaluing of education from the parents' perspectives. This is especially true for girl children. When weighing the costs of educating a daughter against other costs to the family, a daughter's education is often foregone. Since the financial benefits of an education are only truly seen in the future, the value of an education in the present is considered to be quite low. This reasoning is supported by the lack of economic opportunities available to underprivileged and marginalised communities in India. The lack of educational opportunities is exploited by traffickers who often sell parents and children alike on the promise of steady, high paying jobs to lure them away from their homes.  Additional causes  In addition to institutional challenges in India, traditional religious and cultural practices also pose a threat to vulnerable children. In some parts of India, for example, young girls are forced into the system of Devadasi where they're \\"forced into a lifetime of ritual sex slavery\\" and given to an elder of the village to be their concubine. Child marriage is also one of the leading causes of child trafficking.Trafficking report : a compilation of research and study documents of C-BAT project.

Dhaka: Concern Universal-Bangladesh. 2009. pp. 32‚Äì34. . OCLC 495597346. A lot of children have also been trafficked due to the demand by tourists. People will travel from countries where there are strict enforcements around child trafficking, as well as it being heavily frowned upon and socially unaccepted, to India to find child prostitutes. Forms  The different forms of child trafficking include, but are not limited to: involuntary domestic servitude, forced child labor, illegal activities, child soldiers, and children exploited for commercial sex. Involuntary Domestic Servitude Children are very vulnerable when it comes to domestic servitude. Often children are told that they will be offered excellent wages to work as a domestic helper in middle- class homes, but they usually end up being severely underpaid, abused, and sometimes sexually assaulted. This particular type of trafficking is hard to detect because it takes place inside private homes where there is no public enforcement. Every year hundreds of thousands of girls are trafficked from rural India to work as domestic helpers in the urban areas. Forced Child Labor Legally, children in India are allowed to do light work, but they are often trafficked for bonded labour and domestic work, and are worked far beyond what is allowed in the country. Children are also forced to work as bonded labourers in brick and stone quarries to pay off family debts owed to moneylenders and employers. They are often forced to work in the use of contraptions that bound them to be unable to escape and then forced to submit to control. Others may be bound by abuse whether physical, emotional, or sexual. Children from India's rural areas migrate or are trafficked for employment in industries, such as spinning mills, cottonseed production, manual work, domestic work in family homes, stone quarrying, brick kilns and tea gardens amongst others, where they are forced to work in hazardous environments for little or no pay.https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/images/ilab/child-labor/India.pdf Those forced into labor lose all freedom, being thrown into the workforce, essentially becoming slaves, and losing their childhood. Illegal activities Children, over adults are often chosen to be trafficked for illegal activities such as begging and organ trade, as they are seen as more vulnerable. Not only are these children being forced to beg for money, but a significant number of those on the streets have had limbs forcibly amputated, or even acid poured into their eyes to blind them by gang masters. Those who are injured tend to make more money, which is why they are often abused in this way.Child beggars in India Organ trade is also common, when traffickers trick or force children to give up an organ. UNICEF estimates that more than 300,000 children under 18 are currently being exploited in more than 30 armed conflicts worldwide. While the majority of child soldiers are between the ages of 15 and 18, some are as young as 7 or 8 years of age.https://www.unicef.org/protection/armedconflict.html A large number of children are abducted to use as soldiers. Others are used to serve as porters, cooks, guards, servants, messengers, or spies. Many of these young soldiers are sexually abused which often ends with unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Some children have been forced to commit atrocities against their families and communities. Reports indicate that children were coerced by anti government naxalites to join children's units (‚ÄúBal Dasta‚Äù), where they were trained and used as couriers and informants, to plant improvised explosive devices and in front-line operations against national security forces. Children Exploited for Commercial Sex Sexual exploitation is an issue that faces many developing and developed countries. The United States of America has the largest trade in child porn in the world, and is defined as ‚Äúthe sexual abuse of children and youth through the exchange of sex or sexual acts for drugs, food, shelter, protection, other basics of life, and/or money‚Äù. Children that are exploited for commercial sex are subject to transactions for child pornography and child prostitution. The Commercial Sexual Exploitation (CSE) of women and children generates approximately 400 million US Dollars annually in the city of Mumbai alone.http://www.ijmindia.org/files/library/CSES%20Study%20Report%20Rev%20%28Final%20Prevalence%20Study%29.pdf Although it is hard to find accurate numbers for exactly how many children are trafficked, studies and surveys sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) estimates that there are about three million prostitutes in the country, of which an estimated 40 percent are children, as there is a growing demand for very young girls to be inducted into prostitution on account of customer preferences. There are many severehttps://www.unicef.org/worldfitforchildren/files/India_WFFC5_Report.pdf consequences these children face from being sexually exploited. Prevalence Child trafficking is an issue that is extremely prevalent in India, and is continuing to grow rapidly. The trafficking of young girls (under the age of 18) has grown 14 times over the last decade and has grown by 65% in the year 2014 according to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). There have been numerous reports about the increase of trafficking taking place across India. According to the US State Department, there are approximately 600,000 to 820,000 people trafficked a year across international borders, and up to 50% of those are children. This is definitely seen as a growing issue in Asia, with the many children that are and continue to be trafficked and exploited for many reasons. In India specifically, it is estimated that there are around 135,000 children trafficked each year. In 2005, a study was conducted by the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) after they received an alarming number of reports from the press, police, and non-government organisations (NGOs) about the rise of human trafficking within India. They found that India was fast becoming a source, transit point and destination for traffickers of women and children for sexual and non-sexual purposes. This finding has only increased since being recognised in 2005, and is becoming a very large problem. Almost 20,000 children and women were subjected to human trafficking in 2016. This is nearly a 25% rise from 2015. The areas of the greatest concern were poverty stricken areas such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa and West Bengal.IANS. India hub of child trafficking in South Asia. (19-08-2009) The state within India which has the most child trafficking is Assam, holding 38% of the nation's cases. While the issue of child trafficking is higher in some specific parts of India, it is a widespread problem all over the nation. It is difficult to find exact numbers on the issue of child trafficking due to the fact that it is illegal, so the process is very secretive. From the information that is known, there is a very clear increase, not only over the past decade, but also from year to year. This is extremely concerning and the data seems to point to the assumption that it will continue to rise. Figures in India * In 1998, between 5,000 and 7,000 Nepalese girls, some barely 9‚Äì10 years old were trafficked into the red light districts in Indian cities. More than 250,000 Nepalese women and girls were already in Indian brothels at the time. * According to UNICEF, 12.6 million children are engaged in hazardous occupations. * In 2009, it was estimated that 1.2 million children were trafficked worldwide for sexual exploitation, including for prostitution or the production of sexually abusive images. * Only 10% of human trafficking in India is international, while 90% is interstate. * According to a report by the National Human Rights Commission of India, 40,000 children are abducted each year, leaving 11,000 untraced. * NGO's estimate that between 12,000 and 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the country annually from neighbouring nations as a part of the sex trade. * There are an estimated 300,000 child beggars in India. * Every year, 44,000 children fall into the clutches of gangs. * In 2015, only 4,203 human trafficking cases were investigated in India. * In 2014, 76% of all people trafficked in India were women and girls. * Children make up roughly 40% of prostitutes. * It is estimated that over 2 million women and children are trafficked for sex into the red-light districts in India. * The Indian Government estimates that girls make up the majority of children in sex trafficking. * According to the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) reports from 2009, there are an estimated 1.2 million children involved in prostitution in India. Actions against trafficking Action against child trafficking in India is being taken at many levels. The central government's response can be seen at a policy level in terms of the schemes they provide, and at a legal level in the form of acts and amendments they pass. State governments have also been noted to take action to address child trafficking by making an effort to implement schemes and laws at the state-level. Any gaps in the implementation of schemes and laws are largely filled in by non-governmental organisations that work to address different aspects of this issue.  Indian government's response  India is viewed as a hub for human trafficking, however the issue is of low priority for Indian Government. The Immoral Traffic Prevention Act was first amended in 1956. The act was created to prevent trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and children but the Act does not provide a clear definition of \\"'trafficking'\\".In 2003, India enforced the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which includes three protocols, specifically the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. The protocol \\"provides an agreed upon definition of trafficking in persons. It aims at comprehensively addressing trafficking in persons through the so-called three P's - Prosecution of perpetrators, Protection of victims and Prevention of trafficking.\\" The protocol defines trafficking as \\"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or service, slavery or practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organ.\\"  Legal response to child trafficking  On the international stage, intergovernmental organisations, like the United Nations, have been introducing measures to address child trafficking since the early 1900s with varying degrees of success. Some of their more notable measures include the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the United Nations, and the adoption of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children in 2000.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 87-94. . On a national level, Article 23 of the Constitution of India explicitly bans human trafficking.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 101-102. . The Government of India has also passed other acts and amended the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to address the challenge of child trafficking.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 101-110. . The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1986 (ITPA) is an amended version of The Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA). SITA made human trafficking for prostitution illegal and outlined legal action against people involved in human trafficking in any capacity.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 104-105. . ITPA made laws friendlier towards the victim. ITPA also created a system to rehabilitate victims of trafficking and prevent them from bring trafficked again.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 104\\\\. . In 2013, the IPC was amended to create new provisions to address human trafficking in India that are more in line with the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children.Ahmad, Afkar (2018). Woman and Child Trafficking in India. New Delhi: SSDN Publishers and Distributors. p. 109\\\\. .  Critical reframing  The way in which the current legal system operates to address child trafficking in India can be considered to be coming into direct conflict with the trend of independent child migration that is seen across the country.Romano, C.R. (2014). Independent Child Migration in the Developing World: Victims of trafficking and child labor, or autonomous economic actors? Case Studies‚ÄîTogo and India (Honours Thesis). Retrieved from https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/8601/Maria%20Cecilia%20Romano-%20Final%20-%20CA.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Scholars raise the argument that at times child welfare laws and anti child trafficking laws can put independent child migrants at risk. The current laws make it difficult for children seeking employment in their hometowns, because there are limited opportunities. Children between the ages of 14 and 18 are also not allowed to work in a number of industries that are considered hazardous. Children above the age of 14 are not required by law to remain in school adding to this underage labour force. Such a situation often pushes children to seek employment in informal sectors, such as the service and handicraft industries, which more often than not also require them to migrate to urban centres. Children migrating with non-family adults for work often get mistaken for victims of child trafficking, since the current laws do not account for the possibility of independent child migrants. These children are usually forced to remain in shelters or are returned to their homes. The adults involved are accused of being traffickers and face legal action. Scholars argue that this limitation in the legal system may put independent child migrants at risk who are forced to depend on trafficking agents for passage to cities or are forced to make the dangerous journey on their own as a result. Although there are no clear responses to this challenge yet, scholars have proposed certain possible solutions such as changing the education system to include skills training, creating employment opportunities for rural populations, and better training for law enforcement officials working to address child trafficking.

This First Nation is part of the Cree ethno-linguistic group, is a member of the Yellowhead Tribal Council (a regional grouping of several bands), and is party to Treaty 6. The band controls three Indian reserves: Alexander 134, Alexander 134A, and Alexander 134B. The main reserve is bordered by Sturgeon County and Lac Ste. Anne County.  Population  , Alexander First Nation had 2,263 official members, and an on-reserve population of 1,057. As of March 2017, the First Nation had 2,500 band members. At the time, the population on the reserve was growing at a rate 2.5 times that of the non-First Nations populations in the area. In 1998, the Nation had 1,343 official members.  Lands  In the reserve land provision of Treaty 6, which was signed in 1877, the Alexander First Nation was promised 128 acres per citizen in a land entitlement agreement. Census issues later resulted in a shortfall of land, and a claim was accepted by Canada in 1992 after First Nation research demonstrated the shortfall. At a formal ceremony in October 1998 at the Alexander First Nation Community Hall, the government of Canada, the government of Alberta, and the Alexander First Nation announced the fulfillment of Treaty 6. Alexander First Nation was given an additional of reserve land and $10 million was put into a trust to be used \\"solely for the purchase of land and the long-term benefit and use of Alexander and its members.\\" The Alexander First Nation operates three reservations: *Alexander 134 *Alexander 134A *Alexander 134B  Government =Chiefs List of historic chiefs: *Alexander Arcand (1877‚Äì1914) *Edward Arcand (1914‚Äì1936) *Emile Burnstick (1936‚Äì1937) *Alexis Arcand (1937‚Äì1950) *Adam Auigbelle (1950‚Äì1955) *John Gladue (1955‚Äì1959) *Fred Arcand (1959‚Äì1961) *Sr. Henry Paul (1961‚Äì1963) *James Arcand (1963‚Äì1965) *Peter Lafleche (Aug.1965‚ÄìOct.1965) *Henry Paul (1965‚Äì1969) *Alex Auigbelle (1969‚Äì1971) *George Lafleche (1971‚Äì1973) *Fred Arcand Sr. (1973‚Äì1976 *James Arcand (February 1977‚ÄìSeptember 1977) *Leo Bruno (1977‚Äì1979) *Stanley Arcand (1979‚Äì1986) *Allan Paul (1986‚Äì1990) *Stanley Arcand (1990‚Äì1999) *Victoria Arcand (1999‚Äì2005) *Raymand Arcand (2005‚Äì2008) *Allan Paul (2008‚Äì2011) *Herbert Arcand (2011‚Äì2014) *Kurt Burnstick (2014‚ÄìAugust 2017) *no chief (August 2017‚ÄìOctober 2017) *Kurt Burnstick (October 2017‚ÄìAugust 2020) *George Arcand (Jr) (September 2020-Present)  Elections  In 2011, voter eligibility rules at the First Nation were challenged as discriminatory, as First Nation members not living on the reservation were not allowed to vote. The results of a 13 July 2017 election saw Burnstick re-elected, with those results overturned the following month by an appeal board that ruled that \\"a regulation requiring the unanimous consent of chief and council for an early election call had been violated.\\" After the quashed election results, there was no elected council in place as of 31 August 2017. In September 2017, there was a court application to delay an upcoming election, with the intent of changing rules so off-reserve band members could vote. On 30 September 2017, a judge rejected the application, allowing the election to proceed. In October 2017, Kurt Burnstick was re- elected as chief, winning 171 of 470 ballots cast. Opponent Armand Arcand received 167 votes, and Stanley Arcand Junior received 128. The result proved controversial, with a group arguing that rules forbidding off-reserve members from voting as discriminatory. At the time, around half of the 2,223 members of the First Nation lived off the reserve.  Social policy  The nation's stated mission is \\"To protect our Inherent Treaty Rights through tactical initiatives, community enhancement, law development and continuous improvement.\\" Resources and support for the community are regulated by Alexander First Nation Social Development. The Wapski Mahikan Society was provided to support children and families \\"within the society's jurisdiction.\\" In March 2019, the Alexander First Nation in Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding with the child services department of Alberta, to give the nation more say in \\"how their children are cared for.\\"  Economy and finances  In September 2016, CBC News reported that some residents on the reserve had been waiting on power poles and running water for six years, with three prior chiefs and councils saying there was no funds to extend power lines. After \\"over 30 years\\" of concern over financial irregularities by community members, on 10 March 2016, band councillors voted to appoint the accounting firm Meyers Norris Penny to audit the employment activities of past and present elected officials and staff. The audit, performed at the request of then Chief Kurt Burnstick, scrutinized activities from 2013 until 2015, with findings presented to the band council on 4 August 2016. Meyers Norris Penny found $2.1 million in \\"unexplained payments\\" made to a former chief and administrative staff, and the document, which leaked to CBC, said that \\"about half of the unexplained amounts, totalling more than $1 million, were paid to former chief Herbert Arcand and current tribal chief administrator Alphonse Arcand,\\" with other funds earmarked for personal vacations and casinos. Arcand and Arcand disputed the findings, calling the report incomplete and one-sided. According to CBC, their coverage of the audit in September 2016 had \\"prompted band members with similar complaints from other reserves to speak out across the country\\" by January 2017. As a result of the report, it was reported that some members of the nation were \\"asking for help from the police and the courts,\\" and in August 2016, a criminal complaint was made to the RCMP. In January 2017, three band members sued their former chief, a current councillor and an administrator, in the Court of Queen's Bench in Edmonton on 21 December 2016. The suit cited the $2 million in unexplained payments to Alphonse Arcand, Allan Paul, and former chief Herbert Arcand, alleging \\"illegal and improper acts\\" and \\"unlawful abuse\\" of positions. In July 2017, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada reported that $5.3 million in band payments at Alexander lacked sufficient documentation, between April 2010 and March 2016. The audit, performed by Ernst & Young, calculated $2.5 million of those funds coming from INA, with large unsupported funds going to Burnstick and Alphonse Arnand. At the band's request, on 11 September 2017, the Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs in Ottawa asserted that a \\"third-party co-manager\\" was \\"working to sort out\\" finances at Alexander First Nation.  Pipeline negotiations  Prior to 2013, Pembina Pipeline began negotiating with the First Nation as to placing a nearby pipeline, with the community supportive. Burnstick was elected chief in mid-2013, and according to Pembina, began engaging in talks over benefits with the company without the knowledge of the First Nation. After a three-year regulatory and legal battle with Burnstick, Pembina decided to cease negotiations and build around the reserve. In March 2017, members of the Alexander First Nation accused chief Burnstick of costing the community jobs and revenue with the failed negotiations.  Assault trials  As of September 2016, Kurt Burnstick was being pressured to resign as chief after facing three sexual assault charges concerning incidents from 2015 and 1985. The community group Alexander Women Warriors pushed for Burnstick to step down, as did dozens of people a rally in September 2016. Burnstick refused and imposed what the Edmonton Journal described as a \\"total media blackout\\". In January 2017, a trial was held following sexual-assault allegations against Burnstick. The judge said there was not enough evidence to convict, and Burnstick was acquitted of the first charge on 10 January 2017. He was acquitted of the other two charged in October 2018, after a judge was left with reasonable doubt.

This airport was named after the regional writer Jo√£o Sim√µes Lopes Neto (1865 ‚Äî 1916) and it is operated by Infraero. History On June 22, 1927 the city of Pelotas received the first official commercial passenger flight operated by the first Brazilian airline, Varig, founded only a month earlier. The flight Porto Alegre/Pelotas/Rio Grande, operated by an amphibian Dornier Wal, used Pelotas River for landing and take-off operations. However, as early as 1930 a small terminal was built by a grass strip on the site where today is the airport. In 1935 the airport with all the necessary amenities was officially inaugurated and continues in operation ever since. In 1997 the whole airport complex was extensively renovated and a new terminal was opened in 1998. In 2001 it was upgraded to international status. Pelotas is commonly used by the Brazilian Air Force as the last stop in Brazil on its flights to the Brazilian Antarctic Base. Airlines and destinations No scheduled flights operate at this airport. Accidents and incidents *11 January 1949: a SAVAG Lockheed Model 18-10-01 Lodestar registration PP-SAC flying from Pelotas to Porto Alegre crashed just after take-off from Pelotas killing all 8 occupants.

This runic inscription, designated as U 448 in the Rundata catalog, is on a Viking Age memorial runestone located in Harg, which is about 4 kilometers north of M√§rsta, Stockholm County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of Uppland. Description The design of this inscription consists of runic text inscribed within a serpent band which circles the stylized figures of a man on a horse and of a bird. The stone is composed of granite and is 1.9 meters in height. The inscription is tentatively classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads on Pr3 inscriptions are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. Based on stylistic analysis, the inscription has been attributed to the Swedish runemaster Fot,Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for U 448. who was active in Sweden in the mid-eleventh century. Fot was noted for the consistency of his use of the punctuation mark √ó between the words in the runic inscription, pp. 81‚Äì82. which is evident in the runic text of this inscription. The runic text states that the stone was raised by √çgull and Bj«´rn as a memorial to their father √ûorsteinn. The name √ûorsteinn contains as a theophoric name element the Norse pagan god Thor, and means \\"Thor's Stone.\\" One word of the runic text, sinn, has been implied based upon similar inscriptions on memorial stones for a portion of the text that was damaged and lost. The inscription includes a depiction of a bird and a figure on a horse. The bird in the upper center of the inscription has been identified, due to its tail, as possibly being a peacock, which in the early Catholic Church was used as a symbol of rebirth and resurrection. pp. 127-128. Alternatively, the bird may also be a forest bird such as a black grouse or capercaillie.

He deposed all three and installed his own preferred candidate: Pope Clement II. The history of the papacy from 1048 to 1257 was marked by conflict between popes and the Holy Roman Emperor, most prominently the Investiture Controversy, a dispute over who-- pope or emperor-- could appoint bishops within the Empire. Henry IV's Walk to Canossa in 1077 to meet Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì85), although not dispositive within the context of the larger dispute, has become legendary. Although the emperor renounced any right to lay investiture in the Concordat of Worms (1122), the issue would flare up again. The Imperial crown once held by the Carolingian emperors was disputed between their fractured heirs and local overlords; none emerged victorious until Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor invaded Italy. Italy became a constituent kingdom of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, from which point emperors were Germanic. As emperors consolidated their position, northern Italian city-states would become divided by Guelphs and Ghibellines. Long-standing divisions between East and West also came to a head in the East-West Schism and the Crusades. The first seven Ecumenical Councils had been attended by both Western and Eastern prelates, but growing doctrinal, theological, linguistic, political, and geographic differences finally resulted in mutually denunciations and excommunications. Pope Urban II (1088‚Äì99) speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095 became the rallying cry of the First Crusade. Unlike the previous millennium, the process for papal selection became somewhat fixed during this period. Pope Nicholas II promulgated In Nomine Domini in 1059, which limited suffrage in papal elections to the College of Cardinals. The rules and procedures of papal elections evolved during this period, laying the groundwork for the modern papal conclave. The driving force behind these reforms was Cardinal Hildebrand, who later became Gregory VII. History=Investiture Controversy The Investiture Controversy was the most significant conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, and the Gregorian Papacy concerning who would control appointments of church officials (investiture). The controversy, undercutting the Imperial power established by the Salian Emperors, would eventually lead to nearly fifty years of civil war in Germany, the triumph of the great dukes and abbots, and the disintegration of the German empire, a condition from which it would not recover until the unification of Germany in the 19th century. In 1046, Henry III deposed three rival popes. Over the next ten years, he personally selected four of the next five pontiffs. But after the death of Henry III, the pope quickly moved to change the system to prevent such secular involvement in the election of future popes. The eleventh century is often called the century of Saxon popes: Pope Gregory VI (1045‚Äì1046), Pope Clement II (1046‚Äì1047), Pope Damasus II (1048), Pope Leo IX (1049‚Äì1054), Pope Victor II (1055‚Äì1057) and Pope Stephen IX (1057‚Äì1058). Three popes Benedict IX, Sylvester III and Gregory VI all claimed to be the rightful pope. Henry III deposed all three and held a synod where he declared no Roman priest fit for the title of pope. He subsequently appointed Suidger of Bamberg who, after being duly acclaimed by the people and clergy, took the name Clement II. Days later, Clement II then crowned Henry emperor. Over the next ten years, Henry personally selected four of the next five pontiffs. The ascendancy of these to the papacy reflected the strength and power of the Holy Roman Emperor. However, Henry was the last emperor to dominate the papacy in this way because, after his death, the pope quickly moved to change the system to prevent such secular involvement in the election of future popes. The struggle between the temporal power of the emperors and the spiritual influence of the popes came to a head in the reigns of Pope Nicholas II (1059‚Äì1061) and Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085). The popes fought to free the appointment of bishops, abbots and other prelates from the power of secular lords and monarchs into which it had fallen. This would prevent venial men being appointed to vital church positions because it benefited political rulers. Henry IV was ultimately driven by a revolt among the German nobles to make peace with the pope and appeared before Gregory in January 1077 at Canossa. Dressed as a penitent, the emperor is said to have stood barefoot in the snow for three days and begged forgiveness until, in Gregory's words: \\"We loosed the chain of the anathema and at length received him into the favor of communion and into the lap of the Holy Mother Church\\".Robinson 2004: 283 Electoral reform San Pietro in Vincoli, the site of the papal election, 1061, the first to exclude the laity Pope Nicholas II, elected in 1058, initiated a process of reform which exposed the underlying tension between empire and papacy. In 1059, at a synod in Rome, Nicholas condemned various abuses within the church, and issued In Nomine Domini. These included simony (the selling of clerical posts), the marriage of clergy and, more controversially, corrupt practices in papal elections. Nicholas then restricted the choice of a new pope to a conclave of cardinals, thus ruling out any direct influence by secular powers. The primary objective of these actions was to restrict the influence of the Holy Roman Emperor on papal elections. In 1061, the assembled bishops of Germany, the emperor's own faction, declared all the decrees of this pope null and void. In 1059, Nicholas II took two steps of a kind which, while unusual at this period, would later become commonplace for the medieval papacy. He granted land, which was already occupied, to recipients of his own choice, engaging those recipients in a feudal relationship with the papacy, or the Holy See, as the feudal lord. The beneficiaries of Nicholas' land grants were the Normans, who were granted territorial rights in southern Italy and Sicily in return for feudal obligations to Rome. These tensions between emperors and pontiffs were to continue into the twelfth century and ultimately gave rise to the \\"distinctive separation of Church and State when the emperor signed the Concordat of Worms (1122) forfeiting any right to invest bishops with the ring and the staff symbolic of spiritual authority\\".Ozment, 1980: 4 Papal victory was short-lived, and this attempted separation of the secular from the ecclesiastical did not end aspirations on the part of the emperors to influence the papacy, nor the aspirations of the popes to exercise political power. During the reign of Pope Gregory VII, the title ‚Äúpope‚Äù was officially restricted to the bishop of Rome. Gregory VII was also responsible for greatly expanding the power of the papacy in worldly matters. One of the great reforming popes, Gregory is perhaps best known for the part he played in the Investiture Controversy, which pitted him against Emperor Henry IV, and the Gregorian Reform process. East-West Schism The East-West Schism was the event that divided Chalcedonian Christianity into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between the two Churches. The primary causes of the Schism were disputes over papal authority-- the pope claimed he held authority over the four Eastern Greek- speaking patriarchs, and over the insertion of the filioque clause into the Nicene Creed by the Western Church. Eastern Orthodox today claim that the primacy of the Patriarch of Rome was the only honorary and that he has authority only over his own diocese and does not have the authority to change the decisions of Ecumenical Councils. There were other, less significant catalysts for the Schism, including variance over liturgical practices and conflicting claims of jurisdiction. The Church split along doctrinal, theological, linguistic, political, and geographic lines, and the fundamental breach has never been healed. Attempts were made to reunite the two churches in 1274 (by the Second Council of Lyon) and in 1439 (by the Council of Basel), but in each case the councils were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole, charging that the hierarchs had overstepped their authority in consenting to these so-called \\"unions\\". Further attempts to reconcile the two bodies have failed. Byzantine emperor Alexius Comnenus asked Pope Urban II (1088‚Äì1099) for help against the Turks in the early 1090s. Urban II viewed this request as a great opportunity. Not only could it restore Christian control over the Holy Land, but it also provided a means of domestic pacification that focused the aggression of the European nobility towards the Moslems instead of each other. In addition, coming to the aid of Byzantium held the possibility of a reunion between the eastern and western Churches after almost four decades of schism, thereby strengthening the western Church in general and the papacy in particular. On November 27, 1095, Urban II made one of the most influential speeches in the Middle Ages at the Council of Clermont combining the ideas of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels. The pope called for a ‚ÄúWar of the Cross,‚Äù or Crusade, to retake the holy lands from the unbelievers. France, the pope said, was already overcrowded and the Holy Lands of Canaan were overflowing with milk and honey. Pope Urban II asked the Frenchmen to turn their swords in favor of God's service, and the assembly replied \\"Dieu le veult!\\" - \\"God wills it!\\" See alsoNotesFurther reading *Blumenthal, Uta-Renate. 1998.

The mission of Cool the Earth is to educate kids and their families about climate change and motivate them to take simple measurable actions at home to reduce their carbon emissions. Currently, the organization offers programming to over 100 elementary schools. History Cool the Earth was founded in 2007 by Marin County parents, Carleen and Jeff Cullen, in the North San Francisco Bay Area. The couple said that they were influenced by Al Gore's documentary on climate change, An Inconvenient Truth. Surprised by what they had learned, the Cullens held screenings of the film where parents from their community could view and discuss ways to fight climate changes. Despite their efforts, the Cullens realized that people were still slow to take action. Thus, Cool the Earth was established with other parent volunteers from their community to motivate people to make more eco-friendly choices. The program was first launched at Bacich Elementary School in Kentfield, California (the school that the Cullen's children attended at the time).Cool the Earth. Cool the Earth, 2008. Web. 05 April 2010. Carleen Cullen mentioned running Cool the Earth out of her garage with 10 employees and several teachers and parent volunteers who work across the 25 North San Francisco Bay Area elementary and middle schools.Moody, Shelah (September 7, 2008). \\"Carleen Cullen fights global warming\\".

The program has catalyzed over 80,000 energy- efficiency actions. CTEI offers a school-to-home program that is not curriculum-based. Cool the Earth uses a child driven model to inspire families to conserve energy and resources. This model in which the family acts together out of concern for the dangers of global warming, has recently been cited by the first major \\"National Household Survey on Global Warming\\" as one of the most effective methods to create positive environmental change.A 2007 household survey by Porter Novelli Center for Excellence in Climate Change Communication at George Mason University of 13,000 Adults and Children found that when children and their parents agree that global warming poses a threat, and share knowledge about how they can combat it, the family engages in taking more action to reduce their carbon emissions. The program employs a method that engages all the children at school and gives them the tools to catalyze their parents so that the whole family reduces their carbon footprint. The program is built around community action. Children, parents, and teachers see that by working together, individual actions are meaningful.Reference: Elk Grove Citizen - November 24, 2009 \\"Program teaches Foulks students ways to be Green\\" : http://www.egcitizen.com/articles/2009/11/24/lifestyle Kids who participate are learning about consumption habits, and parents are becoming engaged in the climate change crisis‚Äîsimilar to how kids brought home the message of recycling and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt smoke.‚Äù The organization has established partnerships with The Bay Area Air Board, The Chabot Space & Science Center, Marin Community Foundation, Marin Conservation Corps, Strategic Energy Innovations, Marin Municipal Water District, Safe Routes to School, Al Gore‚Äôs The Climate Project.

It contains a single species, Trucidocynodon riograndensis. Fossils of Trucidocynodon were discovered in Santa Maria Formation outcrops in Paleorrota geopark Agudo. T. riograndensis was similar to Ecteninion lunensis from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto formation of Argentina, but differed in several respects, including its larger size. It is known from a nearly complete holotype skeleton as well as a referred skull. The holotype skeleton had an estimated length of 1.2 meters (4 feet), while the referred skull was 17% larger than that of the holotype. Trucidocynodon is considered one of the largest known carnivorous cynodonts from the Triassic, as well as one of the largest probainognathians in the entire Mesozoic. A biomechanical study has argued that Trucidocynodon not only had erect limbs, but that it also possibly had digitigrade forelimbs, being among the first synapsids to show adaptations for cursoriality. However, it was likely not a specialized runner, unlike ungulates and some other modern cursorial mammals.

Early history Carlo Piranio, a native of Sicily, immigrated to the U.S. circa 1901 with his brother Joseph. They first settled in Shreveport, Louisiana. Carlo began the Dallas faction of the American Mafia in 1921 with Joseph as his underboss. Carlo, later described as the \\"original head of the Mafia in Texas,\\" was born about 1876 in Corleone, Sicily, the same hometown as early New York Mafia boss Giuseppe Morello. Piranio's marriage to an eighteen- year-old woman, recently arrived from Italy, occurred in 1903. In 1904, a son, Angelo, was born to Carlo and Clementia Piranio. The Piranio relocation to Dallas, Texas, occurred sometime between the marriage and the Shreveport birth of Angelo in 1904. The April 1910 U.S. Census says the family lived temporarily at 774 Main Street in Dallas. The household included Carlo and Clementia, young Angelo, and Joseph Piranio and his new bride Lena. Carlo ran a real estate business from his home. Joseph worked as a grocery salesman. Joseph was not entirely settled in Texas. He moved back to Louisiana for a few years. He, his wife and two young daughters returned to Dallas by 1914. Carlo died of natural causes in 1930. Joseph took over the family after Carlo's death. He owned a number of bars, controlled numerous gambling operations, and ran some minor labor rackets through his construction business. Joseph Civello Joseph Civello was born in 1902, in rural West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. He was the second child born to Philip and Catherine Civello. His father, a farm laborer, had been in the United States since 1900. The Civello family grew to include seven children. The family remained in West Baton Rouge until 1923, when Philip relocated the clan to Dallas and opened a grocery store. Civello married in November 1929. He and his wife Mary moved into Philip Civello's home at 1902 Moser Avenue. Joseph worked as a salesman for his father's grocery store.Dallas Morning News, Jan 19, 1970 Death of Joe DeCarlo Law enforcement officers quickly became aware of Joseph Civello. He was convicted of Prohibition violations in 1926 and served forty days in jail. On July 12, 1928, Civello was again arrested on liquor charges. His arrest was part of a series of raids that nabbed a total of twenty-two suspected bootleggers around the city. Civello was arrested on St. Paul Street with two other men, Ernest Calchano and Joe DeCarlo. DeCarlo was an important bootlegger in the Dallas area and had recently begun refusing to send tribute payments to Carlo Piranio. Civello was selected to administer Mafia discipline. Just two days after their arrest together, Civello and DeCarlo met inside the St. Paul Drugstore at the intersection of St. Paul and Bryan Streets. Civello happened to be carrying a loaded shotgun at the time. As the men stood close to each other, the shotgun went off. DeCarlo was shot in the stomach. Rather than flee, Civello remained with the mortally wounded DeCarlo, protesting that his weapon had fired by accident. DeCarlo, with his dying breath, confirmed Civello's story. Civello was arrested and charged with murder. He continued to insist that the killing was accidental. A Dallas grand jury gave considerable weight to DeCarlo's dying statement. Within two days, Civello was released on his own recognizance. The grand jury continued its investigation into DeCarlo's death and decided on July 27 not to indict Civello. Apalachin Meeting Joseph Civello assumed control in 1956, when Joseph Piranio died at age 78. Civello attended the infamous Apalachin Meeting of Mafia leaders in 1957, a time when he controlled narcotics, gambling, prostitution and night clubs in most of Texas. After the Apalachin Meeting, the FBI began keeping closer tabs on Civello. On January 13, 1960, Civello was indicted for conspiracy and perjury offenses. Judge Irving R. Kaufman sentenced him and nineteen other mob leaders that were at Apalachin to five years in prison. Ten months later, a U.S. Appeals Court overturned the convictions of the twenty men. Prosecutors had proven conspiracy, the court decided, but had not proven that the conspiracy was designed to accomplish some unlawful act. Joseph Ianni After Civello's death in 1970, the FBI listed the Dallas Family as inactive. It is more likely, however, that longtime Dallas capo Joseph Ianni assumed leadership after Civello's death.

It was acquired by the Richard Rogers Partnership in 1983, which converted the industrial complex of redundant 20th century warehouses into offices, workshops, housing and a restaurant. History Thames Wharf Studios in April 2009 Duckham was founded by Alexander Duckham in 1899 and established a good reputation in the field of lubrication for industrial machinery and motor vehicles. By the early 1920s the Duckham range of oils was officially recommended by more than 60 British car manufacturers. Production and product research had started with 10 men at a small works in Millwall. The company moved to Hammersmith in 1921, and major expansions occurred in 1940 and 1948. Another works was established in Birmingham during World War II, and by the late 1960s Duckham had become the largest selling brand of motor oil in the country. The company was bought by BP in 1970, and the works at Thames Wharf were closed in 1979. The site was developed as architectural practice offices, lettable workshops and office units (within the refurbished warehouse blocks) and new housing. The Richard Rogers office's double-height entrance lobby has been developed as an informal gallery where project models are exhibited on steel racks. Throughout the building new elements are expressed in a bold industrial manner, often using primary colours. On the ground floor of the site is The River Caf√©, which opened in 1987. The caf√© looks out over a private landscaped area that extends to the river walkway. The two-storey rooftop extension to the office space, shaped like a 'bread bin', was designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, an architectural practice that had offices in the Thames Wharf complex but has since moved to Island Studios, 22 St Peter's Square. Completed in 1991, the extension‚Äôs great semi-circular roof provides a lightweight expression of the activities carried out below. Present day Founder partner of the Richard Rogers Partnership and RIBA past president, Marco Goldschmied sold his share of the freehold interest in 2010. The remainder of the freeholds have been owned since 2007 by two Guernsey companies and a pension fund which acquired John Young and Richard Rogers' share of the freehold interests in 2007. Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, formerly the Richard Rogers Partnership, remain as tenants, as do The River Caf√© who both have leases expiring in December 2015. In 2009 the first floor office space was let by Thames Wharf Studios's consultants, Frost Meadowcroft, to Pok√©mon the video and card game company.

It is believed that the Kharwa originated from Rajasthan and migrated to the coast during the tenth century, where they took up fishing as well, and imported and exported goods on ships. They are a royal family in Rajput .There are two castes in kharva, mainly raghuvanshi and suryavanshi. Raghuvanshi kharvas are the one who washed Lord Ram's feet before letting him sit in his boat before crossing the river . It has been said that Kharva caste comes under a Rajputana Community . In the early ages of the caste It's said that the people of Kharva caste were Landlords and Guarantors . When Mahmud Ghazni was attacking Somnath and Patan, The bravery and courage of people of Kharva Community came into highlight while fighting against Mahmud Ghazni . The people of Kharva were basically belonged to Rajasthan .The ancestors of this community entered in Kutch and Kathiyawad(Saurashtra) in the early period.Firstly, many of them entered in Mandvi and Mundra, while others entered is Jamnagar, Okha, Dwarika, Porbandar, Veraval, Mangrol, Vanakbara and Diu. After entering into the business of Ships including Import/Export of goods and fisheries they were unable to maintain the relations with other Rajputs .since then they are also known as Vahanvati's. In 1025 A.D. Mahmud Ghazni attacked Somanth. At that time 36 Kharva's lost their lives while protecting the temple . Till today we can find this in books. From that time Kharva's started living in the coastal areas. Then, they began to be known as Vahanvati's and DariyaiChorru's.They took the business of Ships including Import/Export of goods and fisheries. The people of the community got together and made a small meeting to make an organisation for the Justice in their community. Porbandar Samast Kharva Gnati was made in Vikram Samvat 1814. The Kharva then started to built their own Ships and sailed across many countries for trade . Due to that they are known as Vahanvati's in the Hindu Community. Sailing in the vast ocean was becoming difficult due to the pirates looting the Ships.but the Kharva's didn't get afraid and faced them whenever they come to loot . In that time the Porbandar Businessmen hired them for protecting them while going to their destinations. Kharva word is derived from Gujarati Khar which refers to Salty Water and VA( Hava )which means air. *When Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered Europe-to-India sea route in 1497, he had a Gujarati by his side to show him the way. Historians and scholars gathered at Gujarat's port town Mandvi are discussing how a Kutchi sailor, Kanji Malam, navigated the commander to Calicut from Malindi on east African coast. Malam hailed from Mandvi, a shipbuilding hub, where a three-day maritime conference 'Gujarat and the sea' is in progress. Scholars and research institutes from France, Portugal, China, Singapore and Sri Lanka are taking part in the event. At Malindi, Gama's crew roped in a pilot who could guide the expedition to Calicut . Historians have differed over the identity of the sailor, calling him a Christian and a Gujarati. German author Justus says it was Malam(Kharva) and he was a Hindu Gujarati who accompanied Vasco .Italian researcher Sinthia Salvadori too has concluded that it was Malam who showed Gama the way to India. Salvadori has made this observation in her 'We Came In Dhows', an account written after interacting with people in Gujarat. \\"Malam's role in the Vasco expedition has largely been overlooked by historians. It is high time we studied this,\\" says historian Makrand Mehta, who will address the conference on Sunday. On Saturday, scholars like Lotika Varadrajan, Manuel Joao Ramos, Alok Tripathy, Paul Lunde and Vishwarao Sonawane discussed aspects of Gujarat's maritime history.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kutchi-sailor-showed-Vasco- da-way/articleshow/6703424.cms Present circumstances Importing and exporting goods by ship remains the traditional occupation of the community. They trade in many countries, including Oman, U.A.E, Somalia, and also other parts of Africa. Many Kharwa now have their own ships for exporting goods and have set up different cooperative societies. The community is Hindu. Veraval Veraval can be considered a kharva as a main business source income due to seafood export. Mandvi In Kutch, the Kharwa are mainly found in Mandvi, where they are the third largest group with regards to population. In Mandvi, there is a street named Kharva Pachada, which is the second biggest and the largest populated street in Mandvi. There is also a street named kharva pachada in Mota Salaya. Kharvas are also known as Malam or Sagarputra ('Sagar' Means 'Ocean' and 'putra' means 'son', 'Sagarputra' Means \\"Son of the Ocean\\"). There is also an album created by Bharat Kharva named 'Kharva Re Ame Kharva' featuring a song describing the Kharva caste. Kharvas of Mandvi also celebrate their own festivals such as Moti Rawadi, Nava Naroj and Ashar no medo. Mundra They are also found in Mundra in a large number of population.

November 1564) was a Siamese prince and military commander during the Ayutthaya period in the 16th century. He was a son of Prince Thianracha (later King Maha Chakkraphat) and Suriyothai, thus he was a member of the Suphannaphum Dynasty. He was the first of five children: his younger brother Mahin (later King Mahinthrathirat) and three sisters Sawatdirat (who married Maha Thammaracha of Phitsanulok), Boromdilok and Thepkassatri. After the Second Siege of Ayutthaya War of 1563, he and his father were sent to Pegu (Bago) in March 1564. He later became a commander in the Royal Burmese Army, and died in November 1564 of illness during a military campaign to Lan Na. First war In 1548 his father ascended the throne as King of Ayutthaya, he immediately became heir and Uparaja of Siam. During the First Siege of Ayutthaya war with Toungoo Dynasty, Prince Ramesuan together with the King, the Queen, Prince Mahin and Princess Boromdhilok left the walls of the city on their war elephants to engage the Burmese forces led by King Tabinshwehti of Pegu in battle. In the combat with the Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome both his mother and his sister lost their lives. It was recorded in Siamese history that it was Prince Ramesuan who returned his mother's lifeless body to the capital. After a failed siege of the capital city, Tabinshwehti and his forces decided to retreat northward near Mae Sot.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha was ordered to pursue the retreating forces, costing many Burmese lives. Soon the Burmese decided to stand ground and ambush the Siamese forces near Kamphaeng Phet, by dividing their forces on two sides of the road and outflanking Prince Ramesuan's forces. As a result, Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha was captured by the Burmese. This prompted Maha Chakkraphat to negotiate a peace with Tabinshwehti, which resulted in the turning over of two great war elephants and a cease fire. Prince Ramesuan and Thammaracha was released and the Burmese was allowed to retreat unmolested. After the war, the Prince was part of the party inside the Royal court that favoured the dismantling of the walls of the cities of Suphanburi, Lopburi and Nakhon Nayok, this was implemented as a way of depriving a future Burmese invasion with a fortified stronghold, only a day's march from the capital. Second war Maha Chakkraphat after the war of 1548, led a massive hunt for wild elephants (for use in future conflicts), which led to the discovery of seven white elephant. A symbol of prestige as well as honour, their discovery was celebrated by the kingdom, as a sign of the king's righteousness and power. In 1563, Bayinnaung (who succeeded Tabinshwehti in 1551) upon hearing of this news, decided to use the elephants as a pretext for an invasion, by requesting for two of Maha Chakkraphat's white elephants. The 'war party' led by Prince Ramesuan urged the king not to fulfill the request and face certain invasion instead. Following the advice of his heir, Maha Chakkarphat refused and soon enough Bayinnaung invaded Siam. The towns of Sawankhalok, Sukhothai and Phichai fell to the invading forces. After holding out for many months the city of Phitsanulok surrendered to the Burmese forces, Prince Ramesuan's brother-in-law, Maha Thammaracha decided to swear his allegiance to Bayinnaung. The city of Ayutthaya was able to withstand the siege by Burmese forces for many months. However, with the help of Portuguese mercenaries, Bayinnaung was able to constantly bombard the city with cannon fire and flaming projectiles. The inhabitants of the city fearful of the noise and exhausted by the war, petitioned the king to surrender to the enemy and end their suffering. By this time Prince Ramesuan and the war party had lost all credibility within the war council, seeing no other choice the king obliged. Thus Siam became a vassal of Burma on 18 February 1564. With this submission, Bayinnaung was able to create the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. Later life As part of the peace settlement, the prince along with his father the fallen king and thousands of people were taken to Pegu in Burma on 28 March 1564, arriving there on 15 May 1564.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 275 His wife and immediate family also came. The Siamese royal family were given quarters befitting their former status in Pegu. In October 1564, the prince, who was in poor health, nonetheless agreed to march to Lan Na along with the main Burmese army to put down the ongoing rebellion by King Mekuti of Lan Na. The ailing prince died en route to Lan Na in November 1564.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 303He died sometime between 23 October 1564 (start of campaign) and 25 November 1564 (Mekuti's surrender) per (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 278).

With the introduction of economic means of production control and the decrease of the dependence on state, such as self-financing (samofinansirovanie) and khozraschyot, Gospriyomka was destined to decrease in importance, but the collapse of the Soviet Union effectively stopped these developments.

She has previously been Israel's Ambassador to Russia.  Early life and education She was born in Vilnius, Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1959 and emigrated to Israel with her family in 1972. Azari attended the University of Haifa, earning a bachelor's degree in history and English literature and a master‚Äôs in political science. She also garnered a Special Program in Russian Studies from Hebrew University and graduated from the National Security College. Career She has been in the Israeli Foreign Service since the 1980s, and lived in San Francisco from 1989 to 1992, serving as consul-general of Israel to the Pacific Northwest. In 1991, while serving as consul general in San Francisco, Azari criticized Martin S. Weiner, an outspoken local rabbi, for supporting a move by U.S. President George H. W. Bush to delay loan guarantees to Israel. From 1995 to 1997 Azari was first secretary at the Embassy of Israel in Moscow. Beginning in 1999, she served as Ambassador of Israel to both Ukraine and Moldova and, before leaving the post in 2003, was described in the Ukrainian press as one of the country's most popular foreign diplomats. On the day of the September 11 attacks, Azari was meeting with a delegation of physicians from Chicago and Atlanta-based Jewish Healthcare International to discuss their collaborative work with Ukrainian health professionals. The meeting was interrupted when they learned of the attacks and they watched news coverage of the attacks in the meeting room until the embassy was ordered to be evacuated. Following her tenure in Ukraine, Azari ran the Ministry's Eurasia Department where she handled relations with former Soviet states. During this time she was considered to be one of several candidates that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon could choose to appoint as head of Nativ. She was appointed as ambassador to Russia by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni in 2006 and presented her credentials to Russian President Vladimir Putin on 18 January 2007. Over the course of her tenure, Israel and Russia agreed to eliminate the visa requirement for tourists traveling between the two countries and Russia ended a deal to sell Iran S-300 surface-to-air missiles. Dorit Golander was chosen to replace Azari in 2009 and she left the post in the summer of 2010. In an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta prior to her departure, Azari stated that relations between Israel and Russia had improved markedly and that she saw the level of diplomatic activity nearing a par with Russia's relations with bigger countries, such as Germany. Personal life Azari is married to Rabbi Meir Azari who leads the Reform Judaism congregation of Beit Daniel in Tel Aviv and together they have two children. When her appointment as ambassador to Russia was announced, Greer Fay Cashman of The Jerusalem Post suggested her marriage could be a source of contention with orthodox religious communities in Russia.

The first house was built in 1856 by Sir Daniel Cooper and the second by his son, William Charles Cooper, in 1883. Both houses have been demolished, but two buildings still remain from the original structure. The gatekeeper's lodge from Sir Daniel Cooper's house, which was built in 1871, is now the Rose Bay Police Station, and the stables which are now Wyuna Court, a prestigious block of apartments. These buildings in the Municipality of Woollahra are of some historical interest. History=Sir Daniel Cooper The two houses called Woollahra House. The top photo shows the first house built in 1856 by Sir Daniel Cooper, and the bottom photo, with the same outbuildings in the foreground but a larger house in the background, shows the second Woollahra House built in 1883 by William Charles Cooper. Rose Bay Police Station Daniel Cooper was born in 1821 in Lancashire, England. He was the second son of Thomas Cooper, a merchant and came to Australia as a child with his parents. He returned to England at the age of 14 to complete his education but came back to Australia in 1843 and became a commercial partner with James Holt. He later became a member of Parliament and was elected as Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. In 1846 he married Elizabeth Hill, who was the third daughter of William Hill of Sydney. Over the next thirteen years while they lived in Sydney, the couple had two sons and five daughters. In 1856 Cooper started building Woollahra House, and to mark the occasion he held a very large ceremony to lay the foundation stone, at which 400 guests were present. While the house was being built, the Coopers lived in the nearby residence called Rose Bay Lodge, also owned by Cooper. It is not certain when the Cooper family moved into Woollahra House, although it was before 1860 as there is a birth notice for a son born at Rose Bay Lodge in July 1860 to the wife of Walter Lamb, who were known to be renting the Lodge at about this time. Cooper sailed to England with his family in 1861 and did not return. Cooper retained ownership of Woollahra House for the next 22 years while he lived in England. Anthony Trollope during his visit to Australia in 1873 made the following observations about the original Woollahra House: Edward Smith Hill Edward Smith Hill was the brother in law of Sir Daniel Cooper. He came to Woollahra House in 1862 and stayed there until his death in 1880. His obituary of 1880 says that he resided at Woollahra House for the last 18 years. Hill was the brother of Daniel Cooper's wife, Elizabeth, and of George Hill (1802‚Äì1883) who was the Mayor of Sydney in the 1850s. Hill was born in 1819 in Sydney. His parents were William Hill and Mary Johnson, who had both been convicts and had subsequently acquired wealth through business. In 1844 Hill married Mary Ann Pye, the eldest daughter of Joseph Pye Esq., of . Hill became a wine and spirit merchant, and by the time he moved into Woollahra House he had retired and become a naturalist. He wrote several papers on flora and fauna and was interested in geology. Hill died after a long illness at Woollahra House in 1880, survived by his widow, Mary. William Charles Cooper William Charles Cooper was born in 1851 in Sydney. He was the second son of Daniel Cooper, who built the first Woollahra House. His mother was Elizabeth Hill, the third daughter of William Hill Esq of Sydney. When he was only one year old he inherited a great deal of property from his great uncle, Daniel Cooper and this was held in trust for him until he came of age in 1872. In 1876 Cooper married Alice Helen Hill, and they had three sons and one daughter. In 1882 Cooper purchased the original Woollahra House from his father, Sir Daniel, and in 1883 the foundation stone was laid by Mrs William Cooper for the second Woollahra House. While the house was being constructed the Coopers lived at nearby Kambala, then owned by Walter Lamb. While he was in Sydney Cooper had an interest in horseracing and owned several notable racehorses. He was elected committeeman of the Australian Jockey Club in 1887, but in the following year he resigned as the family decided to live in England. Although he left Sydney in 1888 William Cooper retained ownership of Woollahra House until 1899 and either rented it or allowed his friends and relatives to reside there for short periods. Lady Isabella Martin Isabella Martin was born in 1832 in Sydney; the eldest daughter of William Long, who owned Tusculum in Potts Point. Long was a wine and spirit merchant who had become very wealthy. In 1853 Isabella married Sir James Martin, a lawyer and later Premier of New South Wales and Chief Justice of New South Wales. By the middle of the 1870s Lady Martin had given birth to 15 children. Sir James Martin had bought Clarens in Potts Point, but Lady Martin became increasingly dissatisfied with the house as her family grew, and it became too small for such a large number of children. She was also concerned about the location of the house. It was on Rushcutter's Bay, which at that time was associated with an outbreak of typhoid fever. In 1880 and 1881 her sister and two of her children died and she became increasingly concerned about the health of her family. She had inherited considerable wealth from her father, who had set up a Trust Fund for her in his will. In 1882 she left her husband and, with her own wealth, rented houses further away from the central part of Sydney. The first house she rented was Greycliffe, , and the Sands Directory shows that she stayed there until 1889, when she moved to Woollahra House. At this time the house was still owned by William Cooper, who had moved to England. The Sands Directory shows that she rented Woollahra House from 1889 until 1892. The beach at the front of the house was later named Lady Martin Beach in her honour. Sir and Lady Paston-Cooper A garden party hosted by Lady Paston-Cooper at Woollahra House in 1897, as published in The Sydney Mail. Sir and Lady Astley Paston-Cooper were English and they lived at Woollahra House during a visit to Australia from 1896 until 1898. They frequently appeared in the social columns of the Sydney newspapers because they liked to entertain. The Sydney Mail gave the following description of a garden party held at Woollahra House in 1897:The Sydney Mail, 25 September 1897, pp. 650, 662. In 1898 William Cooper decided to live in England permanently. In 1899 the estate, which at that time was , was subdivided and put on the market. Woollahra House retained of this area. A description of the house was advertised as follows: Thomas Longworth William Longworth (1892‚Äì1969), the son of Thomas Longworth, competed in the 1912 Olympic Games while a resident of Woollahra House. Thomas Longworth bought Woollahra House in 1899 and lived there until his death in 1927. Longworth lived in Woollahra House longer than any other resident. Born in 1857 in , his parents were Thomas Longworth and Rose Gardiner, who were from the Channel Islands. Longworth worked in a coal mine, first in Newcastle and then in when the family opened their own small mine there. In 1884 he married Frances Nowlan and over the next twenty years they had a family of seven sons and two daughters. One of their sons, William was a very good swimmer, and while he was a resident of Woollahra House, competed at the 1912 Olympic Games. In 1894 Longworth became a member of the Great Cobar Mining Syndicate which reopened the Cobar Copper Mine and considerably expanded and improved it. In 1908 this syndicate founded the Australian Woollen Mills in , and Longworth was the chairman until 1927. During World War I the mill produced large quantities of khaki for the 1st Australian Imperial Force. Longworth also had interests in brickworks, potteries, timber-mills and pastoral properties and accumulated considerable wealth. While Longworth owned Woollahra House he furthered his interest in racehorses and owned, with his brother, several notable thoroughbreds. He also built a steam yacht called Cobar for use on Sydney Harbour. Longworth died at Woollahra House in 1927. In 1929 the house was sold to a business group who subdivided and sold the land and marketed the house as a site \\"for demolition and removal within four months of the date of sale\\".  Surviving buildings  The gatekeeper's lodge of Woollahra House still survives and is now the Rose Bay Police Station. The other substantial part which remains is the stables which were converted to the prestigious apartments of Wyuna Court. James Haydon Leslie Arnott, CEO Arnott's Biscuits, bought the old stables, converted them and lived there until he died in 1931.

Although the Court has never allowed cameras in its courtroom, it does make audiotapes of oral arguments and opinions available to the public.Tong, Lorraine H. \\"Televising Supreme Court and Other Federal Court Proceedings: Legislation and Issues\\" Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress (November 8, 2006) HistoryCongressional action In 2009, Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter and seven co-sponsors introduced a resolution to express the sense of Congress that sessions of the Court should be televised. In 2009, Specter also introduced a bill that would require open sessions of the Court to be televised. Upon introducing his bill to require televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings, Arlen Specter announced, \\"[t]he Supreme Court makes pronouncements on constitutional and federal law that have direct impacts on the rights of Americans. Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented.\\" \\"Specter Introduces Resolution to Televise Supreme Court Proceedings\\" press release (November 5, 2009) Eight U.S. Senators co-sponsored Spector's resolution. S.RES.339 on the Library of Congress website Ted Poe, R-TX2, introduced a related bill in the House of Representatives in January 2009. H.R.429 on the Library of Congress website The only exception to televising the Court under this legislation would be if a majority of justices decided that \\"allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate the due process rights of any of the parties involved.\\" S.446 on the Library of Congress website Support Supporters of Specter's proposal reason that other government proceedings are already televised, including sessions of both the House of Representative and the Senate, covered most frequently by C-SPAN.Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll \\"Public Says Televising Court Is Good for Democracy\\" press release (March 9, 2010) By televising the Court, they argue that Americans would have more access to the most important institution in the U.S. judiciary, which would result in a more open and transparent government. Bruce Peabody of Fairleigh Dickinson University contends that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings can change the way Americans view public policy by bringing greater attention to the Court.Peabody, Bruce \\"Legislating Supreme Court TV\\" The Christian Science Monitor (September 28, 2006) A 2010 New York Times editorial states that public access to the court would give Americans the opportunity to get a closer look at how a powerful branch of government operates. It adds that the televising the Court would hold presidents accountable for the justices they nominate. The editorial reasons, \\"[r]ight now, we see the justices during their confirmation hearings and rarely after that.\\"Your Reality TV The New York Times editorial (March 13, 2010) During her confirmation hearing in 2009, Justice Sonia Sotomayor indicated that she is open to the idea of televising court proceedings, stating, \\"I have had positive experiences with cameras. When I have been asked to join experiments of using cameras in the courtroom, I have participated. I have volunteered.\\" Cameras in the Court on the C-SPAN website Cameras in the Court has also been supported by advocacy groups including Fix the Court. Opposition Opponents of Specter's proposal believe that requiring the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States to be televised is a threat to judicial independence and, thus, the separation of powers. In addition, several justices of the Court have objected to the proposed legislation, including Justice Anthony Kennedy who argues that the measure would not align with the \\"etiquette\\" and \\"deference\\" that should \\"apply between branches.\\"Peabody, Bruce \\"Constitutional Etiquette and the Fate of 'Supreme Court TV'\\" Michigan Law Review (ndg) Furthermore, some justices believe televising the proceedings would change the way they act in the courtroom. Justice Clarence Thomas also contends that televising Court proceedings would reduce the level of anonymity that justices now have and could raise security concerns. Opponents also believe that television coverage would also take away from the mystery of the court and cause the public to misinterpret the Court and its processes. Scholars have also considered the constitutionality of legislatively requiring the televising of Supreme Court proceedings.Peabody, Bruce and Gant, Scott. \\"Debate: Congress's Power to Compel the Televising of Supreme Court Proceedings\\" University of Pennsylvania Law Review Vol. 156:46 2007Peabody, Bruce \\"Supreme Court TV: Televising the least accountable branch?,' 33 J. Legis. 144, 147-148. (2007) Public opinion In March 2010, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll found in a national poll that more than 60% of voters think that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings would be \\"good for democracy.\\"\\"The Morning Wrap\\" on The BLT: the Blog of Legal Times (March 9, 2010)Woolley, Peter. \\"Washington Journal: Supreme Court Proceedings on Television\\" video on the C-SPAN website (March 9, 2010) 26% think that televising the proceedings would \\"undermine the authority of the court.\\" Voters have mixed opinions on the effect of television coverage on court decisions. While 45% say that televising Court's proceedings would be good \\"because the judges would consider public opinion more\\" in making decisions, 31% say TV would be bad because justices would consider public opinion too much. 25% say are not sure or say that televising the Court would have no effect on its legal decisions. While a majority of voters presently watch government proceedings infrequently if at all, half of voters (50%) say they would watch the Supreme Court of the United States' proceedings sometimes or regularly if they were televised. Only 10% say they‚Äôd never watch the court. Dr. Peter Woolley, director of the FDU poll, said, ‚ÄúVoters are certainly curious about the court, which is both powerful and largely out of the public eye. After the novelty wears off, the primary audience might be lawyers and lobbyists, rather than any broad swath of voters. Most voters will only see it when commercial media select the most controversial bits and pieces.‚Äù But Peabody disagreed, ‚ÄúThe rationale for televising the court is not to guarantee the public will watch it, but to give democracy‚Äôs citizens more opportunities to educate themselves. It is unlikely people will know more about the court by seeing it less.‚Äù Noting the FDU poll, the editors of The New York Times subsequently opined that televising the Court \\"would allow Americans to see for themselves how an extremely powerful part of their government works\\" and \\"allow voters to hold presidents accountable for the quality of justices they nominate. In turn, Diana Schaub of Loyola University criticized the Times for insisting that the justices of the Supreme Court ought to be ‚ÄúYouTubed‚Äù like everyone else. She contends that the Court is already an open book, the most transparent branch of government. Rather than issuing only a verdict, Schaub states, the Court justifies its rulings with detailed opinions that are immediately available to the public. She further notes that only a small slice of the Court‚Äôs work would be revealed on camera if televising oral arguments were required, adding that the ‚Äúun-telegenic activities‚Äù of the Court, which include choosing cases, poring over briefs, writing memos and drafts, and actually deciding cases would not be seen. Furthermore, Schaub declares that the only way for the public to truly have access to the Court is to ‚Äújoin the justices in the difficult work of legal interpretation.‚Äù She states that most Americans would not be willing or even capable of doing this.Schaub, Diana. \\"Supreme Court TV?\\" The Baltimore Sun (March 24, 2010) See also *Sunshine in the Courtroom Act *Fix the Court ReferencesExternal links *Televising Supreme Court and Other Federal Court Proceedings: Legislation and Issues Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress report (November 8, 2006) *\\"Cameras in the Court on the C-SPAN website *\\"Public Says Televising Court Is Good for Democracy\\" Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll (March 9, 2010) Category:Supreme Court of the United States Category:Television in the United States ","title":"Cameras in the Supreme Court of the United States"},{"id":"26583608","text":"Surdo (right) presenting his credentials to Vladimir Putin in July 2006.

During this time, the popes took up residence in the Papal Palace of Orvieto (also known as Palazzo Soliano), which was adjacent to the Orvieto Cathedral and expanded onto the bishop's residence. None of these popes died in Orvieto, and thus no papal elections took place in there, nor are there any papal tombs. Political and strategic reasons motivated the frequent moves of the pope and Roman Curia during this period, and other destinations include Viterbo and Perugia. Urban IV and Martin IV resided in both Viterbo and Orvieto. During the period from the reign of Nicholas IV to Benedict XI (1303‚Äì1304), Orvieto hosted the pope more frequently than Rome. Art historian Gary M. Radke notes that \\"the papal palaces in Viterbo and Orvieto are the most extensive thirteenth-century papal palaces to survive to our own day.\\" He dates the frescoes in the palace to the 1290s, during the reign of Nicholas IV or Boniface VIII.Gary M. Radke. 1984. \\"Medieval Frescoes in the Papal Palaces of Viterbo and Orvieto.\\" Gesta 23(1): 27‚Äì38. They display naturalistic impulses in the Gothic style. Background The city is mentioned in the writings of Gregory I (590‚Äì604). Adrian IV (1154‚Äì59) was the first pope to spend significant time in Orvieto. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"on account of its position, Orvieto was often chosen by the popes as a place of refuge and Adrian IV fortified it.\\" His successor, Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216), was a militant opponent of the Cathar heresy, which had infiltrated the city, and took measures to eradicate that heresy; Innocent III sent Pietro Parenzo to govern the city, who was quickly martyred. In 1227, Gregory IX (1227‚Äì1241) confirmed the Dominican studium generale in Orvieto, a school of theology, one of the first in Europe. History The palace was expanded during the reign of Urban IV (1261‚Äì1264), but the \\"northwest hall must have been built earlier.\\" Urban IV was French and had been crowned in Viterbo, but spent most of his papacy in Orvieto. The structure became a papal palace during Urban IV's two-year stay in Orvieto, starting October 18, 1262, although it may not have been completed until Gregory X (1271‚Äì1276) took up residence there on July 26, 1272. Urban began construction in 1263, the year he consecrated a new Dominican church in Orvieto. The first mention of the papal palace in contemporary documents dates to April 1, 1273. Martin IV (1281‚Äì1285) was in Orvieto between March 23, 1281 and June 24, 1282, and then nearby in Montefiascone in the summer and fall of 1282. He returned to Orvieto from December 25, 1282 until June 27, 1284. He likely chose to reside in his fortress in Montefiascone while the Orvieto residence was being expanded. The modern Cathedral of Orvieto itself was begun in 1285. Nicholas IV (1288‚Äì1292) was in Orvieto from June 13, 1290 to October 19, 1291. Although Nicholas IV was Roman by birth, he brought the Curia with him to Orvieto. Nicholas IV was elected Podest√† and Capitano del Popolo of Orvieto, the first pope to hold civic offices in the city. Boniface VIII (1294‚Äì1303) arrived in Orvieto on June 6, 1297 and left that same month. During his stay, the Commune placed his coat of arms on the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, erected statutes of him on two gates of the city, and unveiled frescoes on the gates and paintings inside the Palazzo del Populo. Boniface VIII was elected Capitano and Podest√† in 1297, and Capitano again in 1298. Later papal ties Pozzo di S. Patrizio Nicholas V (1447‚Äì55) in a 1449 letter gave money for the restoration of the Episcopal Palace and authorized Fra Angelico to begin painting in the Cappella Nuova of the Cathedral. During the Sack of Rome (1527), Clement VII (1523‚Äì1534) took refuge at Orvieto. Preparing for a possible siege of the city, he ordered the Pozzo di S. Patrizio (\\"Well of St. Patrick) constructed by architect-engineer Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Of course, the pope and emperor had reconciled long before the well was completed. Sixtus V (1585‚Äì1590) drained the swamps around the city. Ownership of the palace passed from the pope to the cathedral in 1550, and the structure became a museum in 1896. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"in the palace of the popes, built by Boniface VIII, is the civic museum, which contains Etruscan antiquities and works of art that are, for the greater part, from the cathedral.\\" Notes Category:History of the papacy Category:Orvieto Category:13th-century Catholicism Category:History of Umbria ","title":"Orvieto Papacy"},{"id":"26583655","text":"Svinjare () is a village in northern Kosovo, near Vuƒçitrn.

The church is at the junction of Vicarage Road and Church Lane. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1949. History The earliest surviving parts of the present building are the possibly pre-Conquest doorway now located between the Lady Chapel and Sacristy, and the south wall of the chancel. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower is 15th century, built in about 1480. The remainder of the church is Victorian, built or rebuilt between 1847 and 1884.Lillington Church about 1805The old south aisle was extended and the north aisle added in 1847. The south aisle was then demolished and a wider aisle built in 1868. Dormer windows were inserted in the roof in 1875. In 1884 the chancel, apart from the south wall, was rebuilt and the Lady chapel and Sacristy on the north side of the chancel were added, the Romanesque doorway being relocated for the second time since 1847. Three of the stained glass windows are by C.E. Kempe and Company: the east window of the south aisle (1895) and two windows in the north aisle (1908 and 1920). A choir vestry was added in 1914. The pulpit is 20th century, designed by T. Lawrence Dale. A detached octagonal meeting room in the churchyard was built in 1987. Benjamin Satchwell, co-founder, promoter and poet of the spa at nearby Leamington, married Mary Whitmore in this church on 23 April 1764.Lillington Parish Registers, Warwickshire County Record Office DR426/5 In the churchyard, opposite the vestry door, is the famous 'Miser's Grave'. The headstone of William Treen, who died aged 77 on 3 February 1810, carries this inscription, quoted in many nineteenth-century guides to Leamington,James Bissett‚Äôs Descriptive Guide of Leamington Priors, 1814, et al. and most famously by Nathaniel Hawthorne in Our Old HomeNathaniel Hawthorne, Our Old Home, 1863, http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/ooh.html in 1863: \\"I Poorly Liv'd and Poorly Dy'd, Poorly Bury'd and no one Cry'd.\\" Bells The church has a ring of eight bells. The sixth bell is attributed to Thomas Harrys of London, cast about 1480, which makes it contemporary with the tower. The seventh bell was cast in 1625 by Watts of Leicester, and the tenor in 1675 by Henry Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the remaining five bells in 1927. The bells were re-hung by Nicholson Engineering of Bridport, Dorset in 2007. Clock Lillington church clock was made by Potts of Leeds and installed in 1897. It seems that the tower had no clock before then. The clock was renovated, the four dials repainted and gilded, and the mechanism repositioned within the ringing chamber, by the Cumbria Clock Company of Penrith in 2007.

He presented the Sunday morning sports programme Sportsweek on BBC Radio 5 Live until 15 September 2019, and remains a sports presenter on the weekday morning Today show on BBC Radio 4. Career Garry Richardson began his broadcasting career with BBC Radio Oxford. He had previously been a youth player at Reading and Southampton football clubs but quickly realised that he was unlikely to become a professional footballer. Richardson gave his first sports report on national radio in 1981 as a 'cub' reporter, introduced by Today's co-presenter Brian Redhead for the match between Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Under the tutorship of Tony Adamson, Bryon Butler and the commentator Peter Jones, Richardson rose to become the regular sports reporter on the show, a role he has assumed for over 20 years. For 20 years Richardson presented the highly successful Sunday morning sports programme Sportsweek on BBC Radio 5 Live BBC podcasts. He was known for presenting the show with a direct and persistent interview style. He has stated that he believes in asking the same question three times if he has not received a response, a style also favoured by fellow journalists Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys. He gained interviews from a wide range of sources (football) and regularly had guests from the national press as co-host. The show won a Sony Gold Award in 2007 for Best Sports Programme. The show was nominated in the same category in the 2009 awards but lost out to 5 Live's coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics (Olympic Breakfast (gold) and Olympic Sportsworld (bronze)) and also The Football Forum (silver). He began presenting a sports sketch and interview show, Look Away Now, for BBC Radio 4 in 2007 spoofing his own style. In March 2017, Richardson, ended a Today interview with cricketer James Anderson by saying that \\"[Anderson] was speaking to us in conjunction with Brut aftershave, who he is an ambassador for,‚Äù which prompted the BBC to apologise for its promotion of the product against editorial guidelines. Famous interviews Richardson has interviewed a variety of personalities from the world of sport and politics. In 2002 he irritated tennis player Anna Kournikova, who requested the interview be restarted when he cast aspersions on her ability to play at Wimbledon.

Meyer discussed the genesis of the idea (his father was a psychiatrist and Meyer was a fan of Holmes' creator Arthur Conan Doyle) and how he took the opportunity to write the novel when the Writers Guild of America went on strike. Meyer revealed that he had often fought with Ross because Ross was too faithful to Meyer's novel. He believed that the script would not be cinematic enough if it was too faithful with the source. He discussed the casting including his push for Alan Arkin as Freud. He shared a story about how he and Ross decided to cast Duvall \\"in revolt\\" against Nigel Bruce's portrayal of Watson as a \\"Colonel Blimp\\" type character. Meyer and Ross wanted to try and capture Watson's intelligence that had so far not been portrayed on screen in Holmes movie adaptations.

He is said to have been from the family of Saint Joseph, the adoptive father of Jesus. Although Abris is included in traditional lists of primates of the Church of the East, his existence has been doubted by some scholars like J. M. Fiey, a twentieth-century scholars of the Church of the East. In Fiey's view, Abris was one of several fictitious bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon whose lives were concocted in the sixth century to bridge the gap between the late third century bishop Papa, the first historically attested bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and the apostle Mari, the legendary founder of Christianity in Persia.Fiey, Jalons, 64‚Äì5 Sources Brief accounts of the life of Abris are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Syriac Orthodox writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). Abris is also mentioned in the Chronicle of Erbil, a text whose authenticity and reliability have been hotly disputed. Life of Abris The following account of the life of Abris is given by the twelfth- century Nestorian writer Mari: > Abris, a Hebrew, from the family of Joseph the carpenter, the husband of our > Virgin Lady, was chosen by Simon, son of Cleophas, bishop of Jerusalem. He > was renowned for his continence and probity. It is said that after the death > of the apostle Mar Mari the people disagreed over who should occupy his > throne; and after they asked God in prayer to choose the worthiest man among > them, several holy men saw in a dream a man urging them to choose Abris, but > they did not know who he was. Then the vision was repeated, and they learned > that he was about to enter the church to seek a blessing. When they saw him, > they understood. They admitted him to all the orders of the priesthood at > once, and sent him into the East. He was a man of exemplary virtue, > charitable towards the needy and the poor, prone to good deeds and repelled > by the way of the world. He only ordained those who were as chaste as he > himself. He passed over to the kingdom of peace after leading the church for > sixteen years.Mari, On the Nestorian Patriarchs (ed. Gismondi), 4‚Äì5 (Latin) The following account of the life of Abris is given by the thirteenth-century Jacobite historian Bar Hebraeus, who used two different spellings of his name (Abrosius and Abrisius) within a single paragraph. Bar Hebraeus is normally dependent on Mari for his information, but in the case of Abris has clearly derived some of his account from another source: > After Mari, his disciple Abrosius. His master Mari had sent him to Antioch, > to visit the brethren there and to bring him back news of them. After the > death of the blessed Mari the faithful of the East sent to Antioch and asked > to be given a bishop. And the disciples of that place laid hands upon > Abrosius and sent him back to occupy the throne of his master. There he > ruled the faithful for seventeen years until his death.

She is also known as the earth/time mother.Dransart, Penny. (1992) \\"Pachamama: The Inka Earth Mother of the Long Sweeping Garment.\\" Dress and Gender: Making and Meaning. Ed. Ruth Barnes and Joanne B. Eicher. New York/Oxford: Berg. 145-63. Print. In Inca mythology, Pachamama is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting, embodies the mountains, and causes earthquakes. She is also an ever-present and independent deity who has her own creative power to sustain life on this earth. Her shrines are hallowed rocks, or the boles of legendary trees, and artists envision her as an adult female bearing harvests of potatoes and coca leaves. The four cosmological Quechua principles ‚Äì Water, Earth, Sun, and Moon ‚Äì claim Pachamama as their prime origin. Priests sacrifice offerings of llamas, cuy (guinea pigs), and elaborate, miniature, burned garments to her. Pachamama is the mother of Inti the sun god and Mama Killa the moon goddess. Pachamama is said also be the wife of Inti, her son. After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, they forced conversion to Roman Catholicism. As it is a syncretic religion, the figure of the Virgin Mary was associated with that of the Pachamama for many of the indigenous people. As Andean cultures formed modern nations, the figure of Pachamama was still believed to be benevolent, generous with her gifts, and a local name for Mother Nature. In the 21st century, many indigenous peoples in South America base environmental concerns in these ancient beliefs, saying that problems arise when people take too much from nature because they are taking too much from Pachamama. Etymology Pachamama is usually translated as Mother Earth. A more literal translation would be \\"World Mother\\" (in the Aymara and Quechua languages). The Inca goddess can be referred to in multiple ways; the primary way being Pachamama. Other names for her are: Mama Pacha, La Pachamama, and Mother Earth. Modern-day rituals Pachamama Museum in Argentina Pachamama and her son-husband, Inti, are worshiped as benevolent deities in the area known as Tawantinsuyu. Tawantinsuyu is the name of the former Inca Empire, and the region stretches through the Andean mountains in present-day Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, and northern Argentina. People usually give a toast to honor Pachamama before meetings and festivities. In some regions, people perform a special kind of libation known as a challa on a daily basis. They spill a small amount of chicha on the floor, for the goddess, and then drink the rest. Pachamama has a special worship day called Martes de challa (Challa's Tuesday). People bury food, throw candies, and burn incense to thank Pachamama for their harvests. In some cases, celebrants assist traditional priests, known as yatiris in Aymara, in performing ancient rites to bring good luck or the good will of the goddess, such as sacrificing guinea pigs or burning llama fetuses (although this is rare today). The festival coincides with the Christian holiday of Shrove Tuesday, also celebrated among Catholics as Carnevale or Mardi Gras. The central ritual to Pachamama is the Challa or Pago (payment). It is carried out during all of August, and in many places also on the first Friday of each month. Other ceremonies are carried out in special times, as upon leaving for a trip or upon passing an '. According to Mario Rabey and Rodolfo Merlino, Argentine anthropologists who studied the Andean culture from the 1970s to the 1990s, > \\"The most important ritual is the challaco. Challaco is a deformation of the > Quechua words 'ch'allay' and 'ch'allakuy', that refer to the action to > insistently sprinkle. In the current language of the campesinos of the > southern Central Andes, the word challar is used in the sense of \\"to feed > and to give drink to the land\\". The challaco covers a complex series of > ritual steps that begin in the family dwellings the night before. They cook > a special food, the tijtincha. The ceremony culminates at a pond or stream, > where the people offer a series of tributes to Pachamama, including \\"food, > beverage, leaves of coca and cigars.\\" Household rituals Rituals to honor Pachamama take place all year, but are especially abundant in August, right before the sowing season.Matthews- Salazar, Patricia. (2006) \\"Becoming All Indian: Gauchos, Pachamama Queens, and Tourists in the Remaking of an Andean Festival.\\" Festivals, Tourism and Social Change: Remaking Worlds. Ed. David Picard and Mike Robinson. N.p.: Channel View Publications. 71‚Äì81. Because August is the coldest month of the winter in the southern Andes, people feel more vulnerable to illness. August is therefore regarded as a \\"tricky month.\\" During this time of mischief, Andeans believe that they must be on very good terms with nature to keep themselves and their crops and livestock healthy and protected. In order to do this, families perform cleansing rituals by burning plants, wood, and other items in order to scare evil spirits, who are thought to be more abundant at this time. People also drink mate (a South American hot beverage), which is thought to give good luck. On the night before August 1, families prepare to honor Pachamama by cooking all night. The host of the gathering then makes a hole in the ground. If the soil comes out nicely, this means that it will be a good year; if not, the year will not be bountiful. Before any of the guests are allowed to eat, the host must first give a plate of food to Pachamama. Food that was left aside is poured onto the ground and a prayer to Pachamama is recited. Sunday parade A main attraction of the Pachamama festival is the Sunday parade. The organizational committee of the festival searches for the oldest woman in the community and elects her the \\"Pachamama Queen of the Year.\\" This election first occurred in 1949. Indigenous women, in particular senior women, are seen as incarnations of tradition and as living symbols of wisdom, life, fertility, and reproduction. The Pachamama queen who is elected is escorted by the gauchos, who circle the plaza on their horses and salute her during the Sunday parade. The Sunday parade is considered to be the climax of the festival. New Age worship Since the late 20th century, a New Age practice of worship to Pachamama has developed among Andean white and mestizo peoples. Believers perform a weekly ritual worship which takes place on Sundays and includes invocations to Pachamama in Quechua, although there may be some references in Spanish. They have a temple, which inside contains a large stone with a medallion on it, symbolizing the New Age group and its beliefs. A bowl of dirt on the right of the stone is there to represent Pachamama, because of her status as a Mother Earth. Certain travel agencies have drawn upon the emerging New Age movement in Andean communities (drawn from Quechua ritual practices) to urge tourists to visit Inca sites. Tourists visiting such sites as Machu Picchu and Cusco, are also offered the chance to participate in ritual offerings to Pachamama. Pachamama and Christianity Many rituals related to the Pachamama are practiced in conjunction with those of Christianity, to the point that many families are simultaneously Christian and pachamamistas. According to scholar Manuel Marzal, in modern day Peru, the cult of Pachamama has, in some cases, taken on Christian characteristics or been reinterpreted within a Catholic religious framework. Rites like the offering to Pachamama have incorporated ‚Äúcertain Christian symbols and prayers‚Äù and have also been ‚Äúthe object of Christian reinterpretations,‚Äù both implicit and explicit. One of these reinterpretations is that Pachamama represents the natural bounty created by God. For some Andeans, he writes, ‚ÄúPachamama has lost its original identity and has changed into a symbol of the providence of the one God, or [...] a sacred reality that feeds humankind on behalf of God.‚Äù Along similar lines, Pope John Paul II, in two homilies delivered in Peru and Bolivia, identified homage to Pachamama as an ancestral recognition of divine providence that in some sense prefigured a Christian attitude toward creation. On February 3, 1985, he stated that ‚Äúyour ancestors, by paying tribute to the earth (Mama Pacha), were doing nothing other than recognizing the goodness of God and his beneficent presence, which provided them food by means of the land they cultivated.‚Äù On May 11, 1988, he stated that God ‚Äúknows what we need from the food that the earth produces, this varied and expressive reality that your ancestors called ‚ÄúPachamama‚Äù and that reflects the work of divine providence as it offers us its gifts for the good of man.‚Äù Marzal also states that for some Andeans, Pachamama retains an ‚Äúintermediary role‚Äù between God and man within a primarily Catholic framework similar to that of the saints.Marzal, pp. 411‚Äì412. Some ethnographic scholars have also noted a syncretic identification of Pachamama with the Virgin Mary.Marzal, p. 414. Pachamama is sometimes syncretized as the Virgin of Candelaria. Political usage Belief in Pachamama features prominently in the Peruvian national narrative. Former President Alejandro Toledo held a symbolic inauguration on 28 July 2001 atop Machu Picchu. The ceremony featured a Quechua religious elder giving an offering to Pachamama. Some Andean intellectuals identify Pachamama as an example of autochthony. Former Bolivian president Evo Morales invoked the name of Pachamama, as well as using language and symbolism that appealed to Bolivia's indigenous population, in speeches throughout his presidency.

Located between the Max-Weber-Platz and the Wiener Markt Maximilianeum ‚Äì Seat of the Bavarian Parliament The ‚ÄûKriechbaumhof‚Äú in the Preysingstra√üe The culture and education center Gasteig The Wei√üenburger fountain on Wei√üenburger Platz between Rosenheimer Platz and Ostbahnhof Haidhausen (Central Bavarian: Haidhausn) is a quarter of Munich, Germany. It is now part of the borough‚Äîor stadtbezirk‚Äînumber 5 Au-Haidhausen. Location Haidhausen is bordered to the north by Bogenhausen, Berg am Laim to the east, to the south by Au, and the west border of the district is delimited by the Isar river. The boundary of the zone runs north along the Prinzregentenstra√üe avenue then west of the square Vogelweideplatz between the civic amenity site and the tram depot on the railway track which forms the eastern border, where the entire track is still part of Haidhausen. In the south the Rosenheimer, Hoch, Rabl and Balanstra√üe streets form the border with Au. To the west there are the right banks of the Isar river. History Haidhausen was first mentioned in the year 808 under the name of haidhusir described in the documents as a settlement of small houses and a church. From Munich you can reach it via the \\"gaachen Steig\\" (very steep path), which in the course of time became the term \\"Gasteig\\". The word also stands for the well-known cultural centre that marks the border to Haidhausen today. The salt trail led through Haidhausen to Munich. The production of clay bricks made from loamy soil was economically important at an early stage. In the High Middle Ages Haidhausen belonged to the domain of the Counts of Wolfratshausen and after their extinction in 1157 to the Counts of Die√üen, who renamed themselves von Andechs. Even before the death of the last Count Andechs, Otto III in 1248, the area passed to the Duchy of Bavaria of the Wittelsbach family in 1246 at the latest. From 1610 or 1612 Haidhausen as well as the neighbouring villages Au and Untergiesing belonged to the court ob der Au. In Haidhausen was the country seat of the Counts of Preysing-Hohenaschau from the 17th century to 1827. Their castle later became church property and in its place the still existing monastery buildings were erected in Preysingstra√üe. Not far from today's Wiener Platz, small-town structures with hostels for poorer sections of the population had already developed at an early stage, who worked for example in the brick factories. The last of these houses can still be seen today, for example on the Kreppe. In 1835 there were already 10,000 people living in Haidhausen. Especially at the end of the 19th century, Haidhausen grew strongly as a result of industrialisation. At this time, the hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar was founded here and the Maximilianeum was built as the end point of Maximiliansstra√üe. On October 1, 1854, the incorporation of Haidhausen together with Au and Giesing into the city of Munich took place after the inhabitants of the villages had declared their support almost unanimously in May 1848. After two years of construction, the Haidhaus railway station, built by Friedrich B√ºrklein, architect of the Maximilianeum, was opened in 1871. At that time the area \\"Auf den L√ºften\\" between the railway station (east), Rosenheimer Stra√üe (south), Milch- and Steinstra√üe (west), Preysingstra√üe (north) was still undeveloped. In 1870, Arnold von Zenetti designed a Wilhelminian style urban expansion plan for the \\"Streets to Braunau Railway Station\\" for the development of this area. The semicircular Orleansplatz formed the basis for the symmetrical three-beam system of the Ostbahnhofviertel, which is also known as the \\"French Quarter\\" because of its streets named after French towns: W√∂rthstra√üe became the central axis - Wei√üenburger Stra√üe and Belfortstra√üe the diagonal. In 1872 the first streets were laid out and named after places of victorious battles of the Franco- Prussian War of 1870/71. An exception is Bordeauxplatz, which was later named after the town partnership between Munich and Bordeaux. The area was built between 1870 and 1900 from Rosenheimer Strasse in a northerly direction‚Äîmainly in the style of the Neo-Renaissance of the 1880s and the New Baroque of the 1890s. The development was carried out closely in order to provide affordable housing for the poorer population. Around 1900, one of the most densely populated areas in Munich developed, which today has a particularly high proportion (66%) of older buildings (before 1914). The 1910 census revealed a population of over 60,000 in the Haidhausen area, and on 5 May 1919, after the Munich R√§terepublik had been smashed up, the innkeepers of the Hofbr√§ukeller were shot by members of the Freikorps, who had previously denounced the citizens of Perlach. On 16 October 1919 Adolf Hitler gave his first party political speech to 111 visitors in the Hofbr√§ukeller. On the eve of the Hitler coup on November 8, 1923, Hitler proclaimed the 'National Revolution' in the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller on Rosenheimerstrasse. For a long time, Haidhausen in Munich was regarded as a \\"shattered glass district\\" due to its poor conditions. When in the 1980s industrial areas were demolished and replaced by living space, the municipal Gallery Lothringer13 in Lothringerstr. 13, the Muffathalle and the Gasteig Cultural Centre were built, the old buildings were also gradually renovated. The attractiveness of the district gradually increased, so that today Haidhausen is counted among Munich's coveted residential areas, which are characterised by a multitude of shops, caf√©s, restaurants and a broad cultural offer. Church Buildings * Catholic parish church St. Johann Baptist * Catholic parish church St. Wolfgang * Lutheran parish church St. Johannes * Catholic parish church St. Gabriel * Catholic parish church Alte Haidhauser Kirche Nightlife Due to its wide range of bars and restaurants, Haidhausen is considered the third centre of Munich's nightlife after the Glockenbachviertel and Schwabing.

The play is about a group of unmarried women who choose to avoid the pains of men and marriage by creating their own community. The main characters of this play are Lady Happy, the Monsieurs who wish to remove her from the convent, and the Princess, who joins Lady Happy's convent and woos her. The play was published in London under Cavendish's own name, a rare choice for a woman writer in 1668. As the play is a closet drama, Cavendish did not attempt to have it staged. Two passages in the play are credited to her husband, as denoted by the insertion of \\"Written by my Lord Duke\\" above these scenes.  Characters  * Lady Happy: a wealthy unmarried woman who inherits her father's estate and decides to seclude herself in it with only women. * Madam Mediator: a widow and a friend of Lady Happy who does not join the convent of pleasure, but is allowed to visit. * The Princess: a character who asks to join the convent, and forms a romantic relationship with Lady Happy. This character is listed as \\"The Princess\\" in the first edition list of characters, and for most of the play, stage directions refer to this character as \\"Princess.\\" Near the end of the play, an ambassador arrives who declares that the Princess is a prince who has gone missing from his kingdom; from this point, the stage directions refer to this character as the \\"Prince\\" rather than the \\"Princess.\\" * Monsieur Take-Pleasure: the informal leader of a group of men who wish to prevent the women from living in the convent. He is accompanied by Dick his Man, and by Monsieur Facil, Monsieur Adviser, and Monsieur Courtly. * Lady Amorous and Lady Vertue: two married women who live outside the convent, friends of Madam Mediator. Several of the secondary characters also appear in Cavendish's play The Bridals: namely, Lady Amourous, Lady Virtue, Monsieur Take-Pleasure, Monsieur Adviser, and Monsieur Facil.  Summary  Act I: Monsieur Take-Pleasure and other Monsieurs resolve to woo the newly-wealthy Lady Happy. Lady Happy and Madam Mediator engage in a lengthy philosophical discourse on pleasure and marriage. Lady Happy resolves to use her wealth to live in a cloister with unmarried women according to principles of pleasure. Act II: The Monsieurs lament Lady Happy's decision and scheme ways to woo her anyway. On Madam Mediator's advice, they resolve to petition the State to force her out. Lady Happy describes to Madam Mediator in lush detail how much she and her ladies are enjoying their life in the convent. Madam Mediator talks to two married woman, Lady Vertue and Lady Amorous, about a princess who has just joined the convent. The married women wish they could experience the convent's pleasures, but Madam Mediator tells them its delights are unimaginable. The Monsieurs scheme again to force the women out of the convent. They decide to disguise themselves as working-class women to enter. Act III: The Princess notes that many of the women in the convent have paired off together romantically, and asks to ‚Äúact Lovers-parts‚Äù in male attire with Lady Happy, who gladly agrees. A play-within-a-play is staged, presenting the various woes of marriage (infidelity, domestic violence) and pregnancy. When the play concludes, the Princess expresses mild disapproval, saying that more people are happy in their marriages than are unhappy. Meanwhile, the Monsieurs conclude that the convent cannot be dissolved. Act IV: Lady Happy wanders sadly dressed as a shepherdess, feeling that her love for the Princess is too much. The Princess arrives dressed as a Shepherd and they embrace and kiss. There is a pastoral scene: another woman dressed as shepherd woos Lady Happy but is rejected; the Princess woos Lady Happy and is accepted; there is a dance with a prize awarded to the best dancers, Lady Happy and the Princess. The pastoral scene closes with verses indicated to be written by Margaret Cavendish's husband. The Princess soliloquizes, resolving to remain with Lady Happy rather than return to the masculine outside world. An extended water-nymph scene begins: the Princess, dressed as Neptune, and Lady Happy, dressed as a sea goddess, sit surrounded by sea-nymphs and describe their luxurious underwater kingdom. A sea nymph sings a song. Act V: Lady Happy and the Princess arrive at a dance together, with the Princess dressed in masculine apparel. Madam Mediator arrives and announces that a prince is in disguise within the convent. The Princess calmly expects to be above suspicion, but an ambassador arrives, kneels at the Princess's feet, and reports that their kingdom is planning to invade Lady Happy's kingdom because they believe their prince has been kidnapped. The Prince(ss) announces: ‚Äúsince I am discover'd, go from me to the Councellors of this State, and inform them of my being here, as also the reason, and that I ask their leave I may marry this Lady; otherwise, tell them I will have her by force of Arms.‚Äù The next scene is indicated to be written by the Duke: Madam Mediator weeps to the gentlemen of the town that the reputation of the convent has been destroyed by the discovery of a man within its walls. There is some innuendo mocking Madam Mediator's sexual appetite. She asks the gentleman to keep the Princess's sex a secret; they tell her that the news is already broadly known. Lady Happy and the Prince are married. They dance. The Prince promises to maintain the convent for virgins and widows.  Major themes = Resistance to Marriage  Erin Lang Bonin interprets The Convent of Pleasure as an attempted utopia, one of several plays in which Cavendish \\"reconfigures traditional distinctions between private and public by creating utopian heroines who take women's sequestration to extremes, completely insulating themselves from men's public spheres.\\" In Bonin's interpretation, Lady Happy begins the play firmly positioned within the heterosexual, reproductive economy as an heiress who is a valuable commodity in the multiple senses of the term. When she withdraws to the convent, Lady Happy angers the patriarchy by taking her body and her possessions out of circulation. Because the convent rejects marriage, Bonin argues, it threatens larger political contexts. Bonin sees this threat voiced by Monsieur Facil, who implies a masculinist conflation of family and state when he demands that Lady Happy be forced out of her convent \\"for the good of the Commonwealth\\" (p. 11). Bonin compares The Convent of Pleasure to Cavendish's The Female Academy, another female separatist utopia, to argue that The Convent of Pleasure reinforces its separatist stance through the way the characters talk. Lady Happy's rhetoric celebrates the convent's paradoxical walled freedom, refashioning marriage into the true cloister: \\"Marriage to those that are virtuous is a greater restraint than a Monastery,\\" she insists (p. 3). To further emphasize the restrictions of marriage, the play includes a play-within-a-play that depicts the physical and emotional pains of being a wife, redirecting female desires toward other spheres (pp. 24‚Äì30). Kelsey Brooke Smith of Brigham Young University wrote her dissertation on chastity as a political power in The Convent of Pleasure. Her analysis of Lady Happy portrayed her as a \\"virtuous, wealthy, and beautiful young virgin\\" who is understandably sought after during this time.Smith, Kelsey Brooke. Perilous Power: Chastity as Political Power in William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure and Margaret Cavendish's Assaulted and Pursued Chastity. Dissertation, Brigham Young University, 2014. BYU, 2014. Lady Happy does not want to marry because it would only bring her unhappiness. She says in the play that married life would ‚Äúhave more crosses and sorrows than pleasure, freedom, or happiness‚ÄùNewcastle, Margaret Cavendish, et al. Paper Bodies: a Margaret Cavendish Reader. Broadview Press, 2000. Smith notes that despite her original position, Lady Happy consents to marrying the Prince. She believes this is a fluctuation on Cavendish's part between acknowledging marriage as inevitable and believing certain marriages are actually desirable. She notes that Cavendish appeared to have an agreeable marriage to her husband but also notes that he was a large source of her reputation and without her marriage to him she could not have supported her lifestyle.  Utopia  The utopian nature of life within the convent, Bonin argues, are highlighted by the way that life in the convent is presented as a fundamentally different, and better, society. Cavendish suggests the convent's pleasures are inaccessible, and even inconceivable to those positioned within the patriarchy. When Monsieur Courtly asks, \\"But is there no place where we may peak into the Convent?\\" Monsieur Adviser replies, \\"No, there are no Grates, but Brick and Stone-walls\\" (p. 19). Grates are absent by Lady Happy's decree, making her institution more insulated than the Female Academy, where perforated walls enable limited exchange. The convent is sealed not only from men, but from wives as well. As married women, Lady Amorous and Lady Vertue can only wonder about the delights within the convent. Their only glimpse of the convent comes through Madame Mediator, a widow who occupies a position inside and outside both the patriarchy and the convent. Madame Mediator has a limited capacity to describe the convent's rituals and pleasures to those firmly ensconced within the patriarchal economy: men, wives, and sometimes even the play's readers. But Madame Mediator's discourse provides only partial access to the utopian cloister. When Lady Vertue exclaims, \\"Well might I wish I might see and know, what Pleasures they enjoy,\\" Madame Mediator responds, \\"If you were there, you could not know all their Pleasure in a short time, for their Varieties will require a long time to know their several Changes\\" (p. 17). Here, the widow's language is enticingly vague, suggesting the convent's \\"Varieties\\" of pleasure are unimaginable to those doomed to live outside its walls.  Gender  Line Cottegnies has written on Cavendish from the perspective of Shakespeare in an article called \\"Gender and Cross-dressing in the Seventeenth Century: Margaret Cavendish Reads Shakespeare.\\" Cottegnies writes, ‚ÄúIn The Convent of Pleasure, Cavendish uses episodes and devices borrowed from several of Shakespeare‚Äôs comedies to reflect on transvestism and its implications.‚Äù In particular, Cottegnies believes Cavendish draws on the techniques of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure (1604), in which a Duke disguises himself as a friar and woos a novice, Isabella. Cottegnies found the endings of the two plays especially similar in the silences of both Lady Happy and Isabella when the Prince and the Duke reveal themselves in their respective plays. However, he found a difference in meaning between the two silences. Lady Happy is silent because she has finally yielded to passion instead of reason. Isabella is silent because she yields to the power of the Duke. External Links *The Convent of Pleasure by Margaret Cavendish.

Anderlecht plays in the Belgian First Division A and is the most successful Belgian football team in European competitions, with five trophies, as well as in the Belgian domestic league, with 34 championship wins. They have also won nine Belgian Cups and hold the record for most consecutive Belgian championship titles, winning five between the 1963‚Äì64 and 1967‚Äì68 seasons. Founded in 1908, the club first reached the highest level in Belgian football in 1921‚Äì22 and have been playing in the first division continuously since 1935‚Äì36 and in Europe since 1964‚Äì65. They won their first major trophy after World War II with a championship win in 1946‚Äì47. Since then, they have never finished outside the top six of the Belgian first division. They are ranked 14th amongst all-time UEFA club competition winners, tenth in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics continental Clubs of the 20th Century European ranking and were 41st in the 2012 UEFA team rankings. In 1986, they achieved their best UEFA ranking with a joint first place with Juventus. Anderlecht have been playing their matches in the Astrid Park in the municipality of Anderlecht since 1917. Their current stadium, Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, was first opened in 1983, and replaced the former Emile Vers√© Stadium. They play in purple and white outfits. They have long-standing rivalries with Club Brugge and Standard Li√®ge. History Founded as Sporting Club Anderlechtois on 27 May 1908 by a dozen football lovers at the Concordia caf√© (located in the Rue d'Aumale/Aumalestraat in the municipality of Anderlecht), the club beat Institut Saint-Georges in their first match, 11‚Äì8. They joined the official competition in 1909‚Äì10, starting at the lowest level in the Belgian football league system, then the third provincial division. In 1912‚Äì13, they gained promotion to the second-higher level of football, then named the Promotion. After only one season at that level, the championships were suspended due to World War I, and resumed in 1919‚Äì20. With the popularity of the team increasing, Anderlecht had moved to a new stadium in the Astrid Park in 1917 (then known as Meir Park). They baptized the stadium Stade Emile Vers√© in honor of the club's first major patron, the industrialist Emile Vers√©. At the end of the 1920‚Äì21 season, Anderlecht were promoted to the first division for the first time in their history. In the next 14 seasons, Anderlecht were relegated four times (1923, 1926, 1928 and 1931) and promoted four times (1924, 1927, 1929, 1935), earning themselves the mockery of local rival clubs Union Saint-Gilloise and Daring Club de Bruxelles, who nicknamed them the \\"lift club\\". In 1933, 25 years after their formation, the club changed their name to Royal Sporting Club Anderlechtois. Since their promotion in 1935, Anderlecht has remained at the top level of football. With Jef Mermans, a striker signed from K Tubantia FC in 1942 for a record fee of 125,000 Belgian francs, Anderlecht won their first league title in 1947. Their success increased in the following years as they won six more titles between 1949‚Äì50 and 1955‚Äì56 (winning three consecutive titles twice) and two more in 1958‚Äì59 and 1961‚Äì62. In the 1960s, under the coaching of Pierre Sinibaldi and then of Andreas Beres, the club even won five titles in a row (from 1963‚Äì64 to 1967‚Äì68), which is still a Belgian league record. The star of this team was Paul Van Himst, topscorer in 1965, 1967 and 1969 and Belgian Golden Shoe winner in 1960, 1961, 1965 and 1974. Anderlecht played in the first European Champion Clubs' Cup in 1955‚Äì56, and lost both legs of their tie against V√∂r√∂s Lobogo. They had to wait until the 1962‚Äì63 season to win their first European tie, with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Real Madrid, which followed a 3‚Äì3 draw in Spain. For the first time, they advanced to the second round, where they beat CSKA Sofia before losing to Dundee in the quarter-finals. In the 1969‚Äì70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Anderlecht lost in the final against Arsenal. Between 1975 and 1984, Anderlecht only won one championship but they achieved considerable European success: they won the 1975‚Äì76 and 1977‚Äì78 European Cup Winners' Cups against West Ham United and Austria Wien respectively, as well as the two subsequent European Super Cups. The 1982‚Äì83 season was a noteworthy season for the club for numerous reasons: former Anderlecht favourite Paul Van Himst was named the new coach, they won the 1982‚Äì83 UEFA Cup and the rebuilding of the club stadium began. But in the domestic league, Anderlecht had to settle for second place behind Standard. Their bid to retain the UEFA Cup in 1983‚Äì84 failed at the final hurdle against English side Tottenham Hotspur. Anderlecht reached the final controversially by beating another English side, Nottingham Forest, with a debatable extra time penalty to win 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. It was later found Anderlecht had bribed the referee the equivalent of ¬£27,000 to ensure passage to the final. After three-second-place finishes in a row, the Purple and Whites secured an easy 18th title in 1984‚Äì85, 11 points ahead of Club Brugge. In 1985‚Äì86, Anderlecht won the championship again, but this time after a two-legged play-off against Club Brugge. Anderlecht won their 20th championship on the last matchday of the 1986‚Äì87 season. They then lost key players Franky Vercauteren, Enzo Scifo (transferred in the summer of 1987) and Juan Lozano (heavily injured in a game at KSV Waregem a few months earlier). A weakened team coached by Raymond Goethals finished only fourth in 1988 behind Club Brugge, KV Mechelen and Royal Antwerp, but they nonetheless managed to lift the Belgian Cup for the sixth time in club history after a 2‚Äì0 victory over Standard Li√®ge, with goals by Luc Nilis and Eddie Krnƒçeviƒá. The next year, Anderlecht retained the trophy with goals by Eddie Krncevic and Milan Jankoviƒá (again with a 2‚Äì0 win over Standard), but finished second in the championship. After his second cup win, Goethals left for Bordeaux in the French Ligue 1. During the 1990s, Anderlecht reached one more European final, the 1990 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, which they lost to Italian club Sampdoria. The club then declined in European competitions, with the 1990‚Äì91 and 1996‚Äì97 UEFA Cup quarter-finals their best results. In national competition, they won four championship titles and a cup. During the 2000s, Anderlecht secured five more Belgian champion titles, reaching a total of 29 titles in 2007, in addition to one more cup victory. In the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Champions League, they qualified for the first time to the second round, then another group stage, where they finished third in their group behind Real Madrid and Leeds United. In 2009‚Äì10, the Purple and Whites won their 30th Belgian league title, while in the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League, Anderlecht made history by becoming the first Belgian team to finish the group stage of a European competition with the maximum number of points, dominating group opposition Lokomotiv Moscow, Sturm Graz and AEK Athens. They were also the only team of that year's Europa League to achieve this feat. On 6 May 2012, Anderlecht won their 31st Belgian championship, while on 22 July, they won their tenth Belgian Super Cup. Colours and badge Anderlecht colours are purple and white, and the club's home kit is generally purple with white trim, though they did wear a black and purple home kit in the 2005‚Äì06 season, and a grey in the 2007‚Äì08 season. In the beginning, purple was the main colour of the shirts. The motto of Anderlecht (\\"Mens sana in corpore sano\\") is written on its badge as are the three letters \\"SCA\\", referring to the initial name of the club (Sporting Club Anderlechtois). A crown was added in 1933 following the name change to Royal Sporting Club Anderlechtois. Anderlecht's colours inspired those of Al Ain FC in the United Arab Emirates. Stadium Constant Vanden Stock Stadium Anderlecht play their home matches at the lotto park stadium located within the Astrid Park in the municipality of Anderlecht. It currently has a capacity of 21,500 places.Een nationaal stadion stamt uit de koloniale tijd erasmix.be, 15 may 2013 The works should start in 2011 and last two years. Anderlecht has been playing in the Astrid Park since the building of the Emile Vers√© Stadium in 1917. The stadium was completely rebuilt in 1983 and it was renamed in honour of the then chairman Constant Vanden Stock. Prior to 1917, the club has played on a ground in the current Rue du Serment/Eedstraat for a couple of years since 1908, then in a stadium located Rue Verheydenstraat (now Rue D√©mosth√®nestraat). In 2013 the stadium was refreshed, installing new scoreboards and advertising strips along the perimeter of the pitch in accordance with UEFA regulations for the Champions League. ColosseoEAS was chosen as the provider for the ultra-modern LED strips and their controllers. In July 2019 the new owner Marck Couke sold the name to the firm Lotto, and has changed the name to Lotto Park Stadium. Anderlecht were due to move to the 60,000 capacity Eurostadium upon its expected completion in 2019. The Eurostadium will also be home of the Belgium national team and host fixtures in UEFA Euro 2020. However, during the years that followed, the project was plagued by numerous political delays. In February 2017, Anderlecht eventually pulled out of the project. Supporters The club has had the highest average attendance in the Belgian First Division for ten years, until 2004‚Äì05. Anderlecht supporters hail from all over the country and only a minority come from the Brussels Capital Region. Anderlecht counts 77 fan clubs, of which 5 are abroad (one in France, one in Poland, one in Texas, USA, one in Montreal, Canada and one in Sunderland, England). Rivals Anderlecht's main rivals are Standard Liege and Club Brugge.

Collins (1916 ‚Äì October 30, 1994) was a Republican member of the Ohio General Assembly. A former school teacher from Ironton, Ohio, Collins initially ran for the Ohio House of Representatives, winning a seat in 1946, and was reelected in 1948. He opted to move to the Ohio Senate in 1950, winning a seat to represent much of Appalachian Ohio. He won reelection in 1952, 1954, and 1956. In 1958, Collins opted for a fifth term, but lost to Democrat J. Sherman Porter, a radio personality from Gallipolis. However, he opted again to run in 1962, after Ohio Senate terms grew to four years. He won, and was again seated in 1963 to the Seventh/Eighth District, and would go forth to serve as Chairman of the Education Committee. Following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Collins was elected to the new 18th District in 1966, and reelected in 1968. Following redistricting in 1972, Collins found himself drawn out of his current district and into another. With the district he currently lived in not up for reelection until 1974, Collins opted to relinquish his Senate seat instead of running in the new district and instead seek a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. He was successful, and was seated in the House for 1973. Just two years into his House tenure, Collins again opted to run for the Senate, challenging incumbent and fellow Republican Harry Armstrong in the 1974 primary. In an upset, he narrowly defeated Armstrong to take the nomination, and went on to win the general election. He won reelection in 1978, and again in 1982. Up for reelection again in 1986, Collins initially was not considered vulnerable. However, surmounting ethics problems created an opening for his Democratic opponent, Jan Michael Long. In the end, Long defeated Collins in an upset, ending his 22-year career in the Senate. Following his defeat, Collins returned to Ironton to his family mining company. He died on October 30, 1994, at the age of 82.

which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or firm to be the sole provider of a good or service; potential competitors are excluded from the market by law, regulation, or other mechanisms of government enforcement. As a form of coercive monopoly, government-granted monopoly is contrasted with a coercive monopoly or an efficiency monopoly, where there is no competition but it is not forcibly excluded. Amongst forms of coercive monopoly it is distinguished from government monopoly or state monopoly (in which government agencies hold the legally enforced monopoly rather than private individuals or firms) and from government-sponsored cartels (in which the government forces several independent producers to partially coordinate their decisions through a centralized organization). Advocates for government- granted monopolies often claim that they ensure a degree of public control over essential industries, without having those industries actually run by the state. Opponents often criticize them as political favors to corporations. Government-granted monopolies may be opposed by those who would prefer free markets as well as by those who would prefer to replace private corporations with public ownership.  History  Under mercantilist economic systems, European governments with colonial interests often granted large and extremely lucrative monopolies to companies trading in particular regions, such as the Dutch East India Company. Today, government-granted monopolies may be found in public utility services such as public roads, mail, water supply, and electric power, as well as certain specialized and highly regulated fields such as education and gambling. In many countries lucrative natural resources industries, especially the petroleum industry, are controlled by government- granted monopolies. Franchises granted by governments to operate public transit through public roads are another example. Patent A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a state or national government to an inventor or his/her assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for a public disclosure of an invention. The procedure for granting patents, the requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims defining the invention which must be new, inventive, and useful or industrially applicable. In many countries, certain subject areas are excluded from patents, such as business methods and mental acts. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission.Patents: Frequently Asked Questions , World Intellectual Property Organization, Retrieved on 22 February 2009 Copyright Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.  Trademark  A trademark or trade mark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, business organization, or other legal entity to identify that the products or services to consumers with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source, and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities. Trademarks can act as a form of consumer protection that lowers the transaction costs between a buyer and seller who are not personally acquainted. \\\\- Subheading: The Economic Function of Trademarks p 166 Directly mandated Governments have granted monopolies to forms of copy prevention. In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, for example, the proprietary Macrovision copy prevention technology is required for analog video recorders. Though other forms of copy prevention aren't prohibited, requiring Macrovision effectively gives it a monopoly and prevents more effective copy prevention methods from being developed.  Background of the role of government  The theory of rent seeking - that is, artificially created socially harmful competition for scarcity due to scarcity - can be caused by monopolies, foreign trade restrictions and state subsidies. Governments can also create monopolies in order to reduce inefficiency of market as: scarcity of resources, reduced wealth-creation, lost government revenue, heightened income inequality, incomplete markets. The reason also can be simply as economies of scale, as well as the government can use its power to gather influence on the market by regulation. Companies can also cause rent seeking: a company has a monopoly power ‚Äì there is no other competitor on the market ‚Äì then the company can limit the amount produced, so creating scarcity. Therefore, it can raise the price in principle, so it can earn more than its costs, or what other factors could make. While monopolies, for example, can be considered a market failure as prices rise and output falls, monopoly creation is not always a strict market phenomena. Costs of government policies sometimes exceed benefits. This may occur because of incentives facing voters, government officials, and government employees, because of actions by special interest groups that can impose costs on the general public, or because social goals other than economic efficiency are being pursued. Government granted monopolies comprise a fair portion of monopolized industries.  Natural monopolies  A natural monopoly is when a company can serve the market most efficient way. This is usually due to fixed costs and variable costs. If the fixed costs are very high, it will result in it not being effective for more than one company on the market. For example, if we consider the electricity supply of a city, it is not worthwhile for anyone to build a second tram network. Since the (fixed) cost of network construction is too high, the expected return is not worth the investment. (Of course, if not only one company can supply the wires but anyone, then the fixed cost will disappear and competition can be realized.) It follows from a significant proportion of fixed costs that, in the case of a natural monopoly, the company provides a declining phase of the average cost curve. According to Arnold Harberger the loss of deadweight from monopolies in the US manufacturing industry is only 0.1% of GNP, so the real problem is not the existence of monopoly. The real problem is the social costs. These are not only the amount of deadweight loss and the cost of lobbying companies, but also the efforts that consumers make to prevent this. Indirect costs that are caused by rent seeking in other markets should also be taken into account. For example, if there is a need for more economists because of lobbying activities, the cost of not having many other professions or the cost of competing in offices for bribes. Interestingly, however, bribes alone are not a social cost, just a transfer from certain groups (renters) to other groups (clerks). In the case of natural monopolies in private hands, regulation can be introduced to break monopolies. The government can regulate prices in certain sectors where natural monopolies develop. This can be done directly by setting the price (for example, the price of rail or gas) or by regulating the return (for example, in the case of telephone services). Whatever method is used, the goal is to lower prices to cost levels. By reducing the price, the rent seeking and the deadweight loss are also reduced or eliminated. In addition to natural monopolies, there are monopolies created by companies themselves through acquisitions and mergers. They do it due to the fact that in addition to decreasing average costs (economies of scale), there may be other reasons for this. There is no rent seeking in the race because the companies offer each other until the prices exceed the costs. Their purpose is to agree on a higher price, thus dividing the annuity. However, they cannot trust each other either - in such a cartel, in the short term, each company has the interest of reducing the price, acquiring the customers of others, and thus getting close to all annuities. This is the easiest way for companies to solve this distrust when they unite and then share the annuity in proportion to the shares. Preventing such cases is a competition policy that prohibits the creation of price cartels and only allows mergers if it does not entail the risk of a monopoly power.  Alternative interpretation  Dennis Thompson notes, \\"Corruption is bad not because money and benefits change hands, and not because of the motives of participants, but because it privatizes valuable aspects of public life, bypassing processes of representation, debate, and choice.\\" Criticism Opponents of government-granted monopoly often point out that such a firm is able to set its pricing and production policies without fear of breeding potential competition. They argue that this causes inefficiencies in the market place, such as unnecessarily high prices to consumers for the good or service being supplied. It has been argued that government-imposed price caps might avert this problem.

Ada served as the first Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from January 9, 1978, until January 11, 1982, under Carlos S. Camacho, the territory's first governor. Ada is credited with spearheading the construction of much of the modern infrastructure in the Northern Mariana Islands, including Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport, the Commonwealth Ports Authority, and the Northern Marianas College. Early life Francisco Ada was born on September 26, 1934. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands In 1969, Ada, who was 35 years old at the time, became the district administrator of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. This was the highest-ranking office in the Northern Mariana Islands at the time. Much of Ada's efforts as an administrator focused on the potential of air travel as a tool of economic growth in the Mariana Islands. He laid the groundwork for the modern Saipan International Airport by acting on the advice of airport consultant Leigh Fisher and accepting grants made available through the National Airport Airways Development Act. Ada spearheaded the creation of an \\"airline technical committee,\\" which promoted cooperation between the government and the private sector to promote the creation of the new airport. During this period, Ada established the Mariana Islands Airport Authority, which is now called the Commonwealth Ports Authority. Ada next became the deputy resident commissioner to the Northern Marianas Islands in 1976. He also served as the delegate for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands government to the South Pacific Commission, assistant district administrator, a member of the Saipan Municipal Congress, and a member of the Mariana Islands District Legislature. Lieutenant Governor In 1978, the Northern Mariana Islands became a commonwealth in political union with the United States, resulting in a new constitution and an elected governor's office. In 1977, Carlos S. Camacho and Francisco Ada were elected the Northern Mariana Islands' first governor and lieutenant governor respectively. Governor Camacho would later call Ada \\"a good man\\" and \\"very loyal\\" during their tenure in office. Ada served as lieutenant governor, leaving office on January 11, 1982. He was succeeded as by Pedro Agulto Tenorio. Post-Lt. Governor=Later career Within the private sector, Ada worked as the general manager and vice president of Triple J Enterprises Inc. On October 14, 2002, former Governor Juan N. Babauta signed Saipan Local Law 13-10, which renamed Saipan International Airport as Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport in honor of Ada. At the time of the signing former Governor Babauta praised Ada's contributions to the airport saying, \\"There is no doubt that due to the Honorable Francisco C. Ada's tireless contributions in the planning, development and completion of the Saipan International Airport, the Commonwealth's economic future was forever transformed.\\" The new, modern airport was dedicated and renamed in honor of Ada in 2005. Ada told the NMI media during the dedication ceremony, \\"But the name was secondary to what the effort stands for, which is working together with the federal government [to achieve our goals].\\" Death Francisco Ada died on March 2, 2010, at Commonwealth Health Center in Garapan, Saipan, at the age of 75. Ada had suffered from a lengthy illness. He was survived by his wife, Ines Seman Ada, and their seven children, many of whom have held positions in CNMI public life. His children are - MaryLou Ada, former director of the former Commonwealth Development Authority; Eloise Furey, former member of the Northern Marianas College Board of Regents; Lillian Tenorio, an attorney; Esther Ada, internal auditor of the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund; Frank C. Ada Jr., chief of classification and compensation for the commonwealth's Office of Personnel Management; Dr. Norma Ada and Luciana Schubert. Ada received a state funeral, which is required for all top government officials, including governors and lieutenant governors, by the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands. Ada's son, Frank Ada Jr., told the Saipan Tribune that a state funeral was \\"fitting for what my father contributed to the government of the Northern Marianas and Micronesia.\\" Lieutenant Governor Eloy Inos stated that Ada's state funeral was \\"in recognition of his dedicated service to our people as our first lieutenant governor.\\" Inos also ordered all American and Northern Mariana Islands flags lowered to half staff. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted separate resolutions praising Ada's contributions to the political and social sectors of the Northern Mariana Islands since 1976, when it became a commonwealth. Ada's state funeral was held on Wednesday, March 10, 2010, at the Pedro P. Tenorio Multi-Purpose Center in Susupe, Saipan. The funeral was attended by four of the Northern Mariana Islands' governors - Carlos S. Camacho and his wife, former First Lady Lourdes Camacho; Pedro P. Tenorio, and his wife, Sophie; Juan N.

He is portrayed by actor John Lithgow. The character has received universal acclaim, with Lithgow winning a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him #34 of their \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\".  Character overview  Arthur Mitchell is portrayed as an unassuming deacon and family man -- who for 30 years has been living a double life as a serial killer. In the series, FBI agent Frank Lundy dubs him the \\"Trinity Killer\\" because of a recurring pattern of three killings. The series shows that Mitchell's first murder is of a young woman in a bathtub, killed by slicing her femoral artery with a straight razor while putting her in a choke hold, and holding up a small mirror so that he can see her face as she dies. His second victim is a married mother of two, whom he kidnaps. He forces her, by threatening her husband and children if she does not comply, to fall to her death from a carefully selected abandoned building. His third victim is a father of two, whom he bludgeons to death with a hammer. At each site he places a small sample of his sister's ashes, and arranges the victim's arm to point at the ash. He has repeated this cycle in different cities all over the United States (Raleigh, North Carolina, San Francisco, Louisville, Detroit, and Richmond). Frank Lundy's superiors are skeptical about the existence of the Trinity Killer, leading him to launch a private inquiry into the murders that eluded him during his FBI career. It is later discovered that, before these three, the Trinity Killer also kidnaps a young boy whom he dresses in cowboy pajamas and convinces to play with a train set in a recreation of his childhood. Following this, he will bury the boy alive in cement at a Four Walls' building site. These killings were not connected to the pattern until shortly before Mitchell's death, because the boys were reported as missing rather than dead. At first, Dexter Morgan is fascinated by Mitchell's efficient killing methods and apparent ability to balance his familial responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer.  Family  When Mitchell was 10, he spied on his older sister Vera taking a shower; when she saw him, she was so startled that she slipped and fell through the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and bleeding to death. His parents blamed him for Vera's death. His mother committed suicide two years later by jumping out of a window. His father, already a heavy drinker, became an alcoholic and frequently beat his son during his drunken rages. Ultimately, his father was bludgeoned to death with a hammer - it is suggested by Mitchell himself. Mitchell re-enacts the death of his family in his murders: the young woman represents his sister, the married mother of two represents his mother, the father of two represents his father, and the boy represents Mitchell himself. Mitchell lives with his wife, Sally, and his teenaged children, Jonah and Rebecca. He has another, older daughter by a previous relationship: Christine Hill, who witnessed one of his murders as a child. He treats her like a shameful secret, forbidding her from contacting him and keeping her existence hidden from his other family. She tries unsuccessfully to win his love, going so far as to commit murder for him; she kills FBI agent Frank Lundy and wounds Dexter's adopted sister Debra to protect her father from the police. Her actions have the opposite of the intended effect, however: When he learns what she has done, Mitchell is enraged and tells her he wishes she had never been born. She commits suicide shortly afterward.  Story progression = Episode 37  In season four, Mitchell begins the cycle again, killing his victims at the original murder sites. Mitchell punishes himself after each murder: after killing the woman in the bathtub, he takes a shower in scalding hot water; after forcing a mother to fall to her death, he provokes a drunken man into beating him up.  Episode 40  FBI agent Frank Lundy comes out of retirement to hunt Trinity down, but is shot and killed just as he begins to close in on him. Lundy had theorized that Trinity was a loner who had no life outside killing. When Dexter goes to kill Trinity, he discovers that Trinity is a husband and father, as well as a prominent figure in a charitable Christian homebuilding organization. He uses this organization to travel around the country to cover for his murder spree, and (it is later learned) as a dump site for the first victim in his cycle.  Episode 43  Dexter is conflicted over whether to kill Mitchell or learn how he makes his family life work. Dexter, under the alias of Kyle Butler, befriends Mitchell and soon learns that, unlike Dexter, Mitchell apparently has no problem being himself with his family or expressing affection. He also witnesses Mitchell's strange, unpredictable personality; the same man who murders people with uncommon brutality starts crying when he and Dexter hit a deer, and is appalled at the idea of putting it out of its misery.  Episode 44  As Mitchell plans a trip to Tampa to build a house, Dexter concocts a plan to go to a meteorological convention to establish an alibi so he has a reason to be in Tampa as well. Mitchell reluctantly allows Dexter to tag along when Dexter claims he's done something terrible that only Mitchell can help him recover from. Dexter, hoping to redeem his murder of an innocent man, plans to murder the decidedly guilty Mitchell along the way. During their road trip, however, Mitchell pushes Dexter to admit his terrible deed, and Dexter claims to have killed someone in a hunting accident. This admission greatly affects Mitchell, who sees it as a sign of kinship. He takes Dexter to his old home and tells him that when he was 10, he startled his sister while spying on her in the shower; she fell and broke the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and bleeding to death. His mother later committed suicide by leaping off a building, leaving him in the care of his abusive father; Dexter conjectures that Mitchell bludgeoned his father to death, accounting for the third victim. For the remainder of the trip Mitchell exhibits sudden mood swings and irrational behavior. He keeps telling random people about his family members' deaths and stresses the need for confession, to the point that Dexter is actually worried that Mitchell might tell people about Dexter's previously mentioned murder. One morning, Dexter sneaks into Mitchell's room, intent on killing him, only to find him gone. Dexter tracks him to a construction site where Mitchell attempts suicide. Dexter reluctantly stops him, wanting to kill Mitchell himself. Dexter contemplates letting Mitchell fall to his death, but as he's about to let go, workers at the site come to help Dexter save him. Afterward, Mitchell has a newfound zest for life, believing God sent Dexter to save him.  Episode 45  As Dexter gets to know Mitchell, he learns that his would-be mentor is not the loving family man he appears to be; Mitchell dominates his wife, beats his son and keeps his daughter virtually imprisoned in her room. During Thanksgiving, Mitchell's son, Jonah, lashes out at his father, destroying his homebuilder's plaques and smashing his sister's urn. In a fit of rage, Mitchell almost strangles Jonah, but Dexter interferes, dragging him into the kitchen. Just as Dexter has Mitchell at his mercy, however, Mitchell's wife and daughter rush in to stop him.  Episodes 46 and 47  Dexter witnesses Mitchell kidnap a child, but is unable to stop him. Eventually Dexter tracks him down as he's about to bury the boy alive in drying concrete. Dexter saves the boy, but Mitchell escapes. After Mitchell learns from a news report that the boy is alive, and that Dexter didn't turn him in, he begins to become suspicious. As he tries to find Dexter he kills a man named Kyle Butler, and ultimately follows Dexter to the Miami Metro Police Department. There, he discovers Dexter's real name.  Episode 48  In the last episode of the season, \\"The Getaway\\", Dexter subdues Mitchell and prepares to kill him in the room where Mitchell had held the kidnapped child. Mitchell believes Dexter was sent by God to kill him, and claims that he had tried several times to stop killing, but found that he could not change his \\"path\\". He predicts a similar fate for Dexter: he tells Dexter \\"It's already over\\", the same thing he says to his victims before he kills them. Dexter then kills him with a hammer. It is revealed in the final scene of the episode that Mitchell killed Dexter's wife, Rita, in the bathtub of Dexter's house, and that he left Dexter's son Harrison in her blood, mirroring the childhood trauma that put Dexter on the path to becoming a serial killer.  Episode 52  Miami Metro detective Joey Quinn suspects Dexter of killing Rita, and he connects the dots as to the identity of Kyle Butler. Anxious to further his investigation, Quinn requests permission from Captain Maria LaGuerta, but she denies his request and orders him to leave Dexter alone. Undeterred, Quinn finds Jonah Mitchell amidst being relocated into witness protection with the rest of his family, and tries to show him a picture of Dexter so that Jonah can confirm whether or not it is \\"Kyle Butler\\". However, one of the FBI convoys manages to intercept Quinn's attempt before he succeeds, and so Quinn's query remains unanswered.  Episode 67  In the sixth season, Dexter hears news about the Mitchell family, who are now living in Nebraska: Mitchell's wife, Sally, and daughter, Rebecca, have been murdered in the same way as were Mitchell's victims. Dexter deduces that Jonah is the killer, and hunts him down. At first, Jonah claims his father killed them both, but later gets into a fight with Dexter, seemingly wanting to die by Dexter's hand. Confused, Dexter gets Jonah to confess that Rebecca actually committed suicide because their mother kept blaming the children for Mitchell's capture; upon finding her, Jonah flew into a fit of rage and killed his mother, bludgeoning her in the same manner that his father killed his victims. Dexter tells Jonah to forgive himself, and leaves.

In 1855, members of the Club, in conjunction with the Philadelphia Barge Club, built a one-story brick boathouse on rented land. The Club purchased a second boat, named Lucifer. After 1860, both boats were moved to a space rented from the Philadelphia Skating Club, which is now the Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club. At first, membership was limited to students enrolled at Penn, but the Club was not listed as a student organization of the University until 1867, when the University Barge Club won the Schuylkill Navy championship flag. Membership was later opened to Penn alumni and certain non- alumni. Although the Club was still affiliated with the University, it gradually began to cater more to non-students. As the Club's membership became dominated by Old Philadelphians from the upper-class aristocracy, student enthusiasm waned. In 1871, the Fairmount Park commission allowed the Club to build its own boathouse on Boathouse Row. In 1872, Penn students formed an alternative club, the College Boat Club, to cater to students and focus on preparing for intercollegiate competitions. In 1887, University Barge Club leased an additional upriver clubhouse for social functions called The Lilacs on the west bank of the Schuylkill. Today, while many of the University Barge Club's members are University of Pennsylvania graduates, the Club has no official affiliation with the University. University Barge Club is the sister club of Union Boat Club of Boston. For more than 60 years, the two sister clubs have held an annual interclub \\"UBC\\" regatta. History of the boathouse The boathouse, at #7-8 Boathouse Row, dates from 1871, and was greatly expanded in 1891. Originally, University Barge Club only occupied #7, while Philadelphia Barge Club occupied #8. In 1932, University Barge Club acquired #8 when Philadelphia Barge Club ceased operations.

The Romans never managed to conquer the peninsula proper, except Arabia Petraea. Initial contacts The volume of commerce between Rome and India via Red Sea and Arabian Sea was huge since the conquest of Egypt by the Romans in 30 BC, according to the historian Strabo: 120 Roman vessels sailed every year from Berenice Troglodytica and many times touched southern Arabia Felix on their travel to India, while doing the Spice Route.The Geography of Strabo published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1917 Mostly in order to secure the maritime route from piracy, the Romans organized an expedition under Aelius Gallus in which the port of Aden (then called Eudaemon) in southern Arabia was occupied temporarily. The Romans furthermore maintained a small legionary garrison in the Nabataean port of Leuke Kome (\\"meaning \\"the white village\\", located north of the Arabian port of Jeddah) in the 1st century in order to control the commerce of spices, according to the academic Theodor Mommsen (see Indo-Roman trade relations).Theodor Mommsen. The Provinces of the Roman Empire. Chapter X (Syria and the land of the Nabataeans) Frankincense and myrrh, two spices highly prized in antiquity as fragrances, could only be obtained from trees growing in southern Arabia, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Arab merchants brought these goods to Roman markets by means of camel caravans along the Incense Route. This Incense Route originally commenced at Shabwah in Hadhramaut, the easternmost kingdom of South Arabia, and ended at Petra. Strabo compared the immense traffic along the desert routes to that of an army. The Incense Route ran along the western edge of Arabia's central desert about 100 miles inland from the Red Sea coast. The Roman Pliny the Elder stated that the journey consisted of sixty-five stages divided by halts for the camels. Both the Nabataeans and the South Arabians grew tremendously wealthy through the transport of these goods destined for the Roman Empire. The Gallus Expedition The ruins of Old Marib, Yemen, besieged by the Romans in 25 BC. Gaius Aelius Gallus was the second praefectus Aegypti (governor of Roman Egypt) (), from 26 to 24 BC, during the reign of Augustus. Accounts of his expedition to Arabia Felix are given by Strabo,Strabo, xvi. p. 780-783. Cassius DioCassius Dio LIII, 29 and Pliny the ElderPliny the Elder, Nat. Hist. vi. 32.See also Charles Merivale, History of the Romans under the Empire, ch. 4; H. Kr√ºger, Der Feidzug des Aelius Gallus nach dem glucklichen Arabien unter Kaiser Augustus, 1862.. Strabo's account is particularly detailed,Strabo, xvi. p. 780-782; xvii. pp. 806, 816, 819. and derives most of its information from Aelius Gallus himself, who was a personal friend of Strabo.Strabo, ii. p. 118. Then part of the Kingdom of Saba æ, the area of modern-day Yemen was called Arabia Felix ( or 'Fortunate Arabia') by the Romans, reflecting its perceived prosperity. The success of the Sabaeans was based on their cultivation and trade of valuable spices and aromatics, including frankincense and myrrh. Irrigation of these crops was enabled by the Great Dam of Ma'rib. Strabo mentions that Ilasaros was the ruler of Hadhramaut at that time. Augustus commanded Gallus to undertake a military expedition to Arabia Felix in 26 BC, where he was to either conclude treaties making the Arabian people foederati (i.e. client states), or to subdue them if they resisted. According to Theodor Mommsen, Aelius Gallus sailed with 10,000 legionaries from Egypt and landed at Leuce Kome, a trading port of the Nabateans in the northwestern Arabian coast. Gallus' subsequent movements relied on a Nabataean guide called Syllaeus, who proved to be untrustworthy.Dio Cassius, liii. 29.Pliny, Natural History, vi. 32; vii. 28.Charles Merivale, History of the Romans under the Empire, ch. 34, 1864.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xv. 9. ¬ß3. As a result of Syllaeus' misdirections, the army took six months to reach Ma'rib, the Sabaean capital. Gallus besieged Ma'rib unsuccessfully for a week, before being forced to withdraw. Momsen ascribes this to a combination of disease, over-extended supply lines, and a tougher desert environment than the Romans had expected. Gallus' retreat to Alexandria was completed in sixty days. The supporting Roman fleet had more success: they occupied and destroyed the port of Eudaemon (modern Aden), securing the Roman merchant route to India. Trajan and the Arabia Petraea province A map of the Roman Empire shortly after Trajan's conquests of the kingdom of Nabataea, including Hegra in the interior. The province was soon reduced back to the line of limes Arabicus. The Nabateans maintained close relations with the Romans since their arrival in the southeastern Mediterranean area. Under Augustus they were a Roman client kingdom. When the emperor Trajan started his military expansions toward the east Rabbel II Soter, one of Rome's client kings, died. This event prompted the annexation of the Nabataean Kingdom, although the manner and the formal reasons for the annexation are unclear. Some epigraphic evidence suggests a military operation, with forces from Syria and Egypt. What is clear, however, is that by 107, Roman legions were stationed in the area around Petra and Bostra, as is shown by a papyrus (and other evidences) found in Egypt. The Roman Empire gained what became the province of Arabia Petraea (modern southern Jordan and north west Saudi Arabia).Map showing the Roman Arabia province under Trajan emperor The conquest of Arabia was not officially exulted until the completion of the Via Traiana Nova in 120's. This road extended down the center of the province from Bostra to Aqaba. It wasn't until the project was finished that coins, featuring Trajan's bust on the obverse and a camel on the reverse, appeared commemorating the acquisition of Arabia. These coins were minted until 115, at which time the Roman imperial focus was turning farther eastward. The road links not only Bostra and Aqaba, but also Petra and was continued by a \\"caravan road\\" south the coast of western Arabia until the port of Leuce Kome. Recently further evidence has been discovered that Roman legions occupied Mada'in Saleh in the Hijaz Mountains area of northwestern Arabia, increasing the extension of the \\"Arabia Petraea\\" province. Hadrian probably restructured the province after the Trajan expansion, reducing the area to nearly half the original size (at the west of what was called the Limes Arabicus) in order to better defend Arabia Petraea from raiders and enemies. The same process occurred in Caledonia, when he abandoned the Roman forts around Inchtuthil and the Gask Ridge and created Hadrian's Wall in Roman Britain (reducing the Roman-controlled area of Scotland). Under emperor Septimius Severus Arabia Petraea was expanded to include the Leja‚Äô and Jabal al-Druze, rough terrain south of Damascus, and also the birthplace of M. Julius Phillipus (Philip the Arab). Roman Arabia in the \\"Diocese of the East\\" (Dioecesis Orientis) at the beginning of the 5th century Indeed, the Romans found a powerful ally in the Arabs called Ghassanids, who moved from the area of Marib to southern Syria mainly in the 2nd century. The Ghassanids were the buffer zone against the other Bedouins penetrating Roman territory in those years. More accurately their kings can be described as phylarchs, native rulers of subject frontier states. Their capital was at Jabiyah in the Golan Heights. Geographically, the Ghassanid kingdom occupied much of Syria, Mount Hermon (Lebanon), Jordan and Palestine, and its authority extended via tribal alliances with other \\"Azdi\\" tribes all the way to the northern Hejaz as far south as Yathrib (Medina). Furthermore, precise Arab ancestry of the Roman emperor Philip the Arab is not known, since all sources give only the Latin names of him and his family members. However, having originated from the general area in which the Ghassanids settled, many historians consider he may have been of that origin. His being mentioned either as a Christian himself or at least tolerant of Christians would fit with his originating from a people which was in the process of Christianization at the time of his rule. Septimius Severus enlarged a province that was already huge. He then proceeded to enlarge the empire, through the conquest of Mesopotamia. The transfer of the Leja‚Äô and Jebel Dr≈´z seemed to have been part of a shrewd series of political acts on the emperor's part to consolidate control of the area before this conquest. Arabia became the ideological power base for Septemius Severus in the Roman Near East. Arabia became such a symbol of loyalty to Severus and the empire, according to Bowersock,G. W. Bowersock, \\"A Report on Arabia Provincia\\", The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 61, (1971), pp. 219-242 that during his war against Clodius Albinus, in Gaul, Syrian opponents propagated a rumour that the Third Cyrenaica legion controlling Arabia Petraea had defected. That it would matter to an issue in France/Gaul that a single legion in a backwater province on the other side of the empire would rebel indicates the political sway that Arabia had amassed. Not a land of significant population, resources, or even strategic position, it had become a bedrock of Roman culture. That it was an Eastern Roman culture didn't seem to dilute its effectiveness in matters in the west. It is precisely because Arabia Petraea had so little that it was able to define itself as Roman and that spurred its loyalty to Imperial Rome. Another example of the loyalty to Rome of the Arab tribes of northern Arabia was Lucius Septimius Odaenathus. He was \\"the son of Lucius Septimius Herod (HairƒÅn), the senator and chief of Tadmor, the son of Vaballathus (Wahballath), the son of Nasor\\"Gawlikowski, Michel, \\"Les princes de Palmyre\\", Syria 62 (1985) 251-61. and was the romanized Arab ruler of Palmyra and later his wife Zenobia and son Vaballathus ruled the short lived Palmyrene Empire. Odenatus, in the second half of the 3rd century, succeeded in recovering the Roman East from the Persians and restoring it to the Empire. With Emperor Diocletian's restructuring of the empire in 284‚Äì305, Arabia Petraea province was enlarged to include parts of modern-day Palestine. Arabia after Diocletian was a part of the Diocese of the East, which was part of the Praetorian prefecture of the East and was largely Christian. The province was conquered by the Arab Muslims under the Caliph Umar in the early 7th century: the Legio III Cyrenaica was destroyed defending Bosra in 630, ending the Roman presence in Arabia.L.

Existing=Starke alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301 Alt.) is a alternate route of US 301\\\\. It was established in 2019, and serves as a bypass of the mainline through downtown Starke. It is also designated as the main truck route for traffic headed north towards Jacksonville. The highway is built to freeway standards, with only two interchanges with State Road 100 (SR 100) and SR 16.https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/traffic/after-three-years- us-301-bypass-around-starke-officially- opens/77-5a601dd5-39ef-4059-84ec-927f1aebf09f It carries the hidden Florida Department of Transportation designation of State Road 223\\\\. Statesboro bypass U.S. Route 301 Bypass (US 301 Byp.), which is entirely concurrent with the unsigned State Route 73 Bypass (SR 73 Byp.), is a four-lane bypass of US 301\\\\. It travels south-to-north in the southern and eastern parts of the city of Statesboro. US 301 Byp., along with US 25 Byp. and SR 67 Byp., makes up the Veterans Memorial Parkway, which forms a near circle around the city. The bypass begins in the southwestern part of the city at the intersection with US 25/US 301/SR 73, as well as US 25 Byp./SR 67 Byp. US 301 Byp., SR 67 Byp., and SR 73 Byp. travel southeast and east along the perimeter of Georgia Southern University. They follow the perimeter of the university, turning northeast towards Fair Road (SR 67), where it breaks off from the university perimeter and turns northward. Here, SR 67 Byp. ends, while US 301 Byp. and SR 73 Byp. continue. After turning north, the bypass intersects Northside Drive (US 80/SR 26), East Main Street (SR 24), and finally East Parrish Street (US 301/SR 73). The entire length of US 301 Byp. and SR 73 Byp. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. The Veterans Memorial Parkway was commissioned in 1993. Both US 25 Byp. and US 301 Byp. were completed at the same time as two-lane highways. Several years later, US 25 Byp. was widened to become a four-lane divided highway. In March 2007, work began on the widening of US 301 Byp. The bypass was completed in October 2008. US 301 Byp., commonly referred to simply as \\"the bypass\\", has become one of the most congested roads in Statesboro. The widening of the road, which was supposed to be completed by 2006, was not completed due to a faulty contractor. A new contractor was hired by the Georgia Department of Transportation, and work began in March 2007. The bypass has become an attractive place for new businesses, and has been crucial in the growth and expansion of the greater Statesboro area. Florence truck routeRocky Mount business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 301A through downtown Rocky Mount, via Church Street and briefly on Tarboro Road. Halifax business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 301A through downtown Halifax, via King and David Streets. Petersburg alternate route View south along US 301 Alt. in Petersburg U.S. Route 301 Alternate is an alternate route of US 301 through Petersburg, mostly running along South Sycamore Street. It begins at a three way intersection from Crater Road (US 301) and Walnut Boulevard which veers diagonal to the left as Sycamore Street. Before reaching downtown Petersburg, US Alt. 301 crosses Interstate 85/US 460 with no access. In the downtown area, it joins northbound US 1, eastbound Business US 460 and SR 36 on a concurrency along Wythe Street while southbound US 301 Alt. uses Washington Street on a one-way pair. Alt. 301 turns left onto Adams Street along with US 1 and ending at Bank/Bollingbrook Streets (US 301). Bowling Green business loop US 301 Bus. northbound at SR 2 and SR 207 Bus. in Bowling Green U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1970, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Bowling Green, via Richmond Turnpike, Main Street, and Broaddus Avenue. The route begins at an interchange with the Bowling Green Bypass (US 301) at a single connecting road, where Richmond Turnpike becomes South Main Street. VA 2 continues from the overlap with mainline US 301 to an overlap with the business loop. At the intersection of Milford and Chase Streets (VSR 619), South Main Street becomes North Main Street, which runs through the Bowling Green Historic District. North Main Street makes a slight northwest curve at the intersection with Sunset Drive. The intersection of West and East Broaddus Avenues is where US BUS 301 makes a right turn while VA 2 continues north towards Fredericksburg, and VA BUS 207 heads west to VA 207. US BUS 301 heads east along East Broaddus as it runs from a residential to a sparsely commercial developed area until it curves to the southeast and finally terminates at US 301, the northern terminus of the Bowling Green Bypass at A.P. Hill Boulevard. Former=Dade City truck route Truck U.S. Route 98-301 was a truck bypass of the concurrency of U.S. Routes 98 & 301 in Dade City, Florida. The road is also unsigned State Road 533. In February 2007, this section was converted into the main branch of the US 98-301 concurrency. Dade City business route Business U.S. Route 98-301 was the main line of the concurrency of U.S. Routes 98 & 301 in Dade City, Florida until February 2007. The road was also unsigned State Road 35, State Road 39, and State Road 700. SR 39 shields turned up during an FDOT resurfacing project of the former route. Ocala alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate in Ocala is now County Road 200A. It was also former State Road 200A. The first segment is named 20th Street and begins at US 301 in Ocala north of a railroad bridge. Upon reaching Northeast Eighth Road, former US ALT 301 becomes Jacksonville Road, a street name it carries until it terminates with US 301 in Citra. Sylvania business loop U.S. Route 301 Business (US 301 Bus.), the one segment of SR 73 that's not concurrent with US 301, was a business route of US 301\\\\. It began at the US 301/SR 21/SR 73 Loop bypass around western Sylvania. The highway, which was named West Ogeechee Street curved northeast in front of a former segment of the road which also leads to a former segment of SR 21, then passes\\\\d the northbound frontage road for the Sylvania Bypass. It traveled straight northeast and southwest along random commercial development until it curved to the east and encountered the intersection of SR 21 Bus. (Mims Road) with turning ramps at both the northwest and northeast corners. The SR 21 Bus./SR 73 concurrency begins and the two highways travel to the east for just over , part of which uses a bridge over a railroad line. The road divided before approaching Main Street and City Hall, where SR 21 Bus. turns south on South Main Street, while SR 73 turns north on North Main Street. Main Street itself is divided by a town green from Telephone Avenue to halfway between Ogeechee Street and W.T. Sharpe Drive, while East Ogeechee Street becomes an unmarked city street. After the intersection with W.T. Sharpe Drive, SR 73 branches off to the northeast, while Singleton Avenue branches off to the northwest. North Main Street becomes much more rural north of here, and is sparsely lined with large suburban houses, although one local lawn mower dealership can be found on the southwest corner of SR 73 and Habersham Road across from Torrington Road. Two more local intersections are passed before the route encounters the frontage the Sylvania Bypass once again, and SR 73 rejoins US 301 on its way to South Carolina, while SR 73 Loop ends. When SR 73 Loop was established in 1970, US 301 was routed onto it. US 301's former path through the city (on SR 73) was redesignated as US 301 Bus. In 2017, it was decommissioned. Lumberton alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301A) was established around 1954, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Lumberton, via Second Street and Pine Street. In 1960 it was renumbered to US 301 Business. Lumberton business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 301A through downtown Lumberton, via Second Street and Pine Street. Sometime on April 1971, it was decommissioned, leaving NC 42 and NC 72. Fayetteville alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301A) was established around 1952, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Fayetteville, via Gillespie Street and Clinton Road. In 1960 it was renumbered to US 301 Business. Fayetteville business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 301A through downtown Fayetteville, via Gillespie Street and Clinton Road. On January 1975, it was decommissioned. Wilson alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301A) was established around 1954, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Wilson, via Goldsboro Street and Herring Avenue. In 1960 it was renumbered to US 301 Business. Wilson business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 301A through downtown Wilson, via Goldsboro Street and Herring Avenue. In 1963 it was decommissioned; partly replaced by NC 42 along Herring Avenue. Elm City business loop U.S. Route 301 Business was established in 1960 and followed the old mainline route of US 301 through Elm City, via Elm City Road, before its bypass was built in 1958. On November 1970, it was decommissioned. Rocky Mount alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301A) was established around 1954, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Rocky Mount, via Church Street. In 1960 it was renumbered to US 301 Business. Halifax alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301A) was established around 1952, it replaced the old mainline US 301 through downtown Halifax, via King and David Streets. In 1960 it was renumbered to US 301 Business. Delaware truck route U.S. Route 301 Truck was a truck bypass of a segment of U.S. Route 301 in New Castle County, Delaware. It was created in the 1980s to provide a truck bypass of the St. Georges Bridge for US 301 when structural issues with the bridge forced a weight restriction. U.S. Route 301 Truck followed Delaware Route 71 and Delaware Route 896 north from US 301 in Mount Pleasant. It then crossed over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on the Summit Bridge. The truck route continued north on DE 896 to Glasgow, where it turned east on U.S. Route 40 and followed it to State Road, where it ended at U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 301. In 1992, US 301 was realigned to head north over the Summit Bridge to end at US 40 in Glasgow. This rerouting made Truck US 301 obsolete, however signs remained until 2001 along US 40.

He was a leading figure of the thriving Danish scene during the years around World War II--a period which has been labelled the Golden Age of Danish Jazz--and he is considered to be one of the most significant and original jazz musicians of his day. Mathisen's main source of inspiration was Fats Waller, both his piano play and his singing, but the later years of his career saw some bebop influence. His most famous tracks are \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"To Be or Not to Be\\". His nickname is a reference to his first name as well as MGM's mascot Leo the Lion. He is also remembered for his characteristic appearance with his flat, centrally parted hair, his thin moustache and, most notably, his fondness of large cigars. Biography=Early life and career Leo Mathisen was born in Copenhagen in 1906. He worked in a record shop, listened to records and tried to copy the virtuosic piano playing that he heard. After completing a merchant education, he started working professionally as a pianist in restaurant Arena and with Kai Ewans' band in Restaurant Adlon. The same year he also recorded his first album, The More We Are Together, in collaboration with Victor Cornelius. From 1927 to 1928 he was also part of a trio with Otto Lington and Anker Skjoldborg. From 1928 through 1931 he performed with Adrian Rollini's orchestra Germany and Sweden and with Max Lefkos' band in Germany and Sweden. With own bands In 1936 Mathisen formed his own band and until 1952 he led various acclaimed orchestras which performed in restaurants in Copenhagen and toured in Scandinavia after the end of World War II also in Germany. They also served as backup bands for various popular singers. Among the members of his band were Erik Parker, Henry Hagemann and John Steffensen while the trumpeter J√∏rgen Ryg joined the ensemble in the years after the war. During the war, a time which has been labelled as the Golden Age of Danish Jazz, he reached huge popularity, particularly at the M√ºnchen establishment where he performed regularly for several years during the Occupation of Denmark. When he was forbidden to perform in English, he resorted to scat singing with a distinctive Copenhagen-English sound. From 1951 he performed as a solo pianist around Denmark but in spring 1953 he retired from music altogether due to health problems. He died in 1969 and is interred on the Mariebjerg Cemetery in Gentofte in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. Works Mathisen recorded numerous albums with his band, often with his own compositions. His main source of inspiration was Fats Waller, both in his piano play and in his singing, and particularly his recordings from 1941 to 1943 are considered to be among the swing music's finest. His most famous songs are \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"To Be or Not to Be\\". With larger orchestras he recorded tracks such as \\"Long Shadows\\", which is a typical example of his original arrangements. In 1952 he retired from music due to health problems. Mathisen also recorded popular hits of his time such as Lionel Hampton's \\"Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\\", \\"Five Minutes More\\", \\"Near Yo\\" and \\"Makin' Whoopee\\". With Erik Parkerm he also created Danish lyrics to songs such as De 24 R√∏vere that Fats Waller recorded in 1941 and Jack McVea's \\"The Key's in the Mailbox\\". In films Leo Mathisen appears as himself in the films 5 raske piger (1933), 7-9-13 (1934), Mit liv er musik (1944) and Teatertosset (1944). His music is featured in the films Der var engang en krig (1966), Midt i en jazztid (1969) and in I Tvillingernes tegn (1975). He is also the subject of the biographical 1986 film Take it Easy, where he is played by Eddie Skoller. He is also mentioned in the Danish series Matador episode 5 as an up-and-coming pianist.

However, also because of the sameness, they are often misdiagnosed for each other, as migralepsy rarely occurs. Signs and symptoms General symptoms of migralepsy are: * Flashes of light * Geometric or animate forms * Visual hallucinations * Vomiting * Headache * Blindness * Loss of consciousness * Convulsions Cause The connection between migraines and epileptic seizures is currently being researched and not much is known. Patients have been shown to have had migraines long before developing epileptic symptoms, creating the possibility of severe cases of migraines creating epilepsy.\\"Pathomechanisms of persistent aura\\" - Migraine Aura Foundation \\"Migraine, Epilepsy, and Migralepsy: Myths and Realities\\" - UC Davis Department of Neurology However, not every migraine may be accompanied by a seizure and sometimes the seizures happen without any migraine involvement. Due to this, finding the origin of migralepsy is difficult and enveloped somewhere in the overlap between both conditions. Some patients have shown that their relatives suffered from migraines as well and even some from migralepsy, forming the possibility that migralepsy is genetic in origin and forms only rarely as both, generally resulting in only one condition or the other.\\"Epilepsy Migraine - More than just a headache\\" - .docstoc Diagnosis Because epileptic seizures may occur with a side effect that resembles migraine aura, it is complicated to diagnose whether a patient is having a normal epileptic episode or if it is a true migraine that is then being followed by a seizure, which would be a true sign of migralepsy. Many neurological symptoms can only be expressed by the patient, who can confuse different feelings, especially when the symptoms of a migraine are extremely similar to that of a seizure. Thus, many physicians are reluctant to consider migralepsy to be a true condition, considering its rarity, and those that do believe in it are prone to over-diagnose it, leading to more problems in terms of finding the truth of the condition. \\"Migralepsy\\" and the Significance of Differentiating Occipital Seizures from Migraine - InterScience However, it has been found that EEG scans have been able to differentiate between migraine auras and auras related to epilepsy. It has generally been seen that EEG scans are not as helpful in determining facets of migraines as they are with epilepsy. Though they are able to work in determining the starting and ending points of migraines and the overlap of epileptic episodes during or after them, even if the scans are still lacking in considerable necessary data and confusing results. EEG scans have been able to observe seizures that occur in between the aura and headache phase of migraines and such occurrences have been termed intercalated seizures.\\"The EEG: Differential diagnosis of migraine and epilepsy\\" - Epilepsy.com Treatment Since migralepsy is, for all intents and purposes, a combination of migraines and epilepsy, the medication for the conditions supplied individually can be combined jointly in order to lessen the effects of both. It is also helpful that many antiepileptic drugs also work as antimigraines, lessening the number of medications that must be taken. Thus, while neither can be cured, they can be treated so that they occur less frequently and allow a patient to live a relatively normal life.

These elections took place in the Palazzo delle Canoniche adjoining the Perugia Cathedral. The Cathedral contained the tombs of Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216), Pope Urban IV (1261‚Äì1264), and Pope Martin IV (1281‚Äì1285).

During du Puy's tenure as papal governor during the War of the Eight Saints he pillaged the Duomo construction site for materials for his private fortress.Heywood, 1910, pp. 254-255.

File:IX.Bonifac.jpgPope Boniface IX (1389-1404) lived in Perugia from September 1392 until July 1393 Background Pope Zacharias convinced Lombard King Ratchis to abandon his siege of the city in 749. The city was also included in the \\"Donation of Pepin\\", and thus added to the Papal States. History as a papal residence=Innocent III Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216) was in Perugia in September 1198 to consecrate S. Lorenzo; by October, he had left for Todi.Heywood, 1910, p. 65. Innocent III died in Perugia in 1216, where the cardinals gathered to elect Honorius III. Gregory IX According to Heywood, :\\"During their relentless persecution of the second Frederick, the popes, and especially Gregory IX, were often resident in Perugia. There they were able to mature their ambitious schemes in safety; while the city that sheltered and protected them reaped a rich reward for its loyalty in praise and privileges. Thither, in June, 1228, came Gregory, driven from Rome by a Ghibelline revolt; and thence he directed the invasion of the Kingdom of Naples. He was still in Perugia when, in May, 1229, Frederick landed at Brindisi, and, unfurling the Banner of the Cross against the Banner of the Keys, repelled and defeated the conquering armies of the Church. Only in February, 1230, did the pope return to Rome, and, in 1234, he was again in Perugia, where he remained until December, 1236.\\"Heywood, 1910, pp. 69-70. According to Heywood, Perugia \\"virtually assumed the position of Papal Vicar in Umbria.\\"Heywood, 1910, p. 70. The two apparently had a falling out by the time of Martin IV, who excommunicated the entire city of Perugia for disobeying his order not to exact vengeance upon the Bishopric of Foligno, and he and his cardinals were burned in effigy in Perugia.Heywood, 1910, p. 74. Innocent IV After the death of Frederick II, Pope Innocent IV (1243‚Äì1254) returned to Italy and reached Perugia in November 1251.Heywood, 1910, p. 75. He did not resume his journey towards Rome until 1253, when he was summoned by Senator Brancaleone. According to Heywood, :\\"During his residence in Perugia, he did all in his power to prove his gratitude for her unwavering loyalty, and, in a Privilege of the 3rd of October, 1252, which was addressed to the Bishop of the city and which is still preserved among the municipal archives, he recalls the exceeding great affliction and labor which she had endured 'pro fidei puritate atque devotionis sinceritate servanda erga Romanam Ecclesiam matrem suam.' Moreover, during those prosperous years, Perugia reasserted her authority over many towns which through fear of the Emperor she had permitted to throw off their allegiance.\\"Heywood, 1910, pp. 75-76. Urban IV Pope Urban IV (1261‚Äì1264) lived in Perugia in 1264, while fleeing with his Curia from Pietro Di Vico, who was planning to ambush him in Orvieto.Heywood, 1910, p. 77. Urban Iv remained in Perugia until his death. Benedict XI Pope Benedict XI (1303‚Äì1304) took refuge in Perugia upon his election where he died in July 1304, triggering an eleven-month election in the \\"Palazzo del Papa.\\"Heywood, 1910, p. 101. Pope Clement V (1305‚Äì1314) was elected, who moved the papacy to Avignon, causing the Avignon Papacy. Boniface IX Pope Boniface IX (1389‚Äì1404) lived in Perugia from September 1392 until 1393 during the Western Schism.Creighton, 1882, A history of the papacy during the period of the reformation, Volume 1, p. 121-22. His legate, Pileo, the archbishop of Ravenna, had been guarding the citadel and the city in his absence. While in the city, Boniface IX recalled the Guelphic exiles and achieved a military victory against Giovanni Sciarra da Vico. One of these exiles was murdered in the streets in July 1393 and Pandolfo de' Baglioni, a noble, interfered with the Podesta's ability to hand down a sentence; in retaliation, an angry mob killed Pandolfo and much of his family. As the city erupted in violence, the pope and his aides fled to Assisi. Papal Palace A portion of the Canonica (rectory), which had previously been \\"invaded\\" by the civic magistrates, was occupied by the popes, and later became known as the Palazzo del Papa; it was later used as the residence of the papal governor (Palazzo del Governatore).Heywood, 1910, p. 353. The Canonica was connected to the Bishop's Palace by massive arches which now comprise the Via delle Volte. The Great Hall was capable of seating 600 persons. The palace, then the residence of the papal governor, burned to the ground in 1534.Heywood, 1910, p. 350. Pope Pius IV (1559-1565) granted the site and the remains to Cardinal Fulvio della Corgna. The Piazza della Paglia was renamed Piazza del Papa in 1816, when a statute of Pope Julius III (1550‚Äì1555) was moved there.Heywood, 1910, p. 265. Later papal relations In 1375, Perugia was one of the first cities to join Florence in rebellion against Gregory XI in the War of the Eight Saints. Pope Boniface IX (1389‚Äì1404) reclaimed the city in 1403. In 1416, Pope Martin V (1417‚Äì1431) recognized Braccio da Montone as lord of Perugia. Pope Julius II (1503‚Äì1513) conquered Gian Paolo Baglione in the city in 1506, and Pope Leo X (1513‚Äì1521) ordered him decapitated in 1520. Thereafter, Perugia was again an immediate dependency of the Holy See. The city rebelled against Pope Paul III's (1534‚Äì1549) salt tax in 1540. Pierluigi Farnese suppressed the rebellion for Paul III, who built a fortress in the city. Pope Julius III (1550‚Äì1555) restored many of the cities privileges thereafter. When the Perugians rebelled again in 1848 they demolished Paul III's tower. Pontifical troops retook the city again in 1859. Pope Leo XIII (1878‚Äì1903), a former bishop of Perugia, made the see an archdiocese upon his election. NotesReferences *William Heywood. 1910. A History of Perugia.

James Whitelaw BA, MRIA (1749 ‚Äì 4 February 1813) was an Irish historian, writer, statistician, Anglican priest and philanthropist. Life He was born in County Leitrim and educated at Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Scholar in 1769, and graduated in 1771 with a BA. He was ordained in the Church of Ireland and became rector of St. James and then St. Catherine's in Thomas St. in Dublin. He carried out a great deal of work on behalf of the poor, including establishing the Erasmus Smith Free School on the Coombe and other institutions. In 1798 he carried out a census of the city of Dublin (a difficult undertaking at the time on account of the 1798 Rising). Epidemic diseases were then frequent in Dublin, but, undeterred by the fear of infection, he personally inspected nearly every house in the city and questioned nearly every inhabitant. Hitherto the extent of the population had been only vaguely conjectured - he counted a total population of 182,370. He published the results of his investigations in 1805 in his Essay on the Population of Dublin in 1798. The many detailed statistics which he accumulated were stored in the city archives in Dublin Castle, which were among those destroyed in the Four Courts during the Irish Civil War in 1922. In 1805 he was made one of the members of the commission to inquire into the conduct of the paving board of Dublin. He formed the Meath Charitable Loan in 1808.

The history of the Willard Branch was tied with the history of the asylum at Willard.  Asylum history = State Agricultural College of Ovid  The State Agricultural College of Ovid opened its doors in 1860 on the site of a former farm. The college building was located at the top of the hill east of Willard Landing on Seneca Lake. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 the entire student body enlisted and in 1862 the college closed leaving New York State holding a $40,000 mortgage. When the Civil War ended in 1865 Ezra Cornell attempted to obtain the site but was unsuccessful.  Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane  Later in 1865 the New York legislature enacted a bill co-sponsored by Dr. Sylvester D. Willard, who had recently died of typhus, authorizing the construction of a mental hospital at Willard. This was in response to a petition of Dorothea Dix concerning the deplorable conditions of the mentally ill in the county poor houses in 1843. By 1869 the construction of the initial phase of the Main Building was complete and the first patients admitted. The population grew very quickly;in 1870 several wings were added to the main building. At the same time the former agricultural college building was refurbished, named Branch and used to house women patients. Detached building number 1 \\"Maples\\" was constructed in 1872. By 1873 the population was 530 patients. Three more buildings were added by 1877 when Willard, at 475 acres (1500 patients) was the largest asylum in the United States. Produce from the farm and goods manufactured in the various shops allowed the asylum to be, for the most part, self-sufficient. One need was coal for heating during the cold winters. The hospital used 4000 tons of coal a year. Coal was brought down the Chemung Canal to Watkins Glen and then sent by lake steamer to Willard Landing. The coal would then be hauled to the various buildings. Moving coal from the lake landing to the various buildings proved to be difficult. The state was petitioned in 1877 for funds to construct a railroad to service the asylum.  Railroad construction = Asylum Railroad  In 1877 the state approved the construction of a narrow gauge (3 ft) railroad. Construction was performed by the patients of the asylum and by the end of the year a line two and one eighth miles was in place running from the landing at the lake to Branch at the top of the hill. There were side tracks to the main building and detached buildings number 1 and 3. A (0-6-0T) steam engine was ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works.(Baldwin construction number 4217 class 6-14-d saddletank engine, with 33inch drivers, 10√ó16 inch cylinders, 450 gallon tank) Rolling stock consisted of 1 passenger car, 6 freight and coal cars, 2 swill cars and 1 lumber car. There were a few four wheel dump cars. Two of the buildings (detached buildings 2 and 4) had been built on the south side of the Simpson creek ravine, opposite the other buildings. For two years the asylum petitioned the state for funds to build an embankment across the ravine. Finally in 1881 the asylum built the embankment on their own with patient labor. The embarrassed state approved funds for the rail and ties to reach these two buildings.  Hayts Corners, Ovid & Willard Railroad  A new problem arose. The Chemung Canal had been constructed with 53 wooden locks saving a lot of money in construction costs but they proved to be a maintenance nightmare. The canal was never profitable and with the arrival of the railroads the asylum worried about the future reliability of lake shipments of coal and salt. The asylum petitioned the state and the Hatys Corners, Ovid & Willard Railroad was chartered on 15 September 1882George W. Jones President succeeded following his death in 1886 by J. B. Thomas to make a connection between the asylum railroad and the Geneva, Ithaca and Sayre Railroad (owned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LV) since 1876) at Hayts Corners. The line was to be dual gauge. Grading had actually started in August 1882 and was completed before winter. The incomplete line was leased to the Geneva, Ithaca & Sayre Railroad (GI&S;) on 27 December 1882. Work resumed in the spring; the GI&S; supplied the ties, rail and ballast and work was essentially completed by April. A controversy arose over the charge per mile for passengers that was resolved by law on 11 May 1883. The line opened for business three days later.  Operations = Asylum Railroad  Each day a train would leave the engine facility at the lake landing and begin to climb the hill. The train would stop at each building along the way. A light blue laundry car would drop off clean laundry and pick up dirty laundry. A red store car was equipped with a desk and pigeon holes for each building. Requests for supplies would be submitted in the morning. A full four wheel garbage dump car would be picked up at each building. When the train reached the Branch at the top of the hill it would back down to the \\"piggery\\" and leave the garbage cars. In the afternoon the train would leave a clean empty garbage car and the supplies requested in the morning. Coal was delivered as needed.  Hayts Corners, Ovid & Willard Railroad  Passenger = When operations started the line ran three passenger trains each way. Two buses (horse drawn) met the train at the Ovid Station. Bus fare was 10 cents and train fare was 15 cents (from Ovid?). By June 1, 1884 there were five trains in each direction. In 1899 a new passenger station was constructed along main street in Willard.Originally the station was called asylum and the station on the main line was called Willard. In 1900 the LV changed the name of the name of the Willard station to Gilbert, in honor of Captain Morris Gilbert, stewart of the Willard Asylum since 1873. The asylum station was renamed Willard. = Freight = The line saw a brisk freight business. In November 1883 the Ovid Independent reported that 268 freight cars passed over the line that month. In 1884 the iron rail was replaced with 40 lb steel rail. The line remained dual gauge for a few years. In the report of the GI&S; for 1885 had no mention of any narrow gauge track. A photo of the Branch while under reconstruction in 1886 shows dual gauge track. The GI&S; had steep grades in and out of Ithaca impeding freight operations. The LV decided to construct a freight line that bypassed Ithaca running down the east side of Seneca Lake. The line was complete by 1892. It passed just east of the Branch in a long rock cut. A station was built just south of Simpson Creek and a spur was laid from the station to connect with the asylum line by the bakery. Most freight bound for Willard used this new connection.  Willard  In 1883 the state allocated funds for the construction of a coal dock next to the freight depot by the Branch. The line within the asylum was reconfigured and converted to standard gauge about the same time as the construction of the Seneca Lake bypass. A new 0-4-0T was ordered from Baldwin.Baldwin construction number 13494 with 14x24\\" cylinders and 44\\" drivers. Named Willard and numbered 2 painted olive green and aluminum and had kerosene lamps at either end Five switches, 19,980 feet of steel rail and 2,000 white oak ties were used.  Ovid  Kinne Brothers constructed a lumber yard, coal trestles and a grain elevator at the Ovid Station. Standard Oil had storage tanks at the depot.Ovid Gazette 7 June 1898 For a number of years a fruit evaporator produced dried fruit for shipment.Ovid Gazette 17 May 1940 Boyce Moters in Ovid received shipments of autos and tractors from the depot.Ovid Gazette 9 June 1921 Residence moving in and out of Ovid took advantage and shipped their households by rail. The traveling circus and yearly Redpath Co.'s Chautauque came and went by rail.  Abandonment  The arrival of the Seneca Lake bypass eliminated most of the freight traffic between Ovid and Willard. Passenger traffic fell off as more people bought automobiles. In 1935 the Willard State Hospital decided to convert to central steam heat for all the buildings. When the system was in place the Asylum railroad was removed. Only a spur from the main line to the bakery and the steam plant remained. That same year passenger service ended between Willard and Ovid. The tracks were soon removed. In 1937 passenger service ended between Ovid and Hayts Corners. The line to Ovid saw occasional freight service to the coal trestle and Seneca Lumber at Ovid. Finally in 1959 the tracks between Ovid and Hayts Corners were removed.Ovid Gazette 19 November 1959 noted that the RR crossing sign on Rt 96 was still in place but the tracks were gone.

He studied economics at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, and graduated in 1976. In 1974, Ak√ßam was arrested for participating in student protests against the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In 1975 he was arrested for distributing leaflets and placing posters around the city. (Ak√ßam notes that \\"one had to obtain permission from what is now called the Security General Directorate's Special Inspection Branch Directorate for the Associations, and that even with a special permit in hand, one could be arbitrarily arrested and apprehended at police headquarters for 3-5 days.\\") On March 9, 1976, soon after graduating from university, while a graduate student at the same department, he was arrested for his involvement in producing a student journal that focused on the treatment of Kurds in Turkey. Devrimci Gen√ßlik (Revolutionary Youth) was the journal of a radical leftist organization, Devrimci Yol (\\"Revolutionary Path\\"). Ak√ßam explained that he accepted the editorship position, aged 22, as none of his peers would, knowing that it could land him in jail. His fears materialized when he received a nine-year sentence in early 1977, which resulted in Amnesty International naming him as a prisoner of conscience. He served for a year before escaping from Ankara Central Prison on March 12, 1977, using the leg of an iron stove to dig a hole. He received political asylum from West Germany in 1978, where he obtained citizenship and resided until obtaining his doctorate degree in 1995. In August 1988, Ak√ßam began work as a research scientist at the Hamburg Institute for Social Research.Taner Ak√ßam, Dr. phil., Hamburg Institute for Social Research He received his PhD from Leibniz University Hannover with a dissertation titled, Turkish Nationalism and the Armenian Genocide: On the Background of the Military Tribunals in Istanbul between 1919 and 1922.

In 1997, a Dutch documentary titled \\"Een Muur van Stilte\\" (A Wall of Silence), written and directed by Doroth√©e Forma of the Humanist Broadcasting Foundation (), was made about their academic relationship. Ak√ßam was Visiting Associate Professor of History at the University of Minnesota, United States before joining Clark University's Strassler Family Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies. After the assassination of Hrant Dink in 2007, Ak√ßam attended Dink's funeral in Istanbul. According to the Intelligence Report, the journal of the Southern Poverty Law Center, > Dink's friend and ideological ally Taner Ak√ßam, a distinguished Turkish > historian and sociologist on the faculty of the University of Minnesota's > Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, attended Dink's funeral in > Turkey, despite the considerable risk to his own life.

The book is a definitive history based in large part on > official documents from Turkish government archives. In 2008, when Ak√ßam's appointment as the chairman of Armenian genocide studies at Clark University was questioned by local Turks as biased, Deborah Dwork, director of the Strassler Family Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark, said that \\"ethnic or religious identity is not crucial to any appointment,\\" and that \\"they hire the best scholars in the pool\\". On 29 January 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Ak√ßam the medal for courage for \\"denouncing denial\\" of the Armenian Genocide.  Legal disputes  In January 2007, the Turkish government officially launched an investigation against Ak√ßam regarding an October 6, 2006, newspaper column in the Turkish- Armenian journal Agos. (Hrant Dink, 301, and a criminal complaint) In it Ak√ßam criticized the prosecution of Agos managing editor Hrant Dink for using the term \\"genocide\\", regarding the Armenian Genocide. The use of the term was construed by the prosecutor's office as the criminal offense of \\"insulting Turkishness\\" under Article 301 of Turkey's penal code. Highlighting the term \\"genocide\\", Ak√ßam declared himself an accessory to the charges against Hrant Dink, and urged readers to join in Dink's support. Later in January 2007 an Istanbul court decided not to pursue the charges against Ak√ßam. Ak√ßam faced harassment after discovering the identity of the creator of the Web site Tall Armenian Tale, which had called Ak√ßam a \\"turncoat\\" and posted his personal information. Fearing reprisals after the assassination of Hrant Dink, Ak√ßam entreated the Coordination Council of Armenian Organisations in France and president Sarkozy to pressure Ankara to protect him. On February 16, 2007 Ak√ßam was detained in Canada at the airport in Montreal for nearly four hours after arriving on a flight from the United States. He was due to give a lecture at the invitation of the McGill University Faculty of Law and Concordia University. In explaining his detention, Taner Ak√ßam says that Canadian authorities referred to an inaccurate version of his biography on Wikipedia from around December 24, 2006, which called him a terrorist. On February 18, 2007 he was also detained at the US border and has been so far unable to find out the reason for his being detained there. While on a lecture tour in 2007 he faced further harassment by persons turning up and disrupting his speaking engagements.

The author describes society and problems in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the early 1960s, in a \\"quest for personal integrity within a flawed system\\". The book won the Heinrich Mann Prize, and has been translated into many languages.  History  Wolf wrote the work in the early 1960s, with the novel beginning as a story about romance and the characters' experiences in a socialist work \\"brigade\\". From there it develops into a more complex plot prompted by political events. It was published in 1963 by Mitteldeutscher Verlag in Halle, became a bestseller in the GDR and was also widely distributed and discussed in the West. The title became a metaphor for the divided Germany. The novel was awarded the Heinrich Mann Prize. In 1987, Suhrkamp Verlag published it in its BasisBibliothek (Basic Library), with historic background and commentary. The book's title was first translated into English as Divided Heaven, and in 2013 (50 years after the first publication) interpreted by Luise von Flotow as They Divided the Sky.  Plot  The main characters are Rita Seidel, age 19, and Manfred Herrfurth, a chemist ten years older, who meet at a dance event in a village and become a couple, although they are different. Rita comes from a rural background and is emotional, while Manfred is a rational city-dweller. The action begins in East Germany in June 1961, shortly before the Berlin Wall is built. They live together with Manfred's parents in Halle, where he works and she studies to be a teacher, which includes training in a socialist work \\"brigade\\" at the company Waggonbau Ammendorf, building rail wagons. Manfred, who grew up in a difficult family, becomes disillusioned about the future in the GDR, after one of his engineering designs is refused by economics officials. He moves to West Germany via East Berlin. Rita visits him there and tries to persuade him to return, but without success. Shortly after her return, the Wall is built. Rita tries to take her life. She wakes up from unconsciousness in hospital and tells the story from that perspective.  Style  Wolf begins the novel like a love story, but soon introduces the divided Germany as a reason for tension. She describes the western lifestyle as commercial and materialistic, while she idealises the eastern society as harder, rigid, moral-oriented and demanding faith. Some elements of Rita's biography are similar to the author's, such as growing up without a father and work in the specific brigade. She describes negative aspects of life in the east with factual precision and was criticised for it. Her tenor was described as an \\"introspective, autobiographical voice\\", her trademark in a \\"quest for personal integrity within a flawed system\\".  Legacy  The novel was filmed as Der geteilte Himmel in 1964. A stage version premiered in Dresden in 2013.

He was a hairdresser and tobacconist for two decades before entering the auctioneering business. He was elected Mayor of Christchurch in 1885 unopposed, and was re-elected a year later in the most keenly contested mayoral election thus far, narrowly beating Charles Louisson. He retired after his second term as mayor. In 1887 he contested a for and the for , but came second on both occasions. After his mayoralty, he lived mostly a private life and was known as an avid gardener. Early life Ayers was born in Gloucester, England, in 1836. He married Isabella Eliza Ayers (n√©e Williams) in Newington, Surrey in 1859. She was a daughter of F. F. Williams of London. They came to Canterbury on the Gananoque, which arrived in Lyttelton on 9 May 1860. Upon his arrival, he built a house at 290 Riverlaw Terrace in Opawa (these days a suburb of Christchurch). The building is these days registered with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as Category II, with registration number 3730. Professional life Ayers, Beauchamp & Co auction building in Cashel Street For his first 20 years in Christchurch, Ayers was a hairdresser and tobacconist. In 1880, he changed profession and became an auctioneer. His firm, Ayers, Beauchamp & Company, was based at 190 Cashel Street (just east of Manchester Street) and auctioned land, livestock, fruit and general goods. Political career Ayers was elected as a councillor at Christchurch City Council in 1878, 1879 and 1882. Ayers and James Gapes contested the Christchurch mayoral election on 24 November 1880, which was won by Gapes. Charles Hulbert and Ayers were nominated for the mayoralty in Christchurch November 1883, and since both were well-known personalities, the election campaign period was interesting and lively. Hulbert won the election, which was held on 28 November, and received 671 votes to 496, a majority of 175 votes. On 17 November 1885, Ayers was elected unopposed as Mayor of Christchurch. He was installed by the outgoing mayor, Charles Hulbert, at a meeting on 16 December 1885. Even before his installation, he had attended civic duties as mayor-elect together with the mayor, for example the opening of a band rotunda in Latimer Square, the start of the construction of the Corporation Line (tramway) and the opening of the Armagh Street Bridge into Hagley Park. One of his first tasks as mayor was the unveiling of the Moorhouse Statue (commemorating William Sefton Moorhouse) in the Botanic Gardens. Ayers stood for the mayoralty again in 1886. He was challenged by Charles Louisson, who had been a councillor since 1881. Louisson stood for the mayoralty after a public request made by the other eleven councillors (including Samuel Manning, Samuel Paull Andrews, William Prudhoe and Charles Gray), nine ex mayors (John Ollivier, Henry Sawtell, Fred Hobbs, Henry Thomson, William Wilson, Charles Hulbert, James Gapes, John Anderson and George Ruddenklau) and 13 ex councillors (including Daniel Reese). It was the most keenly contested mayoral election thus far, and Louisson was narrowly beaten by Ayers, with 636 to 631 votes. Ayers retired at the end of his mayoralty a year later, and Louisson decided to stand again and was elected unopposed. Hence, Ayers had been mayor for two terms. Linwood Cemetery The death on 17 December 1886 of John Coster, who represented the electorate in Parliament, caused an . There were several people interested in standing in the electorate, but with Frederic Jones and Ayers, who had just been elected as Mayor of Christchurch, considered as the only contenders as having a chance of success, most other candidates withdrew from the contest. On nomination day on 2 February 1887, Jones and Ayers were nominated. A third person, James Arthur Williams, nominated himself, but could not find anybody to second this motion. Thus, the by-election was a two-person contest. On election day, 8 February 1887, the majority opinion was that Ayers would win. There was great interest in the election, as evidenced by the high turnout. Jones had a considerable majority over Ayers, with 527 and 336 votes, respectively. The 191 votes majority was mirrored by Jones having won all four polling stations. Westby Perceval, Ayers, Henry Thomson and Eden George contested the Christchurch South electorate in the . Perceval won the election and Ayers came a distant second. Private life and death After his mayoralty, Ayers lived a mostly private life. He did, however, become a borough councillor in Linwood. He was known as an avid gardener and had a great love for flowers, and generally had a flower in his button hole. After suffering from failing health for some time, Ayers died on 16 September 1900 at his home in River Road in Avonside. He was buried at Linwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and eight of their children. His wife died on 9 September 1927 and was buried with her husband.

Born in London, and relocated to Australia as a teenager, he worked in farming and on the gold fields. He moved to Christchurch to join his brother Alfred (b. 1832) in business, which they conducted in transport, as merchants and farmers in various places in the South Island. Back in Christchurch, they were joined by their brother Cecil (b. 1837) and bought a brewery, which under their stewardship became very successful. With financial security behind him, Louisson first became a councillor for Christchurch City Council for six years (1881‚Äì1887) before being elected Mayor of Christchurch (1887‚Äì1889 and 1897‚Äì1899). In all of his two elections as councillor, and four elections as mayor, he was returned unopposed. Subsequently, to his retirement from the mayoralty, he was appointed to the Legislative Council (1900‚Äì1924). He held other public offices, for example as Freemason and as a trustee of a benevolent trust. For the last 18 years of his life, he was the president of the NZ Metropolitan Trotting Club (NZMTC) in Christchurch. He helped secure the site of the Addington Raceway and was responsible for greatly extending the area. Early life Charles Louisson was the son of George Melville Louisson, a London umbrella maker originally from Portsmouth. He was born in 1840 in London and educated at Gravesend. At age 14, he arrived in Melbourne and had experience of station life in the country such as stock-riding and horse-breaking. He subsequently went gold mining at Ballarat and other places. He arrived in Canterbury in 1865 to join his brother Alfred, and they had a business for the short time to carry goods over the Port Hills (this was just prior to the opening of the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel). The brothers moved to Hokitika, where they worked as general merchants. Charles Louisson was associated with the Volunteers, as sergeant major of the Westland Light Horse. Louisson then moved to Marlborough for sheep farming, but the business was not lucrative. The brothers then moved to Southbridge and had a small farm there. Life in Christchurch Bottling Store, Crown Brewery Alfred and Charles Louisson returned to Christchurch in 1871 and they were joined by their brother Cecil. In 1871 or 1876(sources differ), the brothers first purchased a majority shareholding in the Crown Brewery Company and eventually obtained the remaining shares, with Alfred being the most shrewd business person of the trio. The site, on the corner of Antigua and St Asaph Streets in the Christchurch Central City, is still a brewery these days (the Canterbury Brewery), but has been closed since the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and will be demolished. Louisson and his brother also owned a drapery and outfitting business, with branches in towns throughout New Zealand. With Alexander Fergusson of the National Bank, he was a co-trustee of the Marks Benevolent Fund (these days called the Hyman Marks Trust), which supplied the main portion of the cost incurred in the erection of the Marks Ward at the Christchurch Hospital, amounting to ¬£10,000. The foundation stone for the ward was laid by Fergusson and Louisson on 10 September 1896. The Marks Ward is today known as wards six and seven at Christchurch Hospital. As a Freemason, Louisson held office for many years as District Grand Master for Canterbury under the Scottish Constitution. Louisson was the first president of the Christchurch Beautifying Association. He held leading positions in the Jewish congregation in Christchurch, e.g. treasurer. On 3 July 1878 Louisson married Hannah Harris, the second daughter of Maurice Harris JP of Christchurch, at Beth El Synagogue. Louisson had known Maurice Harris for many years, as Harris also held leading positions at the synagogue, e.g. president of the Jewish congregation. They had two sons (Maurice George, born 26 May 1879; Cecil, born 3 June 1880) and two daughters (one of them born on 1 December 1881). The Louissons lived at 214 Gloucester Street for some years, and had at another time a house in Colombo Street designed by Joseph Maddison, one of Christchurch's leading architects. Political career Charles Louisson caricature, 1899 Louisson entered into local politics as a member of the Christchurch City Council (CCC), in which he served for six years, and was mayor from 1887 to 1889, and again from 1897 to 1899. He first stood as a councillor for CCC in 1881 in the South-west Ward. The other candidate, James Tait, formally withdrew from the election on 5 September, and Louisson was thus declared elected unopposed. Back then, each ward was represented by three councillors, and one of the councillors retired per year. Louisson was thus due to retire in 1884. On 4 September of that year, Louisson was the only candidate nominated in the South-west Ward, and he was thus declared elected. He retired at the end of the term in September 1887 and did not stand for re- election. He first stood for the mayoralty in 1886, after a public request made by the other eleven councillors (including Samuel Manning, Samuel Paull Andrews, William Prudhoe and Charles Gray), nine ex mayors (John Ollivier, Henry Sawtell, Fred Hobbs, Henry Thomson, William Wilson, Charles Hulbert, James Gapes, John Anderson and George Ruddenklau) and 13 ex councillors (including Daniel Reese). It was the most keenly contested mayoral election thus far, and Louisson was narrowly beaten by the incumbent, Aaron Ayers, with 636 to 631 votes. Ayers retired at the end of his second term of mayoralty a year later, and Louisson decided to stand again. Eden George, who had just contested the Christchurch South electorate in the September 1887 general election (coming fourth against Westby Perceval) was requested by 227 ratepayers to contest the mayoralty. He declined by basically stating that Louisson was the stronger candidate. On election day (21 November 1887), Louisson was the only candidate and he was thus declared mayor elect. Louisson took the mayoral chair on 21 December 1887. At the end of the term, Louisson planned to retire, as he believed that the mayoralty should change every year. He was, however, prepared to make himself available if no other suitable person would contest the mayoralty. In the end, nobody else came forward and on 21 November 1888, Louisson was declared re-elected as the only contender. Louisson retired at the end of his second year, and Samuel Manning, as the only contender, was declared mayor elect on 21 November 1889 and installed in December 1889. Louisson was again asked to stand for mayor in September 1897. He was elected unopposed on 16 November and installed on 15 December. Louisson was again approached by a delegation towards the end of his third term as mayor, urging him to stand again. Whilst he had wanted some other leading citizen to take on the role as mayor, he acceded to the request and his name was put forward. For a fourth time, Louisson was elected unopposed on 21 November 1898. Louisson was succeeded by William Reece, who was elected unopposed on 20 November 1899 and installed as mayor on 20 December 1899. During his first mayoralty, Louisson acted as one of the Commissioners for New Zealand at the Melbourne International Exhibition. He was afterwards a member of the Charitable Aid Board and the North Canterbury Hospital Board, and official visitor of the Deaf and Dumb Institution at Sumner, and deputy inspector of the Sunnyside Lunatic Asylum. Louisson's services as mayor were recognised on two occasions by the citizens of Christchurch, who presented him in 1889 with a fine silver epergne, and again in 1899, on his retirement from the mayoralty, with an address and a silver tea service, and on each occasion the mayoress was presented with a diamond bracelet and star. He was called to the Legislative Council on 22 December 1900. Since the Legislative Council Act 1891 had been in force, appointments were for seven-year terms. His first term ended on 21 December 1907, and he was reappointed on 14 January 1908. His second term ended on 13 January 1915, and he was reappointed over three years later on 7 May 1918. He served his third term until his death. Horse racing Addington grand stand in November 1903 He was a member of the Canterbury Jockey Club and a steward of the NZ Metropolitan Trotting Club (NZMTC) in Christchurch. From 1906 until his death in 1924, he was the president of the NZMTC. The trotting club used to be based at Lancaster Park in Waltham, and Louisson helped to obtain land in Addington, where Addington Raceway has been since 1899. The grounds were enlarged during his presidency. The Louisson Handicap was an annual race that was held for many years. Louisson donated the trophy for the New Zealand Trotting Cup, which he had manufactured in England.

It began in 1704 as a missionary parish of the Church of England. The church is located in Malvern and near Phoenixville, East Whiteland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. A more detailed history of the church is on their website. The parish is part of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The current stone church building was constructed sporadically between 1728-1744 to replace an earlier wooden building built by 1710. The 1744 building was a stone structure with a medium pitched gable roof measuring 47 feet by 28 feet. A two-story addition was built in 1856, and the 1 1/2-story Parish House added in 1901. During the American Revolution, the church was used as a hospital by both British and American forces. Note: This includes By local tradition, after the nearby Battle of Paoli in 1777 the British Army, recognizing St. Peter's as part of the Church of England, oversaw the burial of a British officer (believed to be Captain William Wolfe, commander of the Light Company of the British 40th Regiment of Foot), at least two other unidentified British soldiers, and at least five unidentified American soldiers killed in the battle. The British and American men are buried side by side along the old west wall of the churchyard. Several small American and British flags are traditionally kept at the graves out of respect for the soldiers from both armies (see illustration, below). Over its 300+ year history, St. Peter‚Äôs has been led by more than three dozen missionaries and priests. After a series of architectural modernizations (many later referred to as vandalisms) in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the church was carefully restored in 1944 to somewhat approximate the simplicity of the original 1744 building. Early in the 21st century the growing congregation built a timber-framed parish center and modern worship space designed in a style reminiscent of the original Welsh barns in the area. The original church building, and the adjacent burial ground, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. File:Sheep at St Peters.JPGSheep trim the grass in the graveyard.

His father James Gapes was twice mayor in the 1870s/80s. The family was of humble origin, had come out to New Zealand from London as assisted immigrants and were running a painting and paper-hanging business, but had come to status in their new country. Early life Gapes was born in London in 1848, to James Gapes and his wife Jane (n√©e Le Lean). His father had moved there from Saffron Walden in Essex. The Gapes family emigrated to New Zealand in 1859 when Thomas was eleven years old. The parents came out with their children and other relatives ‚Äì Hannah (21 years), Charlotte (16 years), Mary (7 years), Angelina (5 years) and Emily (8 months), plus his father's cousin Lizzie Westwood (b. 1826 in Hertfordshire). They left Gravesend on 29 August 1859 and arrived in Lyttelton on 4 December 1859 on board the Regina. Gapes received part of his education in London, and part of it in Christchurch. Professional life Gapes worked in his father's painting and paper-hanging business in 71 Victoria Street, Christchurch. He took over the business in 1889 when his father retired. Political career Before 1916, elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. Gapes became a Member of the City Council in 1890 for the North-East Ward, was re-elected 1893, 1894 and was then represented from 1905 to 1913. On 29 November 1893, Gapes contested the mayoral election against the incumbent, Eden George. George had been the youngest mayor so far (at the 1893 election, he was 30 years of age) and was the only mayor thus far who had not previously served as a councillor, that is he had not had any political experience. George had been ineffective as a mayor, and had been in conflict with the councillors. Gapes and George received 820 and 365 votes, respectively, which represented the largest majority in a Christchurch mayoral election at that time. Gapes was installed as the new mayor at a council meeting on 20 December and was mayor during 1894. During his mayoralty, he was involved with several relief and charitable funds, including for the sinking on 29 October 1894 of the SS Wairarapa, which was one of New Zealand's deadliest disasters. The next mayoral election was held on 28 November 1894. Gapes stood again, and was challenged by two sitting councillors, Walter Cooper and Edward Smith. Cooper, Gapes, and Smith received 587, 364, and 246 votes, respectively. Cooper was thus declared elected, and was installed as mayor on 19 December 1894. Family and death On 23 February 1876, he married Marion (or Marianne) Elizabeth Prebble (24 September 1852 ‚Äì 17 March 1919) at St Luke's Church in Christchurch. They had one daughter, Bertha Marion (29 January 1877 ‚Äì 4 August 1954). Gapes had come from a working-class background, but the family gained a high status in Christchurch. When the Canterbury edition of The Cyclopedia of New Zealand was produced, it was him who wrote the various entries for the Gapes family. As the Cyclopedia was vanity press, it gave Gapes the chance to downplay the family's humble background, and he focussed on their important associations in Christchurch. Gapes died at his Christchurch residence on 16 April 1913, aged 65, and was buried at Linwood Cemetery. His wife, Marion Elizabeth Gapes, died on 17 March 1919, aged 65.

Life He was born in Dublin, son of James and Mary Williams, who came from Westmeath. He grew up in Grenanstown, a townland near the Devil's Bit in County Tipperary, where his father farmed for Count Dalton. He was educated at Tullabeg Jesuit College and St. Patrick's College, Carlow. He started contributing verses to the Nation in 1843. He was immediately successful; in the edition of 21 January 1843 there appeared: \\"Shamrock is a jewel. He cannot write too often. His verses are full of vigour, and as natural as the harp of Tara\\". Later in 1843 he came to Dublin to study medicine. In 1848, with Thomas Antisell and Kevin O'Doherty, he brought out a newspaper, The Irish Tribune, to take the place of the suppressed United Irishman, founded by John Mitchel. Before the sixth weekly publication, it was seized by the Government, and proceedings were instituted against the editors. On 30 October 1848, at a third trial, O'Doherty was convicted and transported to Australia; Antisell fled to the U.S.A., arriving in November. Williams, tried two days after O'Doherty, was acquitted. He resumed his medical studies, took out his degree at Edinburgh in 1849 and emigrated to America in 1851. In the USA he practised medicine until he became ill and died of tuberculosis in Thibodaux, Louisiana in 1862. He is buried there in St. Joseph's Cemetery. His headstone was later erected that year by Irish members of the 8th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, then encamped in Thibodaux.Irish-American Index He was married to Elizabeth Connolly, with whom he had two children.

Born in Somerset, he came to New Zealand early in his life via Australia. A butcher by trade, he later worked in trade and export. He was for many years a member of Christchurch City Council. After his wife died, he lived with his daughter in Victoria, Australia. Early life Cooper was born in Somerset in circa 1845. He emigrated to Australia in 1852 and shortly after that went to New Zealand. Professional life In Christchurch, he joined the firm of Messrs Hopkins and Co., butchers, as their manager. Three years later, he left Hopkins and Co, and bought the business from an estate. He worked in wholesale and export trade until he retired in 1893. Political career Cooper first stood for Christchurch City Council in September 1888, when he defeated Henry Thomson in the North-East Ward. A mayoral election was held on 28 November 1894. The incumbent, Thomas Gapes, stood again and was challenged by two sitting councillors, Cooper and Edward Smith. Cooper, Gapes, and Smith received 587, 364, and 246 votes, respectively. Cooper was thus declared elected, and was installed as mayor on 19 December 1894. His election as mayor left a vacancy, which was filled by William Epthorp Samuels. At the end of his term as mayor, Cooper did not stand for re-election. The mayoralty was contested by two city councillors, Harry Beswick and Howell Widdowson. Beswick was successful, and he was installed on 18 December 1895. In November 1896, nominations were called for the next mayoral election. For a while, councillor John Tippett Smith was the only candidate. A large and influential deputation requested Cooper to stand again, to which he acceded. On 25 November 1896, Cooper won the election, and he was installed on 17 December. Cooper's return caused a by-election in the North-East Ward, and Dr Adam Mickle was returned unopposed. Cooper did not stand again at the end of his second term, but Charles Louisson, a former mayor, was asked to stand again for mayor in September 1897. Louisson was elected unopposed on 16 November and installed on 15 December. Cooper was a member of various organisations. He was chairman of the Conciliation Board, the St. John Ambulance Association, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He was a member of the Charitable Aid Board and Domain Board. Death His wife Catherine died on 7 November 1922. Cooper moved to his daughter, Elsie Lee Rawlings, in Upper Maffra, Victoria, Australia, and he died at his daughter's residence on 17 April 1941, aged 96. He was cremated at Springvale.

Note: This includes History The first Quaker meeting in Birmingham Township was held about 1690. In 1718 a meetinghouse was built from red cedar logs. A burial ground, surrounded by a stone wall, was established in the 1750s. The building was made out of stone in 1763 and measured 38 by 41 feet. During the Battle of Brandywine, the British forces attempted to flank the Continental forces under General George Washington. The Continental forces rushed north to meet the British in the area of the meetinghouse. It was used as a hospital first for the Americans, and after the battle for British officers. The stone wall around the cemetery was used as a defensive position by the Americans. After the battle, dead British and American soldiers shared a common grave in the cemetery. The meetinghouse was enlarged in 1819 and an octagonal school was completed in August, 1819 at a cost of $712.57. The school was used off and on through 1905 and is included in the NRHP site.

Beswick Jr received his education at Christ's College in Christchurch. Beswick played rugby union for Christchurch Football Club and also played for the Canterbury representative team. On 25 October 1899, Beswick married Florence Ethel Mills (known as Florence) at St. Matthew's Church in Dunedin. She was the second daughter of James Mills, the founder of the Union Steam Ship Company in Dunedin. Professional life After school, he trained at Harper and Harper, solicitors in Christchurch.

History The Kennett Monthly Meeting house known as Old Kennett was first constructed in 1710 on land owned by Ezekiel Harlan, deeded from William Penn. Kennett and Marlboro Townships were being colonized by farming Quaker families who joined with members of New Castle Meeting, Hockessin Meeting and Centre Meeting (near Centerville Delaware) every four to six weeks for business meetings at Newark (New Ark) Meeting. Then, as Newark Meeting dwindled away, the Meetings united at the Old Kennett Meeting house, which then came to bear the name of Newark after the meeting of that name ceased to exist. In May, 1760, the named changed as Friends of Newark Monthly Meeting requested that the name be altered from Newark to that of Kennett. Note: This includes During the Revolutionary War these Quakers adopted an official attitude of neutrality, but it was in the cemetery adjoining the Old Kennett Meeting House that the first shots of the Battle of the Brandywine were fired on September 11, 1777. Although the British and Hessian forces were surprised as they came, 5000 strong, from Kennett that morning, the small American force led by General Maxwell was driven back to the north hills of Chadds Ford. The soldiers killed in the battle that afternoon are buried in the adjoining Old Kennett Cemetery. During the nineteenth century the membership of Kennett Meeting suffered divisions. The first was in 1812 when a new Kennett Meeting was formed within the Borough of Kennett Square. Then in 1827 Friends split into conservative and liberal sects and by 1828 there were separate Kennett Monthly Meetings. The liberal group, the Hicksites, named after Elias Hicks, retained the old Kennett Meeting while the conservative Friends established Parkersville Friends Meetinghouse which was used until 1904. Although Quakers had released their slaves before the revolution, and worked to change the laws, those who could not agree to holding public anti-slavery meetings in the Meeting House made ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù friends so impatient that they left to form their own meeting. The Progressive Friends built the Longwood Meeting House and were disowned until 1874. The meetinghouse has hosted visitors including Lucretia Mott, William Lloyd Garrison, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Harriet Tubman. Gradually the membership of Old Kennett Meeting dwindled until in the early 1920s Meetings for Worship might have only one or two members sitting in the stillness of the ancient building. Since 1950 the Old Kennett Committee of Kennett Meeting (Kennett Square) has maintained the building, opening it for worship on the last Sunday of June, July, and August at 11 a.m. In July 1974 the Old Kennett Meeting house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, making it nationally recognized as a historically and architecturally significant structure. Old Kennett's tercentennial was celebrated in 2010 with a lecture series and historical tours being held at the meetinghouse. The meetinghouse is still open for Quaker Meeting-for- Worship on the last Sundays of June, July and August at 9:00 am and for occasional weddings, funerals and other events.

It is a mission of Our Lady of Consolation of Parkesburg. The church with its adjoining cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1985. The church is remarkable for its simplicity, resembling a Quaker meeting house more than a Catholic parish church. It is a rectangular one story stone stucco-covered building. History The church has never had a resident priest, remaining a mission since its founding. Early services were conducted by visiting missionaries. In 1840 it became a mission church of St. Agnes Church in West Chester according to the NRHP nomination form. Later it was a mission of parishes in Parkesburg and Coatesville. The congregation was founded in the eighteenth century. The earliest standing tombstone bears the date 1771 and marks the grave of Thomas Maguire. The land was donated to the church in 1794 by Andrew Maguire. An attempt to build a church started in 1800. The building was completed in 1838 next to the cemetery on the Maguire farm. John Ferron, owner of the NRHP-listed John Ferron House, was the carpenter for the church. Henry Ferron and the Maguire family were the stone masons. Note: This includes Major improvements were made to the building in 1865, and again in 1937, in preparation for the church's centennial. Electricity and central heating were installed sometime after 1973. In the early 1990s major roof repairs were made, air conditioning was added and a port-a-potty was brought in. Indoor plumbing was added later. The first mass was celebrated on January 1, 1839 by Father James A. Miller. The first pastor, Father Bernard McCabe, was soon appointed and he also served missions in Coatesville, about seven miles north of the church, and Parkesburg, about eight miles northwest. The first confirmation was conferred in 1843 by Bishop Francis Kenrick. St. John Neumann conferred another confirmation in 1854. In 1853 the Seven Dolors church, now Our Lady of Consolation, was built in Parkesburg, and St. Malachi became a mission of Seven Dolors. Between 1871 and 1902 both Seven Dolors and St. Malachi were missions of St. Cecilia‚Äôs in Coatesville. In 1902 Seven Dolors again became a self-supporting parish and served the mission of St. Malachi. Services at St. Malachi had been celebrated irregularly in the 1930s and 1940s and starting in 1952 were scheduled only three or four times annually. Starting in 1963 services were scheduled monthly and beginning in 1973, weekly. The church is unusual in Chester County, an early stronghold of Quakerism in the Quaker colony of Pennsylvania. Irish had settled in the area before 1730, but they were Presbyterians and Quakers. About 1730 Presbyterians established a well-known church and religious school at Faggs Manor about five miles southwest of St. Malachi. In 1757 there were only 55 Irish Catholics (32 male, 23 female) counted in Chester County.Note that Chester County then included the areas now occupied by both Chester and Delaware Counties.

He was noted for his facility at word play, logic, and fantasy. The poems Jabberwocky and The Hunting of the Snark are classified in the genre of literary nonsense. He was also a mathematician, photographer, inventor and Anglican deacon. Carroll came from a family of high-church Anglicans, and developed a long relationship with Christ Church, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. Alice Liddell, daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, Henry Liddell, is widely identified as the original for Alice in Wonderland, though Carroll always denied this. Speculation about the nature of his relationships with children has foundered on lack of evidence. In 1982, a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. There are Lewis Carroll societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works.Lewis Carroll Society of North America Inc. Charity Navigator. Retrieved 7 October Background and early life Lewis Carroll Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English (with Irish connections), conservative and high-church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin.Clark, p. 10 His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.Collingwood, pp. 6‚Äì7 The older of these sons ‚Äì yet another Charles Dodgson ‚Äì was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1830 and became a country parson.Collingwood, p. 8Cohen, pp. 30‚Äì35 Dodgson was born in All Saints' Vicarage at Daresbury, Cheshire, near Warrington, the eldest boy and the third child. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining toward Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambivalent relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.Cohen, pp. 200‚Äì202 Education Lewis Carroll self-portrait c. 1856 Home life During his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His \\"reading lists\\" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as The Pilgrim's Progress. He also spoke with a stammer ‚Äì a condition shared by most of his siblingsCohen, p. 4 ‚Äì that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of Richmond School) in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Rugby In 1846, Dodgson entered Rugby School where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving: Dodgson did not claim he suffered from bullying but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby. Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, who was Dodgson's nephew, wrote that \\"even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause\\", which is the protection of the smaller boys. Scholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. \\"I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby\\", observed mathematics master R. B. Mayor.Collingwood, p. 29 Francis Walkingame's The Tutor's Assistant; Being a Compendium of Arithmetic ‚Äì the mathematics textbook that the young Dodgson used ‚Äì still survives and it contained an inscription in Latin, which translates to: \\"This book belongs to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson: hands off!\\" Some pages also included annotations such as the one found in p. 129, where he wrote \\"Not a fair question in decimals\\" next to a question. Oxford He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and matriculated at the University of Oxford in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, Christ Church.Clark, pp. 63‚Äì64 After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.Clark, pp. 64‚Äì65 He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of \\"inflammation of the brain\\" ‚Äì perhaps meningitis or a stroke ‚Äì at the age of 47. His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained first-class honours in Mathematics Moderations and was shortly thereafter nominated to a Studentship by his father's old friend Canon Edward Pusey.Collingwood, p. 52Clark, p. 74 In 1854, he obtained first- class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, graduating Bachelor of Arts.Collingwood, p. 57Wilson, p. 51 He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.Cohen, p. 51Clark, p. 79 Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855, which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.Cohen, pp. 414‚Äì416 Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson was to remain at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death, including that of Sub-Librarian of the Christ Church library, where his office was close to the Deanery, where Alice Liddell lived.Leach, Ch. 2. Character and appearance=Health problems 1863 photograph of Carroll by Oscar G. Rejlander The young adult Charles Dodgson was about tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. In early childhood, he acquired a stammer, which he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\"; it remained throughout his life. The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.Leach, p. 91 Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many supposed facts often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation. Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades. Social connections In the interim between his early published writings and the success of the Alice books, Dodgson began to move in the pre-Raphaelite social circle. He first met John Ruskin in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863, he developed a close relationship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in Chelsea, London. He also knew William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Arthur Hughes, among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author George MacDonald well ‚Äì it was the enthusiastic reception of Alice by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.Cohen, pp. 100‚Äì4 Politics, religion, and philosophy In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\"Collingwood When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added: Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \\"Practical Tortoise Raising\\". Artistic activities One of Carroll's own illustrations Literature From a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine Mischmasch and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications The Comic Times and The Train, as well as smaller magazines such as the Whitby Gazette and the Oxford Critic. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. \\"I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the Whitby Gazette or the Oxonian Advertiser), but I do not despair of doing so someday,\\" he wrote in July 1855. Sometime after 1850, he did write puppet plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: La Guida di Bragia. In March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called \\"Solitude\\" appeared in The Train under the authorship of \\"Lewis Carroll\\". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: Lewis was the anglicised form of Ludovicus, which was the Latin for Lutwidge, and Carroll an Irish surname similar to the Latin name Carolus, from which comes the name Charles. The transition went as follows: \\"Charles Lutwidge\\" translated into Latin as \\"Carolus Ludovicus\\". This was then translated back into English as \\"Carroll Lewis\\" and then reversed to make \\"Lewis Carroll\\".Roger Lancelyn Green On-line Encyclop√¶dia Britannica This pseudonym was chosen by editor Edmund Yates from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.Thomas, p. 129 =Alice books= \\"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo\\". Illustration by John Tenniel, 1865. The Jabberwock, as illustrated by John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, including the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\". In 1856, Dean (i.e., head of the college) Henry Liddell arrived at Christ Church, bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years, and would greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own \\"Alice\\" from Alice Liddell; the acrostic poem at the end of Through the Looking-Glass spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his \\"little heroine\\" was based on any real child,Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) The Letters of Lewis Carroll, London: Macmillan.Leach, Ch. 5 \\"The Unreal Alice\\" and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. Gertrude Chataway's name appears in this form at the beginning of The Hunting of the Snark, and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her. Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858‚Äì1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend to nearby Nuneham Courtenay or Godstow.Leach, Ch. 4 It was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864. Before this, the family of friend and mentor George MacDonald read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected ‚Äì Alice Among the Fairies and Alice's Golden Hour ‚Äì the work was finally published as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier. The illustrations this time were by Sir John Tenniel; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.Gardner, Martin (2000). \\"The Annotated Alice. The Definitive Edition\\". New York: W.W. Norton.Heath, Peter (1974). \\"The Philosopher's Alice\\". New York: St. Martin's Press. Critical literature has often proposed Freudian interpretations of the book as \\"a descent into the dark world of the subconscious\\", as well as seeing it as a satire upon contemporary mathematical advances. The overwhelming commercial success of the first Alice book changed Dodgson's life in many ways. The fame of his alter ego \\"Lewis Carroll\\" soon spread around the world. He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, Queen Victoria herself enjoyed Alice in Wonderland so much that she commanded that he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled An Elementary Treatise on Determinants.Wilson Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting \\"... It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred\\"; and it is unlikely for other reasons. As T. B. Strong comments in a Times article, \\"It would have been clean contrary to all his practice to identify [the] author of Alice with the author of his mathematical works\\". He also began earning quite substantial sums of money but continued with his seemingly disliked post at Christ Church. Late in 1871, he published the sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives \\"1872\\" as the date of publication.) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects changes in Dodgson's life. His father's death in 1868 plunged him into a depression that lasted some years. =The Hunting of the Snark= In 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, The Hunting of the Snark, a fantastical \\"nonsense\\" poem exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of nine tradesmen and one beaver, who set off to find the snark. It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers, but was enormously popular with the public, having been reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908, and has seen various adaptations into musicals, opera, theatre, plays and music. Painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti reputedly became convinced that the poem was about him. =Sylvie and Bruno= In 1895, 30 years after the publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the fairy siblings Sylvie and Bruno. Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. Sylvie and Bruno came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century. Photography (1856‚Äì1880)  Photo of Alice Liddell taken by Lewis Carroll (1858) In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle Skeffington Lutwidge, and later of his Oxford friend Reginald Southey.Clark, p. 93 He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years. A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing. Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.Cohen, Morton (1999). \\"Reflections in a Looking Glass.\\" New York: Aperture. His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures. He also found photography to be a useful entr√©e into higher social circles.Thomas, p. 116 During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as John Everett Millais, Ellen Terry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Julia Margaret Cameron, Michael Faraday, Lord Salisbury, and Alfred Tennyson. By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.Thomas, p. 265 He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly. Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced. Inventions To promote letter writing, Dodgson invented \\"The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case\\" in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the Cheshire Cat on the back. It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils; Carroll expressly notes in Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own. The pack included a copy of a pamphlet version of this lecture.Flodden W. Heron, \\"Lewis Carroll, Inventor of Postage Stamp Case\\" in Stamps, vol. 26, no. 12, 25 March 1939 Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 euro cent. Another invention was a writing tablet called the nyctograph that allowed note-taking in the dark, thus eliminating the need to get out of bed and strike a light when one woke with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and a system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the Graffiti writing system on a Palm device.Everson, Michael. (2011) \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: An edition printed in the Nyctographic Square Alphabet devised by Lewis Carroll\\". Foreword by Alan Tannenbaum, √âire: Cathair na Mart. He also devised a number of games, including an early version of what today is known as Scrabble. He appears to have invented ‚Äì or at least certainly popularized ‚Äì the \\"doublet\\" (see word ladder), a form of brain- teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG. The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. Other items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociam (a type of tricycle); fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the Senior Common Room at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double- sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two ciphers for cryptography. He also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation. He proposed the so-called Dodgson's method, using the Condorcet method. In 1884, he proposed a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts, each voter casting only a single vote, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through what is now called Liquid democracy.Charles Dodgson, Principles of Parliamentary Representation (1884)) Mathematical work A posthumous portrait of Lewis Carroll by Hubert von Herkomer, based on photographs. This painting now hangs in the Great Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. Within the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of geometry, linear and matrix algebra, mathematical logic, and recreational mathematics, producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g., the first printed proof of the Kronecker‚ÄìCapelli theorem),Abeles, Francine F. (1998) Charles L. Dodgson, Mathematician\\". An Exhibition From the Jon A. Lindseth Collection of C.L. Dodgson and Lewis Carroll\\". New York:The Grolier Club, pp. 45‚Äì54. probability, and the study of elections (e.g., Dodgson's method) and committees; some of this work was not published until well after his death. His occupation as Mathematical Lecturer at Christ Church gave him some financial security.Wilson, p. 61 His mathematical work attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Dodgson's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Dodgson's contributions to symbolic logic.Gardner, Martin. (1958) \\"Logic Machines and Diagrams\\". Brighton, Sussex:Harvester PressBartley, William Warren III, ed. (1977) \\"Lewis Carroll's Symbolic Logic\\". New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 2nd ed 1986.Moktefi, Amirouche. (2008) \\"Lewis Carroll's Logic\\", pp. 457‚Äì505 in British Logic in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 4 of Handbook of the History of Logic, Dov M. Gabbay and John Woods (eds.) Amsterdam: Elsevier. It is recognized that in his Symbolic Logic Part II, Dodgson introduced the Method of Trees, the earliest modern use of a truth tree. Robbins' and Rumsey's investigation of Dodgson condensation, a method of evaluating determinants, led them to the alternating sign matrix conjecture, now a theorem. The discovery in the 1990s of additional ciphers that Dodgson had constructed, in addition to his \\"Memoria Technica\\", showed that he had employed sophisticated mathematical ideas in their creation. Correspondence Dodgson wrote and received as many as 98,721 letters, according to a special letter register which he devised. He documented his advice about how to write more satisfying letters in a missive entitled \\"Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing\\". Later years Lewis Carroll in later life Dodgson's existence remained little changed over the last twenty years of his life, despite his growing wealth and fame. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. Public appearances included attending the West End musical Alice in Wonderland (the first major live production of his Alice books) at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 30 December 1886. The two volumes of his last novel, Sylvie and Bruno, were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the Alice books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002). Lewis Carroll: Through the Looking Glass. Lerner. p. 98..Christensen, Thomas (1991). \\"Dodgson's Dodges\\". rightreading.com. The only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastic, together with the Reverend Henry Liddon. He recounts the travel in his \\"Russian Journal\\", which was first commercially published in 1935. On his way to Russia and back, he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, partitioned Poland, and France. Death The grave of Lewis Carroll at the Mount Cemetery in Guildford Dodgson died of pneumonia following influenza on 14 January 1898 at his sisters' home, \\"The Chestnuts\\", in Guildford in the county of Surrey, just four days before the death of Henry Liddell. He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. His funeral was held at the nearby St Mary's Church.Lewis Carroll and St Mary's Church ‚Äì Guildford: This Is Our Town website His body was buried at the Mount Cemetery in Guildford. He is commemorated at All Saints' Church, Daresbury, in its stained glass windows depicting characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Controversies and mysteries=Discussion of Dodgson's sexual preferences Some late twentieth-century biographers have suggested that Dodgson's interest in children had an erotic element, including Morton N. Cohen in his Lewis Carroll: A Biography (1995),Cohen, pp. 166‚Äì167, 254‚Äì255 Donald Thomas in his Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background (1995), and Michael Bakewell in his Lewis Carroll: A Biography (1996). Cohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's \\"sexual energies sought unconventional outlets\\", and further writes: Lewis Carroll portrait of Beatrice Hatch Cohen goes on to note that Dodgson \\"apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any eroticism\\", but adds that \\"later generations look beneath the surface\\" (p. 229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained \\"break\\" with the family in June 1863, an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and Roger Lancelyn Green stop short of identifying Dodgson as a paedophile (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world. Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as \\"the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover\\". Several other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. Hugues Lebailly has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the \\"Victorian Child Cult\\", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence. Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time, and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including Oscar Gustave Rejlander and Julia Margaret Cameron. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian Christmas cards, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time. Karoline Leach's reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea ‚Äì fostered by Dodgson's various biographers ‚Äì that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson \\"the Carroll Myth\\". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as \\"child-friends\\" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.Leach, pp. 16‚Äì17 She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.Leach, p. 33 In addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well ‚Äì in particular, Dennis Potter in his play Alice and his screenplay for the motion picture Dreamchild, and Robert Wilson in his musical Alice. Ordination Dodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the Church of England from a very early age and was expected to be ordained within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22‚Äì24 October 1862 Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time. There is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.Cohen, p. 263 Wilson quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words.Wilson, pp. 103‚Äì104 But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice. Wilson also points out that the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of F. D. Maurice) and \\"alternative\\" religions (theosophy).Leach, p. 134 Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a \\"vile and worthless\\" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text Missing diaries At least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.Leach, pp. 48, 51 The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.Leach, pp. 48‚Äì51 Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21‚Äì31 years old).Leach, p. 52 This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems may have been autobiographical.Leach p. 54 Many theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest that this was so, and a paper offers some evidence to the contrary which was discovered by Karoline Leach in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. \\"Cut Pages in Diary\\". (For an account of its discovery see The Times Literary Supplement, 3 May 1996.) The \\"cut pages in diary\\" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking This paper is known as the \\"cut pages in diary document\\", and was compiled by various members of Carroll's family after his death. Part of it may have been written at the time when the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson that there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's governess, as well as about his relationship with \\"Ina\\", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The \\"break\\" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.Leach, pp. 170‚Äì2. An alternative interpretation has been made regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with \\"Ina\\": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all; until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt. Migraine and epilepsy In his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of migraine with aura, describing very accurately the process of \\"moving fortifications\\" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) \\"The Diaries of Lewis Carroll\\", Vol. 9, p. 52 Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine per se, or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called Alice in Wonderland syndrome has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as micropsia and macropsia, a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did. Dodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an \\"epileptiform\\" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned. Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for \\"quite sometime afterward\\". This attack was diagnosed as possibly \\"epileptiform\\" and Carroll himself later wrote of his \\"seizures\\" in the same diary. Most of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 The Mystery of Lewis Carroll, is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information. Legacy Lewis Carroll memorial window (Mad Hatter and March Hare pictured) at All Saints' Church, Daresbury, Cheshire There are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life. Copenhagen Street in Islington, north London is the location of the Lewis Carroll Children's Library. In 1982, his great-nephew unveiled a memorial stone to him in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. In January 1994, an asteroid, 6984 Lewiscarroll, was discovered and named after Carroll. The Lewis Carroll Centenary Wood near his birthplace in Daresbury opened in 2000. Born in All Saints' Vicarage, Daresbury, Cheshire, in 1832, Lewis Carroll is commemorated at All Saints' Church, Daresbury in its stained glass windows depicting characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In March 2012, the Lewis Carroll Centre, attached to the church, was opened.

Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid 2,000 BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of metal- working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the late Bronze Age civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt. Development of glass technology in India may have begun in 1,730 BC. In Ancient China glass-making had a later start compared to ceramics and metal work. From across the former Roman Empire archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry. Origins Ancient Greek glass amphora from the Hellenistic period. Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt. Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. During the Late Bronze Age in Egypt (e.g., the Ahhotep \\"Treasure\\") and Western Asia (e.g., Megiddo),These early examples are drawn from there was a rapid growth in glassmaking technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads. The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash (sodium carbonate), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants like saltwort. The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it by reheating it several times. Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth (marvered) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds. Much of early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.Wilde, H. \\"Technologische Innovationen im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr. Zur Verwendung und Verbreitung neuer Werkstoffe im ostmediterranen Raum\\". GOF IV, Bd 44, Wiesbaden 2003, 25‚Äì26. By the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in Western Asia, Crete, and Egypt; and the Mycenaean Greek term , ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i, meaning \\"workers of lapis lazuli and glass\\" (written in Linear b syllabic script) is attested.Wilde, H. \\"Technologische Innovationen im 2.

Patrick (2007) Prehistory and history of glassmaking technology, American Ceramic Society, It is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials were a closely guarded technological secret reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the Ulu Burun shipwreck off the coast of modern Turkey. An early 18th-century goblet with coats of arms in the District Museum in Tarn√≥w is one of the highest (54.3 cm, 21.4 in) preserved examples of artistry of less known Lubacz√≥w glass manufacturing factory. The goblet was almost entirely covered with a pattern of so-called carp scales and hand-engraved decoration. Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seemed to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking \\"manual\\" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in cuneiform tablets discovered in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. In Egypt, glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the Hellenistic period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' viscous (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and 'millefiori' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully. According to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River. Georgius Agricola, in De re metallica, reported a traditional serendipitous \\"discovery\\" tale of familiar type: > \\"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with nitrum being moored at > this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not > having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the > ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed > streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of > glass.\\"Agricola, Georgius, De re metallica, translated by Herbert Clark > Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, Dover Publishing. De Re Metallica Trans. by > Hoover Online Version Page 586. Retrieved September 12, 2007 This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC, glass blowing was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry. Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. Growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world. Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond. During the post-classical times, glass and glass beads were also produced in the kingdom of Benin.Oliver, Roland, and Fagan, Brian M. Africa in the Iron Age, c500 B.C. to A.D. 1400. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 187. . History by culture=Iran The first Persian glass comes in the form of beads dating to the late Bronze Age (1600 BC), and was discovered during the explorations of Dinkhah Tepe in Iranian Azerbaijan by Charles Burney. Glass tubes were discovered by French archaeologists at Chogha Zanbil, belonging to the middle Elamite period. Mosaic glass cups have also been found at Teppe Hasanlu and Marlik Tepe in northern Iran, dating to the Iron Age. These cups resembles ones from Mesopotamia, as do cups found in Susa during the late Elamite period. Glass tubes containing kohl have also been found in Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan Province, belonging to the Achaemenid period. During this time, glass vessels were usually plain and colorless. By the Seleucid and late Parthian era, Greek and Roman techniques were prevalent. During the Sasanian period, glass vessels were decorated with local motifs. India Evidence of glass during the chalcolithic has been found in Hastinapur, India. The earliest glass item from the Indus Valley Civilization is a brown glass bead found at Harappa, dating to 1700 BC. This makes it the earliest evidence of glass in South Asia. Glass discovered from later sites dating from 600 to 300 BC displays common colors. Texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana and Vinaya Pitaka mention glass, implying they could have been known in India during the early first millennium BC. Glass objects have also been found at Beed, Sirkap and Sirsukh, all dating to around the 5th century BC. However, the first unmistakable evidence for widespread glass usage comes from the ruins of Taxila (3rd century BC), where bangles, beads, small vessels, and tiles were discovered in large quantities. These glassmaking techniques may have been transmitted from cultures in Western Asia. The site of Kopia, in Uttar Pradesh, is the first site in India to locally manufacture glass, with items dating between the 7th century BC to the 2nd century AD. Early Indian glass of this period was likely made locally, as they differ significantly in chemical composition when compared to Babylonian, Roman and Chinese glass. By the 1st century AD, glass was being used for ornaments and casing in South Asia. Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and Indians artisans mastered several techniques of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the succeeding centuries. The Satavahana period of India also produced short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass. China Blue glass plaques found in the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King, dating from late 2nd century BC In China, glass played a peripheral role in arts and crafts when compared to ceramics and metal work.Braghin, C. (2002) \\"Introduction\\" pp. XI-XIV in Braghin, C. (ed) Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.). . The earliest glass items in China come from the Warring States period (475 BC‚Äì221 BC), although they are rare in number and limited in archaeological distribution. Glassmaking developed later in China compared to cultures in Mesopotamia, Egypt and India.Pinder-Wilson, R. (1991) \\"The Islamic lands and China\\" p. 140 in Tait, H. (ed) Five thousand years of glass. University of Pennsylvania Press. Imported glass objects first reached China during the late Spring and Autumn period (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome eye beads.Braghin, C. (2002) \\"Polychrome and monochrome glass of the Warring States and Han periods\\" p. 6 in Braghin, C. (ed) Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.). These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD), the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects. Chinese glass objects from the Warring States and Han period vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of barium oxide and lead, distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.Kerr, R. and Wood, N. (2004) \\"Part XII: Ceramic technology\\" pp. 474‚Äì477 in Science and Civilisation in China. Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology. Cambridge University Press. At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.An Jiayao (2002) \\"Polychrome and monochrome glass of the Warring States and Han periods\\" pp. 45‚Äì46 in Braghin, C. (ed) Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.). . Literary sources also mention the manufacture of glass during the 5th century AD.Jenyns, R. (1981) Chinese Art III: Textiles, Glass and Painting on Glass. Phaidon Press Romans Roman glass Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely colored cast glass vessels. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, funerary and industrial contexts. Glass was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. However, during the 1st century AD, the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colorless or ‚Äòaqua‚Äô glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels,Fleming, S. J., 1999. Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change. Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing, primarily in Alexandria,Toner, J. P. (2009) Popular culture in ancient Rome. . p. 19 resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world. Islamic world Islamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the Sasanian glass of Persia. The Arab poet al-Buhturi (820‚Äì897) described the clarity of such glass: \\"Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container.\\"Hassan, Ahmad Y, Assessment of Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna , History of Science and Technology in Islam. In the 8th century, the Persian-Arab chemist JƒÅbir ibn HayyƒÅn (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in Kitab al- Durra al-Maknuna (The Book of the Hidden Pearl), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book.Hassan, Ahmad Y. The Manufacture of Coloured Glass , History of Science and Technology in Islam. By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Islamic Spain. Medieval Europe A 16th-century stained glass window After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, independent glass making technologies emerged in Northern Europe, with artisan forest glass produced by several cultures. Byzantine Glass evolved the Roman tradition, in the Eastern Empire. The claw beaker was popular as a relatively easy to make but an impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass. Glass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of Torcello near Venice. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000 AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: potash obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use. Until the 12th century, stained glass ‚Äì glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring ‚Äì was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for Romanesque art and especially Gothic art. Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings. The 11th century saw the emergence in Germany of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century Venice. The crown glass process was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the glassblower would spin approximately 9 pounds (4 kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as forest glass. =Anglo- Saxon world= Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.Bayley, J. (2000). \\"Glass-working in Early Medieval England\\" pp. 137‚Äì142 in Price, J. Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350‚Äì1100. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. In the 5th century AD with the Roman departure from Britain, there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.Evison, V. I. (2000). \\"Glass vessels in England, 400‚Äì1100 CE\\" pp. 47‚Äì104 in Price, J. Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350‚Äì1100. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. Excavation of Romano-British sites has revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from the 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule. The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries.Heyworth, M. (1992) \\"Evidence for early medieval glass-working in north-western Europe\\" pp. 169‚Äì174 in S. Jennings and A. Vince (eds) Medieval Europe 1992: Volume 3 Technology and Innovation. York: Medieval Europe 1992 There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiasticalEcclesiastical: Of or relating to a church or to an established religion. literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings. Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewelry, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.Bimson M. and Freestone, I.C. (2000). \\"Analysis of some glass from Anglo-Saxon Jewellery\\" pp. 137‚Äì142 in Price, J. Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350‚Äì1100. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. Bimson, M.

What made Venetian Murano glass significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with soda ash obtained from the Levant, for which the Venetians held the sole monopoly. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called obsidianus after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.Georg Agricola De Natura Fossilium, Textbook of Mineralogy, M.C. Bandy, J. Bandy, Mineralogical Society of America, 1955, p. 111 Section on Murano Glass, De Natura Fossilium. Retrieved 2007-09-12. The Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. Murano‚Äôs reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the city‚Äôs mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the island‚Äôs most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands. =Bohemia= Bohemian flashed and engraved ruby glass (19th-century) Bohemian glass, or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now in the current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century. Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (), Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov () and Nov√Ω Bor (). Both Nov√Ω Bor and Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels. Modern glass production=New processes Ravenscroft's glass. A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the \\"working period\\" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo, he used flint as a silica source, but his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt. He was granted a protective patent in where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames. By 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over Europe with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as Excise glasses. The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845. Evidence of the use of the blown plate glass method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting Polished plate glass in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown \\"sheet\\" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 11th edition (1911) This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at Ravenhead. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass. Industrial production The fa√ßade of the Crystal Palace, one of the first buildings to use glass as the main material for construction. The use of glass as a building material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton to house the Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker. This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers.Bontemps on Glassmaking: the Guide du Verrier of Georges Bontemps, translated by Michael Cable (2008). Society of Glass Technology. James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations. An early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer Henry Bessemer. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of \\"Float Glass\\" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin. In 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in Castleford, Yorkshire. This semi- automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture. Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888. Pilkington's factory, where the float glass process was developed in the 1950s. In 1898, Pilkington invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer \\"Georgian Wired Glass\\" but it greatly post- dates the Georgian era. The Machine Drawn Cylinder technique was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by Pilkington from 1910 onwards. In 1938, the polished plate process was improved by Pilkington which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary float glass process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate\\"Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT¬Æ\\". SCHOTT AG. and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight.Bickerstaff, Kenneth and Pilkington, Lionel A B \\"Manufacture of flat glass\\". Priority date December 10, 1953 Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.

Naming Homopus areolatus is known by a wide range of common names. In its native region in southern Africa (and in much of the scientific community) it is usually known as the common padloper due to its being by far the most commonly occurring of all the Homopus (\\"padloper\\") species.Loehr, V., \\"Common Padloper (Homopus areolatus)\\", World Chelonian Trust (retrieved August 20, 2013)Homopus Research Foundation website It is also commonly known as the parrot-beaked tortoise, due to the relatively large beak that the males of the species possess.Parrot-beaked tortoise, CITES species gallery.Homopus areolatus (Beaked Cape Tortoise), ZipcodeZoo.com.Slavens, F. and K. Slavens (1991). Reptiles and Amphibians in Captivity ‚Äì Breeding, Longevity and Inventory.The Herpetology Sourcebook, Reptile & Amphibian Magazine, 1996-1997. Other names include the older name of beaked Cape tortoise,IUCN Appendix 1. Regional Species Lists as well as areolated tortoise. The latter name refers to its species name \\"areolatus\\", and describes the raised rings around the scutes of its shell. Description 19th century plate from \\"A Monograph of the Testudinata\\" The common padloper is a small, rather flat tortoise. Its shell usually has varied colouration, ranging between olive-green and brown. The shields of the carapace are flat, with large raised areolae, and a thin black edging. Like its larger relative, the greater padloper, and unlike the other padlopers, it has only four toes on its front feet, as well as its hind feet. The average length is 110 mm, though females are larger than males. Their adult weight ranges from 140-300 g. It has a sharp, distinctly hooked beak. Orange-brown male, showing the larger, pointed head and beak The males are smaller than the females, and can be distinguished by their slightly longer tails and their distinctive heads. Males have larger heads, with a larger beak and a more pointy snout. The noses of dominant males also become bright orange or red in the breeding season. In colour, males are frequently uniformly orange to light brown (compared to the deeper olive brown of the females). Males also have more lightly coloured bellies, though they do not exhibit the plastral concavity that many other tortoise species do.R. Boycott, O. Bourquin: The South African Tortoise Book. Southern Book Publishers: Johannesburg. 1988. Distribution and habitat It is endemic to the Republic of South Africa and is found specifically in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces. Here it favours coastal lowlands, especially along the south coast, in fynbos, strandveld, albany thicket and valley bushveld. The mild climate allows it to stay active throughout the year. It is generally intolerant of the arid conditions further inland. At certain points, favourable conditions allow populations to survive further inland. In the Western Cape, there are inland populations at Sutherland and Nieuwoudtville. In the Eastern Cape, their range extends inland at one point, as far as Cradock. Unlike the other padloper species, Homopus areolatus is relatively plentiful within its range, and hence the name \\"common padloper\\". Due to its tiny size, this tortoise is heavily preyed on by crows, ostriches, jackals, baboons, dogs, and a wide range of other predators. Consequently, it spends most of its time hiding under rocks, foliage, and other cover. It lays a clutch of 2‚Äì4 eggs, which hatch 150‚Äì320 days later ‚Äì usually on a misty, overcast day.E.H.W. Baard: Cape Tortoises: Their identification and care. Cape Nature Conservation. 1994. Threats and conservation Injured beaked padloper, in an urban environment The species is threatened by habitat destruction, traffic on roads, and increased frequency of wildfires. Another threat comes from introduced species, such as domestic dogs and pigs.Biodiversity.orgMembres.multimania.fr (Retrieved March 17, 2010). Trade in collected Homopus species is strictly illegal in South Africa and Namibia. Any captive specimens are systematically registered in noncommercial studbooks, and any commercial sale of Homopus tortoises is almost without exception strictly illegal. Captivity The species can adapt well to captivity ‚Äì as its diet, while varied, is not highly specialized. It is, however, relatively rare as a pet.Corton, M., Homopus (Padloper Tortoise) Care, World Chelonian Trust (retrieved August 20, 2013). ReferencesFurther reading * Baard, E.H.W. 1996.

After the Revolution, he continued to fight for the land reform promised under the Mexican Constitution. Mexican Revolution Jaramillo was born in Tlaquiltenango, Morelos, in 1900. When he was 15 years old, he joined the Liberation Army of the South under the direct command of Emiliano Zapata. By age 17, Jaramillo had been promoted to the rank of captain and commanded 75 men. During the 1920s and 1930s, Jaramillo advocated on behalf of ejidos, grants of communally owned land by the federal government to farmers. He supported the 1934 presidential campaign of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, who created a cooperative sugar mill in Zacatepec in 1938 at Jaramillo's urging. Jaramillo was elected by the workers to help run the mill, but his advocacy on behalf of the workers led to frequent clashes with administrators appointed by the government. Jaramillista movement When workers at the Zacatepec sugar mill went on strike in 1943, Jaramillo persuaded the campesinos to stop producing cane for the mill. The state government ordered his arrest, so Jaramillo fled to the mountains and took up arms against the government. He and his followers, known as Jaramillistas, briefly took control of Tlaquiltenango. In 1944, President Manuel √Åvila Camacho invited Jaramillo to Mexico City to negotiate an end to the fighting. √Åvila granted amnesty to the Jaramillistas and guaranteed their safety. For the next nine years, Jaramillo fought for land reform within the electoral system. He founded the Agrarian Labor Party of Morelos (Partido Agrario Obrero Morelense, or PAOM), which quickly had 15,000 members. Jaramillo ran as its candidate for governor of Morelos in 1946 and 1952. Jaramillo lost both times, although he and his followers disputed the official election results. In 1953, Jaramillo again led an armed revolt against the government. For the next five years he and the Jaramillistas eluded the army. The army brought cavalry and artillery against the rebels, and it was assisted by the air force. Finally, amnesty was negotiated with President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos in 1958. L√≥pez Mateos had promised Jaramillo he would support the campesinos of Morelos, but Jaramillo was soon disappointed. When cattle ranchers began to take the land previously granted as ejidos, the federal government did nothing. Jaramillo led thousands of farmers in resistance. Jaramillo attempted to negotiate with the government on their behalf. While the government delayed, the campesinos occupied the land illegally. The government asked Jaramillo to help remove the squatters while the legal process continued; most of the farmers agreed. When the federal government ultimately turned down the farmers' request for assistance, Jaramillo appealed to L√≥pez Mateos but the president refused to meet with him. In 1961, the campesinos again occupied the land. This time, the army removed them. Death On May 23, 1962, Jaramillo's home was raided by a group of Federal Judicial Police and soldiers. He, his pregnant wife Epifan√≠a, and their three sons were taken to Xochicalco, Morelos, where they were killed. The only surviving member of the family was a daughter, who had fled to ask the town's mayor for help. A few days after the murders, Carlos Fuentes went to Xochicalco and wrote an article that was published in Siempre! (Always!), a popular magazine: > They pushed him down. Jaramillo could not hold himself back, he was a lion > of the field, that man.... He threw himself at the party of murderers; he > was defending his wife and his children, and especially the unborn child; > they brought him down with their rifle butts, they knocked out an eye. > Epifan√≠a flung herself on the murderers; they tore her rebozo, they tore her > dress, they threw her on the stones.

The election was called due to repeated attempts to oust the government of Marcus Stephen in votes of no-confidence. There were 86 candidates, eight of them women. Nauru uses a modified Borda count electoral system in eight multi- member districts. Background: the 'Getax affair' Australian officials have accused the Australian company Getax, which is an important buyer of Nauruan phosphate, of having precipitated the election by destabilising the Stephen government. Specifically, Getax had offered the Nauruan government a loan of A$25 million with a 15% interest rate, which, according to an investigative article in The Australian, \\"would be likely to have resulted in the country defaulting on its repayments, triggering contract provisions that would have let Getax take over the Nauru-owned phosphate industry\\". The Stephen government rejected the proferred loan. At the time, following the results of the 2008 election, the government had a parliamentary majority consisting in 12 MPs. Shortly thereafter, Getax organised and financed a trip to Singapore for the six opposition MPs and three of the government MPs. The latter three (including Aloysius Amwano) then joined the ranks of the opposition, causing a parliamentary stalemate, and thus the April election. In October 2010, The Australian published an article, based on revelations by Australian officials and on documents published by the Nauruan authorities, revealing Getax's activities, as well as seemingly inexplicable spending levels by opposition MPs, well beyond the means afforded by their salaries. It also included a testimony alleging that members of the opposition had paid sums of money to potential voters. Questioned by The Australian, Baron Waqa, leader of the opposition, would neither confirm nor deny the claim that Getax had financed the opposition's campaign, but stated: \\"Getax has always helped Nauru. [...] Getax is disappointed with the way the country is running\\". The Australian Federal Police launched an investigation into the accusations that Getax had bribed Nauruan officials (specifically, opposition and government non-Cabinet MPs) in the hopes that a new government would sign a deal with it on the selling of phosphate. Results and aftermath On 26 April, it was announced that provisional results indicated that every single one of the 18 members of parliament had been re-elected. This was confirmed on Monday 26 April, and the parliament met for a first session on Tuesday 27 April, to elect a speaker. However, all four nominated candidates were rejected. Parliament is now to resume on Thursday, with the Marcus Stephen administration continuing in a caretaker capacity. In its third sitting on 4 May 2010, the speaker election failed yet again. After a fourth failed attempt, the opposition floated the possibility of holding another election. Following the fifth failed attempt, Stephen proposed reforms before early elections, such as electing the speaker from outside parliament to break the deadlock. In a sixth attempt on 13 May 2010, Godfrey Thoma was finally elected speaker. He immediately proposed to dissolve parliament again. As the government refused to do this, he resigned on 18 May 2010; it seemed possible that the two camps might form a coalition government to break the deadlock. Progress was finally made when the government's nominee for speaker, Dominic Tabuna, was finally elected on 1 June 2010 in two rounds of balloting. Indirect presidential elections were then set for 3 June 2010. They were then postponed to 4 June 2010, and when they failed again on that date, Tabuna resigned. Following seven weeks of deadlock, parliament was dissolved on 11 June 2010 and an early election called for 19 June 2010.

They are the type genus of tribe Photinini in subfamily Lampyrinae. This genus contains, for example, the common eastern firefly (P. pyralis), the state insect of Tennessee, United States. Male Photinus beetles emit a flashing light pattern to signal for females. Illegitimate receivers, such as female Photuris beetles, identify these signals and use them to locate the male Photinus, attract them with deceptive signals, and eat them. Systematics The closest living relative of the rover fireflies is not yet determined with certainty. In morphology, they resemble their predators, the Photurinae, but they are quite certainly not at all closely related as fireflies go. Rather, the genus Ellychnia is either the closest relative of Photinus, or might even be included in it. Ellychnia are notable for having lost the ability to produce light again, and like the ancestors of all fireflies, communicate with pheromones only. It might thus be warranted to remove some species from Photinus and assign them different genera.Stanger-Hall et al. (2007) The genus Pyropyga is also a close relative, though it is certainly not as close as Ellychnia. This group makes up the core of the tribe Photinini, and in fact it seems warranted to restrict the tribe to these genera, but more research is still needed, in particular with regard to Photinus and Ellychnia, as the relationship of their type species (\\"Photinus pallens\\" and Ellychnia corrusca) remains completely unknown, with the latter also suspected to be a cryptic species complex.

The Gumbaynggirr Nation is from Tabbimoble Yamba- Clarence River to Ngambaa- Stuarts Point, SWR- Macleay. The Gumbaynggirr have the largest midden-shell deposit in the Southern Hemisphere. Language Gumbaynggiric languages Gumbaynggir is classified as one of the two Gumbaynggiric languages of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan family. In 1986 the Muurrbay Aboriginal Language and Culture Co- operative was established by Gumbaynggirr elders to revive their language and hand it on. Language classes began in 1997, and by 2010 some several hundred people had some partial grasp of the language. Culture Muurrbay in Gumbaynggir means the white fig tree and plays an important part in the Gumbaynggir Yuludarla (Gumbaynggir Dreamings). The Gumbaynggirr made sweets (bush lollies, called jaaning) by rolling tender shoots from the Acacia irrorata in the sap oozing from the tree. Country The Gumbaynggirr lands extend over an estimated covering an area of the Mid North Coast from the Nambucca River to as far north as the Clarence River (Grafton), and eastward to the Pacific coast. Norman Tindale specified its limits as bounded by the lower course of Nymboida River, stating that the territory ran toward Urunga, Coffs Harbour, and Bellingen. It included South Grafton and Glenreagh. It took in the coastal strip south from near One Tree Point, Woolgoolga and Nambucca Heads. The thin coastal zone from Coffs Harbour to Evans Head was Yaygir territory. To their north were the twenty groups speaking various dialects of the Bandjalang. The Jukambal were to their west and the Nganyaywana/Anƒìwan in the environs of (Armidale). Their southern boundaries met with those of the Djangadi and Ngamba. History J W. Lindt (c.1873-1874) Portrait of an Aboriginal man Clement Hodgkinson was the first European to make contact with the local Aboriginal community when he explored the upper reaches of the Nambucca and Bellinger Rivers in March 1841. Three decades later, loggers began to work their way up through the Orara River cedar stands in the 1870s. Over c.1873-1874 J.W. Lindt produced photographs of local indigenous people both in their environment and conducting actual traditional ceremonies in the Clarence River district, and made portraits in his studio. Contemporary commentary records them as \\"the first successful attempt at representing the native blacks truthfully as well as artistically.\\"Australian Town and Country Journal 5 December 1874, p.21 The Sydney Morning Herald, of 24 November 1874 expanded on what made the photographs attractive to Europeans; The report clearly sets out a cynical nostalgia for the traditional ways of these people made sentimental by noting their 'decreasing numbers', expressing a common attitude amongst the colonists that the indigenous populations were doomed. However, the individuals in Lindt's group portraits and their clans and languages (Gumbaynggirr and Bandjalung), are not named, the 'scenery' is generic, and the accessories not those of the people depicted. In clearing the land, the loggers opened up the prospect of selectors to squat on the tribal territories in the early 1880s. Soon after, in that same decade, a shepherd was murdered in the area and a hunting party was dispatched to exact revenge, resulting in the Red Rock Massacre. The slaughter started at Blackadder Creek where the Gumbaynggirr were camping. Mounted troopers entered the camp and began shooting. Those who fled were tracked down to the Corindi Creek where more were shot. Those who survived were driven to the headland and herded off the rocks into the sea. The hunters kept shooting at the swimmers, but some hid in a cave and made their way to Corindi Lake further south. One of the survivors was the present day elder Tony Perkins' grandmother, who crouched down in a thicket of bulrushes with a child in her arms. After a court battle lasting two decades, the Gumbaynggirr claim to much of the reserve around the site in 2014 was confirmed by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. Many reserves and missions was established in NSW by the Aboriginal protection board this resulted in relocation of aboriginals from their once called ancestry homes to only to be returned to home location after years of trauma, the land they stood on was altered for Whitemans usage later on. Current population Today current Gumbaynggirr population in the area of this tribe is about 18,000. The Gumbaynggir are an active people who recently represented themselves at the \\"New Way\\" Sovereignty Summit Canberra Conference convened by 1972 Aboriginal Tent Embassy.

In April 1865 it was permanently established to protect the area from Indian raids. Fort Dodge operated until 1882 and was then somewhat maintained by a custodian. The citizens of Dodge City worked to have a soldiers' home established on the old post. In 1889 President Grover Cleveland signed a bill allowing part of the military reservation to be used as a soldiers' home.\\"Fort Dodge Dispute Settled by Records: Authentic History Received from Washington: Established as Military Post in 1864, Became Fort in 1865, Soldiers' Home in 1886,\\" Topeka Daily Capital, June 28, 1931, p. 7B; \\"Kansas Soldiers' Home: Fort Dodge, Kansas\\" (N.p.: 1975), pp. 2, 7-8; Dr. V.

At any rate among the first occupants were American Civil War veterans, both Union and Confederate. Also, veterans of the Indian campaigns and the Mexican War were admitted.

New buildings were constructed to expand services. A cemetery was established to inter residents who died and needed a place to be buried. As of 2010 approximately 400 veterans were buried in the Kansas Soldiers' Home Cemetery. In 2002 a new cemetery was established, the Kansas Veterans' Cemetery at Fort Dodge.

Daxon has held numerous positions with the Oklahoma state government, including being elected Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector in 1978 and serving as the Oklahoma Secretary of Finance and Revenue under Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating. He was the Republican nominee for governor in the 1982 election, ultimately losing to Democratic incumbent George Nigh. Education and early career A native of Oklahoma City, Daxon earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Oklahoma State University (OSU) in 1970 and received his master's degree in geography from OSU in 1977. While in college, Daxon became an activist for the Oklahoma Republican Party. He served as the president of the Oklahoma State University College Republicans. After graduating from OSU, Daxon moved to Sand Springs, Oklahoma, and joined the Tulsa-based CPA firm of Hurdman and Cranstoun as an auditor. Oklahoma State Auditor In 1978, Daxon was elected Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector, unseating 20-year Democratic incumbent John M. Rogers. Rogers had allowed that office to decline to the point that the federal government was threatening to cut off federal funds. At the time of his election, Daxon was only 31 years old and was the only Republican to hold a statewide office in Oklahoma. Daxon raised the number of CPAs on his staff from only 1 to 26 while cutting the total office staff from 126 to 81. He formed an investigative unit that exposed questionable practices in certain license plate agencies and at the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. He introduced modern auditing techniques that included operational reviews of audited agencies and financial reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, leading Oklahoma to become the first state to issue comprehensive GAAP-basis general purpose financial statements, using its own staff. County Commissions scandal In 1981, Daxon cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its probe of many Oklahoma county commissioners. By the end of the investigation in 1984, more than 200 people (mostly county commissioners) from 60 of Oklahoma's 77 counties had been convicted of crimes. Most were convicted of taking kickbacks paid by suppliers on orders for county road-building supplies. More than 70 sitting commissioners had to resign in connection with the probe. 69 counties had commissioners resign in the wake of the probe, and 13 counties lost all three of their commissioners in connection with the scandal. 1982 gubernatorial campaign Daxon left the State Auditor's Office to become the Republican nominee for Governor of Oklahoma. Daxon challenged incumbent Democrat George Nigh. Nigh was ultimately successful in seeking reelection, defeating Daxon 62% to 38%. Work for Arthur Andersen Following his defeat in the gubernatorial election, in 1983, Daxon moved his family to McLean, Virginia, and joined accounting giant Arthur Andersen where he served as an adviser on government audits and accounting until 1990. In 1993 Daxon became the Manager of Quality Assurance for Arthur Andersen and oversaw major elements of the Resolution Trust Corporation. His team eliminated a nationally publicized backlog of unreconciled accounts and worked with outside auditors to obtain the RTC's first clean audit opinion. He was also responsible for special projects relating to privatization in state and local government for Arthur Andersen. Orange County Treasurer While employed by Arthur Anderson in 1994, Daxon was appointed as head of a delegation from the firm tasked with providing financial advice to Orange County, California, following an investment fund melt-down which resulted in the loss of at least $1.5 billion through high-risk investments in derivatives, the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history filed under Chapter 9 in December 1994, and the resignation and subsequent criminal prosecution of Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron. Upon arriving in Orange County later that month, he was appointed to a four-month term as interim county treasurer and oversaw the county's efforts to emerge from bankruptcy in June 1995. Keating Administration However, shortly after Republican Frank Keating was elected Governor of Oklahoma in November 1994, Keating had asked Daxon to be his budget director. For Daxon to be able to accept the California assignment, then Governor of California Pete Wilson called Keating and asked if California could borrow Daxon to help sort out the Orange County mess. Keating agreed to a 4-month loan of Daxon's services. Daxon returned to Oklahoma full-time in April 1995 to serve as Keating's budget director. In that position, Daxon was responsible for overseeing the developing and implementation of the Keating's annual state budget. Concurrent with his service as State Finance Director, Keating appointed Daxon as Oklahoma Secretary of Finance and Revenue. As Finance Secretary, Daxon was responsible for developing Keating's economic and tax policies as well as providing oversight to the State's finance agencies, including the Oklahoma Tax Commission, the Oklahoma State Banking Department, the Oklahoma Department of Consumer Credit, the Oklahoma Department of Securities, and the Oklahoma Department of Insurance. Daxon remained as Finance Secretary for Keating's entire eight years as governor. Other governmental service=Corporation Commission When Democrat Brad Henry was elected governor, Daxon was appointed interim general administrator for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Daxon served in that position from January to June 2003. Opportunity Oklahoma Daxon resigned from the Corporation Commission to become the Executive Director of Opportunity Oklahoma, an Oklahoma City business organization designed to help state officials create an environment conducive for economic growth. He remained in that position until 2005. Oklahoma House of Representatives In the 2004 Oklahoma general election, Republicans gained a majority in the Oklahoma House of Representatives for the first time since 1921. Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives-elect Todd Hiett (R-Kellyville) appointed Daxon Director of the House Office of Budget and Performance Review. As Director, he provided fiscal analysis to the House speaker and Appropriation and Budget committee chairmen and oversaw all performance reviews of state agency operations.

The common was used for centuries as a place where local people could collect firewood and graze cattle, and by the early nineteenth century it was the site of the Hays Fair, a popular day out for Londoners.The common has also been the venue for the crowning of the London May Queen for 105 years as of 2017. In the 1860s the owner of the land, Sir John Lennard, began to sell off plots in the neighbouring West Wickham Common for housing, and the Hayes commoners feared that their common would suffer the same fate. They organised opposition, and in 1869 Hayes Common was the first common to be protected against enclosure under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866. In 1937 the Municipal Borough of Bromley became the freeholder of the common, and when the Municipal Borough was abolished in 1965 the London Borough of Bromley inherited ownership.

Currently the university offers programs in Adab, Da'wah, Sharia, Tarbiya, Ushuluddin, science and technology and social science and humanities. History The desire to establish Islamic institutions of higher education have been present since the colonial era. Dr. Wirjosandjojo Satiman stressed the importance of establishing an Islamic institute of higher education in order to raise the self-esteem of Muslims in the Dutch East Indies. Such an institution was established on July 8, 1945, when the Islamic High School was built in Jakarta. During the revolution the Islamic High School was moved to Yogyakarta, and reopened on April 10, 1946. In November 1947 a committee was formed to discuss improvements to the High School, and an agreement to establish the Indonesian Islamic University was reached on March 10, 1948. The university had four faculties: religion, law, economics, and education. The government recognized the nationalist groups who had participated in the revolution by constructing the University of Gadjah Mada in 1950. The development of the Islamic University of Indonesia has occurred rapidly, with the Faculty of Indonesia consisting of 22 branches. Based on the Presidential Decree No. 50/2004, IAIN Sunan Kalijaga was transformed into the State Islamic University (UIN) Sunan Kalijaga. This has encouraged UIN Sunan Kalijaga to make development in various areas, including management and academic fields. Links with various organisations both inside the country and abroad are also being developed. Currently, there are 8 school/faculties in the university, which include: # School of Adab dan Ilmu Budaya (Humanities) # School of Ushuluddin, dan Pemikiran Islam (Islamic Philosophy and Theology) # School of Dakwah dan Komunikasi (Islamic Communication and Social Welfare) # School of Syariah dan Hukum (Laws) # School of Ilmu Tarbiyah dan Keguruan (Education) # School of Ilmu Sosial dan Humaniora (Social Sciences) # School of Ekonomi dan Bisnis Islam (Islamic Economics) # School of Sain dan Teknologi (Science and Technology) External links * http://www.uin-suka.ac.id [Sunan Kalijaga University Website] * http://www.integratedlaboratory.com [Sunan Kalijaga University Laboratory Website] * https://web.archive.org/web/20100228225910/http://iciebm.com/ [Industrial Engineering International Seminar in Sunan Kalijaga University] * https://web.archive.org/web/20120118030045/http://www.icbb2011.com/ [International Conference on Bioscience and Biotechnology presented by Biology Department] * https://web.archive.org/web/20130204094151/http://icid2011.com/ [International Conference on Informatics for Development by Informatics Department] * Student Community of Islamic State in Indonesia Category:Universities in Indonesia Category:Universities in the Special Region of Yogyakarta Category:Sleman Regency Category:Islamic universities and colleges in Indonesia Category:Indonesian state universities ","title":"Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University"},{"id":"26587234","text":"Bigger Than America is the sixth studio album by the English synthpop band Heaven 17. It was originally released in September 1996, on the label Eye of the Storm, eight years after their previous album, Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho. The album peaked at number one on Germany Alphabeat Redaktionscharts' Rock/Pop/Alternative Charts in November 1996, but did not chart in the UK. It was listed as number 6 on the online music magazine Addicted to Noise's Writers Poll. In an interview with The Guardian in 2010, Ware recalled: \\"This went under the radar to the extent that hardly anybody in this country knew about it; we did do an album in '95 called Bigger Than America, which was our attempt to re-engage early analogue synths and create an album based on that. It just got lost in the big Warner Brothers machine.\\" Critical reception Upon its release, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented: \\"Heaven 17 have hardly changed [and] things are much the same - just less melodic. Marsh and Ware still produce plinky, one-tempo backbeats, [and] Gregory's lyrics are disillusioned, even morose. \\"We Blame Love\\" has the closest thing to a tune, which brings us to the crux of the matter - their status as godfathers of techno is unchallenged, but these songs are hollow and too samey.\\" Robert Semrow of Keyboard wrote: \\"[Heaven 17] were outstanding before, and have only improved with time. Each song is solid and very dancefloor-friendly. Bigger Than America is similar to their previous sound, with pads and dance grooves providing a backdrop for Gregory's unmistakable strong vocals. Lots of movement, lots of changes, and lots to enjoy.\\" Howard Cohen of Knight Ridder summarised: \\"Erasure-like Europop cuts \\"Freak!\\" and \\"Another Big Idea\\" are danceable enough, and there's a throbbing Giorgio Moroder dance remix. But this is largely tuneless, boring stuff.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and multistakeholder governance. The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur, with a satellite office in Jakarta. RSPO currently has 4,706 members from 94 countries. Criticisms The RSPO has been criticised by various sectors, especially the environmental NGOs. Issues include the impact of palm oil plantations on the orangutan population; destruction of tropical forest for the new oil palm plantations; the burning and draining of large tracts of peat swamp forest in Borneo, Malaysia. The fact that RSPO members are allowed to clear cut pristine forest areas, when there are large areas of grasslands available in Indonesia, raises doubts about commitment to sustainability. In 2013, the 11th annual RSPO meeting was crashed by palm oil workers and others, and Indonesian and international labour-rights groups have documented a litany of abuses, including forced labour and child labour. A 2013 study uncovered \\"flagrant disregard for human rights at some of the very plantations the RSPO certifies as 'sustainable'\\". The RSPO's pace of progress has drawn considerable negative attention. The organization is currently revising its core Principles and Criteria, only now after five years with the current set, to include a clear standard on deforestation of high conservation value forests, and it took until 2017 to develop a clear Smallholder Standard. Scientific analysis In July 2020 scientists show via detailed analysis of satellite images that, as indicated by several prior empirical research studies and investigations, the certified \\"sustainable\\" palm oil production resulted in deforestation of tropical forests of Sumatra and Borneo and endangered mammals' habitat degradation in the past 30 years. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) The WWF released in 2009 a Palm Oil Buyer's Scorecard. The website stated in 2010: > Clearing for oil palm plantations threatens some of the world‚Äôs greatest > forests, endangered species such as orangutans, and puts forest-dwelling > people at risk. But with better management practices, the palm oil industry > could provide benefits without threatening our some of our most breathtaking > natural treasures... > > Reaching those objectives requires a common language for industry, > environmental and social groups to work together. Through the Roundtable on > Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), WWF has helped to establish a platform for > these parties to collaborate towards the production of sustainable palm oil. > Thanks to the RSPO, sustainable palm oil is now on the market. By applying > stringent production criteria to all stages of palm oil manufacture, some > companies are proving that oil palm plantations need not flourish at the > expense of rainforests. But so much more remains to be done. Too many palm > oil producers still ignore the destructive impacts of palm oil plantations, > contributing to biodiversity loss and social unrest and more companies that > buy palm oil need to switch to using certified sustainable palm oil in their > products. In 2018, the WWF updated its position to support the RSPO Updated Principles and Criteria, the outcome of an extensive multi-stakeholder consultation process on achieving sustainable palm oil production, stating that the RSPO \\"represents an essential tool that can help companies achieve their commitments to palm oil that is free of deforestation, expansion on peat, exploitation and the use of fire.\\"https://wwf.panda.org/?337932 WWF continues to monitor the palm oil industry. Other Roundtable initiatives Similar initiatives have been established for other sectors including: Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels, Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, Roundtable on Sustainable Forests, Roundtable on Sustainable Development, Roundtable on Responsible Soy, and Roundtable for a Sustainable Cocoa Economy.

History The majority of the area of Myatt's Fields belonged to the estate of Sir Hughes Minet, who in 1770 bought 118 acres of land from Sir Edward Knatchbull on the border of Lambeth. Minet was a third generation descendant of Isaac Minet, a French Huguenot refugee who fled France following the 1685 Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The names of some of the streets around the park, such as Calais Street and Cormont Road, refer to Minet's French connection. In 1889, Isaac Minet's descendant William Minet gave 14¬Ω acres of land to the London County Council as a public park. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association then spent some ¬£10,000 on the layout of the park, it was opened on 13 April 1889. In 1935, William Minet's daughter, Susan Minet, gave a further quarter of an acre of land near the junction of Knatchbull Road and Calais Street to the park. Minet family philanthropy also resulted in the construction on the adjacent Knatchbull Road the neighbouring St James the Apostle church (now converted to flats), the Minet Library, and Longfield Hall, a community hall. According to British History, 'The name Myatt's Fields commemorates Joseph Myatt, a former tenant who had been famous for the rhubarb which he grew there.' The park was designed by Fanny Wilkinson, Britain's first professional woman landscape gardener,http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury- project/articles/articles/wilkinson.pdf and was first opened to the public in May 1889. It is named after Joseph Myatt, a tenant market gardener, who grew strawberries and rhubarb on the land in the 19th century. The Park's mulberry tree may date from the land's previous use as a market garden. Hyperlapse video around the inside and outside of the park Minet estate in 1841In 2009, a ¬£2.6m renovation of the park was completed with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Lambeth Council, as well as ¬£300,000 raised by the Myatt's Fields Park Project Group. The MFPPG is run by local volunteers and chaired by Lindsay Avebury from 2000 until 2011. Minet estate in 1885 The singer Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine grew up near the park and has said that her earliest memory was of climbing trees in the park. The Park was once described by former Poet Laureate John Betjeman as a \\"strangely beautiful place.\\" Features The Park includes a bandstand, summerhouse, and caf√©. It is also home to tennis courts, a football pitch, basketball court, picnic area, a children's playground and a community greenhouse.

The conventional List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East include around 130 patriarchs. A number of these patriarchs are legendary, or invented, or have been included in the standard lists on dubious evidence. By various historical evidence, patriarchal succession is claimed from this office to the patriarchate of the Church of the Easts successor churches: the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Ancient Church of the East.  Fictionalisation of the early history of the Church of the East  The Church of the East, although separated from the State church of the Roman Empire, was not immune to its fashions. One such fashion was to fill in the inevitable gaps in the historical record to trace a succession of bishops in individual dioceses right back to the 1st century, preferably to an apostolic founder. This fashion found particular favour in the case of the diocese of Seleucia- Ctesiphon. The first bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon for whom incontestable evidence exists was Papa, who was consecrated around 280. During the 6th century ingenious attempts were made to link Papa with Mari, the legendary apostle of Babylonia. The author of the 6th-century Acts of Mari simply ignored the gap of two and a half centuries that separated the two men and declared that Mari had founded the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon shortly before his death and consecrated Papa as his successor. Later writers were more cunning with their inventions. Shahlufa and Ahadabui, two late-3rd- century bishops of Erbil who had played a notable part in the affairs of the church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were converted retrospectively into early patriarchs. Ahadabui was said to have governed the church of Seleucia- Ctesiphon from 204 to 220, and Shahlufa from 220 to 224. For the 2nd century, three patriarchs were frankly invented: Abris (121‚Äì37), Abraham (159‚Äì71) and Yaqob (190). All three men were declared to be relatives of Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus, and given plausible backstories. These five phantom 'patriarchs' were included in all the later histories of the Church of the East, and by the 12th century their existence was an article of faith for the historian Mari bin Sulaiman. They are still included by courtesy in the traditional List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East, even though most scholars agree that they never existed.  Uncertain patriarchal succession, 1318‚Äì1552  The patriarchal succession of the Church of the East between 1318 and 1552 cannot be satisfactorily determined. The conventional lists of its patriarchs given by Fiey and others rest on very dubious evidence, and the few known facts are set out here. The patriarch Yahballaha III died in November 1317, probably on Saturday 12 November.Wallis Budge, The Monks of Kublai Khan, 305‚Äì6; Gismondi, Maris Amri et Slibae de Patriarchis Nestorianorum Commentaria, ii. 97 and 99; and Moule, Christians in China Before the Year 1550, 126‚Äì7 His successor Timothy II, according to the acts of his synod, was consecrated in February 1318. He was still alive in 1328, but probably died two or three years later, to be succeeded after an uncertain interval by Denha II in 1336/7, who himself died in 1381/2.MSS Diyarbakr (Scher) 70, Jerusalem Syr 10 and Mingana Syr 561 (folio 43a) Denha II is known to have been consecrated in Baghdad, thanks to the patronage of the Christian emir Haggi Togai, but may have been normally resident in the Mosul plain village of Karamlish. Three ceremonial contacts between Denha II and the Jacobite church are recorded by the continuator of Bar Hebraeus's Ecclesiastical Chronicle between 1358 and 1364, and on each occasion Denha was living in Karamlish. Denha II is conventionally believed to have been succeeded by the patriarchs Shem øon II, Shem øon III and Eliya IV, but a 15th-century list of patriarchs mentions only a single patriarch named Shemon between Denha II and Eliya IV, and is probably to be preferred.Wallis Budge, The Book of the Bee, 119 Eliya IV was succeeded by Shemon IV at an unknown date in the first half of the 15th century. Eliya's death has conventionally been placed in 1437 but must have been earlier, as a patriarch named Shemon is mentioned in a colophon of 1429/30.MS Paris BN Syr 184 Shem øon IV died on 20 February 1497 and was buried in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd near the Mosul village of Alqosh. He was succeeded by two short-reigned patriarchs: Shemon V, first mentioned in a colophon of 1500/1, who died in September 1502 and was buried in the monastery of Mar Awgin; and Eliya V, elected in 1503, who died in 1504 and was buried in the church of Mart Meskinta in Mosul.MSS Diyarbakr (Scher) 102, Paris BN Syr 25 and Vat Syr 204a Eliya V was succeeded by the patriarch Shemon VI (1504‚Äì38), who died on 5 August 1538 and was buried in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. According to the colophon of a contemporary manuscript, the patriarchal throne was still vacant on 19 October 1538.MS Vat Syr 83 Shemon's brother the metropolitan Ishoyahb Bar Mama, who had been natar kursya throughout his reign, is first mentioned as patriarch in a colophon of 1539.MS Vat Syr 339 Shemon VII Ishoyahb died on 1 November 1558 and was buried, like his predecessor, in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd near Alqosh. His reign saw the schism of 1552 that resulted in the creation of the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1553.  'Shemon VIII Denha' and the schism of 1552  In 1552 a section of the Church of the East, angered by the appointment of minors to important episcopal positions by the patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb, revolted against his authority. The rebels elected in his stead Sulaqa, the superior of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd near Alqosh, but were unable to consecrate him as no bishop of metropolitan rank was available, as canonically required. Franciscan missionaries were already at work among the Nestorians, and they persuaded Sulaqa's supporters to legitimize their position by seeking Sulaqa's consecration by Pope Julius III (1550‚Äì5). Sulaqa went to Rome, where he made a satisfactory Catholic profession of faith and presented a letter, drafted by his supporters in Mosul, which set out his claims to be recognized as patriarch. This letter, which has survived in the Vatican archives, grossly distorted the truth. The rebels claimed that the Nestorian patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb had died in 1551 and had been succeeded illegitimately by 'Shemon VIII Denha' (1551‚Äì8), a non-existent patriarch invented purely for the purpose of bolstering the legitimacy of Sulaqa's election. The Vatican was taken in by this fraud, and recognised Sulaqa as the founding patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in April 1553, thereby creating a permanent schism in the Church of the East. It was only several years later that the Vatican discovered that Shemon VII Ishoyahb was still alive.  Patriarchal succession, 16th to 18th centuries  The patriarchal succession after the schism of 1552 is certain in the case of the Mosul patriarchate, because up to the beginning of the 19th century all but one of its patriarchs were buried in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and their epitaphs, which give the date of their deaths, have survived. Shemon VII's successor Eliya VII died on 26 May 1591, after having been a metropolitan for 15 years and patriarch for 32 years; Eliya VIII on 26 May 1617; Eliya IX on 18 June 1660; Eliya X Yohannan Marogin on 17 May 1700; Eliya XI Marogin on 14 December 1722; and Eliya XIII Ishoyahb in 1804. Eliya XII Denha died of plague in Alqosh on 29 April 1778, and was exceptionally buried in the town rather than the monastery, which had been abandoned and locked up following a Persian attack in 1743. The information available on Sulaqa and his successors is much less exact. The date of Sulaqa's election in 1552 is not known, but he was confirmed as 'patriarch of Mosul' by the Vatican on 28 April 1553, and was martyred at the beginning of 1555, probably (according to a contemporary poem of Abdisho IV) on 12 January. The date of Abdisho IV‚Äôs succession in 1555 is not known, but a colophon mentions that he died on 11 September 1570. The dates of Shemon VIII Yahballaha's succession and death (presumably in 1570 and 1580 respectively) are not known. Shemon IX Denha was elected patriarch in 1580 and (according to Assemani) died in 1600. Shemon X, elected in 1600, is said to have died in 1638, according to a letter of Eliya XIII cited by Tisserant. Information on the patriarchal succession in the Qudshanis patriarchate for the remainder of the seventeenth and the whole of the 18th century is equally scanty. Several of the Qudshanis patriarchs who succeeded Shemon X corresponded with the Vatican, but the surviving correspondence does not enable individual patriarchs to be distinguished. The following list of 17th- and 18th-century Qudshanis patriarchs has conventionally been adopted, most recently by Fiey and (provisionally) by Wilmshurst: Shemon XI (1638‚Äì56), Shemon XII (1656‚Äì62), Shemon XIII Denha (1662‚Äì1700), Shemon XIV Shlemun (1700‚Äì40), Shemon XVI Mikhail Mukhtas (1740‚Äì80), and Shemon XVI Yohannan (1780‚Äì1820). These names and reign-dates were first given towards the end of the 19th century by the Anglican missionary William Ainger Wigram. A recently discovered list of Qudshanis patriarchs compiled after the First World War by the bishop Eliya of Alqosh, however, gives a completely different set of dates: Shemon X (1600‚Äì39); Shemon XI (1639‚Äì53); Shemon XII (1653‚Äì92); Shemon XIII Denha (1692‚Äì1700); and Shemon XIV Shlemun (1700‚Äì17). It is not yet clear whether either list is based on a reliable source, and the patriarchal succession must for the time being remain uncertain. In 1681 a Catholic line of patriarchs who took the name Joseph was founded at Amid (Diyarbakr). The reign dates of these patriarchs are not in doubt: Joseph I (1681‚Äì95); Joseph II (1696‚Äì1712); Joseph III (1713‚Äì57); Joseph IV (patriarch, 1757‚Äì80; patriarchal administrator, 1781‚Äì96); and Joseph V (1804‚Äì28). Strictly speaking, Augustine Hindi, who styled himself Joseph V, was merely the patriarchal administrator of the Amid and Mosul patriarchates, but he liked to think of himself as a patriarch and the Vatican found it politic to indulge him in this fantasy.  Patriarchal succession, 19th and 20th centuries  There were three Qudshanis patriarchs in the decades leading up to the First World War: Shemon XVII Abraham (1820‚Äì61), Shemon XVIII Rubil (1861‚Äì1903), and Shemon XIX Benjamin (1903‚Äì18), who was consecrated at an uncanonically early age. Shemon XIX Benjamin (1903‚Äì18) was murdered in the village of Kohnashahr in the Salmas district in 1918, and was succeeded by the feeble Shemon XX Paul (1918‚Äì20). Paul died only two years after taking office. As there were no other qualified members of the patriarchal family available, he was succeeded by his twelve-year-old nephew Eshai, who was consecrated patriarch on 20 June 1920 under the name Shemon XXI Eshai. Shemon XXI Eshai (who arbitrarily added the apostle Simon Peter, Shemon Shliha, to the head of the list of patriarchs of the Church of the East and thereafter styled himself Shemon XXIII Eshai) was murdered in the United States in 1975 and succeeded in 1976 by Dinkha IV Hnanya, the first non- Catholic patriarch of the Church of the East to be appointed canonically (i.e., not by hereditary succession) since the 15th century.

In luminescence, only a small fraction of atoms, called emission centers or luminescence centers, emit light. In inorganic phosphors, these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of dopants, impurities called activators. (In rare cases dislocations or other crystal defects can play the role of the impurity.) The wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself, its electronic configuration, and on the surrounding crystal structure. The activators prolong the emission time (afterglow). In turn, other materials (such as nickel) can be used to quench the afterglow and shorten the decay part of the phosphor emission characteristics. The electronic configuration of the activator depends on its oxidation state and is crucial for the light emission. Oxidation of the activator is one of the common mechanisms of phosphor degradation. The distribution of the activator in the crystal is also of high importance. Diffusion of the ions can cause depletion of the crystal from the activators with resulting loss of efficiency. This is another mechanism of phosphor degradation. The scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the electronic band structure found in the crystals. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap). This leaves an associated hole behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the forbidden gap. The excitons are loosely bound electron-hole pairs which wander through the crystal lattice until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). In case of inorganic scintillators, the activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or near-UV where photomultipliers are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain metastable states not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states, slowed by reliance on the low-probability forbidden mechanism, again results in light emission (slow component). The activator is the main factor determining the phosphor emission wavelength. The nature of the host crystal can however to some degree influence the wavelength as well. More activators can be used simultaneously. Common examples of activators are: * Copper, added in concentration of 5 ppm to copper-activated zinc sulfide, used in glow in the dark materials and green CRT phosphors; long afterglow * Silver, added to zinc sulfide to produce a phosphor/scintillator used in radium dials, spinthariscopes, and as a common blue phosphor in color CRTs, and to zinc sulfide-cadmium sulfide used as a phosphor in black-and-white CRTs (where the ZnS/(Zn,Cd)S ratio determines the blue/yellow balance of the resulting white); short afterglow * Europium(II), added to strontium aluminate, used in high-performance glow in the dark materials, very long afterglow; with other host materials it is frequently used as the red emitter in color CRTs and fluorescent lights. * Cerium, added to yttrium aluminium garnet used in white light emitting diodes, excited by blue light and emitting yellow * Thallium, used in sodium iodide and caesium iodide scintillator crystals for detection of gamma radiation and for gamma spectroscopy A newly discovered activator is Samarium(II), added to calcium fluoride. Sm(II) is one of the few materials reported which offers efficient scintillation in the red region of the spectrum, particularly when cooled by dry ice.

The cars were made from 1976 to 2010 by Metrovagonmash and the I. E. Yegorov Vagonmash factories of Mytishchi and Saint Petersburg, respectively. Production is still ongoing for specific models and/or modernizations. The name 81-717 and 81-714 come from the Soviet electric rail vehicle numbering system, where the 81-717 cars are the control cars and the 81-714 are the trailer cars. Unlike the previous metro sets made in the Soviet Union, they never received a lettered classification, thus, they have been known as the 81-series or the \\"Number Trains\\" (–ù–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –ü–æ–µ–∑–¥). The \\"number trains\\", as they are known colloquially among railfans and some commuters, feature restyled front ends, stronger electric traction motors, complex and wider usage of various electronic devices, and are more advanced than their predecessors, the E-series, with the biggest difference being lack of control desks at every end of each car (despite all cars being motorized, though). They were first deployed in Moscow and Prague in 1978, and have since then seen widespread usage in the former USSR and in Warsaw, Prague, Budapest and Sofia in European Union. History=Background By the 1970s, most metro lines in the Soviet Union were using the E-series trainsets, which started mass production in 1963 (although the prototype was built in 1959). They were a further development of the G and D-series sets from the late 1940s and 1950s, but with upgraded electric equipment (contactor-based, built by the Dinamo Electric Machines Factory of Moscow). Although there was improvement in the construction of the carbodies (based on the Riga-built ER1 EMUs of the Soviet Railways), the traction motors were quite weak, and the contactor system had limits. This, in relation to the weight of the cars and the oversimplified electric system, which was built in order to emphasize on energy conservation, led to a poor acceleration performance, which reduced the headway on metro lines on various networks at the time. To counter this, engineers came up with 3 different solutions: *Increase the power of the traction motors *Apply pulse voltage regulation, with excitation of traction motors *Reduce the weight of the carbodies The pulse voltage regulation system was already attempted. The Eƒçs subseries of the E-series, which was delivered to Prague from 1972 to 1976, was much different from the Ev subseries delivered to Budapest from 1969 to 1979: it featured thyristor pulse converters to regulate the excitation of traction motors during acceleration and deceleration, increasing their performance, whilst retaining the same carbody. Another upgrade was the E≈æ3/Em508T subseries, delivered to multiple Soviet cities from 1973 to 1979. Using experiences learnt from the Ei subseries (delivered from 1968 to 1973), it applied pulse voltage regulation on traction motors too, and eliminated the ripple-effects within the ALS-ARS safety systems, greatly improving the general performance of these sets and at the same time, keeping electric consumption to the strictly necessary. In regards to weight reduction, it was still decided to reduce some weight, so the carbodies would be built from aluminium. A more powerful traction engine was developed, too. Vykhino, 2009. Gaining knowledge from experimenting with the E-series lead to the eventual development of the I-series, and later to the 81-series Thus, in 1973, at the Mytishchi Machine-Building Plant, a team of engineers under the leadership of the plant's chief designer A. G. Akimov, designed three different prototypes of the new trains, which later became known as the I-series (in the numbered classification, 81-715 was the control car, and 81-716 was the trailer car). The first prototype of the I-series was manufactured in 1974, and it was a drastic change from the other Moscow Metro sets that were using the network at the time: compared to the original E-series, which produced 72 kWh, the new sets produced 90 (later 100) kWh. The aluminium alloy carbodies reduced the tare mass of the cars by 2 tonnes, and featured thyristorized voltage regulation and excitation, which greatly increased the speed and acceleration of the trains. In addition to this, the new train implemented forced ventilation (removing the humps of the roof that were for ventilation of the passenger area), new lightning in the passenger area, and removal of cabs on the trailer cars, leaving only 1 cab at the each end of the train. This greatly increased the passenger capacity and performance. But despite its advantages, it posed disadvantages to its manufacturers: it was too complex to be mass-produced, in such a short time. The factories that were to produce the cars could not set up aluminium manufacturing facilities in such a short time, and additionally, the voltage regulation system and thyristors required refinement. The type 1 prototype of the I-series was eventually made, but the production of the E≈æ3/Em508T subseries continued, also due to lower costs of manufacture. The base model By the early 1970s, the Metrovagonmash factory already designed a trailer car type, based on the never-built E≈æ2 subseries. The control cars were also based on the E≈æ2, but the front end was modified, along with the drivers controls. These two types of cars later became 81-714 and 81-717, respectively. With more lessons learnt from the electrical propulsion system of the I-series, in the first half of 1976, the Mytishchi factories made the first cars of the 81-series. These were 5846, 5854, 5855 (control cars) and 5837, 5867, 5868 (trailer cars). The design of the new cars was similar, but at the same time, different from the newest E-series cars. The carbodies were roughly similar to them, having same dimensions. Certain equipment (doors, motor-compressors, batteries, other pneumatic equipment) were also carried over from the E≈æ3 subseries. However the most noticeable external change was in the front ends of the train: the driver car was moved in the middle of the train, no longer being placed on the right side of the train. Additionally, the emergency exit doors were removed, because of this. Traction motors from the I-series, the DK-117B, now producing 110 kWh, were installed. Compared to the older trains an Auxiliary Power Supply Unit (–ë–ª–æ–∫ –ü–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –°–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ù—É–∂–¥) was installed to power the batteries. Lightning in the passenger area was now made with fluorescent lamps. This led to an increase in the tare weight of the cars, so it was decided to use a springs-based suspension. The 81-series cars never got a lettered classification, because these were an experimental alternative to the complex I-series cars. But the complexity of the I-series cars, which meant endless adjustments regarding aluminium production, pulse regulation, at the time when newly opened Soviet metro networks (such as in Tashkent, Kharkov, etc.) were in dire need of new cars, led to the selection of the 81-series to become the new standard metro trainset of the Soviet Union. The production of prototypes of the I-series continued in the 1980s, but they were the last to receive a lettered classification, which meant that metro sets produced from the 81-717/714 onwards never received a lettered classification. With the appearance of newer sets (such as the Yauza, Rusich, Oka, Neva, Moskva), the 81-series then became known as the \\"Numbered Train\\" (–ù–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –ü–æ–µ–∑–¥; Nomernoy Poezd). It should also be noted that \\"nomernoy\\" also stands for vehicle registration plates, so this can be a widely interpreted name in the English language. The demand for the cars was very high at the beginning, so high, that production at the I. E. Yegorov factory in Leningrad (now known as Vagonmash Saint Petersburg) began in January 1980, later on, the Tver (then known as Kalinin) Railcar Factory began production of these cars in mid-1980 of 81-717 cars, and in 1985 of 81-714 cars. Operation Since its start of production, the sets began to be delivered to all metro networks in the Soviet Union, but it was also available to the Warsaw Pact countries. Within the USSR In the former USSR, all trains use the Russian broad gauge of 1520 mm. =Moscow= Moscow was the first customer of the 81-717/714 train in the Soviet Union, where it initially tested the prototypes between 1976 and 1977. By late 1977 it had placed its order for the new train, and the first trains arrived in 1978 on the Koltsevaya line, replacing the G-series metro trains that had operating since the opening of the line in 1950. This was followed with the newly opened Kalininskaya line and the Zamoskvoretskaya line in 1979. Since then they have become representative of the network, being used on almost all lines (except the ones that kept using E-series trainsets and that were replaced with Rusich, Oka and Moskva trainsets). Beginning with 1993, the Moscow Metro began purchasing 81-717.5M/714.5M sets, after in 1988 the production of the base model ended, leaving a 5-year break in purchases of new cars (during this time, the ill-fated Yauza trains were in planning stage). Deliveries further continued between 1997 and 2010. Over the years, the 81-717/714 sets received improvements, especially from the late 1990s onwards, replacing the traditional leather bench-type seats with vandal-proof plastic seats. Externally, the difference between the base model and newer sets is the presence of 4 headlights in the centre instead of 2 headlights above the drivers' cab. Kommunarka, 29 June 2019. The 81-717.5M/714-5M's main visual difference from the original sets is the different front headlight configuration. This particular set was involved in the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings Some of the 81-717/714 sets have special liveries, most notably the \\"Red Arrow\\" train, which is painted in a red-golden livery instead of the traditional blue-white livery. More recently, refurbished sets feature the new Moscow Metro livery, with blue corrugated sides and grey window bands. Another special example is the 81-717.A/714.A set, used exclusively on the Sokolnicheskaya line. It was based on the A-series sets of the Moscow metro, following an old-school theme - the exterior is similar to the A-series sets in a cream-chocolate livery, whilst the interior is based on 1950s carriages. Their current allocation is as it follows: *TMD-1 Severnoye (Sokolnicheskaya line) *TMD-2 Sokol (Zamoskvoretskaya line) *TMD-5 Kaluzhskoye (Kaluzho- Rizhskaya line) *TMD-7 Zamoskvoretskoye (Zamoskvoretskaya line) *TMD-10 Sviblovo (Kaluzho-Rizhskaya line) *TMD-13 Cherkizovo (Sokolnicheskaya line) *TMD-15 Pechatniki (Lyublinsko-Dimitrovskaya line) *TMD-19 Likhobory (Lyublinsko-Dimitrovskaya line) It is expected that at some point, the trains will be withdrawn due to the incoming \\"Moskva\\" trainsets, which have been introduced gradually since 2017 on multiple lines where the 81-717/714s are operating. =Saint Petersburg= In service on the second line, fourth line and the fifth line since the 1980s. =Nizhny Novogorod (Gorky)=Samara (Kuybyshev)=Yekaterinburg=Kyiv=Dnipro=Kharkov=Minsk=Baku=Yerevan=Tbilisi=Tashkent= The trains were delivered to Tashkent from 1980 to 1993 in order to replace the Ezh3/Em-508T cars on Chilonzor line and enter service on the Uzbekiston line. There are 168 carriages operational today on the metro. Outside the USSR Outside the USSR, the trainsets were delivered initially to Prague and Budapest, and later on to Warsaw and Sofia. As such, they have 1435mm axles. =Prague= 507 vehicles of type 81-717.1/714.1 (204 motor cars and 303 trailers) were delivered to Prague between 1978 and 1990,https://metroweb.cz/metro/81-71/81-71.htm the aim being to run 101 5-car sets with two motors kept as spares. Three cars were lost: one was scrapped after a derailment at Leninova (Dejvick√°) station in 1986, while two were lost in a fire at Kosmonaut≈Ø (H√°je) station in 1987. Full overhauls had been scheduled for the oldest cars in the early 1990s, but it was eventually decided that a more complete rebuild was required, and between 1994 and 2010 most but not all of the 81-71 cars were rebuilt as 81-71M stock by ≈†koda and ƒåKD. =Budapest= Cars of type 81-717.2/714.2 were delivered to Hungary between 1979 and 1990, where they have been in service on lines M2 and M3. In 2015 a contract was signed on the modernization of the existing older subway cars on the metro. In 2016 the first subway train left Budapest and was delivered back to Metrovagonmash in Russia to be overhauled into type 81-717.2K/714.2K. The first train entered service in March 2017, The Original powering DC motors has been replaced into a Japan made Toyo Denki‚Äôs (Denki as a Japanese of Electric)VVVF motors and replaced the whole driving systems. also all the rest of the trains were delivered by August 2018. The metros on metro line 2 were replaced by modern Alstom Metropolis vehicles. =Warsaw= Subway cars of type 81-717.3/714.3 were delivered to Poland between 1989 and 1995. The train sets are formed of six cars. By 1994, the metro has received metro cars of type 81-572/573. Additional Russian built cars of type 81-572.2/573.2 were also delivered between 2007 and 2009. =Sofia= Metro cars of type 81-717.4/714.4 were delivered to Bulgaria in 1990 some 8 years prior to the opening of the capital's metro. The trains are all formed of four carriages, but in 2005 and 2013 the Bulgarian metro system has been receiving trains of type 81-740.2/741.2 or 81-740.2B/741.2B, and currently there are only 12 four carriage train sets of type 81-717.4/714.4 and 40 three car train sets of type 81-740.2/741.2. A contract was signed in 2018 in modernization of the existing 81-717.4/714.4 cars, the first refurbished trains were delivered in 2020. The refurbished trains look very similar to type 81-717.2k/714.2k of Budapest metro line M3. Technicalities The 81-717/714 cars in the former Soviet Union operate on metro networks with 1520+4 mm track gauges. The Sofia, Budapest, Warsaw and Prague metro networks use standard gauge (1435 mm) and receive power from the 3rd rail via a bottom- contact shoe, except in Budapest, which uses top-contact shoes. The trains usually have a flexible formation, of 2 control cars at each end, and a variable number of trailer cars in the middle. Thus, a train can have only 1 car in the middle, or up to 6, making 3 to 8 car formations. However, a notable exception is on the Yerevan metro, where trains there can operate even with no trailer cars. In addition to this, the 81-717M type has 2 cabs at both ends, as opposed to 1 cab at opposing ends, also used in Yerevan. Mechanical partCarbodies=AxlesElectrical partInterior fittings Interior of an early 81-717/714 car in Moscow, undergoing disinfection due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. The interior is similar to the E-series cars Interior of a later 81-717/714 in Moscow, with vandal-proof seating instead of leather benches. Like all metro trains of the former Soviet Union, the 81-717/714 trains feature longitudinal bench seating, which is placed to the walls of the cars between the doors and an empty central aisle. The passenger area is ventilated with the help of air vents on the roof of the car, along with small sliding windows. Originally, bench seats with hard leather trim were fitted on these cars, but they were subject to vandalism in the 1990s and 2000s. Due to this, refurbished and later models feature vandal-proof seating with a plastic base and leatherette linings, separate for each passenger. Sometimes, metal partitions can be added too. Overall, the bench seats can accommodate as many as 6 people (or 3 at the end sections), which means that seating space in all cars varies from 40 to 48, while seated. While there are access doors between each car, passing from one car to the other while the train is moving is very dangerous, and due to this only staff permits such tasks usually. The doors can be used in an emergency, but they are sometimes used by zatsepers (Russian trainsurfers) to climb on the roof of the train on over-ground sections.  Replacement  As the wear and aging of these trains began to be replaced with newer ones, but in different subways this happened differently , in the Moscow metro as a replacement first were the trains Rusich, later Oka and Moscow . In Saint Petersburg, 81-556 Neva trains are used as replacements, while in Novosibirsk, several of these trains are replaced with 81-540 trains, which are a further development of the 81-717 . In Minsk, the 81-717 train started to run on new Stadler cars manufactured in the Fanipol suburb of Minsk. In Baku, as well as in Moscow, 81-765 trains will be used to replace the 81-740 cars, but these trains will be called Baku.

Hutridurga is situated about 65 km west of Bengaluru in the state of Karnataka, in Kunigal taluk, Tumakuru district. It is situated off the Kunigal-Magadi state highway (SH94), at a distance of about 7 km from it and 10 km from the Anchepalya industrial area on the Bengaluru-Mangalore National Highway (India) - NH48 near Kunigal. Hutridurga was built by Kempegowda in the 16th century. Ruined fortifications are still visible on the two hillocks surrounding the village. Historically, Huthridurga Fort was the military bastion of Tipu Sultan against British, which was conquered by the latter in 1791. It is believed to have been a seven tiered fort and is considered one among the nine \\"Durgas\\" (fortified hills) around Bengaluru (\\"Nava Durgas\\"). It has a small temple dedicated to Shiva known as the Shankareshwara temple, a Nandi idol on the top of the hill and an Anjaneya temple, midway. Aadi Narayanaswamy and Veerabhadra temples are situated in the village. The Pooja to the deity is done only on Mondays and Fridays. It saw use as a center of administration during summer and there are structures that housed the war commander, soldiers and a stone umbrella that is said to have been used by Kempegowda himself. The hill fort has eight gateways from the foot to the summit in addition to several outer gates. On the summit known as Sankarakumbhi is situated a small Shankareshwara temple with a spring called Dodda done or big spring in front of it. From the summit, we get an extensive view of the surrounding landscape dotted by a large number of tanks and hills. Hutridurga derives its name from Hutri, a village situated about 3 km from the foot of the hill. The village immediately at the foot of the hill is known as Santhepet and that situated on the first elevation as Hutridurga. The Hutridurga village has several temples of Adinarayana, Veerabhadra and Anjaneya etc. Near Hutridurga is the village of Sondalagere, home to the Kambada Narasimha Swamy (Pillar Narasimha Swamy) temple. The village is situated on Kunigal - Magadi road via Kempanahalli at a distance of 12 km from Kunigal town and connected by bus service. The village has views of Hutidurga hill. It is a day hike for enthusiasts showcasing the nature at its best and is located close to the state capital of Karnataka, Bengaluru. Wildlife includes a diversity of insects, birds and mammals, including bear, leopard and wild boar. As available infrastructure is basic, there have been discussions about initiating work to build a museum to showcase Kempegowda particularly as it is the only place that has monuments connected personally to the founder of Bengaluru. There have also been demands to improve public transport services to this hobli cum village.. the whole hike is 5 km in distance and can be completed by beginners.

RapNet.com. Retrieved 21 October 2011. Mostovicz was among the pioneers who found the way to polish the now popular Hearts-and-Arrow cut as early as 1985 turning his factory into one of the very best in the industry. Training his polishers to express their personality through diamond polishing in a true artisan way earned Mostovicz the confidence of Mr. Taruhito Tamura of Good Company who entrusted Mostovicz as the only person outside Tamura's organization to manufacture and to distribute Tamura's EightStar diamond and its derivatives, the Theta and Lambda diamonds. The polishing skills of S. Muller & Sons and the marketing knowledge of Mostovicz were the main reasons for selecting S. Muller & Sons as the only 10 customers of the DTC (De Beers) to distribute the De Beers Millennium diamond limited edition. Working under the supervision of Prof. Leslie de Chernatony, a brand expert, allowed S. Muller & Sons to turn this opportunity into a success where others failed. The interest of Mostovicz in the interaction between the diamond consumer and the retailer is unusual in the diamond industry, where the focus is generally on rough diamond market. The understanding of the critical stage of the retail marketing led Mostovicz to conclude as early as 1994 that the diamond industry was crumbling. Upon viewing the grim future and since he could not find sufficient answers within the diamond industry Mostovicz turned to higher education, completing his MBA and PhD. He is currently a visiting fellow of the Northampton Business School (NBS) of the University of Northampton . Mostovicz claims to be the one who warned the industry that it faces destruction as early as the late 1990s. Mostovicz is now marketing his diamonds in the US in a way based on his research and inspired by Mr. Tamura's approach.

In due course Oncken founded the first Baptist church on German soil, which would become the centre of the Baptist movement in Germany and Europe. Despite the Society's stated aim of supporting existing churches on the Continent and avoiding controversy over secondary issues, it is widely held that its decline was due to controversy over premillennial views and the promotion of separatist views of church polity at the expense of gospel preaching. The fortunes of the Society peaked in the mid-1820s, but from 1830 onward declined. Maybe as early as 1836 the Society's name was changed to European Missionary Society. By 1840 the society was insolvent and forced to submit to a merger with the Anglican Central Committee to form the Foreign Aid Society, whose work continued until just before the First World War.

A businessman, he controlled the Christchurch Press for many decades. He was instrumental in introducing cricket to Canterbury and one of his dealings as a land and estate agent resulted in the creation of Lancaster Park. Early life Englefield Lodge was significantly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake The Whitcombe memorial near the Taramakau River Stevens was born at Salford in the county of Oxfordshire, England. He was the youngest son of Reverend William Everest Stevens (the local rector), and his wife, Mary James. He was educated at Marlborough College and at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester. At age 21, Stevens emigrated to New Zealand. Among the passengers were the surveyor John Henry Whitcombe (known by his middle name Henry) with his wife, Maria Whitcombe (n√©e North), and their family. Several sources say that they arrived in Lyttelton on 20 September 1858 on the Zealandia. However, the Whitcombes and Stevens are not included in the passenger list of the September 1858 arrival. Guise Brittan established notable properties. In 1862, Stevens bought Brittan's second home 'Englefield', a tract on Rural Section 26 situated where FitzGerald Avenue meets the Avon River. The house, which still stands, had a commanding view of the annual opening of the boating regattas. Henry Whitcombe, after whom Whitcombe Pass is named, drowned in 1863 in the Taramakau River on one of his many West Coast exploration trips. Stevens was put in charge of the fund which allowed the Whitcombe boys to attend Christ's College. On 20 May 1869, at St. Peter's Anglican Church in Upper Riccarton, Stevens married Maria Whitcombe. They had two sons, one of whom died in infancy. One of Maria's sons was Frederic Whitcombe. Professional life After having lived on Banks Peninsula for some two years, Stevens returned to Christchurch. In 1861, he set himself up as a land agent, and represented absentee landholders. In April 1862, he joined forces with Richard J. S. Harman to set up Harman and Stevens, acting as land agents and financiers. Harman put Stevens in contact with James FitzGerald, the editor of The Press. FitzGerald was gifted as an editor, but lacked financial skills. Stevens financed FitzGerald beginning in 1863, and took control from 1868 for the rest of his life. FitzGerald once described Stevens as a \\"thorough Jew\\". Cricket After Brittan, Stevens is considered the second-ranked father of cricket in Canterbury. Together with J. A. Bennett, Stevens arranged and financed the All-England Eleven visits in 1863 and 1867. He played in all of Canterbury's representative games until 1883. Stevens was a member of the New Zealand Cricket Council from its inception, and was a president of the Canterbury Cricket Association. In 1882, Stevens and Arthur Ollivier initiated the purchase of a parcel of land which became Lancaster Park. For Stevens, this was a transaction through his company on behalf of an absentee owner, Benjamin Lancaster. Political career Stevens stood for and was elected to the Canterbury Provincial Council in 1863. He served in Tancred's provincial executive until 1866 during Samuel Bealey's superintendency. He left provincial politics on the election of William Sefton Moorhouse as superintendent in that year. Instead, he stood in the newly created Selwyn electorate for a seat in the House of Representatives in early 1866. As there were no other candidates, he was returned uncontested to the 4th New Zealand Parliament. His ability, especially in financial matters, was soon recognised. Stevens contested Selwyn at the following 1871 general election, advocating free trade and opposing a grain duty. He lost by one vote to William Reeves who took the seat 102 votes to 101. At the 21 December 1875 election, he stood in the City of Christchurch electorate for the 6th New Zealand Parliament. He was returned at the head of the poll in this three-member electorate; the other members returned for this seat were Edward Richardson and Moorhouse. Stevens again stood for the City of Christchurch seat in the 10 September 1879 election. He came second-equal and was thus returned, together with George Grey and Samuel Paull Andrews, to the 7th New Zealand Parliament. At the end of the 7th session of the House of Representatives, he was offered a seat in the Legislative Council, being appointed on 7 March 1882, and remained on it until he died. He served in the upper house until his death. Stevens was a minister without portfolio in Harry Atkinson's fourth term as premier, called the Scarecrow Ministry. The ministers were sworn in on 11 October 1887 and Stevens remained a minister until the end of Atkinson's term on 24 January 1891. In the 4th Parliament, Stevens campaigned for the abolition of provincial governments, and for provincial loans to be consolidated with those of the colony. He also argued for revived colonisation. The decisions were deferred to the 5th Parliament, and while Stevens was not a member during that term, William Fox and Julius Vogel advanced many of his causes. In 1870, Vogel put forward the Public Trust Bill and acknowledged Stevens as the author of this initiative. Under this bill, the state becomes responsible for the distribution of estates and properties under will. A plaque acknowledging his work is on display in the Public Trust head office. Throughout his parliamentary membership, Stevens advocated for free trade. In 1893 Stevens was at the centre of a drama that led to the passing of the Women's suffrage bill into law. Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Thomas Kelly, a new Liberal Party councillor had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors, Stevens and William Hunter Reynolds that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women.Women's Suffrage in New Zealand by Patricia Grimshaw, p 92. (1972, Auckland University Press) Upon Stevens' death, he was succeeded in the Legislative Council by John Andrew Millar. Death and commemoration Stevens died in his sleep on 6 June 1915 at his home Englefield from heart failure. He is buried at the St. Peter's Anglican Church cemetery. His business acumen may be gauged by the ¬£280,000 that he left, which was distributed to his wife, his son Charles, and members of the Whitcombe family. Sir Charles Bowen, Speaker of the Legislative Council, said about Stevens: > Although he never took the prominent part in the politics of the country > that his undoubted talents warranted, he was a man whose opinion was always > valued, and to whose statements the House always listened with attention. > Mr. Stevens was too busy to give his whole time to politics, but his > carefully considered opinion was sought very frequently. George Whitcombe, Maria's son from her first marriage, died in 1919. Maria Stevens died on 25 October 1921 aged 89. Both are buried at the Avonside Cemetery. Stevens Street, running alongside Lancaster Park, is named for Edward Stevens in recognition of his contributions to cricket. Cephas Close in Sockburn was glebe land belonging to St. Peter's Anglican Church, which was developed in 1985.

The name means dark bearer, in contrast to phosphor, which means light bearer. Scotophors show tenebrescence (reversible photochromism) and darken when subjected to an intense radiation such as sunlight. Minerals showing such behavior include hackmanite sodalite, spodumene and tugtupite. Some pure alkali halides also show such behavior. Scotophors can be sensitive to light, particle radiation (e.g. electron beam ‚Äì see cathodochromism), X-rays, or other stimuli. The induced absorption bands in the material, caused by F-centers created by electron bombardment, can be returned to their non-absorbing state, usually by light and/or heating. Scotophors sensitive to electron beam radiation can be used instead of phosphors in cathode ray tubes, for creating a light absorbing instead of light emitting image. Such displays are viewable in bright light and the image is persistent, until erased. The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity infrared light or by electro- thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and raster formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. In Germany, scotophor tubes were developed by Telefunken as blauschrift-r√∂hre (\\"dark-trace tube\\"). The heating mechanism was a layer of mica with transparent thin film of tungsten. When the image was to be erased, current was applied to the tungsten layer; even very dark images could be erased in 5‚Äì10 seconds. Scotophors typically require a higher- intensity electron beam to change color than phosphors need to emit light. Screens with layers of a scotophor and a phosphor are therefore possible, where the phosphor, flooded with a dedicated wide-beam low-intensity electron gun, produces backlight for the scotophor, and optionally highlights selected areas of the screen if bombarded with electrons with higher energy but still insufficient to penetrate the phosphor and change the scotophor state. The main application of scotophors was in plan position indicators, specialized military radar displays. The achievable brightness allowed projecting the image to a larger surface. The ability to quickly record a persistent trace found its use in some oscilloscopes. Materials Potassium chloride is used as a scotophor with designation P10 in dark-trace CRTs (also called dark trace tubes, color center tubes, cathodochromic displays or scotophor tubes), e.g. in the Skiatron. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting phosphor layer on the face of the tube screen with a scotophor such as potassium chloride (KCl). Potassium chloride has the property that when a crystal is struck by an electron beam, that spot would change from translucent white to a dark magenta color. By backlighting such a CRT with a white or green circular fluorescent lamp, the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics. The F-centers, however, have tendency to aggregate, and the screen needs to be heated to fully erase the image. The image on KCl can be formed by depositing a charge of over 0.3 microcoulomb per square centimeter, by an electron beam with energy typically at 8‚Äì10 keV. The erasure can be achieved in less than a second by heating the scotophor at 150 ¬∞C.Hamann Cathode ray tube with phosphor and scatophor layers in screen (1968) KCl was the most common scotophor used. Other halides show the same property; potassium bromide absorbs in bluish end of the spectrum, resulting in a brown trace, sodium chloride produces a trace that is colored more towards orange.The skiatron or dark trace tube and its applications Another scotophor used in dark-trace CRTs is a modified sodalite, fired in reducing atmosphere or having some chlorides substituted with sulfate ions. Its advantage against KCl is its higher writing speed, less fatigue, and the F-centers do not aggregate, therefore it is possible to substantially erase the screen with light only, without heating.Takeshi Takeda et al.

She looks pretty in the saree and both fall in love with each other. Actually, Rahul was secretly in love with Pinky but knowing about this relationship, he keeps his love a secret. Meanwhile, Rajalakshmi fixes Pooja's marriage with Sanjay. But when she knows about Sanjay's relationship with Pinki, she thinks about Pinky's own mother. Rajalakshmi's husband had an affair with another women. Pinki was their daughter. Later both commit suicide when Rajalakshmi comes to know about the relationship. Pinki is brought up by Rajalakshmi and thinks that Pinki, like her mother is destroying her daughter's life. When Pinki knows the truth she breaks up her relation with Sanjay. Sanjay gets confused by Pinki's unusual behavior, but reluctantly accepts. On the day before the marriage, the enemy tries to attack Rajalakshmi. Pinki saves her and kills the enemy in the ensuing tussle -- a crime for which she is currently serving jail time. In the present, Pinki is being released. Her whole family goes to meet her. She finds that Sanjay to still be a bachelor. The film ends on a happy note.  Cast  * Dileep ... Lt. Commander Sanjaynath * Roma ... Pinki * Bhama ...

Its name is said to have derived its name from the Baweanese (Boyanese) people who lived there during colonial times, when the race course Lumba Kuda was still in Taiping. When the race course moved to Ipoh, most of the Boyanese moved there too. Unlike other Indonesian ethnic groups, such as those from Acheh, Kampar or Java, the Boyanese are more mobile. Therefore, it is very hard to find a Boyanese local at Kampung Boyan anymore. The early Mussolla \\"Surau Kampung Boyan\\" was located near the railway station. Nevertheless, a bigger mosque is now located at Aulong, which was once part of Kampung Boyan. Though it started out as a tin mine in the 1980s, it drew a lot of attention after the rapid development of the Taman and Kamunting mating of the 1980s and 1990s. This attention has left the Kampung Boyan as a mere lane starting from the railway gate, up to Taman Long Jaafar.

He has been involved in numerous bands, either as a full-time or session member. The first band he ever recorded with was the heavy metal/grunge group Jack in the Box, where he had the role of lead singer. He recorded one EP and one full length album with them, before he left the band in 1995. (Jack in the Box came together again in 2010, after 15 years of silence.) After a while he became a part of the band DawG, which never released anything. Then he became the session-bassist for the black metal band Tulus. He participated on the album \\"Evil 1999\\", and the collection \\"Cold Core Collection\\". When Tulus evolved into Khold, he became a full-time member of the band. He played on their debut album, \\"Masterpiss of Pain\\" before he left the band for personal reasons. During this time, he was also vocalist in the metal band Sensa Anima which included several members from Khold and Tulus. They won the Norwegian grammy \\"Spellemannsprisen\\" in 2001. The band only recorded one album, \\"SinThatic\\". He formed his own black metal project named Eikind. In 2004, they released the EP \\"Vargtime\\" on Selbstmord Services. A full-length album called \\"Fucking Ratfest\\" was scheduled for release in 2006 on the same company. This, however, did not happen. Through the band's website, Eikind proclaimed that in his eyes the contract with Selbstmord Services was not valid. He also accused it for not being a serious record company. The future of the band, or if the album ever will be released, is unknown. He joined the prog metal band Winds as bassist/vocalist. The band included several prominent musicians, including Jan Axel von Blomberg of Mayhem. In this band, he really got to show his talent as a singer. He joined also the other members in the band Age of Silence, where Lars Are Nedland handled the lead vocals. Eikind played bass and did some backing vocal parts.

The road that the bridge carries over the creek also marks the boundary between the northern and southern halves of the park, with the southern half still unfinished as of 2010. Barry Curtis Park is a new park named after Barry Curtis in Flat Bush, Manukau City of which the first stage was opened in April 2009. At 94 hectares, it is one of New Zealand's largest parks, of a size as has not been established since the Auckland Domain in the 1840s. The park is currently (2010) only half-completed, with an investment of $17 million (as of 2009) having gone in the sections that are already open or are still being formed and landscaped. Completion is expected around 2022, while the new suburb grows around it. The park was created from a part of a large parcel of dairy farming land the Manukau City Council bought from the Anglican Church Trust Board, at $2.9 million for 290 hectares total. The park is the central piece of a 'Green fingers' network of parks that is being established (mostly aligned along around 45 km of streams and creeks draining the Flat Bush catchment). The ecological system involved consultation with groups such as Forest & Bird and the Auckland Regional Council. The water systems also work as stormwater ponds, and have been fitted with fish ladders to ensure connected water habitats. The park (in the already established section) also includes event spaces and large playgrounds for children, with a multi-sports centre, playing fields to be added in the future. The park is to establish a network of educational trails in addition to the main routes. The park received the 'Outstanding Award' of the New Zealand Recreation Association Awards, as well as three awards from the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (Gold: Barry Curtis Park Wetland Playground (at Stancombe Road), Silver: Barry Curtis Park Signature Areas design, Silver: Barry Curtis Park Project Management).

Kramskoi titled the painting Unknown, and did not mention her in any of his letters or diaries, leading to much speculation and the painting's highly enigmatic reputation. Preparatory study The portrait was painted late in Kramskoi's life. He had begun his career as a rebel working outside of the establishment, and was early on expelled from the Russian Academy. By 1883, he was at the height of his fame and reputation and working at the highest level of patronage, producing portraits of Czar Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodorovna. He was also one of the founders and leaders of The Wanderers.Wachtel, 59 However, Portrait of an Unknown Woman caused a sensation when first exhibited, more as a result of the subject matter than the aesthetics of the work. A number of critics presumed that the woman was a prostitute. One critic described the painting as a portrayal of \\"a coquette in a carriage\\", while another wrote of \\"a provocatively beautiful woman, all in velvet and fur, throwing you a sneeringly sensuous glance from a luxurious carriage ‚Äì is this not one of the effluvia of big cities that allow contemptible women dressed in outfits purchased for the price of their female chastity onto the streets\\". Kramskoi remarked, \\"Some people have said it is not known who this woman is. Is she decent, or does she sell herself? But within her is an entire epoch.\\" Pavel Tretyakov refused to buy the painting for his gallery. However, its popularity quickly grew, in part as the beauty of sin became a popular theme amongst the following generation of Russian artists. It has been described as \\"unusually bright, densely painted, and relaxed. Kramskoi clearly tried to shine with his outstanding painterly mastery.\\" The painting has been used as the cover for some editions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.Back Cover ‚Äì In 2008, Guggenheim curator Valerie Hillings observed that, \\"Many people just think she's sort of like Anna Karenina.

Huguet was born in 1871 and registered on official documents as \\"Josefina\\" Huguet. Her first music teacher was Francisco Bonet in Barcelona, where she soon made her operatic debut as Lakm√© at the Teatro Liceu of Barcelona. She subsequently toured several countries, including some South American nations. She performed, too, with success in Italy, appearing for the first time at Milan's La Scala in 1896, where she sang the role of Oph√©lie in Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet. Huguet proved popular in Russia as well. Although Huguet often sang coloratura parts, such as Rosina in Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia, she also undertook the verismo roles of Mim√¨ in Puccini's La Boh√®me and Cio-Cio- San in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, and her recordings even include excerpts from Wagner's Lohengrin (on which she is accompanied by the famous tenor Fernando De Lucia). Indeed, her complete repertoire contained a wide range of roles: from The Queen of Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute to Nedda in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. Huguet's career as a recording artist was not particularly extensive. Her discography consists mainly of arias and ensemble pieces from opera that were recorded by the Gramophone Company, forerunner of EMI. She also sang the role of Nedda in the first complete recording of Pagliacci in 1907 (with the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala di Milano, Carlo Sabajno conducting).

Their first atelier was opened in Paris in 1849 by trunk-makers Octavie and Fran√ßois Coulembier. They joined forces with Pauline Moynat, a specialist in travel goods, to open the first store of avenue de l‚ÄôOpera. Moynat was one of the first leather goods houses of its day. Known for its traditional know-how and skills base in handcrafting made-to-order luggage and travel goods, the house became famous for its designs for the automobiles, as well as for its technical innovations such as making its trunks lighter and waterproof, and for its notable participation in the various World's Fairs. History=The meeting of two families The House of Moynat was the result of a meeting between Pauline Moynat, who sold travel goods in the Opera district of Paris, and the Coulembier family, manufacturers from the faubourgs ‚Äì the inner suburbs to the north of the city. In 1849, the trunk makers opened their first atelier. They then joined forces with Pauline Moynat to open the Moynat boutique in 1869 on what was then the Place du Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais (now the Place Andr√© Malraux) opposite the famous Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. The boutique was situated at the heart of Haussmann‚Äôs redesigned Paris, and following the construction of the Avenue de l'Op√©ra in 1876, it took pride of place at n¬∫.1, later to become the oldest shop on the avenue.L'Illustration The Moynat boutique became an institution, staying open continuously for well over a hundred years until 1976. File:DiligenceMoynatWeb.jpgA Moynat horse cart, 1880 File:PhotoBoutiqueWeb.jpgThe Moynat Boutique Avenue de l'Op√©ra in 1907 File:PhotoBoutiqueInterieurAWeb.jpgInterior of the Moynat Boutique, 1907 The destiny of the House of Moynat and three generations of Coulembier The collaboration between Pauline Moynat and the family of manufacturers began with Fran√ßois Coulembier, continuing with his sons Jules Ferdinand, Edmond, Louis and Maurice. The house reached the height of its commercial powers under the direction of the founder‚Äôs grandsons, profiting from the rise of the automobile to become a design reference in the context of this new mode of transport. The business remained in the hands of the Coulembier family until 1976. The factory In 1907 the Coulembier family began construction on a model-factory at 15, rue Coysevox up at Montmartre. With some 1500m¬≤ of space situated in a four-storey building, the factory employed more than 250 workers, most of whom were specialist artisans, who built all the Moynat trunks. For the first time ever in Paris all the specialist skills associated with trunk-making were gathered together in one place. File:LesFreresCoulembierWeb.jpgThe Coulembier brothers, Moynat directors, 1906 File:PhotoUsineWeb.jpgThe Moynat factory, rue Coysevox in 1907 Innovation Moynat patented its first inventions for packaging materials in 1854.National Industrial Property Institute (France) The label was the first to use hardened gutta-percha waterproofing to produce its trunks and packing boxes. In 1870, Moynat brought out the wicker trunk, known as the \\"English trunk\\" or \\"Moynat trunk\\",Le Gaulois, October 10, 1873 a lightweight structure consisting of a wicker frame, covered with a varnished canvas and leather trimming. The product weighed a mere two kilos and was highly sought after by travellers wishing to avoid excess baggage fees. In 1889 Jules Coulembier perfected a whole new system of lightweight trunks, followed in 1910 by the invention of an extra-light, unbreakable model. The House of Moynat also produced a series of security mechanisms for its trunks. Moynat and the World‚Äôs Fairs Moynat was a regular participant in World's Fairs since the second edition in Paris in 1867. The house also took part in the Exposition universelle in Paris in 1900, Brussels in 1910Comit√© Fran√ßais des Expositions √† l'√âtranger, Groupe XV classe 99, industrie du caoutchouc et de la gutta-percha, exposition universelle et internationale de Bruxelles 1910, Georges Vuitton reporting and was appointed jury member at the Turin exhibition in 1911, and was awarded two gold medals and two special prizes at Ghent in 1913.Comit√© Fran√ßais des Expositions √† l'√âtranger, Groupe XV classe 99, industrie du caoutchouc et de la gutta-percha, exposition universelle et internationale de Gand 1913, Lamy-Thorrilhon reporting However, it was in 1925 that Moynat broke the record at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels,Catalogue G√©n√©ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1867 where its automobile trunks were a great success, awarded a Dipl√¥me d‚ÄôHonneur by its peers together with a number of gold, silver and bronze medals,Journal Officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise, January 5, 1926 a record of achievement that distinguished Moynat as the leading French malletier (trunk maker) of the time. Collaboration with Henri Rapin In 1905, the Moynat began a long lasting collaboration with Henri Rapin, creative director. Rapin designed the logos of the House, the Moynat monogram, illustrated the product catalogues and conceived the models presented at universal and international exhibitions.  After the Coulembier  Moynat closed its boutique at the Place du Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais in 1976. Its trunks however continued to travel around the world. The Scholl family bought the rights to the house in the early 1980s for use by its company Malles et Voyages. Orcofi, the Vuitton family's holding company, bought Malles et Voyages in 1989, following the disposal of the bulk of its shares in LVMH. Orcofi's CEO, Vuitton's former President Henry Racamier, had planned to relaunch Moynat as a competitor to Louis Vuitton. However Orcofi was eventually sold to AXA in 1996 and its assets were stripped, thus the ambitious plans to relaunch Moynat never saw the light of day. The Revival Luxury holding company Luvanis SA bought the rights into Moynat in the late 2000s, developed a revival plan and assigned the brand to Groupe Arnault, LVMH's CEO Bernard Arnault's holding company bought Moynat in 2010. In December 2011, Moynat reopened with a flagship store at 348 rue Saint-Honor√©, followed by shops in London in 2014, Hong Kong, Beijing in 2015, Tokyo, New York, Seoul, Taipei in 2016, Singapore in 2017, and Dubai in 2018.

Blood pressure causes the blood to bleed out at a rapid, intermittent rate in a spray or jet, coinciding with the pulse, rather than the slower, but steady flow of venous bleeding. Also known as arterial bleeding, arterial spurting, or arterial gushing, the amount of blood loss can be copious, occur very rapidly, and can lead to death. Anatomy In cut carotid arteries with 100 mL of blood through the heart at each beat (at 65 beats a minute), a completely severed artery will spurt blood for about 30 seconds and the blood will not spurt much higher than the human head. If the artery is just nicked, on the other hand, the blood will spurt longer but will be coming out under pressure and spraying much further.\\"How writers fill in all the gory details\\", Humphrey Evans, The Guardian, 22 July 2004, retrieved 17 March 2010 To prevent hand ischemia, there is a \\"squirt test\\" that involves squirting blood from the radial artery, which is used in intraoperative assessment of collateral arm blood flow before radial artery harvest.Intraoperative confirmation of ulnar collateral blood flow during radial artery harvesting using the \\"squirt test\\" , Inderpaul Birdi and Andrew J. Ritchie of Papworth Hospital, The Annals of Thoracic Surgery at CTSNet, 2002 This is more commonly called \\"Allen's test\\" by microvascular surgeons, and is used before harvesting radial artery based free tissue transfers (cf Allen's test). In 1933, a murder trial prompted a testimony from Dr. Clement Harrisse Arnold about how far blood could spurt from the neck: vertically and laterally.\\"Medicine: Blood Spurt\\", Time Magazine, 8 April 1935, retrieved 17 March 2010 Iconography Chinnamasta, a self-decapitated Hindu goddess, is depicted holding her head with three jets of blood spurting out of her bleeding neck, which are drunk by her severed head and two attendants. Saint Miliau, a Christian martyr killed c. 6th century AD, is sometimes represented holding his severed head, as in the retable of the Passion of the Christ at Lampaul-Guimiliau, where blood gushes from his neck. Insects and animals Some animals deliberately autohaemorrhage or squirt blood as a defense mechanism. Armored crickets, which are native to Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana, drive away predators by spewing vomit and spurting hemolymph (the mollusk and arthropod equivalent of blood) from under their legs and through slits in their exoskeleton. Katydids do it too, and in Germany the species has acquired the nickname \\"Blutspritzer\\", or \\"blood squirter\\". The regal horned lizard, too, uses the blood-spewing tactic, shooting the substance from a pocket near its eyes.\\"See It to Believe It: Animals Vomit, Spurt Blood to Thwart Predators\\", Allison Bond, Discover Magazine blog, 28 July 2009, retrieved 17 March 2010 One of the oriental rat flea mouth's two functions is to squirt partly digested blood into a bite. In popular culture Squirting blood is used as a visual effect in anime, cartoons, comic books, film (mostly horror ‚Äì particularly slasher ‚Äì and action), literature, television series (mostly horror and drama), theaterUSING STAGE BLOOD, Russell Blackwood, Theatre Bay Area, retrieved 6 April 2010 and video games. Perhaps the earliest epic film to have explicit scenes of blood squirting, often filmed in slow motion, was Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969). It was rated R, then a new category, by the MPAA. The Monty Python sketch Sam Peckinpah's \\"Salad Days\\" (1972) involved an orgy of blood gushing, in a parody of Peckinpah's gore- filled directorial style. In Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), King Arthur must cut off all four limbs of the Black Knight to pass by in a forest, as the Knight bleeds on him. Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel Blood Meridian, Or the Evening Redness in the West includes a scene in which one of the two Jacksons decapitates the other by a campfire, leading to a graphically described blood spurt. In the movie National Lampoon's European Vacation, Clark Griswold hits a cyclist with his car. Blood spews out of the cyclist's hand as he points to give directions. The 1991 film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country has a scene where a Klingon is shot (\\"phasered\\") in zero gravity. The blood that spurts out of the Klingon's wounds was created using computer generated imagery (CGI); the animators had to make sure that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating water globules to match the physics of the blood particles.Altman, Mark (April 1992). \\"Star Trek VI: the making of 'The Undiscovered Country'\\".

He was shortlisted for the Citigroup Photography Prize (now known as the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize) in 2004. Life and career=Early life Fraser bought his first camera at the age of 7. In 1968, at school, Fraser saw Powers of Ten, a film by Charles and Ray Eames which over nine minutes takes the viewer on a journey from a couple picnicking in Chicago, out to the imagined edge of the Universe and back, continuing on down through the skin to an atomic level. Fraser went to school in Wales until 1971, then studied Civil Engineering for three months at Hatfield Polytechnic, England, before deciding to study photography. He studied Photography at Manchester Polytechnic between 1972 and 1976, repeating his final year due to becoming seriously ill after crossing the Sahara Desert in early 1975. Photography Fraser has said that 'The idea that there is no hierarchical relationship between large and small, as everything in the Universe is made of small things, has influenced much of his work and came directly from seeing this film'. Fraser was an early adopter of colour photography in the UK, along with Paul Graham and Martin Parr. He began exhibiting colour photographs in 1982. In 1984, Fraser travelled to Memphis, USA to spend two months with William Eggleston, after meeting him at Eggleston's first UK exhibition opening at the Victoria and Albert Museum the previous year. This experience gave Fraser the confidence to commit to working with colour photography with reference to notions of 'Poetic Truth' rather than notions of 'documentary truth' which prevailed at the time. Therefore, despite the historical pressure of the documentary tradition in British photography at this time Fraser was drawn to making photographs which were in each successive series preoccupied with philosophic and metaphysical questions, alluded to by Ian Jeffrey who said: > \\"...see Peter Fraser, probably the best colourist anywhere now, and as > capable with metaphors as any major poet. Fraser‚Äôs work is complete, full, > in its resonances and layered meanings, rich with the sort of richness you > might find in Chardin or Vermeer.\\"Ian Jeffrey, \\"British Photography > Flourishes\\", Camera Austria 1988, pp58-61 1983 - 1990 Between 1983 and 1986, Fraser made the exhibitions, Twelve Day Journey, The Valleys Project, Everyday Icons and Towards an Absolute Zero which led to his first publication Two Blue Buckets in 1988. This book won the Bill Brandt Award hosted by the Photographers' Gallery in 1989 and led to an international audience for Fraser‚Äôs work. In 1990 Fraser was invited to be the British Artist in Residence in Marseilles, which led to the subsequent exhibition and publication Ice and Water in which, through the shimmering heat of the Mediterranean summer his subject had become the space between and around objects. \\"Untitled\\" from The Valleys Project, 1985 1990s Having been a chess enthusiast as a boy, and having been deeply impressed by Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs 2001: A Space Odyssey, he travelled to many countries in the world in the early 1990s to scientific research establishments photographing machines at the cutting edge of technology, proposing a series of ‚ÄòPortraits‚Äô of machines shown and published as ‚ÄòDeep Blue‚Äô. This idea had been encouraged by IBM designers of the chess computer Deep Blue speaking on their website of sensing the first signs of consciousness in the computer that finally beat Garry Kasparov, the World Chess champion in 1997. While visiting nearly 60 scientific sites, Fraser frequently photographed in scientific ‚ÄòClean Rooms‚Äô where particles of dust above a certain size were not admitted. Subsequently, pondering these small particles with ‚ÄòPowers Of Ten‚Äô in mind, Fraser decided to start photographing ‚Äòdirt and other low status‚Äô material. Simultaneous to this work was a University of Strathclyde commission to make new Art in their Applied Physics Department, where research was being undertaken into the fundamental nature of matter at a subatomic level. This led to these two series being combined into a single new series of photographs, Material in which a democratic notion of all material was proposed. This work was published in 2002. 2000s In 2002 The Photographers' Gallery (London) showed a 20-year overview of Fraser‚Äôs work, drawing on photographs from a number of his series making a distinction between very large scale ‚ÄòImages‚Äô which became part of the architecture of the gallery space and framed ‚ÄòWorks‚Äô hung from the walls. In 2004 Fraser was shortlisted (with Robert Adams, David Goldblatt and Joel Sternfeld) for the Citigroup (formally Citibank) International Photography Prize at the Photographers‚Äô Gallery for work which had been exhibited the previous year in the first Brighton Biennial. These photographs were the outcome of a synthesis between two preoccupations, namely his continuing conviction that small things are important, and that the surface of the earth more than ever looks the way it does because the human brain directs the hand to change the shape and nature of materials. This work was subsequently published by Nazraeli Press, USA in 2006. In his text for this book Gerry Badger wrote: > It may seem a long way-and some might feel the connections a mite far > fetched-from the simple depiction of objects contained in Peter Fraser‚Äôs > series, to the universe. But this, nevertheless is what Fraser is asking us > to think about as we puzzle over these straightforward yet enigmatic images. > In each photograph, he brings a forensic attention upon these everyday > objects, yet however elegant each image is in itself, it is the linkages- > both causal and casual-we might find between each one, jointly and > severally, that we are asked to contemplate. In these relations, Peter > Fraser is finding a poetic equivalent not just of the unity of opposites, > but also to the simple, obvious yet profound idea expressed by Charles > Eames: \\"Eventually, everything connects.\\" Gerry Badger, \\"Eventually, > everything connects.\\" 2005, From Peter Fraser, Nazraeli Monograph, Nazraeli > Press, USA, 2006 . Reproduced here in Fraser's website. \\"Untitled\\" from Nazraeli Monograph (2006) In early 2006 Fraser was invited to be an Artist in Residence at Oxford University to make new art with photography for the Biochemistry Department. The department had commissioned the demolition of several older buildings in which it was housed, to make way for a newly commissioned landmark building. Fraser visited Oxford twice a month for two and a half years making photographs at first in the midst of the demolition process using lower saturation colour film, and then changing to brighter colour film once the construction phase began. In 2009 Fraser was commissioned by Ffotogallery, Wales, to make new work across the entire country during that year. This resulted in the exhibition and publication Lost For Words, the first time Fraser had worked entirely digitally. These works were shown and published in spring 2010, of which Mark Durden in his accompanying essay observed that: > There is a dark strain running through many of Frasers new pictures. The > sensuousness, beauty and idealism in his photography of objects is countered > by a sense of the impermanence, incomprehensibility and meaninglessness of > things. Objects exist not so much for us but against us, obdurate, enigmatic > and other.Mark Durden, From 'Lost for Words', 2010. In 2012 Fraser exhibited ‚ÄòA City in the Mind‚Äô at Brancolini Grimaldi Gallery, London. This was a series of photographs inspired by Italo Calvino‚Äôs book ‚ÄòInvisible Cities‚Äô, in which the Tartar Emperor Kublai Khan discusses with Marco Polo cities in his empire Marco has visited on the Emperor‚Äôs behalf, but for the Emperor can only remain ‚Äò‚ÄôCities in the Mind. > ‚ÄúIn London I have been making work which even though needing physical > subjects for the images, collectively suggest a City which we cannot > physically visit, but can only in our imagination through the book and > exhibitions of the photographs‚Äù.cited from the afterword in Peter Fraser‚Äôs > ‚ÄòA City in the Mind‚Äô published by Steidl Brancolini Grimaldi 2012 In 2013 Tate St Ives exhibited a selected retrospective of Fraser‚Äôs work, and published a monograph containing photographs from all of Fraser's major series to date, 12 day Journey (1984), Ice and Water (1993), Deep Blue (1997), Lost for Words (2010) and A City in the Mind (2012).Peter Fraser, edited by Martin Clark and Sara Matson, Tate Publishing, 2013. . This was the first Tate retrospective for a living British photographer working in colour. In 2013 Fraser received an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society. In 2014 Tate purchased 10 works from the mid 1980s for their permanent collection. In Spring 2017 Peperoni Books, Berlin, published a new 'Director's Cut' of Fraser's 1988 publication Two Blue Buckets with 19 missing images from the original, and a new essay by Gerry Badger and a discussion between Fraser and David Campany. From 1 June - 31 July 2017 Fraser's exhibition Mathematics was exhibited at the Real Jardin de Botanico, Madrid, part of PhotoEspana 17, and Skinnerboox, Italy, published Mathematics with 52 colour plates, and essays by Mark Durden, David Campany and an afterword by Fraser. The first UK exhibition of Mathematics opened at Camden Arts Centre, London, on 5 July and ran until 16 September 2018.

Forming out of an area of convection several hundred kilometres southwest of India on October 1 2004, Cyclone Onil quickly attained its peak intensity on October 2 with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). However, dry air quickly entered the system, causing it to rapidly weaken to a depression just off the coast of Gujarat, India. Over the following several days, the system took a slow, erratic track towards the south-southeast. After turning northeastward, the system made landfall near Porbandar on October 10 and dissipated shortly thereafter. Throughout southeastern Pakistan and northwestern India, thousands of residents were evacuated prior to the cyclone's arrival. In these areas, the storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall, peaking at in Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan. These rains led to flash flooding in several areas. Nine people died in several incidents related to the storm in Karachi. The drainage system of Hyderabad sustained significant damage, leading to several protests and demonstrations by city residents. Offshore, 300 fishermen are believed to have gone missing during the storm; no reports have confirmed their whereabouts since they disappeared. Meteorological history Severe Cyclonic Storm Onil was first identified as an area of convection early on September 30, 2004 situated roughly 465 km (290 mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. Satellite imagery depicted a poorly organized system with deep convection partially surrounding a low-level circulation. Situated over warm water and within an area of moderate wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system's chances of developing into a tropical cyclone as \\"fair\\". Within several hours of being identified, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the system as Depression ARB 03. Despite a decrease in convection later on September 30, the IMD upgraded the cyclone to a deep depression, stating that three-minute sustained winds had reached 55 km/h (35 mph). Early the next day, organization substantially improved, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Around 0900 UTC on October 1, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to Cyclonic Storm Onil. Upon being named, the storm became the first tropical cyclone on record to be named in the northern Indian Ocean. The WMO/ESCAP Panel agreed in May 2004 that in September, tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean attaining gale-force winds would be given names. Later on October 1, the JTWC issued their first advisory on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 03A. Tracking towards the northeast, Onil intensified as convection consolidated around the center of circulation. Roughly 24 hours after being named, the system attained its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg) according to the IMD with. Upon reaching this strength, the system featured a pinhole eye surrounded by deep convection. Additionally, Dvorak technique intensity estimates reached 3.5, indicating a high-end tropical storm. However, the JTWC stated maximum winds to be 65 km/h (40 mph), a low-end tropical storm. As the storm neared the Indian coastline, dry air quickly entered the circulation, causing most of the convection associated with Onil to dissipate. Located within 100 km (65 mi) of land, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression and the IMD downgraded Onil to a deep depression. On October 3, the center of Onil skimmed the coastline of northwestern India; however, the center did not cross land. Around this time, the upper-level circulation detached from the low-level circulation, further weakening the storm. Early on October 4, the JTWC stated that the system had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system. After executing a counter-clockwise loop, the depression slowly tracked south-southeastward, away from land. By October 7, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression by the JTWC as it stalled several hundred kilometres southwest of Gujarat, India. The system maintained a relatively low intensity for the following several days before making landfall near Porbandar with winds of 45 km/h (30 mph). Within hours of moving inland, Onil dissipated early on October 10. Impact and aftermath Microwave satellite image of Cyclone Onil on October 2 depicting the pinhole eye In northwestern India, thousands of residents were evacuated in fears of Onil striking the region. According to one of the evacuated residents, this was the seventh evacuation due to a cyclone in the area since 1999. On October 10, the storm's remnants brought light to moderate rainfall in India; there was no known rainfall amount exceeding throughout the region. In southeastern Pakistan, an estimated 6,000 people were evacuated from coastal regions prior to Cyclone Onil's arrival. Port officials warned fishermen not to venture out during the storm due to rough seas. Cyclone Onil brought moderate to heavy rainfall and gusty winds. A maximum of of rain fell in Thatta, Sindh between October 2 and 3. In Hyderabad, heavy rains amounting to caused a section of a drainage system to collapse, prompting the evacuation of several hundred residents. Throughout Sindh, an estimated of land was inundated by flood waters, destroying roughly 70% of the cotton crop. In the city of Karachi, nine people were killed in various incidents related to the storm at least winds were reported. Two people were killed after being electrocuted by a downed power line outside their home. Many streets in the city were flooded and power lines were downed. Another one of these people died while trying to clear a drain near her house when a wall collapsed on her. Offshore, 163 fishermen were reported to be missing after being caught in the storm. However, reports from Pakistani officials stated that at least 300 fishermen were missing. In other areas, power was lost for more than 48 hours after Onil moved through the region. Around Karo Gongro, 100 people were stranded along a major roadway after flash flooding struck the area. In the wake of the storm, Pakistani officials set up 26 relief camps where residents were offered food and shelter. Roughly 3,000 people sought refuge in these shelters. Mobile units were also set up by the District Health Department to minimize the impacts of any post-storm diseases. On October 3, Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed his grief over the damage caused by Cyclonic Storm Onil and stated that he would be touring the affected region within the following days. At least 40 million Pakistani rupee ($469,000 USD) was allocated in relief funds by Sindh Minister Syed Papoo Shah. On October 4, port officials stated that it was safe for fishermen to resume their activities in the Arabian Sea. Later that day, a rain emergency was declared for Hyderabad and emergency shelters were set up in the city. All officers in the Hyderabad Development Authority who were initially put on leave ahead of the cyclone were told to resume work to assist in clearing drainage systems. Several days after the storm, reports indicated that there were more than 300 instances where the city's drainage system collapsed across the area, resulting in standing water in many structures. Residents in these areas, frustrated by the lack of quick action by the government, began holding protests about the flooding. In response to these protests, Shaukat Hayat Bhutto suspended Assistant Engineer Sewage manager, Qamar Memon, for his negligence on draining flood waters.

During a 13-year professional career he played in more than 300 competitive matches for Athletic Bilbao, winning one La Liga championship. Club career Born in Eibar, Gipuzkoa, Guisasola made his senior debut with local SD Eibar at the age of 17, going on to play one-and-a- half seasons in Tercera Divisi√≥n there. In late January 1971 he was bought by Basque giants Athletic Bilbao, making his official debut on the 31st in a 2‚Äì0 La Liga home win over RC Celta de Vigo, with his team eventually finishing fifth and qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Midway through the 1971‚Äì72 campaign, manager Ronnie Allen was fired, but Guisasola was by now an essential defensive unit for Athletic. During his spell with the club he started as a full back, moved to central defender, was also deployed as a defensive midfielder and finished again in the defensive wings; in two consecutive seasons under Milorad Paviƒá he scored ten league goals combined, with Bilbao also winning the 1973 edition of the Copa del Rey. In 1975‚Äì76, Guisasola played very little under coach Rafael Iriondo, who also tried to reconvert him in to forward. He regained his importance after the latter's departure, helping the side to two finals in 1977 (both lost, the UEFA Cup against Juventus F.C. and the domestic cup against Real Betis) and being named by L'√âquipe Europe's best stopper. During the better part of his career, Guisasola struggled with weight problems, and his production was highly inconsistent in his final years. An injury to starter Jos√© Ram√≥n Alexanko ‚Äì later of FC Barcelona fame ‚Äì propelled him to the starting XI once again, and he helped Athletic finish seventh in the 1979‚Äì80 season; as they won the league in 1983, under Javier Clemente, he only contributed with four appearances (151 minutes). Guisasola retired in May 1983 at almost 31, having appeared in 334 official matches for Athletic Bilbao, with neighbouring Real Sociedad being invited to his testimonial match. Subsequently, he lost all connection to the football world.

Apart from his scientific career, he was also an educationist and a follower of Gandhian philosophy in post-independence India, specifically in his domicile state Gujarat.  Biography =Early life  P. C. Vaidya was born in Shahpur of Junagadh district, Gujarat, India on 23 May 1918. He completed most of his schooling in Bhavnagar, and went to Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay) for higher studies. There, after finishing high school at Ismail Yusuf College, he joined the Institute of Science (then known as Royal Institute of Science) in Mumbai. He received a BSc degree, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. He completed a MSc degree with Applied Mathematics major. Vaidya's first stint at teaching was at the Dharmendra Singhji College in Rajkot, where he joined as a lecturer in 1940, soon after completing his MSc examinations. Vaidya taught trigonometry and arithmetic to undergraduate students. The college was then managed by the St Xavier's College, Bombay for half the term, after which the royal family of Rajkot under His Highness Pradyumansinhji Lakhajirajsinhji, the 14th Thakore Saheb of Rajkot, took control of the college. Due to differences with the new management, Vaidya resigned in 1941 and subsequently started with freedom fighter Prithvi Singh Azad at the Ahimsak Vyayam Sangh institute of physical education, where he was the principal for non-violent struggle training programme for youths. Meanwhile, he continued teaching mathematics by conducting private tuition for school students.Vaidya, PC: Chalk ane Duster (Chalk and duster, Vaidya's memoirs as a teacher) (2011) Suganitam Prakashan, Ahmedabad In 1942, P. C. Vaidya wrote to Professor Vishnu Vasudev Narlikar, father of Indian physicist Jayant Narlikar, expressing his desire to study relativity. Narlikar approved this, and Vaidya immediately moved to Banaras Hindu University(BHU), Varanasi, where Narlikar was a faculty member at the school of relativity. Vaidya was at Banaras for about ten months. At that time, India's freedom struggle was at full steam with Mahatma Gandhi leading the Quit India movement. The political situation was also chaotic due to World War II. Vaidya was living with his wife Vidya and six-month-old daughter Kumud and surviving solely on his earlier savings. Gandhi went on a prolonged fast then, which led to a period of great uncertainty as the fast had affected his health adversely. Desperate to know the developments, Vaidya would eagerly await the Hindi evening daily Aaj. Amid the tension, the idea of spacetime geometry sprouted in his mind. Within a week, Vaidya came up with the Vaidya Metric.Professor Vaidya, a film on Prof. P. C. Vaidya, Vigyan Prasar department, Government of India (2007) Professor Vaidya obtained his Doctoral degree (PhD) in mathematics in 1949.  Professional career  Vaidya inaugurating 19th volume of 350px After his research stint at BHU, he went to a number of places to teach mathematics, including science institutions in Surat, Rajkot and Mumbai. During a small period of 1947 ‚Äì 48, he went to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research as a research associate. There he became associated with Homi Bhabha, father of India's nuclear program. Due to accommodation constraints, he left Mumbai, and continued the rest of his academic career in Gujarat. From 1948 to 1971, he taught at various colleges including: V. P. College, Vallabh Vidyanagar; Gujarat College, Ahmedabad; M.N. College, Visnagar; and University School of Sciences, Gujarat University. Vaidya was a recipient of the Bombay University's Springer Research Scholarship. Vaidya's initial research under this scholarship resulted in a paper that he sent to Robert Oppenheimer, who appreciated the paper and sent it to the American Physical Society journal Physical Review. The journal published the paper in 1951.Vaidya, PC (1951): \\"Nonstatic Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations for Spheres of Fluids Radiating Energy\\", Phys. Rev. 83, 10 In 1971, he was appointed Chairman of Gujarat Public Service Commission. This was followed by Union Public Service Commission membership during 1977 ‚Äì 78, during which he served Central Government. His final professional benchmark was the Vice-Chancellorship of Gujarat University during 1978 ‚Äì 80.  Doctoral Students  Hasmukh M. Raval; Mathematics Department, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, India Thesis: Theoretical Studies on Rotating Universes in Relativistic Cosmology; 1972  International contributions  During 1964 to 1973, Vaidya served as visiting professor at number of international universities, including: * Visiting Professor of Mathematics at Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, US. * Visiting Professor of Mathematics at London University (Queen Elizabeth College), York University and Newcastle University in UK. * Visiting Scientist at Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, Dublin, Ireland. * Visiting Scientist at International Centre for Theoretical Physics at Trieste, Italy. In June 1971, he delivered a very informative course of lectures at the Institut Henri Poincare, Paris in June 1971. In July 1971, he attended the 6th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation at Copenhagen.  Death  For the last several years, Vaidya had confined himself to his Shardanagar house in Ahmedabad due to deteriorating health. He was diagnosed with a kidney ailment in January 2010. He died on 12 March 2010 at Ahmedabad. He had four daughters, Kumud, Smita, Darshana and Hina.  Work  Albert Einstein's theory of gravity is described by a set of equations which use the mathematics of Riemannian geometry. Professor Vaidya took up on this mission, and accomplished pioneering work which led to conception of such a solution. The result was the Vaidya Metric. Professor Vaidya's research on general theory of relativity was started when he went to Banaras Hindu University in 1942, where he joined the school of relativity started by Professor V. V. Narlikar. It was only ten months that he spent at BHU at that time, during which the revolutionary idea of developing a spacetime geometry was born within him, which would describe the gravitational potentials in the exterior of a radiating star. There was pioneering work done around the same area, but it was helpful up to some extent. The well-known Schwarzschild Solution describes the geometry around a spherical star. However, it necessarily assumes the exterior of the star to be empty. Vaidya generalised this case to incorporate the radiation from the star, and the resulting solution was the famous Vaidya metric. Vaidya is known to be one of the pioneers of the Golden age of general relativity. His discovery of the Vaidya Metric gave him a worldwide reputation at the age of 24, even before the beginning of his professional career.  The Vaidya Metric  Vaidya Metric applies to a set Einstein's equations that describes the gravitational field of a star which has a sizeable radiation. It pioneered the key idea of using the light rays as a co-ordinate frame. In other words, it was an idea of a null co-ordinate, which eventually played extremely significant role in subsequent research in gravitation theory during forthcoming decades. The Vaidya metric has by now found many applications in gravitation theory. It is widely used and internationally cited to study many problems in gravitation and general relativity.  Contributions to scientific community  In February 1969, in an occasion to felicitate Professor V. V. Narlikar on his 60th birthday, Professor Vaidya made a proposition to found a society of Indian relativists. The result was the Indian Association for General Relativity and Gravitation (IAGRG), and Professor V. V. Narlikar assumed the position of founder President. At his suggestion, Vikram Sarabhai laid foundation of mathematics laboratory in Ahmedabad, a pioneering institute of its kind in India. It is known today as the Community Science Center. Professor Vaidya also established the Gujarat Mathematical Society.  Professional affiliations  * Founder member of the Indian Association for General Relativity and Gravitation (IAGRG). * Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (F.A.Sc.). * Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (F.N.A). * President of Calcutta Mathematical Society for 2 years. * Honorary Fellow of Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. * President of the Indian Mathematical Society ‚Äì 1976 and 1977. * A Founder Member of an International Journal \\"General Relativity and Gravitation\\", which is published from Berne, Switzerland. * Member of Indian National Committee on Astronomy- 1976 to 1979. * President of the UGC Committee on Relativity and Cosmology. * Participated in activities that led to revision of state-level syllabi of Mathematics textbooks. * Founded Gujarat Ganit Mandal in 1964 in Bhavnagar. He presided over it in 1964 and 1988. Since inception, it organises programs in rural areas periodically to spread mathematics across all layers of society.  Literary work  Professor Vaidya's profound scientific contributions had phenomenal impact in journals and publications. During his life, he authored or co-authored more than thirty research papers in General Relativity and Gravitation. They are cited quite frequently in the field research since their publication. In his efforts to popularise mathematics among Indian students, Professor Vaidya started 'Suganitam' mathematics magazine in 1960s. Since its inception, it has been continually read in numerous schools and colleges, and has inspired generations of mathematics teachers and students alike. He authored several popular science books in Gujarati: * Akhil Brahamandman (\\"In the entire Universe\\") * Dashansh Paddhati Sha Mate? (\\"Why Decimal System?\\") * Dadaji Ni Vato (\\"Grandpa's Tales\\") ‚Äì a collection of science stories for children * What is Modern Mathematics? * Ganit Darshan (\\"Discourses in Mathematics\\"). This book won the 1970‚Äì71 prize for Gujarati Scientific Literature from the Gujarat State Government. Besides, Vaidya published several memoirs from his days as a teacher, such as 'Chalk ane Duster' (Chalk and Duster), and 'America ane apne' (America and Us), which are from his days as a visiting professor at the Washington State University. He also wrote mathematical and scientific articles in the leading Gujarati cultural magazine, Kumar, founded by Kalaguru Ravishankar Raval, the leading painter, art teacher, art critic, journalist and essayist from Gujarat.  Thought  Professor Vaidya was known among his colleagues and friends as staunch follower of Gandhian principles ‚Äì simplicity and honesty. Even in his old age, he used to ride a bicycle. He strongly believed that for a mathematician, his brain was the best tool in itself, and research had very less dependency over resources or money. His lectures, always delivered using a chalk and black board, never failed to captivate the student. His memoirs of his teaching and research are titled 'Chalk and Duster' ‚Äì his tools of learning and teaching mathematics. Rather than being limited to opinions, he was quite pragmatic in living out his principles. Honesty in public and personal life was his another remarkable trait. According to his close aides, even during peak years of his scientific career, he exercised extreme prudence and wisdom in using his influence for personal gains of his family, or people related to him. Spending his senior years in Gujarat University, he initiated statewide efforts to revolutionise mathematics and science education ‚Äì his motivation being \\"I am the highest paid mathematics teacher in Gujarat. It cannot be (limited) for teaching MSc classes.\\" As a visionary educationist, he felt a top-down need to change the way mathematics training was imparted to students, and began programs to educate mathematics teachers on \\"How to teach mathematics.\\" He frequently interacted with primary students, and tried to awaken their curiosity in mathematics. His foundation of Gujarat Mathematical Society in Bhavnagar, 1964 was aimed at this objective. He tried to reach to farthest rural areas, and aimed the society's efforts to empower teachers and eradicate fear of the subject from students' minds.

With neighbouring Goring Wood it forms one of the last remaining blocks of ancient woodland on the West Sussex coastal plain. Since 2006 land in and around the wood has been the site of a proposed major urban extension to the Worthing suburb of West Durrington. The proposed development has prompted environmental protestors to tree-sit within the wood since May 2006. Since then Worthing Borough Council has agreed to a substantial new housing development just to the east of the woods themselves, as an extension of Durrington. This includes a new school, doctors surgery and around 2000 new houses on agricultural land. Though the ancient woodland itself would not be destroyed because of this, the large increase in people will inevitably lead to the degradation of the forest due to fly-tipping and other unsavoury activities, such as drug use, which is in much evidence in the pockets of woodland remaining in Durrington itself. Titnore wood is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, as is neighbouring Goring Wood and Highdown Hill. Much of the site lies within the boundaries of the new South Downs National Park. Location Titnore wood lies to the north-west of Worthing, a large town on the coast of West Sussex. The wood was formerly part of the Castle Goring estate, a grade I listed country house built at the end of the 18th century for Sir Bysshe Shelley, grandfather of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Titnore wood lies to the east of Titnore Lane, an ancient droveway from the coastal plain onto the South Downs. To the south of the wood lies a lake, known as Titnore Lake or Castle Goring Lake. The lake is fed by streams from surrounding farmland which in turn feeds the Ferring Rife which flows into the English Channel at Ferring. Proposed development In 2003 a new greenfield development was put forward for 875 homes by the West Durrington Consortium, a group made of Heron Corporation, Bryant Homes (part of Taylor Woodrow) and Persimmon Homes. The proposal required the loss of around 275 trees including some from the proposal to straighten Titnore Lane to improve the flow of traffic. In May 2006 a group of around 25 environmentalist protesters squatted the wood, constructing tree houses and a network of tunnels. In July 2006, the landowner was granted a possession order from the High Court to remove the protesters. In March 2010 councillors at Worthing Borough Council voted unanimously to reject the development plans. Flora and fauna Oak and ash are the predominant species in the wood. There are frequent silver birch, field maple, hazel and common hawthorn. Mammals include mole, shrew, dormouse, bank vole, woodmouse, grey squirrel, weasel, fox, as well as various bat species. Species of bat which can be found in the wood including the pipistrelle bat, serotine bat, Natterer's bat, noctule bat and long-eared bat. Species of bird found include Eurasian jay, common pheasant, common chaffinch, carrion crow, wood pigeon, robin, chiffchaff, wren, magpie, dunnock, great spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, tree creeper, tawny owl, common kestrel, great tit, long-tailed tit, blackbird, nuthatch and whitethroat.

The first jet-powered transport built for the United States Air Force, it was intended for use as a high-speed transport for high-priority cargo and personnel. The XC-123A was determined to have insufficient advantages over existing types in service, and did not go into production. The sole prototype was converted into the piston-powered Stroukoff YC-123D to evaluate boundary layer control systems. Design and development In the late 1940s, Chase Aircraft had developed the XG-20, the largest glider ever built in the United States.Sergievsky et al. 1998, p.128 By the time it was ready for operations, however, U.S. military doctrine had been altered to remove the requirement for the use of transport gliders in combat.Mitchell 1992, p.164. However, the XG-20's aircraft had been designed to allow for the easy installation of power plants, and Chase modified the two prototypes into powered aircraft, one becoming the XC-123, with twin piston engines.Adcock 1992, p.4. The second XG-20, however, was taken in hand for a more radical reconfiguration, being fitted with two twin-jet engine pods, of the type used by the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 bombers, to become the XC-123A. As there was no provision for housing fuel in the former glider's wings, fuel tanks were installed underneath the cabin floor. Operational history Dubbed \\"Avitruc\\" by its manufacturer,Air League 1975, p. 113. the XC-123A conducted its maiden flight on April 21, 1951, becoming the first jet-powered transport aircraft to successfully fly in the United States. It was considered \\"excellent\\" in flight trials, with the aircraft showing few vices, and demonstrating reasonably good short-field capability. Despite this, even as the XC-123 proved successful, the XC-123A failed to win sufficient favor in flight testing to receive a production order. Although the aircraft's short- field performance was good, on rough, unimproved fields the low-slung jet pods would suck debris into the intakes, damaging the engines. In addition, the aircraft's design was mismatched to its engines,Sweetman 1979, p.97. resulting in the XC-123A being incapable of providing sufficient cargo capacity compared to the amount of fuel its jet engines required. As a result, the XC-123A project was abandoned without additional aircraft being built. Following the conclusion of trials, the XC-123A was converted to be powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engines, and was used for boundary layer control trials as the Stroukoff YC-123D, receiving serial number 53‚Äì8068.Baugher 2010aBaugher 2010b Specifications (XC-123A) The XC-123A See alsoReferences ;Notes ;Bibliography   * * External links * C-123A Jet Avitruc Category:1940s United States military transport aircraft Category:Quadjets Category:High-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1951 ","title":"Chase XC-123A"},{"id":"26588565","text":"Alex Jurshevski is a Canadian international finance professional, of Russian descent who has become a prominent commentator in Iceland on the 2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis.http://www.recoverypartners.biz/team/Alex_Jurshevski.htmhttp://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=29314&ew;_0_a_id=359325 He has a company - Recovery Partners - and has previously worked in various financial roles.

History The NPA‚Äôs origins can be traced to 1921, when the Retail Pharmacists‚Äô Union (RPU) was founded as a body to respond to a need of representation for pharmacists in employment matters and regulate industry prices. George A. Mallinson was appointed as the RPU‚Äôs first Secretary (giving his name to the NPA‚Äôs current headquarters, Mallinson House, a listed building in St Albans, Hertfordshire). In 1932 the Retail Pharmacists‚Äô Union (RPU) was renamed the National Pharmaceutical Union (NPU) with a membership of 90% of retail chemists. Following the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the NPU established itself on a number of key government committees. One committee - the National Health Insurance Committee (1947) became the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) which continues to operate as a notable industry organisation to this day. In 1977 the NPU was renamed The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) and in 1978 moved to its current day headquarters. 1983 saw the NPA launch the ‚ÄòAsk Your Pharmacist‚Äô campaign, a tradition that continues to this day promoting the work of pharmacy year-round, culminating in ‚ÄòAsk Your Pharmacist Week‚Äô. Function The NPA describes itself as there to ‚Äòhelp independent pharmacies to prosper, professionally and commercially, for the benefit ultimately of the patients and communities they serve‚Äô. The NPA‚Äôs core functions are to offer insurance and legal service and business & practice advice and act as the representative voice of the sector to government and regulatory bodies. Additional roles are updating members on recent developments in the sector, new drugs coming to market, and offering training and education. It also mediates with the NHS, on behalf of its members and offers Patient Group Directions. The NPA is officially designated as the Medication Safety Officer for all independent community pharmacies in England with fewer than 50 branches. In this role the NPA shares good practice in relation to medicines safety and acts as an interface with the Department of Health and Social Care on this matter. Criticism of online pharmacies The NPA have been critical of the British Government's push for increased online pharmacy services citing that more online pharmacies would result in \\"fewer pharmacies for the public to visit\\" . A 2017 survey commissioned by the NPA found that 69% of respondents are against a \\"shift away from local pharmacies\\" towards online only pharmacies such as Pharmacy2U or Chemist 4 U. Structure The NPA is a not for profit organisation, and any surplus is invested in member services. The Association is governed by a Board made up of owners of independent pharmacies from across the UK. Mark Lyonette, became Chief Executive in June 2018.

At a junction to the west of Tyldesley railway station, the line to Wigan North Western railway station headed north west via Chowbent, Hindley and Platt Bridge to Springs Branch near Wigan. The timber built Chowbent Station was situated on an embankment accessed by steps and was renamed Howe Bridge in 1901. The station joined the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping in 1923. It passed to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It closed on 20 July 1959. Coal deposits were the chief motivation for building a railway in the area and the railway's supporters included many local colliery owners and industrialists. A connection to Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Chanters Colliery was provided by the LNWR to the east of the station. Colliery locomotives would sometimes work through the station.

It was named after the town of Mojave in southern California, U.S. 350px The crater is located within the Martian Xanthe Terra region. Description Mojave has alluvial fans that look remarkably similar to landforms in the Mojave Desert in the American southwest. Fans inside and around the outsides of the crater are closely similar to Earth's alluvial fans. As on Earth, the largest rocks are near the mouths of the fans. Because the channels start at ridge tops, it is believed they were formed by heavy downpours. Researchers have suggested that the rain may have been initiated by impacts. Some parts of the crater display a high concentration of closely spaced pits. Pits show little or no evidence of rims or ejecta. The pits are so close to each other that adjacent pits often share the same wall. It is believed that the pits form from steam produced when the heat from the impact process interacts with ice in the ground.Boyce, J. et al. 2012. Origin of small pits in Martian impact craters. Icarus: 221, 262-275.Tornabene, L., et al. 2012. Widespread crater-related pitted materials on Mars: Further evidence for the role of target volatiles during the impact process. Icarus: 220, 348-368. The depth of Mojave is approximately 2,600 meters (1.63 miles). Based on its ratio of depth to diameter, researchers believe it is very young. It is not old enough to have accumulated much material and start to fill. Its relatively undegraded state helps scientists model impact processes on Mars. If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios. Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.Garvin, J., et al. 2002. Global geometric properities of martian impact craters. Lunar Planet Sci. 33. Abstract @1255. Mojave is a rayed crater, another indication of its youth, and is the largest such crater on Mars. Based on crater counts of its ejecta blanket, it is thought to be about 3 million years old. It is believed to be the most recent crater of its size on Mars, and has been identified as the probable source of the shergottite meteorites collected on Earth. However, the latter hypothesis is controversial. Gallery Image:Wikimojave.jpgMojave as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter).

Madhu starring Suresh Gopi and Kavya Madhavan in lead roles. The film's plot is inspired by the 2007 Thai movie Alone which itself is loosely based on Agatha Christie's novel Elephants Can Remember. Plot Internationally famous Indian sharp shooter Nadiya Mether (Kavya Madhavan) catches Sauparnika Express, a train on its inaugural run between Chennai and Mangalore. She is stabbed en route but is not the only victim on the train. A famous dancer, Thulasimani and a television reporter, Shreya Maria, are also killed during the same journey and in the same compartment. When the investigators fail to solve the mystery, the case is finally turned over to Sharafuddeen Taramasi IPS (Suresh Gopi), an encounter specialist from the Railway Anti-Criminal Task Force (RACT). RACT discovers that the three murders are not inter-connected, rather it was sheer coincidence that they all happened the same night. The passengers in the compartment during the inaugural journey apart from the three victims were an actress Priya Rose, her mother Rajamma (Bindu Panicker) and father, four doctors returning from a medical conference, a Tamil Novelist Seetharaman (Vijay Menon), Palakkad Railway SP Alexander (Subair), Madhavan Master, his wife and their mentally unstable son Balachandran (Vijayakumar) \\"Balu\\". TTR Muthuraj (Suraj Venjaramoodu) and attender Sundareshan (Anoop Chandran) are also present. As the train teaches Madukarai station, Balu is spotted with a blade in hand apparently after stabbing Nadiya who goes unconscious. Simultaneously Shreya goes missing only to be found dead later near Salem, and Thulasimani is found dead hanging on the roof of her coupe which was locked from the inside. The coach is removed from the train for investigation and SI Mayilvahanam (Rajan P. Dev) questions all of the passengers having no answer to either of the cases. Upon questioning Muthuraj, he reveals to Sharafuddeen about meeting an additional passenger that night, who is identified as Lakkidi Manikandan (Baburaj), a killer in disguise of a police constable. After severe questioning Mani admits killing Shreya, the reporter. She was behind Alexander IPS, who was highly indulged in smuggling. Shreya followed him into the train and into the compartment, to make a hot story about the goods he carried on board. However, Alexender overhears Shreya's mobile conversations, which makes him suspicious and discovers her identity card from her bag. He arranged Mani to kill her, and when the train reached near Salem, Shreya is thrown away from the moving train, which kills her. After getting Seetharaman's statement, Sharafuddeen questions Balu who was spotted first near a seemingly-dead Nadiya. It was Dr. Mathangi, one of the doctors in the compartment who spotted Balu with a surgical blade in hand and thereby informed all her co-passengers. Madhavan master spots that Nadiya is still alive and asks everyone to take her to the hospital. In the present-day Balu undergoes treatment at a mental asylum and in his subconscious mind, reveals to Sharafuddeen that he came out of his coupe that night to meet Priya who was his crush during college days, but sees a stabbed and injured Nadiya instead with the blade used to stab her left behind. As Balu took the blade in hand for checking, Mathangi sees him thereby leading to the rest of the events. With the help of Mayilvahanam, Sharafuddeen apprehends Priya and her mother Rajamma who are indulged in smuggling of gold. The latter reveals that she had borrowed a surgical blade from the doctors to slice mangoes. When it is revealed that the same blade was used to stab Nadiya, Rajamma reveals that they have no connection with the murder. She also tells that during the journey, Priya inadvertently ran into Madhavan who is angry at her as well as her mother who are responsible for Balu's mental problems. And while looking for Madhavan, Rajamma spots someone entering Thulasimani's coupe but couldn't identify the person. However in an identification parade arranged by Sharafuddeen, Rajamma reveals that it was attender Sundareshan who entered the coupe that night. Upon being questioned, Sundaran reveals that he is the murderer. Since the reasons given by him are unconvincing, Sharafuddeen attempts to torture him that forces Sundaran tk reveal the truth - he committed the murder of Thulasimani on the orders of his boss, the division manager Vijayabhanu (Suresh Krishna). Vijaybhanu was the husband of Thulasi's sister and fell madly in love with Thulasi. He approached her numerous times but was rejected by Thulsi. She threatened to disclose the approaches of Vijayabhanu to everyone and also secretly married her boyfriend Makarand from Mangaluru, which provoked Vijayabhanu to kill her before she reached home. However the most complicated case was that of Nadiya. She appeared to be brutally raped with teeth marks on her body and nerves to her brains being cut. Sharafuddeen goes behind Nadiya and finds that she along with her identical twin sister Nadira were orphans, and their father was Zakriya Mether, a goon and arms dealer, who was killed by a special team led by Sharafuddeen while he was posted in the'Q' Branch of Tamil Nadu Police years ago. The sisters were raised by eminent dancer Janaki Iyer at her academy in Kanjikode. Nadira grew up to be a professional dancer, while Nadiya became an acclaimed shooter, holding a grudge against Sharaufuddeen for killing her father before her eyes. Their foster mother Janaki died, leaving all her properties to the twin sisters which was now managed by Aadilakshmi (Urmila Unni), their manager and her brother Lakshman. Nadira's marriage was fixed with internationally acclaimed musician Zia Musafir, son of Janaki's discipline and loyalist Ustad Ghulam Musafir (Siddique). Ustad isn't happy with the investigation, and especially with the chief officer Sharafuddeen due to several reasons. While doctors confirmed that chances of Nadiya recovering from her coma are very less, Ustad even asks Nadira to sign consent paper for mercy killing of her sister, which she refuses. Sharafuddeen and team reach their academy and question Aadilakshmi and Lakshman. When Nadira arrives, Sharafuddeen reveals in front of her that Aadilakshmi was always after Janaki Iyer's family wealth which is now entitled to the twins. Sharafuddeen also reveals that the train made a technical stop for two and a half hours at Coimbatore station. The reason why Nadiya didn't travel to her academy which is just 35 minutes from Coimbatore station is unclear. While in her room, someone attacks Nadira from behind, and she runs away after biting hard on the attacker's hand. Sharafuddeen warns Nadira that even her life is at risk now. While the investigation continues, they discovered that Nadiya had called the Academy's phone number hours before being attacked. Connecting pieces, they find out that someone had used the Academy's official car and entered into Coimbatore station car park area. Upon following the evidences and tracing the path travelled by the car, the team reaches a pond in a rural area. Upon searching the pond thoroughly, they retrieve Nadiya's gun, ID proofs and other belongings. Sharafuddeen concludes that Lakshman attacked Nadiya, which Nadira opposes while talking to Sharafuddeen in private. Sharafudeen says that, if not Aadi Lakshmi's brother it has to be Zia Musafir who might have done this, by taking a break from his world tour, as he was not reportedly in Bahamas on the day Nadiya was stabbed and was in India as per Emigration records. Nadira refuses all claims and defends Zia. Sharafudden decides to take all the suspects and witnesses to Chennai to conduct a scientific Narco-analysis test along with Nadiya who is in a state of coma, by taking the same train. During the journey, seeing Nadira standing close to the door, Sharafuddeen confronts her. During the chat, Sharafuddeen reveals that amidst that engagement night, the academy's car was taken out and also reveals that it was Nadira who was in it. When Nadira disagrees with this, Sharafuddeen plays an audio evidence from Lakshman who spotted her that night. Finally Sharafuddeen reveals that she is indeed the one who stabbed her twin sister, which Nadira finally agrees. She says that she wanted to prevent Nadiya from selling the academy which was in her ownership. However, Sharafuddeen reveals one more shocking truth to the astonishment of 'Nadira' - that the one standing in front of him is Nadiya and not Nadira, thereby implying that the other girl unconsciously bound to a hospital bed is the real Nadira. Despite initially objecting Sharafuddeen's claim, Nadiya's identity is revealed due to her characteristic trait of getting nosebleed whenever she is nauseated. Sharafuddeen says that right upon retrieving the real Nadiya's gun, passport and other belongings, the blood group specification in her passport deceived Nadiya's fake identity because Nadira's blood samples from the crime spot were of a different group. It is also revealed that it was Sudarshan (Shammi Thilakan), Sharafuddeen's assistant and right hand man who attacked Nadiya in the dark earlier, for the purpose of getting a teeth bite sample from her which matched the bite marks on Nadira's lips. Finally, Sharafuddeen says that he concluded the real killer's identity when Nadiya got a nosebleed upon hearing bad comments about Zia (which Sharafuddeen made purposefully). The truth was that Nadiya - the shooter was deep in love with Zia, though he had affection only towards her identical twin sister Nadira - the dancer. Ustad fixes the marriage, without the consent of Nadiya and she was provoked to mad anger when Nadira boasted about Zia's love to her. She gets angry and decides to kill Nadira, by asking her to pick her up at Coimbatore Station. When Nadira arrived, Nadiya assaulted her and stabs behind her head to let her bleed to death. To appear as a rape, Nadiya even creates teeth-bites on Nadira's body and carefully switches her dress with Nadira's. She swapped her identity as Nadira, making the real Nadira collapse into a coma state. Soon after her confession to Sharafuddeen, she jumps out of the moving train and hits hard on to a railway signal thereby killing herself, which makes it the real night when Nadiya was killed. Months later, Zia (Prithviraj) returns and takes Nadira, who is in a coma state, to the US for advanced treatment hoping that she will recover. Cast *Suresh Gopi ...

In the 1980s, she re-emerged as an independent recording artist and vocal coach, later working in film and TV scoring and Hawaiian music. Biography=Early years Pamela Polland composed her first song at the age of nine and by her teens was playing folk clubs. During this period, she formed a two-year alliance with Ry Cooder who accompanied her for performances of blues material.‚ÄúPamela Polland & Ry Cooder Concert, Ash Grove (Los Angeles, CA),\\" Wolfgang's Vault Her recording career began a few years later, in 1966, when she and singer-songwriter Rick Stanley became The Gentle Soul,‚ÄúThe Gentle Soul ‚Äì Our National Anthem (1968),\\" A Bit Like You And Me a folk band with psychedelic influences and an emphasis on creative and elaborate vocal harmonies. Their self-titled album appeared on Epic Records together with a number of non-LP singles. Following the dissolution of The Gentle Soul, Pamela set up home in Mill Valley, California before joining Joe Cocker and Leon Russell for the Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour in 1970.‚ÄúPamela Polland with Mad Dogs and Englishmen,\\" YouTube She can be heard and seen in the ensuing double album and film documentary respectively. Songwriter and teacher Polland's songs have been recorded by a considerable number of popular artists from the 60s onwards. These include Helen Reddy, who recorded \\"Music, Music\\" for her gold-selling album of the same name in 1976, and Linda Ronstadt, who recorded \\"I'd Like To Know\\". Among the most widely recorded of her songs is \\"Tulsa County\\", which has been interpreted by The Byrds, Bobby Bare, Anita Carter, Jesse Ed Davis, and Son Volt. More recently, singer-songwriter Alela Diane recorded Polland's \\"See My Love\\" when she guested as a vocalist for The Headless Heroes' 2008 covers album, \\"The Silence of Love\\". The original version of \\"See My Love\\" appeared on \\"The Gentle Soul\\". By the 80s, Polland had also established herself as a vocal coach, and she later released the instructional DVD \\"Vocal Ease\\".‚ÄúVocal Ease,\\" Pamela Polland Solo artist Her emergence as a solo artist began with the self-written album \\"Pamela Polland\\", which appeared on Columbia Records in 1972. Owing to changes of personnel at Columbia, Polland's follow-up album, \\"Have You Heard The One About The Gas Station Attendant?\\" (1973), recorded in London with producer Gus Dudgeon and featuring guest appearances from Joan Armatrading, as well as several members of Elton John's band and renowned arranger Paul Buckmaster, was shelved. Her next solo album was not to be until 1995's \\"Heart of the World\\", which combined her pop and jazz leanings with New Age sensibilities. The album, produced by Gary Malkin (Graceful Passages), also sported guest spots from Kenny Loggins, Bonnie Raitt, The Byrds' Chris Hillman, as well as Mike Marshall and several other well recorded musicians. Public interest in the Epic/Columbia years was reawakened from 2003 onwards, when \\"The Gentle Soul\\" was reissued on CD in America. This was followed by Japanese reissues of \\"The Gentle Soul\\" as well as \\"Pamela Polland\\". Subsequently, both albums, along with \\"Heart Of The World\\", were made available on iTunes. The \\"Pamela Polland\\" album is also part of the Pandora internet radio library. The unreleased 1973 Columbia album, believed to be an artistic triumph, has been referred to by Polland as \\"some of my best work\\".Polland, Pamela. Interview.

Melba Rounds Pamela Polland as Melba Rounds The unfortunate events at Columbia Records that curtailed Polland's first solo career prompted a change of direction, and ‚Äì in the mid-seventies ‚Äì she resumed activities under the name Melba Rounds. The fictional Melba Rounds was a bawdy and lubricious blues and jazz madam whose repertoire spanned the 1920s to the 1940s. Polland's \\"Melba Rounds Show\\" proved a hit in San Francisco, and was noted for its exuberance, extravagant costumes and dancers.‚ÄúMelba Rounds Show Demo,\\" YouTube The Melba Rounds Show demonstrated the breadth of Polland's stylistic repertoire and spawned a ten-year stint for her as principal vocalist with The Golden Age jazz band. Hawaii Following the release of \\"Heart of The World\\", Polland's self-published third solo album, she moved to Maui, Hawaii, and threw herself into local culture and music. She took up the ‚Äòukulele, studied local language, and became a hula dancer. Polland is currently band leader of Keaolani,\\"Hula Lolo by Keaolani,\\" YouTube a four-piece ‚Äòukulele band tutored by Hawaiian cultural experts Kahauanu Lake and Walter Kamuala‚Äòi Kawai‚Äòae‚Äòa. She is also the co-founder of Maui Film Music, through which she provides film and TV scores with Bobby Parrs. Polland's achievements as an artist and performer in Hawaiian music are such that she was requested to appear at Tony Curtis's 81st birthday party as well as a command performance for Anthony Hopkins. In June 2010, Polland released \\"Hawaiianized\\", a five-track digital download EP available internationally via iTunes and other digital outlets. The mini-album, part one of an envisaged series, featured pop classics interpreted in Hawaiian style with new vocal arrangements and 'ukulele accompaniment from Polland. The collection was produced by John McFee of The Doobie Brothers, who had played on Polland's self-titled Columbia debut, and who also played a variety of acoustic and electric stringed instruments on the EP. The set's distinctive background vocals were sung by Sharon Celani, famous for her work with Stevie Nicks and others. \\"Hawaiianized\\" was bookended by two different versions of \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\", prompting Sam Arlen, son of the song's composer Harold Arlen, to comment, \\"This version of my father's classic composition lifts the spirit while still tugging at the heartstrings to remind us that there is really no place like home.

By default, RUSs are established by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) unless the latter objects within 60 days; and the ORR have confirmed no objection to the establishment of the Kent RUS. Uniquely, this RUS area encompasses the only dedicated very high-speed railway in the United Kingdom, the so-called High Speed 1 (HS1), over which domestic, as opposed to the established international, services started a few weeks prior to publication of the RUS. Some of the RUS's conclusions do involve this line. However the scope of the RUS concentrates mainly on the 'classic' lines, most of which date to the 19th century; as such it includes the London Bridge to Hastings line, via Orpington, Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, almost all lines east of that line, plus the main line via Swanley into London Victoria. Most services, including those via HS1, are run via the Southeastern franchise. Established plans will create significant changes in the classic network in the foreseeable future, especially those centred on the Thameslink Programme. The RUS identifies seven types of 'gap' and 16 groups of options to address these. In view of the prospective changes already in train, most initiative identified by the RUS are directed at Control Period 5 (CP5, April 2014-March 2019), though a few are detailed for Control Period 4 (CP4, to March 2014). Contingent projects=Thameslink Thameslink is the largest single programme affecting the RUS area, though in reality it comprises a significant number of related projects. The key objective is eventually to increase the frequency and length of the trains which pass between north and south London, and therefore has much wider scope than the KRUS area. It includes very major works at Blackfriars and Farringdon, currently under way as at March 2010, and at London Bridge and its environs, after the 2012 Olympic Games. It will largely separate train services through London Bridge to/from Charing Cross- bound from those to/from Blackfriars. This programme will cause a number of sequential recasts of services affecting the KRUS area. The programme is divided into three stages: * Key Output 0, complete * Key Output 1, 2009‚Äì2011 * Key Output 2, 2011/12-2016 The last stage will, following the Summer 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, encompass the wholesale redevelopment of London Bridge station and enhancement of its approaches at both ends. While the project will, upon completion, enhance capacity through London Bridge, during the works capacity will be restricted. At different stages during the work, a number of services to/from Charing Cross and Cannon Street stations will not be able to call at London Bridge. This will have implications widely throughout the KRUS area. Train lengthening under the Thameslink programme will affect a limited number of stations. New services from the KRUS area to north London via the Thameslink route may be possible at the conclusion of the programme, but would replace existing services in the KRUS area. In general, the works will have the greatest impact on suburban routes rather than the longer-distance routes featuring in the KRUS area. East Kent resignalling This is scheduled to commence in 2011 with remodelling of the track layout in the Faversham, Margate and Ramsgate areas. Later the route through the Medway towns will be remodelled. CP4 train lengthening The anticipated train lengthening will affect mostly the suburban services, but will indirectly affect the main-line services. Gaps and options The RUS summarises gaps in the following groups: * Gap A - between passenger demand and capacity in the peaks * Gap B - between passenger demand and capacity specifically within and close to Kent * Gap C - accessing the rail network * Gap D - between passenger demand in the evening/at weekends and services provided * Gap E - between demand and capacity for freight services * Gap F - achieving performance targets on an increasingly busy railway * Gap G - between future services on the Hastings route and currently envisaged services. Interventions to address these gaps are themselves divided into 16 options. Unless otherwise stated the peak-hour trains comprise those arriving in London between 7 and 10am (high peak between 8 and 9) and leaving between 4 and 7pm (high peak between 5 and 6); the hours on either side of the high peak are known as the shoulder peak. Gap A (peak demand and network capacity) and Options 1 through 6 Gap A concerns the danger of future overcrowding during the peak hours, and possible interventions to alleviate this problem. This issue manifests itself differently on various routes (Tonbridge line, route via Bromley South, and others). * Option 1 interventions attempting to allow additional services to run on the Tonbridge line; none recommended * Option 2 lengthening of all high peak trains to 12 cars on the Tonbridge line; implied in existing plans * Option 3 interventions attempting to allow additional services via Bromley South; one only (of three specific proposals) recommended * Option 4 lengthening of all high peak trains via Bromley South; those consistent with platform lengths recommended for further progress or study * Option 5 improved capacity in shoulder peaks; progressive lengthening recommended, but not extra services * Option 6 added peak capacity on HS1; selective extension of services further back into Kent recommended Gap B (aspiration for better off-peak services in/around Kent) and Options 7 through 9 Gap B concerns the relatively poor connections within Kent and to adjacent non-London destinations. * Option 7 increasing services per hour on several routes; none recommended (over those already committed) in the short or medium term * Option 8 providing new services; none recommended, except the possibility of international services to France * Option 9 reducing journey times by line speed increases and reviewing station calls: recommended for further study Gap C (improving access to the network) and Options 10 and 11 * Option 10 ** improving access to stations, via bus, car, bike and foot; all recommended ** relocation of Rochester station; recommended for feasibility in conjunction with future scheduled resignalling * Option 11 creating new stations; 4 (out of six) specific possibilities recommended for further consideration Gap D (handling demand during times of engineering access) and Option 12 * Option 12 progress seven-day railway initiatives; recommended in respect of Tonbridge and Chatham main Lines Gap E (freight capability) and Options 13 and 14 * Option 13 handle international freight demand; no recommendations beyond prospective use of HS1, and Redhill diversionary route * Option 14 provide adequate freight capability for Thames Gateway; various initiatives to be pursued in the appropriate time scale Gap F (performance) and Option 15 * Option 15 reconcile increase in traffic with need to improve performance; anticipated schemes (East Kent resignalling and doubling Tanners Hill flydown) recommended, but not possible to recommend other infrastructure changes on performance grounds alone Gap G (Hastings line service) and Option 16 * Option 16 retain existing level of service to/from Hastings, after completion of Thameslink; the sole initiative recommended is to attach/detach fast and slow services to/from Charing Cross in the peak at Tunbridge Wells The longer term The main recommendations of the KRUS cover the period to the 2020, just after the end of CP5. Further developments are envisaged later, but at this stage only very much in outline. A continued increase in passenger numbers, especially at peak times and particularly on the Thames Gateway, Medway and Tonbridge routes are anticipated. After the CP4 and CP5 interventions, there will be very limited opportunities to expand capacity on the existing network. Two possible major developments are identified: * an extension of Crossrail to Gravesend, providing an alternative from north Kent to routes into existing London terminals * the taking over of the Hayes branch by some other type of service; two possibilities are ** integrating the line into the Docklands Light Railway network ** the extension of the Bakerloo line to Lewisham, taking over the Hayes line from there References Category:Network Rail ","title":"Kent Route Utilisation Strategy"},{"id":"26588846","text":"This is a list of the seasons completed by the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball.

It is located in the southeast of the krai and borders with Boguchansky District in the north, Irkutsk Oblast in the east, Nizhneingashsky District in the southeast, Ilansky District in the south, Kansky District in the southwest, Dzerzhinsky District in the west, and with Taseyevsky District in the west and northwest. The area of the district is .Official website of Krasnoyarsk Krai. Information about Abansky Municipal District Its administrative center is the rural locality (a settlement) of Aban. Population: 26,783 (2002 Census); Geography The district lies between the forest steppe and taiga zones. It stretches for from west to east and for from north to south. History The district was founded on April 4, 1924. Abansky District is characterized by a diversity of its population. Many people voluntarily migrated to this area, but some were exiled here as well. During the 18th‚Äì19th centuries, the region was a common destination for exiled insurgents and revolutionaries, including Poles and the Decembrists. Most, however, migrated here voluntarily in the beginning of the 20th century, after the revolutionary events of 1905 and as a result of the agrarian reforms by Pyotr Stolypin. Migrants typically traveled by rail and arrived in big groups to Kansk. From there, they transported by horses to Aban. The majority of the farms and villages in the area appeared in the first two or three decades of the 20th century. Various ethnic groups tended to stick together for the reasons of common language, traditions, customs, and religious beliefs. This led to the establishment of villages populated mostly by the members of a single ethnic group; for example, Sterlitamak was predominantly Tatar, Vostok was a village of the Chuvash people, while Vorobyovka was populated by the Mordvins. The second wave of migrants rushed in during the late 1920s, as the area was subject to collectivization on a lesser scale than other regions of the country. New migrants usually moved with their fellow countrymen who had already been well- settled in the area and were able to provide the newcomers with support and assistance. The aspiration to \\"stick together\\" further strengthened and unified already tight ethnic communities. Even after settling in, people continued to speak their native language and maintained their customs and traditions, passing them on to the new generations. However, they also had to master Russian, as it was the language of communication between various ethnic groups and the language of the government. Various ethnic communities lived in peace and friendship, respecting each other's customs and sharing the best practices and experiences. Eventually, over time, the cultures blended together, creating a group which is now described by the term \\"Siberians\\". After World War II, many people exiled here started families; many remained to live and work in the district. In the 1960s, Aban became a destination for people exiled from the big cities under the \\"Decree of 1961\\"‚Äîpeople were sent here for their religious beliefs, for drunkenness, and for parasitism. As a result, the social composition of the population changed significantly. While the 1930s‚Äì1940s saw an influx of educated people and intellectuals sent here for political reasons, a significant portion of the exiles of the 1960s consisted of the people genuinely unwilling to work and \\"re-educated\\" by means of forcing them to work on forest plots. Five commandants were assigned to Abansky District to oversee the forced labor. The villages of Machino, Tagashi, Noshino, and Beryozovka housed Germans who were deported here after the end of World War II. The deported Germans were required to register with the local commandant twice a month and were prohibited from leaving their assigned residences. Many Germans were separated from their families, and only in the 1980s they were allowed to leave. Economy Kansk‚ÄìAban auto route Agriculture and forestry, at 55.6%, comprise the largest share of the district's economy, followed by the wholesale and retail trade and auto maintenance (18%). Abansky District is one of the top agricultural districts in the krai in terms of production volume. The district specializes in grain crops and their processing. Animal husbandry specializes in pig- and cattle- breeding. The district is rich in timber and coal reserves.Krasnoyarsk Krai Coal Geography (Coal) Education Fifty-seven educational facilities are located in the district: *11 pre-school facilities *43 secondary schools *1 inter-school educational-industrial complex *2 continuous education establishments for children Thirty-four per cent of children between ages one and eleven are covered by the pre-school educational system. Public health services There are three hospitals with the total of 211 beds in the district, in addition to 4 clinics. There are on average 14.3 doctors per 10,000 people and 7.7 medical workers per 1,000 people. Medicinal Lake Plakhino (Borovoye) is located in the district.
