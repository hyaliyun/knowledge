Recruited in the Borough of Camberwell, South London, the units served with the 'Pals battalions' of the 33rd Division on the Western Front for three years. They also supported other formations when 33rd Division was out of the line. The batteries saw action at the Somme, Arras, and Ypres, suffering heavy casualties. They were particularly distinguished defending against the German Spring Offensive of 1918, and continued through the victorious Allied Hundred Days Offensive. Background On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly- appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914, many of the units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.See, for example, Middlebrook, Somme, pp. 9–11; Bilton, pp. 22–40; Inglis, pp. 13–6; Jackson, pp. 14–7. The six K5 divisions were to be numbered 37th to 42nd, but the War Office (WO) then decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1–K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 40th Division thus became 33rd Division.Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix 2. The division's original infantry units were Pals battalions raised by London regiments (particularly the Public Schools Battalions and Sportsmen's Battalions), and the Royal Artillery (RA) brigades were raised in Camberwell, South London.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 31–9. Recruitment On 14 January 1915 the WO authorised Major Frederick Hall, MP for Dulwich, and the Mayor of Camberwell to raise a brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), to be numbered CLVI (156th). The local response was so prompt that in March another brigade was raised, numbered CLXII (162nd). The WO was then told that there were still enough would-be recruits in the Camberwell neighbourhood to raise the whole artillery for an infantry division. At once, authority was given to recruit the two remaining RFA brigades, CLXVI (166th Bde) and CLXVII (H) (167th Howitzer Bde), the 126th Heavy Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and the Divisional Ammunition Column (DAC). Major Hall himself was the first commanding officer (CO) of CLVI Bde. All the men came from Camberwell and nearby Dulwich, and the units were complete by 1 June:Frederick, pp. 551–2.Frederick, pp. 699–701.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 1–2.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 3.Brian Green, 'Dulwich During World War I', Dulwich Society.The authorisations by the War Office were actually issued on 3 February (156th), 2 March (167th) and 17 April (remainder): War Office Instructions July 1915, Appendix VI.33rd DA at Long, Long Trail.

Training 15-pounder gun issued for training. 33rd Divisional Artillery trained at the Grove Vale Depot in East Dulwich, while specialists were sent for courses to the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich, St John's Wood Barracks and Larkhill Camp. At first there were no uniforms and they only had three obsolete 15-pounder guns and dummy loaders with which to learn the rudiments of gunnery. The men of CLVI Bde and the DAC lived at home, CLXII Bde was housed at Gordon's Brewery, CLXVI Bde at the Tramway Depot at Peckham, and CLXVII (H) Bde partly at home and partly at Dulwich Public Baths.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 2–3. In July 1915 the 33rd Division began to assemble at Clipstone Camp, Nottinghamshire, but the artillery remained at Camberwell where four modern 18-pounder field guns arrived, together with the first 4.5-inch howitzer for CLXVII (H) Bde. In August the division moved to Salisbury Plain for final battle training, the artillery arriving at Bulford Camp between 5 and 10 August.Macartney-Filgate, p. 4. The units were formally taken over by the military authorities on 12 August.War Office Instructions September 1915, Appendix VII. On 4 November the 33rd Division was ordered to prepare to embark for France. However, gunners required longer training, so the division's infantry joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France with the divisional artillery of the 54th (East Anglian) Division of the Territorial Force (TF) temporarily attached.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 125–31. Orders for 33rd DA to proceed to France were received on 6 December, and the batteries began to entrain at Amesbury for Southampton, 51 trains in all being required to move the batteries and ammunition columns.Macartney-Filgate, p. 5. Western Front 18-Pounder field gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. 4.5-inch Howitzer at the Royal Artillery Museum. 33rd Divisional Artillery (less 126th Heavy Battery) embarked at Southampton on 12–13 December 1915, and concentrated at Aire and Thiennes on 16 December to rejoin their division. 54th Divisional Artillery left on 12 December and embarked at Marseille to join their own division in Egypt.Macartney-Filgate, p. 7. Each brigade of 33rd DA sent successive parties up to the line to be attached to the artillery of 2nd Division so that between 18 December and 11 January 1916 all the personnel received four days' experience with a front line battery. From mid-January the batteries began to relieve those of 2nd and 12th (Eastern) Division for six- day spells, continuing their training when not in the line. C/CLXVII (H) Battery went into the line in its own right on 30 December, attached to I Corps' Heavy Artillery for Counter-battery (CB) duties. A/CLXII and A/CLXVI Batteries joined it on 13 February, before the whole of 33rd DA took over the sector from 12th DA between 23 and 25 February, while 33rd Division's infantry relieved 12th Division. As the units he had raised began to move into the line, Lt-Col Hall handed over command of CLVI Bde to a permanent officer and returned to Parliament; he was later knighted (KBE) and awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his efforts.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 8–11.London Gazette, 28 December 1917.London Gazette, 7 January 1918. The line held by the division was on the La Bassée front from 'Mad Point' to Givenchy, just north of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, scene of bitter fighting the previous autumn, but now considered a 'quiet' sector suitable for newly-arrived formations. But there was active Tunnel warfare in this sector, leading to further actions at the Hohenzollern Redoubt. The divisional artillery had to be prepared to put down an 'SOS barrage' at any time when a mine was exploded followed by an infantry raid. On 27 April a German mine was fired and 33rd Division was attacked with heavy gas shelling. Following this attack the batteries were subjected to several days of CB fire.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 11–7. On 22 June a German mine near Givenchy required every available gun to fire SOS missions. On 27 June a British trench raid at Mad Point was covered by a Box barrage fired by the divisional artillery. Further raids were carried out on 2 and 5 July as diversions from the Somme Offensive further south.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 20–1. Reorganisation On 14 February, B (H) Battery and a subsection of the BAC were transferred from CLXVII (H) Brigade to 1/IV London (H) Brigade in the 56th (1st London) Division (TF).Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141–47. Then in May the field artillery of the BEF was reorganised so that howitzer batteries were distributed among the brigades of 18-pounders. All three remaining batteries of CLXVII (H) Brigade were therefore sent to the other brigades of the division, to be designated D (H) Battery in each case. In exchange, CLXVII received an 18-pounder battery from each of the other brigades, The three former D batteries became A/ B/ and C/CLXVII Batteries. The BACs were also abolished and merged into the DAC, which was reorganised as a headquarters and four sections.Farndale, Annex D, pp. 348–54.Macartney- Filgate, pp. 17–9.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 14. In January, the division's infantry brigades had formed light trench mortarFarndale, Annex G. batteries (TMBs). Now a brigade of medium and heavy trench mortars was formed by the divisional artillery (although in most divisions around half the men came from the infantry): X/33, Y/33 and Z/33 Medium TMBs (each equipped with four 2-inch Medium Mortars) by 4 May, and V/33 Heavy TMB (9.45-inch Heavy Mortars) by 29 May. Battle of the Somme 18-Pounder in action on the Somme, August 1916. After five months of familiarisation with trench warfare on the Western Front, the 33rd Division saw its first fullscale operations during the Somme Offensive as part of XV Corps. It began to move south by train on 10 July and was in Corps Reserve during the Battle of Albert (12–13 July) before being committed to action during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge on 14 July. CLXII and CXLVI Brigades deployed in Caterpillar Valley largely without incident, though D (H)/CLXII Battery deployed in the wrong position and its guns and teams came under heavy shellfire, losing a number of casualties. The infantry of XV Corps took most of their objectives on 14 July, but High Wood and Delville Wood remained in enemy hands. 33rd Division renewed the attack the following day, supported by its own two brigades bombarding Switch Trench west of High Wood for an hour before moving the barrage on to Martinpuich while the infantry assaulted Switch Trench. But Switch Trench was almost completely hidden from the artillery's Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) and the attack was a failure, the infantry returning to their starting positions.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 21–9.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 36, 84, 95–6.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 16–8. The gunners now dug in and camouflaged the positions they had taken up the previous day. They were joined by the other two brigades during the night of 15/16 July, and some batteries moved to less exposed positions. For five days 33rd DA was able to set up observation posts (OPs) and register targets before the next Attacks on High Wood planned for 20 July. 33rd Divisional Artillery suffered badly from German CB fire on 19 July, sustaining numerous casualties from gas and Shrapnel shells. XV Corps began its bombardment of High Wood at 02.55 on 20 July, with 2000 rounds of 18-pounder and 500 rounds of 4.5-inch ammunition fired by each brigade. The infantry went 'over the top' at Zero (03.25) when the guns lifted to a new barrage line for a further half hour, before lifting to the final barrage line at the far side of the wood. Although the wood was carried and a German counter-attack was broken up by artillery and rifle fire, the hostile artillery fire eventually drove the British infantry back to the southern half of the wood. For two days the artillery duel continued, 33rd DA suffering numerous casualties in men and guns. Although the infantry of 33rd Division were relieved on 21 July the artillery remained in the line under the command of 51st (Highland) Division which renewed the assault on 23 July. This was another failure. Despite a lull in the infantry fighting from 23 to 27 July, the artillery continued to fire under XV Corps' command at the rate of 2000 rounds per brigade by day and 700 by night. The guns' recoil springs began to fail, so that by 26 July CLXII Bde only had five guns in action, two of them only partially serviceable.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 28–36.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 106, footnote; 109–13.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 18. On 27 July, 33rd DA supported a new attack by 5th Division between High Wood and Delville Wood, important because it was an early example of a Creeping barrage. A storm of artillery fire heralded the new attack, and fighting continued all day, climaxing at 18.00 when a heavy counter-attack came in, which was broken up by the British artillery, as was another the following night. Casualties among 33rd DA's batteries were, however, heavy, with several guns completely destroyed and a number of gun detachments wiped out. 33rd Divisional Artillery supported attacks by several formations during the Delville Wood fighting until 1 August, when CLXII and CLXVI Bdes were relieved by 17th (Northern) Divisional Artillery. Unfortunately, the relief was carried out under German air observation and the gun teams were heavily shelled. CLVI and CLXVII Bdes remained in the line under the command of 51st (H) Division until they were withdrawn, exhausted, on 11 August, and relieved by CLXII and CLXVI Bdes returning. These two brigades now took up positions around Caterpillar Valley, supporting 33rd Division, whose infantry had also returned. Although there was a lull in the infantry fighting, the artillery duels continued with CB shoots, minor bombardments, and hundreds of shells were fired by day and night to 'search' the enemy's roads and dead ground. Wireless sets were now available, and the howitzers were available to respond to urgent calls from artillery observation aircraft.Farndale, p. 150.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 36–41.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 157–8. Orders arrived on 16 August for the next divisional attack to be delivered on 'Wood Lane' trench two days later. The artillery ammunition allotted for night firing was doubled, while by day the guns engaged in wire-cutting, shelling Wood Lane, and 'searching' No man's land to drive German machine-gunners out of the shell holes. On the morning of 18 August the 18-pounders laid a barrage on Wood Lane, and three times lifted to suggest an impending attack; the 4.5s then dropped back onto the trench in an effort to catch any enemy troops who had manned the parapet. 33rd Division launched its attack at 14.45, but 4th Battalion King's (Liverpool Regiment) on the left, despite following the barrage so closely as to have 'walked right into [it]', were stopped by German machine gun teams who had succeeded in maintaining themselves in No man's land, and it never reached Wood Lane. This failure exposed the right flank of the 14th (Light) Division and the left flank of 1/4th Suffolk Regiment of the 33rd, and the assault failed. The guns then shortened their range to lay down a protective barrage.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 41–2.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 191 footnote; 193–5.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 20–1. 33rd Division then went to rest, but 33rd DA remained in the line, side- slipping to the right, which entailed re-registering the targets in their zone. The horse teams worked day and night to replenish the ammunition from 'Green Dump', coming up the 'Valley of Death' under continuous gas and shell attacks. On 22 August Lt-Col Harris commanding CLXII Bde was ordered to reconnoitre a position for a forward gun to enfilade the new German trench running north-east from Wood Lane, and Lt V. Benett-Sandford with a gun of C Bty registered on the trench at a range of . After rest, the division returned on 24 August for a more successful attack on High Wood. The divisional artillery was incorporated into a corps fireplan, with CLVI Bde supporting 7th Division, while CLXII and CLXVI supported 14th (L) Division. The bombardment began at 03.45, CLXII Bde sweeping the previously-registered Wood Lane in enfilade from 05.45. Zero was at 06.45, when the 18-pdrs began a creeping barrage and the 4.5s lengthened range to bombard the Flers-Longueval road. From his OP near Longueval, Lt-Col Harris was able to send situation reports back to 33rd Divisional HQ, allowing the commander to deal quickly with situations as they arose. The attack was very successful for the division, with 100th Bde finally capturing Wood Trench.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 42–5.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 197–202.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 21. German retaliation came on 25 August, when every battery position was bombarded throughout the day with shells of all calibres. This disrupted ammunition resupply, and some detachments had to be withdrawn from the guns due to heavy casualties. The 18-pdr battery positions of CLXII Bde, 'churned from end to end, were rendered quite uninhabitable, and during that night and the following day new positions were taken up'. CLVI Brigade also moved, but for tactical reasons, so that it could bombard Ginchy. The other brigades' target zones were also moved onto Delville Wood. The ammunition waggons struggled to resupply the guns in the mud. The weather was so bad that the attack on Ginchy was cancelled, which allowed the batteries to drain their positions and dig in properly. 33rd Divisional Artillery remained in position even after the division's infantry were relieved, and supported 24th Division against fierce German counter-attacks on 30 and 31 August. The bombardment for the next attack was due to begin on 2 September, but on the night of 31 August/1 September the positions of CLVI and CLXVII brigades were drenched with gas shells; B/CLXVII Bty suffered so many casualties that it had to be replaced by C Bty from divisional reserve. The bombardment on 2 and 3 September was followed by 1st and 24th Divisions' attack at noon on 3 September, when every gun and howitzer was in action. Delvill Wood was cleared, but there was a reverse in High Wood followed by a German counter-attack, Immediately, nine guns of CLXII Bde were switched to break up this attack, but the Germans halted along the skyline and did not cross it. No other guns were brought to bear on them, and they held the ground they had retaken. 33rd Divisional Artillery was relieved on 5 September after 8 weeks' continuous action and moved to the Arras sector.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 45–51.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 202–7. Further reorganisations Another reorganisation of the BEF's divisional artillery was carried out in September 1916, when the 18-pounder batteries were brought up to a strength of six guns each. In 33rd Division this was done by breaking up CLXVII Bde and transferring a section (half battery) to each of the batteries of CLIV and CLXII, while C/CLXVI was split up between A/ and B/CLXVI (Lt-Col C.G. Stewart of CLXVII Bde took command of CLXVI). The process was completed in January 1917 when CLXVI Bde was broken up, sections of D (H) bringing the other brigades' howitzer batteries up to six guns. A/ and B/CLXVI Batteries were transferred to XXVI and XCIII Army Field Artillery Brigades respectively. CLXVI's brigade HQ exchanged with CLVI, whose staff left, so that Lt-Col Stewart now commanded CLVI. The resulting organisation was as follows:Farndale, Annex M, p. 391.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 52–4, 63, 69, 73.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 23; however, Seton-Hutchinson omits V/33 Heavy TMB. 33rd Divisional Artillery * CLVI (Camberwell) Brigade (A, B, C and D (H) Btys) * CLXII (Camberwell) Brigade (A, B, C and D (H) Btys) * 33rd Divisional Ammunition Column * 33rd Divisional Trench Mortar Brigade ** V/33 Heavy Trench Mortar Bty ** X/33, Y/33 and Z/33 Medium Trench Mortar Btys Battle of the Ancre While 33rd Division remained at rest, its artillery returned to the Somme. The staff work at corps level was poor, and 33rd DA spent the last weeks of September marching and counter-marching from one position to another. Finally the batteries were in position under command of 49th (West Riding) Division to prepare for the final stage of the Somme Offensive, the Battle of the Ancre. From 7 to 11 October the guns were engaged in wire-cutting, then 33rd DA sideslipped to cut wire in front of 31st Division. This continued from 20 October to 13 November (the attack being postponed several times because of mud), with occasional bursts of fire to stop the wire being repaired, and bombardments of enemy communication trenches. These obvious preparations drew heavy CB fire from the Germans, with thousands of gas shells arriving nightly on the battery positions, forcing the gunners to wear respirators while serving their guns. The intensity of the bombardment was increased from 10 November to Zero hour (05.45) on 13 November. Although 31st Division's infantry found the wire successfully cut and advanced through to their second objective behind regular list of the field gun barrage, mud prevented the neighbouring division from crossing no man's land leaving 31st with an open flank. The Hull Pals of 92nd Bde actually got so far forward that they came under fire from their own guns. The captured ground had to be abandoned that evening and 31st Division withdrew in the evening covered by a protective barrage from 33rd DA. The offensive continued further south and 33rd DA fired a dummy barrage on 14 November to assist this before withdrawing from the fighting line.Bilton, pp. 146–70.Horsfall and Cave, pp. 75–88.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 476–7, 499–501.Macarney-Filgate, pp. 54–61. Winter 1916–17 33rd Divisional Artillery spent the following weeks overhauling equipment and training , particularly the newly-arrived reinforcements. On 5 December the batteries began the move to the extreme right of the British front, where 33rd and 40th Divisions were to take over positions from the French Army and then alternate. Each division would have two artillery brigades in the line and one in reserve. Almost all the batteries were in position in the Maurepas–Bouchavesnes area by 16 December, where they converted the French gun pits and communications; in practice the batteries reverted to four-gun establishments to take over four-gun positions until new platforms could be erected in the mud. They were pulled out of these positions for rest in mid-January 1917, then returned at the end of the month to take over yet another section from the French, this time straddling the River Somme with a gap filled with marshes between the two groups. Battery positions were difficult to find, because the whole sector was under German observation. When the marsh froze over and German raids were feared, the ice was broken by howitzer fire. Harassing fire by German Minenwerfers were replied to by X, Y and Z/33 medium TMBs. Enfilade sections were established to take advantage of bends in the river. More active operations recommenced in February, with wire-cutting and trench bombardments to simulate attacks, and covering fire for actual trench raids. On 9 March, 33rd DA was relieved and moved north in bad weather to the train for the Arras Offensive.Macarney- Filgate, pp. 62–78.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 29–32. On 21 March 1917, Lt-Col C.G. Stewart, who had commanded three successive brigades of 33rd DA, was promoted to Brigadier-General as Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) of the division.Macartney-Filgate, p. 77. Battle of Arras Re-positioning an 18-pounder during the advance near Athies during the First Battle of the Scarpe. For the forthcoming attack, 33rd DA was responsible for the zone immediately south of the River Scarpe, and after taking part in the preliminary bombardment was to advance in support of the assaulting infantry of 15th (Scottish) Division. OPs were established in some tall factory chimneys on the east side of Arras (with telephone lines running through the town's sewers for protection from shellfire) and the first guns came into action on 30/31 March to begin wire-cutting. The planned five-day bombardment began on 4 April (it was actually extended to six days when the attack was postponed to 9 April) with the biggest and most complex fireplan yet seen. One day was devoted to destroying positions in woods, another to trench junctions, and a third to villages and cross-roads, while the enemy front and support trenches and wire were kept under constant bombardment day and night. Retaliatory fire from the Germans was light, but did cause some casualties on the gun positions. Meanwhile the routes forward were marked with coloured flags and the waggon lines were brought up for the advance behind the infantry. The 18-pdrs and 4.5s were supplied with 300 rounds per gun per day, the 2-inch mortars with 120 and the 9.45s with 50, the mortars assisting with short-range wire-cutting. 8 April, the original day planned for the attack, gave perfect visibility, allowing the FOOs to spot and concentrate on untouched wire. During the night of 8/9 April the batteries shelled the enemy gun positions with gas, then at 05.30 on 9 April the guns began firing the protective barrage as the infantry advanced. The 18-pdrs fired a creeping barrage (50 per cent Shrapnel, 50 per cent HE), while the 4.5s fired a standing barrage on the enemy front line. The German forward positions (the Black Line) were quickly overrun, the infantry pausing to reorganise behind the barrage, then advancing again at 07.30 towards the more strongly-held Blue Line beyond Railway Triangle through Athies and along Observatory Ridge. The infantry were accompanied by FOOs from their supporting batteries. Railway Triangle proved a serious obstacle, and the creeping barrage outpaced the infantry, but the FOOs saw this and the barrage was brought back to fall on the railway embankment, eliminating the defenders. Meanwhile two companies of 12th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, had continued on towards the Blue Line, but realising that they were now ahead of the resumed barrage, coolly took cover and let it pass over them, then followed close behind it. As soon as the Blue Line was secured 33rd DA's batteries began to move up, one section at a time, to prepared positions at Blangy, just behind the British start line, from which they continued the barrage to the third objective (Orange Hill on the Brown Line). All the guns had to pass through narrow streets and cross a single bridge to get to these positions, and it had been feared that German shellfire would have prevented the move, but little was received. By mid-afternoon CCLXII Bde was moving forward again, this time to Railway Triangle. But now it began to snow, and the churned-up battlefield turned to mud as the gun teams struggled forward, the crews manhandling the guns across unbridged trenches. However, they were in position before dawn on 10 April.Falls, 1917, Vol I, pp. 179–86, 222–5.Farndale, pp. 165–8.Macartney- Filgate, pp. 80–7. There was little fighting on 10 April, while the infantry reorganised and the artillery struggle out of the bog east of Railway Triangle back to the outskirts of Arras, then moved up towards Monchy-le-Preux along the Cambrai road, despite fearful congestion. Next day 33rd DA supported 37th Division's successful attack on Monchy, but the attacks on 12 April failed in the face of increased German artillery. 33rd DA's batteries and waggon lines came under heavy fire and the horse teams had to be withdrawn, leaving only a few at Railway Triangle for pack duties. On 14 April a German counter-attack on Monchy was broken up by the field batteries. 33rd DA then continued harassing fire under 17th (N) Division until 23 April. 17th Division attacked on 23 and 24 April, then 12th (E) Division on 28 April, before the next great effort of the Arras offensive (the Second Battle of the Scarpe) on 4 May. During this attack the howitzer batteries were called upon to bombard the stubbornly-held Scabbard Trench while the British infantry were lying only yards away. The accurate HE did great execution and when the enemy troops broke cover they were caught by the 18-pdrs. After another lull, 4th Division captured the Roeux chemical works on 11–12 April, and 12th Division attempted to take Devil's Tench, both advances being supported by 33rd DA. On 14 May 33rd DA fired a 'Chinese' (dummy) barrage towards Devil's Trench and then bombarded it heavily to catch any defenders who showed themselves. But while the British infantry were reorganising, the German's concentrated on the artillery and the batteries' casualties rose steadily under CB fire directed by air observers. On 16 May the chemical works was lost and a new attack on Devil's Trench was launched on 19 May. The night before, D (H)/CLXII Bty ran a single gun up to Chinstrap Lane in the hope that its enfilade fire would assist the attack, but the infantry were defeated by machine gun fire. Minor attacks and Chinese barrages continued until 14 June, when 3rd Division captured Infantry Hill behind a barrage fired by 33rd DA, and two German counter-attacks on 17 June were smashed by the field guns. On 20 June 33rd DA was finally withdrawn from the Arras sector after three months' action. Because CLXII brigade had always been the furthest forward, the Commander-in- Chief, Sir Douglas Haig awarded it the unusual distinction of presenting a captured 5.9-inch German howitzer.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 87–99. Between April and June it had supported nine separate divisions. 33rd Division had joined in the Second Battle of the Scarpe, and suffered severely due to mistakes by its unfamiliar supporting artillery. From 12 May the CRA, Brig-Gen Stewart controlled the artillery supporting 33rd Division while his brigades were under the CRAs of the divisions to which they were attached.Farndale, p. 177.Macartney-Filgate, Appendix II.Macartney-Filgate, p. 102.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 34–8. Flanders coast The batteries moved south and took up positions at Hénin-sur-Cojeul facing the Hindenburg Line. For the first time since February, 33rd DA was supporting troops of its own division. In early July, however, the division was transferred to the Flanders coast, the withdrawal of the guns on the night of 11/12 July being accompanied by German shellfire. Training was carried out behind the lines until the batteries entrained on 24 July and took up positions in the sand dunes near Dunkirk, on the extreme left of the whole Western Front. Here Fourth Army was intended to make an amphibious assault behind the enemy lines and advance up the coast in conjunction with the BEF's Flanders offensive (the Third Battle of Ypres). In the meantime the massed artillery duelled with the German guns, suffering casualties through the summer. By the end of August it was clear that the BEF was not going to achieve a clean breakthrough, and the units on the coast began to be sent to the Ypres Salient to reinforce the offensive there. 33rd Divisional Artillery pulled back to its waggon lines on the night of 27/28 August and spent two days there, suffering serious casualties to the DAC from long-range guns, before marching south on 1 September to join Second Army.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 100–111.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 62–4. Third Battle of Ypres 18-pounder being hauled out of mud at Zillebeke, 1917. The first sections of CLVI Bde relieved CCLXXXVIII Army Field Bde on the night of 5/6 September, the remainder moving in over the next two nights. CLXII Brigade was not relieving another unit, but had to prepare its own gun positions in the mud under shellfire. The working parties were reinforced by men from the DAC and TMBs; Lt-Col Arthur Johnson, commanding the DAC, was killed at Zillebeke on 17 September.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 195, 200.Johnson at CWGC. The brigades were supporting 23rd and 24th Divisions near Zillebeke, and on 15 September the bombardment began for the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 20 September. The terrain was featureless, but most batteries of 33rd DA were able to register their guns on the ruins of Gheluvelt Mill. Because of the mud, it was realised that the infantry could only advance slowly, so the creeping barrage was adjusted accordingly, with practice barrages fired twice a day before the attack. The battle was a notable artillery victory, the creeping barrage described as 'magnificent both in accuracy and volume',. However, casualties among the gunners from German CB fire were heavy, particularly in the minutes before Zero hour, and the guns had to be served at high intensity all day because of the slowness of the advance. 23rd Division took all three of its objective lines, the creeping barrage helping the men onto the third, where the heaviest resistance was encountered. Afterwards the guns fired a protective barrage while the infantry consolidated, and SOS barrages to break up German counter-attacks. By the end of the day every battery had suffered guns put out of action by enemy fire and ammunition dumps exploded, and the next two days were spent hauling up replacement guns from the Corps pool, and replenishing ammunition by means of pack horses.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 239–42, 247–8, 253–6, 258–60.Farndale, pp. 205–8.Lee, pp. 219–20.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 112–21.Wolff, pp. 187–95. The new style of attack pioneered by Second Army on the Menin Road was to be repeated at intervals of six days. 33rd Division's infantry relieved 23rd Division on the night of 24/25 September, and Brig-Gen Stewart took command of the artillery in the sector. The next attack, the Battle of Polygon Wood was due on 26 September, but early on 25 September, while the relief was being completed, a surprise counter-attack was launched by the Germans, driving 98th Bde and part of 100th Bde back to their support line, despite the SOS barrage being fired. A second attack mid-morning was stopped by the SOS barrage, but when the British artillery fired a practice barrage the Germans responded with devastating CB fire. A further artillery duel accompanied an SOS barrage late in the afternoon. These exchanges set back preparations for the next day's attack, which was held up on 33rd Division's front. The lost trench was recaptured, followed by the first objective, but the infantry could not get beyond it and at 12.15 the batteries were ordered to fire a protective barrage. A severe German shell storm and counter-attack came in mid-afternoon. It was not until the next day that 33rd Division worked its way forward to the final objective. By now the gun detachments were exhausted and weakened by casualties. A/CLVI Battery lost 13 guns in four days and 21 men, including nine gun No 1s, and the other batteries suffered similarly. B/CLXII Battery had to be relieved on 27 September, and the other batteries were only kept in action by men brought up from the DAC and the TM batteries; most guns had only one qualified gun-layer remaining.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 281–3, 286–7, 291–3.Farndale, pp. 208–10.Lee, p. 220.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 121–5.Wolff, pp. 195–9.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 66–73. On 28 September 33rd Division and the CRA were withdrawn, but the two brigades of 33rd DA remained in the line under the command of 23rd Division – a practice barrage coinciding with and breaking a German counter-attack. The brigades supported 5th Division for the next phase of the offensive, the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October. The objectives were strictly limited, but as before the guns 'shot' the infantry forward, and the German infantry and artillery were severely handled. The creeping barrage had advanced to the extreme range of the 18-pdrs to catch more Germans before dropping back to provide a protective barrage for the consolidating British infantry, breaking up eight counter-attacks in the afternoon and evening.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 314–5.Farndale, pp. 210–1.Lee, pp. 220–1.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 125–9.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 75.Wolff, pp. 207–8. Conditions for the artillery in the Ypres Salient were now very bad: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and suffered badly from counter-battery fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire. Nevertheless B/CLXII Bty came up again and the gun detachments did their best to reconstruct their gun positions, haul up ammunition and register for the next attack (the Battle of Poelcappelle) on 9 October, when 5th Division attempted to clear the Polderhoek Spur. But many of the shells were misdirected because of unstable gun platforms, while many landing in mud were ineffective. The infantry lost direction in the sea of shell holes, lost the barrage, and achieved nothing at the cost of heavy casualties.Farndale, p. 211.Lee, p. 221.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 129–31.Wolff pp. 222–35. Over the following days 33rd DA's batteries were rotated between the gun lines and the waggon lines, where they could get some rest, and by 24 October all were back in the line except C/CLXII, which had been worst hit. For the attack of 26 October (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), CLXII Bde HQ took command of 'C' Group at Bedford House supporting 20th Bde of 7th Division; the group included A and D (H)/CLXII, B and C/CLVI, and three Australian batteries. D (H)/CLXII Battery was shelled out of its position at Maple Cross and relocated to Zouave Wood. The other batteries of 33rd DA were in 'B' Group supporting 91st Bde of 7th Division. The bad weather continued and the mud worsened, but at 05.40 the barrage started, dropping in front of the infantry as they formed up. It then began creeping forward at a slow pace of per minute, pausing as a protective barrage at each objective. But even at this slow pace the infantry could not keep up through the mud and were shit down by the unsuppressed machine guns. By 08.20 91st Bde could advance no further and was forced back to its start line. 20th Brigade reached Gheluvelt, but was stopped by the enemy pillboxes and the ground had to be given up at the end of the day. This failure was the last infantry action supported by 33rd DA in 1917. The batteries began to withdraw, under gas shelling, over the next few days. It had been in action for 51 days continuously. Although the batteries only kept the minimum number of men in the gun line (six men per gun), CLXII Bde had lost 315 men in the period, and CLVI almost as many. A/CLVI Battery had 26 guns disabled, and D (H)/CLXII had lost 19 guns and 106 officers and men.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, p. 351.Farndale, pp. 212–3.Macartney- Filgate, pp. 131–4.Wolff, p. 257. Winter 1917–18 33rd Divisional Artillery was given a full month in a rest area near Boulogne to absorb raw reinforcements and reorganise gun detachments around the few remaining experienced gunners. On 22 November Brig-Gen Stewart and 33rd DA staff returned to Ypres to command the batteries then supporting 33rd Division in the line at Passchendaele, with his own batteries to follow later. However, the batteries were suddenly ordered up late on 1 December and they had to rush up a long distance, with the gunners taken by motor lorry. They then relieved the army field batteries in position by sections, completing the relief by the end of 4 December. The guns along this section of front were organised into two groups: Lt-Col Bernard Butler of CLVI Bde commanded No 1 Group, which included the whole of 33rd DA, while Lt-Col E.J. Skinner of CLXII Bde commanded the waggon lines; CLXXXVI (Deptford) Bde of 39th DA formed No 2 Group. Infantry operations were at a standstill, but the artillery was active throughout the winter, under fire from German artillery and unable to prepare dugouts in the sodden ground. Firing was reduced to a minimum while the gun detachments struggled to keep their equipment serviceable in the mud and the drivers struggled to bring ammunition and supplies up the shell-shattered tracks. After just 17 days in the line, the exhausted brigades began to be rotated to the waggon lines. In January 1918 they went back up to relieve 50th (Northumbrian) Division's gunners in the No 1 and No 2 Group positions. In February the brigades were sent to the rear to calibrate their guns and undergo training with the infantry of their division, before returning to the same positions. During March the Germans increased their CB and gas shelling and began trench raids, while 33rd DA practised 'counter-preparation' barrages to meet enemy attacks.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 135–44. In February 1918, V/33 and Z/33 TMBs were abolished and the personnel split between X/33 and Y/33, now termed Mobile TMBs, each consisting of six Newton 6-inch Mortars and manned exclusively by the RFA.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 125. German Spring Offensive 18-pounder battery in action in the open during the Spring Offensive. The Germans launched their Spring Offensive on 21 March, but Second Army in the Ypres Salient was unaffected. However, the guns began to be distributed in greater depth, with alternative positions prepared, in case the German attack was widened and Second Army found itself pushed back. On 7 and 8 April, 33rd DA was relieved from the front line and went back to Poperinghe and Vlamertinghe for rest. On the afternoon of 10 April they got word that the Germans had launched a new phase of their offensive, the Battle of the Lys and the batteries were ordered up to assist the defence. That night they bivouacked by their guns, with Lewis gun teams posted for all-round defence, before taking up their positions next day. CLVI Brigade was posted between Vierstraat and Kemmel, but CLXII Bde found that the positions they had reconnoitred near Spanbroekmolen were overrun by the enemy before they could take them up, so they went into action in the woods north of Kemmel. Both brigades were supporting 19th (Western) Division, and remained in these positions until 16 April, occasionally breaking up groups of Germans seen in the distance.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 144–51. 16 April dawned with a dense fog, through which the Germans attacked without warning: the FOO of CLVI Bde at Wytschaete only saw them when they were away. He opened rifle fire against them and tried to get word to the neighbouring batteries, but was fatally wounded. Now fully aroused, the batteries poured in fire and set up new OPs. CLXII Brigade was forced to shorten its range progressively, and then to withdraw by sections as the enemy drew closer. The withdrawal was carried out under heavy shellfire. The guns remained under shellfire next day and CLVI Bde was also forced to withdraw, though CLXII Bde was able to support an attempted British counterattack near Wytschaete. The position remained stable from 17 to 25 April, with 33rd DA under the command of 9th (Scottish) Division until 22 April when a French formation took over the front.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 151–5. 18-pounder battery moving up during the Spring Offensive During 24 April the gun positions came under CB fire directed by German Observation balloons and at 01.00 on 25 April some of the batteries were warned of an impending attack. The German bombardment beginning an hour later was extremely heavy, mixing gas and high explosive (HE). When the German infantry advanced at 06.15 a thick fog blinded 33rd DA's observers on Mont Kemmel, and the gunners had to fire their counter-preparation barrage blind. 9th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, of 21st Division were driven out of their support positions by gas shelling, and took up some disused trenches on Hill 44 just in front of CLVI Bde. Soon afterwards it became clear that there were no French infantry left between the gun lines and the advancing Germans, and there was a gap to the right flank: the only infantry in the line were the 9th KOYLI and a few stragglers collected by Maj Barker of C/CLVI Bty as an escort for his guns. Hill 44 was clearly a German objective, so Lt-Cols Butler and Skinner decided to begin withdrawing their undamaged guns singly, leaving the others in action. In CLVI Bde, A Bty only had one gun able to fire from its main position, and this was soon silenced; the two guns of the advanced section under Lt Blackwell were surrounded and captured. B Battery was almost out of ammunition and its field of fire was blocked by trees, so Maj Studd had the breech blocks and sights removed except for two guns, one of which was towed out by a team from C Bty, and the other was run forward with the help of some KOYLI, and Maj Studd and four gunners engaged the enemy over open sights at a range of . C Battery was in the open: the limbers were brought up from behind, one at a time, and the first three guns were withdrawn, but one team was bogged and shot down. The last guns were kept in action by a sergeant and six gunners, the only men unwounded. D (H) Battery had its advanced gun knocked out but the rest were successfully withdrawn. By 11.00 the only gun in the forward positions still in action was Maj Studd's, protected by a thin line of the KOYLI; this gun was swung round to fire directly in the rear to drive off attackers. By 13.00 the gun was out of ammunition, so Studd removed the breech block and sight, and set off to find his battery.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 155–60. Meanwhile, CLXII Bde had been subjected to the same pre-dawn bombardment and all communication between the batteries and brigade HQ were cut, but the guns continued firing all morning. The advanced section of D Bty did still have a telephone wire operating, and reported on the German advance. At 08.00 horse teams were sent up to withdraw these two guns before they were overrun, which was carried out successfully, the gunners walking by their guns and all the wounded carried away, even though the Germans were on both flank and only away: every driver of both teams was awarded the Military Medal (MM). Once this section had retired, the main line of guns followed, withdrawing by sections to previously reconnoitred positions. Only three guns could not be extricated, two of C Bty and one of A Bty, and even these were recovered at nightfall. By the end of the day the battle had developed into a stalemate at Ridge Wood, and CLXII Bde was still in action, firing in support of the defending infantry; CLVI Bde came back into action next day. The brigades remained under shellfire for the next three days, and on 29 April they fired in support of 49th (WR) Division to repulse the last German attack on the Flanders front.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 160–5. Summer 1918 Shelling continued on both sides through early May, but there were no more major actions. On 6 May Brig-Gen Stewart took over control of all the guns of 9th (Scottish) and 30th Divisions assembled on this front in addition to his own two brigades, and some rest for batteries became possible. On 8 May there was a sharp local action, heralded by heavy German bombardment of the battery positions. Their infantry achieved a partial breakthrough in front of Ridge Wood, but this was driven back by the British guns and an energetic counter- attack by 19th Bde of 33rd Division, which had just come in to the line.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 165–6.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 112–4. Some exchanges of fire continued, and Lt-Col Skinner was wounded and evacuated on 10 May, but the batteries could be withdrawn and by 18 May the whole of 33rd DA was assembled in a rest camp as part of II Corps' reserve. It was assigned to support 49th (WR) Division and Belgian forces if required, but was not called upon. In June and July, 33rd DA was back in the line, carrying out some CB shoots and supporting occasional trench raids. On 14 July the right hand battalion of 33rd Division and the left hand of the neighbouring 6th Division attacked under cover of the guns and finally recaptured Ridge Wood. The FOOs went forward with the infantry and brought down defensive fire to break up the German counter-attacks.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 166–71. Also on 14 July, groups of officers from the US Army's 30th Infantry Division were attached to each field brigade, in preparation for 33rd Division to train 30th US Division in trench warfare. This began on 25 July, though the American division's own artillery was not present, and it would spend the rest of the war supported by British and Australian artillery units. The American infantry units began rotating with those of 33rd Division in the front line, and by 17 August the 30th US Division held the whole sector, supported by 33rd DA. This continued until the end of August, when 33rd DA was relieved and travelled south to join its parent division. It went into billets for a fortnight's rest and training before entering the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which had been launched on 8 August.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 171–3.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 117–21, 127.Yockelson, pp. 85–90. Hundred Days' Offensive Gunners wearing Small box respirators firing an 18-pounder, August 1918. 33rd Divisional Artillery moved into action north of Heudecourt during the night of 16/17 September having moved secretly up to the line by a series of long night marches. These marches had exhausted the gunners, who only had time for brief registration shoots before the attack went in at 05.20 on 18 September (the Battle of Épehy. The two brigades of 33rd DA supported 17th (N) Division in a fireplane that involve a hurricane bombardment by mortars, a creeping barrage of 18-pdrs and a half-hour smoke barrage by the 4.5s. There was also a searching barrage of 18-pdrs and 4.5s fired 200–500 yards beyond the creeping barrage. 17th (N) Division achieved all its objectives after a hard fight: Gauche Wood proved a toygh objective, but the 6-inch mortars were brought up to knock out a machine gun nest hidden amongst derelict British tanks from a previous battle. In the afternoon 33rd DA's guns engaged moving targets, broke up counter-attacks, and laid on a further creeping barrage after dark as the infantry pushed forward to consolidate just short of the Hindenburg Line.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 490–2.Farndale, p. 297.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 176–7.Seton-Hutchinson, p. 128. 33rd Division then relieved 21st Division, which had attacked on the right, and 33rd DA moved up behind it on 23 September. That night CLXII Bde was subjected to an intense enemy gas bombardment, which put Brigade HQ and B Bty completely out of action; Maj G. Fetherston of A Bty directed the whole brigade despite an earlier wound. The division's task was to capture the Hindenburg outposts covering the St Quentin Canal and there was a great deal of minor fighting. Two guns of B/CLXII were brought back into action, one each to A and C, and these two batteries were also given four captured 77mm guns, which enabled them to fire captured stocks of 'Yellow Cross' (Mustard gas) shells. The Battle of the St Quentin Canal was launched on 29 September; two brigades of 33rd Division attacked Villers-Guislain, supported by three RFA brigades (including both of 33rd DA's) under the command of Brig-Gen G.H.W. Nicholson, the CRA. However, the attack failed and the infantry were back on their starting position by nightfall, having suffered heavy casualties. The batteries had been ordered to move up behind the infantry, and were caught by shellfire, with B/CLVI Bty less than from the enemy.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 506–8.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918 Vol V, p. 116.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 177–9.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 128–31, 134–5. Despite the failure at Villers- Guislain, the Battle of the St Quentin Canal was a resounding success, the Hindenburg Line was penetrated, and the enemy in front of 33rd Division began to withdraw. The division probed forward, the artillery shelling strongpoints, and on 5 October the enemy line broke: by 16.00 CLVI Bde had completed a rough bridge over the canal and an hour later both brigades began to cross. The guns followed the infantry, the waggons came up behind. On 8 October the guns fired a barrage to support an attack by 38th (Welsh) Division. During the subsequent pursuit to the River Selle, 19th Bde advanced rapidly, accompanied by the guns of CLVI Bde operating in two- and three-gun sections, and by detachments of engineers, cavalry and machine guns, advancing under open warfare conditions and clearing a succession of villages. The brigade made an advance of seven and a half miles in a few hours on 9 October, and bringing up ammunition to the forward guns became a problem. The pursuit continued until it met strong opposition at the river itself. Next day the infantry of 33rd Division advanced down the forward slope towards the river, came under heavy fire, and was pinned down in the open. The situation was saved by CLVI Bde galloping up into an exposed position to engage four German batteries on the opposite slope.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918 Vol V, pp. 220, 239.Farndale, p. 304.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 179–84. The supply problems led to a pause before the Battle of the Selle could be launched. Although 33rd Division obtained bridgeheads across the river on 12 October, there was insufficient ammunition for a regular barrage, the guns merely firing on targets of opportunity. For the next week the guns and mortars of 33rd DA supported 38th (W) Division in preparing for the attack, bombarding enemy positions along the railway embankment, preventing working parties from repairing the wire, and firing gas shells into dead ground likely to shelter enemy troops. The attack resumed on 20 October, with 38th (W) Division taking all its objectives. Then on 23 October 33rd Division took over the advance, covered by fire from 33rd and 38th (W) DA and by a brigade from 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, all under Brig- Gen Nicholson, and with two 6-inch mortars moving up with each infantry brigade. For the attack on the second objective, 2nd Bn Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took the lead accompanied by the 18-pdrs of B/CLVI Bty and a section of 4.5s of D/CLVI Bty. The attack was so successful that the rest of the field guns found themselves left behind and had to move forward across the Selle to keep the enemy in range. Lieutenant-Colonel Butler of CLVI Bde was mortally wounded by a shellburst while riding up from Bde HQ to his batteries.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 187, 201.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 154, 166.Butler at CWGC. On 24 October 33rd Division attacked towards Le Quesnoy supported by the four brigades of 33rd DA and 38th (W) DA, but without a full barrage it failed to take its objective of Englefontaine. The guns kept up fire on all exits from Englefontaine, and on 26 October the division attacked again behind a thick barrage, 10 per cent of which was gas shells. Nicholson had to work out all the details himself because all his staff had been laid low by Spanish flu, but the operation was a complete success.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918 Vol V, pp. 249–51, 335, 362–3, 375–6.Farndale, pp. 309, 313.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 184–8.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 141–9, 154, 166. By now both field brigades were seriously weakened by the flu outbreak, but after a short rest they went back into the line on 2 November for the attack through the Forêt de Mormal towards the River Sambre. 38th (Welsh) Division attacked through the forest on 4 November, supported by 33rd DA, working forward one battery at a time to maintain the barrage. Bringing the guns up through the fallen trees was difficult. Next day 33rd Division continued towards the river. Although harassing fire was kept up before the attack, the guns were now forbidden to use HE shell for fear of causing casualties to French civilians sheltering in the villages. The advance was made without a barrage and by 10.30 the leading infantry were crossing the Sambre. Sections of guns moved up with each battalion, and by dawn on 7 November a rough bridge constructed at the bottom of a steep path allowed D/CLXII Bty to get the first guns across the Sambre. It was followed by A/CLXII, which came straight into action to break up an enemy counter-attack. The bridge was temporarily blocked by a broken-down transport waggon, but after a delay the whole brigade got across for what was the last fighting day on this part of the front. CLVI Brigade had been left behind, and CLXII Bde fired the division's last shots on 9 November. Blown bridges made further pursuit impossible.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, 1918 Vol V, pp. 496–7, 502–3, 508–9.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 189–92.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 150–3. Demobilisation 33rd Divisional Artillery was concentrated in the Wattignies sector on 11 November 1918 when news arrived of the Armistice with Germany. After the news was read out at a parade, the gunners went off to play a football match against the infantry. The batteries then returned through Northern France to billets in the Hornoy area. Demobilisation began in March 1919 and by the second week of June only an equipment guard remained with each battery. In July the last cadres entrained for Le Havre, where they were progressively shipped back to Southampton, CLVII Bde on 10 July, DAC on 12 and 17, and CLXII Bde on 27 July. A few days later they marched through Camberwell before disvabding.Macartney- Filgate, pp. 193–7.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 159–60. All surviving units of 33rd DA were disbanded in 1919 except the original A/CLXVI Bty, which in early 1917 had joined XXVI Army Field Brigade as A Bty. In 1919 this was redesignated as 165 (H) Bty and later 141 (H) Bty. It was absorbed into 55 Bty of the Regular Army in 1922.Frederick, pp. 505, 507, 554. Commanders The following officers served as CRA of 33rd Divisional Artillery during the war: * Brig-Gen W.H. Stuart, 5 July–12 November 1915 * Brig-Gen C.F. Blane, CMG, 12 November 1915 – 21 March 1917 * Brig-Gen C.G. Stewart, CMG, DSO, 21 March 1917– 29 July 1918 * Brig-Gen G.H.W. Nicholson, CMG, from 29 July 1918 126th (Camberwell) Heavy Battery, RGA Moving a 60-pounder gun out of its emplacement, 1917. 126th (Camberwell) Heavy Battery and its ammunition column were raised at Camberwll as part of 33rd Divisional Artillery in April 1915. By the time 33rd Division embarked for France, the policy was to remove heavy batteries from infantry divisions and concentrate them into heavy artillery groups (HAGs).Farndale, Annex E, pp. 355–8. 126th Heavy Bty, equipped with four 60-pounder guns, disembarked at Le Havre on 29 April 1916 and joined 22nd HAG with Fourth Army on 2 May in time for the Battle of the Somme.Allocations of Heavy Batteries RGA, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494.HAG HQs, TNA file WO 95/5494. The battery moved to 44th (South African) HAG on 6 September. Then on 24 November it was made up to six guns with a section from 197th Heavy Bty, which had just arrived from England to join Fourth Army. On 13 March 1917, 126th Hvy Bty was ordered to 31st HAG with First Army, which it joined on 21 March. Here it formed part of the counter-battery support for I Corps in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The corps' objective was Bois en Hache, north of the Ridge. There was a 48-hour preliminary bombardment, then when the attack went in at 05.30 on 9 April the most powerful and concentrated bombardment of the war so far crashed onto the German lines. The role of the 'heavies' was to bombard targets in depth and carry out a comprehensive CB fireplan. The attack was a great success.Falls, 1917, Vol I, p. 306 .Farndale, pp. 174–6. The composition of HAGs was extremely fluid, and batteries were frequently moved from one to another as operations demanded. 126th Heavy Bty moved to 15th HAG on 11 May, then to 67th HAG on 4 July, 89th HAG on 28 July, and back to 67th HAG on 10 November. It was assigned to 62nd HAG on 5 December and arrived on 22 December when the HAG joined Fourth Army, but from 23 December to 15 January 1918 it was actually attached to 68th HAG. 60-pounders deployed in the open during the German Spring Offensive. On 1 February 1918 the HAGs were redesignated 'Brigades, RGA', and became more permanent organisations. 126th Heavy Bty remained with 62nd Brigade, RGA, until the end of the war. The brigade had a mixture of 60-pounders and various heavy howitzers. 62nd Brigade transferred from Fourth to Third Army on 14 March and was still with it at the time of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918.Farndale, Annex M, p. 383. A week after 62nd Bde RGA transferred to Third Army the German Spring Offensive was launched. Part of Third Army was engaged in the desperate fighting, but overall it was not obliged to retreat as far or to abandon as many heavy guns as Fifth Army further south. By the time of the attack on Third Army's front at Arras on 28 March, 'the German artillery was ineffective and, when it opened fire, was shot to pieces by the British heavies'.The German offensive had been halted on Third Army's front by 5 April.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92–7.Farndale, pp. 274–5 Hundred Days' Offensive A 60-pounder advancing during the Hundred Days Offensive Third Army joined in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive on 21 August, without a preliminary bombardment, but with massive artillery support once the attack began.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 247–8.Farndale, pp. 290–2. By the end of August 62nd Bde RGA was with XVII Corps, and stayed with it for the rest of the war. The corps' task on 2 September was to capture the southernmost part of the Drocourt- Quéant Switch Line (the Wotan Stellung) where it joined the Hindenburg Line. Zero hour was 05.00, and at 06.00 the heavy guns including 62nd Bde switched from CB work to firing at the ground ahead of the advancing infantry between the D-Q and Hindenburg lines and on Quéant and other localities. The successful advance of 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division through this ground cracked open the defences and allowed the flanking divisions to force their way through the Hindenburg Support Position and across the roads behind.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 235–7.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 404–7. At the Second Battle of Cambrai (8–10 October 1918), XVII Corps was tasked with encircling the town of Cambrai on the south and compelling its evacuation. The heavies began a harassing bombardment on 6 October and continued this intermittently until Zero hour, 04.30 on 8 October. Despite German counter-attacks, the operation was successful.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 208–9. On 12 October, XVII Corps was pursuing the Germans towards the River Selle. Patrols found the villages of Haussy, Montrécourt and Saulzoir along the river were still strongly held, so an attack by 8th Battalion Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) was quickly arranged for 18.30 that evening. While the infantry advanced behind a field artillery barrage, 62nd Bde shelled the three villages for 50 minutes. The enemy soon cleared out of the part of Montrécourt on the west side of the Selle and 8th Queen's reached the river and got patrols across.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 253. Third Army crossed the river during the Battle of the Selle by means of a surprise attack at 02.00 on 20 October under a full moon with no preliminary barrage. 126th Heavy Bty and 62nd HAG supported XVII Corps, which seized the three villages in its front and pushed on rapidly to the high ground behind.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 335–6, 342–3.Farndale, p. 309. The next set-piece attack was the Battle of the Sambre. Zero hour for Third Army was 05.30 on 4 November, and 19th and 24th Divisions of XVII Corps attacked with complete success – some units advancing beyond their objectives – supported by 62nd Bde and many other guns, some of which had to move forward during the morning to bring down fire on the further objectives in the afternoon. By now the offensive had turned into a pursuit, and many of the heavy batteries had been left behind by the time fighting was ended by the Armistice.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 486–8.Farndale, p. 319. Postwar, 126th (Camberwell) Heavy Bty was due to become A Bty in a consolidated 62nd Bde RGA, but this order was rescinded after the Treaty of Versailles and the battery was disbanded.

Biography Richard Masters attended Solihull School in Solihull, which led to him identifying as an Aston Villa supporter. He later studied Economics and Geography (BSC) at University College London. Earlier in his career, he was the Marketing Manager for England and Wales Cricket Board from 1994 to 2000, before serving as Commercial Director for the English Football League from 2001 to 2006. He moved to the Premier League in 2006 where he became the Director of Sales and Marketing, holding the position from January 2006 until November 2018. Premier League Richard Masters was appointed as the Chief Executive of the Premier League in November 2019, following a year-long interim period in the position after the previous incumbent Richard Scudamore's resignation in December 2018. Richard Masters' role of Chief Executive was created after Richard Scudamore's Executive Chairman role was split into the two roles of Chief Executive and Chairman following Scudamore's resignation. Whilst Gary Hoffman was appointed as the new Chairman on 24 April, 2020, Richard Masters retains authority as holding the highest position at the Premier League, with his other responsibilities including leading negotiations on new media rights contracts, resolving club disputes and ownership issues, and overseeing operations. Richard Masters was the Premier League's fourth choice for the role, following a protracted recruitment process that involved Susanna Dinnage, Tim Davie and David Pemsel all being offered, but later declining the position. There were accusations that the biggest teams in the Premier League held too much influence over the process, with Liverpool and Manchester United alleged to have held private talks with candidates chosen by the Premier League's official nominating committee, before deciding whether or not to enact their unofficial veto over the decision. Coronavirus Crisis On 13th March 2020, due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, Premier League fixtures were suspended by Richard Masters following a meeting with the League's shareholders. Despite widespread calls to abandon the season, and the abandonment of equivalent foreign leagues such as Ligue 1, Eredivisie and Belgian First Division A, Masters enacted \\"Project Restart\\", a plan to safely restart Premier League fixtures on June 17th and finish the season on July 26th. This was to be achieved through strict safety protocols, such as extensive cleaning and staff testing at club training grounds, alongside zonal systems for areas of access and no fan attendance at match-day grounds. Rule changes were also voted upon during meetings with club shareholders, including the introduction of water breaks in the middle of each half, as well as the increase from three substitutes per match to five in order to minimize player fatigue and consequent injury. The Premier League season was successfully completed on July 26th, as per the original plan conceived by Richard Masters and the shareholders. On 9 September 2020, Richard Masters told the BBC that it was \\"absolutely critical\\" for fans to be allowed back into stadiums to watch Premier League matches as soon as possible, as Premier League clubs stood to suffer £700m in lost revenue if the 2020-2021 season (running from 12 September 2020 to 23 May 2021) was played behind closed doors. However, on 22 September 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that spectators would continue to be banned from attending all sporting events in England until the end of March 2021, at the earliest. Newcastle United Takeover On 14th April 2020, it emerged that a request to undertake the Premier League’s Owner and Director’s Test had been filed by a consortium consisting of Amanda Staveley's firm PCP Capital Partners, Reuben Brothers and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF), as the final stage of their £300m bid to purchase ownership of Newcastle United from Mike Ashley. It was widely anticipated that it would take around four weeks for Richard Masters and the Premier League to deliver a decision on the test, owing to the record of previous tests. However, on July 14th, 2020, a senior employee at Newcastle United told The Athletic that the ongoing delay to the Premier League’s making a decision was causing uncertainty for the club and consequently substantial damage to Newcastle United’s long-term planning. When asked for an update at various intervals by members of the media and MPs, Richard Masters refused to give any comment or time-frame for the ongoing process. On July 30, 2020, the consortium pulled out of the buying process, citing the unforeseen delay and refusal of Richard Masters to communicate a time-frame for the Owner’s and Director’s Test decision as a result causing their acquisition of Newcastle United to become untenable, particularly given their contract of sale with seller Mike Ashley had lapsed. The buyers also claimed that geopolitical interference from Qatar, as well as influential Premier League clubs lobbying against the takeover due to fear of increased competition, had caused Richard Masters to purposely avoid either approving the deal or issuing a rejection that could be appealed. After the buyers pulled out, Newcastle United fans reacted with outrage, with 97% of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) having been in favor of the takeover owing to the consortium’s plans to invest heavily in to the club and surrounding communities. Newcastle United fans started a petition, calling for a government investigation in to Richard Masters and the Premier League’s conduct due to their perceived lack of transparency and integrity; it gained more than 110,000 signatures. In addition, over eighty MPs, and the Independent Football Ombudsman (IFO) wrote to Richard Masters demanding transparency on the process of Newcastle United’s subjection to the Owner’s and Director’s test. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, further urged Richard Masters and the Premier League that \\"there must be clarity on why there was a significant delay in a decision being made.\\" On 14th August 2020, Richard Masters issued his first public statement on Newcastle United's taking of the Premier League's Owner's and Director's test, stating in a reply to MP Chi Onwurah that the Premier League had deemed there to be an insufficient legal separation between the PIF and the Saudi state, and that the consortium had declined the Premier League's offer of independent arbitration on the matter. He also denied claims of third-party influence on the process. The consortium responded that arbitration would already be available to them after the Premier League had delivered its overall decision and that undergoing arbitration before the Premier League's overall decision was a highly irregular procedure. They also claimed that the Premier League's desire to undertake an arbitration process, which has taken over a year to complete in previous instances, for one individual aspect of the Owner's and Director's Test was demonstrative of the Premier League's reluctance to deliver a final decision. On 9th September, 2020, Newcastle United released a statement which apparently confirmed that the Premier League had finally officially rejected the buying consortium's proposed takeover of Newcastle United through the consortium's failing of the Premier League's Owner's and Director's Test. Furthermore, the club's statement advised that \\"this conclusion has been reached despite the club providing the Premier League with overwhelming evidence and legal opinions that PIF is independent and autonomous of the Saudi Arabian government. The club and its owners do not accept that Premier League chief executive Richard Masters and the Premier League have acted appropriately in relation to this matter and will be considering all relevant options available to them.\\" However, on 10th September, 2020, the Premier League responded with a statement which defended the actions of Richard Masters and the Premier League, and advised that \\"the club's assertion that the Premier League has rejected the takeover is incorrect\\". According to various media reports, these statements were the result of shuttle diplomacy conducted by elements of the UK government between the buying consortium and Richard Masters, which continued informal communications even after the official withdrawal of the buying consortium's bid. During these informal communications, the offer of further concessions from the buying consortium had been rejected by Richard Masters and the Premier League. On 14th September, 2020, Blackstone Chambers announced that they had appointed Nick De Marco QC and Shaheed Fatima QC to represent Newcastle United in the club's legal action against the Premier League.

She subsequently began her career as a journalist, contributing to the French public broadcaster Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française and working as an editor for various journals and for the Nouvelle Agence de Presse. In 1977 she published her first novel, La Brise du jour, for which she drew upon her memories of her childhood in Cameroon. The book also served as a testimony on the feminine condition. With this literary work, she joined the first generation of women writers in sub-Saharan Africa, alongside the likes of Marie-Claire Matip.

Early life The son of a city architect, he attended elementary school and grammar school, and after his education was complete, was employed as a bank clerk in Cologne. In 1914 when the First World War broke out, he joined the army as a war volunteer. He won the Iron Cross second class and was wounded four times, lastly in the battle of Langemarck in Belgium, after which he was classified as severely disabled. In 1919 after discharge from the military, he returned to Cologne. He became active in the Völkisch movement and joined the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund. In 1922 he became a member of the Nazi Party. When it was temporarily banned in 1924, he switched to the National Socialist Freedom Movement and on 7 December 1924 became its only member in the Prussian Landtag. Nazi career When the Nazi Party was re- established in February 1925, Haake become the local leader of the party in Cologne. Then, on 27 March 1925, he was appointed Gauleiter of Rhineland- South. He officially re-joined the Party on 14 April (membership number 13,328). However, he proved to be difficult to work with, and was often in conflict with his Gau Business Manager, Josef Grohé. On 1 June he was replaced as Gauleiter by his Deputy, Robert Ley. In July he was made Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Group Leader) in Cologne. From 1928 to 1932 he was a manager of the Nazi faction in the Landtag, becoming 3rd Vice-President of that body in 1932. On 15 July 1932 Haake was appointed Landesinspekteur-West. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for the Gaue of Dusseldorf, Essen, Koblenz- Trier, Koln-Aachen & Saarland, and reported directly to Robert Ley. This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's fall from power in December 1932. At that time, Haake became leader of the Organization Department at the Brown House in Munich, again under Ley, who had succeeded Strasser as Reichsorganisationsleiter. After the Nazi seizure of power, Haake was elected 1st Vice President of the Prussian Landtag in March 1933. On 5 March he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 20, (Cologne-Aachen). On 11 March he was appointed Landeshauptmann of Prussia’s Rhine Province and would remain in this position until May 1945. In October 1933 he was named a member of the Academy of German Law. In 1934 he became a member of the Provincial Council of Rhine Province and also was appointed Reichsinspekteur in the Reichsleitung (Reich Leadership) of the Party. In June 1938 he was named an Honorary Senator of the University of Cologne. In February 1941, Haake attended a meeting with representatives of the Aktion T4 program, concerning the establishment of a euthanasia program for mentally institutionalized patients in Rhine Province. At first resistant, Haake relented when shown a Führer decree authorizing and ordering the implementation. A member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), he attained the rank of SA-Brigadeführer in 1936, SA-Gruppenführer in 1938 and, on 24 January 1942, SA-Obergruppenführer. At the end of the war in May 1945, he was arrested by the British. Interned in Recklinghausen, he was transferred from there to the prison hospital at Velen, where he died on 17 September.

It is a tree, and can grow up to 30 metres tall and up to 60 centimetres diameter, though it usually grows to about 15 metres tall and 45 centimetres diameter at breast height. The elliptic to oblong-shaped leaves are somewhat leathery in texture and 5 to 23 cm in length and 2 to 6 cm in width. The flowers are white, and have five stamens, of which only one is fertile. It produces obliquely subrotund drupes as fruit, these are 8 to 9 cm in diameter and have a thin layer of fibrous flesh. The seeds, like a walnut, have a very irregularly lobed and folded surface. It grows in lowlands on river banks or in swamp forests. The flowers appear from June to September, the fruits from August to November. It is sometimes grown locally for the fruit. The drupes are very sour, and they are only edible when unripe, as when ripe the pulp is too scanty and hard. A 1991 book, based on information from 1985, states that the species is rare and urgently requires conservation in eastern Borneo; in 2014, the species's conservation status on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species was assessed as 'near threatened'.

In Germany, he illustrated Kurt Tucholsky's Rheinsberg in 1912, and was managing director of the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung (BIZ). In exile in the U.S., he was a co- founder of the Black Star, a leading photo agency.  Life and career  Born in Berlin, Szafranski was a friend of the writer Kurt Tucholsky, whose first literary work, Rheinsberg, he illustrated in 1912.Ein Bilderbuch für Verliebte With his friend Tucholsky, he opened a Bücherbar (book bar) on Kurfürstendamm, where they sold cheap books and alcoholic beverages. Every purchaser of Rheinsberg received a free schnaps. He also illustrated for Klabund. By the Tucholsky illustrations, he had contact to the Ullstein Verlag, where he worked on the artistic advisory board from 1913. In the 1920s, he was managing director of the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung (BIZ), where he established high artistic standards; the magazine, published by Ullstein Verlag, was in 1933 the largest weekly in Europe with a circulation of nearly two million. He made photojournalism a new genre. In 1935, he and his family emigrated to the U.S. because of the Nazi persecution of Jews. He changed his name to Safranski. With Kurt Kornfeld and Ernest Mayer, who also came from Berlin, he founded the well-known photo agency Black Star. The agency became a destination for both U.S. photographers and immigrants from Europe, especially from Germany. Black Star sold images to leading magazines such as Life and Time. From 2005, the archive of the Black Star was held by the Ryerson University in Toronto. Safranski died in Kingston, New York.  Publications  * Selling Your Pictures. Chicago: Ziff-Davis, 1940.

Quadrics are fundamental examples in algebraic geometry. The theory is simplified by working in projective space rather than affine space. An example is the quadric surface :xy=zw in projective space {\\\\mathbf P}^3 over the complex numbers C. A quadric has a natural action of the orthogonal group, and so the study of quadrics can be considered as a descendant of Euclidean geometry. Many properties of quadrics hold more generally for projective homogeneous varieties. Another generalization of quadrics is provided by Fano varieties. Basic properties By definition, a quadric X of dimension n over a field k is the subspace of \\\\mathbf{P}^{n+1} defined by q = 0, where q is a nonzero homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 over k in variables x_0,\\\\ldots,x_{n+1}. (A homogeneous polynomial is also called a form, and so q may be called a quadratic form.) If q is the product of two linear forms, then X is the union of two hyperplanes. It is common to assume that n\\\\geq 1 and q is irreducible, which excludes that special case. Here algebraic varieties over a field k are considered as a special class of schemes over k. When k is algebraically closed, one can also think of a projective variety in a more elementary way, as a subset of {\\\\mathbf P}^N(k)=(k^{N+1}-0)/k^* defined by homogeneous polynomial equations with coefficients in k. A singular quadric surface, the cone over a smooth conic curve If q can be written (after some linear change of coordinates) as a polynomial in a proper subset of the variables, then X is the projective cone over a lower-dimensional quadric. It is reasonable to focus attention on the case where X is not a cone. For k of characteristic not 2, X is not a cone if and only if X is smooth over k. When k has characteristic not 2, smoothness of a quadric is also equivalent to the Hessian matrix of q having nonzero determinant, or to the associated bilinear form b(x,y) = q(x+y) – q(x) – q(y) being nondegenerate. In general, for k of characteristic not 2, the rank of a quadric means the rank of the Hessian matrix. A quadric of rank r is an iterated cone over a smooth quadric of dimension r − 2.Harris (1995), Example 3.3. It is a fundamental result that a smooth quadric over a field k is rational over k if and only if X has a k-rational point.Elman, Karpenko & Merkurjev (2008), Proposition 22.9. That is, if there is a solution of the equation q = 0 of the form (a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n+1}) with a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n+1} in k, not all zero (hence corresponding to a point in projective space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence defined by rational functions over k between {\\\\mathbf P}^n minus a lower-dimensional subset and X minus a lower-dimensional subset. For example, if k is infinite, it follows that if X has one k-rational point then it has infinitely many. This equivalence is proved by stereographic projection. In particular, every quadric over an algebraically closed field is rational. A quadric over a field k is called isotropic if it has a k-rational point. An example of an anisotropic quadric is the quadric :x_0^2+x_1^2+\\\\cdots+x_{n+1}^2=0 in projective space {\\\\mathbf P}^{n+1} over the real numbers R. Linear subspaces of quadrics A central part of the geometry of quadrics is the study of the linear spaces that they contain. (In the context of projective geometry, a linear subspace of {\\\\mathbf P}^N is isomorphic to {\\\\mathbf P}^a for some a\\\\leq N.) A key point is that every linear space contained in a smooth quadric has dimension at most half the dimension of the quadric. Moreover, when k is algebraically closed, this is an optimal bound, meaning that every smooth quadric of dimension n over k contains a linear subspace of dimension \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor.Harris (1995), Theorem 22.13. Over any field k, a smooth quadric of dimension n is called split if it contains a linear space of dimension \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor over k. Thus every smooth quadric over an algebraically closed field is split. If a quadric X over a field k is split, then it can be written (after a linear change of coordinates) as ::x_0x_1+x_2x_3+\\\\cdots+x_{2m-2}x_{2m-1}+x_{2m}^2=0 if X has dimension 2m − 1, or ::x_0x_1+x_2x_3+\\\\cdots+x_{2m}x_{2m+1}=0 if X has dimension 2m.Elman, Karpenko, & Merkurjev (2008), Proposition 7.28. In particular, over an algebraically closed field, there is only one smooth quadric of each dimension, up to isomorphism. For many applications, it is important to describe the space Y of all linear subspaces of maximal dimension in a given smooth quadric X. (For clarity, assume that X is split over k.) A striking phenomenon is that Y is connected if X has odd dimension, whereas it has two connected components if X has even dimension. That is, there are two different \\"types\\" of maximal linear spaces in X when X has even dimension. The two families can be described by: for a smooth quadric X of dimension 2m, fix one m-plane Q contained in X. Then the two types of m-planes P contained in X are distinguished by whether the dimension of the intersection P\\\\cap Q is even or odd.Harris (1995), Theorem 22.14. (The dimension of the empty set is taken to be −1 here.) Low-dimensional quadrics Let X be a split quadric over a field k. (In particular, X can be any smooth quadric over an algebraically closed field.) In low dimensions, X and the linear spaces it contains can be described as follows. * A quadric curve in \\\\mathbf{P}^2 is called a conic. A split conic over k is isomorphic to the projective line \\\\mathbf{P}^1 over k, embedded in \\\\mathbf{P}^2 by the 2nd Veronese embedding.Harris (1995), Lecture 22, p. 284. (For example, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas are different kinds of conics in the affine plane over R, but their closures in the projective plane are all isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^1 over R.) * A split quadric surface X is isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^1\\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1, embedded in \\\\mathbf{P}^3 by the Segre embedding. The space of lines in the quadric surface X has two connected components, each isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^1.Harris (1995), Lecture 22, p. 285. * A split quadric 3-fold X can be viewed as an isotropic Grassmannian for the symplectic group Sp(4,k). (This is related to the exceptional isomorphism of linear algebraic groups between SO(5,k) and \\\\operatorname{Sp}(4,k)/{\\\\pm 1}.) Namely, given a 4-dimensional vector space V with a symplectic form, the quadric 3-fold X can be identified with the space LGr(2,4) of 2-planes in V on which the form restricts to zero. Furthermore, the space of lines in the quadric 3-fold X is isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^3.Harris (1995), Exercise 22.6. * A split quadric 4-fold X can be viewed as the Grassmannian Gr(2,4), the space of 2-planes in a 4-dimensional vector space (or equivalently, of lines in \\\\mathbf{P}^3). (This is related to the exceptional isomorphism of linear algebraic groups between SO(6,k) and \\\\operatorname{SL}(4,k)/{\\\\pm 1}.) The space of 2-planes in the quadric 4-fold X has two connected components, each isomorphic to \\\\mathbf{P}^3.Harris (1995), Example 22.7. * The space of 2-planes in a split quadric 5-fold is isomorphic to a split quadric 6-fold. Likewise, both components of the space of 3-planes in a split quadric 6-fold are isomorphic to a split quadric 6-fold. (This is related to the phenomenon of triality for the group Spin(8).) As these examples suggest, the space of m-planes in a split quadric of dimension 2m always has two connected components, each isomorphic to the isotropic Grassmannian of (m − 1)-planes in a split quadric of dimension 2m − 1.Harris (1995), Theorem 22.14. Any reflection in the orthogonal group maps one component isomorphically to the other. The Bruhat decomposition A smooth quadric over a field k is a projective homogeneous variety for the orthogonal group (and for the special orthogonal group), viewed as linear algebraic groups over k. Like any projective homogeneous variety for a split reductive group, a split quadric X has an algebraic cell decomposition, known as the Bruhat decomposition. (In particular, this applies to every smooth quadric over an algebraically closed field.) That is, X can be written as a finite union of disjoint subsets that are isomorphic to affine spaces over k of various dimensions. (For projective homogeneous varieties, the cells are called Schubert cells, and their closures are called Schubert varieties.) Cellular varieties are very special among all algebraic varieties. For example, a cellular variety is rational, and (for k = C) the Hodge theory of a smooth projective cellular variety is trivial, in the sense that h^{p,q}(X)=0 for p eq q. For a cellular variety, the Chow group of algebraic cycles on X is the free abelian group on the set of cells, as is the integral homology of X (if k = C).Fulton (1998), Example 19.1.11. A split quadric X of dimension n has only one cell of each dimension r, except in the middle dimension of an even-dimensional quadric, where there are two cells. The corresponding cell closures (Schubert varieties) are:Elman, Karpenko & Merkurjev (2008), Proposition 68.1. * For 0\\\\leq r, a linear space \\\\mathbf{P}^r contained in X. * For r = n/2, both Schubert varieties are linear spaces \\\\mathbf{P}^r contained in X, one from each of the two families of middle-dimensional linear spaces (as described above). * For n/2, the Schubert variety of dimension r is the intersection of X with a linear space of dimension r + 1 in \\\\mathbf{P}^{n+1}; so it is an r-dimensional quadric. It is the iterated cone over a smooth quadric of dimension 2r − n. Using the Bruhat decomposition, it is straightforward to compute the Chow ring of a split quadric of dimension n over a field, as follows.Elman, Karpenko, & Merkurjev (2008), Exercise 68.3. When the base field is the complex numbers, this is also the integral cohomology ring of a smooth quadric, with CH^j mapping isomorphically to H^{2j}. (The cohomology in odd degrees is zero.) * For n = 2m − 1, CH^*(X)\\\\cong \\\\Z[h,l]/(h^m-2l, l^2), where h = 1 and l = m. * For n = 2m, CH^*(X)\\\\cong \\\\Z[h,l]/(h^{m+1}-2hl, l^2-ah^ml), where h = 1 and l = m, and a is 0 for m odd and 1 for m even. Here h is the class of a hyperplane section and l is the class of a maximal linear subspace of X. (For n = 2m, the class of the other type of maximal linear subspace is h^m-l.) This calculation shows the importance of the linear subspaces of a quadric: the Chow ring of all algebraic cycles on X is generated by the \\"obvious\\" element h (pulled back from the class c_1O(1) of a hyperplane in {\\\\mathbf P}^{n+1}) together with the class of a maximal linear subspace of X. Isotropic Grassmannians and the spinor variety The space of r-planes in a smooth n-dimensional quadric (like the quadric itself) is a projective homogeneous variety, known as the isotropic Grassmannian or orthogonal Grassmannian OGr(r + 1, n + 2). (The numbering refers to the dimensions of the corresponding vector spaces. In the case of middle-dimensional linear subspaces of an quadric of even dimension 2m, one writes \\\\operatorname{OGr}_{+}(m+1,2m+2) for one of the two connected components.) As a result, the isotropic Grassmannians of a split quadric over a field also have algebraic cell decompositions. The isotropic Grassmannian W = OGr(m,2m + 1) of (m − 1)-planes in a smooth quadric of dimension 2m − 1 is also called the spinor variety, of dimension m(m + 1)/2. (Another description of the spinor variety is as \\\\operatorname{OGr}_{+}(m+1,2m+2).) To explain the name: the smallest SO(2m + 1)-equivariant projective embedding of W lands in projective space of dimension 2^m-1.Ottaviani (1988), section 1. The action of SO(2m + 1) on this projective space does not come from a linear representation of SO(2m+1) over k, but rather from a representation of its simply connected double cover, the spin group Spin(2m + 1) over k. This is called the spin representation of Spin(2m + 1), of dimension 2^m. Over the complex numbers, the isotropic Grassmannian OGr(r + 1, n + 2) of r-planes in an n-dimensional quadric X is a homogeneous space for the complex algebraic group G=\\\\operatorname{SO}(n+2,\\\\mathbf{C}), and also for its maximal compact subgroup, the compact Lie group SO(n + 2). From the latter point of view, this isotropic Grassmannian is :\\\\operatorname{SO}(n+2)/(\\\\operatorname{U}(r+1)\\\\times \\\\operatorname{SO}(n-2r)), where U(r+1) is the unitary group. For r = 0, the isotropic Grassmannian is the quadric itself, which can therefore be viewed as :\\\\operatorname{SO}(n+2)/(\\\\operatorname{U}(1)\\\\times \\\\operatorname{SO}(n)). For example, the complex spinor variety OGr(m, 2m + 1) can be viewed as SO(2m + 1)/U(m), and also as SO(2m+2)/U(m+1). These descriptions can be used to compute the cohomology ring (or equivalently the Chow ring) of the spinor variety: :CH^*\\\\operatorname{OGr}(m,2m+1)\\\\cong \\\\Z[e_1,\\\\ldots,e_m]/(e_j^2-2e_{j-1}e_{j+1}+2e_{j-2}e_{j+2}-\\\\cdots+(-1)^je_{2j}=0\\\\text{ for all }j), where the Chern classes c_j of the natural rank-m vector bundle are equal to 2e_j.Mimura & Toda (1991), Theorem III.6.11. Here e_j is understood to mean 0 for j > m. Spinor bundles on quadrics The spinor bundles play a special role among all vector bundles on a quadric, analogous to the maximal linear subspaces among all subvarieties of a quadric. To describe these bundles, let X be a split quadric of dimension n over a field k. The special orthogonal group SO(n+2) over k acts on X, and therefore so does its double cover, the spin group G = Spin(n+2) over k. In these terms, X is a homogeneous space G/P, where P is a maximal parabolic subgroup of G. The semisimple part of P is the spin group Spin(n), and there is a standard way to extend the spin representations of Spin(n) to representations of P. (There are two spin representations V_{+}, V_{-} for n = 2m, each of dimension 2^{m-1}, and one spin representation V for n = 2m − 1, of dimension 2^{m-1}.) Then the spinor bundles on the quadric X = G/P are defined as the G-equivariant vector bundles associated to these representations of P. So there are two spinor bundles S_{+},S_{-} of rank 2^{m-1} for n = 2m, and one spinor bundle S of rank 2^{m-1} for n = 2m − 1. For n even, any reflection in the orthogonal group switches the two spinor bundles on X. For example, the two spinor bundles on a quadric surface X\\\\cong \\\\mathbf{P}^1\\\\times\\\\mathbf{P}^1 are the line bundles O(−1,0) and O(0,−1). The spinor bundle on a quadric 3-fold X is the natural rank-2 subbundle on X viewed as the isotropic Grassmannian of 2-planes in a 4-dimensional symplectic vector space. To indicate the significance of the spinor bundles: Mikhail Kapranov showed that the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a split quadric X over a field k has a full exceptional collection involving the spinor bundles, along with the \\"obvious\\" line bundles O(j) restricted from projective space: :D^b(X)=\\\\langle S_{+},S_{-},O,O(1),\\\\ldots,O(n-1)\\\\rangle if n is even, and :D^b(X)=\\\\langle S,O,O(1),\\\\ldots,O(n-1)\\\\rangle if n is odd.Kapranov (1988), Theorem 4.10. Concretely, this implies the split case of Richard Swan's calculation of the Grothendieck group of algebraic vector bundles on a smooth quadric; it is the free abelian group :K_0(X)=\\\\Z{S_{+},S_{-},O,O(1),\\\\ldots,O(n-1)} for n even, and :K_0(X)=\\\\Z{S,O,O(1),\\\\ldots,O(n-1)} for n odd.Swan (1985), Theorem 1. When k = C, the topological K-group K^0(X) (of continuous complex vector bundles on the quadric X) is given by the same formula, and K^1(X) is zero.

Ackerley. Published by Chatto and Windus in 1932, it is written in the form of (and based on) a journal which Ackerley kept during his five-month engagement as secretary to Vishvanath Singh, Maharajah of Chhatarpur between December 1923 and May 1924.Parker, Peter (1989) Ackerley, London: Constable. , p. 64 Described on publication as a \\"gay satire on autocracy\\",Rear of first edition dustjacket. the text contains four line drawings by Ackerley himself. Content The book has date entries rather than chapters, and is split into two parts. It is explicitly not a travel journal: Ackerley provides no account of his journey to or from India, and he has comparatively little to say about the environment beyond a few descriptions of his immediate locale. As if to further emphasise this, Part One ends with Ackerley preparing for a trip to Varanasi (identified as Benares in the book), and Part Two begins with his return to Chhatarpur. (Ackerley renames it 'Chhokrapur', and in his introduction he confesses he \\"made up\\" the name, and \\"it would be idle to explore the map\\",Ackerley, J.R. (1932) Hindoo Holiday, London: Chatto and Windus. p. xi however in practice it could not realistically be mistaken for anywhere else.) At the start of the book, Ackerley lists the \\"Principal Characters\\", aside from himself.In his 1989 biography, Peter Parker, identifies the real names of the characters in the book (pp. 67-72) Tellingly, only Indians appear on the list; despite their presence throughout, he includes no Europeans or Anglo-Indians here. Apart from the Maharajah, there is the Dewan (the Maharajah's Prime MinisterPandit Shudeko Behari Misra), Babaji RaoBabu Gulab Rai (the Maharajah's private secretary), Abdul Haq (Ackerley's exasperating Hindi tutor), NarayanMadaheo Nayak (Clerk of the Maharajah's Guest House), SharmaParker identifies 'Sharma' with the mononym Rāghunāndi. (the Maharajah's valet, and the apple of Ackerley's eye throughout the book), Hashim (waiter at the Guest House) and finally Habib, described as being \\"about twelve\\", Ackerley's miraculously over-zealous servant. Throughout the novel, and in common with the time, Ackerley refers to Muslims such as Abdul and Hashim as \\"Mohammedans\\". Although a comic memoir, Hindoo Holiday is, certainly in terms of humour, comparatively free of what would be now termed racial profiling, even making allowances for the time of its writing. There is only one use of eye dialect (avay is used on a couple of occasions for \\"away\\"); instead, much of the comedy stems from Ackerley's struggles to come to terms with the complexities of Hinduism and the caste system, and most significantly from the comic timing of the dialogue. At no point are any Indians held up to ridicule; indeed Ackerley tends to reserve this for the pompous and often absurd Europeans who drift through the narrative - two cases in point being the preposterous Mrs Bristow, whose contrary, vacuous small- talk leaves Ackerley dumbfounded,(1932), p. 107 and the architect Mr Bramble, who is engaged to construct a 'Greek Temple' for the Europhile Maharajah. Most of the Europeans emerge as comparatively one-dimensional, in contrast to the complex depictions of the Maharajah, with his profligate life and his homosexual attractions, or of the persona of Abdul, whose relentless pursuit of Ackerley for his own personal gain is more than counterbalanced by the stark poverty of his existence. In a passage written with not a hint of pathos, Abdul's meagre home life is described in vivid detail, before the narrative returns to an extensive series of interactions where Abdul attempts to extract money or influence (or both) from the hapless Ackerley.A case could possibly be built that Ackerley indulges in what Edward Said coined as orientalism, but even here, the narrative does not pass judgement, it merely records what Ackerley hears and witnesses, in all its — to Western sensibilities — oddness. Ackerley also deliberately presents almost all of the Europeans as just as odd in their own way.

The Vikings forced Alfred to flee Chippenham and managed temporarily to gain control over most of Wessex. The battle was part of a coordinated strike on Wessex led by Guthrum and Ubba, breaking an earlier truce between the two sides. Alfred, spending the winter at Chippenham, was without his army and was forced to flee to Athelney. Following Ubba's defeat to Odda, Ealdorman of Devon, Alfred managed to muster his forces and reclaim Wessex following the Battle of Edington in May 878. Guthrum would not attack Wessex again, agreeing to the Treaty of Wedmore. Alfred would then reorganise the army of Wessex to ensure there was always a standing force ready to meet a threat.  Background  The Vikings first started raiding the British coast towards the end of the eighth century, with monasteries such as Lindisfarne in northern Britain being attacked. These raids would continue and in the 860s Viking armies arrived in Britain with the intention of conquest. The Great Heathen Army of Vikings first arrived in 865 and within a decade they had conquered the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia and Northumberland. Shortly before Alfred the Great was named king in 871, the Vikings had also attacked Wessex where Alfred defeated them at the Battle of Ashdown. Despite this victory, Alfred was still forced to pay off the Vikings to prevent subsequent invasions. In 874 the Viking army divided, with a contingent under Guthrum heading south along the coast towards Wessex, and a supply fleet sailing in support. In 875 or 877, following a storm which caused the loss of this fleet, the Vikings were surrounded by Alfred at Exeter and forced to leave Wessex after an exchange of hostages was made as a sign of good faith. This truce would be broken in 878, when the Vikings launched a coordinated attack led by Guthrum from East Anglia, and by Ubba who appeared in the Severn.  Battle = Anglo-Saxons  Two round, wooden shields from Thorsberg moor; dating to the 3rd century CE, they are similar to the shields used by the Anglo-Saxons At this time Wessex was defended by the fyrd, a force made up of the lords and commoners of the realm and raised on an ad-hoc basis. It took time to assemble a fighting force, and this system was intended to allow for short, decisive engagements. It was necessary to disband this force once the campaign was over. These men were typically armed with spears, although wealthier men might have carried a sword. For armour, the fyrd wore a conical helmet and carried a round shield, with wealthier men owning a chain mail coat.  Vikings  The weaponry of the Vikings varied according to their social class. Most would have carried a spear, shield and an axe or short knife. Wealthier Vikings would have also carried javelins, and might have had a helmet. It is thought armour was limited to nobility and professional warriors. The tactics of the Vikings were to take defensible sites such as royal estates, improve upon the defences, and raid the surrounding land from this base, avoiding confrontations with superior forces. These tactics would work well against the Anglo-Saxons who were unused to the siege warfare required to take these fortified sites, and whose logistical system was designed for short campaigns.  Chippenham  Alfred was wintering at his royal estates near Chippenham, when Guthrum surprised him and launched an attack just after New Year. With the fyrd not assembled Alfred was forced to flee and the Vikings were able to take Chippenham. Guthrum's onslaught occurred when the Saxon soldiers were celebrating Epiphany and completely wrecked Alfred's army, killing many warriors and scattering the rest. Some of the survivors fled across the English Channel to France.  Aftermath  Relative locations of Chippenham, Athelney and Edington Following his defeat at Chippenham, Alfred was forced to retreat to the Island of Athelney, and the Vikings came close to ruling all of Wessex. From Athelney, Alfred would gather his forces and in May would defeat Guthrum at the Battle of Edington. Combined with Ubba's defeat to Odda, Ealdorman of Devon at the Battle of Cynwit earlier in the year, this would allow Alfred to retake Wessex. Following the Treaty of Wedmore, Guthrum was baptised and left Wessex. Learning from his defeat, Alfred would reorganise the military structure of Wessex, ensuring that there would always be some troops in the field to defend the kingdom. When the Vikings attacked Wessex again 13 years later, they would find it defended by a mobile standing army able to counter the threat. This was to be achieved by rotating the fighting men over time, ensuring that there were always some at home to defend their own lands.

In 2011, it is estimated that 70,000 people attended. The festival celebrates Saint Lawrence, a deacon from Spain, who was martyrized during the Roman's persecution of the Catholic Church during the rule of Valerian. Lawrence died in a fire on August 10, 258 in Rome. The celebration begins on August 6th each year, when hundreds of religious dancers arrive in the city, from nearby places such as Iquique, Calama, Arica, Alto Hospicio, and Tocopilla. Recently, attendees from Antofagasta began attending and sleeping in tents throughout the city during the festival. One of the largest attractions of the festival is the extravagant dances which are performed by different Catholic dance troupes during the festival. These dances are performed to please or worship Saint Lawrence or to demonstrate their faith. In 2005, the festival did not occur as normal. This is due to severe damages from the earthquake which occurred earlier that year. Despite these damages, the temple of San Lorenzo was rebuilt. Furthermore, in 2013, a large number of cases of influenza led to infection control methods being implemented at the festival. The festival was cancelled by Guillermo Vera, bishop of the diocese of Iquique, in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile.

Biography  Born on May 30, 1876 in Plats, Ardèche, Banc entered religious life as a novitiate nun at 17 and received the name “Sister Marie des Anges” (Sister Mary of the Angels). In time, she taught in Saint-Victor, Arras (Pas-de-Calais), Saint-Félicien (Ardèche) and Arlebosc. In 1942, Marie Banc was the Mother Superior of the Saint-Joseph Convent in Saint-Félicien, where she was responsible for two boarding schools, one for boys and one for girls. In December of that year, she was asked to conceal two Jewish children: Henri Amzel, age 10, and his sister, Denise, age 6 at the schools. A simplified version of the medal awarded to those who are named Righteous Among the Nations.The Amzel family had immigrated to Paris from Eastern Europe but left that city when the war reached Paris, traveling to Marseilles where the parents rented an apartment with their two children. Their building's owner, understanding the danger facing the family in that city, suggested that instead of staying there, the children be housed in the Catholic boarding schools in Saint-Félicien, run by Banc. The parents moved from Marseilles to the schools' nearby village and Banc welcomed the children to the school and enrolled them as Catholics. With their close proximity, the parents and children could see one another on Sundays. Because the family was of only modest means, Banc covered the enrollment and boarding expenses for both students for both years at no cost to the family. Commemorative plaque for Marie Banc (Sister Mary of the Angels). Even though the German Gestapo searched the village regularly, and deported any Jews found there, the two children remained undetected because only Marie Banc and the directors of the two boarding schools knew that two Jewish children were living among the other Christian students. The scheme worked. Henri and Denise both survived undetected at the school and at war's end they were permanently reunited with their parents. Marie Banc died at 88 years of age on March 27, 1965 in Saint-Félicien, France.  Recognition  On March 4, 2001, Yad Vashem recognized Marie Banc as Righteous Among the Nations, which is recognition given to \\"non-Jews who took great risks to save Jews during the Holocaust.\\" A commemorative plaque was installed at the house where Banc was born and unveiled by the mayor of the village of Plats during an official ceremony held on Saturday, May 30, 2009.

The tube above ground is usually seen around 15 to 20 cm above ground level. The tube is loosely connected to the burrow at ground level, and pulling the tube breaks it above ground and leaves the spider safe underground. Tube spiders may live in colonies, where tubes are attached to each other, resembling organ pipes. The tubes are camoflauged with particles of earth, moss and lichen. The vibration of crawling insects on the tube is said to alert the spider to potential prey.

Technische Militärakademie) was a military training facility founded in 1717 for certain officer groups of the Habsburg Monarchy. The location of the academy changed several times in the course of its existence: originally located in Vienna, it was located in Klosterbruck near Znaim from 1851 to 1869, in the Stiftskaserne in Vienna from 1869 to 1904 and finally in Mödling from 1904 to 1918. The Higher Technical Education Institute Mödling emerged from the academy in 1919. History=18th century The origins of the Technical Military Academy of the Austro-Hungarian Army up to 1918 go back to Field Marshal Prince Eugene of Savoy. During the War of the Spanish Succession he recognized the shortage of military engineers in the Habsburg army and urged Emperor Charles VI to set up a corresponding training facility (formal engineering academy). This was then implemented provisionally in 1717 and permanently in 1720. The Technical Military Academy was thus much older than the Theresian Military Academy founded in Wiener Neustadt in 1751. Between 1718 and 1743, some 300 pupils attended the academy. Its first principal, deputy-director and lead instructor was the engineer, cartographer and lieutenant colonel Leander Anguissola.Hochedlinger, Austria's Wars, p. 124 In 1743, the Imperial Councilor, astronomer, mathematician and head of the academy Johann Jakob Marinoni submitted a memorandum to the regent Maria Theresa, in which he referred to the urgently needed establishment of a military engineering corps, which took place in 1747. In the years that followed, the military engineering academy changed name and location in Vienna several times. Marinoni died in 1755 and the institution was combined with the Chaos Foundation (which had served as a civil and military engineering orphanage since the late 1730s) and the Savoyard Noble Academy (Savoyische Ritterakademie, created in 1749) as a government-controlled engineering school in 1756. In 1760 it was totally militarized and put under the control of the corps of engineers. The best students joined the corps, while the rest were sent to infantry and cavalry regiments.Hochedlinger, Austria's Wars, pp. 124, 306–307 19th century Under Emperor Francis II the engineering academy reached the peak of its reputation and can be described as the most important technical university of the Habsburg Monarchy. The academy was also reformed by merging the military engineer corps with the less academically educated sappers and miners to form the “genius corps”. It now actually consisted of two academies, one for future artillery officers and the other for genius officers. As a result, the academy temporarily lost some of its high reputation and in 1851 even had to go into exile as a genius academy in Klosterbruck near Znaim. In 1869 the institute returned to the collegiate barracks in Vienna and remained there until it moved to the newly constructed building in Mödling in 1904. According to István Deák, the Technical Military Academy consistently produced highly qualified artillerymen, fortress builders and sappers. Its graduates had extraordinary knowledge, formed an exclusive circle and were highly respected.István Deák, Der K.(u.)K. Offizier 1848–1918 translated by Marie- Therese Pitner, Böhlau Verlag (Wien-Köln-Weimar) 1991, p. 105. 20th century Since the buildings of the Viennese collegiate barracks no longer met the requirements of a technical military academy towards the end of the 19th century, people began to look for a new location. The choice fell on building a new military academy in Mödling. On the northern slope of the Eichkogel, 18 hectares of a pasture was purchased by the Reich Ministry of War for four million crowns from the city of Mödling in 1896. This sum was to be paid off in installments over the next 54.5 years, but the last installment was due to the collapse of Austria-Hungary as early as 1918. Despite the lack of installment payments, the city of Mödling benefited from the construction of the academy, as its popularity increased enormously and the economy also benefited from the frequent visitors. In 1901, the construction of the main building and the other 25 individual buildings began according to the plans of the military chief engineer Paul Acham, which was completed in 1904 and opened on 4 November 1904 by Emperor Franz Joseph. Up to 370 students could live and be taught in the academy at this time. In addition, there was an almost self- sufficient infrastructure. In addition to the facilities required for military operations such as stables and parade grounds, there was also a gardening shop, a butcher's shop, a sick and isolation pavilion, several libraries, a swimming pool, a hairdresser's room, etc. With the dissolution of Austria- Hungary and after only 14 years of study at the Mödling site, the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy ceased operations on 12 November 1918 with the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria. Military significance Those who attended the Technical Military Academy in Mödling (1904 to 1918) were recruited from graduates from military high schools or civilian high school graduates. The curriculum of the three-year training differed from the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in that artillery, technical weapons training and military construction were given much greater weight. Of the graduates from the Technical Military Academy who had been retired as lieutenants, 30 went to the artillery each year, while 25 were transferred to the engineer, railroad and telegraph regiments. The Technical Military Academy also organized the \\"higher artillery course\\" for officers at regular intervals, in which the future members of the artillery staff (from 1896 \\"officers in special use of artillery\\") were trained. The successful graduates of this two-year course were deployed as specialists in the higher command and authorities of the army and were also able to advance to artillery engineers. In peacetime the \\"officers in special use of the artillery\\" were responsible for the uniformity of the training of the artillery and supervised the service in the artillery production facilities. Notable graduates Among the graduates of the Technical Military Academy were * Alexander von Krobatin, later field marshal and war minister * Hermann Kövess von Kövessháza, later field marshal and last commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Army * Paul Puhallo von Brlog, later colonel general * Theodor Körner , later President of Austria * Richard Körner, later a lieutenant colonel specializing in artillery * József Heszlényi, later Colonel General of the Hungarian Armed Forces * Tadeusz Kutrzeba, Polish general * Gustav von Myrdacz, Albanian general * Moritz Erwin von Lemagh, major general * Godwin von Brumowski, fighter ace * Herman Potočnik, space theorist * Otakar Borůvka, mathematician * Roland Weitzenböck, mathematician * Arthur Porr, civil engineer and concrete-based construction inventor ReferencesBibliography * Hochedlinger, Michael.

Partially due to his academic issues, Williams received no Division I scholarship offers, so he decided to attend Indian Hills Community College. College career As a freshman, Williams averaged 9.3 points and 1.7 steals per game on a team that finished 29-5. During his sophomore season, Williams averaged 14.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game and earned All-Region first team honors. He helped lead Indian Hills to a 33-1 record. Williams committed to Kent State due to its relatively close distance to his home in Chicago. As a junior, he averaged 11.5 points and 4.0 rebounds per game. On February 21, 2020, Williams posted a career-high 34 points in a 104-98 double overtime loss to Buffalo. He followed up that performance by scoring a game-high 17 points to lead Kent State past Miami (Ohio) 74-61. As a senior, Williams averaged 14.7 points, 3.8 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game. He was named to the Second Team All-MAC as well as the MAC Defensive Team. Professional career On August 8, 2020, Williams signed with Vevey Riviera of the Swiss Basketball League.

The photograph was made at the corner of the Fifth Avenue and the 35th Street in New York. It was one of the first pictures that Stieglitz took using a more practical hand camera after his return from Europe. Stieglitz later wrote that this photograph was the result of a three hour wait in a rather inclement snow storm: “In order to obtain pictures by means of the hand camera it is well to choose your subject, regardless of figures, and carefully study the lines and lighting. After having determined upon these watch the passing figures and await the moment in which everything is in balance; that is, satisfies your eye. This often means hours of patient waiting.

Among other projects, he is known for performing under the name Selfieman. Previously, he played guitar with the punk band Тараканы! (Cockroaches), drums with punk supergroup Ракеты из России (Rockets from Russia), as well as singing and playing guitar with the band Фея Драже (Sugar Plum Fairy). Biography Early life and musical studies Nikolai Stravinsky was born in the city of Ulyanovsk on 23 February 1986. He was interested in music since childhood, and on his fifth birthday, his parents gave him a toy drum. Stravinsky learned to play the drum, and later began to study the guitar and piano. His musical tastes were influenced by The Beatles, which remain one of his favorite bands. His parents sent Stravinsky to a music school, where he sang in the choir. He continued by spending nine years at a dance school, where he studied classical, folk, and pop dances. At the age of 18, Stravinsky moved to Samara to continue his studies. In 2007, he graduated in classical guitar studies, and in 2013, he completed drum studies at the Samara State Institute of Culture. While there, he worked for a year and a half as a percussionist in the symphony orchestra of the opera and ballet theater. Sugar Plum Fairy After graduating, Stravinsky performed in various rock groups, but the turning point in his musical career was the creation of the band Фея Драже (Sugar Plum Fairy), which he joined as vocalist. Once part of the band, he also began to play guitar and write lyrics. Фея Драже played their first concert on 25 August 2005, though at this stage they were called Трупы на запчасти (Corpses for Parts). They adopted the name Sugar Plum Fairy from Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker. They recorded their first album, Не думай, Не Повторяй — Просто Действуй (Don't Think, Don't Repeat - Just Act), in their hometown of Samara and mixed it in Saint Petersburg with the help of the sound engineer for local band Animal Jazz. It was released in 2009. Фея Драже released their second and last album, Danse de la Fée Dragée, in 2010, before breaking up. At this point, Stravinsky moved to Moscow. Rockets from Russia and Cockroaches! After moving to Moscow, Stravinsky joined the cover band Ракеты из России (Rockets from Russia). He mainly played drums but also sang some songs with the group. In 2011, the rhythm guitarist of the punk band Тараканы! (Cockroaches!) left and Dmitry Spirin, the band's vocalist, who also played guitar in Ракеты из России, asked Stravinsky to take over. He was initially a temporary member but a year later his status with the band became permanent. He took part in the recording of the band's albums MaximumHappy I (2013) and MaximumHappy II (2013), as well as Сила одного (The Power of One) (2016). During the band's Baltic mini-tour of Latvia and Estonia in 2014, the drummer wasn't able to get a visa, and thus Stravinsky replaced him on the kit for the duration of the tour. In 2017, Stravinsky left both Тараканы! and Ракеты из России after obtaining permanent residence in the United States. Selfieman and other projects Transparent Things album cover In 2009, Animal Jazz recorded a cover version of the song \\"Круги на воде\\" (Circles on the Water) by Mashina Vremeni, and Stravinsky was asked to record a guitar solo for it. In July 2013, the musician starred in the Snow Patrol video for the song \\"The Lightning Strike\\". Also in 2013, Stravinsky released his first experimental solo project under his own name, a 3-track single with pop rock and electronic influences. The record included collaborations from Anton Semin of Ideя Fix, David \\"Ptaha\\" Nuriev of Centr, Sergei Repin from Фея Драже, and Timur Yessetov of Anacondaz. At the end of 2013, Ideя Fix invited Stravinsky to work on their single \\"Куадрилья Баллиста\\", for which he recorded two guitar solos. In 2014, Stravinsky launched the one-man synthpop/rock project Selfieman. According to Stravinsky, the name is a combination of \\"selfie\\" and \\"mania\\", and all the songs are sung in English. All vocal and instrumental parts are performed by Stravinsky, and all lyrics are written by his friend, novelist and poet Dmitry Labzin. The project's first album, Transparent Things, was recorded at studios in Düsseldorf and Moscow and released in 2014. Stravinsky has stated that the music of Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro influenced his songwriting on the album. The project quickly gained popularity and saw Stravinsky performing at various festivals, including Dobrofest. The live lineup for Selfieman included drummer Sergei Kivin and guitarist Yevgeny Ryakhovsky from Animal Jazz, as well as Sakura guitarist Alexey Lovyagin. On 12 February 2016, Selfieman's second album, Relative Time, was released. That year, Stravinsky began performing live sets without a backing band. Narkomfin In 2018, Stravinsky launched a new project, the pop punk band Narkomfin. The group's lyrics deal with social and political issues in Russia. They have released three albums to date: Ulyanovsk (2018), Голливуд (Hollywood - 2019), and Работает Железо (Works Iron - 2020).

Gibbs was the first female park commissioner in the United States. Early life Mary Hannah Gibbs was born in Atwater, Minnesota in 1879. Minnesota Governor Samuel Van Sant appointed her father, John P. Gibbs, the superintendent of Itasca State Park in 1901 and the family moved into quarters at Lake Itasca. Service at Itasca State Park Mary worked under her father as the park secretary. When her father died, Gibbs was just 24 years old, but she knew the park's operations well. She was appointed the new superintendent of Itasca State Park by Governor Van Sant in 1903. A local lumber company, the Mississippi Schoolcraft Boom and Improvement Company, built a dam to facilitate its logging operations. Concerned that the flooding would kill the park's old- growth pine forest, Gibbs ordered the company to open the dam. When Gibbs and the local sheriff brought a warrant to open the dam's lift, the company's lumber boss threatened to shoot \\"anyone who puts a hand on these levers.\\" Gibbs responded, \\"I will put my hand there, and you will not shoot it off either,\\" and tried to move the levers, though she was not strong enough to do so. After his threat was proved futile, the lumber boss ordered the gates opened, and he and another worker were brought to jail. Soon afterwards, rumors spread that Gibbs had been armed during the confrontation; the Minneapolis Journal ran a headline on April 24, 1903 reading \\"She had nerve, and a big gun.\\" The company obtained an injunction threatening Gibbs with arrest if she returned to the dam. Minnesota's attorney general reversed that injunction, ordering the lowering of the water levels. Just a week later, the governor appointed a new park commissioner, one friendlier to the logging industry. Gibbs would not accept the demotion and resigned her position. The loggers maintained a dam in the park for another fifteen years, until the supply of timber in the area was exhausted. Later life Gibbs left Minnesota shortly after resigning her position. She met and married William A. Logan, and they homesteaded 50 acres in Alberta. They had four children and moved to Vancouver in 1919. Mary Gibbs Logan died at age 104 on February 4, 1983. Legacy Although she served in the role of superintendent for only a short time, Gibbs was described in the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2015 as \\"a preservationist ahead of her time.\\" She was the first woman to serve in the role of park commissioner in the nation.

Piso tells that Furius Chresimus was acquitted of accusations of witchcraft during the aedileship of Spurius Postumius Albinus, dated 191 BC. The trial took place in a period of reaction against the growing influence of Hellenism at Rome, notably led by Albinus. Both Piso and Pliny told the story of the trial for its moralizing aspect. Chresimus was the subject of number of history paintings in France at the end of the 18th century, when Neoclassicism became fashionable, and agricultural reform had become the subject of much political debate.  Life  The only mention of Chresimus in ancient sources comes from a fragment of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who was consul in 133 BC, and notably an enemy of Tiberius Gracchus. Piso probably wrote a history called Annales in at least seven books, which he started after his censorship in 120.M. P. Pobjoy, in Cornell (ed.), Fragments of the Roman Historians, pp. 230–239. The consensus among historians is to identify the Spurius Postumius Albinus mentioned in the fragment with the consul of 186 BC, who was likely aedile in 191 BC, the most probable date of Chresimus' trial.Münzer, RE, vol. 43, col. 930, 931 (Postumius 49), thinks that Albinus should be identified with the consul of 174, and dates his aedileship from 185 BC.Broughton, vol. I, p. 353. Piso's source for the trial might have been Aulus Postumius Albinus, consul in 151 BC, and author of a Roman history in Greek. However, Gary Forsythe pointed out that Albinus' history was principally focused to the Greek world and urban matters and would not have dealt with Chresimus' story. Instead, he suggests that Piso could have found about Chresimus from oral tradition among his family, because the Postumii Albini and the Calpurnii Pisones were closely linked politically throughout the second century BC.Forsythe, Calpurnius, pp. 263, 264, 380. Chresimus was a Greek man, likely captured as slave during a war waged by the Roman Republic in the Greek east.Forsythe, Calpurnius, p. 376.Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, p. 63. He was later freed by a member of the gens Furia, from whom he took his nomen – Furius. His cognomen – Chresimus – means frugal and is the Greek equivalent of the agnomen of Piso (nicknamed Frugi).Cicero, Tusculanae Disputationes, iii. 16.Cornell (ed.), Fragments of the Roman Historians, vol. III, p. 213. No explanation is given on this coincidence. Chresimus later held a farm and in turn became a slave owner.Bradley, Cambridge World History of Slavery, pp. 378, 379. Because Chresimus yielded much better harvests from a smaller land than his neighbours, they began to envy him, then sue him for magically poisoning (veneficia) their crops during the night.Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, p. 62.Collins, Magic in the Ancient Greek World, pp. 143–145, who points that Chresimus was sued for using magic, not just potions.Teitel Paule, \\"Qvae Saga, Qvis Magvs\\", p. 746. Chresimus was prosecuted under a provision in the Law of the Twelve Tables which punished by death, or the loss of citizenship, anybody convicted of using magic to take away the fertility of someone else's soil. It is the only known trial where this law played a role. Chresimus' neighbours were probably much richer than him, and they sued him to get rid of a newcomer that could have challenged the social order. Due to his Greek origin, Chresimus may also have been the victim of his neighbours' xenophobia, who denounced him to Albinus, the curule aedile – equivalent of a prosecutor – who decided to charge him before the Centuriate Assembly.Forsythe, Calpurnius, pp. 380, 381. Albinus was known to be a firm conservative opposed to Hellenism and religious innovations, like his contemporary Cato the Censor.Forsythe, Calpurnius, p. 381–383. As consul in 186, Albinus was the leading authority in the famous Bacchanalia Case, a Greek cult of Bacchus in Southern Italy, which triggered a religious scandal and prompted Albinus to spend his entire consulship suppressing the worship.Forsythe, Calpurnius, pp. 381, 382. The trial took place on the Forum, before the other members of Chresimus' tribe and with Albinus presiding.Graf, Magic in the Ancient World, p. 64. Chresimus brought his farming equipment and his own slaves in order to present himself as more hard-working than his neighbours. Chresimus was thus unanimously acquitted and reintegrated in his tribe. The story of Chresimus is similar to two other moralizing fragments of Piso's work, especially the story of Gnaeus Flavius (the son of a freedman that became aedile).Forsythe, Calpurnius, p. 383.Cornell (ed.), Fragments of the Roman Historians, vol. II, pp. 321, 323. Piso apparently advocated a \\"benevolent paternalism\\" towards slaves as well as personal austerity from nobles in order to reduce social tensions. Piso's remark of Chresimus' well- dressed slaves also fits in this narrative.Forsythe, Calpurnius, pp. 383, 384.  In the Naturalis Historia Writing in the early Roman Empire, two centuries after Piso, Pliny the Elder included the story of Chresimus in his giant encyclopedia Naturalis Historia. The entire anecdote is taken from Piso, as Pliny appreciated his moralizing tone; he cites him more than any other Roman historian.Clemence Schultze, \\"Encyclopaedic Exemplarity in Pliny the Elder\\", in Gibson & Morello (eds.), Pliny the Elder, p. 174.M. P. Pobjoy, in Cornell (ed.), Fragments of the Roman Historians, vol. I, p. 238; vol. II, p. 327; vol. III, pp. 212, 213. Chresimus' story is told in the book of his Naturalis Historia that deals with grain (Book XVIII), in a chapter on the general principles of agriculture (Chapter VIII), and not in his book on magic (Book XXX). Pliny used the story to show that \\"hard work brings reward\\".Clemence Schultze, \\"Encyclopaedic Exemplarity in Pliny the Elder\\", in Gibson & Morello (eds.), Pliny the Elder, p. 172. Caius Furius Cressinus Accused of Sorcery, Nicolas-Guy Brenet, 1777 (Musée des Augustins, Toulouse)  In art  A French translation of Pliny's Naturalis Historia by Poinsinet de Sivery was published between 1771 and 1782. Nicolas-René Jollain (the Younger) painted the scene for the 1773 Paris salon; this was the first major painting on the theme. Nicolas-Guy Brenet's painting Caius Furius Cressinus Accused of Sorcery linked agriculture with the civic virtue of the Romans. Joseph Marie Terray, the Controller-General of Finances (1769–1774) for Louis XV, commissioned the original work, probably to allay the perception that the abbé Terray was opposed to patriotic agricultural reform. Brenet painted two versions; the first, exhibited in the 1775 Paris Salon was , while the copy painted for the 1777 salon was much larger, .

Cobb left soon afterward, but returned as printer and publisher from 1842 until 1859. Local publisher and philanthropist Joseph Battell ran the newspaper from 1883-1919. As Battell was a horse enthusiast, the paper contained an illustrated \\"Horse Department\\" featuring articles about Morgan horses which were his favorite. He would also frequently publish news about local automobile accidents because he didn't like cars' pollution and displacement of horses. The paper's original name was the People's Press, and Anti-Masonic Democrat. It underwent frequent name changes until 1850 being known by names such as People's Press, Addison County Democrat, Northern Galaxy, Middlebury People's Press, Middlebury Galaxy, Middlebury Register, and Middlebury Register and Addison County Journal.

Rubio (born May 14, 1950) is an American historian. He is a professor of history at North Carolina A&T; State University who specializes in 20th century U.S. civil rights and labor struggles. Early life and education Rubio was born on May 14, 1950, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He began working as a post office serviceman while living in Colorado which he continued when he moved to Durham, North Carolina to pursue his post-secondary school education. While earning his Bachelor of Arts and Master's degree, he worked full-time for the Colorado and North Carolina post office from 1980 until 2000. During his time there, he became more interested in black history and was inspired by Pauli Murray's book Proud Shoes: The Story of an American Family. He eventually retired from the post office in 2000 after earning a Mellon Fellowship to pursue his doctoral degree at Duke University which he received in 2006. As a doctoral student, Rubio published his first book titled A History of Affirmative Action 1619-2000 in 2001 through the University Press of Mississippi. The book was divided into seven distinct periods of African- American history which examined how white individuals fought against racial equality whenever discrimination was attempted to be nulled. He also brought about the idea of \\"the creation of the white race\\" as a method to further segregated freed Black slaves and white indentured servants. Career Upon earning his PhD, Rubio became a teaching fellow and adjunct instructor at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University while also teaching at North Carolina Central University (NCCU). After a year at both institutions, he was offered a tenure track position at North Carolina A&T; State University in 2007. While at the university, Rubio wrote his second book titled There's Always Work at the Post Office: African American Postal Workers and the Fight for Jobs, Justice, and Equality, which was a re-publication of his thesis. In his book, he argues that postal work and postal unions were central figures to African-American lives and served as an \\"avenue of black mobility and incubator of black struggle.\\" As a result, Rubio received the 2011 Rita Lloyd Moroney Book Award from the United States Postal Service (USPS).

History  The scoring system was developed in 2008. The AIR score was developed to overcome some of the drawbacks of the Alvarado score, another diagnostic scoring system for identifying appendicitis. The AIR score is one of the two scores (the other being the Adult Appendicitis Score, AAS) recommended by the 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis.  Scoring and interpretation  The AIR score is calculated by tallying \\"points\\" ascribed to meeting its criteria, which are: *Vomiting (no = 0, yes = 1) *Right iliac fossa (RIF) pain (no = 0, yes = 1) *Rebound tenderness (none = 0, light = 1, medium = 2, strong = 3) *Febrile (internal temperature ≥101.3ºF or 38.5ºC) (no = 0, yes = 1) *Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<70% = 0, 70-84% = 1, ≥85% = 2) *White blood cell count (<10×10⁹/L = 0, 10-14.9×10⁹/L = 1, ≥15×10⁹/L = 2) *Serum C-reactive protein (<10 mg/dL = 0, 10-49 mg/dL = 1, >50 mg/dL = 2)  Validation  A 2017 review found that the AIR score has a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 63% if a score of 5 is used as a cut off for indicating a positive test, whereas the sensitivity is 20% and the specificity is 97% if a score of 8 is used.  Limitations  While the AIR score has better predictive power than certain other diagnostic tools for appendicitis (e.g. the Alvarado score), it has only been validated in a small number of studies .

The First Totoposte War occurred during the presidency of Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián in Guatemala, after the overthrow of Salvadoran President Francisco Menéndez by General Carlos Ezeta in El Salvador, which caused the exile of many Salvadorans who took refuge in Guatemala and who requested the help of President Barillas Bercián to stop the armies of Ezeta. The Second Totoposte War arose after the opposition of Guatemalan President Manuel Estrada Cabrera to the integration of Guatemala with the Greater Republic of Central America since Estrada Cabrera was more inclined to work with the government of the United States. The Third Totoposte War occurred in 1906 in similar conditions. In all three wars, the Guatemalan people mockingly referred to the war as the \\"Totoposte War\\" because it only served to consume large amounts of this corn-based food, without actually fighting.  Background, 1890  On June 22, 1890, Salvadoran president Francisco Menéndez was overthrown by General Carlos Ezeta. As a result, many officials with ties to the previous administration fled the country to Guatemala. The officials made a request to Guatemalan President Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián to invade El Salvador and depose Ezeta, alleging that he was planning an invasion of Guatemala. The claims were false as the officials wanted to regain power, but Barillas Bercián believed the claims and made a decree declaring war on El Salvador on June 27, 1890.  First War  Guatemalan soldiers were mobilized to the border with El Salvador. Camilo Álvarez, a Salvadoran exile, was one of the army's commanders. The Guatemalan soldiers halted their advance when they arrived at the border. Meanwhile, Ezeta's army was busy crushing a rebellion in San Salvador, the nation's capital. After months of no combat and effective stalemate, diplomats signed a peace treaty on August 21, 1890. Guatemalans called this the \\"Totoposte War\\", since it only served to mobilize ground corn grain (totoposte) to feed troops that never fought, which damaged the economy of the country.  Interlude, 1895–1903  In 1895, the leaders of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua met in Amapala and signed the Treaty of Amapala, establishing the Greater Republic of Central America. Guatemala was invited to join, but President José María Reina Barrios refused. The nation eventually was dissolved on 29 November 1898 after Tomás Regalado lead a coup in El Salvador against Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez.Walker, Thomas W. Nicaragua, the Land of Sandino. Boulder: Westview Press, 1981., p. 17.  Second and Third Wars  Signatories of the Treaty of Marblehead that ended the third war, 28 July 1906. In 1902, the three nations again wished to reform the Greater Republic. The nation was supported by Mexican President Porfirio Díaz. Guatemala was invited to join, but President Manuel Estrada Cabrera refused. Many Guatemalans opposed Estrada Cabrera's presidency and had gone into exile in the three nations, notably former President Barillas Bercián. In 1903, determined to create the nation by force, Salvadoran President Tomás Regalado declared war on Guatemala. Estrada Cabrera responded by mobilizing 55,000 soldiers, 40,000 to El Salvador and 15,000 to Mexico. After 84 days, the war ended with no military action being taken. In 1906, Tomás Regalado declared war on Guatemala again with the consent of President Pedro José Escalón and both El Salvador and Mexico invaded the country. The Salvadorans managed to capture Asunción Mita and Jutiapa while the Mexicans under Manuel Lisandro Barillas captured Ayutla and Ocós. The Guatemalans eventually forced both forces to retreat. After two months, the war ended, but not before Tomás Regalado was killed in Guatemala on 7 July 1906.

The regiment would serve during the Anglo-French War/American Revolutionary War and the Haitian Revolution until 1796 when it formed part of a new demi- brigade. The regiment's successor, the 106éme Régiment d'Infanterie would serve the modern French Army until 1940 when it was disbanded following the Battle of France.  Anglo-French War/American Revolution = Formation  Under the 1772 French Colonial Troops Ordnance, the first colonial 'regiments' were formed from the various independent colonial legions and companies. The Régiment du Cap was formed from the infantry companies of the Légion de Sainte-Domingue and took on the role of guarding the port of Cap Français, which was one of the busiest ports in the French Antilles. From the regiment's formation in 1772 until the revolution, all French colonial regiments were uniformed in the same way; dark blue coat without lapels but with red cuffs, collars, and epaulette straps. Dark green facings, and coat lined with white and the turnbacks white with anchors indicating it was controlled the Secretary of State of the Navy (the Admiralty) Secrétaire d'État à la Marine. The regiment's grand gaiters were white, and a black tricorne with white trim and a bourbon white ribbon.Susane, Volume I, pp. 312, 359, 368.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 402–404.Lienhart & Humbert, Volume IV, p. 82Smith, Uniforms of the American War of Independence, pp. 175, 180–181. Two fusiliers of the Régiment de Pondichéry and Régiment de Martinique, and a drummer of the Régiment du Cap in 1789. During the Anglo-French War/American Revolutionary War, the regiment provided detachments to many of the naval squadrons operating in the North West Atlantic and Caribbean. One of these expeditions embarked in 1779 with the fleet of the Charles, Comte d'Estaing and took part in the Siege of Savannah.  Siege of Savannah  Towards the later end of 1779, the Continental forces were eager to re-take Savannah, Georgia, which was a launch point for many of the British raids in the area. In communication with the Continental Commander, Southern Department/Army Benjamin Lincoln a large raid was to be conducted against the city. As the Jean-Baptiste Charles, Comte d'Estaing arrived with his squadron, a small French ground force joined them. This force consisted of personnel many infantry and colonial regiments, along with a small detachment of artillery. As the squadron neared the city, it was required to stay away due to the local naval batteries and possible heavy artillery, therefore most of the troops disembarked some 5 miles away and marched to join their new American allies.Susane, Volume III, pp. 84–91.Savas & Dameron, p. 14. On 15 September the first trenches were dug, and on 24 September they vigorously repulsed an attempted exit by the British. On 9 October they were again attacked, but after a fierce battle, and the French were repulsed and force to re-embark for the West Indies again. Captain Dumouriez and two lieutenants were wounded there on 9 October during the attack on the entrenchments.  Later Campaigns  Another detachment embarked in 1782 on the frigate Amazone, where it lost Lieutenant Guilhem and several soldiers during the Action of 29 July 1782 off the coast of Cape Henry, Virginia.  Peacetime  When the troubles in Saint-Domingue started, which later expanded into the Haitian Revolution began in 1790, the regiment was employed against the band of the mutinous Vincent Ogé, and defeated it on 29 October.  French Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution. This new ordnance grouped most of the line regiments into 7 \\"classes\\" of six regiments each, the 8th series maintained the colonial regiments, and the 102nd-104th regiments. The exceptions were the foreign regiments and regiments of the household. Each class was divided further into two \\"divisions\\", each of three regiments. In the case of the du Cap Regiment, it was part of the 8th series and 5th division, and uniformed as follows; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, white collar, 'revolutionary blue' turnbacks, white jacket, white breeches, white gaiters, black boots, white pockets, 'revolutionary blue' pocket trim, crimson cuff flaps, dark green cuffs, dark green facings, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbert, Volume III, p. 43.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, pp. 43–47. Another change for the regiment came on 11 August 1791 when the regiment passed from the Admiralty to the War Department, effectively making it a regiment of the French Revolutionary Army. The regiment was also ordered to be renamed, but this doesn't seem to have happened.Smith, Napoleon's Regiments, pp. 153–154.  Haitian Revolution  A group of former slaves murdering white civilians during the Battle of Port Français. In 1791, the revolution of the black became widespread, and the regiment marched against them, attacked them on 27 August where they killed a hundred and dispersed the rest. The revolt however did eventually reach Cap Français, and the regiment fought well initially, but several times on the verge of coming to grips with the battalion of Normandie and Artois who had rebelled upon arrival on the island. Finally, the contagion of the example threw them into insubordination of their colonel the Baron de Cambefort on 19 October 1792. When the Spaniards crossed the border from Santo Domingo, the battalion regained its patriotism and under the energetic command of General Étienne Desfourneaux, the regiment showed its bravery in which it was able to wipe its distributing history. It was with 300 men that the general, at the end of 1793, defended Fort Crète-Sale against 700 Spanish.  In France  Under the 1793 amalgamations, the regiment was originally slated to form the 187éme and 188éme Demi-Brigades, but these formations never came to place, and the demi-brigades only existing on paper. In 1795 the regiment arrived in Le Havre and towards the end of that year arrived in Beauvais and joined the Army of the West Armée d'Ouest and participated in the Pacification of the West, \\"Pacification de l'Ouest\\" until late 1796. Finally, on 12 November 1796 the second wave of amalgamations caused the regiment to amalgamate with the 49éme Demi-Brigade, 29éme Régiment d'Infanterie, Bataillon des Fédéres des 83 départments, 6éme Bataillon de Volontaires de Rhône-et-Loire, 2éme Bataillon de la Formation d'Orléans, and 19éme Bataillon de Volontaires des Réserves to form the 13éme Demi-Brigade de Deuxième Formation.

Containment was progressed on the right flank, while the left flank saw spot fires from fire whirls. That same day, an air quality advisory was put in place for San Bernardino and Los Angeles Counties. The fire had grown to with 38 percent containment by the morning of August 18. That day, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed a proclamation declaring a local emergency for the fire. The fire jumped the containment line southwest of Atmore Meadows overnight into the morning of August 19, requiring helicopters to do night drops in the rugged, hard to reach area. That day, the fire grew further into Atmore Meadows and into Burnt Peak Canyon on the west flank. Repopulation began on August 21 along Shafer Road, west of Mountain View Road, south of Highway 138 and north of Pine Canyon/Elizabeth Lake Road. That evening, containment grew to over 50 percent. Repopulation continued on August 24, with residents along Kings Canyon Road east to Shafer Road being allowed to return, and on August 25, with residents south of Highway 138 and other evacuated areas. On the evening of August 25, it was announced that three additional firefighters suffered injuries in the fire. All mandatory evacuation orders and smoke advisories were lifted. Suppression repair began two days later, on August 27 with the fire at 70 percent containment. The majority of Castaic Lake State Recreation Area, which was used as a staging area, reopened to the public. As August ended, the fire was had burned and was 90 percent contained, however, the complete resources to complete full fire suppression was delayed due to the lack of resources available because of the August 2020 California lightning wildfires. Current closures As of September 3, the following areas remain closed due to the Lake Fire: *All National Forest System lands within the Lake Fire closure area *Castaic Lake Recreation Area Swim Beach and West Ramp Impact The Lake Fire threatened over 4,570 structures in the area, including homes. On August 13, mandatory evacuations were put in place for areas around Lake Hughes and portions of Highway 138 were closed. This resulted in the evacuation of 100 residences. Highland High School was opened as an evacuation point and evacuees were asked to camp in their cars, due to the inability to set up a traditional evacuation center due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Repopulation began on August 21. The fire damaged 3 structures and destroyed 12 structures and 21 outbuildings, including homes in the Pine Canyon community. One firefighter was injured. It also impacted recreational activities. Castaic Lake State Recreation Area was closed to the public to be used for meetings and staging for the duration of the fire until August 28. The fire impacted air quality in Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties. Air quality suffered and smoke and ash was visible in Lebec, Antelope Valley, Agua Dulce, and Santa Clarita Valley.

Opisthoteuthis agassizii is a lesser-known, deep-sea octopus first described in 1883. Like all cirrate octopuses, O. agassizii has fleshy fins to aid in swimming and a small internal shell. Males are up to four times heavier than females, and their suckers are proportionally larger. Both sexes are small. The largest specimen, a male, had a mantle (the body not including the octopus' arms) reaching 63 mm, a little under two and a half inches. Since their discovery in 1883, at least 68 specimens have been found in various parts of the Atlantic Ocean, usually near coasts. At least one specimen has been found in the Mediterranean Sea. They live at a maximum depth of 1,935 meters below sea level and a minimum depth of 227 meters. Like other opisthoteuthids, they occupy the benthic zone, living on or near the seafloor. These octopuses most likely prey on polychaete worms and crustaceans that live on or just above the seafloor. All females of O. agassizii become sexually mature when they reach 190 grams (6.702 oz.) and all males are sexually mature once they reach 95 g (3.351 oz.). However, both sexes continue to grow after they reach maturity. One study found that the total weight of a female didn't correlate with the number of oocytes in her body, implying that females continue to produce and lose eggs over the course of their lives. In other words, an octopus of this species might breed multiple times in its life. This is markedly different from most octopuses; the majority only reproduce once in a lifetime. While O. agassizii exists across a wide depth range, heavier octopuses generally live 700 meters or more from the ocean's surface. As age and sexual maturity correlate with weight in this species, this means octopuses at a greater depth are more likely to be sexually mature.

The treaty was negotiated by Paul-Louis- Félix Philastre for France and Nguyễn Văn Tường for Vietnam, which in the treaty is called the Kingdom of Annam. In French circles, it was often called le traité Philastre.Anna Irene Baka and Qi Fei, \\"Lost in Translation in the Sino-French War in Vietnam: From Western International Law to Confucian Semantics: A Comparative–Critical Analysis of the Chinese, French, and American Archives\\", in Anthony Carty and Janne Nijman (eds.), Morality and Responsibility of Rulers: European and Chinese Origins of a Rule of Law as Justice for World Order (Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 389–390. Following the Garnier Affair, in which a French force ostensibly aiding the Vietnamese government had wreaked havoc in Tonkin in December 1873, Philastre took control of the French expedition on 3 January 1874 and immediately began the withdrawal from Tonkin, completed by the end of February. His success put him in a strong negotiating position.Henry McAleavy, Black Flags in Vietnam: The Story of a Chinese Intervention (George Allen and Unwin, 1968), pp. 142–144. The terms of the treaty established peace and a military alliance between Vietnam and France. Vietnam ceded to France the three provinces south and east of the Mekong that had been occupied by France since 1867. They were incorporated into the French colony of Cochinchina. The Red River was opened to international trade, as were the ports of Hanoi, Haiphong and Qui Nhơn. The French were permitted to post a consul in each of these ports as well as in Huế, the capital of the Nguyễn. In exchange, the French waived the remainder of the war indemnity imposed by the Treaty of Saigon that ended the Cochinchina Campaign in 1862. They also gave Vietnam five ships with cannons and rifles. The most important terms of the treaty seem to have been understood differently by the parties. France recognized \\"the sovereignty of the king of Annam and his complete independence from any foreign power\\" (la souveraineté du roi d'Annam et son entière independence vis-à-vis de toute puissance étrangère). The foreign power in view was China, of which Vietnam was a tributary. France also offered to provide military assistance against any enemy if Vietnam requested, in exchange for which Vietnam would confirm its foreign policy to that of France. Taken together, these terms amounted to Vietnamese renunciation of Chinese suzerainty and acceptance of a French protectorate, although the latter term was not used. Neither Vietnam nor China appears to have undersood these terms in this way. Neither did France seek to take advantage of them before 1879. The governor of Cochinchina, Admiral Marie Jules Dupré, who had authorized both Garnier's disastrous expedition and Philastre's cleaning up operation, requested his own recall soon after and brought a copy of the treaty back to France. His main concern had been recognition of the 1867 occupation effected by his predecessor, Admiral Pierre-Paul de La Grandière, and this had been accomplished. France requested Vietnam to inform China of the treaty, but neither power did so immediately. In May 1875, the French chargé-d'affaires in Peking informed Prince Gong in a note in which he also requested the Chinese government to stop armed bandits entering Tonkin from its territory and to open a port for trade along the Red River in Yunnan. At the time the Black Flags, an armed group of Chinese, was in control of the upper Red River, rendering the clause opening it to trade inoperative. In his response, Prince Gong, aware of the implications of the treaty, restated China's claim to suzerainty over Vietnam.McAleavy, Black Flags, pp. 165–167.

History The Chevrolet Step- van was a parcel van made in the chassis of a Chevrolet truck however from 1973 they were built in a unibody chassis instead of a truck one. First Generation The first generation was a parcel van version of the AK Series truck built from 1941 to 1949, it was a tougher version than the normal pickup truck it was based on and could haul more things than it's pickup counterpart. The 1941 AK Series parcel van. Despite the Chevrolet Advance Design being released in 1947/1948, the AK Series parcel van continued production until 1949. The parcel vans can be confused with the Cab-Over Chevrolet trucks and vans. The reason the parcel vans continued production until 1949 is because of their popularity as it could haul more things than the normal pickup truck counterpart it was based on. Second Generation From 1950 to 1953 Chevrolet started continuing the parcel vans versions of their pickup trucks billed as stronger and more capable versions of their pickup trucks, the parcel van was usually made in the chassis of a 3800 version of the Advance-Design. Chevrolet didn't make many versions of the Advance-Design parcel van. as the parcel van body was very tall and caused aerodynamic failures. The parcel van used the same engine as it's pickup truck counterpart, unlike the AK Series parcel van. The Advance-Design parcel van. Third Generation The third generation was made in the chassis of the Volkswagen Type 1 van with the grille and body that was reminiscent of the Chevrolet Task Force series, the back doors were almost the same as the previous but the aerodynamic issues were fixed. The third generation. The third generation improved the sales of the Chevrolet Step van. It was somewhat shorter than the previous generations but had more cargo space in it's back than the AK Series and Advance Design parcel vans. This generation introduced a cab-over style to the parcel van style. Fourth Generation The fourth-generation was almost just a facelifted version of the third generation with some upgraded components and this time it was made in a unibody chassis than a previous used one, that generation was not as long as the previous ones but was taller. It also featured a somewhat redesigned style and grille, the back doors remained the same for the most part, the headlights remained the same. It was not a cab-over truck and featured a somewhat longer bonnet than the previous generation. The Fourth-Generation. Fifth Generation That was the last generation Chevrolet step-van made in a unibody chassis like the previous generation, that generation was also made in some European countries, unlike the previous generations. The fifth generation of the step-van. That generation started production from 1968 to 1973 and as of today, there are no more generations of the step-van, at least as for now. The stop of the production of the step-van could be because of the popularity of box vans, as they became more popular than step-vans.

Part of a series of paintings on the theme of ballroom dancing painted by Brack in the late 1960s, the painting depicts two ballroom dancers - a man and a woman - in a dance competition. Composition Ballroom dancing was an activity that attracted Brack by means of its \\"absurdity ... a natural activity, such as dance, [converted] into a demanding and challenging ritual.\\" As part of his research Brack attended the 1967 World Ballroom Dancing Championships held at Festival Hall in Melbourne. He also collected photographs of ballroom dancing and subscribed to Australasian Dancing Times - a ballroom dancing magazine. The painting shows the \\"lissom dancers in their richly decorated dresses and high-heeled shoes\\". It also includes a self- portrait of the artist in the top-left corner, \\"more vulnerable than the rest, dancing alone without a partner.\\" Reception This painting and his other ballroom dancing works were first exhibited in 1970. While Brack thought this exhibition was his best work - better even than his 1955 paintings such as Collins St., 5 pm - sales were slow and critical reaction was mixed. Many critics felt that the \\"paintings were absurd and the colours jarring\\". However the works are now among the artist's most popular and sought-after.

Built into a cave in the Pontic Mountains, the monastery sits high above ground, up a steep flight of stairs.

It resembles the famous Sumela Monastery, which Turkish sources estimate was completed in the late 4th century.Sümela Monastery (Archived from September 29, 2007). Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Sumela is also a former Greek Orthodox monastery built into a cliff. Hulusi Güleç, the director of culture and tourism in Giresun, says the monastery was first used during Roman occupation of Anatolia. According to him, early Christians secretly practiced within the monastery during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Virgin Mary Monastery lies in the borders of Şebinkarahisar District, a subdivision of Giresun Province. In the 1880s, the area around Şebinkarahisar had a little over 8,000 Pontian Greeks.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 136-137 Every year between the 26th and 28th of August, Greeks from nearby visited the monastery to celebrate and worship. However, the Greek/Turkish population exchange severely decreased the Pontian Greek presence in the region. The 1939 Erzincan earthquake made the abandoned monastery inaccessible, after which it fell into great disrepair. Restoration and tourism In the early 2010s, the four-story monastery underwent restoration work. This was an effort to make the monastery into a tourist attraction, especially while Sumela Monastery, another tourist draw, was closed for repairs. Both Anadolu Agency, a state-run Turkish news source, and an independently run paper report that the monastery has recently attracted the Pontian Greek diaspora. Forty residents of Kavala, Greece, descendants of Pontians forced out of Sebinkarahisar during the population exchange, visited Virgin Mary Monastery in 2015.

Throughout his childhood and early adulthood, Russell often had scrapes with the law, mostly involving thefts and burglaries. Despite this, he was popular with the ladies, frequenting cocktail lounges around Seattle in search of hook-ups with women. Murders Between June and August 1990, Russell would sexually assault and murder three women in Seattle. In each case, he horribly mutilated and violated the corpses, posing them in various embarrasing positions before leaving the crime scene. * Mary Anne Pohlreich (27) - a resident of Redmond, Pohlreich's nude body was found behind a Bellevue restaurant's parking lot on June 23rd.

That ring was later found at a pawn shop. Russell pleaded innocent to all charges, and when questioned in telephone interviews, he admitted to having books on Ted Bundy, but denied being a fan of his. In spite of his claims, he was found guilty of the three murders in October 1991 by Justice Patricia Aitken, showing no emotion when the sentence was read out.

Around 1907, Werner Heuser travelled to Rome and met up with his brother-in- laws Karli Sohn-Rethel, and Otto Sohn-Rethel, and artists Karl Hofer, Hermann Haller and Maurice Sterne.  Career  In 1919, Heuser was one of the first members of the Young Rhineland (Das Junge Rheinland) artists' group, alongside Heinrich Nauen, Adolf Uzarski, Arthur Kaufmann, Carlo Mense, Walter Ophey, and architect Wilhelm Kreis. In 1926, he was appointed to the Düsseldorf Art Academy, as a professor of drawing and composition. Some of his students included Herbert Zangs, Else Harney, Georg Meistermann,Inge Herold, \\"Meistermann, Georg\\", AKL, vol. 88, Berlin and Boston, 2016, pp. 535-536. Caspar Walter Rauh, among others.  Entartete Kunst exhibit  Between 1927 until 1937, Germany was experienced a rise in Nazi Party power. In 1927, the National Socialist Society for German Culture was formed, in order to halt the \\"corruption of art\\" and inform the people about the relationship between race and art through pseudoscientific racist theories. Starting in 1933, the group labeled modern artwork and artists as \\"Jewish,\\" \\"degenerate,\\" and \\"Bolshevik\\". In 1937, the Nazi officials purged German museums and removed the art they considered to be degenerate and formed a special exhibit of the work called, Entartete Kunst. Entartete Kunst featured 650 works of art and travelled throughout Germany, and was popular with viewers. Heuser was one of the artists in the exhibition and he was labeled as a \\"degenerate\\". That same year, 1937, Heuser's contract work as a professor was not extended.  World War II and post-war  During World War II he initially was staying in Sanary-sur-Mer, followed by a stay in Allgäu and Breisgau. In 1943, the Sohn- Rethel home at Goltsteinstraße 23 in Düsseldorf, where he lived and worked, was fire bombed destroying his art work and his art collection. He followed his family to Bollschweil by 1945. After the end of National Socialist rule, he returned to Düsseldorf and by 1 November 1945 he resumed teaching. He was appointed as Director of the Düsseldorf Art Academy in 7 January 1946, and by 31 January 1946, the school was rebuilt and reopened.  Death and legacy  Werner Heuser died of heart failure in Düsseldorf on June 11, 1964 and is buried at Nordfriedhof Düsseldorf cemetery. His daughter Ursula Benser (1915–2001) was a painter, and she was married to photographer Walther Benser. His work is included in various collections, including the Library of Congress.

Licensed Foster care agency filed suit against the city of Philadelphia closed intake and new referrals and did not offer a new contract to the agency for the agency failure to complete with the all-comers or non-discrimination policy in the contract. The agency refused on religious grounds to provided service to married same-sex couples.

Background The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia runs the Catholic Social Services which has operated a foster care agency in Philadelphia for over a 100 years. The city of Philadelphia learned that Catholic Social Services refused to license married same-sex couples to become foster parents. The Catholic Social Service and four of its licensed families sued the City of Philadelphia when they refuse to renew the agency's contract.

Deciding upon classroom arrangement is typically done at the beginning of a school year as a part of classroom management. The decision to change the classroom environment is thought to affect the student engagement, focus and participation. Some research suggests that seating location is related to academic achievement and classroom participation and class arrangement has the ability to affect the communal environment within the room.  Arrangement patterns  Classroom arrangements can follow different patterns such as: * Traditional (students facing the instructor) * Stadium Seating (or Angled Rows with Desks Touching) * Modified U (or Horseshoe) * Groups (or Pods, Teams) * Combination (desks in various positions) * Roundtable (students and instructors facing the center)  History  Around the turn of the 20th century, new education mandates and laws banning child labor rapidly increase school enrollments, standardizing facility design.

She was active from 1898 to 1944 and received prestigious commissions to paint vice regal representatives, prominent members of society and celebrities in Melbourne and later Sydney.  Biography  Ada Clara Whiting (1859-1953) was born Ada Clara Cherry in Hobart, Tasmania. She was the second eldest of five children of the English-born photographer, artist and miniaturist George Cherry and Mary Ann Mathilda (née James). After the early death of her parents, Whiting moved to Geelong with her siblings, where she attended the Geelong Technological School and School of Drawing. In 1874 she was awarded first prize for figure drawing and in 1879 she received prizes for flowers in nature and shells. Whiting's work was also included in the Melbourne School of Design's exhibitions at the Academy of Arts in 1877. Whiting obtained work with the photographic studio Johnstone, O'Shannessy and Co, hand-colouring photographs. She married photographer Saville Whiting in 1888. Her husband had also been employed at Johnstone, O'Shannessy and Co. After a difficult marriage and two children, they eventually divorced in 1899, with Whiting citing \\"desertion and habitual drunkenness\\" as the causes. Whiting had already found a studio and was working to support herself and her children as early as 1893.  Achieving notability  Whiting's father had known Arthur Streeton and it is possible Streeton suggested she try her hand at miniatures.She acquired the skills necessary including \\"stippling with a camel hair brush\\" and she achieved notability, which was commented on regularly during her career, when one of her early miniatures was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1900. Painting miniatures was time-consuming, but Whiting was known for working quickly and her watercolour miniatures on ivory were greatly admired. She usually only required a small number of sittings and was adept at painting from photographs, including portraits of people who had died. The latter sort of commissions were quite common. In 1900, she was exhibiting at the Albert Street Galleries in Fitzroy and her miniatures were regarded as being worthy of the name \\"miniature\\" and were regarded as \\"daintily pretty\\". By 1901, Whiting had established her studio on Collins Street, Melbourne. Her success at the Royal Academy resulted in a steady stream of commissions from influential people, and her skill in creating miniatures was widely recognised. In 1902 it was noted in the Melbourne newspapers she was undertaking a number of commissions, mostly of children from prominent families. In 1904 the then National Art Gallery, Sydney (now known at the Art Gallery of NSW) was exhibiting a small set of her miniatures and in 1905 acquired three of these, including one of Miss Ruby Webb for their collection. In 1909, Whiting was invited to submit works for the Federal Art Exhibition in South Australia, with her four miniature pictures being regarded as \\"all that can be desired in this delicate branch of art\\". From 1915 Whiting continued to exhibit and receive prestigious commissions. with regular complimentary references in the newspapers of the day such as \\"Mrs Whiting ... stands at the head of her profession in the miniature branch of portraiture\\". These regular references would have been an important part of maintaining her reputation as a skilled miniature portrait painter in the minds of potential clients. She regularly visited her son Saville in Sydney and received commissions to paint members of the wealthy Australia Hordern dynasty, as well as the daughter of the NSW Governor. Whiting received many prestigious commissions to paint miniatures including the great Victorian art benefactor Alfred Felton and the Earl of Linlithgow.  Whiting and Dame Nellie Melba  1903 miniature of Dame Nellie Melba As well as the many miniatures quite regularly completed of and for Dame Nellie Melba, in 1903 Whiting had completed two further miniature of Melba, who was regarded as a close friend A newspaper columnist for the Arena- Sun, Melbourne described Whiting as being 'the most accomplished of the Melbourne practitioners of the art\\" with one of her miniatures to be given to one of Melba's friends, Miss Violet Clarke, the daughter of the then State Governor. In 1904 Whiting received a message from Melba in Paris, asking her to paint her father, Mr David Mitchell. Despite his initial objection to sitting for a portrait, it was quickly completed and was dispatched to Melba in London. Melba regarded the miniature as her \\"dearest treasure\\". Melba also commissioned a miniature of author Beverley Nichols, which she took to London for his mother. One of the miniatures painted by Whiting, completed in 1919, was of Melba in one of her famous tiaras wearing \\"a lace gown with camellias which she had first worn when she performed La Traviata.\\" Whiting did not ever travel abroad, despite being encouraged by clients such as Melba who offered influential introductions and the arts writer for one of Melbourne's newspapers expressed the wish that Whiting had had \\"a wider field of action\\". Melba continued her patronage and when Melba was interviewed by The Argus, Melbourne on the eve of her departure for London in 1919 she spoke of her friendship with Whiting saying \\"I have had some miniatures painted by Mrs Whiting and they are very beautiful. She talks of coming to London. I hope she will.\\" Whiting also completed a miniature of her grand-daughter Pamela which was \\"a dainty bijou carried off in Melba's suitcase like a mascot\\".  Later years  Despite the waning of interest in the miniature, Whiting continued to receive commissions and regularly exhibited, with mentions of her participation in the annual exhibitions of the Victorian Society of Artists in 1925, 1926, 1930 and 1933. In 1934 Whiting was inviting to send her work to the Paris Salon. Whiting included her portrait of \\"Australia's loveliest girl\\" Miss Jessica Harcourt. She had mostly given up painting miniatures when her eye sight started to trouble her, although she used a magnifying glass for commissions and completed a miniature in 1944. Whiting was painting larger works, mostly flowers in oils almost until her death in 1953. Whiting died at the home of her son Saville Whiting in North Brighton, Melbourne.

President Tsai Ing- wen, Vice-president Lai Ching-te and Premier Su Tseng-chang visited Lee at the hospital on 29 July 2020. On 30 July, after a pastor's last prayer and accompanied by his family, Lee died multiple of organ failure and septic shock at Taipei Veterans General Hospital at 7:24pm, aged 97 (98 in some sources, by East Asian age reckoning).  Memorial  President Tsai Ing-wen instructed a memorial to be set up at the Taipei Guest House for the public from 1 to 16 August 2020 and the national flag to be flown at half-mast for three days starting noon of 31 July. On 9 August, Yoshirō Mori, former prime minister of Japan, led a cross-party delegation and conveyed to President Tsai condolences from current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before paying tribute to Lee at the Taipei Guest House, where he expressed gratitude for Lee's contributions to Japan–Taiwan relations and his support to Japan's post-war recovery. While not designated as an envoy, Mori is said to act on behalf of Abe. Mori had approved Lee's application for medical treatment in Japan during his premiership, against Beijing's protests and his cabinet's concerns. On 12 August, Alex Azar, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and the highest-level US official to visit Taiwan since 1979, paid his respects to Lee at the Taipei Guest House. On 14 August, a woman, identified as retired entertainer , vandalised the memorial by throwing a balloon filled with red paint at Lee's portrait. The memorial ended with Lee Chun-yi, deputy secretary general of the presidential office, leading the staff to bow three times to Lee's portrait. More than 43,000 people visited during the 16-day period.

In practice, the president appointed 21 members (in case of a passing president) to form a funeral committee, which arranges the funeral in the rite modelled after the national burial. On 3 August, President Tsai announced a 32-member funeral committee, comprising Lai Ching-te (convenor), Lien Chan, Vincent Siew, Su Tseng-chang, Yu Shyi-kun, Hsu Tzong-li, Wu Jin- lin, Chen Chu, Wang Jin-pyng, , Hsu Shui-teh, Chien Foo, David Lee, Wu Po- hsiung, Huang Kun-huei, Wellington Koo, James Soong, Peng Ming-min, Koo Kwang- ming, Morris Chang, , Yuan Tseh Lee, Perng Fai-nan, , Chen Po-chih, Chiang Chi-chen, Ko Wen-je, Chiu Hsien-chih, Liu Yi-te, Hsu Kuo-yung, Joseph Wu and Yen Teh-fa. The list is noted for its inclusion of incumbent and former vice presidents, incumbent and former heads of the five government branches, senior government officials, party leaders across the Blue-Green camps and entrepreneurs. As Lee was a Christian, the presidential office delegated the preparation of his funeral services to the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, in accordance with the wish of his family, therefore the erecting of memorial altars with incense and candles were not utilized. Although Lee had said he wanted his ashes to be scattered on Jade Mountain, his family agreed to strike a balance between the institution of the state and the wish of the family, so that his thoughts \\"\\" and \\"Integrity and naturality\\" could be implemented. His younger daughter Annie also described Lee's last wishes as the strengthening of Taiwan's democracy and the unity of the Taiwanese people, and expressed a desire to demonstrate these through the arrangements of his funeral.  Funeral service and cremation  Lee's funeral procession making a lap around the Presidential Office Building At 6:36am on 14 August, the casket carrying Lee's remains was moved from Taipei Veterans General Hospital to , where Lee's private funeral took place behind closed doors. At the start of ceremony, the bell was rung for 21 times, in an adaptation of the 21-gun salute in Western state funerals. The service was presided over by pastors Iap Khe-siong and Ng Chhun-seng. During the service, the Taiwanese Hokkien version of Lee's favourite hymns \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"Rock of Ages, cleft for me\\" were sung. Around 100 people, including 60 family members, some government officials and clergymen, attended the service but Lee's widow, Tseng Wen-hui, was absent over concern for her health. After the funeral service, the funeral procession made a symbolic lap around the Presidential Office Building, where crowds lined up to pay their final tribute. David Lee, secretary general of the presidential office, and Wellington Koo Li-hsiung, secretary general of the National Security Council, headed the presidential office staff and military officers in a guard of honour. The cremation took place at Taipei City Second Funeral Parlor. Lee's granddaughter Lee Kun-yi carried the urn containing his ashes back to Lee's residence.  Farewell service  At 9am of 19 September, the farewell service (memorial service) was held at the Main Chapel in Aletheia University, which was situated in Tamsui in New Taipei City; members of public could register to attend at the chapel and concert hall of the neighbouring . The title of the ceremony was \\"I do it with the People in my heart\\", taken from his speech during his visit to Cornell University in 1995. The ceremony was broadcast live.

Krach, US Under Secretary of State and Yoshiro Mori, former prime minister of Japan. Hiroyasu Izumi, chief representative of Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association Taipei Office, read an eulogy on behalf of Shinzo Abe, the now former Japanese prime minister, who expressed respect to Lee for instilling universal values in Taiwan and forging the friendship between the two countries. In a pre-recorded video, the 14th Dalai Lama shared his memories with Lee and praised him for his commitment to democracy and freedom and preservation of Chinese culture in Taiwan.

Following the wish of the family, the ceremony was not open to public, with only family members and top level government officials in attendance. The national flags at government and public facilities were flown at half-mast on that day. At around 8:20am, Lee's family members, with Lee's granddaughter Kun-yi and grandson-in-law carrying the cremation urn and the portrait, departed from his family residence and reached the military cemetery an hour later. They were greeted by President Tsai, Vice President Lai, Presidential Office Secretary-General David Lee and Deputy Secretary-General Lee Chun-yi, Interior Minister Hsu Kuo-yung and Defense Minister Yen Teh-fa. The ceremony was officiated by Pastor Ng Chhun- seng and Elder Chueh Chang-meng of Che-lam Presbyterian Church. In Ng's sermon, he encouraged the Taiwanese people to be inspired by Lee's \\"Jade Mountain spirit\\" and to dedicate themselves to their home Taiwan. The interment was followed by a three-volley salute by the Military Police Honour Guard and the \\"Last Post\\" played by the military band.

When she retired after thirty years she was said to be the last.  Life  Bultitude was born in Hardwick in Norfolk. She came from a large Wesleyan Methodist family and they were poor. When she was thirteen her father died and the family moved to Norwich to find work. She went hungry. She had not ate when she met Samuel Atterby and had a spiritual event. He was a Primitive Methodist, but she did not formally join that denomination until 1829 when another minister, John Smith, visited Norwich. Bultitude's talents for preaching were spotted and she was given \\"a note\\" which gave her the church's authority to preach. She did not find it easy although she noted that in all of her time preaching she only failed to turn up on two occasions. In both cases it had been due to rain which meant that turnout would be poor and it was unwise to preach outside in torrential rain. Male preachers were poorly paid and women preachers were paid just half of that amount. When she was preaching at Soham at 1847 she was criticised for the poor quality of her dress. In reply she noted that even if she spent all of her money on clothes then she would not be able to meet any standard of smart attire. She retired in 1862. There were at least 40 women preachers but Bultitude was the last. In 1881 she was living in a small street in Norwich. She was indulgent towards her drunken younger brother James who lived with his wife in the same street. He made a living as a fishmonger. She later moved to another small house. Bultitude died in Heigham in 1890 after a long gruelling illness.

He was a 57-year-old professor and department head at the Central Committee Academy for Social Sciences (\\"Akademie für Gesellschaftswissenschaften beim ZK der SED\\") in Berlin when street protesters broke through the Berlin Wall in November 1989, after which many of his contemporaries rapidly disappeared into obscurity. Harry Nick emerged as a robust exponent of \\"economic literacy\\". He had always been prepared to argue his case, even when his evaluations were out of harmony with some party dogma of the moment: he spent the final decades of his life as a controversialist and media pundit, happy to explain what went wrong with the \\"socialist experiment\\" that was East Germany, but trenchant in his advocacy of core economic principals such as the central importance of shared \\"public\\" ownership of the means of production.  Life = Provenance and early years  Harry Nick was born in Borowo, a short distance outside Łódź. The region had reverted to Polish control after 1918 but remained multi-ethnic throughout the 1930s. Nevertheless, even as a small child Harry Nick was, during 1939, intensely aware of the seemingly sudden erupting tensions between ethnic German speakers and ethnic Polish speakers. Harry Nick was from the ethnic German community, and would never forget the time when two friends from the Polish side of the growing ethnic divide told him, \\"You are a Schwob. Also, our parents have forbidden us from playing with you.\\" His father was a forestry worker. In January/February 1945 the family were driven west by the ethnic cleansing of the time, settling in Sylda, a village in the rural Mansfelder mountain region south of Magdeburg. Nick completed his schooling in 1951 at the senior school (Oberschule) in nearby Hettstedt. During this time he was also a member of the local leadership team of the party-backed Free German Youth. On leaving school he worked for four months at the steel mill in Hettstedt as a \\"rod puller\\".  Student years  Between 1951 and 1954 he studied Industrial Economics and Organisation at the College for Economic Planning (\\"Hochschule für Planökonomie\\" - as it was known at that time) in Berlin-Karlshorst. He combined his studies with work as a research assistant on Marxism–Leninism. The topic for his degree dissertation was \\"The Nature of the Socio-economic changes in Czechoslovakia after the Second World War\\". After receiving his degree he stayed on at the college as an assistant at the college Institute for Political Economy, in the section devoted to the Political Economy of socialism, progressing to the position of a senior assistant over the next few years. He received his doctorate in 1959 for work on the accumulation of investment capital for livestock accommodation in large agricultural co-operatives. By 1962, he was also delivering lectures.  Post-graduate progression  It was in 1962 that Harry Nick moved on to the Central Committee Academy for Social Sciences (\\"Akademie für Gesellschaftswissenschaften beim ZK der SED\\"), initially as a researcher and, from 1964, also as a lecturer at the Academy's Institute for Social Sciences. In 1965 he confirmed that his career lay in the academic sector by obtaining his Habilitation (higher degree) in return for a piece of work entitled \\"Der Fondsvorschuss als besondere Aufwandsart\\", which concerned alternative investment modalities. In 1967 he accepted a full professorship in Political Economy.  Professor  Nick remained in charge of research in respect of \\"Economic and Social Problems resulting from Academic and Technical Advances\\" at the Institute for Political Economy till 1990. Principal areas of work included the Economics of Funding new enterprises and Economic Accounting. It may have been out of respect for his unwavering commitment to basic socialist principals that between 1967 and 1990 Harry Nick was able to publish a succession of articles drawing attention to problems afflicting East Germany which, in his judgement, called for urgent economic reforms and remedies. Among his more important published contributions were \\"Technical Revolution and the Economics of Funding Manufacturing\\" (1967) \\"Society and Business under Socialism\\" (1970), and \\"The Economic and Social Impact of Academic and Technical Progress\\" (1986). During the early 1960s party leaders were increasingly desperate to slow down or even reverse the widening gap in economic performance and general prosperity between socialist East Germany and capitalist West Germany. One response was to try and restrict economic emigration from east to west. Another involved economic reforms at home which would focus more on profitability and decentralising decision making. The so- called New Economic System was formally launched in 1963. Western sources tend to see it as a belated acceptance of western-style economic liberal economics. The way in which it was implemented (or was not) during the 1960s and 1970s suggest it was no such thing. Walter Ulbricht seems always to have been, at most, a deeply reluctant convert to inconvenient economic truths. Harry Nick engaged with commitment in the debates surrounding the New Economic System, and what it should mean in terms of economic planning and management of the national economy. He saw and articulated an acute need for \\"economic reform in the context of genuine socialism\\". To the extent that his vision was never realised, he continued to articulate it, appropriately updated, long after the increasingly obvious bankruptcy of the East German economy had effectively put an end to the East German dictator-state during 1989/90.  Changes and reunification  The Central Committee Academy for Social Sciences closed in 1990 at around the same time as the one-party dictatorship collapsed. For Harry Nick, still aged only 58, this triggered both enforced retirement and the start of a new career. He remained engaged both politically and as a journalist. In 1989 not everyone anticipated reunification with the same bull- headed clarity as Chancellor Kohl, but there was a widespread acceptance within the political class that as the winds of Glasnost blew across from, of all places, Moscow, the SED's days as the country's perpetually ruling party were numbered. During the first party of 1990 the old East German ruling party embarked on a lengthy restructuring programme in order to prepare itself for a democratic future. One of the first visible changes involved a new name for the party. Harry Nick joined a series of working groups set up within the new Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), producing reports for the party executive on economic policy. He became a member of the \\"Economy and Democracy\\" forum and for many years participated in the party's Marxist Forum. Post-unification Nick was, in addition, a respected member of the Leibnitz Society. Between 1997 and 2012 Harry Nick contributed regularly to Neues Deutschland on various economics topics. In his final article he wrote that developments in [what had previously been] East Germany since 1990 could \\"not be understood without also understanding that the defining maxim of the market economy is the same as that of a common robber - grab as much as you can\\".  Looking back  But it should not be assumed that he ever became uncritical of government economic management between 1949 and 1989. Although it was common at the time and subsequently to describe the East German economy as a \\"planned economy\\", reality was frequently a grotesque absence of planning. Economic policy certainly operated according to a powerfully dirigiste midel, but attempts at micro-management and other intrventions by politicians were frequently mutually contradictory and generally based on short-term often personal considetations. Nick lived through the timid economic reforms of the early 1960s and their abrupt abandonment by the leadership. What made the matter worse, he later recalled, was that as the crisis for \\"real socialism\\" became ever clearer, there was no political response. By 1989 the German Democratic Republic really had reached the end of the road, in terms of its growing technological deficit and the widening shortfall between supply and demand. In 2012 Nick spelled out his verdict that the \\"socialist attempt [had] not passed its historical acid test\\". A recurring theme of Harry Nick's later work is the economic and political \\"failure of Eastern European socialism\\". If ever the attempt to create a true socialist state were to be attempted [in Germany] again, the \\"democratic process [must be sustained] even while the rule of the bourgeoisie is overcome\\".  Personal  Harry Nick was married with, by December 1967 six children, of whom four were boys.  Honours and awards (selection)  Compared to some of his colleagues who were more overtly industrious and / or more willing to follow official interpretations of party dogma unquestioningly, Nick himself found this a relatively modest haul by the standards of the time and place. He did not enjoy travel privileges, and made his forst foreign trip - to Austria - only in 1989. Even then the necessary permissions were received only as a result of what Harry Nick himself described in a semi-autobographical book published in 2003, as \\"some kind of a tacit oversight\\" (\\"... eine Art stillschweigendes Versehen\\").

The temple is at the hill near the confluence of Bhariavi Ganga, Tamrabarni and Sundari rivers. The temple has statues of five goddesses -Barahi, Chamunda, Bhramayani, Indrayani and Mahakali. There are other 8 metal idols of various god and goddesses. The idols of Chamunda, Chandika, Nusing and Baisnav were stolen by 2029 BS. According to the legend, a king named Bikram Shahi ruled the area and the temple now where it stands was his palace. His workes when beat rice in okhal, they found the rice was doubled. This mystery led the king to excavate the area in around 1410 BS. He found a statue of Bhagwati standing in a Sadkon Yantra. Many butterflies came out of the excavated pit. One of the butterflies went to sit in the location where the current temple lies. When human tried to catch the butterfly, it transformed into stone. The first priest was Bistas appointed by king Bikram Shahi. Later Chaulagai, Sinkhadas, Neupane and Upadhya Bhramins were appointed as priests.

The book is India’s first boxing fiction novel and revolves around two fallen souls who need to defeat their inner demons to become the people they were destined to be.  Plot  Sometimes it takes a single moment to destroy it all. For twenty four year old boxer Karan Pratap Singh, who is on the brink of winning the Heavy weight Boxing Championship, that moment arrives during the last round of the Boxing finals, when he nearly bludgeons his opponent to death in an uncontrolled fit of rage. In that fateful moment he loses everything he’s worked for and is banned from boxing for four years. The four best years of his sporting career, along with his coach and mentor Jerry Fernandez, are lost forever to a rage that he cannot explain. His fall from glory seems fueled by ruthless arrogance and an anger management problem. That, however, is simply symptomatic of a deeper issue. Buried under layers of his fractured subconscious lies a childhood secret, a demon he needs to vanquish, but cannot come to terms with. Karan must vanquish these demons to become the boxer he was meant to be. He must atone and do what it takes to get back into the ring. Parallelly we meet Sonia Kapoor, a beautiful and volatile young woman with a dark secret that torments her at night but a secret that she seemingly feels no guilt for. Sonia comes to Mumbai on a stormy night with the hope that she, along with her secret will disappear in the bustling megalopolis. She hopes that Mumbai will hide her and never judge her. But just as a leopard cannot change its spots, nor can the volatile Sonia. And soon her past catches up with her. When fate throws Karan and Sonia together in Mumbai, their inner demons and pasts collide and stir up trouble in their fragile and uncertain present. Is it possible to outrun one’s past? And is redemption really possible without forgiveness?  Book launch and film adaptation  The boxing redemption saga will be adapted into a Hindi film. Dancing with Demons was launched and the film announced on November 18, 2014 in an event held in Mumbai which was attended by Bollywood actor Arunoday Singh and filmmaker Sudhir Mishra.  Critical reception  The book is critically acclaimed by several Indian authors. News 18 described the book as \\"it's promising and keeps you entertained throughout.\\" Writing in Deccan Chronicle Anjana Basu states \\"a first for its boxing background and for its romantic pair who are so at odds that it seems unlikely that they will ever manage to get together and find true love in a world of lies.\\" She further adds \\"Strongly visual and action packed, it’s hardly surprising that the author plans to make it into a film.\\"  References  Category:2014 Indian novels Category:Indian novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in India Category:Novels about boxing Category:Indian boxing films Category:Sports novels ","title":"Dancing with Demons"},{"id":"64943520","text":"Banda Nkwanta Mosque is located in the West Gonja District in the formally Northern region of Ghana.

It appeared after the 2009 Cyclone Klaus led to increased deposition of sediment and lies near the historic Cordouan Lighthouse. It is regarded as an important emerging ecosystem and efforts have been made to protect the island from human intrusion. Officially it lies within the department of Gironde but in 2015 was occupied by a group claiming it for Charente-Maritime.  2009 appearance  The island, known as (French: island with no name), appeared after Cyclone Klaus struck the Gironde estuary on 23 January 2009. A European windstorm that progressed through France, Spain and Italy killing 26 people and causing widespread destruction, the cyclone caused rapid coastal erosion in Charente- Maritime. Some of the sediment accumulated in the estuary, adjacent to the Corduan platform, the remains of an earlier limestone island since lost to erosion. The platform, partly exposed at low tide, is the site of France's oldest standing lighthouse, the 1611 Cordouan Lighthouse. The sediment augmented an existing sand bank approximately east of the lighthouse until it became a permanent fixture, visible at high tide. Soon after it formed the island, lying at the boundary between the estuary and the Atlantic Ocean, was measured at above high tide level and some in the intertidal zone. Initially unclaimed by any local municipality the island came to be known as but was also named by locals after the 1875 Jules Verne novel. It was considered possible at the time that the island would disappear as quickly as it had appeared, though some experts considered it could become permanent.  Later history  The island in 2010 The island offered ecologists an opportunity to study the development of a new ecosystem by colonising species, a rare experience in Europe as these are usually associated with new volcanic islands. Within months of its appearance the first plants, insects and gulls had arrived on the island and by 2010 12 plant species and 30 species of invertebrates were present, of which around a third were considered well established. The estuary is rich in marine life and lies on an important bird migration route. Quantities of sea rocket on the island provide sustenance for flies, who are preyed upon by invertebrates who also feed on debris left by the gulls. Spiders, blown across by the wind, and ants, travelling by driftwood, have also been recorded on the island. The fragile ecosystem is vulnerable to trampling and has been placed at risk by human landings on the island. Several music parties, attended by hundreds of people, have disturbed nesting birds and the island has been used as a landing site by the local parachute club. Plans were made in 2011 to place the island under protection as part of a maritime conservation zone. The island was since brought within the commune of Le Verdon-sur-Mer in the Gironde department for administrative purposes. The island survived Cyclone Xynthia in February 2010 but lost of its surface area and was moved east. On 5 October 2015 a group of 50 people landed on the island and claimed it for the department of Charente-Maritime. The group renamed the island \\"Tahiti\\" and an aircraft chartered to tow a banner reading \\"\\" (\\"Tahiti island belongs to the Charentais\\"). The flag of the department was erected and the official song of the department sung. The island was recognised as a hazardous destination by the port authorities in nearby Royan, Charente-Maritime. A notice to mariners was issued in 2017 regarding the island and signs were erected on it requesting that people do not land on it.

Born in Ta'if to a Sharifian family, al-Awni completed his BA, MA and PhD in Sharia at the College of Da'wah and Fundamentals of Religion, Umm al-Qura University, where he later became Associate Professor. He was appointed as a member of the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia, serving two terms between 12 April 2005 and 10 January 2013. A student of Nasir al-Din al-Albani, his research focuses on hadith studies. Al-Awni advocates for a reformed Wahhabism which he envisages as a \\"correctionist movement\\".  Theological views  Al-Awni argues that the Wahhabi definition of worship (ibadah) is incorrect, stating it is a \\"specific action of the heart\\" and emphasizing the importance of intentions. Therefore, he says, they have misunderstood what constitutes shirk in worship and wrongly takfir others, including Shias. He also argues for limited freedom of thought, where people would be free to hold views as long as they do not encourage criminal acts, exploit ignorance or undermine the \\"fundamentals of religion\\". According to him, this would allow for \\"true dialogue\\" that would, among other benefits, encourage fruitful debate and correct unreasonable beliefs. Without this, he states, hypocrisy becomes widespread and one can not achieve true certainty in their faith as they cannot know if it is built upon secure arguments. In addition, al-Awni opines that an Islamic society can accommodate both religions he considers to be revealed by God, such as Christianity, and those he considers man-made. In al-Awni's view, the doctrine of al-Wala' wal- Bara' is fundamental to belief, but does not preclude acting judiciously and humanely to unbelievers who are peaceful toward Muslims.  Views on ISIS  On 3 August 2014, al-Awni published an essay entitled \\"The Lazy Scholars\\", in which he criticised the Saudi religious establishment for \\"lazily\\" responding to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He also alleged their quarrel with the group was political rather than theological, claiming their approach to takfir is identical. In an interview for Al-Hayat later that month, he suggested that \\"extremist\\" views within a classical Wahhabi work, ad-Durar as-Saniyyah, should be corrected. Soon afterwards, the Council of Senior Scholars dismissed the notion that extremism stemmed from such texts. In response to his criticism of the group, ISIS declared al-Awni an apostate and called for his killing through their magazine, Dabiq.

Illustration by Coert DuBois from Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods by William T. Cox. In American folklore, the hugag is a fearsome critter resembling a large terrestrial mammal, quadruped, with an extensive upper-lip, preventing it from grazing, and joint-less legs preventing it from lying down. Name usage The word hugag well predates its usage as a term to describe a mythical creature. It appears as a variant spelling of hewgag, a woodwind instrument akin to a kazoo. For example, the June 20, 1846 issue of the American Republican and Baltimore Daily Clipper reads, \\"My friends and fellow-countrymen—awake, arise! for the Philistines are upon you. Strike the tunjo! blow the hugag! whistle the fife, and chastise the drum! Your lives, your loaves, and liberties are in danger.\\" However, the word also appears in non-English works. The term is referenced in a German text as a transliteration of an Arabic name in 1861. As well, Hugag also appears as a name of a mine located at Republican Mountain, in Colorado, discovered in 1870. The first mention of the hugag to refer to an imaginary animal, while also establishing it as a myth among loggers, is found in the 1900 book In the Limestone Valley: Pen Pictures of Early Days in Western Wisconsin by S.W. Brown. Albeit spelled \\"hew-gag,\\" the creature, as described by Brown, had round feet surrounded on all sides by claws to conceal its direction of travel. Apart from this, Brown does not offer much detail aside from that the \\"hew-gag\\" is not as \\"ferocious\\" as other woods beasts. Characteristics The modern conception of the hugag is largely derived from 1910's Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods by William T. Cox. In the book, Cox describes the hugag as an animal, constantly meandering, in size corresponding with the moose and adds \\"in form it somewhat resembles that animal.\\" Describing its range as northern Minnesota, western Wisconsin and \\"the Canadian wilds towards Hudson Bay,\\" Cox elaborates: Cox adds that the only means the creature has for rest is to brace itself against a tree, in what condition the animal may be captured should notches be made into the wood. Latter accounts, such as Henry H. Tryon's Fearsome Critters and Richard Dorson's Man and Beast in American Comic Legend, are heavily reliant in the details set down in Cox's work. However, Tryon divulges several characteristics independent from Cox's account including: warts on the snout, bumps on the head and pine needles instead of hairs on the body of the hugag. Similarly, whereas Cox's describes the hugag's diet as consisting of twigs or bark, Tryon contends that the hugag subsists on \\"a steady diet of pine knots makes the pitch ooze constantly from his pores.\\" Folkloric parallels Several commentators, such as folklorist Richard Dorson and author Daniel Cohen, highlight that the hugag's inability to lie down mirrors legendary creatures of classic antiquity. Dorson cites an article by Horace Beck, entitled \\"The Animal that Cannot Lie Down,\\" highlighting that Aristotle opposed the argument that an elephant cannot sit or bends its legs as well that Julius Caesar once reported of an elk that could not lie down. Dorson holds that Cesar's account, in language, closely compares to that of Cox's. Likewise, Daniel Cohen in his 1975 book Monsters, Giants and Little Men from Mars references an account by Pliny the Elder of the Achlis, which likewise possesses equivalent attributes; albeit, Cohen seemingly confuses the hugag with the analogously named Hodag.

They included a number of kings with a serious interest in the arts, who were patrons of a series of major artists: Charles V and Philip II were patrons of Titian, Philip IV appointed Velázquez as court painter, and Goya had a similar role at the court of Charles IV. The royal family were the most important patrons of Spanish art throughout this period, although some important artists including El Greco, Jusepe de Ribera, and Zurbaran were little patronised. Foreign artists were often imported, although even in the 16th century the most successful were often reluctant to go to Spain, partly because they feared they would never be allowed to leave.Trevor- Roper, 45 In addition, at various periods, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, the monarchs bought paintings abroad on a significant scale, especially in Italy, but also the Spanish Netherlands and France. In early periods the scattered Spanish possessions included the important artistic centres of Milan, Naples and the Low Countries. With the loss of the Low Countries as a result of the Peace of Utrecht, the Spanish crown developed tapestry manufacture in Madrid to avoid the need for imports of these luxury items. As a young man, Goya executed a number of tapestry designs for use in the royal palaces. Royal patronage was also used to develop other arts and crafts in Spain in the 18th century, for example the Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja produced luxury glass products. The enormous collections have been significantly reduced by a series of fires, losses in the Napoleonic Wars and to a lesser extent the Spanish Civil War, and diplomatic gifts. The collections have passed to public ownership, and a large number are on display at various locations. Although the collection is rightly most famous for its paintings, with the Prado in Madrid holding the main collection,Prado; collection overview there are large holdings of sculpture, and most forms of the decorative arts. What is probably the world's finest collection of Renaissance Flemish tapestries is mostly displayed at the Palace of La Granja, and the collection of plate armour in the Armoury in the Royal Palace, Madrid is only rivalled by its equivalent in Vienna.Philippe de Montebello, \\"Introduction\\", p. 8, in Resplendence of the Spanish Monarchy: Renaissance Tapestries and Armor from the Patrimonio Nacional, by Antonio Domínguez Ortiz, Concha Herrero Carretero, José-A. Godoy, 1991, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9780870996214, fully online History Equestrian Portrait of Charles V by Titian, 1548 Charles V Few Spanish paintings are recorded in the collection that were owned before the Habsburg reigns. The c. 300 paintings owned by Isabella I of Castile (d. 1504) were dispersed in an auction after her death, with the paintings fetching very low prices compared to the many tapestries or her jewels and even clothes. For example, a painting by Hieronymous Bosch was valued at 170 maravedis, but a tapestry of Lazarus at 150,000. Some pieces were bought by the family, but her husband Ferdinand was mainly interested in the tapestries, paying 524,072 for two sets of four each, and buying the Lazarus piece at a lower price. Isabella's son-in-law Philip the Handsome (Charles V's father) bought the Polytych of Isabella of Castille a set of small religious paintings by Juan de Flandes that have mostly remained in the royal collection (now Royal Palace).Chemades, 41-42 Juan was court painter for Isabella I of Castile from 1496, but all of his paintings in the Prado collection were acquired in the 20th century,Catalogo, 113-114 The collection includes those parts taken to Spain in the 16th century of the collection of the Valois Dukes of Bugundy, whose heir was Charles V. The Early Netherlandish paintings were further reinforced in 1558 on the death of Charles V's sister, Mary of Hungary, shortly after her retirement as governor of the Netherlands. She was a keen collector whose heir was Philip II. Her legacy included the Deposition of Christ by Rogier van der Weyden (Prado), by then over a century old. She also had two dozen Titians.Trevor-Roper, 41, 73-74 Charles V was also the heir of his great-aunt Margaret of Austria (d. 1530), also governor of the Netherlands and a keen collector, though mostly of contemporary Netherlandish paintings. Her collection included the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, which left the collection in the Napoleonic Wars and is now in the National Gallery, London. All of these additions from the Low Countries were probably valued more for their tapestries than their paintings. Charles V spent more on tapestries than paintings (like his contemporary Henry VIII), and commissioned them throughout his life, continuing the family tradition, and reflecting common royal preferences at the time.Chemades, 42-44 The largely German collections of Charles' grandfather Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and the earlier Habsburgs mostly remained in Austria and Germany when in 1556 Charles V abdicated and divided his enormous realms between his brother, who became Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his son Philip, who received Spain, the Netherlands and the Habsburg possessions in Italy. They are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and elsewhere. Charles V was also a keen and discriminating collector, and his relentless travelling made him aware of the diversity of Renaissance art, above all that of Italy.Trevor- Roper, 12-15 He was greatly impressed by a Titian portrait of the Duke of Mantua and his dog (c. 1529, Prado), and arranged for Titian to paint him, in Bologna in 1532, full-length and also with a hound (Prado). This was a repetition of a recent portrait (Vienna) by his brother's court painter Jakob Seisenegger, intended as a demonstration piece. This fully won Charles over, and from then on he never posed for any other portrait painter, as Vasari says, despite the difficulties in meeting Titian to pose.Trevor-Roper, 25-26, 31-32 His Equestrian Portrait of Charles V (Prado) set the standard for the genre, influencing later artists such as Anthony Van Dyck, Rubens, and Goya. But the Milan-based sculptor Leone Leoni, assisted by his son Pompeo, occupied from 1546 an equivalent position in sculpture;Trevor-Roper, 28-30 there are full and half-length bronze portrait sculptures of Charles in the Prado, as well as medals and engraved gems. The Dutch painter Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen was mostly used to record Charles's military victories, especially in designs for large tapestries, and Charles took him on his campaign to Tunis.Trevor-Roper, 28 Philip II Charles's son Philip II of Spain was devoted to his father's memory,Trevor-Roper, 49 and probably more interested in art than his father; certainly he commissioned and bought much more, and by the end of his life the collection included some 1,500 paintings,The Oxford Dictionary of Art, 3rd edn, 2004, p. 323, OUP, , 9780198604761, google books and about 700 tapestries.Chemades, 44 He took over Charles's key artists, Titian and the Leonis, and commissioned the famous and now dispersed series of mythological paintings known as the poesie, which represent some of his finest late works. Of these six or seven paintings, only one at most of the prime versions remained in the collection until transfer to the Prado; five are now in the United Kingdom, and one in the United States.Trevor-Roper, 52 In 1561 Philip established Madrid as the capital of Spain, something his father had planned but never implemented. He also began to construct a massive monument to his father and the other Spanish Habsburgs at El Escorial, whose building and decoration was to be the major artistic project of his reign.

The chamber of Philip IV in the Buen Retiro Royal Palace, Prado In June 1561 Philip II set his court in Madrid, installing it in the Alcázar, which became home to a huge art collection. The monarchy continued to use other palaces. A new palace was begun in 1563 when the corner-stone was laid of El Escorial, a combined monastery and palace in the mountains to the north of the capital. In 1734 the Alcázar was destroyed by fire along with many works of art. The Prado Many of the finest paintings from the former Spanish royal collection are housed in the Museo del Prado, Spain's national art museum. This institution was opened to the public as an art gallery in 1819 in an initiative associated with Queen Maria Isabel. Having been a royal museum (Museo real de pinturas), the Prado was nationalised in 1868 as a consequence of the deposition of Queen Isabel II. To mark the 200th anniversary of the Prado, the Hall of Realms, a surviving 17th- century wing of the Buen Retiro Palace, is being redeveloped as part of the campus of the museum. Originally, the Hall housed large paintings from the royal collection. Some of these, such as equestrian portraits of the family of Philip IV, are now in the Prado.Sánchez, Alfonso E. Pérez (January 1, 2003).\\"Velázquez, Diego\\". Grove Art Online (subscription required) While in theory these paintings could be restored to their original location, this would disrupt the layout of key galleries of the Prado, and other uses are currently envisaged for the Hall of Realms. Royal sites The Royal Collections Museum The heritage agency Patrimonio Nacional looks after a number of royal sites in Spain and the art works in them. A new museum in Madrid, the Royal Collections Museum, has been built in the 21st century on a site near the Palacio Real and the Royal Armoury in order to display material from the royal collections which is in the care of Patrimonio Nacional. The Palacio Real contains numerous artworks including frescoes by Tiepolo and a unique set of Stradivarius instruments known as the Stradivarius Palatinos. Once the new museum is open, the three buildings will be complementary in a way arguably comparable to the triangle of art of the Paseo del Prado. The chronological framework of the new museum is from the Middle Ages to the reign of Juan Carlos I. Patrimonio Nacional has a tradition of organising temporary exhibitions, for example in 2019 it mounted an exhibition about Alfonso XIII's humanitarian intervention in the First World War. It expects to change regularly the exhibits in the new museum. Losses The Waterseller of Seville, Diego Velázquez, 1618–1622 In 1604 much of the secondary royal palace of El Pardo, then just outside Madrid, was destroyed in a fire. Many paintings were rescued, but the group of important royal portraits by Titian and others in the \\"Hall of Kings\\" were mounted on the walls by stucco frames, and could not be taken out in time. Philip III ordered the room to be reconstituted, with Juan Pantoja de la Cruz set to producing new versions of the paintings from the sources available to him.Prado, \\"The Emperor Charles V\\" The Torre de la Parada, then just north of Madrid, was a large hunting lodge started by Charles V and greatly expanded by Philip IV. As such the extreme formality of the main royal palaces was relaxed there. The relatively informal Velázquez royal portraits in hunting clothes, and mock-heroic portraits of court dwarves and jesters, were painted for it, and also a huge series of 60 mythological subjects by Rubens and his workshop, from which 40 of the paintings and over 50 of Rubens' oil sketches survive (Prado).\\"Rubens y la Torre de la Parada\\", by Alejandro Vergara, Prado. See also Svetlana Alpers, The Decoration of the Torre de la Parada, Phaidon Press, 1971, summary The palace was mostly destroyed by fire when taken in 1714 by Austrian troops in the War of Spanish Succession, remaining only as ruins.Aerial photo from El Pardo site But much of the portable art had already been removed to other palaces. The first main home of the collection, the Alcázar of Madrid, was completely destroyed by fire in 1734, with great losses. Some paintings, such as Las Meninas were rescued, in that case by cutting it from its frame and dropping it out of a window. Some paintings had already been installed in the Buen Retiro Palace on the other side of the city centre. The Spanish Habsburgs ruled Portugal from 1581 to 1640 (under Philips II to IV), and Philip II in particular gave the main Lisbon residence the Ribeira Palace much art, including a large ceiling by Titian. This and most of its other art was lost in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake which largely destroyed the palace. Wellington Collection Some 80 paintings from the former Spanish royal collection are in the Wellington Collection in London. These were being taken from Spain by the French when they were captured by the British army at the Battle of Vitoria. They were subsequently gifted to the British general Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington by Fernando VII, and are kept at Apsley House, the London home of the Dukes of Wellington, where they are mainly on public display.

He succeeded his father as owner of the decorative arts firm I.G. Schwartz & Søn in Copenhagen and eventually handed it down to his own son Frans Schwartz. He was president of Industriforeningen from 1746 to 1751. A proponent of improved training of craftsmen in Denmark, he was involved in the establishment of both Industriskolen (The Industry School) and Håndværkerskolen (Craftsmen's School). History Schwartz was born on 26 November 1820 in Copenhagen, the son of turner J. G. Schwartz (1789–1864) and Augusta M. Frels (1791–1885). He attended St. Petri School and Borgerdyd School. After his confirmation, he became an apprentice in his father's workshop at Sværtegade 3. Aged 17, he was sent on a study trip to Paris and London under supervision of the goldsmith Jørgen Balthasar Dalhoff, 20 years his senior, who saw to it that Schwartz diligently visited the cities' museums and manufactories, drawing what he saw. Career On Schwartz' return to Denmark, he became an employee in his father's workshop, chiefly with responsibility for its aesthetic and artistic direction but also as the one with the knowledge of writing that his father had never acquired. He completed his masterpiece and was granted citizenship in 1846, and was the following year made a partner in his father's business which from then on traded as I. G. Schwartz & Søn. Other occupations Already in 1839, aged 18, Schwartz published an article in the magazine Søndagen in which he argued in favour of an improved training of craftsmen. The article instigated a discussion in Industriforeningen which, chiefly at Schwartz's initiative, in 1841, resulted in the establishment of Industriskolen in Snaregade. Schwartz became a member of Industriforeningen's board of representatives (repræsentantskab) in 1842, was a member of a number of its committees, including the Committee for Sunday Meetings for Young Craftsmen 1847–49, and was from 1857 to 1861 president of the association. He worked for affording artists more influence on craftsmen's work. He was an enthusiastic supporter of G. F. Hetsch's efforts to integrate art and craftsmanship. Teaching by his own example, in his own workshop he often collaborated with artists, especially the sculptor C. Peters. Schwartz was in 1859–65 a member of Copenhagen City Council. He was also a member of Kunstflidslotteriet, a lottery established in 1860 to contribute to the rebuilding of Frederiksborg Castle. He was together with Vilhelm Klein responsible for the preparation of Håndværkerskolen in 1868. He was the same year also elected as a member of Arbejdernes Byggeforening. Personal life and legacy Schwartz married Thora Lovise Kühl (16 February 1816 – 8 March 1875), a daughter of auditor and Livjæger captain Casper Joachim Kyhl (1790–1853) and Louise Dorothea Frels (1793–1880), on 23 February 1847. Schwartz was created a Knight in the Order of the Dannebrog in 1752. He died on 31 December 1874 and is buried in Assistens Cemetery. I. F. Schwartz & Søn was continued by his son Frans Schwartz. The street J.A. Schwartz Gade in Kartoffelrækkerne is named after him.

Dhruv's mother Nutan and his aunt Sheetal oppose their relationship due to Sonam's modern ways while her father Pratap finds Dhruv's family very backward in their thinking.

Nutan, Sheetal, Pratap and Tanu become allies to stop their wedding. Their plan is to get Dhruv to marry his childhood friend Shweta/Milky, who has always had a crush on Dhruv. Milky persuaded Sonam to go to her mother to do bridal makeup while she impersonates Sonam as the bride. Sonam does so and Milky's mother manages to drug her to sleep. Sonam wakes up too late and witnesses Dhruv getting married to Milky. Sonam tries to explain why she wasn't at the wedding, but Milky and Nutan place all the blame on Sonam. This went on to a point when Nutan burns herself intentionally. Dhruv, in a fit of rage, throws Sonam and her family out of the house. Dhruv does not accept Milky as his wife, despite his mother's pleas. Sonam realizes the truth of what happened on the wedding day and decides to expose Milky to Dhruv as a cheat.

Foley is an American lawyer, law professor, election law scholar, and former Ohio Solicitor General. He is the theorist of the blue shift, a phenomenon in US politics in which in-person votes overstate overall percentage of votes for the Republican Party (whose color is red), while provisional votes, which are counted after election day, tend to overstate overall percentage of votes for the Democratic Party (whose color is blue). When the provisional votes are counted after the election, there is often a shift in totals toward the Democrat, or blue, candidate.  Education and career  Foley graduated from Yale in 1983 with a degree in History and from Columbia University School of Law in 1986. He clerked in 1986–1987 for Patricia M. Wald and 1988–1989 for Harry Blackmun. Foley is an associate professor of law at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law, where he has taught since 1991. He served as Ohio's Solicitor General from 1999 to 2000.  Blue shift  Foley coined the term \\"blue shift\\" after the 2012 midterm election. An election law scholar, he had been studying closely contested state results to try to predict which might be challenged legally. He wondered whether votes counted after election day tended to affect the final count. He found that election-day vote counts tend to favor Republicans, while when provisionally cast or mail-in votes are counted, the provisional votes tended to favor Democrats; this results in a \\"blue shift\\" in final vote counts and the potential for results to change after election day. Foley did not find that mail-in or absentee votes favored either party. Studying results of presidential elections from 1960 through 2012, Foley found that a \\"clear and persistent\\" blue shift had occurred in each election since 2000. Foley theorizes that election reforms in 2000, which made provisional voting easier, favored some demographics that tend to lean Democrat such as lower-income voters, college students, and urban voters, who are likely to have moved since the last election and may not have updated their voter registration. He found that the size of the shift varied by state, but that it was consistent enough to potentially change the outcome of a presidential election. In 2013 he published a paper about the phenomenon, A Big Blue Shift: Measuring an Asymmetrically Increasing Margin of Litigation. 2020 presidential election According to the New York Times: In 2019 Foley published a paper, Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election: An Exercise in Election Risk Assessment and Management, in which he posited a scenario in which on election night, Pennsylvania is the crucial state and too close to call, though Donald Trump has a slim lead. As provisional ballots are counted, Trump's lead starts to evaporate and he becomes more and more agitated, tweeting demands that only the election night counts are valid and calling for his supporters to \\"STOP THIS THEFT RIGHT NOW!!!\\" \\"DON'T LET THEM STEAL THIS ELECTION FROM YOU!!!\\", calling it a plausible scenario. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer he believes \\"raising awareness of the blue shift can help inoculate people against unfounded claims.\\" In March 2020 Foley and MIT political scientist Charles Stewart updated a paper, Explaining the Blue Shift in Election Canvassing, which found that \\"the bluer the state, the greater the shift\\", which had first been published in 2015. Foley in August 2020 said expected increases in numbers of votes cast by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic could affect the size and direction of the shift in the November 2020 US presidential election. He told the New York Times \\"We're setting ourselves up for an election where neither side can concede defeat. That suggests that the desire to dispute the outcome is going to be higher than ever.\\"  National Task Force on Election Crises  Foley participated in a 2019 bipartisan task force, the National Task Force on Election Crises, to envision, assess, and develop plans for dealing with an election crisis. Among the scenarios considered but not included in the 200-page report was a pandemic that kept people from voting in-person. The task force published pandemic-related recommendations after the coronavirus pandemic struck.

Overview The power line was developed as part of plans to improve grid power delivery and reliability to the districts in the Kigezi sub-region and to deliver high voltage electricity to Kabale, the largest city in Kigezi. The other consideration is to evacuate power generated by Kikagati Hydroelectric Power Station (16 megawatts) and Nshungyezi Hydroelectric Power Station (39 megawatts) and transmit it to Kabale for industrial, commercial and domestic use. A loan obtained from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), was used in funding the construction of this power line, including a 132/33kV substations at Mirama Hills, and Kabale. In addition, funded by that same loan, is the construction of medium voltage (33kV and 11kV) distribution lines and low voltage (415V and 214V) lines. Also, a total of 377 transformers (25kVA, 50kVA, 100kVA & 200kVA) will be installed, together with 14,185 last-mile customer connections. Construction and funding Work on this power transmission line began in 2014. In 2015, the Islamic Development Bank agreed to lend the government of Uganda US$83,750,000 to build this power line and Opuyo–Moroto High Voltage Power Line. As of June 2019, procurement of a contractor for the Mirama–Kabale Transmission Line was ongoing.

She organized consumer support for the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, particularly targeting congressional wives and women's groups. Early life Ruth deforest Lamb was born in 1896 in Hallstead, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Vassar College in 1918. She worked as an advertising copywriter from 1918-1926, one of the first women in the emerging field of advertising. For several years, she worked as an advertising consultant on food, drug, and cosmetic products. A century of progress In 1933, Lamb joined the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming its first Chief Educational Officer. For the \\"Century of progress\\" Chicago World's Fair of 1933, Lamb worked with the FDA's Chief Inspector, George Larrick, to create an exhibit of 100 products which it considered \\"dangerous, deceptive, or worthless\\" but which the FDA had no legal authority to ban. These included products like Lash Lure, a dye for eyelashes, which had led to cases of blindness and death. In the Government building at the Fair, the FDA displayed seventeen boards showing \\"large, vivid pictures coupled with spare, terse prose\\". Photographs of the panels and the exhibit are included in the Ruth Lamb Atkinson Papers at Vassar College. Between June and November, millions visited. In October 1933, Paramount produced a 2 minute newsreel clip referencing the exhibit and discussing proposals for revised legislation, presented by Rexford Tugwell. After the World's Fair was closed on November 12, 1933, the exhibit was returned to Washington, D.C. There it was visited by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, attracting considerable media attention. The exhibit was dubbed a \\"chamber of horrors\\" by reporters. American chamber of horrors Ruth Lamb used the nickname in the title of her book, American chamber of horrors: the truth about food and drugs (1936). Lamb's book was written in part to counter the criticisms of 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics (1933) by Arthur Kallet and Frederick J. Schlink. Their book harshly criticized the FDA for not countering the marketing of dangerous and misleading foods, drugs and cosmetics. In American chamber of horrors, Lamb discussed many of the same products. She incorporated information from the FDA's 1933 exhibit, and from the FDA's archives, indicating that dangerous products were known and studied by the FDA. Both FDA officials and Lamb herself stated that she wrote the book as a private citizen, and not as an official representative of the FDA. Nonetheless, her position as an FDA educational officer gave her access to important government sources. She made effective use of letters from private citizens requesting help and legislation. In addition, Lamb discussed the regulation of such products in the context of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, or \\"Wiley Act\\". Lamb \\"systematically explored the legal limitations\\" of the Wiley Act, explaining in detail areas where it was outdated, obsolete, or could not be applied, including the use of radio for advertising and the regulation of cosmetics and medical devices. By doing so, she suggested a pattern for the development of new legislation and made a powerful case for its need. Lamb's book American chamber of horrors, like 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, became both popular and influential. Lamb played a key role in communicating the limitations of existing legislation and the need for new legislation, to the public, to Congressmen, and to their wives. Lamb focused her efforts on mobilizing women's groups around the need for new legislation. Washington women like Eleanor Roosevelt and other Congressional wives in Washington, D.C. had both an interest in the issue and the potential to influence discussions, pressuring lawmakers to take their concerns seriously. This work resulted in the passage of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Other works In 1937, news media reported that Lamb had written a script which was under option to be made into a movie. Provisionally titled \\"Permit to Kill\\", B. P. Schulberg was suggested to be the producer and Edward Arnold one of the actors. It does not appear that the movie was made. Lamb also wrote a manuscript for The Devil's Candle: An Informal History of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Its Operation in Our Social Economy (1937). It was advertised in \\"Preview of Books for Public Health Workers\\" in the American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health for 1938, but may not have been published. A manuscript is included in her papers at Vassar College. Her papers also include a manuscript for \\"Magic Oyster\\" (1928), an unpublished novel. Later life In 1942 Ruth deForest Lamb married Henry R. Atkinson and left the FDA. She and her husband traveled in India for some years following World War II. She eventually returned to Washington, D. C., where she continued to work as a lobbyist for consumer groups such as the National Congress of Parents and Teachers (1942-45). Between 1943 and 1946 she served as a director of Food for Freedom, Ind. Ruth deForest Lamb died on June 17, 1978.

It was painted a few months before the cardinal's death and is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 987–2–1. The painting originally consisted of at least two portraits of Richelieu: right profile and frontal. The frontal portrait was cut off at some point and lost; X-ray examinations of the painting have revealed that it has once existed and that the remaining trace has been concealed by an added border. Conversely, it is not established if a left profile portrait on the same canvas had once existed as well. The Strasbourg version (as a double or maybe triple portrait) then served as the basis for the Triple Portrait of Cardinal de Richelieu, which was mostly painted by Champaigne's workshop, and is considered artistically inferior. The Triple Portrait was in turn used as a model for a bust.

Life He was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Hungary, and lost his father at the age of three. His mother took over his early education, and ensured his upbringing in a religious-minded Jewish manner; Stern learned to read Hebrew before he could read the Latin alphabet. He continued his education at a Benedictine school and at a gymnasium in Budapest, where he acquired knowledge of Greek and Latin. At the same time, Stern began learning Arabic on his own. With the rise of Nazi Germany, in 1939 his mother sent Stern to safety in Mandatory Palestine. She remained behind, and would be killed during the Holocaust. In Palestine he enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he studied under a series of prominent teachers, including the Arabist David H. Baneth, the Semiticist Hans J. Polotsky, the philosopher Leon Roth, the historian of Islamic philosophy Julius Guttmann, and the Romanist Hiram Pflaum-Peri. At the Hebrew University he also met and befriended Shelomo Dov Goitein, who introduced him to medieval Islamic history. During World War II he interrupted his studies and served with the British censor office at Baghdad and Port Sudan. He finished his university studies in 1947. During his war service Stern met the Orientalist Paul Kraus, who introduced him to Isma'ili studies, a major area of interest for Stern during his later career. After completing his degree, he went to Oxford University for post-graduate studies under H. A. R. Gibb at St. Catherine's College. He completed his PhD on Andalusi strophic poetry (The Old Andalusian Muwashshah, published posthumously as Hispano-Arabic Strophic Poetry) in 1950. He would remain based at Oxford University for the remainder of his life: he accepted invitations to lecture at other institutions, but refused any permanent position, despite offers from the likes of Harvard University. At Oxford he lived in the same house as his close friends, Professor Richard Walzer and his wife Sofie. In 1951–1956, Stern served as assistant editor for the second edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam. In 1956–57 he was Assistant Keeper of Oriental Coins at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, followed by being elected to a Research Fellowship at All Souls College. From 1964 and until his death he was additionally Lecturer In the History of the Islamic Civilization. Stern died of a severe asthma attack in October 1969. Work Stern was a prolific scholar who wrote on a variety of topics and issues. By the time of his death, he had 265 publications, including a few books. Most of his writings on medieval Islamic history and civilization were posthumously collected and reprinted in three Variorum Collected Studies volumes (Medieval Arabic and Hebrew Thought in 1983, History and Culture in the Medieval Muslim World in 1984 and Coins and Documents from the Medieval Middle East in 1986).

On July 26, 1940, he was appointed head of the Communications Department of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Having familiarized himself with the state of affairs in the Directorate, he came to the conclusion that there was a huge shortage of communications equipment in the troops. From October 1940 to June 1941, he repeatedly addressed reports on the need to urgently rectify matters to People's Commissar of Defense Semyon Timoshenko, Chiefs of the General Staff Kirill Meretskov and Georgy Zhukov, Chairman of the Defense Committee under the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union Kliment Voroshilov, but the measures he proposed did not have been implemented. As a result, from the first days of the Great Patriotic War, the lack of proper communication at all levels of troops became one of the important reasons for losses in command and control of troops and military defeats. Great Patriotic War, arrest, repression Dismissed from office on July 22, 1941.A number of publications indicate the date of July 23 According to the memoirs of the future Marshal of the Signal Corps Ivan Peresypkin, this happened during the report of Nikolai Gapich to Joseph Stalin on the state of communications in the troops.Ivan Peresypkin. ...And in Battle It is Even More Important – Moscow: Soviet Russia, 1970 – Pages 74–75 A few days later, he was appointed chief of communications of the Front of the Reserve Armies, arrived at the front, but did not manage to take office.

Arrested on August 6, 1941.Marina Eliseeva. Forgotten General // \\"A Red Star\\" – 2011, May 5 He was under investigation for a long time. At first, he was accused of criminal leadership in the work of his administration, that he did not supply the army with the required amount of communication means, in the war with Germany he did not meet the needs of the front and was unable to establish uninterrupted communication with the fronts. Then added the accusation of participation in a \\"military–fascist conspiracy\\". After using physical pressure, he slandered himself and admitted that since 1935 he was a member of an anti-Soviet organization in the Belarusian Military District and headed by Ieronim Uborevich. Even later, accusations were added of working for Japanese intelligence during the Civil War. Then Nikolay Gapich retracted all confessions. In view of the complete absurdity, the charges of conspiracy and espionage were dropped from him.Nikolay Cherushev. A Blow to Your Friends.

Name Nahalat Binyamin is translated as \\"the estate of Benjamin\\". Nahala (with different ways of transliterating/spelling it), is a Hebrew word for either heritage or estate. The second part of the name, Binyamin (the original Hebrew form of the English name Benjamin) has two possible origins: officially it refers to the Hebrew name of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political Zionism. However, local lore has it that the founders of Nahalat Binyamin asked for money from both the Jewish National Fund (JNF) organisation, closely linked to Herzl's activity, and from Baron Edmond de Rothschild, whose Hebrew name was also Benjamin, a man famous for being a major benefactor of Jewish settlement in Ottoman Palestine. Location Nahalat Binyamin Street runs north to south. It begins in the north at Magen David Square, where it intersects with four other streets: Allenby, King George and its continuation HaCarmel, and Menahem Sheinkin. As of 2020, it has a car-free section down to Gruzenberg Street, and the municipality is planning to add to this the section between Kalischer Street and Rothschild Boulevard.New Pedestrian Streets, Municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo, 20 May 2020. Accessed 15 August 2020. Continuing southwards, Nahalat Binyamin crosses Jaffa and Florentin Streets, and ends ar Shalma Road. The street's pedestrian section runs very close to the Carmel food market and Allenby Street, which is one of Tel Aviv's major arteries, and is close to the Kerem HaTeimanim quarter (lit. \\"Vineyard of the Yemenites\\"), an old, poorer neighborhood boasting a great number of good eateries, all of which helped Nahalat Binyamin becoming fully commercial, and since 1987 adds to its attractiveness as an arts-and-crafts fair. History Ahuzat Bayit, the home-building association of wealthy Jewish families which started off the city of Tel Aviv, started building in 1909. The purpose was escaping the crowded and unsanitary Old City of Jaffa. At about the same time, the Nahalat Binyamin Association, consisting mainly of tradesmen and clerks, craftsmen, shopkeepers, booksellers, a baker and a laundress, had trouble financing their own, similar project. The Jewish National Fund, which had helped out Ahuzat Bayit, was not forthcoming, as was the bank they approached. In 1911, a journalist and Zionist activist known as Rabbi Binyamin (actual name: Yehoshua Redler Feldman), a pioneer of the Second Aliyah (see #External links), wrote an angry article accusing the two institutions of favouring the well-off. Soon after its publication, the association acquired a long strip of land among the sand dunes running parallel to the coast. The 20 dunams (five acres) the association had purchased were divided into 35 plots. They started building right away, at first modest Arab-style homes with two rooms and a kitchen. The first houses of both Nahalat Binyamin and Achuzat Bayit were one- storey buildings with residential purpose, with Jaffa still being the main hub for work and business. Most houses were built of local kurkar, by Arab workmen from Jaffa, without an architect's plan and just following their experience. That same year, 1911, the association also signed an agreement with the renamed Ahuzat Bayit, by then already called Tel Aviv, partly joining it and agreeing to connect its streets to Tel Aviv's and to participate in the infrastructure costs, in exchange for being connected to Tel Aviv's water supply system and other services. The next year, with 23 houses already standing, Nahalat Binyamin became an integral part of Tel Aviv. The neighborhood consisted of Nahalat Binyamin Street itself, which ran parallel to Herzl Street, Tel Aviv's main axis, as well as Kalisher Street. In its early years, Nahalat Binyamin Street was the longest road in Tel Aviv. Along with its residential role, right from the beginning it housed small shops, with many of its first inhabitants being metal craftsmen, as well as booksellers and various shopkeepers. In the 1920s, a decade of repeated anti- Jewish Arab riots in Jaffa, many Jews left that city and moved to a constantly growing Tel Aviv. At this time Nahalat Binyamin Street became Tel Aviv's main commercial thoroughfare. The houses underwent a process of transformation, additional storeys being added and the shops occupying the bottom floor. The residential buildings of the neighbourhood had been initially planned to be surrounded by gardens, and were built on raised platforms or podiums lining the pavements. Also in the 1920s, the dirt road called Nahalat Binyamin was paved, the workers being mostly women. The location and length of Nahalat Binyamin made it into a preferred spot for city ceremonies and events, eventually becoming fully commercial. Before being transformed into a pedestrian mall in 1987, Nahalat Binyamin was one of Tel Aviv's noisiest streets, with some 60,000 vehicles passing through daily. The city decided to close off Nahalat Binyamin and two adjacent streets to vehicles, at the same time establishing the arts-and-crafts fair, the first of its kind in Israel. What began with several dozen stands, by 2011 had reached over 200. Architecture Nahalat Binyamin Street has a variety of simple old houses, eclectic buildings dominant until the 1920s with a mix of Eastern and Western elements, flashes of Art Deco elements, and modernistic International Style houses from the 1930s, the latter style locally better known as Bauhaus. Notable buildings *Polishuk House (Beit Polishuk), at the corner with Allenby Street, 1934, architects Shlomo Liaskovsky and Jacob (Yaakov) Orenstein, which after being restored by Israeli architect Nitza Szmuk and with a new interior design by Karim Rashid, now houses the Poli House Hotel. *Palm Tree House (Beit HaDekel) at 8, Nahalat Binyamin. Built in 1922 after plans by architect Yehoshua Zvi Tabachnik (Tavori), it is among the most extravagant houses on the street, with Oriental and specifically Jewish Art Nouveau design elements, such as the name-giving palm tree on the facade, altar horns, menorahs and two Stars of David. *Leitz-Soroka House, 1921, architect Y. Z. Tabachnik, at 10, Nahalat Binyamin. First built by as a one- storey house, it was raised by one floor in 1925 and covered by a tiled roof. Despite having two different owners and spreading across two lots, the house was built and functioned as a single building with a shared stairwell. The impressive Eclectic-Style façade was damaged by changes made from 1926 onwards, when the ground floor was adapted for commercial purposes, as it happened along the entire street. Large show-windows were opened into the main façade, badly affecting their beautiful original design. As of 2020, the building is being restored and expanded, as part of the gentrification process in the area. *Shmuel Levy House, 1926. Eclectic style, known for its ceramic tiles with biblical themes produced by a Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts graduate. *Urn House, 1927, designed by architect Zeev Rechter, at 16, Nachlat Binyamin/Rambam Square. The name is derived from the urns or amphorae decorating its corners. *Pillars House (Beit HaAmudim; also Zalman Noah House), 1925 or 1927, designed in the Eclectic Style by architect Yehuda Magidovitch, from 16, Rambam Street to HaTavor (Tabor) Street. Named for its Italian Renaissance-influenced pillars and arches. A large building covering an area of ca. two dunams. *Spector Hotel, 1914, at 18, Nahalat Binyamin, established by hotelier Elkana Spector. It was used as an infirmary for Jewish victims of the 1921 Jaffa riots, afterwards becoming Tel Aviv's main Hadassah Hospital building, until a new one was built on Balfour Street.Sign: Tel Aviv - Rambam Square. At streetsigns.co.il. Accessed 15 August 2020. Rami Meiri, a Tel Aviv graffiti artist, has painted the facade at the corner between Binyamin and Mohilever Street. *Nordau Hotel, 1927, Eclectic Style, by Yehuda Magidovitch, on the corner Nahalat Binyamin–Gruzenberg Street. As of 2015, Tel Aviv's oldest hotel in continuous use. *46-48, Nahalat Binyamin - 17, Ahad Ha'am Street. The new Isrotel boutique hotel connects two buildings, both marked for preservation, into one. The building at 46, Nahalat Binyamin Street uniquely shows the historical development typical for the neighborhood and the city as a whole. Built in 1913 after the sketches of the owner as a one-storey residence, it was made of kurkar stones with a tiled roof. The owner was Yaakov Matmon, the brother of Yehuda Leib Matmon-Cohen, one of the founders of Ahuzat Bayit. Later, the ground floor was transformed into a shop, which required it to be lowered, as it had been built up on a podium alongside the pavement. The facade was adapted accordingly, and the tiled gable roof was replaced by a flat roof. The second building, at 48, Nahalat Binyamin Street, was built in 1911 as the home of Rabbi Binyamin (Yehoshua Redler Feldman), mentioned in the #History paragraph. Other attractions Tuesdays and Fridays, the Nahalat Binyamin Arts & Crafts Fair, the country's largest, attracts with the work of more than 200 artists selected by a public committee. Nahalat Binyamin and Florentin are the Tel Aviv neighborhoods with the most vivid graffiti art scene, with rich, unusual and thought-provoking murals. The neighborhood offers easy access to the Carmel food market, to the Kerem HaTeimanim neighbourhood with its simple grilled-meat eateries and established restaurants, and on to Neve Tzedek, a tourist magnet on the way to Jaffa.

The local Jewish community grew rapidly, and from the beginning of the 19th century made up more than half of the entire population of Bialystok: until the First World War, Jews made up 75% -66% of the city's population, but between the two world wars the proportion of Jews dropped to 50%-60% of the residents. The great development of the city and the Jewish community in it, is related to the development of the textile industry in Bialystok in the 19th century. In 1850, the first Jewish factory was established, and as early as 1867, about half of the 89 weaving factories in Bialystok were Jewish-owned. The city developed a system of Hebrew, elementary and high schools, many youth movements, diverse from Jewish society, and also published a press in Yiddish. With the German occupation in World War II, a Nazi ghetto was established for the Jews of Bialystok. During the last stages of the ghetto's existence, between 16 and 20 August 1943, a major revolt took place in the Białystok ghetto, led by members of the youth movements. Few fled to the forests and continued to fight as partisans, and the rest of the Jews of Bialystok, about 50,000, were mostly sent to Auschwitz extermination camp. History=Early years Jewish settlement in Podlaskie Voivodeship dates back to the 15th century, when small groups of the Mosaic faith appeared in Bielsk Podlaski. In 1522, the Trakai voivode, Olbracht Gasztołd, brought nine Jewish families to Tykocin. The village, founded in the first half of the 15th century, which later became the city of Białystok, fell into the hands of the Branicki family in 1685. Jews lived there as early as 1658, which is confirmed by the information in the chronicle of the board of the Jewish religious community in Tykocin. It is known that in 1661 the poll tax was paid by 75 Jews from Białystok. In 1663, the chronicle noted that 75 Jewish men and women of over 14 years lived in Bialystok. The Białystok Jews were initially subordinate to the community in Tykocin. In 1691, a special district was separated for them in parts of the land obtained in 1691 from the Catholic Church. On July 11, 1692, the legal situation of Jews in Bialystok was settled - they were allowed then to own a temple and cemetery.Romaniuk Z. The Jewish of Bialystok until 1915, Bialystok, 2001, p. 147-148. In the eighties and nineties of the seventeenth century a large group of Jewish settlers came from Brest-Litovsk. As a result, there were economic and religious tensions, and their accumulation was accusing Jews of ritual murder. According to Christian sources, six-year-old Gabriel, born on March 22, 1684, was abducted by the Jewish leaseholder from Zwierek - Szutka - to Białystok, where he was also killed. Regardless of the tensions, the Jewish population very quickly began to play an increasingly important role in the development of the city. heir economic position and demographic potential is evidenced by the construction in 1718 of a house of prayer (Beth midrash) in the city. A document issued by the Białystok jewish community (kehillah) dates back to 1711, in which he received PLN 1,000 from Teresa Wydrzycka, in exchange for which he was to pay 10% of the sum transferred annually, and after the death of the borrower, interest was to be reduced by 25%. At the beginning of the 18th century the Jews were separated from the Białystok municipal authorities and were subject directly to the superior castle authority. Within the kahal, the Białystok Jews had an extensive official structure, which was reformed by Izabela Branicka in 1777. The Jewish community was to choose for the whole year and for each month separately the \\"senior year\\" and \\"senior month\\" who managed the community. On the other hand, finance was entrusted to the \\"driller\\" who chose taxes, paid installments on the sums of money located in the kahal. As usual, all activities should take place in the bet midrash, under the general supervision of the court authority. In order to protect against embezzlement, the kahal cash register had three locks, one key for it was a drill, senior year and month senior. Jews had separate craft features, in 1777 it was a tailor, bakery, Cyrillic and furrier guild. The rabbi, according to the owners' will, was obliged to consent to the wedding. The court authorities ordered them to check the candidates in terms of their property. The future husband had to run or have money to set up his own business (e.g. trading by setting up a stall), or he should be professionally prepared for paid work (acquiring skills in a craft). The Jewish community administration kept three books - the first financial concerned the kehilla's revenues and expenses; in the second, all kehilla officials were enrolled; the third court contained protests, demonstrations and documentation of civil and criminal proceedings. In internal disputes between Jews, a kahal court (presided over by a senior year and senior month) or a clergy court (headed by a rabbi) was used, during which Talmudic law was used. If the subject of the claim exceeded 500 Zloty, she was entitled to \\"Apellacya from the clergyman, Jewish and kehilla court of Tuteyes, according to the dawney of the act, she would always be free to the Tykockiey synagogue.\\" This remnant of the tykocin kahal's sovereignty is interesting because formally the Białystok kahal gained independence as early as 1745, and in 1771 the commune gained authority over the Jewish People in 59 centers, including Choroszcz and Gródek.The History of Branicki Palace Until 1809. The Influence of \\"Versailles of Podlasie\\" on the Development of Bialystok. Karol Lopatecki, 2018 By the 19th century the Jewish population lived mainly in the city center, by the Kościuszko market square, and also in the quarter between Lipowa Street and the Biała River, along Mikołajewska (currently Sienkiewicza street) and Suraska. The oldest part of the Jewish district, called Szulhof, inhabited mainly by Orthodox people, was concentrated around the main synagogue and was located in the southern part of Suraska street. The second center of religious life was located near Kupiecka Street (currently Malmeda Street), Żydowska Street (now Białówny street) and Giełdowa street (now Spółdzielcza street), and its center was a reformed synagogue called Chorsul (stood in the place of today's 6 Białówny Street). In the 19th century another two, poorer neighborhoods of the city were developing Chanajki and Piaski (area of the Młynowa, Brukowa, Grunwaldzka, Kijowska, Krakowska, Marmurowa, Stoleczna, Sukienna, Mławska, Odeska, Cieszyńska, Angielska, Sosnowa, Czarna streets as well as Rynek Sienny). Second Polish Republic The Torah education system in Białystok during the 1930s was unique in that the Cheder and the Mesivta Yeshiva were both in the same city and under the same educational system. Most other cities only had a cheder. Second World War In 1939 the area of Bialystok and the region came under the rule of the Soviet Union in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The city and the region were incorporated into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. =German occupation and the Holocaust= On June 22, 1941 with the onset of Nazi Germany's offensive, there was great panic in Bialystok, which was then part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Red Army began to flee and shops were looted, and prisoners, including Jews, escaped from prisons. David Klementinowski, a Jewish who lived in the city wrote: \\"Everyone who can, escapes with the Russians. The streets are full of tragic sights. Families who have lived together for decades must separate. The Soviet army's warehouses are looted by people for food and the Poles attack the Jews. We are afraid to leave the house because no one In an environment that will maintain law and order\\".אגרת 9 - בן גוריון מנע הצלת יהודים משטחי הכיבוש הנאצי The German forces occupied the city and established the Białystok Ghetto, a Nazi ghetto set up by the German SS between July 26 and early August 1941 in the newly formed District of Bialystok within occupied Poland. About 50,000 Jews from the vicinity of Białystok and the surrounding region were confined into a small area of the city, which was turned into the district's capital. The ghetto was split in two by the Biała River running through it (see map). Most inmates were put to work in the slave-labor enterprises for the German war effort, primarily in large textile, shoe and chemical companies operating inside and outside its boundaries. The ghetto was liquidated in November 1943.Szymon Datner, The Fight and the Destruction of Ghetto Białystok. December 1945. Kiryat Białystok, Yehud. Its inhabitants were transported in Holocaust trains to the Majdanek concentration camp and Treblinka extermination camps. Only a few hundred survived the war, either by hiding in the Polish sector of the city, escape following the Bialystok Ghetto Uprising, or by surviving the camps. Polish People's Republic On the wave of forced emigration lasting until the early 1970s, up to a hundred people of Jewish origin left Białystok. After March 1968, the end of the Jewish world was discussed in relation to the whole of Poland, but in that city it was clearly visible. From the data that she managed to collect in the archives of the Institute of National Remembrance in the following years, it appears that by the end of 1968 ten permits to travel to Israel were issued in Bialystok. The following year, 58 people received such consent, and in 1970 only 25. In this group there were 3 members of the Polish United Workers' Party and 32 non-partisans, 17 representatives of the intelligentsia and 18 workers, 5 people with higher education, 11 with secondary education and 19 with primary education. It is difficult to get precise data on the emigration of Jews from Bialystok, because after the March events official documents did not mention Jewish nationality, there were almost no Jewish institutions here that would keep such records, and many people \\"resigned\\" from their Jewishness, e.g. after the war did not return to its identity, displacing it or deliberately making such decisions.Żydzi w Białymstoku po II wojnie światowej jako przykład społeczności zanikającej The first politically motivated request for recognition of Jewish nationality and permission to travel to Israel \\"to fight the Arabs\\" was sent to the relevant authorities on June 8, 1967 from a student of the Witold Szer High School of Engineering. A significant part of the Białystok post-migration emigration did not reach Israel. They chose Sweden, Denmark or France, as well as Australia and the USA. At the beginning of the 1970s, around 60 people of Jewish descent counted in the Białystok Voivodeship, the vast majority of them in old age. Out of over 40,000 Bialystok Jews living in Bialystok before the Second World War, about 6,000 survived it. About a thousand returned to Białystok after the war (including repatriates from the East, for whom Białystok was a stop on their journey), but a significant part left immediately because there was nothing left of their pre-war world. As part of the end of the Jewish world in Bialystok, in 1970 the branch of the Social and Cultural Association of Jews in Poland was liquidated, and its chairman - Jankiel Ostryński left for Denmark. At the beginning of 1971, among others the \\"ghetto\\" cemetery at Żabia Street eventually ceased to exist. The remains of around 3,500 Jews were exhumed in order to build apartment blocks in Osiedle Sienkiewicza. Anti- Semitic action on the wave of March '68 was weak in the city, because after the war, there were very few Jews in Bialystok, especially in positions - prof. Sadowska recalls archival materials about Bialystok from the late 1960s. For the most part, Białystok was inhabited by immigrant, mainly rural, people who showed less political activity and conservative attitude, and were reluctant to engage in risky ventures. A much later event, the invasion of Czechoslovakia was much more experienced in the city, because the specter of war appealed to the inhabitants 'imagination more clearly than unclear personal competitions. There was no clear play inside the PZPR because the local party organization was weak and suffered from a shortage of staff rather than an excess of people with ambitions. The PZPR Białystok Voivodeship Committee was the executor of the Central Committee's decision and never showed much activity.Ostateczny koniec świata Żydów w Białymstoku. Marzec '68 The Bialystok Voivodeship Committee of the PZPR took action on March 2 in connection with student protests in Warsaw. Meetings with party activists, teachers, militiamen, meetings of secretaries of basic party organizations, school and plant directors, trade unions, and especially the basic party organization at universities, began to be organized \\"to learn facts and interpret them.\\" The temperature of events in the capital has risen since the March 8 rally, but even then there was no great tension in Bialystok, and KW assessed the political situation in the province as \\"basically favorable\\". Greater propaganda activity began on March 13. On this day, Gazeta Białostocka wrote for the first time about the incidents in Warsaw, and the authorities began organizing mass meetings and protest rallies at workplaces and universities, usually ending with the adoption of a resolution.Ostateczny koniec świata Żydów w Białymstoku. Marzec '68 Around 300 such resolutions were adopted in the province, and 255 collective and many individual solidarity letters were sent to Władysław Gomułka. The environment of the Białystok Jews also responded to current events in its resolution. Perhaps some direct pressure was put on it, but most likely these people on their own initiative issued a declaration that was to protect them against possible attacks and accusations. In a resolution adopted on March 18 at an extended meeting, the board of the Białystok branch of the Social and Cultural Association of Jews in Poland, among others he stated firmly: \\"The guarantee of Jewish existence in Poland is only socialism.\\" This resolution was probably also issued out of fear. It was feared that the war would come back, the war demons of the Holocaust returned. Probably painful for them in the atmosphere of the witch- hunt was the release of such a statement, but perhaps they thought that in this way they would protect themselves and other Jews. They will not allow the anti-Jewish action to escalate. In Bialystok, the place where the March accidents and their consequences became most felt was the Medical Academy. The victim of the anti-Semitic purge was professor Jakub Chlebowski, then the head of the 2nd Internal Medicine Clinic of the Medical Academy (in 1959-1962 the rector of this university). He was well known and appreciated in the city. After 1968 crisis the hunt for Jews that began to talk about their roots. This is an attitude that often took place during World War II among seemingly polonized Jews - when they felt a sense of oppression in which their nation found themselves - they felt solidarity with other Jews. Jakub Chlebowski came from the Jewish Frydman family, studied and worked in Vilnius in the interwar period. He spent the war deep in the USSR, where he worked as a doctor and was chairman of the Union of Polish Patriots in Krasnoyarsk. He returned to Poland in April 1945 and then probably changed his name to Chlebowski. He has been working in Bialystok since 1951. In March 1968, pro-Israel and pro-American statements were pointed out to him. Justifying the harmful effect on student youth, the rector Ludwik Komczyński made the request to remove him from the position of head of the clinic. He eventually left for Israel, where he soon died of an accident; it is possible that this was a suicide. In 1968, Professor Janusz Lesiński, head of the Dermatology Clinic, also lost his job at the AMB on the wave of anti-Jewish purges. He was one of the organizers of dermatological treatment in the region, he conducted research on venereal diseases. In March 1969, the SB detained in Bialystok Marek Trokenheim, a former student of the University of Warsaw, who \\"while preparing for his trip to Israel, prepared, with the intention of deporting in hostile cells, materials on last year's events in March and the problems of the Jewish national minority in the PRL.\\" He eventually left to Denemark, was editor of Stockholm's \\"Polish News\\" and the vice president of the Congress of Poles in Sweden. Among those who directly affected the then anti-Jewish purges was Sonia Rogowska, former head of the department of the Provincial Public Security Office. In 1968 she was removed from the PZPR. She was accused of supporting Israel's aggression and \\"speaking hostile to our Government and the Government of the USSR,\\" and for talking about discrimination against Jews in Poland, defending those removed from the party, and allowing her daughter to wear a star badge David. She eventually emigrated to Israel in 1981. In 1983, the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising was celebrated again The role of the organizer was played by the vice-president of the city, Wacław Ostaszewski, called as \\"a promoter of continuing Jewish traditions in Białystok\\". Representatives of the city's local authorities came to the ceremony at Plac Bohaterów Getta, scouts raised a guard of honor at the memorial plaque in the place of the ghetto cemetery. Representatives of TSKŻ came with the chairman of the Jewish Committee, Adam Kwaterko, the Jewish Religious Union with Mozes Finkielstein, the State Jewish Theater and the editorial office of \\"Fołks-Sztyme\\", and most of all participants of the fights: Szymon Datner, Regina Wojskowska, Maryla Różycka, Marek Buch. There were speeches, a transition to other places commemorating the martyrdom of Jews and organized by Patriotic Movement of National Revival, evening at the Białystok Philharmonic.Żydowska społeczność Białegostoku u schyłku swego istnienia (1950–1970), pp. 238-239 ReferencesExternal links *History of the Jews of Bialystok in Sztetel.org.pl Category:History of Białystok Category:Jewish communities in Poland ","title":"History of the Jews in Białystok"},{"id":"64946380","text":"Chirkata () is a rural locality (a selo) in Gumbetovsky District, Republic of Dagestan, Russia.

They were part of the first great Mongol invasion of Europe. The Mongols did not advance far into the Holy Roman Empire and there was no major clash of arms on its territory. Rather, the army that had invaded Poland, after harassing eastern Germany, crossed the March of Moravia in April–May 1241 to rejoin the army that had invaded Hungary. During their transit, they laid waste the Moravian countryside but avoided strongholds. King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia was joined by some German princes, but he monitored the Mongols in Moravia without seeking battle. There were more significant skirmishes in the north of the Duchy of Austria a month later that left several hundred dead, but there was no cooperation between the Austrians and Hungarians. In response to the Mongol threat, the imperial church and the imperial princes held assemblies to organize a military response. Pope Gregory IX ordered the preaching of a crusade and from Italy Emperor Frederick II issued an encyclical to that end. A crusading army under the command of King Conrad IV of Germany mustered on 1 July 1241, but was disbanded a few weeks after setting out because the danger had passed. Although there was no major military action in the Empire, rumours that the Mongols had been checked there spread far beyond the Empire's borders. There are records in several languages from Spain to Armenia of the Bohemian or German king defeating the Mongols and forcing their retreat. In Moravia, a supposed victory over the Mongols took on legendary proportions. In Germany, some contemporary writers attributed the Mongols' general retreat from Europe to the intimidating crusading army. In reality, the Mongols likely spared most of Germany because their primary objective was to punish the Hungarian king for supporting the Cumans. The Mongols raided eastern Austria and southern Moravia again in December 1241 and January 1242. A century later in 1340 they raided the March of Brandenburg. Anti-Mongol crusades were preached within the Empire's borders several times between these two raids, and even as late as 1351. Background The general view in western Europe, since at least 1236, was that the Mongols' ultimate goal was the Holy Roman Empire. This was based partially on intelligence, but mainly on prevailing interpretations of apocalyptic literature. The arrival of the Mongols on the eastern border of the Empire presented the first serious external threat it had faced since the Hungarian invasions in the 10th century. In 1237, King Béla IV of Hungary received a Mongol ultimatum demanding his submission. According to Aubry of Trois-Fontaines, a similar ultimatum was received at the court of Emperor Frederick II, although this is not recorded by anyone else and no such document has survived. Frederick supposedly responded that he would gladly resign his crown if he could become the khan's falconer. The Annales Sancrucenses record that the Mongols also sent ambassadors to Duke Frederick II of Austria demanding his submission. The Mongols entered Hungary on 12 March 1241. Béla IV immediately sent a letter requesting assistance to Duke Frederick. The duke arrived in Pest in the last weeks of March or the first week of April with a small contingent of poorly armed men. Frederick quickly won a small victory, killing two spies attached to the contingent under Shiban. Soon after the Cuman leader Köten was killed. Although the role of Frederick in this is uncertain, he left Pest not long after on bad terms with the Hungarian king. Following the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241, the defeated king of Hungary fled to Austria, crossing the border at Pressburg. Initially welcomed by his erstwhile ally, Duke Frederick imprisoned the king in a castle and extorted the repayment of an indemnity he had been forced to pay the king six years earlier. Béla handed over all the wealth he had with him, including the crown jewels, and was still forced to pawn three counties to the duke. These were probably the three westernmost counties of Moson, Sopron and Vas, which had large German populations. After he was freed, Béla headed for Croatia. Incursions=Moravia As early as 10 March, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, wrote letters to Duke Henry II of Brabant detailing the Mongols' movements across the border in Poland. After the Battle of Chmielnik on 18 March 1241, the Polish duke Bolesław V fled to Moravia. Following victory in the Battle of Legnica on 9 April 1241, Mongol detachments entered the marches of Meissen and Lusatia in eastern Germany. Their attacks are recorded in the Annales sancti Pantaleonis. King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who had raised an army including Thuringian and Saxon reinforcements, was only a day's march away. According to a letter from Bartholomew of Trent to Bishop Egino of Brixen, the Mongols \\"attacked the borders of Bohemia and Saxony\\", but Wenceslaus' cavalry reportedly beat off the Mongol vanguard near Kladsko. A letter from the master of the French Templars to the French king Louis IX at about this time noted that if the armies of Bohemia and Hungary \\"should be defeated, these Tartars will find no one to stand against them as far as\\" France. Realizing that their losses at Legnica had been too heavy for them to confront the Bohemian army, the Mongols did not continue their westward advance, but turned back east. According to Wenceslaus, who wrote letters to the princes of Germany informing them of the Mongols' progress, they were moving at a pace of per day away from the Bohemian border. At the Moravian Gate, they turned south and passed between the ranges of the Sudetes and Carpathians, entering Moravia near Opava. The Moravian Gate (pinked dotted lines) in eastern Moravia and the border of the Empire (black dotted line). The Mongol army at Legnica was under the command of Orda, Baidar and Qadan. Uriyangkhadai, the son of Subutai, was also with them. According to the Chinese History of Yuan, the official history of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Uriyangkhadai took part in the invasion of Poland and the land of the Nie-mi- sz', which word is derived from a name for Germans. It has been estimated at about 8,000 strong. The army as it entered Moravia must have been somewhat smaller. The Franciscan vice-minister in Bohemia, Jordan of Giano, who wrote letters from Prague while the Mongols were in Moravia, indicates that they had passed through the Moravian Gate before 9 May. Other sources place Orda in Hungary by late April, so the transit of Moravia seems to have lasted less than a month. The speed of the transit is mentioned by two other sources: Roger of Torre Maggiore remarked on it and the Annales sancti Panthaleonis note with hyperbole that the Mongols crossed Moravia in one day and night. The Mongols probably exited Moravia through the Hrozenkov pass, what Roger of Torre Maggiore calls the Hungarian Gate. The path they took through Moravia is unknown. They rejoined the main force under Batu Khan outside Trenčín in Hungary. During their transit, the Mongols devastated all of Moravia \\"except for the castles and fortified places\\", according to the Annales sancti Pantaleonis. The only evidence relating to a specific place is a charter of 1247 in which Margrave Ottokar gave the city of Opava some privileges because of the damage the Mongols had caused in the region. All the other charters relating to the destruction of towns and monasteries were forged in the 19th century. No archaeological evidence of the brief Mongol presence in Moravia has yet come to light, nor is Moravia mentioned explicitly in any eastern sources. According to Siegfried of Ballhausen, many Moravian refugees appeared in Meissen and Thuringia. Many others fled into the hills, woods and marshes and hid in caves. Austria The Mongol raiding parties entered Austria from Hungary in late May or early June. They did not cross the Danube in Austria, but they sacked Korneuburg to its north. In a letter to Conrad IV dated 13 June 1241, Duke Frederick II reports on the damage the Mongols inflicted on Austria and estimates that he killed 300 of them on the banks of the Morava. A week later, in a letter to Bishop Henry of Constance dated 22 June 1241, Frederick revises his estimate of casualties upwards to 700 and puts his own dead at 100. This incursion into Austria is also mentioned in the Annales Garstenses, Annales Zwetlenses and Annales Sancrucenses. The first two annals record that the Mongols left Austria unscathed, while the Sancrucenses assign them many dead. The Mongols were probably in Austria as late as July, although already in that month Frederick II was occupying the Hungarian counties that Béla IV had pawned him. In his Chronica majora, Matthew of Paris quotes a letter from a certain Ivo of Narbonne, an eyewitness, who credits King Wenceslaus, Duke Frederick, Patriarch Berthold of Aquileia, Duke Bernard of Carinthia, Margrave Herman V of Baden and the \\"prince of Dalmatia\\" with the relief of Wiener-Neustadt from a besieging Mongol army that came from Hungary. This claim is implausible but not impossible. The Mongols are not known to have crossed the Danube before the winter of 1241/42. Ivo credits the prince of Dalmatia—possibly Duke Otto II of Merania—with capturing eight of the enemy, including an Englishman who had served the Mongols for years and under interrogation revealed much that was not previously known in the West. It has been suggested that the enemy at Wiener-Neustadt was in fact a band of unruly Cumans who had left Hungary following the death of Köten. More plausible is the account in the Tewkesbury Annals and the Chronique rimée of Philippe Mouskès of a victory over the Mongols by Duke Otto II of Bavaria, which nonetheless probably involved no more than a Mongol raiding party. A Mongol army entered western Hungary, eastern Austria and southern Moravia again in late December 1241, as recorded in a letter dated 4 January 1242 from a Benedictine abbot in Vienna, quoted by Matthew of Paris. Rumours In Italy, Filippo da Pistoia, the bishop of Ferrara, circulated a letter he claimed to have received showing that Frederick II had sent envoys to the Mongols and was in league with them. The pope's agents spread similar rumours in Germany. Matthew of Paris records rumours that the Mongols were the Lost Tribes of Israel and were assisted by Jews smuggling arms out of Germany in wine barrels. The Jewish merchants werer said to claim that the barrels were filled with poisoned wine for the invaders. Owing to these rumours, Jews were killed at several customs posts. Response=Anti-Mongol crusade In response to the Mongol threat, German church leaders had held several councils in April 1241, issuing calls for a crusade against the Mongols and enjoining fasting and processions for the defence of Germany and Bohemia. A princely assembly was held at Merseburg, according to the Sächsische Weltchronik and the Annales breves Wormatienses. There is no record of who attended, but Duke Albert of Saxony and Bishop Conrad of Meissen had mustered an army and joined Wenceslaus at Königstein by 7 May. In late April, another assembly was held under the presidency of Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz at Herford (or perhaps Erfurt). Although Siegfried on the advice of the secular princes promulgated instructions for preaching the crusade against the Mongols on 25 April, the Herford assembly did not lead to the formation of an army. Preaching did take place in the archdioceses of Mainz, Cologne and Trier; the diocese of Constance and that of Augsburg, where Bishop Siboto commissioned the friars to preach; and the city of Strasbourg. On 19 May, Conrad IV (only 13 years old) held an assembly at Esslingen where he took the vow of a crusader. His vow committed him only until 11 November 1241. At the same time, Conrad proclaimed a Landfrieden (territorial peace) for all of Germany so that forces could be concentrated against the Mongols. In his letter of 13 June, Duke Frederick explained that he would not join the crusade because he was already engaged with the Mongols, whom he described as a \\"hurricane\\". He asked Conrad IV to have crossbows sent to Germany. He also advised him to bring knights from Swabia, Franconia, Bavaria and the Rhineland to Austria and direct the knights of Saxony, Meissen and Thuringia to Bohemia. From Italy the Emperor Frederick sent a list of instructions for countering the Mongol threat to Germany that specifically included the use of crossbows. These were regarded as sparking terror in the Mongols, who did not possess them. Béla IV warned Conrad IV that the Mongols planned to invade Germany at the beginning of winter in 1241–42. In May 1241, with the Mongol threat on his doorstep, Duke Otto of Bavaria expelled the Papal legate Albert von Behaim from Bavaria in an act of solidarity with Conrad IV and Frederick II amidst their conflict with the Papacy. In late May, Bishop Conrad of Freising wrote to Henry of Constance about the Mongol threat in the Danube valley. He reported that Wenceslaus was avoiding battle because he had been advised to do so by the king of Hungary. Conrad IV set 1 July as the date for the army to assemble at Nuremberg. In June, Pope Gregory IX wrote to several bishops in Germany promoting the preaching of the crusade. The abbot of Heiligenkreuz and the prior of the Dominicans in Vienna were also ordered to preach the crusade in their provinces. According to the Annals of Stade, Gregory had received appeals for the full crusade indulgence from the dukes of Austria and Carinthia. On 19 June, he issued a formal indulgence for the defence of Germany, as he had three days earlier for Hungary. Among those known to have taken a crusader's vow and joined the imperial army are Duke Otto of Brunswick, Archbishop Conrad of Cologne, Count Albert IV of Tyrol, Count Ulrich of Ulten and Count Louis of Helfenstein. The geographical spread of these names suggests that the call for a crusade was widely heeded across Germany. On 20 June, the emperor issued an encyclical from Faenza announcing the fall of Kiev, the invasion of Hungary and the threat to Germany, and requesting each Christian nation to devote its proper quota of men and arms to the defence of Christendom. According to Matthew of Paris's copy of the encyclical, it was addressed to the Catholic nations of France, Spain, Wales, Ireland, England, Swabia, Denmark, Italy, Burgundy, Apulia, Crete, Cyprus, Sicily, Scotland and Norway, with each accorded its own national stereotype. The crusader army assembled as planned at Nuremberg and had advanced as far as Weiden by 16 July. It is unclear if Conrad was marching toward Bohemia or Austria. By this time the Mongols were no longer threatening Germany and consequently the crusade broke up. It did not make contact with the Mongols. According to the Annales breves Wormatienses, the bishops and princes divided the money collected for the crusade between themselves. The rebellion of Conrad's regent in Germany, Siegfried of Mainz, who defected to the papal party, was probably the immediate cause of Conrad's decision to end the crusade. Although the crusade had not met the Mongols in battle, the Annales sancti Trudperti, followed by the Annales Zwifaltenses, attributes the Mongols' subsequent retreat from Europe to the intimidating German army. Nationalist modern historians in Germany or Austria have also fallen on such explanations. In reality, the Mongols probably did not invade Germany in force because their objective was merely to punish the Hungarian king for giving protection to the Cumans. Reports of victory Legendary encounter of Yaroslav and Baidar. From a 19th-century fresco. Despite the lack of contemporary evidence for a major German victory over the Mongols, the rumour that they had received such a check spread as far as the Egypt, Armenia and Muslim Spain. It is recorded in the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria and the Chronological History of Mekhitar of Ayrivank. The Flor des estoires de la terre d'Orient of Hayton of Corycus states that the duke of Austria and the king of Bohemia defeated the Mongols on the Danube and Batu drowned. The Liber secretorum fidelium crucis of Marino Sanudo the Elder also alludes to an Austrian victory on the Danube. The Kitāb al-jughrāfiyya of Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī records that a joint German–Hungarian army defeated the Mongols near Šibenik. Matthew of Paris claims that Conrad IV and his brother, King Enzo of Sardinia, defeated a Mongol army on the banks of the river Delpheos (possibly the Dnieper). In later Moravian historiography, the Mongol invasion of 1241 was conflated with the Hungarian invasion of 1253, which was part of the War of the Babenberg Succession. On the latter occasion, the Hungarian army included pagan Cumans, who were confused with Mongols. The Hungarians besieged Olomouc. They defeated a relief army before lifting the siege. In the Czech Chronicle of Václav Hájek (1541), the Hungarian victory before Olomouc is transformed into a defeat and the leader of the Moravians is Yaroslav of Sternberg. The actual lord of Sternberg Castle at the time was Zdeslav, whose son Yaroslav was probably too young to participate in military action. In the History of the Kingdom of Bohemia of Johannes Dubravius (1552), the siege of Olomouc is moved to 1241 and attributed to the Mongols. Later historians combined these accounts and transformed Yaroslav of Sternberg into a national hero who defeated the Mongols before Olomouc and killed Baidar. In fact, Baidar was still alive in 1246. Later crusades Pope Innocent IV called for a crusade against the Mongols to be preached in Germany in August 1243 and throughout Bohemia and Moravia in the spring of 1253. In June 1258, Pope Alexander IV called for another crusade to be preached in Germany, Bohemia and Moravia. In June 1265, Clement IV, in response to a report he received from Béla IV, ordered the preaching of a new crusade against the Mongols in Austria, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Carinthia and Styria within the Holy Roman Empire. The crusade against the Mongols was rarely promoted thereafter. In 1288, Nicholas IV ordered it preached in Bohemia. John of Winterthur reports attacks on the March of Brandenburg during the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1340. It was also rumoured that the Mongols intended to attack Bohemia, according to the Historia Parmensis of John of Cornazzano. According to Francis of Prague, the Emperor Louis IV refused to aid Poland, but Galvano Fiamma says that \\"numerous Germans\\" joined the defence of Poland, as did the king of Bohemia, John the Blind. Benedict XII, responding to a request from King Casimir III of Poland, ordered the crusade preached in Bohemia in 1340. In March 1351, Clement VI authorised Polish clergy to preach the crusade against the Mongols in Bohemia for the defence of Poland.

Over 35% of the ecoregion experiences flooding during the wet season (August - January).  Location and description  The ecoregion stretches about 400 km from the northern wetlands of Tonle Sap Lake to the salt-water affected mangroves of the Mekong River Delta. The region follows the boundaries of the floodplain of the lake and the Tonle Sap River. The region is flat, although a few hills rise to 300 meters.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (Köppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month.  Flora and fauna  Half of the ecoregion is in use for agriculture. About 20% is forested, mostly in deciduous trees due to the seasonal flooding. Two types of forests are associated with the Tonle Sap floodplains: a stunted swamp forest around the lake (about 10% of the area), and a short tree shrubland for the larger outlying areas. The swamp forest reaches 7-15 meters in height, but the tall trees tend to be spaced out with floating aquatic vegetation in between. Characteristic trees in this swamp forest are Barringtonia acutangula (sometimes called the 'freshwater mangrove') and Diospyros camboniana. The shrubland is dominated by spurge plants (genus Euphorbiaceae), trees of the legume family (genus Fabaceae), and trees of the white mangrove family (genus Combretaceae).

Early life  Darthy was born in 1878.  Career  Darthy was an actress on the Paris stage. She wore costumes by Paquin and Redfern, and was a popular subject of fashion reporting, photography and postcards, with her red hair often featured. Jacques-Émile Blanche painted a portrait of Darthy, hand on hip, wearing a hat with multiple large plumes. In 1910, she was announced as a passenger on a flight from Algiers to Timbuktu, to help publicize a new French air service across the Sahara Desert. During World War I, Darthy was one of the French actresses to pose as \\"La Patrie\\", a personification of France. In 1916, she made her American debut in The Ironmaster by Georges Ohnet, in which the New York Times reported that she had \\"extraordinary emotional powers and a voice whose lovely quality is one of her greatest assets.\\" She was also seen in New York in 1917, starring in Sapho, and in La Rafale by Henri Bernstein. While she was in the United States, she appeared at benefit events for war relief.  Personal life and legacy  Beyond her acting and fashion roles, Darthy was often in headlines for personal scandals. In 1917, Darthy was sued by fellow actress Irène Bordoni for alienation of affections, concerning Bordoni's husband and Darthy's co-star, Edgar Becman. In 1923, she was in a similar situation with fellow actress Cora Laparcerie and her husband Jacques Richepin, though that dispute escalated to physical violence between the women. Later she was involved in solving a mystery surrounding the death of young industrial heir Marc Bellanger. In 1929, she won damages after a car accident caused her injuries and required her to cut her trademark long hair, because \\"she refused to deceive the public by wearing a wig.\\" Darthy died in 1952.

Some common names include the contractile sea cucumber, the sand sifting sea cucumber and the tigertail sea cucumber, and in Hawaii it is known as the light spotted sea cucumber. It is found in the Indo- Pacific region and the Red Sea. Description Holothuria hilla is a cylindrical sea cucumber, tapering slightly at the posterior end. It can grow to a length of about and a diameter of . The integument is thin, soft and wrinkled. The dorsal surface is covered with longitudinal rows of tube feet modified into thorn-like conical papillae with broad bases, sometimes joined in pairs. These are creamy-white, in contrast to the pinkish, golden or brown background colour of the skin. The ventral surface is similar in colour but the papillae are ranged in four or five rows and are longer and yellowish. The mouth is on the underside and is surrounded by a ring of twenty, yellowish peltate tentacles. This species has Cuvierian tubules but does not expel them defensively as do some other species. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the tropical west and central Indo-Pacific oceans, as far east as Hawaii, and even Panama. It is mainly found at less than , but occasionally as deep as , on sandy, rocky and coral substrates, in lagoons, seagrass meadows and flat areas. Ecology Holothuria hilla is a detritivore, raking sand into its mouth with its oral tentacles, extracting and digesting the bacteria, animal and vegetal particles, and voiding the sand through its anus. In this way it churns up significant areas of the seabed. Reproduction is either sexual, when the male and female liberate their gametes into the water column, or asexual, by fission. Sexual reproduction mostly occurs at hotter times of year and asexual reproduction when it is cooler. In Réunion, where the species is rare, fission is the only breeding method that has been observed. The animal stops feeding and conceals itself while splitting; the missing parts regenerate and are often paler in colour than the original parts.

After passing through several schools in and about London, Ramsay was to have gone to Oxford, but was prevented by the civil war. Accordingly he went to St. Andrews, where his studies were broken by the war; he then went to Edinburgh, was driven out by the plague, and returned to London in April 1645. By the end of 1652 he had graduated M.D. at Montpellier, and was living with his father in Holborn. On 31 July he was admitted an extra licentiate of the London College of Physicians.

History In 1745, Demerara was created as a separate colony out of Essequibo, and was initially governed from Essequibo. The colony grew rapidly, and attracted many English planters. In 1755, Gedney Clarke, a Barbados merchant requested political representation, therefore the administration was moved to the island of Borsselen, upriver near plantation Soesdyke which was owned by the Governor Laurens Storm van 's Gravesande. Two administrative buildings, a small fort and barracks were built on the island. The decision was criticised, because the island was hard to defend, and the planters had started to build houses around the guard post near the mouth of the river. In 1765, Jan Cornelis van den Heuvel became governor of Demarara. Van den Heuvel owned plantation de Parel across from the island, but the Dutch West India Company forced him to move to the island with his assistants and clerks. Arguments about the island continued for many years. The settlement near the guard post became known as Stabroek, and in 1782 became the capital of the colony. In 1812, the town was renamed to Georgetown.

It is considered one of the best of Takemitsu's late works.  Conception  From me flows what you call Time was commissioned by the Carnegie Hall Foundation to celebrate Carnegie Hall's centennial season, and was premiered on October 19, 1990 by Nexus and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Seiji Ozawa. The title is taken from the poem \\"Clear Blue Water\\" by Makoto Ōoka, a Japanese poet and a friend of Takemitsu's.  Composition  Takemitsu intended the work to represent the music that had \\"flowed\\" through Carnegie Hall throughout its hundred-year history. As in many of Takemitsu's works, a blend of European and Japanese traditions creates a unique idiom. The piece includes several improvised sections, an element inspired by John Cage's Indeterminacy (music). In the score, Takemitsu noted that \\"the performance should give the impression of being completely improvised.\\" After a brief flute solo at the piece's opening, the five solo percussionists enter the hall. Each is wearing a pocket square of a different color, each meant to represent one of the natural phenomena (blue for water, red for fire, yellow for earth, green for wind, and white for sky). These colors are meant to represent the Tibetan Buddhist principle of Wind Horse. In the same colors are long ribbons, linking the stage to bells and chimes hung from the hall's ceiling. Later in the piece, the ribbons are used by the players to ring these bells.  Structure  The piece is separated into thirteen sections:  Instrumentation  The piece is scored for the following orchestra: = Percussion Soloists = *Percussion I: **Glockenspiel **Vibraphone **Steel drum **2 Crotales *Percussion II: **7 Pakistani Noah bells **5 Thai gongs **Crotalphone **2 Japanese temple bowls on pedal timpani **6 Chinese winter gongs **2 Crotales **Angklung **Darabukka **Wind chimes *Percussion III: **2 Crotales **5 Almglockens **Set of boobam (or log drums) **5 Tom-toms **Angklung **2 Snare drums **Wind Chimes *Percussion IV: **2 Crotales **Glockenspiel **Marimba **3 Tam-tams **3 Suspended cymbals **3 Chinese cymbals **Angklung **Bells *Percussion V: **2 Crotales **Glockenspiel **Marimba **Angklung **2 Japanese temple bowls on pedal timpani = Woodwinds = *3 Flutes (2nd and 3rd doubling piccolo, 3rd doubling alto flute) *3 Oboes (2nd doubling Oboe d'amore, 3rd doubling English Horn) *4 Clarinets (2nd doubling E♭ clarinet, 3rd doubling bass clarinet, 4th doubling contrabass clarinet) *3 Bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon) = Brass = *4 Horns *3 Trumpets *3 Trombones = Harps and Keyboards = *2 Pedal Harps *Celesta = Strings = *Harp *16 Violin I *12 Violin II *10 Violas *8 Cellos *6 Double basses  References  Category:Compositions by Tōru Takemitsu Category:1990 compositions Category:Contemporary classical compositions Category:Percussion concertos Category:Music commissioned by Carnegie Hall ","title":"From me flows what you call Time"},{"id":"64947823","text":"Content in this edit is translated from the existing Hungarian Wikipedia article at hun: Mészáros Lőrinc (vállalkozó); see its history for attribution.

With an estimated wealth of 407.7 billion forint ($1.3 billion) as of 2019, he is according to Forbes, the richest person in Hungary. His personality generates regular social discourse, because from a gas-fitter close to bankruptcy, Mészáros became the richest man of Hungary in a matter of years - what several analysts explain with him having close ties to high ranking members of the Fidesz party. After the 2010 change of government his wealth dubbled yearly, and he became the mayor of the village, where his childhood friend - who won several elections since 2010 and is currently the Prime Minister - Viktor Orbán grew up. This has led to several media outlets calling him Viktor Orbán's strawperson on a regular basis.
