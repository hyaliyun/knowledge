Couples are legally married once they have made the change in status on their family registration sheets, without the need for a ceremony. Most weddings are held either according to Shinto traditions or in chapels according to Christian marriage traditions. Traditionally, marriages were categorized into two types according to the method of finding a partner‚Äîomiai, meaning arranged or resulting from an arranged introduction, and ren'ai, in which the husband and wife met and decided to marry on their own‚Äîalthough the distinction has grown less meaningful over postwar decades as Western ideas of love have altered Japanese perceptions of marriage.Edwards, Modern Japan Through its Weddings.  History  The institution of marriage in Japan has changed radically over the last millennium. Indigenous practices adapted first to Chinese Confucianism during the medieval era, and then to Western concepts of individualism, gender equality, romantic love, and the nuclear family during the modern era. Customs once exclusive to a small aristocracy gained mass popularity as the population became increasingly urbanized.  Heian period (794‚Äì1185)  Genji's son reads a letter. Genji Monogatari Emaki, 12th century handscroll, Gotoh Museum. The Heian period of Japanese history marked the culmination of its classical era, when the vast imperial court established itself and its culture in Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto). Heian society was organized by an elaborate system of rank, and the purpose of marriage was to produce children who would inherit the highest possible rank from the best- placed lineage. It was neither ceremonial nor necessarily permanent. The most weddings were in Edo (Modern day Tokyo). Aristocrats exchanged letters and poetry for a period of months or years before arranging to meet after dark. If a man saw the same woman for a period of three nights, they were considered married, and the wife's parents held a banquet for the couple. Most members of the lower-class engaged in a permanent marriage with one partner, and husbands arranged to bring their wives into their own household, in order to ensure the legitimacy of their offspring. High-ranked noblemen sometimes kept multiple wives or concubines. Aristocratic wives could remain in their fathers' house, and the husband would recognize paternity with the formal presentation of a gift. The forms of Heian courtship, as well as the pitfalls of amorous intrigue, are well represented in the literature of the period, especially The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, The Sarashina Diary, The Pillow Book, and The Tale of Genji.

See Hinamatsuri In pre- modern Japan, marriage was inextricable from the , the basic unit of society with a collective continuity independent of any individual life. Members of the household were expected to subordinate all their own interests to that of the ie, with respect for an ideal of filial piety and social hierarchy that borrowed much from Confucianism.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 15-6. The choice to remain single was the greatest crime a man could commit, according to Baron Hozumi.Hozumi, Nobushige. Ancestor-Worship and Japanese Law. University Press of the Pacific, 2003. . Marriages were duly arranged by the head of the household, who represented it publicly and was legally responsible for its members, and any preference by either principal in a marital arrangement was considered improper. Property was regarded to belong to the ie rather than to individuals, and inheritance was strictly agnatic primogeniture. A woman (Â•≥) married the household (ÂÆ∂) of her husband, hence the logograms for and . In the absence of sons, some households would adopt a to maintain the dynasty, a practice which continues in corporate Japan. Nearly all adoptions are of adult men. Marriage was restricted to households of equal social standing (ÂàÜÈôê), which made selection a crucial, painstaking process. Although Confucian ethics encouraged people to marry outside their own group, limiting the search to a local community remained the easiest way to ensure an honorable match. Approximately one-in-five marriages in pre-modern Japan occurred between households that were already related. Outcast communities such as the Burakumin could not marry outside of their caste, and marriage discrimination continued even after an 1871 edict abolished the caste system, well into the twentieth century. Marriage between a Japanese and non-Japanese person was not officially permitted until 14 March 1873, a date now commemorated as White Day. Marriage with a foreigner required the Japanese national to surrender his or her social standing. Caught in the Act, a hanging scroll by the Kanbun Master, late 1660s, Honolulu Museum of Art. The purposes of marriage in the medieval and Edo periods was to form alliances between families, to relieve the family of its female dependents, to perpetuate the family line, and, especially for the lower classes, to add new members to the family's workforce. The seventeenth-century treatise Onna Daigaku (\\"Greater Learning for Women\\") instructed wives honor their parents-in-law before their own parents, and to be \\"courteous, humble, and conciliatory\\" towards their husbands.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 18, 22. Husbands were also encouraged to place the needs of their parents and children before those of their wives. One British observer remarked, \\"If you love your wife you spoil your mother's servant.\\" The tension between a housewife and her mother-in-law has been a keynote of Japanese drama ever since. played little part in medieval marriages, as emotional attachment was considered inconsistent with filial piety. A proverb said, \\"Those who come together in passion stay together in tears.\\"Tamura, The Japanese Bride, p. 3. For men, sexual gratification was seen as separate from conjugal relations with one's wife, where the purpose was procreation. The genre called celebrated the luxury and hedonism of the era, typically with depictions of beautiful courtesans and geisha of the pleasure districts. Concubinage and prostitution were common, public, relatively respectable, until the social upheaval of the Meiji Restoration put an end to feudal society in Japan.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 19-21. Fukutake, Japanese Rural Society, p. 44.  Meiji Restoration and modernization (1868‚Äì1912)  Sh≈çwa Emperor (Hirohito) with his wife Empress K≈çjun and their children in 1941. During the Meiji period, upper class and samurai customs of arranged marriage steadily replaced the unions of choice and mutual attraction that rural commoners had once enjoyed. Rapid urbanization and industrialization brought more of the population into the cities, ending the isolation of rural life. Public education became almost universal between 1872 and the early 1900s, and schools stressed the traditional concept of filial piety, first toward the nation, second toward the household, and last of all toward a person's own private interests. Marriage under the Meiji Civil Code required the permission of the head of a household (Article 750) and of the parents for men under 30 and women under 25 (Article 772).Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 14, 16-7, 22-3. In arranged marriages, most couples met beforehand at a formal introduction called an , although some would meet for the first time at the wedding ceremony. A visitor to Japan described the omiai as \\"a meeting at which the lovers (if persons unknown to each other may be so styled) are allowed to see, sometimes even to speak to each other, and thus estimate each others' merits.\\" However, their objections carried little weight. The meeting was originally a samurai custom which became widespread during the early twentieth century, when commoners began to arrange marriages for their children through a or matchmaker. The word omiai is still used to distinguish arranged marriages, even when no formal meeting takes place, from .Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 18, 22-3. Courtship remained rare in Japan at this period. Boys and girls were separated in schools, in cinemas, and at social gatherings. Colleagues who began a romantic relationship could be dismissed, and during the Second World War traveling couples could be arrested. Parents sometimes staged an arranged marriage to legitimize a \\"love match,\\" but many others resulted in separation and sometimes suicide.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 24-5. Love was thought to be inessential to marriage. A proposal by Baron Hozumi, who had studied abroad, that the absence of love be made a grounds for divorce failed to pass during debates on the Meiji Civil Code of 1898. One writer observed in 1930, \\"According to the traditional moral ideas, it is deemed a sign of mental and moral weakness to 'fall in love.'\\"Kawashima, Kekkon, pp. 143f. Marriage, like other social institutions of this period, emphasized the subordinate inferiority of women to men. Women learned that as a daughter they ought to obey their father, as a wife their husband, as a widow their sons. Chastity in marriage was expected for women, and a law not repealed until 1908 allowed a husband to kill his wife and her lover if he found them in an adulterous act. The prostitution of women survived the periodic intrusion of puritanical ideals on Japan's less restrictive sexuality.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, p. 21 Divorce laws become more equal over time. During the Edo period, a husband could divorce his wife by writing a letter of his intent to do so, but a wife's only recourse was to flee to a convent. The laws of the early Meiji period established several grounds on which a man could divorce: sterility, adultery, disobedience to parents-in-law, loquacity, larceny, jealousy, and disease. A wife, accompanied by a close male relative, could appeal for divorce if she had been deserted or imprisoned by her husband, or if he was profligate or mentally ill. The 1898 Civil Code established the principle of mutual consent, although the consent of women was still likely to be forced until the early twentieth century, as women gradually gained access to education and financial independence.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 21-2 The fight for divorce rights marked the beginning of Japanese feminism.  Post-war period (1945‚Äìpresent)  Signed after the surrender and occupation of Japan by Allied forces, Article 24 of the Constitution of 1947 reestablished marriage on grounds of equality and choice: \\"Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a base. With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, all laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.\\" A family meal in the 1950s. The Constitution abolished the foundations of the ie system and the patriarchal authority at its heart. Each nuclear family retained, and still retains, a separate family registration sheet, initiated on marriage under the surname of the husband or wife, but the head of each household no longer had any special legal prerogatives over his or her dependents. All legitimate children, male or female, gained an equal right to inheritance, putting an end to primogeniture succession and the obsession with lineage. Women received the right to vote and the right to request a divorce on the basis of infidelity. The Meiji emphasis on Confucian values and national mythology disappeared from education.Hendry, Marriage in Changing Japan, pp. 26-8 The conventional model of the ie was replaced with a new convention, the and the , as the fundamental unit of society.Kelly, William. \\"Finding a Place in Metropolitan Japan: Transpositions of Everyday Life.\\" Ed. Andrew Gordon. Postwar Japan as History. University of California Press, 1993. P. 208-10. New demographic trends emerged, including a later age of marriage and a smaller difference in age between groom and bride, the birth of two children in quick succession, few children born out of wedlock, and a low divorce rate.Coleman, Samuel. \\"The Tempo of Family Formation.\\" Ed. David W. Plath. Work and Lifecourse in Japan. Albany: SUNY Press, 1983. P. 183-214. Lifetime employment became the norm for Japanese men, especially during the post-war economic boom of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. A middle class ideology established a gendered family pattern with separate social spheres: a salaried husband to provide the family income, a housewife to manage the home and nurture the children, and a commitment by the children to education.Schirokauer, Conrad, Miranda Brown, David Lurie, and Suzanne Gay. A Brief History of Chinese and Japanese Civilizations. 4th ed. Boston: Cengage Learning, 2013. P. 609-10. Better health and nutrition meant a rapid extension of life expectancy, and government policies have encouraged people to form to manage a rapidly aging society. Omiai marriages, arranged by the parents or a matchmaker, remained the norm immediately after the war, although the decades which followed saw a steady rise in the number of ren'ai \\"love matches.\\" The distinction between the two has blurred: parents almost always consulted young people before \\"arranging\\" a marriage, and many young people asked an employer or teacher to serve as matchmaker for their \\"love match.\\" Today only one in 20 married couples describe their formation as arranged, and a courtship of several years has become the norm even for relationships that begin with an omiai. Three in five couples meet in the workplace or through friends or siblings.IPSS, \\"Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples\\" (2011), table 1.1, 1.3. Online dating services in Japan gained a reputation as platforms for soliciting sex, often from underage girls, for sexual harassment and assault, and for using decoy accounts (called otori or sakura in Japanese) to string along users in order to extend their subscriptions. Newer services like Pairs, with 8 million users, or Omiai have introduced ID checks, age limits, strict moderation, and use of artificial intelligence to arrange matches for serious seekers. Profiles typically include age, location, height, career, and salary, but can also include interests, hobbies, and familial interests. The term \\"marriage hunting\\" (kekkon katsudo, or konkatsu), has become popular since 2007. It reflects a professional class of matchmaking services which arrange meetings between potential partners, typically through social events, and often includes the exchange of resumes.  Demographic  According to the 2010 census, 58.9% of Japan's adult population is married, 13.9% of women and 3.1% of men are widowed, and 5.9% of women and 3.8% of men are divorced. The annual number of marriages has dropped since the early 1970s, while divorces have shown a general upward trend.  Marriage and fertility  The percentage of births to unmarried women in selected countries, 1980 and 2007. As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of other Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree. The decline of marriage in Japan, as fewer people marry and do so later in life, is a widely cited explanation for the plummeting birth rate. Although the total fertility rate has dropped since the 1970s (to 1.43 in 2013), birth statistics for married women have remained fairly constant (at around 2.1) and most married couples have two or more children. Economic factors, such as the cost of raising a child, work-family conflicts, and insufficient housing, are the most common reasons for young mothers (under 34) to have fewer children than desired.IPSS, \\"Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples\\" (2011), pp. 9-14. The number of single-child or childless couples has increased since 2002 (to 23.3 percent in 2010) even as the desire for larger families remains the same. Only 2% of births occur outside of marriage, compared to 30-60% of births in Europe and North America. This is due to social taboos, legal pressure, and financial hurdles. Half of Japan's single mothers live below the poverty line, among the highest for OECD countries. In addition, an estimated 3.5 million Japanese children, one in six of those below the age of 18, are from households classed as experiencing \\"relative poverty\\" by the OECD.  Fewer marriages  Almost 90% of unmarried Japanese intend to marry,IPSS, \\"Attitudes toward Marriage and Family among Japanese Singles\\" (2011), p. 2. and yet the percentage of people who don't continues to rise. Between 1990 and 2010, the percentage of 50-year-old people who had never married roughly quadrupled for men to 20.1% and doubled for women to 10.6%. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare predicts these numbers to rise to 29% of men and 19.2% of women by 2035. The government's population institute estimated in 2014 that women in their early 20s had a one-in-four chance of never marrying, and a two-in-five chance of remaining childless. Recent media coverage has sensationalized surveys from the Japan Family Planning Association and the Cabinet Office that show a declining interest in dating and sexual relationships among young people, especially among men. However, changes in sexuality and fertility are more likely an outcome of the decline in family formation than its cause. Since the usual purpose of dating in Japan is marriage, the reluctance to marry often translates to a reluctance to engage in more casual relationships. The majority of Japanese people remain committed to traditional ideas of family, with a husband who provides financial support, a wife who works in the home, and two children.IPSS, \\"Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples\\" (2011), p. 9. Labor practices, such as long working hours, health insurance, and the national pension system, are premised on a traditional breadwinner model. As a result, Japan has largely maintained a gender-based division of labor with one of the largest gender pay gaps in the developed world, even as other countries began moving towards more equal arrangements in the 1970s. However, economic stagnation, anemic wage growth, and job insecurity have made it more and more difficult for young Japanese couples to secure the income necessary to create a conventional family, despite their desire to do so. Japan was once well known for lifetime employment, but after the asset price bubble burst and the 1997 Asian financial crisis regular employment for unmarried men age 25-34 dropped from 78% in 1982 to 55% in 2010 as companies began employing more people on temporary or part-time contracts.IPSS, \\"Attitudes toward Marriage and Family among Japanese Singles\\" (2011), pp. 20-21. These non-regular employees earn about 53% less than regular ones on a comparable monthly basis, according to the Labor Ministry, and as primary earners are seven times more likely to fall below the poverty line. Men in this group are more than twice as reluctant to consider marriage,IPSS, \\"Attitudes toward Marriage and Family among Japanese Singles\\" (2011), p. 4. and in their 30s they are about 40% less likely to be married than those with regular employment. According to the sociologist Masahiro Yamada, the failure of conventions to adapt to the economic and social realities of Japanese society has caused a \\"gap in family formation\\" between those who succeed in creating a conventional family and those who remain single and childless.  Later marriages  The average age at first marriage in Japan has climbed steadily from the middle of the 20th century to around 31 for men and 29 for women in 2013, among the highest in Asia. Women postpone marriage for a variety of reasons, including high personal and financial expectations, increasing independence afforded by education and employment, and the difficulty of balancing work and family. Masahiro Yamada coined the term for unmarried adults in their late 20s and 30s who live with their parents, though it usually refers to women. Men who do not aggressively pursue marriage are known as .  International marriages  Of the 660,613 marriages registered in 2013, 21,488 (or about 1 in 30) were between a Japanese and a foreign national, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. The number of international unions rose rapidly in the 1980s and 90s, peaked in 2006 at 44,701 (about 1 in 16), and has declined since then. Changes in the Immigration Control Act in 2005, which made it more difficult for Philippine nationals to work in Japan, are one cause of the decline. Filipino women saw the largest drop, from 12,150 in 2006 to 3,118 or 20.1% of foreign brides in 2013. Many Filipino women come to Japan as entertainers, and some have been victims of domestic violence. The nationality of foreign spouses differs by gender, and Japanese women are more likely to marry partners from outside East and Southeast Asia than Japanese men. Of the 15,442 non-Japanese brides in 2013, most came from China (40.4%), followed by the Philippines (20.1%), South Korea (17.7%), and Thailand (6.3%). The 6,046 grooms came from Korea (27.9%), the United States (19.1%), China (11.8%), and Brazil (4.7%). Many of the Chinese and Korean (Zainichi) nationals included in these statistics have lived in Japan for generations without becoming naturalized citizens. Of the 1 million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or more non-Japanese parent. The rise in international households has sometimes led to conflicts over custody. Biracial Japanese children are often called , although the term has its discontents.  Domestic violence  According to a summary of surveys by Japan's Gender Equality Bureau in 2006, 33.2% of wives and 17.4% of husbands have experienced either threats, physical violence, or rape, more than 10% of women repeatedly. This violence almost always occurred after marriage. Dating abuse has also been reported by 13.5% of women and 5.2% of men.Gender Equality Bureau, Cabinet Office, Survey on Domestic Violence (Tokyo: Gender Equality Bureau, 2006) page 3, 9. (Published in Japanese only, English information available at: or at: )  Marriage law  A marriage is legally recognized once a couple has successfully submitted the required documents to the city hall registrar to change their status in their family registration sheet. No ceremony is required under Japanese law.Embassy of the United States: Japan, Marriage in Japan . Accessed 29 August 2008.Western Style Weddings in Japan: Are they real weddings? Seiyaku.com. Accessed 29 August 2008. The family registration sheet serves as birth certificate, proof of citizenship, marriage license, and death certificate. A register is kept for each nuclear family, under the name of the , with the spouse and unmarried children who are registered as dependents. A couple who marries must file a to create a under a common surname. Since 1947, couples have been permitted to choose either the surname of the husband or wife, consistent with a ban on separate surnames first imposed in 1898. Married couples are estimated to choose the man's surname 95% of the time, although some women continue to use their maiden name informally. The ban has survived several legal challenges on the basis of gender inequality, most recently in 2015. When marriage is used to adopt a male heir, the husband takes his wife's family name. International marriages are subject to separate rules within Japan. Foreigners in Japan do not have their own family registration sheet, and therefore those who marry a Japanese national are listed on his or her family's sheet. Foreign spouses in Japan are eligible for a long-term dependent visa. Children born out of wedlock are recorded as illegitimate on their mother's family register, although they can be legitimized by a later acknowledgment of paternity. Illegitimate children were eligible for half the inheritance of legitimate ones until a court ruling in 2013. Wedding ceremonies A bride in Tsunokakushi and shiromuku at Tokyo's Meiji Shrine. A common description of Japan's religious syncretism says: \\"Born Shinto, married Christian, die Buddhist.\\" In practice, however, elements of all three major traditions tend to be practiced side-by-side. Japanese weddings usually begin with a Shinto or Western Christian-style ceremony for family members and very close friends before a reception dinner and after- party at a restaurant or hotel banquet hall. There the couple's extended families and friends make speeches and offer in a special envelope. Close family pay about twice as much as friends. Japanese Shinto ceremonies Traditional , which account for around one in six of Japanese weddings, are held in the main building of a shrine. A priest performs a ritual purification for the couple, then announces their marriage to the of the shrine and asks for their blessing. The bride and groom take three sips each from three cups of sake, a ritual called . Japanese brides, sometimes painted white as a sign of purity before the gods, wear a kimono which is either , , or , the black and patterned kimono once worn at weddings of the nobility during the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), with either an open white or a . Grooms wear a black crested jacket and loose, skirt-like with a vertical stripe. Christian chapel ceremonies A Christian wedding in Kyoto. Christian wedding ceremonies have since the mid-1990s displaced the Shinto rite and continue to remain Japan‚Äôs wedding ceremony of choice.LeFebvre, J. (2015). Christian wedding ceremonies: \\"Nonreligiousness\\" in contemporary Japan. Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, 42(2), 185-203. Christian wedding ceremonies have in the last thirty years moved from the sideline to the mainstream of Japanese society. The popularity of Christian wedding ceremonies represents new widespread acceptance, commercialization, and popularity of a religious ceremony. The postwar history of Christian wedding ceremonies is best understood in light of the efforts made by traditional Christian churches and the bridal industry to meet the religious needs and demands of Japan‚Äôs largely \\"nonreligious\\" (mush≈´ky≈ç) constituency.LeFebvre, \\"Christian Wedding Ceremonies-- 'Nonreligiousness\\" in Contemporary Japan\\". Although the Japanese have unprecedented access to the Catholic Church, the majority of weddings in Japan follow the Protestant liturgy. As such the ceremony includes elements typical to a traditional Protestant wedding including hymns, benedictions, prayers, bible readings, an exchange of rings, wedding kiss, and vows before God. It is typical for a bride to enter with her father and then be \\"given away\\" to her husband‚Äîan exchange that usually involves bowing and shaking hands. In recent years, the custom of lowering the veil has also become popular. During the veil lowering the mother of the bride lowers the veil for her daughter before she continues down the \\"virgin road\\" with her father toward her husband. In the case of a non-Japanese wedding minister, the ceremony is commonly performed in a mix of Japanese and a western language (typically, English). Non-religious or civil ceremonies Non-religious or civil ceremonies often take place in a banquet hall, before or during the reception party, with a Master of Ceremonies officiating and guests seated around tables. Although these ceremonies often adopt Western elements, especially a wedding dress for the bride and a tuxedo for the groom, they forego any religious connotations.

It was to protect the settlers there from attacks by Border Ruffians and Indians. The fort consisted of three or four officer cabins, a redoubt about a quarter of a mile to the north and a parade ground a mile to the east. The redoubt was an earthwork and log structure. Historian Daniel C. Fitzgerald visited the ruins of the redoubt and reported it to be rectangular, 150 feet by 60 feet across. The earthworks were the base of the structure. On top of the earthworks were four layers of logs. The wall was said to be fairly high. A house was built in the center of the redoubt. Fort Belmont was manned by local militia under the command of Capt. Joseph Gunby. A Federal agency for the Osage and Creek Indians was located at Fort Belmont until 1864, possibly until October. In 1861 Creek Indian leader Opothleyahola led around 10,000 followers to Kansas to escape the pursuit of Confederates in present-day Oklahoma. Little protection was offered to them at Fort Row in Wilson County, so the survivors were moved to Fort Belmont where more than 240 refugees died during the winter of 1861/62 when the Union army was unable to provide sufficient food and shelter; their unmarked graves, including those of Opotheleyahola and his daughter, are nearby. On October 30, 1864, Gov. Thomas Carney relieved the militia from duty and Fort Belmont was permanently closed. The town of Belmont was abandoned soon thereafter.Daniel C.

The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994.  Design  Based on the basic button configuration established with Nintendo's Super NES Controller, the PlayStation controller added a second pair of shoulder buttons for the middle fingers. Intended to update the gamepad for navigating 3D environments such as the ones PlayStation was designed to generate, the concept behind featuring shoulder buttons for both the index and middle fingers was to implement two-way directional depth controls using the two sets of buttons. To compensate for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers' placement to the shoulders, grip handles were added to the controller. Using the simple geometric shapes of a green triangle, a red circle, a blue cross, and a pink square (Triangle, Circle, Cross, Square) to label its action buttons rather than traditionally used letters or numbers, the PlayStation controller established a trademark which would be incorporated heavily into the PlayStation brand. In an interview with Teiyu Goto, designer of the original PlayStation controller, he explained what the symbols mean: the circle and cross represent \\"yes\\" and \\"no,\\" respectively (which explains their common use as \\"confirm\\" and \\"cancel\\" in games; this layout is reversed in Western games); the triangle symbolizes a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper there to be used to access menus. The PlayStation 2 console is backward-compatible with the original PlayStation controller.  History  Ken Kutaragi recounted the designing of the controller: Both Goto and Kutaragi recalled that Sony president Norio Ohga showed a special interest in the development of the controller, and strongly supported the final version. On April 2, 1996, Sony released a revised version of the PlayStation controller (model SCPH-1080), which is 10% larger than the launch model and features a longer cord with a ferrite bead. This model was bundled with all subsequent PlayStation consoles including North American launch models. After briefly selling the Dual Analog Controller in 1997, Sony began phasing out the PlayStation controller later that year with the introduction of the DualShock controller, which would become the new standard controller for the PlayStation, although the first game to require its use, Ape Escape, would only be released two years later.

He founded the firm M R Hornibrook Pty Ltd that after merger with Baulderstone became one of the largest Australian civil engineering firms. Known as \\"MR\\", Hornibrook was knighted in 1960. He was highly respected and a builder of bridges across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Papua New Guinea as well as other major projects including Stages 2 (the Sails) and 3, of the Sydney Opera House.  Early life  As one of seven children of Catherine Hornibrook, Manuel was educated at Nambour, Obi Obi, Bowen Bridge and South Brisbane state schools.  Building (and Engineering) career  At the age of 13 Hornibrook commenced apprenticeship with builder HW Fooks. In 1912, at the age of 19, Manuel with his brother Reginald established their own business which started with building drainage channels and sewerage systems. Soon the bridge building became Hornibrook's speciality. The business quickly moved into civil engineering contracting, excavating the State's first open cut coal mine at Blair Athol in 1923. The William Jolly bridge built from 1930-1932 became his all-time favourite project because of the aesthetic appeal of the bridge and the pioneering use of the sand island method of pier construction. In 1914 Hornibrook had joined the Queensland Master Builders' Association and was its president in 1922 and 1923; he was president (1926) and a life member (1959) of the Master Builders Federation of Australia; he was also a foundation fellow (1951), councillor and National President (1952-56) of the Australian Institute of Builders (now Building), and a driving force in the construction of its headquarters at Milson's Point, Sydney. For his contribution to the science and the practice of building, he was awarded the A.I.B.'s first medal of merit (the AIB Medal, 1955). President (1953-59) of the Queensland Civil Engineering Contractors' Association, he was an honorary member (1968) of the Australian Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors and an honorary fellow (1969) of the Chartered Institute of Building (Britain)‚Äîthe first Australian to be so honoured. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) in 1957 and knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in 1960. Sir Manuel Hornibrook was the Chief Engineer during construction of the Hornibrook Bridge which was named after him. Sir Manuel was posthumously inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2016.

It was recorded in Brazil and produced by Brazilian musician Jaques Morelenbaum. Background and development Transparente was recorded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the direction of Brazilian cellist, arranger and Grammy-winning music producer Jaques Morelenbaum. Mariza has claimed to be a long time fan of Morelenbaum's work, and wished to create at least a song with him. When invited by Mariza to arrange her new album, Morelenbaum could not recuse himself, stating that despite fado being a foreign genre to him, it reminded him \\"that Brazil is steeped in Portuguese culture\\". Composition For Transparente, Mariza once again chose to feature both original songs and adaptations to traditional fados, a practice she follows since the release of her first studio album, Fado em Mim. The song \\"Malmequer\\" is an adaptation by Aldina Duarte to the traditional Fado Menor, whereas \\"Toada do desengano\\" is a work by Vasco Gra√ßa Moura based on Fado Franklin. M√°rio Ra√≠nho also contributed with his \\"Recusa\\", having developed the song from Fado Magala. The singer has stated that since she does not know how to write songs, she feels the need \\"to resort to the great poets and ask for help from composers and singer-songwriters\\" when working on new projects. This album follows this trend, once again featuring content by Fernando Pessoa, Florbela Espanca and Artur Ribeiro.Elliott, pp. 152-153 The album's homonymous song \\"Transparente\\" was written for Mariza by poet Paulo Abreu Lima, and with the idea of accentuating the singer's mixed heritage. It would feature in the 2011 album The Rough Guide to World Playtime, being described as having a \\"delicate beauty that is instantly infectious\\". Transparente breaks with the fado tradition of accompanying the vocals only with a 12-string Portuguese guitar, by featuring instruments like the flute, the cello or the accordion. Critical reception Transparente received positive reviews from music critics, both in Portugal and internationally. Between 2005 and 2006, Mariza embarked on a world tour to promote the album. When writing about a live concert in Lisbon following the release of Transparente, Nuno Galopim of Di√°rio de Not√≠cias considered the album to be \\"magnificent\\", with a \\"discreet and engaging\\" sound. Covering a performance at the Teatro Alb√©niz in Madrid, Carlos Galilea of El Pa√≠s pointed out the unusual instruments that featured in the album, arguing that they contributed to create a new, \\"extremely beautiful\\" sound. The critic asserted that although this approach to the genre may seem like a deviation from the roots of fado itself, Mariza was closer to fado than ever. In his review of the event, Galilea also praised the reference to the work of Fernando Pessoa, the \\"greatest poet born in Portugal\\", in the song \\"H√° uma M√∫sica do Povo\\". Clive Davis gave a very complimentary review of the album's music when covering Mariza's 2006 concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In June 2017, the album was included in Blitz's list of the 30 best Portuguese albums of the last 30 years. Commercial performance The album had sold more than 15.000 copies in the Netherlands as of February 2006, becoming a golden record in the country. By that time, Transparente was already a double platinum record in Portugal, selling more than 40.000 copies since its release and, by December 2010, the album was a triple platinum record with more than 60.000 copies sold. Transparente also featured for four weeks in France's top albums chart, having peaked at number 126 on April 2005. Transparente became Mariza's second album to feature on Billboard's World Albums chart, where it peaked at number 7 in October 2005. In June 2005, the album had also ranked number 7 in the World Music Charts Europe, compiled monthly by the European Broadcasting Union, by then the highest position ever achieved by a Portuguese album. The album ranked number 28 in the 2005 overall list by the same organization.

Cand√®s is a 2017 MacArthur Fellow. Academic biography Cand√®s earned a M.Sc. from the √âcole Polytechnique in 1993.Speaker bio from NIPS 2008. He did his postgraduate studies at Stanford, where he earned a Ph.D. in statistics in 1998 under the supervision of David Donoho, and immediately joined the Stanford faculty as an assistant professor of statistics. He moved to the California Institute of Technology in 2000, where in 2006 he was named the Ronald and Maxine Linde Professor of Applied and Computational Mathematics. He returned to Stanford in 2009. Research Cand√®s' early research concerned nonlinear approximation theory. In his Ph.D. thesis, he developed generalizations of wavelets called curvelets and ridgelets that were able to capture higher order structures in signals. This work has had significant impact in image processing and multiscale analysis, and earned him the Popov prize in approximation theory in 2001.The Vasil A. Popov Prize: Emmanuel Candes, 2001, Third Prize Recipient, Mathematics Department, University of South Carolina. In 2006, Cand√®s wrote a paper with Terence Tao. that kicked off the field of compressed sensing: the recovery of sparse signals from a few carefully constructed, and seemingly random measurements. Many researchers have since contributed to this field, which has brought us the idea of a camera that can record pictures while needing only one sensor,.. and tools for designing distributed sensors that can communicate cheaply. Awards and honors In 2001 Cand√®s received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. He was awarded the James H. Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing in 2005. In 2006, he received the Vasil A. Popov Prize as well as the National Science Foundation's highest honor: the Alan T. Waterman Award for research described by the NSF as \\"nothing short of revolutionary\\".Candes to Receive Waterman Award, American Mathematical Society, 2006. In 2010 Cand√®s and Terence Tao were awarded the George P√≥lya Prize. In 2011, Cand√®s was awarded the ICIAM Collatz PrizeICIAM announces prizes for 2011 , SIAM, 2010. Cand√®s has also received the Lagrange Prize in Continuous Optimization, awarded by the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).

The decision has widely influenced jurisprudence on vicarious liability outside of Canada.See for example: Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, [2001] UKHL 22; and New South Wales v Lepore, [2003] HCA 4. Facts The Children's Foundation is a provincially funded, non-profit organization which operated two residential care facilities for children aged six to twelve. In April 1966, the foundation employed Leslie Charles Curry to work in its Vancouver home, where he was hired as a childcare counsellor practising \\"total intervention\\" in the lives of the children he was caring for. He worked there until March 1980, when the Foundation received a complaint. They investigated and discovered that Curry was in fact a paedophile and had been abusing the children under his care. In 1990 he was charged with 18 counts of gross indecency and two counts of buggery, and was convicted on all but one count, two of those convictions were in relation to the respondent in this case, Patrick Allen Bazley. Curry died not long thereafter. In this case, Bazley sought damages from The Children's Foundation, alleging that they are vicariously liable for the misconduct of its employee. The main issue in this appeal was whether or not the Children's Foundation should be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employee. There were two questions before the court: May employers be held vicariously liable for sexual assaults on clients or persons within their care?; If so, should non-profit organizations be exempted from liability as a matter of policy? Judgment The Supreme Court was cautious to allow vicarious liability to be attached to a non-profit organization. McLachlin J (as she then was) points out that vicarious liability is a form of strict liability, or no-fault liability. The Court was very openly concerned with policy in this decision as vicarious liability can be used by litigants to \\"sue into deeper pockets\\" even though the litigant may be suing an employer that is not at fault. McLachlin J surveyed a number of possible policy reasons for the imposition of vicarious liability and adopted two of J. G. Fleming's policy rationales: ::(1) providing a just and practical remedy, and ::(2) deterring future harm.Bazley v Curry, [1999] 2 SCR 534 at para 29. See also Test for vicarious liability In determining if an employer can be found vicariously liable, courts will often use the Salmond test, which will find an employer liable for the actions of an employee which are: ::(1) acts authorized by the employer or ::(2) acts which are not authorized by the employer, but are so connected to authorized acts that they may be considered \\"modes\\" of acts authorized by the employer. The Supreme Court here seems to express frustration at this test. It is possible to view Curry's actions either completely independently, or as a mode of performing an authorized act. The Salmond test does not give clear criterion for how differentiate these two. As such, the court clarified the test, saying that the court should consider: ::(1) policy reasons in determining that vicarious liability should or should not apply ::(2) whether the wrongful act is sufficiently related to the employment to justify imposing vicarious liability. The court went on to explain that vicarious liability is generally appropriate where there is a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of risk and the wrong that flows from the risk. It will not be enough that the wrong took place on company property or through incidental connections. In this case, because Curry was left alone for long periods of time unsupervised with his victims, was expected to bathe them and was placed by the foundation in a position of power over them, it can be said that there was a strong connection between what the employer was asking the employee to do and the wrongful act committed. The foundation significantly increased the risk of harm, and as such, should be found vicariously liable for Mr. Curry's actions. Exception for non-profits? The Foundation made three arguments that as a non-profit it should not be found vicariously liable :* it is unfair to fix liability without fault on non-profit organizations performing needed services on behalf of the community as a whole :* non-profit charitable organizations often work with volunteers and are thus less able than commercial enterprises to supervise what their agents do :* vicarious liability will put many non-profit organizations out of business or make it difficult for them to carry on their good work McLachlin dismissed these arguments as \\"crass and unsubstantiated utilitarianism\\" and pointed out: The appeal was dismissed and the matter was sent back to trial to determine costs.

The album was a commercial failure and featured no hit singles, despite the release of three singles the same year; \\"Not the Only One\\", \\"No Time\\" and \\"Standing at the Top of the World\\". Background Following the commercial disappointment of the band's 1984 debut album Throw the Warped Wheel Out, the band underwent a major change in personnel, as members keyboardist and writer Eddie Jordan, drummer Mike Ogletree and bassist Graham McGregor left the band. These departures left lead vocalist Kevin Patterson and guitarist Chic Medley as the two remaining members, who in turn hired guest musicians for the recording of the second Fiction Factory album, including keyboardist Paul Wishart, guitarist Pim Jones, percussionist James Locke and bass player Graham Weir. Medley produced the album, with Patterson as assistant producer, and both wrote the entire album's worth of material either together or solely (except \\"Lose Your Heart in Nature\\" which was credited also to Wishart). The album was recorded at The Planet, Castle Sound and Amazon Studios, Liverpool, while it was mixed at Castle Sound and Amazon Studios. It was mastered at Ham Audio. Another Story was released in 1985. The album spawned three singles; \\"Not the Only One\\", \\"No Time\\" and \\"Standing on Top of the World\\". The closing track \\"Victoria Victorious\\" featured Fiona Carlin on lead vocals, though she has never featured on any other recording or release before or since. All singles from the album received very limited promotion, with no music videos being made, nor any TV appearances featuring the band performing the material, except for one performance of \\"Not the Only One\\" on the German show Musik Convoy in May 1985. The band did perform a small number of UK concerts to promote the release of the album. Shortly following the commercial failure of the album, Fiction Factory disbanded. After this, Medley worked on various musical projects and with numerous bands, while Patterson became briefly involved as a music producer before leaving the music industry to being working in the IT department at the University of Dundee. Aside from the lack of commercial success, Fiction Factory also felt they never managed to create something that was as good as \\"(Feels Like) Heaven\\", and that all they did was measured against it. Patterson later recalled: \\"We could never shake that one song.\\" Years later, Patterson also stated in an interview that he wanted to record \\"Another Story\\" as an end to the band as he had had enough of music, living with stress and constantly writing songs, so he disbanded the group. In 2007 the band briefly reunited, only consisting of Patterson and Jordan to perform \\"(Feels Like) Heaven\\" with a backing band at Jordan's wedding in August 2007. In 2011, the original band reunited to play live at the Rewind Festival. Release The album was released in Europe only and did not feature an American release. In Europe, the album was released through Foundry Recordings/Virgin Records, however in Germany the album was issued via Instant Records. For some versions of the album, marketing was handled by RCA Records (RCA Schallplatten GmbH), others both marketing and distribution was handled by Line Music GmbH. The album soon became out of print. Another Story was only released as a vinyl LP, except in Germany where Instant Records gave a limited pressing on CD. The CD release also became out of print and today is a collectors item, often selling for prices up to ¬£500. The CD version of Another Story featured two bonus tracks; \\"Not the Only One (Long Version)\\", which was the \\"Extended Mix\\" found on the 12\\" vinyl version of the \\"Not the Only One\\" single and \\"Let Me Be a Part\\", which was the \\"Not the Only One\\" b-side. Although both bonus tracks aren't listed on the album's back insert, they are listed on the disc. For the majority of the album's editions, the artwork featured a purple-like background colour, however the artwork was changed for some editions and used a blue background colour instead, although the design otherwise remained the same. It is reported that the album's backing vocalist Marwenna Laidlaw is the woman posing on the front cover of the album. The photography was created by David McIntyre, who had also done the band's debut album. The sleeve was designed by myIDEA. The picture was taken in McIntyre's apartment in London. Patterson later recalled \\"We just asked David to come up with an interesting picture (which he did in his flat in London). We did not give him any ideas and we did not see what he was doing... he just presented it to us when he had finished.\\"http://www.musikalske.net/fiction_factory/fiction_factory.htm Singles \\"Not the Only One\\", the lead single from Another Story, was released in Europe, mainly the UK, Germany and Italy via Foundry Records as well as Canada via Virgin Records. It was issued on both 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl, with the 12\\" vinyl featuring an extended version of the song (titled \\"Extended Mix\\", but known as \\"Long Version\\" on the Another Story CD), and \\"Not the Only One ('Mix' Mix)\\", a remix which most notably removed all lead vocal. The single \\"No Time\\" was released in the UK only via Foundry Records on both 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl. The single featured the exclusive b-side \\"Tension\\" however this track was not included as a bonus on the CD release of Another Story. The 12\\" vinyl release would feature extended versions of both the A-side and the B-side. \\"Standing at the Top of the World\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl via Foundry Records and Centre Records in Australia only. \\"Not the Only One\\" was the B-Side.http://www.discogs.com/Fiction-Factory-Standing-At-The-Top-Of-The- World/release/5150249 Track listing Personnel  * Kevin Patterson - lead vocals, performer, assistant producer, engineer, programming * Chic Medley - guitar, performer, producer, engineer, programming * Marwenna Laidlaw - backing vocals * Graham Weir - brass * Pim Jones - guitar * Paul Wishart - keyboards * Fiona Carlin - lead vocals on \\"Victoria Victorious\\" * James Locke - percussion * Pete Coleman - engineer * HA (Peter Harenberg) - mastering * Gordian Troeller, Steve Baker - management * David McIntyre - photography * myIDEA - sleeve design References Category:1985 albums Category:Fiction Factory albums ","title":"Another Story (Fiction Factory album)"},{"id":"25876362","text":"CFS Chibougamau, or RCAF Station Chibougamau (pre-1967), housed the 10 Radar Squadron (Royal Canadian Air Force).

Originally conceived and started by local politicians and trustees, in 2009 the trails became one of the seven Quick Start Projects that form the beginning of the New Zealand Cycle Trail. The trail is proposed to be 100 km long, out of which 50 km existed before the NZCT scheme was created. In mid-2011, work on the last sections of the cycle trail project sections was begun, while the official grand opening occurred early November 2011. Location The trails are located in the Waikato Region along the Waikato River. They pass through the districts of South Waikato, Otorohanga and Taupo. At present, seven trails exist. They are: Arapuni Village to Arapuni Dam, Arapuni Dam to Jones Landing, Whakamaru Dam to Whakamaru Reserve, Ongaroto Bluffs Trail, Whakamaru Christian Camp to Snowsill, Dunham Creek Mobility Trail and the Atiamuri Trail Trail Information ‚Äì Waikato River Trails official website The Whakamaru Christian Camp to Snowsill trail is approximately 3 km long and takes around half an hour to walk.http://grrrsmind.blogspot.com/2011/01/waikato-river-trails-whakamaru.html The Whakamaru Camp is also a great place to camp at. History In September 2003, the South Waikato Economic Development Trust established a Waikato River Trail Management Group. The Waikato River Trails Trust managing the trail was incorporated on 3 February 2006. In 2004, a 3 km trail from Arapuni Dam to Jones Landing was opened, marking the start of the construction project. On 10 November 2009, Prime Minister John Key officially launched the construction of the first New Zealand Cycle Trail project at the Little Waipa Reserve adjacent to the Waikato River. This site, on Horahora Road, has now gone down in history as the spot where turf was first turned on the first of seven of the Government‚Äôs Quick Start projects. The first contract was signed in April 2010, assigning $3.4 million from the cycle trail fund to construct the last 41 km of the 100 km distance. In addition, it is estimated that volunteer and in-kind work was donated to a total of $1.5 million. The opening was scheduled to be in time for the 2010 World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro, near Cambridge, New Zealand from 29 October ‚Äì 7 November. The trail is conservatively attract about 20,000 people per year, with much of the visitors coming from the Auckland and Waikato regions. Trail description Dunham Creek Mobility Trail as part of the Waikato River Trails Originally, the trail was envisaged as a walking track only. When users started cycling the sections that had been opened, the scope was widened for the trail to be of dual use for pedestrians and cyclists. For cycling, the target market is family off- road usage with a mountain biking grade of 2‚Äì3. One section of the trail at Dunham Creek is suitable for wheelchair access. As of early 2010, 30 km of trails are already open for use, 23 km are built but yet to be opened, 6 km are under construction and a further 41 km are planned to be constructed during 2010. As at 2 September 2011 ‚Äì The section of the WRT between the Mangakino Lakefront Reserve, and the new swing bridge over the Mangakino Stream is nearing completion. From the swing bridge, the trail is completed through to the Whakamaru Reserve and onward to the Whakamaru Dam. The trust also planted 6,000 native trees as part of riparian restoration along the trail, as well as erecting 18 km of fencing to protect the river from direct impacts of dairy farming. Attractions At 425 km, the Waikato River is New Zealand's longest river. The Waikato River has spiritual meaning for various local MƒÅori tribes including the large Tainui, who regard it as a source of their mana or pride. There are several hydro lakes along this stretch of the Waikato River: *Lake Atiamuri was formed behind the Atiamuri Power Station. *Lake Whakamaru was formed behind the Whakamaru Power Station. *Lake Maraetai is a sheltered and scenic lake of 4.4 km2 close to the town of Mangakino. At the lakefront reserve in Mangakino you will find the iconic Bus Stop Cafe. There is plenty of parking and free camping for tents and campervans. BBQ, power and toilets available. *Lake Waipapa is located where the Waipapa River flows into the Waikato River. *Lake Arapuni is formed by the Arapuni Dam. *Lake Karapiro was the last of the eight hydroelectric power stations built on the Waikato River, created in 1947. The Arapuni Suspension Bridge, a popular tourist destination with a span of 152 m, is located just downstream from the Arapuni Power Station. The Taniwha is a Multi Sport Event utilising the WRT. Distances from 7‚Äì88 km for bikers, runners and walkers this great event normally runs in November. Corporate sponsorship Mercury Energy, the owner and operator of the hydroelectric generating stations on the Waikato River, is a major sponsor of the Waikato River Trails Trust.

The ecoregion covers most of the Italian Peninsula, and includes evergreen and deciduous forests. Geography The ecoregion extends from the southern Po Basin in northern Italy to the southern Apennine Mountains of Basilicata and Calabria. It covers the lowlands of central Italy, including the valleys of the Arno and Tiber rivers, the Tyrrhenian Sea (western) coast of central Italy and Liguria extending into southeastern France, and central Italy's Adriatic coast, as well as the middle elevations of the Appenines. The Appenines' higher- elevation montane forests are considered separate ecoregions ‚Äì the Appenine deciduous montane forests in central Italy, and South Apennine mixed montane forests in southern Italy. The coastal lowlands and foothills of Campania, Calabria, and Puglia in southern Italy are part of the Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion.\\"Italian sclerophyllous and semi- deciduous forests\\". Encyclopedia of Earth. Accessed 13 September 2020. Rock types are limestone, dolomite, marl, schist-marl, and sandstone. Cities in the ecoregion include Rome, Florence, Genoa, and Nice. Flora The forests vary in species composition with elevation and soils. Lower elevation forests are dominated by sclerophyllous evergreen oaks, including holm oak Quercus ilex, often on limestone-derived soils, and cork oak Quercus suber, often on soils derived from volcanic rocks. They are accompanied by deciduous trees such as: Quercus pubescens, Fraxinus ornus, Ostrya carpinifolia, Celtis australis, Acer monspessulanum, Carpinus orientalis, and Crataegus monogyna. At middle elevations, forests are predominatly deciduous oaks, including Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, and Quercus frainetto, with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and Ostrya carpinifolia. In the highest portions of the Appenines, the sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests transition to the Apennine deciduous montane forests and South Apennine mixed montane forests, which are dominated by deciduous European beech (Fagus sylvatica), together with other deciduous broadleaf trees and conifers. The ecoregion is home to thousands of plant species, with over 2000 on the Gargano Peninsula alone. Endemic species are from 10 to 20% of the total, and occur from sea level up to the high mountains. The ecoregion's orchids are diverse, particularly in the mountains; the Maiella Mountains have 60 known species, and the Gargano Mountains have 56 species. Conservation and threats Much of the ecoregion is still forested. There are areas of old-growth forest in relatively inaccessible mountains, and larger areas of coppice woodlands, many of which are no longer harvested and are regenerating naturally. Grazing and timber harvesting has altered the forest structure and species composition across much of the ecoregion. Population is concentrated in cities, valleys, and along the coast, and much of the countryside is thinly populated. Many rural areas have been abandoned since World War II as Italy urbanized and industrialized. Protected areas * A 2017 assessment found that 18,302 km¬≤, or 18%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Gargano National Park, Alta Murgia National Park, Cinque Terre National Park, Capanne di Marcarolo Natural Park, and Bracciano-Martignano Regional Park.UNEP-WCMC (2020).

Farmers are protected from the volatile prices on the world market through the price- fixing. Besides the higher quality hybrid seeds are sold by the organization and some research on cocoa plant-related diseases are also carried out. Between 1947 and 1979, the institution was known as the Cocoa Marketing Board. History=Background In 1937, farmers in Gold Coast, a colony of the British Empire equal to contemporary Ghana, refused to continue selling cocoa at the low prices set by European merchants and decided to withhold cocoa from the market. The strike went on for 8 months, until the British government acted by setting up the Nowell Commission of Enquiry to investigate the issue. The Nowell Commission report advised the government to assist cocoa farmers by establishing a Marketing Board. West African Produce Control Board (1940-1946) In 1940, the government established the West African Produce Control Board to purchase cocoa under guaranteed prices from all West African countries. It operated throughout World War II and was dissolved in 1946. Cocoa Marketing Board (1947-1979) The first attempt to regulate market value and production was in 1947 through the Ghana Marketing Board, which dissolved in 1979 and was reconciled into Ghana Cocoa Board also called Cocobod . The Ghana Marketing Board was established by ordinance in 1947 with the sum of 27 million Ghanaian Cedi as its initial working capital. In 1979, this Board was dissolved and reconstituted as the Ghana Cocoa Board. Ghana Cocoa Board (1979-) In 1984 Cocobod underwent institutional reform aimed at subjecting the cocoa sector to market forces. Cocobod's role was reduced, and 40 percent of its staff, or at least 35,000 employees, were dismissed. Furthermore, the government shifted responsibility for crop transport to the private sector. Subsidies for production inputs (fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, and equipment) were removed, and there was a measure of privatization of the processing sector through at least one joint venture. In addition, a new payment system known as the Akuafo Check System was introduced in 1982 at the point of purchase of dried beans. Ghana's Government implemented a very strategic plan in 1984 putting the sale of agriculture particularly Cocoa in the hands of the Government. With the regulation of pricing and manufacturing controlled by the government over 30,000+ jobs were lost but Ghana still holds its spot as one of three highest yielding countries of Cocoa. Jointly with C√¥te d'Ivoire's Coffee and Cocoa Council (both countries were enemies for years), agreed and announced, on June 11, 2019, a minimal price for cocoa, in order to protect producers.Parellada, G.

Uses in the New Testament Modern English translations of the Greek New Testament use the word \\"repentance\\" for both the word metanoia and metamelomai. The former term is so translated almost ten times as often as the latter.Wilkin, Robert N. \\"New Testament Repentance: Lexical Considerations\\", Bible.org Metanoia can be traced to Mark Chapter 1, where Jesus announces that the kingdom of God is at hand and asks for repentance. Matthew 27:3 uses the Greek verb metamelomai in stating that Judas \\"repented himself\\" after he saw Jesus being led away. Metamelomai denotes \\"painful sorrow\\" or \\"remorseful regret.\\" According to James Glentworth Butler, \\"as nearly as possible [metamelomai] is the exact equivalent of the word Repent or Repentance.\\"Butler, J. Glentworth. Topical Analysis of the Bible (Butler Bible Work Co, 1897), 443. Available in Google Books. Biblical scholar A. T. Robertson observes that Judas had only sorrow and regret and \\"mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life [metanoia].\\" The noun metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±, is translated \\"repentance,\\" and its cognate verb metanoe≈ç/ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ≠œâ is translated \\"repent\\" in twenty two instances in the King James Version of the New Testament. Abid Rogers Bhatti in his book A Textbook of Soteriology writes about the meaning of metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±. In the Urdu Bible, the word for ‚Äúrepentance‚Äù is ‚Äútoba.‚Äù Toba means regret, grief, and sorrow over sinful deeds that lead to a change of mind and life. Abid agrees with TertullianEdward J Anton, Repentance: A Cosmic Shift of Mind and Heart (Discipleship Publications, 2005) 32-33. in preferring ‚Äúconversion‚Äù rather than ‚Äúrepentance‚Äù to translate metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± in Mark 1:4. In summary, Abid believes that ‚Äúconversion‚Äù (rather than ‚Äúrepentance‚Äù) is the best English word to express the meaning of the Greek metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±. Use in early Christianity The term \\"...was used consistently in the literature of that time to express a fundamental change in thinking that leads to a fundamental change in behavior and/or way of living\\".Nave, Guy. The Role and function of Repentance in Luke-Acts, Society of Biblical Literature, 2002 In 2006, an ecumenical group of scholars published a study of repentance in the Bible and the Church. After \\"a thorough examination of Hellenistic Jewish writings,\\" the study found that for Jews living at the time of Jesus, \\"repentance\\" meant \\"a fundamental change in thinking and living.\\" For the New Testament, this change is a necessary ingredient in accomplishing God's plan for salvation and community for everyone.Mark J. Boda and Gordon T. Smith, eds., Repentance in Christian Theology (Michael Glazier, 2006), 90, 95. The Acts of Peter ties metanoia to the cross on which Peter was crucified. While Peter was being crucified, he explained parts of the cross from which he was hanging, including ‚Äúthe nail which holds the cross beam to the upright in the middle.‚Äù This nail is ‚Äúthe conversion [epistrophƒì] and repentance [metanoia] of man.‚ÄùJ.

According to Robert N. Wilkin, \\"The Latin Fathers translated metanoia as paenitentia, which came to mean \\"penance\\" or \\"acts of penance.\\"\\" Tertullian protested the unsuitable translation of the Greek metanoeo into the Latin paenitentiam ago by arguing that \\"in Greek, metanoia is not a confession of sins but a change of mind.\\" \\"Conversion\\" (from the Latin conversi≈çn-em turning round) with its \\"change in character\\" meaning is more nearly the equivalent of metanoia than repentance. Meaning The Merriam-Webster Dictionary transliterates the Greek ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± into metanoia and borrowing it as an English word with a definition that matches the Greek: \\"a transformative change of heart; especially: a spiritual conversion,\\" augmented by an explanation of metanoia's Greek source: \\"from metanoiein to change one's mind, repent, from meta- + noein to think, from nous mind.\\" Synonyms for \\"conversion\\" include \\"change of heart\\" and \\"metanoia.\\" In opposition to the Church's interpretation of metanoia as comprising contrition, confession, and penances, Martin Luther objected that it retained its classical sense of \\"a change of mind.\\"Luther's Works, Vol. 48, Letters (May 30, 1518 Letter to John von Staupitz), 65-70. For John Staupitz, \\"...metanoia can be derived, though not without violence, not only from post and mentem, but also from trans and mentem, so that metanoia signifies a changing of the mind and heart, because it seemed to indicate not only a change of the heart, but also a manner of changing it, i.e., the grace of God.\\".\\"Letter of John Staupitz Accompanying the \\"Resolutions\\" to the XCV Theses by Dr. Martin Luther, 1518\\", Works of Martin Luther, (Adolph Spaeth, L.D. Reed, Henry Eyster Jacobs, et Al., Trans. & Eds.), (Philadelphia: A. J. Holman Company, 1915), Volume 1, pp. 39-43 Metanoia is a concept of fundamental character for Luther, as it marks the ground of the first of his 95 thesis. John Calvin pointed to the double derivation of the Hebrew and Greek words for \\"repentance\\": the Hebrew derives from conversion, or turning again, and the Greek means a change of mind and purpose. The meaning of the word, for Calvin, is appropriate to both derivations because repentance (a) involves \\"withdrawing from ourselves,\\" (b) turning to God, (c) \\"laying aside the old,\\" and (d) putting on \\"a new mind.\\"John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion 3. 3. 1-16. Gregory Martin, the translator of the Douay-Rheims, argued in chapter 13 of his work \\"A Discovery of the Manifold Corruptions of Scripture\\" for the translation of \\"penance.\\" He based his conclusions on the writings of the church fathers and the awkward sentences that other readings lead to.\\" Gregory Martin, \\"A Discovery of the Manifold Corruptions of Scripture\\" Other interpretations The Greek Orthodox Church in America teaches that \\"The Greek term for repentance, metanoia, denotes a change of mind, a reorientation, a fundamental transformation of outlook, of man's vision of the world and of himself, and a new way of loving others and God. In the words of a second-century text, The Shepherd of Hermas, it implies \\"great understanding,\\" or discernment.\\"\\"Repentance and Confession\\", The Greek Orthodox Church in America In his 1881 The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia, Treadwell Walden, Episcopal priest and sometime rector of St. Paul's Church, Boston, designated cathedral of the diocese in 1912, asserts that metanoia conveys the essence of the Christian gospel. Walden holds that the meaning of the Greek metanoia is very different from the meaning of the English \\"repentance\\". He describes the translation of metanoia as repentance as \\"an extraordinary mistranslation.\\" Walden believed the meaning of metanoia as a \\"transmutation\\" of consciousness contrasted with classical Greek which he viewed as expressing a superficial change of mind.Treadwell Walden, The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New, p.24, (Thomas Whittaker, 1896) Walden sought to promote the proper meaning of metanoia as \\"change of Mind, a change in the trend and action of the whole inner nature, intellectual, affectional and moral\\" over against its translation as repentance.Treadwell Walden, The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New. (Thomas Whittaker, 1896), 1, 3-4, 8-9. Available online in Google Books. In Repentance: A Cosmic Shift of Mind and Heart, Edward J.Anton observes that in most dictionaries and in the minds of most Christians the primary meaning of \\"repent\\" is to look back on past behavior with sorrow, self-reproach, or contrition, sometimes with an amendment of life. But neither Jesus nor John the Baptist says to look back in sorrow. For St Paul, \\"metanoia is a transfiguration for your brain\\" that opens a new future.Anton, Edward J. Repentance: A Cosmic Shift of Mind and Heart (Discipleship Publications, 2005) 31-32. It was in its use in the New Testament and in writings grounded in the New Testament that the depth of metanoia increased until, in the words of Archbishop Richard C. Trench, it came \\"to express that mighty change in mind, heart, and life wrought by the Spirit of God.\\"Richard C. Trench, Synonyms of the New Testament (Macmillan, 1880, 9th edition) 255-261. Available online in Google Books. Scholar J. Glentworth Butler says that, in the Greek, there is none of the sorrow or regret contained in the words repentance and repent. Repentance denotes \\"sorrow for what one has done or omitted to do; especially, contrition for sin.\\" Repent primarily means \\"to review one's actions and feel contrition or regret for something one has done or omitted to do\\" Therefore, Butler asserts that translating metanoe≈ç/ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒ≠œâ and metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± as repent and repentance constitute \\"an utter mistranslation\\" that translators excuse by the fact that no English word can adequately convey the meaning of the Greek words. A. T. Robertson concurs with Butler. Regarding the translation of metanoia as repentance, Robertson calls it \\"a linguistic and theological tragedy.\\" Regarding John the Baptist's call to \\"repent\\" as a translation of the Greek metanoeite, Robertson quotes Broadus as saying that this is \\"the worst translation in the New Testament.\\" Repent means \\"to be sorry,\\" but John's call was not to be sorry, but to change mental attitudes [metanoeite] and conduct. Robertson lamented the fact that in his time there was no English word that signified the meaning of the Greek ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± (metanoia). Aloys H. Dirksen in his The New Testament Concept of Metanoia argues against metanoia as merely ‚Äúrepentance‚Äù and for metanoia as ‚Äúconversion.‚ÄùD. Tarrant, review of The New Testament Concept of Metanoia (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America, 1932.) in Classical Review 47:4 (1933). Other have characterized the translation of metanoia/ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± as \\"repentance\\" with similar negativity. Repentance is an \\"unsuitable\\" translation.Herbert George Marsh, The Origin and Significance of the New Testament Baptism (Manchester University Press, 1941), 43. It is \\"totally inadequate\\" to carry the meaning of metanoia.James Hastings and others, Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics: Vol 10 (Scribner's, 1919), s.v. \\"Repentance,\\" 733. Of the top-ten versions of the Bible in the United States based on unit sales, seven read \\"baptism of repentance\\" in Mark 1:4 in which \\"repentance\\" translates metanoia. Three of the ten top-selling versions and another in the top-ten based on dollar sales attempt to capture the meaning of metanoia. None of them transliterate the Greek ŒºŒµœÑ·ºÄŒΩŒøŒπŒ± as metanoia. * New Living Translation: \\"baptized to show that they had turned from their sins and turned to God\\" * Common English Bible: \\"baptized to show that they were changing their hearts and lives\\" * New International Readers Version: \\"baptized and turn away from their sins\\" * The Message: \\"a baptism of life-change\\" In spite of these efforts, Robert N. Wilkin forecasts that \\"repentance\\" as a translation for metanoia will likely continue in most English translations. He, therefore, advises readers to substitute \\"change of mind\\" for the words repentance and repent. In its Confirmation exegesis, the Minnehaha United Methodist Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota notes, > Metanoia is used to refer to the change of mind which is brought about in > repentance. Repentance is necessary and valuable because it brings about > change of mind or metanoia. This change of mind will make the changed person > hate sin and love God. The two terms (repentance and metanoia) are often > used interchangeably. \\"Meta-\\" is additionally used to imply \\"beyond\\" and > \\"outside of.\\" E.g., ...metaphysics as outside the limits of physics.

Yet repent carries with it a negative tone, almost an inhibition > caused by guilt; metanoia forces a positive, proactive life-affirming > response. When Jesus calls people to \\"repent,\\" to \\"metanoia,\\" could it be > that he means: \\"Change your thought processes and go beyond your mind's > present state of limitations\\"? Does this not mandate self-assessment and > interpersonal acceptance?\\"Confirmation 101\\", Minnehaha United Methodist > Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota Charles Taylor defines metanoia as \\"to change one's mind of attitude\\" and builds his pastoral counseling method on the \\"metanoia model.\\" In doing so, Taylor recalls that the center of Jesus' ministry was a call to metanoia.Charles Taylor The Skilled Pastor (Augsburg Fortress, 1991), 8, 64. For Milton Crum, metanoia means \\"a change of perception with its behavioral fruit.\\" Thus, metanoia constitutes the central thing that needs to happen in preaching.Milton Crum, Manual on Preaching (Judson, 1977 and Morehouse, 1988) 101 Peter Senge observes that what happens in a \\"learning organization\\" that experiences the \\"deeper meaning of 'learning'\\" is \\"metanoia\\" which means \\"a shift of mind.\\" Therefore, concludes Senge, \\"to grasp the meaning of 'metanoia' is to grasp the deeper meaning of 'learning.'\\"Peter M. Senge, The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization (Doubleday, 2006), 13. Also Peter M. Senge, \\"Metanoia‚ÄîA Shift of Mind\\" in The Jossey-Bass Reader on Educational Leadership (Jossey-Bass, 2nd ed, 2006) Ulrich Wilckens finds in Peter's sermon in Acts 2:38-40 as narrated by Luke the Evangelist, six steps that are required for a person's salvation. Metanoia is step number one and is essential because the other steps are contingent on a person's experiencing metanoia. Wilckens believes that this is the normative way to salvation in Luke's theology.Fran√ßois Bovon, Luke the Theologian: fifty-five years of research, 1950-2005 (Baylor University, 2006), 314.

Developments William James used the term metanoia to refer to a fundamental and stable change in an individual's life-orientation. Carl Gustav Jung developed the usage to indicate a spontaneous attempt of the psyche to heal itself of unbearable conflict by melting down and then being reborn in a more adaptive form ‚Äì a form of self healing often associated with the mid-life crisis and psychotic breakdown, which can be viewed as a potentially productive process.R. Arp. 1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think (2013) p. 255 Jung considered that psychotic episodes in particular could be understood as an existential crisis which might be an attempt at self-reparation: in such instances metanoia could represent a shift in the balance of the personality away from the persona towards the shadow and the self.Petrushka Clarkson, On Psychotherapy (1993) p. 56 Jung's concept of metanoia was an influence on R.D. Laing and his emphasis on the dissolution and replacement of everyday ego consciousness.D. A. Leeming et al, Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion (2010) p. 511 Laing's colleague, David Cooper, considered that \\"metanoia means change from the depths of oneself upwards into the superficies of one's social appearance\\" ‚Äì a process that in the second of its three stages \\"generates the 'signs' of depression and mourning\\".David Cooper, The Death of the Family (1974) p. 13-4 Similarly influenced was the therapeutic community movement. Ideally, it aimed to support people whilst they broke down and went through spontaneous healing, rather than thwarting such efforts at self-repair by strengthening a person's existing character defences and thereby maintaining the underlying conflict. The Dutch psychiatrist Jan Foudraine wrote extensively about it, tracing its history through the work of Jung and Laing, and eventually considering it ‚Äúa permanent change in gestalt.‚Äù He cites an example where one sees a black vase, then one blinks, and instead one sees two white faces in profile opposite each other (the Rubin vase).Jan Foudraine, Metanoia (2004) p. 94 In transactional analysis, metanoia is used to describe the experience of abandoning an old scripted self or false self for a more open one: a process which may be marked by a mixture of intensity, despair, self-surrender, and an encounter with the inner void.Petrushka Clarkson, On Psychotherapy (1993) p. 63-4 See alsoReferencesFurther reading * James, William, (1890), The Principles of Psychology, (New York) * Jung, Carl, (1960), The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche, CW 8.

His true ancestral name, Weiss, was changed to Albinus in the 16th century, after the fashion of the time, changed by his ancestor Petrus Weiss, poet and historian. In his youth, he coupled a weak body to a strong mind, which was the reason that his father first let him be educated at home by a capable teacher, and only after he had strengthened, was sent to the public school of his city. When the scientist Hendrik Alers, head of the school, was called to the famous school of Bremen in 1669, Albinus joined him. He studied with unusual vigour sciences and languages, especially physics and philosophy. From Bremen he went to the University of Leiden, where he studies medicine under Carolus Drelincourt, Lucas Schacht and Theodorus Cranen. In 1676 he returned to Dessau, and subsequently traveled through the Netherlands, Brabant and France, where he collected a vast amount of knowledge of medicine, anatomy and surgery. He returned to Dessau in the summer of 1680, passing through Lorraine, following the Rhine, and through Holland. That same year he was promoted to professor in medicine at the University of Frankfurt on the Oder, where he started working on 13 January 1681, even though he only became a Doctor on 16 April of the following year. Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg appointed him as his personal physician and geheimrat, which he stayed both until the death of the King on 26 April 1688, after which he returned to Frankfort as a professor. Six years later, the government of the University of Groningen offered him the function of Provincial Doctor and professor of medicine, with a salary of 1200 Dutch guilder. Even though he was pleased with the offer, he was prevented from accepted it because of the promises and gifts from Frederick I of Prussia, son and successor of Frederick William I, who increased his yearly income with 600 guilder and in 1697 not only appointed him as his personal physician but also offered him a canonry in Magdeburg, an honorary title which he sold with the approval of the king, because he couldn't fulfill it in person. After Albinus had been the personal physician of Frederick I for five years, the governors of the University of Leiden offered him in 1702 the function of professor of theoretical and practical medicine with positive and honourable conditions, which he accepted with the consent of the king. After the king had given him a valuable golden medal with his effigy, he left with his family to Holland, followed by a large number of German students. With a speech on the origin and progress of medicine, he accepted the position on 19 October of said year, which he filled studiously and faithfully, to the glory of the university, until his death on 7 September 1721. In 1696 he married Susanna Catharina Rings, daughter of Thomas Siegfried Rings, professor of law in Frankfurt, with whom he had eleven children, four sons and seven daughters. Of those, one son became a professor in Leiden, Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, and one a professor in Utrecht, all with great fame. His epitaph was written by Herman Boerhaave and published as H. Boerhaavii Oratio Academica de vita et obitu B. Albini.

She began her career as a soprano when she was only 13, but later retrained her voice as a mezzo- soprano. She sang in several world premieres, but is most remembered today for having created the role of Mistress Quickly in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff. The composer wrote the role specifically for her and dedicated the Act II aria \\"Giunta all' albergo\\" to Pasqua. She was married to the baritone Astorre Giacomelli.Her name is listed in some sources as Giuseppina Pasqua-Giacomelli Biography Giuseppina Pasqua (left) in a 1899 group photo with (among others) Teresa Stolz, Giuseppe Verdi and Leopoldo Mugnone in Montecatini Terme. Giuseppina Pasqua was born in Perugia to a prosperous family. She studied at the music conservatory in Perugia under Ulisse Corticelli and made her professional opera debut at the city's Teatro Morlacchi in 1868 singing the coloratura soprano role of Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. After further study with Marietta Piccolomini, she made her house debut at the Teatro Bellini in Palermo as Marguerite de Valois in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. She was still singing soprano roles when she made her La Scala debut on 1 September 1872 as √Ñnnchen in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz.Vetro She then studied with Luigia Abbadia in Milan to retrain her voice as a mezzo-soprano. In 1876 she sang Preziosilla in the first performance of Verdi's La forza del destino at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. The following year she had a huge success as Amneris in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna's first performance of Verdi's Aida, a role which she would repeat with similar success as La Scala 1878. As a mezzo-soprano she sang leading roles throughout Italy and the rest of Europe. She was a guest artist at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1878-1879, and in 1879 she sang Leonor de Guzm√°n in La favorita at both the Royal Opera House in London and the Bavarian State Opera. She was also very popular in Spain and Portugal where she sang many times.

Rather, the Ramayana is the story of Natural Law and how it unfolds in every individual and the universe. In 2012, Nader was the keynote speaker on a tour of 10 cities in North American, entitled \\"A New Paradigm: Veda, Consciousness, the Ramayana, and the Self\\". His presentation in Chicago to 650 Indian Americans received a standing ovation. During the tour, Nader gave presentations on ‚ÄúEmbodying Totality‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntroductory Seminar on the Ramayan in Human Physiology\\". Nader in his book, Human Physiology-expression of Veda and the Vedic Literature, postulated that the physical and material are aspects of Consciousness rather than Consciousness being an epiphenomenon of physical matter or a product of the brain and the nervous system. During his 2014 course, Hacking Consciousness, at Stanford University, he presented its mathematical framework. Subsequently, he describes with further mathematical detail his postulate that multiplicity including all matter arises from a primordial singularity of Consciousness through the spontaneous phenomenon of Consciousness actually exercising its basic nature of being conscious and thus knowing itself.

While the field is mostly contained within political science and public policy programs, it is increasingly common to take an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates knowledge from the fields of history, geography (stressing classical geopolitics), military sciences, and criminology. While the field (much like its parent field of international relations) is often meant to educate students who aspire to professional careers in think tanks, consulting, defense contractors, Human Rights NGOs or in government service positions focused on diplomacy, foreign policy, conflict resolution and prevention, emergency and disaster management, intelligence, and defense, it can also be tailored to students seeking to professionally conduct academic research within academia, or as public intellectuals, pundits or journalists writing about security policy. At its core, international security studies, as an area of inquiry, takes organized violence as its focus, and the steps individuals and aggregations of individuals can take to both employ organized violence effectively and, much more importantly, to protect themselves from organized violence (accumulation of knowledge in the former being essential for the accumulation of knowledge in the latter). Thus subjects can range from the micro‚Äîweapons types, effectiveness, tactics, human-weapons interfaces, individual and group motivations‚Äîto the macro; including the causes of war, nuclear strategy, military doctrine, defense spending, and conventional and unconventional warfare strategies. More recently, however, these traditional approaches to security have been supplemented (one leaves the utility open to argument) by variants such as critical security studies, the Copenhagen School, and Feminist security studies. Clearly useful contributions to our understanding of insecurity and security have also come from constructivism (international relations), peace studies and critical theory. As implied by the close association of the Cold War with the advent and establishment of international security studies as such, broader historical trends (or rather perceptions of them) created the openings that these alternative schools have sought, with mixed effect, to provide an array of theoretical foundations. Contemporary security studies is therefore as contested a field of inquiry as it is both interesting and important.Williams, Paul (2012) Security Studies: An Introduction, Abingdon: Routledge See also * Environmental security * Feminist security studies * Human security * International Relations theory * National Defense University, College of International Security Affairs * Peace and conflict studies * The Institute of World Politics * Welsh School (security studies) Journals * Armed Forces & Society * Defense Studies * European Security * European Journal of International Security * Georgetown Security Studies Review * Intelligence and National Security * International Journal of Conflict and Violence * International Security * Journal of Conflict Resolution * Journal of Global Security Studies * Journal of Strategic Studies * Security Dialogue * Security Studies * Studies in Conflict and Terrorism * Terrorism and Political Violence * Texas National Security Review  Some universities with academic programs in security studies * Arizona State University, M.A. in Global Security * Australian National University, Bachelor of International Security Studies * Babes-Bolyai University, MA in International Relations, Security Studies and Crisis Management * Brunel University, MA in Intelligence and Security Studieshttps://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/Intelligence-and-Security- Studies-MA * Charles University in Prague, Master in International Security Studies * Coastal Carolina University, Bachelor of Intelligence and National Security Studies *Copenhagen University, MsC Security Risk Management http://www.coastal.edu/politics/programs/intelligenceandnationalsecuritystudiesba/ * East Carolina University, M.A. in Security Studies; Security Studies Certificate * University of Huddersfield, M.Sc. in Criminology and Global Security * George Mason University, M.A. in International Securityhttps://schar.gmu.edu/prospective-students/programs/masters- programs/international-security-ma * George Washington University, M.A. in Security Policy Studies * Georgetown University, M.A. in Security Studies, Ph.D. in Government with Security Studies concentration * Johns Hopkins University, M.A. in Global Security Studies * Kansas State University, Ph.D. in Security Studies *King's College London, B.A. in War Studies, MA in War Studies, and PhD in War Studies * Metropolitan university Prague, Bachelor of International relations and European studies * Macquarie University, Bachelor of Security Studies * Masaryk University, Bachelor and Master of Security and Strategic Studies * Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT), M.S.

He was born in Brihuega, Guadalajara, Spain, and was taught by his brother Diego Dur√≥n, also a composer. Sebastian served as organist and choirmaster at various cathedrals (Seville, Cuenca, El Burgo de Osma, Plasencia) until in 1691 he was appointed master of the Royal Chapel of King Charles II in Madrid. He remained in this position until 1706, when he was suspended because of expressing support for Archduke Charles of Austria during the War of Spanish Succession, which ended with the victory of Bourbon King Philip V. Dur√≥n was forced into exile in France, from where he returned briefly in 1714 to serve as a musician to the Dukes of Osuna. In 1715 he returned permanently to Bayonne, France as chaplain to the exiled queen Mariana of Neuburg, the widow of Charles II, to whom he officiated in her scandalous remarriage to the son of a barrel-maker. He died in 1716 of tuberculosis at Cambo-les-Bains, Aquitaine, France. Although Dur√≥n composed many sacred pieces, and these and his villancicos were taken to the New World,Stevenson R.M.

The glacier is located in the Chandra Valley of Lahaul. The glacier feeds the Chenab River. The name comes from the Lahaul dialect, where Bara means big and Shigri means glacier. According to Hugh Whistler's 1924 writing, \\"Shigri is applied par- excellence to one particular glacier that emerges from the mountains on the left bank of the Chenab. It is said to be several miles long, and the snout reaches right down to the river, lying athwart the customary road from Kullu to Spiti.\\" Estimates differ as to the breadth of the glacier where it is crossed, as owing to its movement and roughness no two caravans cross it in exactly the same way, but it is not less than a mile wide. In 1836 this glacier dammed the Chenab River, causing the formation of a large lake, which eventually broke loose and carried devastation down the valley. The Bara Shigri glacier attracted much attention for many years because of the valuable antimony deposits found there. The glacier was first surveyed in 1906 by H. Walker and E.H. Pascoe of the Geological Survey of India. In 1955, the Geological Survey of India sponsored an expedition to this glacier as part of the Indian programme for the International Geophysical Year 1956‚Äì57, when a number of Himalayan glaciers were examined and their snout position fixed. The Bara Shigri glacier flows northwards and debouches into the Chenab River where its southerly course is deflected westwards, close to the Spiti border. The glacier's altitude is between and , and its length has been recently surveyed and mapped. The glacier is so heavily covered with surface moraine that ice is not visible for long stretches except along the crevices and in the ablation areas. Across the Bara Shigri is another glacier known as Chhota Shigri.

It also financed expansion of city's infrastructure and creation of modern sewer system. It was formed in 1685, but it was not until 1740 that it actually started to function. The Polish parliament disbanded it in 1791 and passed its duties to the newly created Commission of Police and Good Order. The Commission was one of the first bodies functioning in all parts of Warsaw, both the royal towns of Warsaw Old Town, Warsaw New Town, Praga and the jurydyka-type settlements, normally exempted from the city's laws. The Commission, officially styled the Cobblestone Commission of His Majesty the King and the Republic was initially created in 1685. At that time most of the city streets were unpaved and muddy. The city's infrastructure and sewers were also in a tragic condition. Headed by the Grand Marshal of the Court, the Commission was tasked with paving the streets, creating sewers and wells, draining the swampy areas of Powi≈õle, building bridges and organising the daily functioning of municipal services. Its services were financed by both the state treasury and the burghers taxed with the so-called Cobblestone Tax, depending on the width of their building's fa√ßade (measured in Polish ells of ca. 79 centimetres). Until 1693 the Commission existed mostly on paper. After that it hired a renowned architect Tylman van Gameren to build numerous municipal buildings. However, its main task remained unfulfilled. Despite initial successes, soon after its creation the Commission practically ceased to exist. It was not until 1740 that it was reformed by Franciszek Bieli≈Ñski. Under his leadership in less than 20 years it managed to pave 222 roads, the vast majority of streets in Warsaw at the time. The Commission also created infrastructure for city's expansion in late 18th and early 19th centuries. It created permanent market squares to empty the city streets of stalls, meliorated numerous swampy areas, and closed all breweries, pottery manufactures and distilleries functioning within densely built-up areas to limit the risk of fires. In 1768 the commission also hired five \\"Night Wardens\\", the predecessor of what later became the Warsaw Fire Brigade. The Commission also issued numerous decrees, some of them later incorporated into modern Polish law. Among such decrees was a ban on dumping trash on the streets.

It got its name from its maker Vernon Gash who was based in Leeds, Yorkshire. The car seems to have been better engineered than most cyclecars with a tubular metal frame. The 8 hp V-twin JAP engine was air-cooled and had a conventional 3-speed transmission. This was connected to the worm gear final drive by a transmission shaft. The open bodywork had a single bench seat that was claimed to be wide enough for three people. The selling price was 110 guineas (¬£115.50). A promised Sports model was probably never produced.

They provide farmers with the support across the entire value chain, from supplying seedlings and other planting inputs to establish tree farms, up to harvesting, processing and selling mature trees to local markets. Komaza has planted nearly 7,000 tree farms and currently employs over 100 full-time staff. With headquarters in Kilifi town, the company works with thousands of farmers throughout Kilifi County, and is actively expanding into Kwale County. The company has planted over 2 million trees with over 6,000 farmers in Kenya. Komaza has goals to plant 1 billion trees with 1 million farmers across 10+ countries by 2030.  History  Komaza was founded in 2006 by Tevis Howard. Prior to starting Komaza, Howard had been pursuing a career in science from an early age. His high school science project on multiple sclerosis won Third Place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, culminating in being named on the Forbes ASAP list of \\"Top-10 Teenage All Stars.\\" Howard then spent a gap year in Kenya, conducting malaria research at the KEMRI- Wellcome Trust Research Labs, a prominent medical research facility in Kilifi, Kenya. Howard then began his studies at Brown University, where we graduated with a degree in Neuroscience in 2007. Howard started Komaza from his dorm room in 2005 while in his third year at college. Motivated by a desire to get rural dryland farmers out of poverty, he researched and developed several preliminary business plans, with trees emerging as the winner. Komaza started by planting a 5-acre demonstration tree farm on the Mombasa-Malindi highway on the outskirts of Kilifi town. After graduating university, Howard immediately returned to Kenya, hired an early team, and began planting with the first farmers in 2008. In that year, Howard was awarded fellowships from the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation and the Mulago Foundation, two highly-selective social enterprise foundations in California. Howard has since won several awards for his work with Komaza, including the Social Venture Network's Innovation Award in 2010, an Ashoka Fellowship in 2011, and being named on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2014. Howard has dedicated more than a decade to growing the organization to the point of planting 2,000 hectares over this time.  Micro-Forestry  Komaza‚Äôs model is a combination of microfinance and sustainable forestry. Working through a village-based farmer extension network, Komaza identifies interested farmer groups under the advice and consent of community leadership and then provides them with appropriate agriculture inputs and tools on credit ‚Äì such as improved seeds and fertilizer, on-farm training and support, and complete vertically integrated value chain services so that they can access markets and transform their previously unproductive land into valuable tree farms. Farmers can then reinvest this profit to start their own business, pay school fees for their children and receive improved healthcare. Komaza supports farmers through a \\"Field Extension Network\\" of full-time field staff. Facilitators work in their villages to support farmers in their community. They are supervised by Field Officers who supervise hundreds of farmers in a location. Finally Field Managers provide training and management support.  Accomplishments  As of 2016, Komaza had partnered with nearly 7,000 farm families to plant more than 2,000,000 trees in Kenya‚Äôs Kilifi County.

Sinologist, translator of Chinese literature  Woesler translated works from the Chinese authors L«î X√πn È≠ØËøÖ, Zh≈çu Zu√≤r√©n Âë®‰Ωú‰∫∫, X«î D√¨shƒÅn Ë®±Âú∞Â±±, Y√π D√°f≈´ ÈÉÅÈÅîÂ§´, Zh≈´ Z√¨qƒ´ng Êú±Ëá™Ê∏Ö, Bƒ´ng Xƒ´n ÂÜ∞ÂøÉ, BƒÅ Jƒ´n Â∑¥Èáë, Qi√°n Zh≈çngsh≈´ Èå¢ÈçæÊõ∏, W√°ng Mƒõng ÁéãËíô, ZhƒÅng Ji√© ÂºµÊ¥Å, Li√∫ Z√†if√π ÂäâÂÜçÂæ©, Ji«é P√≠ngwƒÅ Ë≥àÂπ≥Âáπ, and H√°n H√°n ÈüìÂØí into English and German as well as of C√°o Xuƒõq√≠n ÊõπÈõ™Ëäπ into German. Together with Rainer Schwarz he published the first complete translation of the Chinese novel The Dream of the Red Chamber into German. Woesler made available a lot of Chinese literature for the first time in a Western language. In China, Woesler documented a critical campaign against the liberal Minister of Culture W√°ng Mƒõng ÁéãËíô and proved that this campaign was only superficially motivated by an interest in literature, whereas the actual motivation was political (Political literature in China 1991-1992, 1994). He turned the until then neglected genre of the Chinese essay into a modern tool to express the upcoming individualism in China before the eyes of the European and American China Studies (History of the Chinese essay, 3 vols., 1998). These short first-person narratives, which mostly appeared in newspapers between the May-4th-movement 1919 and the beginning of the 1930s, were a new form for the awaking civil society to express its views and feelings. From the 1930s until around 1979, the essay faced an ideological instrumentalization at the expense of its literary quality. Woesler drew attention to the essayistic work of Zh≈çu Zu√≤r√©n, the younger brother of Lu Xun, who was ostracized due to his positive attitude towards Japan and his independence from daily politics and propaganda. Woesler's re-evaluation of Zhou's work were confirmed by different scholars outside mainland China. In fact, Zhou's writing of intentionally unpolitical literature in a time when literature was instrumenalized, was a political statement by itself. Woeslers work in the tensional field between politics and literature stimulated further books on Zhou, mostly from North American sinologists, supporting the necessity to re-evaluate Zhou. Since the 1980s, China sees the upcoming of a critical public again. Woesler sees here a parallel between the role of the internet since the 1990s and the newspapers between the 1910s and 1930s. In his books (China's digital dream 2002, and others), together with Chinese scholars, he came to the conclusion, that the internet in China has a more liberalizing impact on society than it has in more liberal countries.  Categorization and description of trends of contemporary Chinese literature  In preparation of the Frankfurt Book Fair 2009, when China was the guest of honor, Woesler categorized contemporary Chinese literature. He himself translated two very different novels for the Book Fair: The most uncontentious canonized classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin, which has never been fully translated into German before, and one of the most contentious books of China today, Panda Sex by Mian Mian. As the main trend of Chinese literature, Woesler sees young authors describing their everyday life in a rapidly and excitingly changing reality. The main motivation force of this literature is the alienation, initiated by urbanization and loss of orientation. Young Chinese do not live in and for the traditional family clan anymore, but are on their own. This has added a more critical and independent view to Chinese literature. The stories are dealing with drugs abuse, alienation, singles and the world of dreams. This touches also Western readers of translations. After the liberal 1980s, the 1990s saw a strong commerzialization of literature due to an opening of the book market. Woesler sees the following trends: 'cult literature' such as Guo Jingming's Cry Me a River ÊÇ≤‰º§ÈÄÜÊµÅÊàêÊ≤≥; vagabond literature such as Xu Zechen's Running Through Beijing Ë∑ëÊ≠•Á©øËøá‰∏≠ÂÖ≥Êùë and Liu Zhenyun's The Pickpockets ÊàëÂè´ÂàòË∑É; underground literature such as Mian Mian's Panda Sex Â£∞ÂêçÁãºÁ±ç; 'longing for something' literature, divided in historicizing literature such as Yu Dan's Confucius in Your Heart „ÄäË´ñË™û„ÄãÂøÉÂæó and Yi Zhongtian's Chinese History Êòì‰∏≠Â§©‰∏≠ËèØÂè≤; Tibetan literature with Alai; literature of the mega cities; women's literature with Bi Shumin; and master narratives by narrators like Mo Yan's Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out.Martin Woesler, 'Chinese contemporary literature - authors, works, trends ‚Äì A snap-shot 2007/2008', Munich 2008, 267 pp. However Chinese literature at the beginning of the 21st century shows signs of overcoming the commercialization of literature of the 1980s and 1990s. An example is Han Han's novel His Land ‰ªñÁöÑÂõΩ, which was written in a social critical surrealistic style against the uncritical mainstream, but ranked 1st in 2009 Chinese bestseller list.Martin Woesler, Chinese cultic literature 2008/2009 - authors, works, trends, Munich 2009, 127 pp. The online literature plays a more important role.

History The program's early years were from London but from August 1968 the show centred on Midlands teams. This coincided with the re-jigging of the ITV network. ATV was now a Midlands only broadcaster. The program was hosted initially by Billy Wright and then Gary Newbon, occasionally joined by a guest in the studio. The main commentator was Hugh Johns, ITV's man at the microphone for the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final. Other commentators included Peter Lorenzo, Nick Owen and Peter Brackley. Format The programme's format was typical of the time, extended highlights of a Midlands based match was the main attraction and then shorter highlights of two other games from around the country, covered by other ITV regions. Where possible this would be a game involving a Midlands team as the visiting team. The programme was broadcast during a ‚Äúglory‚Äù period for Midlands-based teams, Derby County, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa all won league championships, the latter two adding European Cups as well. Wolverhampton Wanderers also had a successful spell, bagged a brace of League Cups and competed in Europe; Stoke City also won this competition in 1972. An entertaining West Bromwich Albion side broke new boundaries by including three black players and a young Trevor Francis dazzled all before him for Birmingham City before his big money move to Forest. All this was captured by the ATV cameras, but it wasn't just about the top division. Shrewsbury Town‚Äôs promoted side were featured in Division 2 specials, and on FA Cup weekends many lower league sides were featured. By 1983 the appetite for live football was growing and the FA allowed games to be shown in a deal with the BBC and ITV. Match of the Day Live and The Big Match Live would become the banners for TV football for the rest of the decade. Both networks continued to show highlights, however, they were invariably shunted to late night slots at a weekend.

Growing up in the harsh climate of northern Norway, she was 34 when she married Hans Egede, the 21-year-old pastor of V√•gan in the Lofoten archipelago. They had four children - Poul (1709‚Äì1789), Niels (1710‚Äì1782), Kirstine Matthea (1715‚Äì1786) and Petronelle (1716‚Äì1805).Torstein J√∏rgensen, \\"Hans Egede - utdypning\\" in Store Norske Leksikon (Norwegian).

Her husband's determination to establish a Greenland mission had become firm by 1710 at the latest; Gertrud Rask Egede strongly resisted his plan initially, but eventually she bent to his will after he promised not to go to Greenland without her. Mission to Greenland In 1718, the couple and their children moved to Bergen, whence - at the conclusion of the Great Northern War - they set sail for Greenland on 12 May 1721, arriving at Baal's River (the modern Nuup Kangerlua) on the southwest coast on 3 July. Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) was established on Kangeq Island at the mouth of the fjord; the remains of the house where the family lived together with (initially) about 25 other people are still preserved. The settlement was moved to the mainland and renamed Godthaab by the royal governor Claus Paarss in 1728. Despite her strong Pietist bias, Gertrud supported her husband's missionary work among the Inuit, working among them as a nurse. In 1733, the Moravian missionaries Christian Stach, Matthias Stach, and Christian David arrived and began the settlement that would become first New Herrnhut and then Nuuk. Also with them, however, was one of Hans Egede's child converts who had been sent to Denmark to participate in the festivities around the coronation of Christian VI: the child had contracted smallpox and spread the disease to the defenseless Inuit, thousands of whom died over the next two years.Cranz, David & al.

In 1736, her husband left the island in the care of his son Poul and returned her body to Denmark for burial at the St. Nikolai Church in Copenhagen (now Kunsthallen Nikolaj) where Egede himself was buried upon his death in 1758. Legacy Roads in both Greenland and Denmark, a church in Qaqortoq (then known as Julianeh√•b), a children's home and a restaurant in Nuuk have all been named after Gertrud Rask. An icebreaking steamship, the Gertrude Rask, was launched in Nakskov, Denmark in 1923.

Many skilled soldiers were sent into the Void, all of them meeting their ends. Until finally, the military sent in experts: A soldier named Rusty, who was actually born in the Void, and Nikola Tesla. Once there, they began to charge through the Watchers' forces, stealing the portal control codes from two bases set up in the void, until finally moving onto a third facility, where the main portal was kept, and where the final code was also guarded, more closely than the previous two. There, Rusty and Tesla would finally attempt to shut down the portal and save mankind. Development Capcom-Unity manager Seth Killian stated that Dark Void Zero started as a joke after he had heard an 8-bit rendition of Dark Voids main theme in its end credits. This song, along with the soundtrack of Dark Void Zero, was produced by Battlestar Galactica composer Bear McCreary. At the beginning of the game, players must blow into the Nintendo DSi's microphone to clear the dust off of an in-game cartridge, similar to how NES cartridges would have to be blown into at times. Talk show host Jimmy Fallon lent his name in the game based on a fictional story where Fallon won a contest from Capcom during his younger years. He was included in it as \\"Captain Jimmy Fallon\\". Fictional development The fictional story of the development of Dark Void Zero is given in the official trailer as: > In the year 198X, the PlayChoice-10 was the first arcade cabinet to feature > two interactive screens. Capcom soon began developing a game to make use of > this advanced technology. This ground breaking title was called: Dark Void. > Unfortunately, the PlayChoice-10 was discontinued and the project was > cancelled. In the year 20XX, Capcom found the project buried deep inside its > vault. Its concept inspired a new adventure of the same name. But... the > original game... locked away for decades... is now back from the void... However, this story contradicts the one given in the DSiWare Shop summary, which states that Dark Void Zero was a \\"legendary 'lost project'\\" at Capcom, recreated for the DSi, rather than being forgotten until 2010 and being a port of the original. Reception The DS and iOS versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PC version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While 2D-X Editor-in- Chief Jeffrey L. Wilson initially criticized Dark Void Zero as being exploitative of the retro gaming genre, he later retracted his statement after playing it at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), commenting that it felt like a NES-era title. GamePro editor Dave Rudden called it one of the coolest games at the CES, comparing it to the \\"Metroidvania\\" genre, which is a combination of the styles of Metroid and Castlevania, as well as video games such as Contra. Kombo editor David Oxford commented that Dark Void Zero was better than its parent video game, comparing it to Bionic Commando Rearmed in how both promotional games surpassed the games they were promoting.

In 2015, it was refurbished to carry a pedestrian and cycle path. The name is also used to refer to the road bridge that runs alongside and carries the A379 road.  History  The bridge carried the London and South Western Railway branch to Turnchapel over the River Plym in Devon. Later the Great Western Railway also had running powers over the bridge providing access to their Yealmpton branch at . The bridge was built by Messrs Relf and Pethick after being authorised by an act of parliament in 1883. It was completed by 1887, and was opened in July 1892. Passenger trains ceased to use it when the passenger services to Turnchapel and Yealmpton were terminated in the 1950s but the bridge remained in use to serve the Associated Portland Cement works. It finally closed to traffic in the 1990s.  Refurbishment as a cycle and pedestrian bridge  In 2015, the bridge was restored at a cost of ¬£3.5 million in order to turn it into a cycle and pedestrian pathway. The work was due for completion by Spring 2015. Phase 1 was completed in May 2015. The path will link into existing footpaths and cycleways including Route 27 of the National Cycle Network. The bridge will link existing off road cycle paths which join Devonport and Stonehouse in the west to Plymstock and Plympton in the east. Funding came from a number of sources including a ¬£750,000 developer contribution from the Saltram Meadow development and from the government's local sustainable transport fund.

As of the beginning of 2010, most of the existing innovative financing mechanisms were allocated for the health care sector in developing countries. Innovative financing mechanisms have already raised US$2 billion over the past 3 years. Origin The concept \\"innovative financing for development\\" was first mentioned and introduced at the International Conference on Financing for Development in 2002. The Conference led to what is now called the Monterrey Consensus where signatories acknowledged \\"‚Ä¶the value of exploring innovative sources of finance provided that those sources do not unduly burden developing countries.\\" Innovative financing mechanisms were born out of a need to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations agreed to achieve by the year 2015. They include reducing extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases such as Tuberculosis. So far, most donor states have failed to meet their 0.7% commitment from the Monterrey Consensus of their Gross National Income (GNI) dedicated to Official Development Assistance. Furthermore, in most developing countries the budget allocated for the social, and especially the Health sector, has been insufficient as it fails to meet the 15% Gross National Product (GNP) requirement dedicated to the Health Sector stated in the Abuja declaration of African leaders in 2001. Innovative financing mechanisms emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century as alternative mechanisms to help bridge the development financing gap. Principles of innovative financing mechanisms Innovative financing mechanisms can be assessed regarding the following principles: Scaling-up: Innovative financing mechanisms should significantly increase funding in order to bridge the financing gap necessary to achieve the MDGs. Additionality: Since these mechanisms were created to fill this gap, innovative financing mechanisms cannot replace Official Development Assistance nor will they be sufficient if certain countries decide to renounce the commitments that they have made. Complementarity: The role of innovative financing mechanisms is to raise new funds for existing organizations and not to add new actors and complexities to the development landscape. Sustainability: In order to have a significant and sustainable impact on the MDG's, innovative financing mechanisms should have the objective and ability to finance long-term programs in coordination with other countries. Finally, innovative financing mechanisms should be designed to comply with the other principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action. Existing innovative financing mechanisms for Health Unitaid, an international facility for the purchase of drugs against HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, is supported by a so-called \\"air ticket solidarity levy,\\" or a tax on airline tickets. As of 2009, 13 countries apply such a domestic tax on airline tickets. UNITAID funds projects through implementing partners across the three diseases based on the market impact criteria (making medication prices affordable for developing countries). The International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) issues bonds in the capital markets, converting long-term government pledges into immediately available cash resources. The pledges are used to repay IFFIm bondholders. So far, IFFIm has raised US$3.7 billion in the bonds markets backed by US$6.3 billion in government pledges. These funds are collected for the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation). Since IFFIm's founding in 2006, it has provided close to half of GAVI's overall funding. The Pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment (AMC) is a mechanism that supports the work of the GAVI Alliance by providing a financial incentive to manufacturers to invest in R&D; and expand manufacturing capacity for new vaccines. Governments or organizations commit to buy or subsidize the purchase of a certain amount of vaccines at a given price. The AMC has been implemented for pneumococcal vaccines to demonstrate both the feasibility of the AMC mechanism and its impact on accelerating the introduction and mass-production of these vaccines. As of summer 2012, the AMC had supported the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in 17 developing countries. Product RED is a mechanism supporting The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Thanks to the mechanism, global companies contribute a share of their profits on goods from sales branded with the Product Red trademark. Debt2Health is a mechanism supporting the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Through this mechanism, the Global Fund facilitates debt negotiation between creditors and debtors. Creditors agree to forgo part of the repayment of the money due to them against the commitment of the debtor to invest an agreed- upon amount on Global Fund-approved programs. So far, ‚Ç¨200 million has been pledged by the end of 2009 and ‚Ç¨50 million had been disbursed in October 2008. Voluntary Contributions on travel and tourism products funds are collected by the Millennium Foundation through a donation to MASSIVEGOOD which lets travellers make an optional $2, ¬£2 or ‚Ç¨2 \\"micro-contribution\\" every time they purchase a travel services. All funds go to UNITAID in its fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Additional funding will go towards improving maternal and child health in the developing world. De-Tax is a \\"proposal to earmark a share of VAT Taxes generated by participating businesses for health systems development\\". De-Tax is being discussed by the G20 countries. Possible promising innovative financing mechanisms for development Among some potential future innovative finance mechanisms: Currency Transaction Levy (CTL) is a potential mechanism that would let governments apply a tax on foreign exchange transactions. An expert working group is underway to assess the feasibility of the proposed levy of 0.005%. The tax would be managed through computerized payments made in connection with the settlement of every trade. Auctioning of permits to emit greenhouse gases could be one of the first innovative financing mechanisms earmarked for environmental purposes. Germany announced that it would allocate ‚Ç¨225 million from the 2009 proceeds of these auctions to fund development activities. The development process of new innovative financing mechanisms has been improved thanks to the contribution of various players. Interagency initiatives such as The High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems and The Leading Group on Innovative Financing for Development have facilitated coordination processes between actors and is also a platform for introducing new innovative financing mechanisms. LSL World Initiative is another company focusing on innovative financing. They assist governments to put in place micro-surcharges, taxes and public-private partnerships as mechanisms to raise additional funds and finance development projects. They focus specifically on the ICT and telecoms sector, harnessing diaspora flows. Another example of innovative (ocean) financing ‚Ä≥is the issuing of Blue Bonds by the Government of the Seychelles, an innovative approach to promote the African islands‚Äô Blue Economy (The Blue Economy) investment strategy.‚Ä≥ The intention of the bond is to finance and enhance the local fishery management in order to secure the marine ecosystem. > Key publications have helped shaping the Innovative Financing framework. Among these key publications are: the Landau report, the report of Working Group 2 from the Task Force for Innovative Financing in Health Systems, a report by Brookings Institution and the World Bank. Innovative Financing has received support from the United Nations through international conferences on Financing for Development and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development.

The Church has existed in or near the area now known as Bonn Square, since the twelfth centurySt Peter-le-Bailey Church, Oxford, Oxfordshire , map, ViewFinder , English Heritage, UK. The suffix \\"le-Bailey\\" was due to its position close to Oxford Castle. It also distinguished it from Oxford's other church dedicated to St Peter, namely St Peter-in-the-East, near the original east gate of the city, now the library of St Edmund Hall. Since the inception of the parish, there have been three different church buildings. The first church was built in the 12th century. It had a single, pitched-roofed nave with a low tower at the southwest corner. A second church was built on the site of the original church, opening in 1740. It was a flat roofed rectangular building with a tower at the northwest corner. The churchyard remained in its original position since there was no room to expand it. The church remained in use until the middle of the 19th century, when in 1848 Holywell Cemetery, Osney Cemetery, and St Sepulchre's Cemetery opened. In 1855, new burials were forbidden at all city churches, apart from existing vaults. This church was demolished in 1873 as part of a road widening scheme. The third church was built to the north of the old church, approximately halfway along New Inn Hall Street, to designs by Basil Champneys.St Peter-le-Bailey at www.british- history.ac.uk It was opened in 1874 and was photographed by Henry Taunt.St Peter-le-Bailey Church, Oxford, Oxfordshire , photograph by Henry Taunt, ViewFinder , English Heritage, UK.

In 1961, St Peter's Hall became a full Oxford University college. In the same year, with a decreasing number of residents in the parish, it was merged with St Ebbe's and the church building was solely used as the college chapel.

These arboreal, wasp-like ants have an orange-brown body around 3 mm in length and very large eyes. The acacia ant is best known and named for living in symbiosis with the bullhorn acacia (Acacia cornigera) throughout Central America. The ant and the acacia exemplify a coevolution of a mutualistic system, as described by evolutionary ecologist Daniel Janzen. Description \\"Horns\\" of Acacia cornigera left P. ferruginea is an obligate plant ant that occupies at least five species of acacia (A. chiapensis, A. collinsii, A. cornigera, A. hindsii and A. sphaerocephala). Its life cycle conforms to the claustral pattern of ants in general. Mutualistic symbiosis To repel herbivorous animals, various acacias protect their succulent leaves with one of several methods, including vicious-looking spines, repellent, noxious chemicals, and as in the case of the bull's horn acacia by developing a mutualism with the Acacia ant. The symbiotic relationship begins when a newly mated queen is attracted by the odour from the tree and starts nesting inside the large hollow acacia thorns. The queen nibbles into the thorn to lay 15‚Äì20 eggs to produce the first generation of workers. As the colony grows, more of the bulbous thorns get inhabited, and when the colony reaches some 400 individuals the ants start to act as gardeners. As gardeners, the ants aggressively attack creatures of all sizes attracted by the acacia leaves, killing insects such as crickets and stinging the heads of mammals such as goats. Even other plants such as epiphytic vines are repelled and as little as an unfamiliar odour can cause the ants to swarm toward the potential threat. Additionally, the ants scout the ground around the tree for seedlings and destroy any competitors they find. In compensation, special glands at the base of the tree's leaves produce a nectar rich in sugar and amino acids, and the tips of the leaves sprout Beltian bodies, small nutritious packets of oils and proteins. However, not all is mutually beneficial: the ants relish the sweet honeydew produced by scale insects which suck the sap of the acacia and therefore protect them as well, effectively providing entry to diseases. The development of myrmecophytism (\\"ant symbiosis\\") and spininess in African and New World acacia species was an adaptation to the presence of large faunas of effective browsing mammals. The ants' sting is very painful, causing a lasting burning and throbbing effect. The ants provide vital protection to the bull's-horn acacias day and night, and it has been shown(Janzen 1966, 1967, 1969) that without the ants, Acacia cornigera suffer greater damage from attacking insects and tend to be overgrown by competing plant species. Life cycle An opened A. cornigera thorn containing an adult and immature P. ferruginea. Nuptial flight occurs in warm weather at any time of the year. If an acacia thorn has not been opened by a previous occupant, the queen gnaws a circular hole to enter the thorn cavity. She lays 15 to 20 eggs, rears her first brood while remaining secluded inside the thorn. The population of the colony then increases to 150 workers within seven months, to 300 three months later, to 1,100 in two years, and to over 4,000 in three years. In young colonies workers leave the protective thorns to collect nectar and Beltian bodies, but only as long as necessary. At rare intervals they leave their thorns to occupy new ones. Males and virgin queens are produced during the second year. As the number of ants reach 50‚Äì100, workers start patrolling the open plant surface next to their home thorn, and as the population reaches 200‚Äì400 workers become more aggressive and attack other smaller nearby colonies, ward off phytophagous insects that make landing attempts near the thorn more effectively. In old colonies the queen is physogastric (i.e. a swollen, membranous abdomen), heavily attended by workers, and accompanied by hundreds of eggs and young larvae. Larvae The larvae are fed on unaltered fragments of Beltian bodies that are pushed deep into the larva's food pouch (the trophothylax, a pocket just behind the mouth). The larva then starts to rotate its head in and out of the pouch to chew the contents, while ejecting droplets of clear fluid possibly containing digestive enzyme into the pouch. Fragments that protrude from the pouch are removed by a worker and redistributed. Regularly, workers force open the pouch to regurgitate droplets of fluid into it. The nature of this fluid is uncertain. It is possible captured insects constitute a secondary source of nutrition to the larvae. Uses In traditional Maya medicine, acacia ants are used to treat depression by forcing an ant to bite a vein several times, usually in the crook of the elbow. The ants can also be crushed to form an oil which is applied to the chest to treat asthma.

In common antibodies, the antigen binding region consists of the variable domains of the heavy and light chains (VH and VL). Heavy-chain antibodies can bind antigens despite having only VH domains. This observation has led to the development of a new type of antibody fragments with potential use as drugs, so-called single-domain antibodies. Discovery In 1989 a group of biologists led by Raymond Hamers at the Free University Brussels investigated the immune system of dromedaries. In addition to the expected four-chain antibodies, they identified simpler antibodies consisting only of two heavy chains. This discovery was published in Nature in 1993. In 1995 a research team at the University of Miami found a different type of heavy-chain antibodies in sharks. In cartilaginous fishes A heavy-chain shark antibody (left) and a heavy-chain camelid antibody (middle) in comparison to a common antibody (right). Heavy chains are shown in a darker shade, light chains in a lighter shade. The immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) of cartilaginous fishes (for example sharks) is a heavy-chain antibody. IgNAR shows significant structural differences to other antibodies. It has five constant domains (CH) per chain instead of the usual three, several disulfide bonds in unusual positions, and the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) forms an extended loop covering the site which binds to a light chain in other antibodies. These differences, in combination with the phylogenetic age of the cartilaginous fishes, have led to the hypothesis that IgNAR could be more closely related to a primordial antigen-binding protein than the mammalian immunoglobulins. To test this hypothesis, it would be necessary to discover IgNAR or similar antibodies in vertebrates that are phylogenetically still older, like the jawless fish lamprey and hagfish. Non-vertebrates do not have antibodies at all. Sharks, and possibly other cartilaginous fishes, have immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin W (IgW) as well, both types with two heavy and two light chains. In camelids The only mammals with heavy-chain (IgG-like) antibodies are camelids such as dromedaries, camels, llamas and alpacas. This is a secondary development: The heavy chains of these antibodies have lost one of their constant domains (CH1) and underwent modifications in the variable domain (VH), both structural elements necessary for the binding of light chains. In one subgroup, the missing CH1 seems to be replaced by an extended hinge region, as shown in the image. Despite their different overall structure, camelid heavy-chain antibodies share several properties with IgNAR, for example the extended CDR3 loop and the conformation of the CDR1. It has been reasoned that these similarities are caused by functional requirements, or convergent evolution, rather than a genuine relationship. About 50% of the antibodies in camelids are of the ordinary mammalian heavy/light-chain type. It is not known whether any type of animal has only heavy-chain antibodies and completely lacks the common type with two heavy and two light chains. Heavy- chain camelid antibodies have been found to be just as specific as a regular antibody and in some cases they are more robust. As well, they are easily isolated using the same phage panning procedure used for traditional antibodies, allowing them to be cultured ex vivo in large concentrations. The smaller size and single domain make these antibodies easier to transform into bacterial cells for bulk production, making them ideal for research purposes.Ghannam, A., Kumari, S., Muyldermans, S., & Abbady, A.

It has a Mediterranean climate, and is in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. This ecoregion is restricted to the high mountain massifs of the regions of Basilicata, Calabria and the island of Sicily. Climate The climate of the ecoregion changes with attitude. The lower mountain slopes have a warm and sub-humid climate, with an average annual temperature of 14 to 17¬∫ C. High elevations are cooler and more humid, with annual average temperatures of 9 to 13¬∫ C and over 2000 mm of precipitation annually. The mountain summits in southern Calabria and northeastern Sicily are frequently covered in dense fog. Winters at high elevation are cold, with abundant snowfall. Flora The ecoregion's wide altitudinal range results in several forest zones. Lowest elevations At lowest elevations the forests are characterized by the sclerophyllous evergreen holm oak (Quercus ilex) and cork oak (Quercus suber), coniferous stone pine (Pinus pinea), and the decidous trees Quercus pubescens, Fraxinus ornus, and Ostrya carpinifolia. Medium elevations At medium elevations the mixed deciduous forests of Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, Quercus frainetto, sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), and Ostrya carpinifolia predominate. High elevations At high elevation altitudes there is a north-south slopes gradient of plant communities: *South-facing plant communities: On south-facing slopes with cold and dry climate European black pine (Pinus nigra subsp. larico) is the dominant species. Pinus nigra subsp. larico is also found on Mount Etna up to the timberline along with the Etna birch (Betula aetniensis). Pinus heldreichii leucodermis is found only Pollino Mountains. *North-facing plant communities: On north-facing slopes Silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) mix with Pinus nigra subsp. larico. Relict stands of the endemic Nebrodi fir (Abies nebrodensis) appear in the Madonie Mountains. The Etna summits is characterized by a shrub community of Astragalus siculus, Berberis aetnensis, Juniperus communis alpina and the Etna tree-broom (Genista aetnensis). Fauna Large mammals include roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), European wildcat (Felis silvestris), and crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata). The Italian wolf (Canis lupus italicus) lives in the peninsular portion of the ecoregion, and Sila and Pollino national parks are home to Italy's largest wolf population. Wolves are absent from Sicily. Sicily's forests are home to the Sicilian shrew (Crocidura sicula), which is endemic to Sicily and Malta. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 6,008 km¬≤, or 46%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Aspromonte National Park, Sila National Park, and Pollino National Park, Appennino Lucano - Val d'Agri - Lagonegrese National Park, and Monte Piacentini Regional Park, Nebrodi Park, and Etna Park.

He confessed to four killings before being executed at Pentridge Prison, Victoria in 1936. Sodeman was the second of eleven people to be hanged at Pentridge Prison after the closure of Melbourne Gaol in 1929. Early life Arnold Karl Sodeman was born in Victoria in 1899. His mother suffered from bouts of amnesia and both his father and grandfather died in mental institutions. At 18, Sodeman was sent to a reformatory prison for larceny. Shortly after his release from the reformatory, he was charged with armed robbery and wounding the station master at Surrey Hills railway station. Sodeman was sent to prison to serve three years hard labour. Sodeman escaped from prison and was sentenced to a further 12 months imprisonment with hard-labour. Upon release, Sodeman settled down to various labouring jobs, first in Melbourne, and later in Gippsland. He married Bernice Pope at Collingwood and their daughter, Joan, was born in 1928. The marriage was considered a happy one; although Sodeman seemed to suffer from occasional bouts of depression and frequent drunkenness, he was never violent towards his family. He was reported to be hard-working, mild and amiable, with a generous disposition. Murders and arrest On 9 November 1930, Sodeman abducted a 12-year-old schoolgirl, Mena Griffiths. He came upon his victim at the local playground playing with a group of friends. He gave the other girls some money, and told them to go to the shop to get some ice-creams; meanwhile, he told his victim that he had a different errand for her to run. By the time the little girl's friends returned to the playground, there was no sign of Griffiths or the man. Griffiths' body was discovered two days later at Ormond, in an abandoned building. She had been strangled to death, then gagged and bound post-mortem with her own clothing. On 10 January 1931, he abducted 16-year-old Hazel Wilson and strangled her to death. Her body was also found in the suburb of Ormond. Again, in a signature move, he had gagged and tied her hands behind her back with portions of her clothing. Sodeman struck for the third time on 1 January 1935. His victim, Ethel Belshaw, was a 12-year-old girl whom he strangled then bound at the sea-side town of Inverloch. Belshaw was intending to buy an ice cream when she disappeared. On 1 December 1935, Sodeman killed his fourth victim, a 6-year-old girl named June Rushmer, the daughter of a coworker, who was taken from a local park. Her body was found the following day less than from her Leongatha home. She had also been bound, gagged and strangled. Witnesses stated that they had seen the child with a man on a bicycle shortly before her disappearance. Sodeman at the time was on a work crew repairing roadways. During a morning tea break a fellow worker jokingly stated he had seen Sodeman on his bike near the crime scene. Sodeman replied angrily that he wasn't there. He had answered with such anger and rage, which was very out of character for him, that the workers told police. Police took him away for questioning and he quickly confessed to the crimes. Police were initially skeptical of the confession, but Sodeman gave details of the crimes that only someone present could have known.  Inquest and trial  The court house at Leongatha was crowded when the Rushmer inquest commenced. The government pathologist, Dr. Mollison, said that the dead girl's hands were tied behind her back with a piece of cloth, and a bloodstained garment was pushed into her mouth. A piece of torn sock was tied around her neck. The body bore bruises. Death, he thought was due to suffocation. Nancy Viola Smith, aged 12, said that she played with Rushmer on the Leongatha reserve and that Rushmer left the park at 7.15 p.m. William Henry Money, of Leongatha said that at 7.15 p.m. he saw Sodeman riding his bicycle in the direction of the reserve. Sodeman had a strange look on his face and the witness thought it peculiar. Sodeman did not speak to him. Vincent Desmond Ryan of Leongatha, said that between 7.15 and 7.30 p.m. he saw a man with a little girl on the front of his cycle. The child was similar in build to Rushmer, but the witness was 80 metres (90 yards) away and could not see him properly. Senior Detective O'Keefe said that Detective Delminico was with Sodeman when he stated: > \\"I saw June Rushmer on the footpath walking towards her home near the tennis > court and she said, 'Give us a ride.' I knew her and she knew me. I agreed, > and rode down the stock route and turned down the road leading to the > sanitary depot. About 90 metres (100 yards) from the corner, she said, 'This > is far enough.' I got off the bike and said 'You can walk home.' I made a > run towards her and she ran into the bush. I ran after her, and caught her > round the neck, and she started to scream. I held her by the neck and she > went limp all of a sudden. I then took off her bloomers and jammed them into > her mouth. I got a belt from her frock and tied it over her mouth and round > the back of her neck.\\" Sodeman was then committed for trial by the coroner. In February 1936, at the conclusion of a two-day trial, the jury found him guilty of murder. The government medical officer, Dr A. J. W. Philpott, his assistant, Dr R. T. Allan, and a psychiatrist Dr Reginald Ellery all gave evidence that Sodeman was suffering from a disorder of the mind which created an 'obsessional impulse' of such power that‚Äîunder the influence of alcohol‚Äîhe was no longer responsible for his behaviour. Since Sodeman was intoxicated on all four occasions, the doctors concluded that he was insane at the times of the murders. Their conclusion was reinforced not only by Sodeman's repetitive behaviour, but also by his family's medical history: both his father and grandfather had died insane. Judge Charles Gavan Duffy then sentenced him to death for the murder of Rushmer having advised the jury to distinguish between opinions given by expert medical witnesses on matters relating to the physical body, which could be proved by surgery, and those concerning the mind. The jury, in making their decision, rejected Sodeman's defence of insanity. Appeals An extract from The Argus, on Friday 24 April 1936, read: > \\"An English King's Counsel has now been engaged to plead the case before the > Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Arnold Sodeman, who has been > condemned to death for the murder of June Rushmer at Leongatha. Sodeman's > solicitor (Mr. C H. Auty) said yesterday that he had arranged by cable > message for Mr D. N Pritt, K C, a leading Kings Counsel, and a member of the > House of Commons, to appear for Sodeman in the proposed application by him > for special leave to appeal against the refusal of the High Court of > Australia to grant him special leave to appeal against his conviction. Mr > Auty said that his agents in London would instruct Mr. Pritt and another > barrister, who would act as Mr Pritt's Junior, regarding the details of the > application. Meanwhile, Mr. Auty has addressed a written request to the > Premier Mr. Dunstan) that the Government should grant a further reprieve to > Sodeman until such time as the condemned man's application to the Privy > Council has been determined Mr Auty said yesterday that he was now > 'preparing the petition for special leave to appeal and other necessary > documents. He expected that those documents would be ready in time to be > despatched to England next week'.

Sodeman's appeal against his > conviction was unsuccessful. The grounds of the appeal were:-(1) That the > learned trial Judge wrongly admitted evidence, namely, the evidence of the > deaths of Mena Griffiths, Hazel Wilson, and Ethel Belshaw; (2) that the > learned trial judge misdirected the jury (a) as to the onus of proof in a > case of insanity, (b) as to the requirements of the law in relation to > insanity, and (c) as to the law relating to drink, insanity, and > manslaughter; and (3) that the prosecution and the learned trial Judge made > comments on the failure of the accused to give evidence.\\" Execution Sodeman had not wanted a reprieve because of the fear that if he lived he may have committed more murders. Sodeman spent a good deal of his time playing draughts with Edward Cornelius, who was under sentence of death for the murder of the Rev. Cecil in Fitzroy in November of last year. He was hanged and buried at Pentridge Prison, Coburg, on 1 June 1936. An autopsy disclosed that he was suffering from leptomeningitis, a degenerative disease which could cause serious congestion of the brain when aggravated by alcohol. Media In 1965, the Australian television series Homicide based episode 39, \\"A Lonely Place\\", on the case. The episode first went to air in November 1965, and was introduced by actor John Fegan warning of the importance of protecting children. Unlike many episodes, the episode ended without a voice over, stating what the legal results of the case had been (for example, whether the offender was sentenced to death but later reprieved). On the seventy-fifth anniversary of the murder of Ethel Belshaw, Leongatha newspaper ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôThe Great Southern Star‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô published an interview with Maureen Lewis (n√©e Keighery) who was the Soderman's neighbour in 1935. Lewis was with the Sodeman family on the same day he murdered Belshaw. Lewis had travelled with the Sodemans from Leongatha, for a fun day in the sun. She was friends with the Sodemans‚Äô child, Joan, a girl of similar age. ‚ÄúOn the day Ethel was murdered he wanted to take me for an ice cream. It could have been me that day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI went down there with them to Inverloch on that day with the Sodemans. ... He wanted to take me for an ice cream and Mrs Sodeman wouldn‚Äôt let him take me unless he also took Joan, his daughter.‚Äù (which Sodeman refused to do).

Keynote designs are her take on the shirt, gymslip, lace-up shoe, duffel coat and trench coat. With their androgynous quality, and sympathetically shot by photographers such as Bruce Weber, Koto Bolofo, and Alasdair McLellan, her clothes have been described as 'marrying traditional styles with modern appeal... [so] all her work... has a stylish timelessness.' She herself says, \\"My style could be described as understated quality, updated modern classics.\\" \\"I am often inspired by the method by which something is made... Good design has to work. Clothes have to work for people just as a chair has to...‚Äù Career ‚ÄúI had always made my own clothes, so the enjoyment of choosing the fabric and adapting the pattern to what I wanted was my training. [But] The 4 Year Dip Ad course [in Art and Design at Goldsmith's College, London] was an invaluable training in colour, proportion and design.\\" Graduating in 1969, Howell made accessories while job- hunting. In 1970 her hand-made beads were taken up by Vogue and, spotted in the window of Browns, led to a commission by costume designer Beatrice Dawson for a beaded vest for Elizabeth Taylor, then shooting 'Zee and Co' in London. In 1972 Howell began to design, make and sell shirts from a flat in Blackheath, south-east London, and was soon encouraged by orders from Joseph in London as well as US retailers, including Tommy Perse, Alan Bilzerian and Howard Partman, \\"... who were looking for more classic, interesting English clothes.\\" With Joseph's generous support a Margaret Howell franchise shop opened on South Molton Street, London in 1976. With husband Paul Renshaw as business partner Howell opened her first independent shop in St Christopher's Place, London in 1980. Recognition followed and the label grew. A profile in French Elle in 1977 noted: ‚ÄúIn her precise and meticulous working methods, Margaret Howell is more a craftsman than an industrialist.‚Äù Jack Nicholson was a fan and insisted on wearing his own Margaret Howell corduroy jacket for his role in 1980s The Shining, prompting an order for 12 duplicates from Stanley Kubrick. 1982 saw Grace Coddington choose a Howell piece as Dress of the Year. A New York City shop opened in Manhattan in 1982 and the first Margaret Howell standalone shop opened in Aoyama, Tokyo in 1983. However, this rapid expansion caused both business and personal difficulties. The couple divorced in 1987 and Renshaw left the company. It was restructured in 1990 with the help of Sam Sugure, responsible for Japanese licensing, and Richard Craig, who remains as managing director. The new management proved successful and steady growth followed. The company set up its own shirt factory in Edmonton, north London, in 2000 and opened the flagship Wigmore Street, London shop in 2002, designed collaboratively with Will Russell of Pentagram. Wigmore Street accommodates a design studio but also allows Howell to mount exhibitions, host events, and retail products that complements her own work, such as Poole Pottery, Ercol, Anglepoise, and designers such as Robert Welch and David Mellor. The MHL clothing line was introduced in 2004, and the first of a series of collaborations to produce a shirt with other designers ‚Äì Margaret Howell Plus ‚Äì began in 2010 with Kenneth Grange, followed by Sam Hecht, Dan Pearson and Georgina von Etzdorf. Today Margaret Howell employs some 500 people in more than 80 locations, including Paris, Florence and Tokyo. Howell's influences and interests ‚Äì architecture, fine art, modern design, photography, swimming and swimming pools, the landscape and traditional crafts of the British Isles ‚Äì are reflected in the series of calendars she has produced since 1995.

Life The son of William Pell, he was born at Sheffield in 1634. After passing through the grammar school at Rotherham, Yorkshire, he was admitted as sizar at the age of seventeen on 29 March 1651 to Magdalene College, Cambridge. There his tutor was Joseph Hill. He graduated M.A., was elected scholar 2 June 1654 and fellow 3 November 1656. He received orders from Ralph Brownrig, bishop of Exeter, probably at Sunning, Berkshire. He held the sequestered rectory of Easington, County Durham, and a tutorship in the college at Durham recently founded by Oliver Cromwell. At the Restoration Durham College collapsed, and Clark, the sequestered rector of Easington, was restored. Pell was appointed to the rectory of Great Stainton, Durham, which he held until ejected in 1662. After ejection he preached in conventicles, and was imprisoned at Durham for nonconformity. Taken to London by habeas corpus, he was discharged by Sir Matthew Hale. He then went to the North Riding of Yorkshire, and practised medicine. He had a reputation as an orientalist, though he published nothing, leaving unfinished collections including rabbinical studies. Friends asked him to resume the work of teaching at university level. He considered himself constrained: by the terms of his graduation oath, as he understood it, he should not lecture outside the ancient universities. The project of instituting a new ‚Äònorthern academy‚Äô passed into the hands of Richard Frankland, who founded in Rathmell Academy one of the first dissenting academies. After the indulgence of 1672 he preached in public at Tattershall, Lincolnshire, and was protected by holding the office of domestic steward to Edward Clinton, 5th Earl of Lincoln. A London merchant of the same surname, but not a kinsman, became his benefactor. On James II's declaration for liberty of conscience (1687), he became pastor to the nonconformists at Boston, Lincolnshire. He moved in 1694 to become the assistant of Richard Gilpin, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Here he died on 2 December 1698, in his sixty-third year. He was buried on 6 December at St. Nicholas's Church, Newcastle. He married Elizabeth (buried 30 January 1708), daughter of George Lilburn of Sunderland.

It is stationed at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. The 91 OG is one of three USAF operational missile units, equipped with the LGM-30G Minuteman- III. Its mission is to defend the United States with safe and secure Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs); ready to immediately put bombs on target. Activated as the World War II 91st Bombardment Group (Heavy), an Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress unit assigned to England, it was one of the first USAAF heavy bomb groups deployed to Europe in 1942. The 91st Bomb Group was stationed at RAF Bassingbourn and is most noted as the unit in which the bomber Memphis Belle flew, and for having suffered the greatest number of losses of any heavy bomb group in World War II. As part of Strategic Air Command in the early years of the Cold War, the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group provided worldwide surveillance. Inactivated in 1952, the group was reactivated as the 91 OG in 1991. Its three missile squadrons, however, have no traditional link to the 91st Bombardment Group and were previously part of the 455th Strategic Missile Wing and 455th Bomb Group. Units Through its five squadrons, the group remains a key facet of our nation's deterrent force. The five squadrons assigned to the group are the: * 740th Missile Squadron * 741st Missile Squadron * 742d Missile Squadron * 91st Operations Support Squadron * 54th Helicopter Squadron The Missile Squadrons include missile crewmembers, alert facility chefs and facility managers. These squadrons vigilantly maintain the missile force around-the-clock. Each squadron controls 50 launch facilities and five missile alert facilities. Missile squadrons are divided into missile operations flights and an operation support flight. The missile operations flights are staffed by officer crewmembers who, when on alert, are responsible for day-to-day operations, maintenance and security of the missiles within their control and are prepared to launch their missiles at all times. Facility managers are responsible for and ensure the readiness of the missile alert facilities. The alert facility chefs are responsible for providing meals to missile alert facility personnel.

The crew became prisoners of war. Trained with B-17s before moving to England, August‚ÄìOctober 1942. Entered combat in November 1942, bombing such targets as submarine pens, airdromes, factories, communication targets, shipbuilding yards, harbors, and dock facilities until mid-1943. When Eighth Air Force heavy bombers first penetrated Germany on 27 January 1943, the group attacked the navy yard at Wilhelmshaven. Earned a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for bombing marshalling yards at Hamm on 4 March 1943, despite adverse weather and heavy opposition. From the middle of 1943 until the war ended, attacked aircraft factories, airfields, oil facilities, chemical industries and ball-bearing factories. Earned a second DUC for attacking vital aircraft factories in central Germany on 11 January 1944 despite inadequate fighter cover, heavy enemy opposition, and bad weather. In June 1944, contributed to the Allied invasion of Normandy by bombing gun emplacements and troop concentrations near the beachhead area. Supported the St. Lo breakthrough by attacking enemy troop positions, 24‚Äì25 July 1944. In December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945, participated in the Battle of the Bulge by attacking enemy communication targets. The group supported the Allied crossing of the Rhine River in the spring of 1945 by striking airfields, bridges, and railroads near the front lines. After the war ended, evacuated prisoners from German camps. Returned to the United States, June‚ÄìJuly 1945 Cold War Emblem of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group North American RB-45C Tornado 48-037, 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group. Only 33 RB-45s were ever built and the 91st SRG was the main operating unit for this airframe. Flight of three Convair RB-36D Peacemakers used to fly high altitude reconnaissance over Manchuria It was activated as a long-range photographic reconnaissance group under Strategic Air Command in July 1947, but was not fully manned until after July 1948. It saw combat in Korea from November 1950 to July 1953 and conducted surveillance over Sea of Japan. During the Korean War, the 91st SRG eventually flew the largest number of different airframes in the Korean War and had more assigned personnel than any other flying unit in the Korean War. With over 800 assigned personnel, they had six different types of aircraft assigned: the RB-29, RB-50, RB-45, WB-26, KB-29 and RB-36. Throughout the conflict though, the RB-29 and RB-50s were the workhorses of the unit. The RB-50 was a modification of the high-altitude bomber built towards the end of World War II to bomb Japan. The 91st worked a number of different missions during the Korean War. In addition to bomb damage assessment, targeting and aerial photography for the Bomber Command and FEAF, the 91st conducted ELINT and \\"ferret\\" missions in theater. It conducted the first ferret missions ever conducted by the USAF. Overflights of Soviet-controlled Far East islands began in 1951. An example of this type of work was reconnaissance missions which were conducted over Karafuto following reports that the Soviets had built extensive underground installations and missile-launching facilities on the island. In Project 51, 91st SRW RB-45s took off from Yokota AB, Japan to conduct reconnaissance over the southern portions of Sakhalin Island. Photographic and radar reconnaissance overflight missions were also flown over the Murmansk-Kola inlet and Siberia. The unit was also called upon to conduct psychological leaflet drops with its assigned RB-29 aircraft. Not only did the 91st drop Korean \\"Psyops\\" leaflets throughout the Korean peninsula and into Manchuria and China but Russian-language leaflets were also committed to air bases in the Far East where Russian pilots were suspected of flying from. 91st aircraft also provided the Air Force's first air-to-air refueling capability and is credited with the first refueling conducted in combat. In February 1951, it lost most of its personnel when assigned to the parent wing, and was inactivated in May 1952 as part of the Tri-Deputation reorganization. Modern era Between September 1991 and July 1994, and since February 1996, maintained intercontinental ballistic missiles on alert at Minot AFB, ND.

Activists inspired by the land rights campaign group The Land is Ours occupied the long derelict site on 6 June 2009. The Royal Botanic Gardens, the world's largest collection of living plants and pioneer of horticultural preservation, face the ecovillage site on the opposite side of the river. The community was reported as saying it wishes to demonstrate the practicality of permaculture principles, living in simple bender structures, growing its own vegetables and recycling its waste. On 27 May 2010 police evicted the ecovillage inhabitants. The site The approximately one-acre brownfield site, formerly occupied by the Scottish Widows insurance company, is reported to have been vacant for more than 20 years. As of the 17th of February 2010 the current owners, the property development company St George, have been given planning permission by Hounslow Council for 164 flats, a business centre, gym and pub. St George PLC were granted a possession order for the land in Brentford County Court on 7 May 2010. The residents In December 2009 the ecovillage had 32 permanent residents. Structures included a shower, compost toilet, and kitchen, mostly bender tents made from tree branches and recycled materials. Consensus decision making was the basis for community organisation, informed by an intention to live a more simple and eco-friendly existence. Food supply was augmented by regular trips to local grocery bins and skips, some residents describing themselves as freegans. The community included some previously homeless people; others left houses and jobs in order to apply on a daily basis principles of anti-consumerism. After the village was disbanded, some of its residents joined the Hounslow Community Land Project, which squatted a derelict piece of land for six months in 2010, and Parliament Square's Democracy Village, set up in May 2010. Community events The ecovillage conducted a programme of events that have included arts and crafts workshops, film shows, yoga and face-painting classes, pagan festivals, live poetry and music. It also commenced an annual seed swap.Ecovillage seed swap Kew Gardens itself (see above) houses one of the world's largest seedbanks. Documentary film Documentary filmmaker Dean Puckett, a resident of the Kew Bridge Ecovillage from its inception, documented the daily lives of its inhabitants of the village as it evolved over the year of its life. The film, Grasp the Nettle, was released in 2013 after showing at documentary festivals around the world such as DOK Leipzig and London's Open City Docs Fest. In 2014 Puckett put the film up online for free viewing on his Vimeo page.

He attended the Royal High School and was at one time apprenticed to a goldsmith. Campbell helped found the Magdalene Society, a Religious Tract Society of Scotland in 1793, and the Missionary Magazine in Edinburgh in 1796. His consuming interest in Christian philanthropy led him to preach widely in neglected villages and hamlets, promote the establishing of numerous Sunday schools and found societies like the Magdalene Asylum to help prostitutes in Edinburgh and Glasgow. His opposition to the slave trade led to his involvement in the foundation of the Society for the Education of Africans. He collaborated with James Alexander Haldane in bringing some 30-40 African children to be educated in England. Following the Haldane Revival, Campbell became a Congregational Church minister. He was minister at Kingsland, an independent chapel he had founded, from 1802. He was instrumental in founding the British and Foreign Bible Society and became a director of the London Missionary Society. The London Missionary Society sent him to the Cape in June 1812 to inspect the mission stations there. He set off from Cape Town in February 1813, calling in at Bethelsdorp and Grahamstown, then the military headquarters. Heading north he visited Graaff-Reinet and Klaarwater (later Griquatown), and then travelled further north to Litakun, the kraal of the Batlhaping kgosi (chief) Mothibi. His return trip went via Klaarwater, Pella and the Kamiesberge, arriving in Cape Town at the end of October. He wrote an account of this trip as \\"Travels in South Africa, undertaken at the request of the Missionary Society\\" and it was published on his return to London in 1815. The town of Campbell, east of Griquatown, was named in his honour. Campbell returned to the Cape in February 1819 in the company of Dr. John Philip. His orders were to inspect and improve the mission stations which had fallen into a neglected state. On this visit he instructed the missionary Robert Moffat to start a mission among the Bechuana tribe. Campbell once more ventured into the interior, leaving Cape Town in January 1820 and travelling as far north as Mosega in Barotseland, on which journey he also came across the large settlement of Kaditshwene near the Limpopo River. He left for England in February 1821, publishing two further volumes covering his second journey. He subsequently delivered a series of lectures on his missionary work.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa vol 3 ReferencesBibliography * * Category:1766 births Category:1840 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Scottish Congregationalist missionaries Category:Congregationalist missionaries in South Africa Category:18th-century Scottish people Category:19th-century Scottish people Category:Scottish goldsmiths Category:People educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh Category:Scottish explorers Category:Scottish magazine publishers (people) Category:Scottish philanthropists Category:Slavery and religion Category:Scottish abolitionists Category:Scottish Congregationalist ministers ","title":"John Campbell (missionary)"},{"id":"25878194","text":"The Spirit Engine 2 is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling indie RPG drawn, programmed and written by Mark Pay with music by Josh Whelchel. The title is an improved spiritual sequel to The Spirit Engine, a freeware 2D RPG released in 2003. Gameplay The player's party (left) battling a group of enemies (right). Outside of combat, the player can move the party along sidescrolling levels, speaking to NPCs and obtaining missions, purchasing or selling items to equip on characters, and moving between areas. Enemy encounters are not random, although enemy type is sometimes randomized. Special statues function as save points. The Spirit Engine 2's battle system takes place in real time, and characters attack automatically. Battle speed may be sped up, slowed down, or paused. The game removes the mana mechanic of The Spirit Engine that allowed for a limited number of attacks before needing to recharge, and players' actions can be paused to build up extra attack power or wait for an opening. The two teams form lines on either side of the screen. On one side is the player's three characters, on the other side are the enemies currently being fought. The player can rotate the three party members: changing who is in front, in the middle, and in the back. Melee attacks cause characters to change positions, potentially becoming vulnerable, while ranged attacks can strike back row, or multiple characters. Party members have \\"damage multipliers\\" which rise as the number of continuous hits sustained increases and vice versa. Characters, both player and enemy, are automatically revived after a certain amount of time with decreased health. All health is restored between battles. Each combatant has a unique set of skills that they can draw from. Unlike the \\"regular actions\\" of The Spirit Engine, skills must be used at all times, and consist of four damage types. \\"Skill chains\\" can be formed for each player, or for the entire party, before battle takes place, and allow a number of skills to be used in sequence depending on the situation. The player characters‚Äô actions begin relatively weak, but can be improved by investing skill points. When the player's party gains enough experience through defeating enemies, it will gain a level. Higher level parties have more powerful actions in general, however each individual character gains one skill point when the party increases in level. These skill points allow the player to specialize their party members. Skills can only be increased up to a quarter of the party level, and higher level skills are boosted less per skill point. Characters also gain \\"refund points\\" which can be used to free previously assigned skill points. Plot The player can initially choose from a grid of nine different party members, with three per class and personality type. While the party members can occupy any class (knight, musketeer, or priest), one of each personality type (antihero, naive, and logical) is needed. Each party member has unique dialogue and plot-related events due to their differing backstories. The game takes place in Lereftain, a country under a tenuous peace treaty with the neighboring nation of Yaegara. The continent of Medea is ruled over by the tentacled, psychic Rakari, who are accepted by most humans, including the Lereftese Parliament, but held in suspicion by some due to their mysterious motives. The Rakari also function as a peacekeeping force by removing criminals from the population and rehabilitating them. The three characters are brought together after witnessing an unexplained murder by a cult called the Keepers, and set out to discover the Keepers' motives. In the process, they discover a plot of political intrigue that threatens to send the two countries to war. Development The game was drawn, programmed and written by Mark Pay. Its soundtrack was composed by Josh Whelchel and sold in a four-disc set on his website. In February 2010, the game was released as freeware. Reception The Spirit Engine 2 won the GameTunnel \\"Top Independent RPG of 2008\\" and \\"#2 Independent Game of 2008\\" awards. GameTunnel's Michael Scarpelli praised the two-dimensional game as \\"a side-scrolling, pixel graphic, content-heavy piece of awesome.\\" It received an 89/100 from RPGFan's Patrick Gann, who called it \\"tons of fun\\" and \\"so far removed from the quality of its predecessor that it deserves to be paid for. TIGSource's Derek Yu commented that it \\"improves on the original in almost every way\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Kieron Gillen called the game \\"delectable and novel\\", believing that the game would attract \\"non- traditional jRPG fans\\" despite the \\"linear story\\" due to the different character permutations. Gillen called the game's literalization of linearity \\"appealing\\", expressing his disappointment that Pay did not attempt to market the game more. Upcoming Mark Pay has stated on the official Spirit Engine forums that he might create a new game in the series, or an RPG instalment taking place within a different universe. Since this news got out there had been no further information given on if and when the game will be released. He has however been working on a web-comic/graphic novel called The Space Between which takes place within a dystopian science fiction universe, drawn with an art style similar to the Spirit Engine games.The Space Between by Mark Pay  http://the-space-between.com/ ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Original developer's website *Composer's website Category:2008 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games Category:Freeware games ","title":"The Spirit Engine 2"},{"id":"25878232","text":"Llanwnda Pencaer is a community which covers an area of dispersed settlement in Pembrokeshire, Wales, on the peninsula of Pen Caer and comprises the village of Llanwnda and smaller settlements such as Granston, Llangloffan, St Nicholas and Tremarchog.

The pose is ancient as it is described in the Darshana Upanishad, written around the 4th century. It is sometimes used for meditation and pranayama. Description The pose is entered from kneeling by crossing the legs; the heel of the upper leg is tucked in under the lower thigh near the buttock. The arm on the lower leg side is raised, the forearm bent down, while the other arm reaches down behind the back, the forearm bent up, so the hands can clasp between the shoulder blades. The sitting position can be modified either by putting a folded blanket on the heels, and if need be also one beneath them. The pose stretches the shoulders. The hand position can be modified using a strap to extend the reach for those who cannot bring the hands together behind the back. The pose is contra-indicated for people with a rotator cuff injury.

He then escaped into a forest and shot at a police helicopter searching for him, but eventually surrendered himself to authorities. On February 15, 2013, Speight was sentenced to life imprisonment. The shooting The incident began on January 19, 2010, when police were called to a road outside Appomattox on a report of a man who required medical attention. When police arrived, they were fired on by the suspect, Christopher Bryan Speight, who also fired on a police helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing. Shortly afterwards, the suspect fled to a wooded area, where a force of more than a hundred police officers surrounded him. Police found three people dead in a house co-owned by the gunman (his sister and the house's co-owner, Lauralee Sipe, and her husband, Dwayne Sipe, both 38, and their four-year-old son, Joshua), and four others dead outside the house, with the last victim dying on the road. Police said that the victims were both men and women, and all were previously acquainted with the suspect. Speight was believed to have acted alone. He surrendered on January 20, near the same wooded area where police thought he had been surrounded. He was wearing a bulletproof vest, but was not carrying the high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used. Prior to his surrender, police put a school and local businesses on lockdown, and advised residents to lock their houses and not go outside. Police were concerned that Speight's house had been rigged with explosives, and a bomb squad searched the building the morning after the attack. Explosives were found both inside and around the building, and were detonated safely. The house had sat unsecured for more than twelve hours as state police assumed local deputies had secured the house, and vice versa. Speight was employed as a security guard for Old Dominion Security at the time of the incident. Victims *Lauralee Sipe, 38, Speight's sister *Dwayne S.

He was ordered sent to a state psychiatric hospital until such a time when he is able to assist his attorneys with his defense. Two years after the shootings, police revealed that the three Sipes in the house were likely killed two days before Speight fatally shot the other five victims. The case remained on hold for years as attorneys dealt with pretrial motions and awaited additional mental evaluations. According to investigators Speight told them that he had been ordered by an Egyptian goddess named Jennifer to shoot his family, because they were possessed by demons. The others were killed, he said, so they could not help his first victims, since Jennifer demanded that their bodies had to rot. On February 15, 2013, Speight was sentenced in a plea deal to five life terms plus 18 years on three counts of capital murder, one count of attempted capital murder of a police officer (presumably because of the shots fired at the state police helicopter), and five firearms counts.

Ra√∫l Paz left Cuba in 1993, went to South America and then wound up in Paris, France to study at the Schola Cantorum. He met there his wife, Rachelle, and later had two sons, Rocco his eldest, and Raphael. In the mid-1990s, Paris was a melting pot for music. Raul hung out on the Latino scene, playing in the clubs New Morning, Hot Brass and Bataclan. He became one of the pioneers of the new Cuban wave. He was then spotted by Ralph Mercado, founder of the RMM label, and recorded his first album, Cuba Libre, in Gloria Estefan's studio in Miami.

It develops the capacities of education actors to plan and manage their education systems through its programmes of training, technical assistance, policy research and knowledge sharing.  Origins  A Committee chaired by Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders with Guy Benveniste as Rapporteur met in June 1962 and recommended the creation of the Institute.The UNESCO General Conference adopted their recommendations in the fall of 1962 and the French Government provided a building to house this new institution. Philip Hall Coombs who had been the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs in the Kennedy administration, was appointed as its first Director in 1963. The Institute, while an arm of UNESCO, was established as a semi-independent institution with its own board headed by a chair appointed by the Director General of UNESCO. Originally, the Institute was financed jointly by UNESCO and the World Bank (IBRD) since that second institution was just beginning to finance educational projects in developing countries. Help was also provided in those first years by the Ford Foundation. Later, it was integrated more closely with, and financed mainly by, UNESCO. The Institute organized its first major seminar in the spring of 1964 when 80 participants from Latin America attended meetings in Paris. The first publication from this encounter was issued in 1965.  Mission  As the only specialized organization with the mandate to support educational policy, planning and management, IIEP plays a unique role within the United Nations system. IIEP's mission is to strengthen the capacity of countries. It helps UNESCO's Member States to manage their educational system and to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda. The International Institute for Educational Planning offers training in educational planning and management, but also explores fields such as statistical tools for educational planning, strategies and policy options, projects, budgets, monitoring and evaluating educational quality and access. Its programs are designed for planners, policy-makers and researchers. IIEP targets both institutions and individuals, and works in both the national and international arenas. IIEP's research projects identify new approaches that planners could adopt to improve equity, access and quality in the various educational sectors. Costs and financing, along with governance and management, are also important research fields at IIEP. IIEP's technical assistance projects offer on-site coaching to ministry planning departments, so that they can quickly become autonomous in the performance of their basic duties. By building the capacity of individuals and of local, regional and national institutions, IIEP's technical assistance enables countries to make the most of their own expertise and to minimize their use of outside consultants. For instance, IIEP has created tailored programs to help governments in emergencies and fragile contexts, to maintain or rebuild their educational system.  IIEP and Education Sector Planning  IIEP supports ministries of education to plan and prepare their education sector plans Strategic Planning: Concept and Rational Education Sector Working Papers. through long-term technical involvement or more focused interventions. Making progress in education demands that countries have a clear vision of their priorities and how to achieve these. Many ministries therefore prepare strategic plans, which reflect this vision and help mobilize people and resources. Strategic planning guides educational development by giving a common vision and shared priorities. Educational planning is both visionary and pragmatic, engaging a wide range of actors in defining education‚Äôs future and mobilizing resources to reach its goals. A wide range of ministries worked in partnership with IIEP to develop their plans. In some countries, the Institute supports the whole process of formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of these plans; in others, it offers advice and assistance in specific areas as requested by the ministry. In all cases, the joint efforts is aimed at strengthening the capacity and autonomy of ministries and their staff. IIEP gives special attention to working with countries faced with the challenges of emergencies and reconstruction (sometimes referred to as ‚Äòfragile‚Äô contexts) which are farthest away from achieving the EFA and the MDG goals.

The clip method is losing popularity as more and more chains are manufactured as endless loops not intended for maintenance. Modern motorcycles are often fitted with an endless chain but in the increasingly rare circumstances of the chain wearing out and needing to be replaced, a length of chain and a joining link (with horseshoe clip) will be provided as a spare. Changes in motorcycle suspension are tending to make this use less prevalent. Common on older motorcycles and older bicycles (e.g. those with hub gears) this clip method cannot be used on bicycles fitted with derailleur gears, as the clip will tend to catch on the gear-changers. In many cases, an endless chain cannot be replaced easily since it is linked into the frame of the machine (this is the case on the traditional bicycle, amongst other places). However, in some cases, a joining link with horseshoe clip cannot be used or is not preferred in the application either. In this case, a \\"soft link\\" is used, placed with a chain riveter and relying solely on friction. With modern materials and tools and skilled application this is a permanent repair having almost the same strength and life of the unbroken chain.

Life He was born in Esher, Surrey into a family of chemical manufacturers and educated in Broadstairs, Kent and at Oundle. He gained a 1st Class Honours Degree at Oxford in 1943 under eminent physicist Sir Harold Warris Thompson and continued the pursuit of postgraduate research with Thompson until 1949. He worked in a number of areas including Radar and fuel analysis during the war. He spent a year in 1946-47 at the Bell Telephone Research Laboratories at Murray Hill, New Jersey, working with five Nobel Laureates. In nine months Whiffen developed a sensitive experimental cell usable over a wide range of temperature. On his return to England he accepted a post as lecturer in the Chemistry Department at Birmingham University from 1949 to 1959. Most of his papers at that time pushed the boundaries on infra red absorption frequencies of materials. He then became head of the Molecular Science Division at the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) from 1959 to 1968, leaving to be successively Head of Physical Chemistry, Professor of Physics, Dean of Science and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at Newcastle University between 1968 and 1983. His primary area of expertise during those years was radiation and how it is absorbed by materials and what this tells us about the radiation and the materials themselves. Whiffen worked out the electron-spin resonance signal of a free radical in a crystal lattice. He was a spectroscopist, chemical physicist, specialist in wave superposition, the interaction between radiation and matter, and a pioneer in ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) and later NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1966. He retired in 1985 to Somerset where he died aged 80. He had married Jean Bell in Glasgow in 1949. Their four sons survived him. The Whiffen Effect Spin paired molecules. In EPR spectroscopy of organic radicals the effect explains the way hyperconjugative proton coupling in a cyclic radical can be enhanced or forbidden according to the symmetry of the orbital with which it hyperconjugates, opening the way to other work in the field. Other significant contributions He was known as a very practical man, but with deep intellect and understanding. He constructed a 9 GHz Spectrometer at the NPL and turned it into one of the world's top ESR and NMR Laboratories, testing theories and models. He was the first to successfully test the predictions of the underlying theory of Peter Debye, the Dutch-American theoretical physicist who received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1936 for his work on molecular structure, the theory of dipole moments in liquids and the diffraction of X-rays and electrons in gases. He was not known as self promotional, and when on arrival at Newcastle Chemistry Professor Clemo suggested people were saying he 'shouldn't have come' he merely raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly in apparent agreement. He was seen as exceptionally effective and a memorial lecture is held in his name. Obituary His obituary in The Independent said; 'In Birmingham David Whiffen also became interested in the free radicals, thought to be involved in some polymerisations, and constructed a very early electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer to investigate them, obtaining some success with powders and √£-ray irradiated powders. A study by Ubersfeld and Erb then showed that an irradiated crystal of glycine exhibited a spectrum which varied with its orientation in the magnetic field. He rapidly developed the techniques required to further such studies and the theory to interpret the results. This was world-leading research which established his reputation in the field. The paper on glycine, published in Molecular Physics in 1959, was the first of many that identified the structure of free radicals produced in irradiated crystals.'

In central Africa, it is found in the Ubangui River ecosystem. It typically inhabits tropical freshwater ecosystems between . It was originally described by Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger as Barbus baudoni in 1918, and the holotype, collected from Bangui, Central African Republic, is stored at the Mus√©um national d‚ÄôHistoire naturelle in Paris. The species was originally classified in the Barbus genus, but was reclassified as belonging to the Enteromius genus in 2015 after examining extensive taxon, geographical, and genomic sampling of the species in the family Cyprinidae. The fish grows to standard length and many specimens contain 3 small spots that are aligned on the middle of the sides of the fish. These spots are frequently linked with a distinct longitudinal band. The caudal fin is forked and the fish has two pairs of barbels. Enteromius baudoni are benthopelagic, potamodromous fish that are harvested for human consumption. Threats to the species include deforestation, which leads to additions of silt in their ecosystem. The species was evaluated in 2009, and found to be of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

According to that system, Ge 2/2 denotes a narrow gauge electric adhesion locomotive with a total of two axles, both of which are drive axles. There are only two locomotives in the class, and they are numbered 161 and 162. Both direct current locomotives were procured by the Berninabahn (BB) in 1911 for piloting duties. The then still brown liveried machines were given the numbers Ge 2/2 61 and 62, and were equipped with Lyra pantographs. After the Rhaetian Railway takeover of the BB, they were given the new numbers they still bear. Today, they work mainly as shunting locomotives in Poschiavo. On the Appenzeller Bahnen (AB), there is another locomotive, Te 49, that is of similar appearance, and dates from 1912. Between 1955 and 1975, it operated as Ge 2/2 49.

The ruins of the building with Osney Lock in the foreground. Osney Mill is a former flour mill on a branch of the River Thames in Oxford, England, located south of the Botley Road, down Mill Street. While the mill was gutted by a fire in 1945 and remained derelict for over 60 years, the exterior walls were incorporated into a modern apartment building during the early-2010s that now occupies the site. Close by the site of the mill is Osney Lock. To the east is Osney Cemetery, to the west is Osney Island, while Oxford railway station lies just to the north.  History  The mill is on the site of the now-destroyed Osney Abbey. Little is left of the abbey, but there is still a rubble and timber-framed structure at the mill site, which may date from the 15th century. The remnants were Grade II listed in 1954. In 1895, William Henry Munsey came to Oxford after his farming business in Cambridgeshire was affected by foot and mouth disease. Initially, he worked for Pratt & Haines as a forage manager. In 1898, he went into partnership with Archer Cowley and took over Osney Mill. The partnership did not last and the business became W.H. Munsey Ltd in 1911. The mill produced flour for bread but was destroyed by fire in 1945. It was decided not to rebuild Osney Mill and the business moved to Wantage, south of Oxford, although the family still owns the site. In 2004, there were plans for a new development of homes, after planning approval by Oxford City Council. An Oxford building contractor, Knowles & Son, was contracted to turn the derelict mill building into flats. Work started on renovation in January 2011 and has now been completed.

Originally created in 1907 by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, it expanded as the Army's air assets increased. Candidates originally had to be between the ages of 19 and 25, athletic, and honest. Two years of college or three years of a scientific or technical education were required. Cadets were supposed to be unmarried and pledged not to marry during training. From 1907 to 1920, pilot officers were considered part of the Signal Corps or the Signal Officer Reserve Corps. After 1920, they were considered part of their own separate organization, the U.S. Army Air Service (1918‚Äì1926). The U.S. Army Air Corps Training Center (USAACTC) was at Duncan Field, San Antonio, Texas from 1926 to 1931 and Randolph Field from 1931 to 1939. Two more centers were activated on 8 July 1940: the West Coast Army Air Corps Training Center (WCAACTC) in Sunnyvale, California and the Southeast Army Air Corps Training Center (SAACTC) in Montgomery, Alabama. The SAACTC was later renamed the Gulf Coast Army Air Corps Center (GCAACTC). In 1942, the Army moved the WCAACTC from Moffett Field to Santa Ana Army Air Base (SAAAB), located on West 8th Street in Santa Ana, California. On 23 January 1942 the USAAF created the separate Air Corps Flying Training Command and the Air Corps Technical Training Command to control all aspects of technical and aviation training. Originally formed in Washington, D.C., they moved to facilities at Fort Worth, Texas in July. They were renamed the Army Air Forces Flight Training Command and Army Air Forces Technical Training Command respectively in March, 1942. They were later unified as the Army Air Forces Training Command (July, 1943 - June, 1946).

The Air Force program stopped taking civilian and enlisted pilot candidates in 1961 and navigator candidates in 1965. Enlisted Pilots (1912-42) The first enlisted U.S. Army pilot was Corporal Vernon L. Burge, a crew chief at the U.S. Army's flight school in the Philippines. When Captain Frank P. Lahm, the school's commander, couldn't find enough commissioned officer applicants, he trained Burge, who received his FAI pilot's license on 14 June 1912. Although the practice was officially condemned, the Army later relented, as Burge was already a trained aviator. The second was Corporal William A. Lamkey. Lamkey entered the Army Signal Corps in 1913, but had already received his FAI license from the Moisant Aviation School in 1912. Lamkey later left the Army to work as a mercenary pilot. The third pilot was Sergeant William C. Ocker. Ocker was denied pilot training because he was an enlisted man, so he became an aircraft mechanic instead. In his off hours he exchanged work for flight lessons from the nearby Curtiss Flying School. Eventually, he qualified for his FAI license on 20 April 1914, receiving certificate #293. Ocker did mostly test pilot work to accrue flight hours and tested many experimental or early prototype aircraft. He is famous for inventing \\"blind flying\\" training to teach pilots to fly by instruments in cloudy or dark conditions. World War I (1914-18) Only 29 enlisted pilots were created by 1914 and most were commissioned as second lieutenants in 1917. From 1914 to 1918, sixty mechanics were trained as pilots. They were used as ferry pilots and did not fly in combat. Their primary job was to transfer new and repaired aircraft from rear areas to air bases and forward air fields. They would then fly patched-up damaged aircraft back for more thorough repairs. The Army Air Corps Act of 1926 set certain standards as part of a five-year program to expand and improve the aviation arm of the U.S. Army. It set a quota that 20% of a tactical aviation unit's pilot billets must be manned by enlisted pilots by 1929. By 1930, only 4% of all pilots were enlisted. New pilots were usually commissioned to meet the need for pilot-rated officers in Air Corps administrative and command billets. Enlisted pilots didn't have a place in the hierarchy when they stopped flying and either reverted to their old pre-flying trade or were discharged. In 1933, the training and creation of enlisted pilots was discontinued due to budget cuts and lack of funds. World War II (1939-45) In 1939 there were only 55 enlisted pilots in the then-U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC). On 3 June 1941, Public Law 99 was enacted, allowing enlisted men to apply to flight training. Candidates had to be between the ages of 18 and 22, have a high school diploma with at least 1.5 credit hours worth of math, and have graduated in the top half of their class. In November 1941, this was reduced to being at least 18 years old and possessing a high school diploma. After demand lifted in mid-1944, the requirements went back to college-educated or college graduate candidates. Enlisted pilots were called flying sergeants. Graduating enlisted pilots were graded as flight staff sergeants while pilots who graduated at the top of their class were graded as flight technical sergeants. They were usually assigned to flying transport and liaison aircraft. Their pilot status was only indicated by their pilot's wings, often leading to enlisted aviators being mistaken for air crew or harassed for impersonating a pilot. This caused a lot of bad feelings between the enlisted pilots (who had more dangerous jobs for lower pay and no privileges) and the officer pilots (who received the same pay, promotability, and privileges as officers). The first enlisted pilot cadets were part of class 42C (enrolling in November, 1941 and graduating on 7 March 1942), which trained at Kelly Field and Ellington Field, Texas. 93 enlisted graduates became P-38 fighter pilots and were assigned to the 82nd Fighter Group in North Africa. Members of this class shot down 130 enemy aircraft and nine became aces. The program created 2,576 enlisted pilots from 1941 to 1942. 332 enlisted pilots served overseas and 217 of them flew combat missions. Enlisted pilots destroyed 249.5 enemy aircraft and 18 became aces. Lt. William J. Sloan was the leading ace of the 12th Air Force with 12 victories. When Public Law 658 (Flight Officer Act)Flight Officer Act, Pub. L. no. 77-658, 56 Stat. 649 (1942) was passed on 8 July 1942 most enlisted pilots were promoted to the new rank of flight officer and newly-graduating enlisted pilots were graded as flight officers or second lieutenants depending on merit. This ended the creation of enlisted pilots in the U.S. Army. Overview The U.S. Army created almost 3,000 enlisted pilots from 1912 to 1942. Seven pre-War enlisted pilots and four World War II enlisted pilots became U.S. Air Force generals. =Last Enlisted Pilot= The U.S. Air Force's last enlisted pilot was Master Sergeant George H. Holmes (b.1898-d.1965). Holmes had enlisted in the Army as a mechanic in 1919, became a pilot with the rank of corporal in 1921, and was promoted to lieutenant's rank in the Army Reserve in 1924. The Army later made Holmes an enlisted man and he served as both a mechanic and a pilot in the 1920s and 1930s. He was promoted to captain in 1942 and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946. He resigned his commission and reverted to his enlisted rank of master sergeant in 1946. He continued to fly as a non- commissioned officer until he retired in May 1957. Flying Cadet Program (1918‚Äì40) In 1918, flying cadets wore standard Army uniform and were differenced by a white piqu√© hatband on the service cap or service hat and white brassards on both sleeves. Flying cadets were dubbed \\"Twelve-and-a- halfs\\" because they were considered between pay grade 12 (officer cadet) and pay grade 13a (regimental sergeant major) in rank, being neither officer nor enlisted. Cadets were paid the same as Privates, but earned a 50% bonus for flight pay. In June 1918, the Air Service insignia of a winged single-prop propeller replaced the Signal Corps insignia. In 1925, they were allowed to wear the overseas cap and had branch of service piping of ultramarine blue with threads of golden orange. From 1928 to 1942, flying cadets wore a distinctive slate-blue uniform. Visor-cap insignia was a pair of gold wings (3 inches wide) and a silver propeller (2 inches high). Flight cadet insignia was worn on the lower right sleeve. Rank insignia was worn on the upper sleeves and consisted of 1 to 4-point-down black mohair chevrons on slate blue backing to indicate the following equivalent ranks: cadet corporal (1 chevron), cadet sergeant (2 chevrons), cadet lieutenant (3 chevrons), and cadet captain (4 chevrons). Chevrons were 2.875-inches wide for jackets and shirts and 7-inches wide for overcoats. 1907‚Äì17 The U.S. Army Signal Corps Aviation School was first based at College Park, Maryland from 1907 to 1912. It later moved in 1912 to Rockwell Field, North Island, San Diego, California. In 1912 the requirements and rank of Military Aviator were created for heavier-than-air aircraft pilots; the rank of Military Aeronaut was for lighter-than-air aircraft pilots. (Previous to this all American military pilots were certified by civilian aviation bodies). The first 24 certified pilots awarded this distinction (and the accompanying Signals Corps Military Aviator badge) were listed in War Department General Order No. 39 (27 May 1913). This was later split in 1914 into the ranks of Student Pilot (which granted a 25% increase in pay), Junior Military Aviator (for certified Enlisted Pilots and Lieutenants, granting a 50% increase in pay) and Military Aviator (for Captains and above; granting a 75% increase in pay but also requiring 3 years of flight experience). Junior Military Aviators who participated in regular and full- time flight would be paid at the next pay grade (e.g., Flight 2nd Lieutenants would be paid the same as a 1st Lieutenant). Reserve Military Aviators had a commission in the Army Reserves; this meant they had fewer billets, a slower career progression, and less job security than Regular Army pilots. 1917‚Äì18 To meet the increased demand for pilots, the Signal Corps Aviation School was shut down during World War I and its functions moved to other facilities. Rockwell Field was closed in 1920 and just used for storage. Student training was in three stages: #Ground School was created on 12 May 1917. Students were taught the basics of flight, airplane operation and maintenance, meteorology, astronomy, military science, and officer behavior. It lasted 8 weeks (extended to 12 in 1918) and took place at the U.S. Schools of Military Aeronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University, University of Texas, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, University of California at Berkeley, and Ohio State. #Preliminary Flight School was next. This was taught at flight centers across the country. Facilities included Selfridge Field, Michigan; Chanute and Scott Fields, Illinois; Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio; Kelly, Taliaferro, Love, Call, Rich, and Ellington Fields Texas; Post Field, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Gerstner Field, Louisiana. Cadets had about 40‚Äì50 flight hours in Curtiss JN-4 Jenny biplanes: 4‚Äì10 hours of dual training, 24 hours of solo flying, and a 16-hour cross- country flight. Graduates were certified as Reserve Military Aviators in the Army Signal Corps. #Advanced Flight Training took place in the United Kingdom, France, or Italy. Cadets were trained on their assigned aircraft for about 90 hours before being sent into combat in Europe. During World War I the rank of Junior Military Aviator was indicated by a US Shield with one wing. The rank of Military Aviator was indicated by a US shield flanked by a pair of wings. On 9 July 1918 the rank of Flying Cadet was created by act of Congress. 1919‚Äì21 Cadet training was in two stages. #Preliminary Training was for four months (combining Ground and Preliminary Flight School) and was held at Carlstrom Field, Florida or March Field, California. #Advanced Training was for three months. It was held at Post, Kelly, or Ellington Fields. 1922‚Äì26 The Air Service consolidated all its training at San Antonio, Texas in June 1922. This was to save money and provide good year-round flying conditions. #Primary Training was extended to five months at Brooks Field. #Advanced Training was extended to six months at Kelly Field. 1926‚Äì38 The Army Air Corps Act of 1926 set certain reforms as part of a five-year program to expand and improve the aviation arm of the Army. The U.S. Army Air Service would have its name changed to the U.S. Army Air Corps, to reflect its new role as a combatant military force. The post of \\"Assistant Secretary of War for Air\\" post was created to foster development of military aviation and an Aviation Section was added to each division of the Army General Staff. Around 90% of an aviation unit's officers had to receive pilot or observer rating and only flight-rated officers could command aviation units. The Air Corps Training Center was built at Duncan Field, near Kelly Field, in 1926. This was moved to Randolph Field on 1 October 1931. #Primary and Basic Training was extended to eight months each and was held at the Air Corps Training Center. #Advanced Training was reduced to four months and was held at Kelly Field. 1939‚Äì40 In 1938 the U.S. Army Air Corps was expanded to 24 groups by 1939. This required an influx of cadets to meet the requirements. There were three 12-week cycles (or about nine months total). #Primary Flight Training was performed by contracted civilian flight schools. #Basic Flight Training was performed at Randolph Field. #Advanced Flight Training was done at Kelly Field and Brooks Field. Aviation Cadet Program (USAAF), 1940‚Äì47=1940‚Äì41 Cadet flight training was reduced in 1940 to seven months of training and only 200 flight hours to meet a potential demand for military pilots. From 30 June 1940 to 30 June 1941 the US Army Air Corps tripled in size from 51,165 men (19.1% of the Army's total strength) to 152,125 men (10.4% of the Army's total strength).Army Air Forces Statistical Digest, Table 3: AAF MILITARY PERSONNEL - NUMBER AND PERCENT OF US ARMY STRENGTH: 1912 TO 1945, pg.15 (December 1945) 1941‚Äì47 On 20 June 1941, the air arm of the U.S. Army previously known as the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) became the \\"U.S. Army Air Forces\\" (USAAF). The grade of Aviation Cadet was created for pilot candidates and the program was renamed the Aviation Cadet Training Program (AvCad). Cadets were paid $75 a month ($50 base pay + $25 \\"flight pay\\") ‚Äì the same rate as Army Air Corps privates with flight status \\\\- and a uniform allowance of $150. As junior officers, cadets were addressed as \\"Mister\\" by all ranks. The program was expanded in May 1942 to also cover training navigators and bombardiers and Moffett Field became the first center to give \\"pre-flight\\" training to them. Other specialties covered included communications, armament, meteorology, and radar operation; they were conventional Army warrant officers who attended an appropriate USAAF warrant officer school. From May 1942 to 1947, aviation cadets wore the same uniform as Army officers, except they lacked the mohair cuffband of a full officer. The service cap differed in that it had a blue hatband (with olive drab uniform) or brown hatband (with Khaki uniform) and the general issue eagle was replaced by the winged propeller insignia of the Army Air Forces. The garrison cap was worn with the army Air Forces insignia on the left side. Rank stripes were light olive drab (brown) on a dark blue backing and were 3.125-inches wide on shirts and coats and 7.5-inches wide on overcoats. This created a problem because the new stripes were just being produced and the old stripes were becoming scarce. Therefore, in January 1943 the Army authorized training center commanders to procure commercially-made versions to meet demand. This led to non-standard designs (like dark blue or black chevrons on olive drab backings) and unique duty position insignias. The USAAF rank of flight officer was created by Public Law 658 (Flight Officer Act). Its insignia was similar to the warrant officer (junior grade) insignia except for the color of its enamel backing. It was in blue enamel for Air ratings (pilot, navigator, bombardier, Flight Engineer, or Fire Control Officer - graduates of the aviation cadet program) and brown enamel for Ground ratings (radar operator, armorer, meteorologist, etc. - graduates of the USAAF's warrant officer schools). Air ratings were promotable to second lieutenant and Ground ratings were promotable to chief warrant officer. Air ratings outranked Ground ratings. The warrant officer's bars were worn horizontally on the shoulder straps of the shirt or jacket, like a lieutenant's or captain's bars. Co-pilot Flight Officers - an Air rating - wore brown-enamel ground chief warrant officer insignia when flying. This was so they would not be confused with a pilot flight officer, the plane's commander. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into the war, the number of volunteers for pilot training was enormous. Fearing that they would lose them to the general draft, aviation cadet-applicants were given exemption from 1942 until the demand lessened in July, 1944. Demand for pilots meant that training had to be modified to accommodate the large numbers of pilot candidates. Training came in four stages (extended to five stages in April 1942 with the creation of the pre-flight stage). Classification lasted one week and the education and training stages were nine weeks each. Each 9-week stage was divided into two 4.5-week (63-day) halves: a lower half and an upper half . The lower half was made up of students just beginning the stage and the upper half was made up of the students who were half-finished. The more experienced cadets would hopefully help the new cadets get through the section before they were promoted to the next stage. *On-line Training was the term for busy work given to cadets when there were no open spaces in the next level. They did any unskilled menial task that needed doing until a billet opened up. * Classification stage processed the cadet and issued him his equipment. This was the stage where it would be decided whether the cadet would train as a navigator, bombardier, or pilot. Candidates who failed the testing or the advanced physical were returned to the regular Army. * Pre-flight stage was divided into two parts and was attended by pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. The first six weeks was a compressed \\"boot camp\\" that concentrated on athletics and military training. This was followed by four weeks of academics. They were taught the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass refresher courses in mathematics and physics. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. Cadets were evaluated for 10 hours in a crude flight simulator called a \\"blue box\\", then performed a harrowing \\"ride-along\\" with a pilot-instructor for an hour. Those that passed were given Cadet Wings and were promoted to Pilot School. =USAAF schools= Pilot School #Primary Pilot Training taught basic flight using two-seater training aircraft. This was usually done by contract schools (civilian pilot training schools) through the Civil Aeronautics Authority ‚Äì War Training Service (CAA-WTS). Cadets got around 60 to 65 flight hours in Stearman, Ryan, or Fairchild primary trainers before going to Basic.http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1649 National Museum of the USAF, \\"AAF Training: Primary Flying School\\" #Basic Pilot Training taught the cadets to fly in formation, fly by instruments or by aerial navigation, fly at night, and fly for long distances. Cadets got about 70 flight hours in BT-9 or BT-13 basic trainers before being promoted to Advanced Training.http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1491 National Museum of the USAF,\\"AAF Training: Basic Flying School,\\" #Advanced Pilot Training placed the graduates in two categories: single-engined and multi-engined. Single-engined pilots flew the AT-6 advanced trainer. Multi- engined pilots learned to fly the AT-9, AT-10, AT-11 or AT-17 advanced trainers.http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1477 National Museum of the USAF, \\"AAF Training: Advanced Flying School\\" Cadets were supposed to get a total of about 75 to 80 flight hours before graduating and getting their pilot's wings. #Transition Pilot Training Single-engined pilots transitioned to fighters and fighter-bombers and multi-engined pilots transitioned to transports or bombers. Pilots got two months of training before being sent into combat duty. Graduates were usually graded as flight officers (warrant officers). Cadets who graduated at the top of their class were graded as second lieutenants. Aviation cadets who washed out of pilot training were sent to navigator or bombardier school. Aviation cadets who washed out of navigator or bombardier training were usually sent to Flexible Gunnery School to become aerial gunners. Liaison Pilot School lasted 60 flight hours. It was an option for cadets who had passed primary training, but had washed out of basic or advanced training. They were trained to fly single- engined light aircraft similar to the light trainers they flew in Primary and were given training in takeoffs over obstacles, short-field landings, and low- altitude navigation. Their duties included transportation of troops and supplies, medical evacuation, aerial photography, and low-level reconnaissance. Graduates received liaison pilot wings. They were originally graded as flight staff sergeants until 1942, when they were graded as flight officers. Bombardier School lasted 18 weeks. It consisted of 425 hours of ground instruction in the proficiencies of a bombardier (plus familiarity with the tasks of the pilot, radioman, or navigator in case of an emergency). After 3 weeks this included 120 hours of air training in which the cadet began with practice runs and ended by performing bombing runs with live ordnance. Graduates received a bombardier's wings. Navigator School lasted 18 weeks. It consisted of 500 hours of ground instruction in the duties of a navigator (charting, directional bearings, computed headings, airspeed, radio codes, celestial navigation, etc.). This was combined with familiarity with the tasks of a pilot or radioman in case of emergency. After four weeks the cadet acted as a navigator in day and night flights in Advanced Navigator trainers like the AT-7 Navigator or AT-11A Kansan. Graduates received a navigator's wings. Radio Operator School lasted 18 weeks and was run by the U.S. Army Signals Corps. Graduates received the rank of Sergeant, with the top percentage receiving the rank of Staff Sergeant. They wore the Army Air Corps insignia. There was no official Radio Operator's wings - there were many tailor-made ones cast or made from regular wings by jewelers or embroidered on cloth. Flexible Gunnery School was a six-week program that taught the cadet how to man a flexible-mount machinegun or a powered turret. All aircrew had to attend gunnery school in case of emergencies and had to qualify before they could join an aircrew. Bombardiers and navigators attended either before or after they attended their training school. Aviation Cadet Training (USAF), 1947 - 1961/1965 In September 1947, the U.S. Army Air Forces became a separate and independent service, renamed the United States Air Force (USAF). At the time, the newly created Air Force had no service academy of its own yet (the USMA and USNA had options for their cadets and midshipmen, respectively, to become USAF officers). Separate Air Force ROTC and Officer Candidate School (later retitled Officer Training School) programs were still being established. The Aviation Cadet Training Program continued to remain as a principal source of the Air Force's pilots and navigators and they wore the same basic uniform as Air Force officers. 1952‚Äì1961 In 1952, the Air Training Command (ATC) implemented a four-phase pilot training program: pre-flight, primary, basic, and advanced / crew. *Pre-Flight weeded out unfit applicants and sorted candidates into pilot, navigator, and other aircrew categories. Pilots *Primary Training had pilots fly T-6 Texans for about 130 hours, soloing for 20 to 25 hours. In the mid-1950s, the T-6 was replaced by the T-34A Mentor. *Basic Training had pilots fly T-28 Trojans for 55 hours. *Advanced Training had pilots destined for fighter aircraft flying jet trainers like the T-33 Shooting Star for 75 hours; pilots destined for large multiengine bomber, tanker/transport or reconnaissance aircraft flew a similar number of hours in the TB-25 Mitchell, while helicopter pilots would follow a similar track in training helicopters of various types. In the final two years of the program, all fixed-wing pilots merged into a single training track flying the T-37 Tweet and T-38 Talon as the T-6, T-34, T-28 and T-33 were phased out of the ATC inventory. Navigators Navigator training of the period commenced in the TC-45 Expeditor or TB-25 Mitchell, followed by transition to the T-29 Flying Classroom, although by the late 1950s, all aircrew training had been consolidated in the T-29. Navigator training for Aviation Cadets was merged with that for commissioned officers and conducted at James Connally AFB, Texas; Harlingen AFB, Texas; Ellington AFB, Texas and Mather AFB, California. Follow-on training qualified some of these navigators in additional fields, such as radar navigator/bombardier, electronic warfare officer or radar intercept officer. End of AvCad The USAF Aviation Cadet program ended for pilots in 1961 and navigators in 1965. In 1960, the Air Force implemented the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) concept. From now on the United States Air Force Academy (started in the fall semester of 1959), The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, and the Air Force Officer Training School were to provide all of its pilots and navigators. =Last Aviation Cadet Pilot= The last Aviation Cadet pilot classes were Webb AFB class 61G and Reese AFB class 62A. The last Aviation Cadet pilot to graduate was 2nd Lieutenant William F. Wesson, the only member of Reese AFB class 62B-2, on 11 October 1961. Wesson was originally a member of class 62A but was injured during a training accident and had to recover and requalify before he could graduate. =Last Aviation Cadet Navigator= The last Aviation Cadet navigator class was 65‚Äì15 at James Connally AFB. It was made up of Eulalio Arzaga, Jr., James J. Crowling, Jr., Ronald M. Durgee, Harry W. Elliott, Timothy J. Geary, Robert E. Girvan, Glen D. Green, Paul J. Gringot, Jr., William P. Hagopian, Steven V. Harper, Robert D. Humphrey, Hollis D. Jones, Evert F. Larson, Gerald J. Lawrence, Thomas J. Mitchell, Ronald W. Oberender, Raymond E. Powell, Victor B. Putz, Milton Spivack, Donald E. Templeman, and Herbert F. Turney. These aviation cadets became USAF 2nd lieutenants. and were awarded their navigator wings on 3 March 1965. Class 65-15 chose classmate Cadet Steven V. Harper of Miami, Florida, for the honor of \\"Last Aviation Cadet\\" based on his high academic, military, and flying grades. =Last Aviation Cadet in USAF Service= On 1 November 2002 Lt Gen. Russell C. Davis retired after 44 years of service (5 years in the Air Force and 39 years in the Air National Guard). He was the first Black USAF officer to reach the rank of Brigadier General and was the first Black general officer to command the National Guard Bureau (1998-2002).

CPP/CPR Techniques CPP and CPR techniques include slab stabilization, full- and partial-depth repair, dowel bar retrofit, cross stitching longitudinal cracks or joints, diamond grinding and joint and crack resealing. CPP and CPR methods, developed over the last 40 years, are used in lieu of asphalt overlays and bituminous patches to repair roads when longer lasting solutions are desired. When installing pavers over top of an existing asphalt of concrete pad, there are three installation options: sand set, bituminous set, and mortar set. Due to rising oil prices, these methods are often less expensive than an asphalt overlay and last three times longer in addition to providing a greener, more sustainable solution. Minnesota DOT AirportBiz.Com Saturday, 12 October 2019 A recent study was conducted that shows that diamond grinding is an effective means of extending the service life of concrete by imparting a smooth pavement surface with desirable surface texture. The process can also be used to address faulting at joints or cracks, roughness, polished concrete surfaces exhibiting inadequate macrotexure, wheel path rutting, unacceptable noise levels, permanent upward slab warping and inadequate transverse slopes. The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS), a pioneer in the use of diamond grinding to preserve their concrete roadways, has determined that the average age of a diamond ground surface in California is between 16 and 17 years, and a pavement can be diamond ground up to three times.CALTRANSRoads & Bridges Dowel bar retrofit (DBR) is a process that re-establishes load transfer capability on joints and cracks by installing epoxy-coated, round steel dowels into existing concrete pavement across transverse joints and/or cracks. Slots are cut using diamond-tipped saw blades; the existing concrete is removed and the dowels are placed in the slots across the joints or cracks. The slots are then backfilled with a non-shrink grout and the pavement is diamond ground to restore smoothness. The diamond grinding removes excess grout and any displacement of panels. The entire road is often diamond ground to remove bumps or dips and provide a safe, quiet riding surface. In Wisconsin, researchers found that the overall accident rate for diamond ground surfaces was only 60 percent of the rate for the non-ground surfaces.CALTRANSBetter Roads IGGA IGGA Fast full-depth pavement repair: To open a pavement to traffic quickly, it takes more than just fast-setting concrete.

He made a collection of 32 tracks with this unique material and named it, Chinoiseries, an album that blends Hip-Hop and Chinese Pop Music influences. In 2008, he was selected to attend the Red Bull Music Academy in Barcelona and shortly after, started touring all across Europe, USA, Asia and Australia. In 2010, Onra released his latest LP Long Distance on All City Records.

They are the largest and oldest player in the fight against leprosy and are working towards the goal of zero leprosy transmission by 2035. Their vision is 'leprosy defeated, lives transformed'. As well as working towards zero leprosy transmission, The Leprosy Mission is committed to achieving zero disabilities as a consequence of leprosy and zero discrimination as a consequence of leprosy. History In December 1869, Wellesley Bailey, a young Irishman who was working as a teacher in the Punjab in India, came across a row of huts inhabited by men and women with serious disabilities and physical deformities. A colleague explained that they were suffering from leprosy. Bailey was shocked by what he saw. Afterwards he wrote:'I almost shuddered, yet I was at the same time fascinated, and I felt that if there was ever a Christlike work in the world it was to go amongst these poor sufferers and bring them the consolation of the gospel.' On returning to Ireland in 1874, Wellesley Bailey and his wife Alice began to hold meetings in Dublin to tell friends about their experiences of people affected by leprosy in India, and to raise money'. And so The Leprosy Mission, or The Mission to 'Lepers' as it was known then, was born.An Inn Called Welcome: The story of the Mission to Lepers 1874-1917, A. Donald Miller, 1965 1874-1893 ‚Äì The Baileys travel extensively in India to see the need of people affected by leprosy and to encourage support work. 1891 ‚Äì Wellesley Bailey visits Mandalay, Burma, to open the first TLM home for leprosy-affected people outside India. 1917 ‚Äì The Mission has extended its work throughout India and the Far East and now has 87 programmes in 12 countries, with support offices in eight countries. 1940s ‚Äì In South India, Paul Brand pioneers medical research and reconstructive surgery on leprosy deformities in hands and feet.Ten Fingers for God, Dorothy Clarke Wilson, Hodder and Stoughton, 1965 1940s-50s ‚Äì The first effective cure for leprosy, Dapsone, is introduced. Over the next 15 years, millions of patients are successfully treated. 1950s ‚Äì The Mission‚Äôs work is extended into Africa. 1954 ‚Äì World Leprosy Day is founded by Raoul Follereau, a French writer, to make sure that people everywhere know that leprosy still exists and is completely curable. It is usually held each year on the last Sunday in January. 1960s ‚Äì Leprologists work to discover new drugs that are effective against leprosy as many people are discovered to have Dapsone-resistant leprosy. 1965 ‚Äì The Mission changes its name from 'The Mission to Lepers' to the Leprosy Mission to avoid the negative connotations of the word ‚Äòleper.‚Äô 1970s ‚Äì TLM begins to extend its work to people's homes and communities, rather than just hospitals and asylums. 1980 ‚Äì Vincent Barry and his team win the 1980 UNESCO Science Prize for their discovery of anti-leprosy drug clofazimine, developed with the assistance of The Leprosy Mission. 1981 ‚Äì World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a new combination drug treatment for leprosy, MDT (Multi Drug Therapy). People are cured in as little as six months. 1990s ‚Äì As many more people are cured, caring for people with lasting disabilities through social, economic, and physical rehabilitation becomes increasingly important. 2011 ‚Äì The Leprosy Mission moves away from a centrally-directed regional structure and reformulates as a more decentralised Global Fellowship, who signed the TLM Charter (see below, under 'Where The Leprosy Mission works'. 2017 ‚Äì An ambitious new goal is set: to see no new cases of leprosy by 2035. This goal was agreed by the Members of TLM's Global Fellowship. 2019 ‚Äì A new global strategy is launched with 3 priorities: 1) Zero leprosy transmission by 2035; 2) Towards zero leprosy disability; 3) Towards zero leprosy discrimination Where The Leprosy Mission works The Leprosy Mission works through a Global Fellowship, composed of Members and Affiliates from 30 different countries. Members: Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Chad, DR Congo, Denmark, England & Wales, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Sudan, and Timor Leste Affiliates: Finland and Italy The Fellowship came into being in 2011 when The Leprosy Mission Charter was signed. This charter committed all signees to: * A shared identity, vision, purpose, and values * Work together in mutual reliance * Actively add value to the total Fellowship and strengthen its effectiveness * Work with agreed accountability structures * Observe financial stewardship principles The Members of the Global Fellowship are split into countries that implement leprosy work and countries that support leprosy work through fundraising. The Leprosy Mission's Global Fellowship is supported by an International Office in London, UK. This office operates as a central hub, providing leadership, co-ordination, facilitation, and operational services. The Leprosy Mission also works through partners in Tanzania, Sri Lnka, Indonesia, and Thailand. What The Leprosy Mission does=Hospitals and healthcare The Leprosy Mission owns 14 hospitals in India, one in Bangladesh, and one in Nepal. These hospitals are centres of excellence and provide an exceptional level of care to leprosy patients, as well as meeting the medical needs of the surrounding communities. These hospitals provide reconstructive surgery, physiotherapy, assistive devices, and special footwear. They also treat ulcers and leprosy reactions, providing counselling and mental health support, and health education. All of this is designed to enable people affected by leprosy to live independent and productive lives. They also support a number of hospitals in Asia and Africa that are owned by the government or local church. The Leprosy Mission also supports leprosy control activities across many of the countries in which they work. Leprosy is a curable disease and if cases can be diagnosed and treated early enough, the disabilities associated with leprosy can be avoided. Training and education Leprosy is found predominantly in countries where poverty is widespread. To help prevent poverty amongst the leprosy community, The Leprosy Mission provides training and education to people affected by leprosy. For school-age children, The Leprosy Mission provides support to help them to stay in school and finish their school education. For adults, The Leprosy Mission offers vocational training, which includes, for examples, training in mechanics, computers, agriculture, and printing. Community Based Rehabilitation People affected by leprosy are often ostracised by their communities, which prevents them from being able to participate in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live. To tackle this issue, The Leprosy Mission supports community based rehabilitation programmes across Asia and Africa. This works includes promoting inclusive development, skills training, micro-finance, self-help groups, low-cost housing, self-care groups, and supporting Disabled People's Organisations. Through this kind of holistic care, people affected by leprosy are not just cured of leprosy, but are also given a chance to live full lives as a part of their communities. Advocacy The Leprosy Mission advocates for the rights of people affected by leprosy and aims to reduce the physical and social barriers that they face. They also work to promote advocacy training for people affected by leprosy so that they can self-advocate. This training ensures that people affected by leprosy know their rights and have the self- confidence to lobby for change at the local and national governmental levels. The Leprosy Mission has been working with the United Nations to ensure that governments are under pressure to protect the rights of people affected by leprosy. This advocacy is based on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). At the national level, The Leprosy Mission works with national governments to ensure that leprosy receives the appropriate time, attention, and resources. The Leprosy Mission have also been focused on ensuring that all laws that explicitly discriminate against people affected by leprosy across the world are repealed.  Research  The Leprosy Mission conducts research into leprosy that can help to answer many unanswered questions. This includes work to prevent the spread of leprosy, to prevent and treat leprosy reaction, and to understand why some people encounter severe nerve damage despite good treatment. The research is conducted in the Mycobacterial Research Laboratory in Anandaban Hospital, Nepal, at the Rural Health Programme, Nilphamari, Bangladesh and at the Stanley Browne Laboratory in New Delhi, India.

The surface is rendered somewhat rough by relatively fine, close-set and irregular spiral lines. There is no longitudinal sculpture except lines of growth. The species are large and ponderous, and include Megasurcula carpenteriana (Gabb, 1865) and Surcula tryoni Gabb 1865, from the coast of California. Megasurcula is a widely isolated and strongly characterized genus, belonging exclusively to the living fauna of the Pacific coast of North America as far as known at present. It is, at the same time, a rather direct descendant of the extinct Bathytoma, but the species are of far larger size, carpenteriana being probably the largest or most ponderous Pleurotomid known. The embryo, which is conoidal and multispiral in Bathytoma, has gradually lost some of its whorls, as shown in Megasurcula, which of itself would not be a generic character, but there is in Bathytoma a broad constriction of the body whorl below the convexity, forming a short stout beak, which is wholly unobservable in Megasurcula, and the aperture is much more capacious in the latter, with the anal sinus much larger and different in form and position.Casey T.L.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.  History  During World War II, the African- American population in Detroit ballooned to 300,000 residents.State of Michigan historic marker from the state of Michigan, retrieved 1/18/10 However, blacks were restricted in where they could live due to housing covenants, overpriced rent, and other forms of discrimination. To alleviate the shortage of housing space, Julius and William Schwartz platted the Annapolis Park suburb in what was then Nankin Township and is now Westland, specifically for African-Americans. The neighborhood was platted in three sections: one in 1953, one in 1954, and one in 1955. A fourth Annapolis Park platting, in 1961, is not included in the Historic District. When local banks proved reluctant to provide mortgages to prospective home owners, the Schwartzes also established the Franklin Mortgage Company to make loans to residents. Annapolis Park was quickly successful, with the first two houses constructed in 1953, 134 more built in 1954, 168 more during 1955, and 51 houses built in 1956/57, completely filling the subdivision. It is likely that a substantial percentage of the original homeowners were World War II veterans who used the mortgage guarantee provisions of the GI Bill to purchase their house. Sales were apparently mostly by word of mouth, but the availability of adequate financing and the efforts of part-time salesmen Jimmy Nelms (the first African American male school teacher in the Wayne school system) Levi Jackson (a former Yale football captain) boosted sales. Annapolis Park residents formed the Southeast Homeowners Association (now the Southeast Westland Homeowners Association) in 1955 to promote community unity. In 1966, the city of Westland was incorporated from the remainder of the former Nankin Township, and Annapolis Park was included. Today's Annapolis Park is an attractive, well-cared-for neighborhood, which includes many descendants of the first homeowners. Description Annapolis Park contains 354 houses situated along a series of curved streets. The houses are ranch houses, primarily with brick exteriors, and all constructed in 1953-57. Lots are roughly 50‚Äì60 feet wide and 110‚Äì140 feet deep, and typically slightly irregular due to the curved streets. Although the houses are of uniform size and placement, the curving streets and variations in rooflines gives a pleasing visual character to the neighborhood. The streets are paved, with parallel sidewalks and a grass berm between. During the original construction, maples were planted on the berm at each lot; substantial numbers survive. The entire neighborhood is located on a roughly L-shaped, nearly level site, and is surrounded by similar residential subdivisions, some constructed around the same time and some of more modern vintage. The district contains a single brick bungalow, at the southwest comer of Middlebelt and Hanover, that was constructed before the neighborhood was platted. The remainder of the district consists of one-story two or three-bedroom ranch houses, either hopped roof or side gabled. A small percentage of the neighborhood, primarily the first houses built, are clad with siding, but the vast majority are brick. Brick veneers are typically of red brick, but orange-red, buff, and grayish brick were also used. Stone veneer or brick of a different hue is incorporated in many houses on the front above window-sill level and in decorative panels. Most houses have detached garages located at the back end of the lot.

Robertson made a substantial contribution to education in Donegal, in that, his legacy to the Diocese of Raphoe contributed to the transition between the outdoor hedge school and the indoor-based education provided by the national school system. A number of schools in County Donegal received were supported by the fund. History By 1858, the Commissioners of EducationReport of Her Majesty's Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Endownments, Funds and Actual Condition of all Schools Endowed for the Purposes of education in Ireland, 1858 and others were of the opinion that the legacy was hindering the development of education in the schools contributed to. Colonel Robertson's will of 25 of December 1790, bequeathed a sum of money, out of the interest of which, ¬£15 per annum was to be paid to each of the parishes in the diocese of Raphoe, in the 19th century, for the support of a school-master to instruct children of all religious denominations. This fund increased and enabled the trustees to grant ¬£40 to each parish, for the erection of a school-house, provided an acre of land on a perpetually renewable lease be obtained for a site. According to the Thirteenth Report of the Commissioners for enquiring into the State of all Schools on Public or Charitable Foundations in Ireland (March 1812): > \\"There is in the Diocese of Raphoe a very munificent Endowment for the > education of the Children of the lower orders of the people, established > under the last Will and Testament of the late Colonel Robertson, who in the > year 1790, by his last Will and Testament dated 25 September in that year, > did among other Bequests therein mentioned make the following:- \\"I give and > devise to the Parishes of the Diocese of Raphoe a sum of money, which by its > interest at the rate of five per cent shall be found sufficient to produce > fifteen pounds sterling annually to each Parish, for or towards establishing > a School therein, and purchasing books, as well of entertainment as of > instruction, in every Parish of said Diocese; and it is to be understood, > that such as in said Parishes may not be of the Established Religion, are > notwithstanding to share equally in this Legacy, which it is to be hoped > will contribute to their conformation with the English church, by > enlightening their understandings; and I do appoint the Lord Primate of > Ireland, the lord Archbishop of Dublin, the Lord Bishop, Dean, Archdeacon > and Rectors of said Diocese for the time being, to be Trustees herein for > said Parishes, with a power to form such regulations in the founding and > conducting of said Schools aforesaid as may seem best to them; and to > dispose of, in the purchase of Lands of Inheritance in fee simple, or to put > to interest on good security in Ireland, the aforesaid sum of money.\\" Decree of 1803 In the 'Thirteenth Report of the Commissioners for enquiring into the State of all Schools on Public or Charitable Foundations in Ireland', 18 March 1812 it was recorded that: > On Monday the 7th day of March, 1803, the Right honourable the Lord > Chancellor of Ireland, Lord Redesdale, was pleased to pronounce the > following Decree respecting said Charitable Bequest. DECREE: It is ordered, > adjudged and decreed by the Right honourable the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, > that the Bequests in the Testator's Will to the Parishes of the Diocese of > Raphoe, of a sum of money, which by its Interest, at the rate of five pounds > per cent, shall be found sufficient to produce 15 pounds sterling annually > to each Parish, ought to be considered as a Bequest of 300 pounds sterling > for the benefit of each Parish; and it appearing that there are 31 Parishes > in said Diocese, it is further ordered that the said Bequest ought to be > Deemed and is hereby decreed as a Bequest of the sum of nine thousand three > hundred pounds sterling, payable within one year after the death of the > Testator.\\" In 1858, the Commissioners of Education inspected the schools and found that the Fund had become a hindrance to the development of education. It was observed that \\"when the entire support of the master is thrown on the endowment by the rector of the parish, the bequest of Colonel Robertson becomes an evil rather than a benefit, as, by superseding all other support, it introduces a starveling, useless school. With some exceptions, the diocese of Raphoe would have been provided with parochial schools of a better class if the endowment had never been made.\\" Colonel Robertson's fund supported in the order of one hundred schools in Donegal in the 19th century. Today, there are a number of schools that carry the name Robertson in Donegal. For example, Robertson National School, Ballintra and Robertson National School, Lifford.

History The network consisted of Chiltern Radio 97.6/96.9, Oasis Radio, Northants Radio, Horizon Radio, Severn Sound and Galaxy 97.2 who all used the name Hot FM after their original station name. Stations would broadcast from their own studios until 7pm, then share programmes from Dunstable overnight. In 1994, the shareholders were approached by the GWR group who were prepared to pay over 20 times the company's turnover in order to acquire the company. Following the Government's relaxation of ownership rules from 20 to 35 stations, the acquisition took place in 1995 and The Hot FM was no more. Presenters Networked presenters included Chris Moyles (who joined in The Hot FM's dying days), Emma Scott, Steve Power, Tim Allen, Simon Clarke, Neale James, Treva Ellis, NJ Williams and Laura Penn. Other presenters included Paul Garner who did a comedy and unsigned music show, David Francis on the late show and Dave Sanders who hosted a Sunday show consisting of mostly album tracks. Following GWR's takeover Chris Moyles was moved to a late night slot before eventually being axed in favour of the already established GWR presenter, Graham Torrington and his \\"Late Night Love\\", although by this time The Hot FM branding had long gone.

The phrase means that an extreme case is a poor basis for a general law that would cover a wider range of less extreme cases. In other words, a general law is better drafted for the average circumstance as this will be more common. The original meaning of the phrase concerned cases in which the law had a hard impact on some person whose situation aroused sympathy. The expression dates at least to 1837. It was used in 1904 by US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Its validity has since been questioned and dissenting variations include the phrase \\"Bad law makes hard cases\\", and even its opposite, \\"Hard cases make good law\\". Discussion The maxim dates at least to 1837, when a judge, ruling in favor of a parent against the maintenance of her children, said, \\"We have heard that hard cases make bad law.\\"Hodgens v. Hodgens (1837), quoted in Fred Shapiro, The Yale Book of Quotations (2006). The judge's wording suggests that the phrase was not new then. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made a utilitarian argument for this in his judgment of Northern Securities Co. v. United States (1904): Holmes's dissenting opinion in the case, which applied the Sherman Antitrust Act to the securities company, has been described as a reaction to President Theodore Roosevelt's wish to dramatize the issues of monopolies and trusts. The legal scholar Glanville Williams questioned the adage's usage in 1957, writing, \\"It used to be said that 'hard cases make bad law'‚Äîa proposition that our less pedantic age regards as doubtful. What is certain is that cases in which the moral indignation of the judge is aroused frequently make bad law.\\" Bryan A. Garner calls the phrase a cliche; while mentioning Williams's disparagement, he asserts that it remains in frequent use, \\"sometimes unmeaningfully\\". In Re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2), Lord Denning stated the following, after one of the barristers in the case had asserted that the issues should be resolved in his client's favour, given that \\"hard cases make bad law\\": Bad law makes hard cases The adage's converse, \\"bad law makes hard cases\\", has also been used. In his discussion of the converse, the jurist John Chipman Gray saw legal professionals as subject to the temptation of valuing the \\"logical coherency of the system itself\\" over the well-being of individuals. A more recent discussion of the adage and its converse sees cases that have received special attention as the recipient of more care. Hard cases make good law The legal scholar Arthur Linton Corbin, writing in 1923, reversed the adage in an article entitled \\"Hard Cases Make Good Law\\": See also * Exception that proves the rule * Special pleading References Category:Adages Category:Quotations from law Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 19th century Category:English legal terminology ","title":"Hard cases make bad law"},{"id":"25879104","text":"William Preston Burch (1846 - July 9, 1926) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing Hall of Fame trainer. A native of South Carolina, William Burch served as a courier in the Confederate States Army under Lieut. Gen. Wade Hampton III during the American Civil War. At war's end he became involved in the racing of American Quarter Horses at various fairgrounds in the Southern United States. In 1866 he embarked on a career as a professional trainer in Thoroughbred horse racing which led him to work at racetracks along the northeastern seaboard where for many years he owned, trained and raced horses for himself. Among those were Biggonet, who won important races at New York tracks including the 1885 Spinaway Stakes at Saratoga Race Course and the 1886 Withers Stakes at Jerome Park Racetrack. Beginning in the early 1890s Burch conditioned horses for owners such as Francis Hitchcock, Samuel Ross, and Admiral Cary Grayson. While preparing horses for owners Cary Grayson and Samuel Ross at Saratoga Springs, New York in July 1926, eighty-year-old William Burch fell ill and was admitted to a private hospital where he died on July 9. Following its formation, in 1955 William P. Burch was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Individuality (or self-hood) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing their own needs or goals, rights and responsibilities. The concept of an individual features in diverse fields, including biology, law, and philosophy.  Etymology  From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics) individual meant \\"indivisible\\", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning \\"a person\\". From the 17th century on, individual has indicated separateness, as in individualism.Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26‚Äì27  Law  Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a sane adult human being is usually considered by the state as an \\"individual person\\" in law, even if the person denies individual culpability (\\"I followed instructions\\"). An individual person is accountable for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to prosecution in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached age of majority, often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of voting rights, responsibility for paying tax, military duties, and the individual right to bear arms (protected only under certain constitutions). Philosophy Individuals may stand out from the crowd, or may blend in with it. Buddhism In Buddhism, the concept of the individual lies in anatman, or \\"no-self.\\" According to anatman, the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that, working together, give the appearance of being a single, separated whole. In this way, anatman, together with anicca, resembles a kind of bundle theory. Instead of an atomic, indivisible self distinct from reality, the individual in Buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing, impermanent universe (see Interdependence, Nondualism, Reciprocity). Empiricism Early empiricists such as Ibn TufailG. A. Russell (1994), The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England, pp. 224‚Äì62, Brill Publishers, . in early 12th century Islamic Spain, and John Locke in late 17th century England, introduced the idea of the individual as a tabula rasa (\\"blank slate\\"), shaped from birth by experience and education. This ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual, society as a social contract between rational individuals, and the beginnings of individualism as a doctrine. Hegel Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel regarded history as the gradual evolution of Mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world. Each time the mind applies its concepts to the world, the concept is revealed to be only partly true, within a certain context; thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). The individual comes to rise above their own particular viewpoint, and grasps that they are a part of a greater whole insofar as they are bound to family, a social context, and/or a political order. Existentialism With the rise of existentialism, S√∏ren Kierkegaard rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose their own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion. Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of the will to power and the heroic ideal of the √úbermensch. The individual is also central to Sartre's philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and free will. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in Nikolai Berdyaev), the individual is called upon to create their own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality. Objectivism Ayn Rand's Objectivism regards every human as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to their own life, a right derived from their nature as a rational being. Individualism and Objectivism hold that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights ‚Äî and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. Since only an individual man or woman can possess rights, the expression \\"individual rights\\" is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in today's intellectual chaos), but the expression \\"collective rights\\" is a contradiction in terms. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual).Ayn Rand, \\"Individualism\\". Ayn Rand Lexicon.Ayn Rand (1961), \\"Individual Rights\\". Ayn Rand Lexicon. Biology In biology, the question of the individual is related to the definition of an organism, which is an important question in biology and philosophy of biology, despite there having been little work devoted explicitly to this question. An individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a \\"unit of selection\\". Genes, genomes, or groups may function as individual units. Asexual reproduction occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical. Such a colony is called a genet, and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. The colony, rather than the individual, functions as a unit of selection. In other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of sexual reproduction. See alsoReferencesFurther reading * Gracie, Jorge J. E.

Clouston qualified M.D.(Edinburgh) with a thesis on the nervous system of the lobster, supervised by John Goodsir. His early interest in insanity resulted in an apprenticeship with David Skae, the eminent Superintendent of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. In 1863, Clouston was appointed superintendent of the Cumberland and Westmoreland Asylum (Garlands Hospital) in Carlisle; and in 1873, in succession to Skae, Superintendent of the new Royal Edinburgh Asylum, which had been set up under new principles laid down by the then Commissioner to the Scottish Health Board, Sir James Coxe . In 1879, after having lectured for some years in conjunction with the Professor of the Practice of Physics Thomas Laycock, Clouston was appointed as the first ever Lecturer on Mental Diseases in the University of Edinburgh, a post which he held in conjunction with his position at the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. Clouston became a celebrated lecturer with an international reputation for his exposition of the psychiatric disorders of adolescence. Clouston published extensively, beginning with his remarkable Clinical Lectures on Mental Diseases (1883), followed, much later, by his more popular work Unsoundness of Mind (1911). Another book aimed at the general public was entitled Morals and The Brain; and he remained an unreconstructed believer in \\"masturbational insanity\\" and an uncompromising advocate of teetotalism in opposition to his exact contemporary, the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne. In 1888, Clouston served as President of the Medico-Psychological Association. In 1875, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers were Sir Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister, John Hutton Balfour, Sir William Turner and Alexander Crum Brown.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf In 1894 he opened the Craig House extension to the Royal Edinburgh asylum on Easter Craiglockhart Hill, which was renamed the Thomas Clouston Clinic in 1972. The buildings later became part of Napier University. From 1902 to 1904 he was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Clouston retired in 1908 and was knighted in 1911.

The Faction became a registered charity in 2011. Their first production was Richard III at the Brockley Jack Theatre, London, in October 2008. The Faction is now led by two artistic directors; Mark Leipacher and Rachel Valentine Smith, and is supported by a core ensemble of eleven actors and associate artists.

They were then invited to be an associate ensemble of the New Diorama Theatre. With the support of their 5-year relationship at The New Diorama, The Faction was able to trial a more permanent model of working in repertory theatre, with a core ensemble. Since 2012, The Faction have produced five annual sell-out repertory seasons, engaging with over 26,000 audience members and 4,000 students. In 2016, The Faction partnered with Selfridges to create an auditorium in their Oxford Street store for Shakespeare 400 celebrations, where they produced a version of Much Ado About Nothing to critical acclaim. The Faction took their work even further afield later that year, in partnership with the British Council, and the American University of Beirut, producing and co-directing an Arabic premiere production of King Lear. In addition to Shakespeare, The Faction have produced work by other classic writers such Cervantes, Euripedes, Gorky, Lorca and Schiller. They also bridge the divide between classics and new writing by engaging some of the UK's most exciting and emerging writers. To date, this has included Ranjit Bolt (Three Sisters), Gareth Jandrell (Thebes, published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama), Emily Juniper (Miss Julie and Vassa Zheleznova) and two unique projects: Reptember and Demetrius. Reptember is an Off West End award-nominated project, consisting of 12 classic texts adapted for solo performance by some of our most promising playwrights, including Jessica Sian and Will Gore. Demetrius is an ongoing portmanteau project to complete Schiller's final unfinished work. Established writers such as April de Angelis, Glyn Maxwell and Simon Reade complete a \\"unit\\" before passing the baton to up and coming writers like Jon Brittain and Daniel Kanaber.

In his later years, he was influenced by the Art Nouveau movement. Biography Fujishima was born to an ex-samurai class household in Kagoshima, Satsuma Domain in southern Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, where his father had been a retainer of the Shimazu clan daimy≈ç. After studying art at Kagoshima Middle School he left home in 1884 to pursue his studies in Tokyo, first with Kawabata Gyokusho, a Shij≈ç school nihonga artist. However, Fujishima was attracted to the new western-style oil painting techniques, and switched to y≈çga-style painting, which he learned under Yamamoto H≈çsui and Soyama Yukihiro. His graduation piece, ‚ÄúCruelty‚Äù was exhibited at the 3rd Meiji Art Association Exhibition in 1891, where it was viewed by noted novelist and art critic Mori ≈ågai. Fujishima moved to Tsu in Mie Prefecture in 1893, where he was an assistant teacher at the Mie Prefectural Elementary School, but soon returned to Tokyo in 1896 under the sponsorship of Kuroda Seiki to become an assistant professor at the Tokyo Art School's Western Painting Department. He also joined Kuroda‚Äôs art coterie, the Hakubakai (White Horse Society). Travelling to France in 1905, Fujishima studied the techniques of historical painting under Fernand Cormon at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and portraiture under Carolus-Duran at the French Academy in Rome in Italy. He returned to Japan in 1910 and became a professor at the Tokyo Art School and a member of the Imperial Art Academy. In 1937, he was one of the first recipients of the newly created Order of Culture of the Japanese government. Fujishima died in 1943; his grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery, in Tokyo.

The Festival Grec de Barcelona (or Grec Festival of Barcelona) is an international theatre, dance, music and circus festival. Over the course of its history, this long-standing event has become a major summer attraction in Barcelona. Overview The festival takes its name from its main venue: an open-air theatre (the Teatre Grec) built on Mount Montju√Øc for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. At first, this ‚ÄúGreek Theatre‚Äù was the only venue used for festival productions, but, today, the Grec programme embraces many other theatres, cultural over the city of Barcelona. The Grec Festival is promoted by Barcelona City Council, but no other public administrations are involved; rather, the shows are organised and produced by a large number of theatres and promoters. The main sources of income for the festival are public grants, sponsorship and ticket sales. In 2010, a total of 101,181 tickets were sold for the events on the programme. The festival pursues a two-fold mission: firstly, to stage the most outstanding works by Catalan artists and companies, providing them with support by producing their shows for performance at the festival; and, secondly, to present all the most interesting shows from Spain and the rest of the world every year. Indeed, the Grec Festival is Catalonia‚Äôs main showcase for works produced abroad, and in recent years the organisers have been keen to internationalise the event even further, focusing on presenting the most innovative pieces from such countries as the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and France. Brief history In the years leading up to the restoration of democracy in Spain, the Barcelona theatre scene witnessed the birth of an innovative, independent approach to the performing arts, a movement that broke radically with the more conventional fare that had dominated the listings in the city until that time. The key figures in this alternative scene were, precisely, those that, in 1976, set up the Assembly of Actors and Directors. This Assembly was able, in just a few weeks, to programme a summer theatre season at the Teatre Grec in Montju√Øc. Nearly 47 years after its inauguration, Barcelona‚Äôs little-used ‚ÄúGreek Theatre‚Äù had fallen into a semi-abandoned state. Besides setting an example in self-management, the first Grec Festival both salvaged the theatre in Montju√Øc and achieved considerable public success. For the first two seasons, then, the Assembly of Actors and Directors organised the Grec Festival. The event did not take place in 1978 but, following the first democratic elections after the end of Francoist Spain (1979), Barcelona City Council took over the task of organising the festival. From that moment, the Grec became increasingly consolidated and enjoyed constant growth. In 1980, the programme was opened up to include productions from other countries, and this aspect of the Festival has been strengthened in recent years until now, along with support for local artists and productions, this international dimension is one of its essential characteristics. Over the course of its history, moreover, the Grec programme has gradually occupied more and more venues and spaces, spreading to different areas of the city and supporting the work of alternative theatres and companies whilst always maintaining a balance between initiatives of this type and shows aimed at broader audiences. Moreover, the organisers have long worked in close cooperation with the private sector. The latest stage in the Festival‚Äôs history has been marked by a clear interest in emerging, innovative art and the search for new audiences, as well as a firm commitment to dance and the circus (besides the usual programme of theatre and music) and to internationalisation, a focus that helps to bring the most interesting new productions from a particular country to the attention of Barcelona audiences every year. The Grec Festival of Barcelona has staged countless productions that now form part of the city‚Äôs theatre history, many featuring world-famous writers, directors and performers: from Dario Fo to Lindsay Kemp, Pina Bausch, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, the Martha Graham Dance Company, Jan Fabre, Peter Brook, Sasha Waltz, Michel Piccoli, Krystian Lupa, Robert Lepage, Matthias Langhoff, the Cheek by Jowl theatre company, Ko Murobushi, Romeo Castelucci, Ryoji Okeda, Virgilio Sieni, Pippo Delbono, Tom Bentley-Fisher, Saburo Teshigawara and the Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan, amongst many more, as well as Llu√≠s Pasqual, Mario Gas, N√∫ria Espert, Els Comediants, Dagoll-Dagom, La Fura dels Baus, Paco de Luc√≠a, Cristina Hoyos, Carles Santos, Nacho Duato, Carme Portaceli, √Älex Rigola, Calixto Bieito and Cesc Gelabert, to mention but a few Spanish artists and companies. Moreover, the long list of outstanding musicians that have played the Grec include such prestigious artists as Miles Davis, Pat Metheny, Lou Reed, Manhattan Transfer, Joe Cocker, Celia Cruz, Maria Creuza, Caetano Veloso, UB40, Chuck Berry, Elvis Costello, B.B. King, Bob Dylan, Laurie Anderson, Santana, Youssou N‚ÄôDour, Lokua Kanza, Keith Jarrett, Concha Buika, Antony and the Johnsons and Ryuichi Sakamoto, amongst many more.. The Festival venues Teatre Grec. Built in 1929 in a disused quarry, this ‚ÄúGreek Theatre‚Äù is the veritable soul of the festival. The original idea came to the French architect Jean-Claude-Nicolas Forestier, curator of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, when he visited the quarry and mentioned that it was the ideal site for a theatre. Ramon Revent√≥s i Ferrerons and Nicolau Maria Rubi√≥ i Tudur√≠ were finally commissioned to build the Teatre Grec, though Forestier landscaped the gardens. Teatre Lliure. Founded in 1976 by a group of performing arts professionals linked to the world of independent theatre, the Lliure is one of Barcelona‚Äôs great centres of theatrical creativity. Though its original site was in the Gr√†cia neighbourhood, its main stage is now in the former Palau de l‚ÄôAgricultura de Montju√Øc, which is equipped with first-rate facilities. The Sala Fabi√† Puigserver theatre seats 736 spectators. In 2010, moreover, the Teatre Lliure also recovered the original theatre in Gr√†cia, with capacity for 250 spectators. Mercat de les Flors. The Art Nouveau building that houses the Mercat de les Flors was built for the 1929 Universal Exhibition and was converted into a theatre in 1985, opening with Peter Brook‚Äôs Mahabharata. The building, which is crowned by a spectacular dome measuring twelve metres in diameter, was decorated by the Majorcan artist Miquel Barcel√≥. Since June 2007, the Mercat de les Flors has also housed the Centre for Movement Arts, whose mission is to promote research, production, creation and promotion in the field of dance and the movement arts. The site contains three theatres with capacity for 664, 320 and 80 spectators respectively. Teatre Nacional de Catalunya. Designed by the architect Ricard Bofill, the National Theatre of Catalonia, which opened in 1996, is now one of the most outstanding cultural facilities in Barcelona. A central element in the urban regeneration of the area around Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries, the TNC is a complex formed by a main building that takes its inspiration from the Parthenon in Athens, with two theatres seating 870 and 450, and a second building occupied by services and a third theatre with capacity for 400 spectators. L‚ÄôAuditori. Another driving-force in the redevelopment of Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries and surrounding area, this Auditorium, devoted to music, is housed in a building designed by the architect Rafael Moneo. Opened in 1999, L‚ÄôAuditori is the home of the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (OBC) and the Catalonia College of Music, as well as housing the Music Museum. Its four theatres seat 2,200, 600, 400 and 152 spectators, respectively. The theatres of Barcelona. Shows on the Grec Festival of Barcelona programme are staged at both public spaces and theatres and private venues of varying size, from the Teatre Romea and La Villarroel to alternative sites such as the Sala Beckett and La Caldera centre for dance.. Cultural facilities. The Grec Festival organisers have never hesitated to programme show at venues not originally designed for theatre productions. For example, in recent years, plays and dance performances have been staged at such sites as the Library of Catalonia (a cultural facility housed in the former Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, one of the most outstanding Gothic buildings in Catalonia), Museum of Contemporary Art (Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, MACBA), the Picasso Museum, the Centre for Contemporary Culture (Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona, CCCB), the Joan Mir√≥ Foundation and the CaixaForum art centre.

The squadron was an integral part of the United States' Post Attack Command and Control System, performing the Operation Looking Glass mission with the Boeing EC-135 aircraft. History=World War II From its activation in April 1942 until it was disbanded in 1944, the 2d Ferrying Squadron received aircraft at their factory of origin and ferried them to the units to which they were assigned. (updated after 1994) Liaison duties in the 1950s The 2d Liaison Squadron provided emergency air evacuation, search and rescue, courier and messenger service, routine reconnaissance and transportation of personnel. It regularly operated between Langley Air Force Base, Virginia and Fort John Custis with one Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor and several Stinson L-13s. In July 1952, the squadron closed at Langley and reopened at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, operating de Haviland Canada L-20 Beavers. It operated a regular courier service to Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina and Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina. In 1953, the squadron also began operating Sikorsky H-19 helicopters. The unit was inactivated in June 1954. Airborne Command Post The desire for an Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) to provide survivable command and control of Strategic Air Command's nuclear forces came about in 1958. By 1960, modified KC-135A command post aircraft began pulling alert for SAC under the 34th Air Refueling Squadron (AREFS). On 3 February 1961, Continuous Airborne Operations (CAO) commenced, which meant that there was always at least one Looking Glass aircraft airborne at all times. Starting in 1966, the 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron took over the Looking Glass mission. Eventually, on 1 April 1970, the 2nd ACCS took over the Looking Glass mission flying EC-135C ABNCP aircraft for the duration of the Cold War as a critical member in the Post Attack Command and Control System. There continued to be at least one Looking Glass aircraft airborne at all times providing a backup to SAC's underground command post. Additionally, the 2 ACCS maintained an additional EC-135C on ground alert at Offutt AFB, NE as the EASTAUXCP (East Auxiliary Command Post), providing backup to the airborne Looking Glass, radio relay capability, and a means for the Commander in Chief of SAC to escape an enemy nuclear attack.ALCS Article, page 14-15[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 114-117, 196] The 2nd ACCS was also a major player in Airborne Launch Control System operations. The primary mission of the 2nd ACCS was to fly the SAC ABNCP Looking Glass aircraft in continuous airborne operations, however, due to its close proximity in orbiting over the central US, the airborne Looking Glass provided ALCS coverage for the Minuteman Wing located at Whiteman AFB, MO.

The software is entirely web services based and provides an array of evidence recording tools which are structured around a blog or learner diary. Users can belong to multiple institutions and individual portfolios are owned entirely by the individual. The individual then chooses which institution or institutions to share their portfolios with. Institutions get an aggregated view of portfolios which are members of the institution. The system is primarily used in the UK Education sector and has been involved in a number of Awarding Body projects and qualifications with Assessment and Qualifications Alliance, Edexcel, Scottish Qualifications Authority and Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations. MAPS provides the functionality for OCR's iMedia qualification, the first ever paperless qualification. Features MAPS users create reflections in a blog or learner diary which can include action plans, abilities, achievements, experiences and thoughts. Each blog entry can then be mapped to a portfolio activity which can be assigned by another person from an institution to which the user belongs. An electronic portfolio activity is made up from a number of objectives, criteria or competences. Evidence mapped to a portfolio task can in turn be mapped to these criteria using the Red Pen tool. Evidence loaded into the service is automatically converted into a format that can be viewed within a browser. The tool then allows different users to create layers of annotations in both text and audio format. Assessment criteria can also be dragged into place on the document thus allowing evidence to be linked to precise points within the evidence. User portfolios can also be accessed using a syndicated RSS newsfeed. This allows controlled access to user eportfolios by other interested parties. An integrated CV tool allows users to provide controlled access to their CVs for the purpose of employment. MAPS also incorporates a suite of tool entitled LiveAssess which are the commercial version of those developed by Goldsmiths University in a project entitled e-scape. Since MAPS is 100% a web service it can be integrated into any other platform. Background The team behind MAPS are all educators and advocates of evidence based assessment and have been involved in education technology research for over 20 years.

He is a noted scholar of criminal procedure with expertise in criminal charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing. As a professor, Bibas examined how procedural rules written for jury trials have unintended consequences when cases involving jury trials are the exception, rather than the rule, with 95 percent of defendants pleading guilty. Bibas also studied the role of substantive goals such as remorse and apology in criminal procedure. Early life and education Bibas was born in New York City and spent his summers growing up working for his father, a Greek immigrant who survived the occupation of Greece during World War II, in his family's restaurants. In high school, he became involved in debate and public speaking. He graduated high school at the age of 15 and entered Columbia University. At Columbia, Bibas continued to develop his debate skills through the Philolexian Society and Parliamentary debate. He graduated from Columbia when he was 19 with a Bachelor of Arts (1989) in political theory, summa cum laude. He then went on to attend Oxford University, graduating two years later with a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts (1991) in jurisprudence. While at Oxford, Bibas won the 1st place speaker award in the World Debate Championships. Bibas then attended Yale Law School, where he obtained his Juris Doctor (1994) and was a member of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale Law, Bibas joined the moot court team and won awards for the best oralist and best team, and also served as a symposium editor on the Yale Law Journal. Professional career From 2006 to 2017, Bibas was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He received the Robert A. Gorman Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2008. Bibas previously taught at the University of Chicago Law School and the University of Iowa College of Law and was a research fellow at Yale Law School.See CV, available at http://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/sbibas/ Before beginning his academic career, Bibas was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he successfully prosecuted the world's leading expert in Tiffany stained glass for hiring a grave robber to steal Tiffany windows from cemeteries. Bibas also unsuccessfully prosecuted an alleged $7 theft at the VA hospital in New York. Early in his career, Bibas worked as a litigation associate at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. From 1994‚Äì1995, Bibas clerked for Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He also clerked for Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1997‚Äì1998, where he was a co- clerk with Raymond Kethledge. Bibas is the 15th-most-cited law professor by the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Courts of Appeal, and state high courts as well as the 5th-most-cited professor of criminal law and procedure by law professors. Supreme Court clinic Bibas also directed Penn Law's Supreme Court clinic, for which he litigated a wide range of appellate cases under consideration by the United States Supreme Court. The clinic allows students to assist on real Supreme Court cases, including recruiting, strategising, researching, writing briefs, participating in moot court rehearsals, and attending oral arguments at the Court itself. The Court appointed him to brief and argue Tapia v. United States as amicus curiae. The Court praised Bibas and the clinic for doing \\"an exceptionally good job\\" on that case. Cases argued * Encino Motorcars v. Navarro (2016) * Bank of America v. Caulkett (2015) * Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (2014) * Vartelas v. Holder (2012) * Tapia v. United States (2011) * Turner v. Rogers (2011) Federal judicial service On June 19, 2017, President Trump nominated Bibas to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to fill the seat vacated by Judge Midge Rendell, who took senior status on July 1, 2015. On October 4, 2017, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On October 26, 2017, his nomination was reported out of committee by an 11‚Äì9 roll call vote. On November 2, 2017, his nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by a vote of 53‚Äì43. He received his judicial commission on November 20, 2017.  Notable opinions  Bibas has authored dozens of opinions on a wide range of subjects, including the following selected appeals: * Vorchheimer v. The Philadelphian Owners Association, 903 F.3d 100 (3d Cir. 2018). Writing for the court, Bibas articulated a textual standard for \\"necessity\\" under the Fair Housing Amendments Act. He looked to the ordinary use of the term, citing dictionaries, popular books, and even the Rolling Stones, to determine the term's scope.http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/171738pa.pdf * Jacobs v. Federal Housing Finance Agency, 908 F.3d 884 (3d Cir. 2018). Writing for the court, Bibas upheld, on statutory grounds, the creation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), a government conservator that took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and helped rescue the nation's economy after the housing crisis of 2008, as well as the FHFA's ability to retain Fannie and Freddie's future net profits in exchange for taking on their crisis-era liabilities.https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/173794p.pdf * Cranbury Brick Yard v. United States, 943 F.3d 701 (3d Cir. 2019). Writing for the court, Bibas held that a company that bought an abandoned weapons- manufacturing facility could not sue the United States Military for the cost of cleaning up pollution at the facility. Bibas explained the private causes of action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) through a \\"comical\\" example about a chemical factory in Gotham City that had been polluted by LexCorp and Wayne Enterprises. http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/183287p.pdf * E.O.H.C. v. Secretary U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 950 F.3d 177 (3d Cir. 2020). Writing for the court, Bibas held that district courts have jurisdiction to hear a wide array of \\"now or never\\" challenges to the conditions of an immigrant detainee's confinement. Among them were the plaintiffs' challenges to (1) the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and (2) alleged violations of the Flores Settlement Agreement.http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/192927p.pdf * McCafferty v. Newsweek Media Group, 955 F.3d 352 (3d Cir. 2020). Writing for the court, Bibas affirmed, on First Amendment grounds, the dismissal of a defamation complaint against Newsweek brought by a twelve-year-old, politically vocal supporter of Donald Trump. Bibas wrote: \\"Political discourse can be bruising. People often express opinions that offend others. But the First Amendment protects virtually all of those opinions, even offensive and hurtful ones, to promote a greater good: robust political discourse. The price of free speech is putting up with all sorts of name-calling and hurtful rhetoric.\\"http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/191545p.pdf * Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs v. Attorney General of New Jersey, 910 F.3d 106 (3d Cir. 2018) (Bibas, J., dissenting). Bibas dissented from a majority opinion that upheld New Jersey's ban on large capacity magazines for firearms.

Biography Dividing his youth between Memphis and Nashville, Street Symphony was compelled to pursue a career in music after watching an Outkast concert. With roommates owning equipment, the Sean Combs-influenced entrepreneur began making beats by fiddling with the turntables and drum machines through the night in his Middle Tennessee State University dorm. At school, Street juggled prospects of a bountiful career in Electrical Engineering with his visions of music stardom. In the end, he switched majors, formed a notable area Hip-Hop group Player Way with best friends Mike Sean and Lonnel Matthews and went all in. Through performing at college parties, Street Symphony & Player Way garnered respect and fans on campus, as well as surrounding areas. People took notice, ranging from Street's early mentor Carlos \\"6 July\\" Broady, to NBA champion superstar Gary Payton, who signed the producer to his Rock Solid imprint in 2005. It was there that Street Symphony acquainted himself with big recording studios, honing his original sounding repertoire of beats with the likes of Yo Gotti and Starlito, who were flirting with a Cash Money Records deal. Overnight sessions, traveling, and a tireless hustle gave Street Symphony a director's chair in the action, as he refined his multi-genre, unique style of music. Solidifying his presence in Tennessee, Street Symphony took interest in the Houston hustle. As artists like Paul Wall, Chamillionaire, and Mike Jones were reaching gold and platinum, Street remembered thinking, \\"Let me catch this wave.\\" As he slept on his H-Town friend's floor, worked a day-job, and devoted off hours to his craft, he networked to shop his tracks to any artists he could reach. \\"In the evenings, I'd get out and hustle. I'd go to Guitar Center, in the DJ room, and play my beats so everyone could hear.\\" Local artists took interest, as well as stars like Lil' Keke of the Screwed Up Click. After finding success in Houston, Street Symphony followed Rap's next wave to Atlanta. It was there that he connected with Ludacris's label Disturbing tha Peace working with I-20, Dolla Boy of Playaz Circle & Luda himself. In 2009 he reconnected with friend and former college classmate, Lecrae. With a label, Reach Records behind him, Lecrae hoped to expand his audience and accessibility, attaching the touted- Christian Rap star with music that legitimized his careful message. First contributing to Lecrae's Rehab album, Street Symphony's knowledge and sound attracted his longtime friend and the Reach Records' brass to want him on board. As their flagship artist was kicking down mainstream doors, Street had a musical style and a Rolodex that functioned as a key to the industry's doors. In the subsequent two years, Street Symphony would handle artist and repertoire and executive production of Lecrae's music, especially surrounding his acclaimed Church Clothes mixtape series. In their time together, Lecrae garnered a Top 3 debut, as Street Symphony earned his first GMA Dove Award and Grammy Award, for 2012's Gravity. Continuing his success with Lecrae, Esmond returned to the 2015 GRAMMY Awards, winning as co-writer & producer for Best Christian Contemporary Music Performance/Song, \\"Messengers\\".http://www.cbs.com/shows/grammys/nominees/best-gospel- contemporary-christian-music-performance/ Following his achievements in the Christian Hip Hop subgenre with Lecrae, Street Symphony returned to the mainstream focusing on his Track Or Die production company. After affiliation from working together in The Playaz Circle days, 2 Chainz welcomed Street Symphony to the studio to assist in crafting the EP, Freebase‚Äîincluding video single \\"Trap Back.\\" Additional frequent collaborators include: Yo Gotti, Starlito, Don Trip, Snootie Wild, and Tracy T. Once shopping his sound from Tennessee to Texas to Georgia, top artists are now the ones traveling to Street Symphony to maestro their music. Track Or Die After two years of working on staff as Vice President of A&R;, he departed from Reach Records and in February 2014 launched his own production company/label, Track Or Die. ; Artists * Spade Melo ; In-House Producers * D.O.

This nomenclature is a naming system for products which include those used for the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in humans. The main purpose of the GMDN is to provide health authorities / regulators, health care providers, conformity assessment bodies and others with a single generic naming system. Medical device experts from around the world (manufacturers, healthcare authorities and regulators) compiled the GMDN, based on the international standard ISO 15225. The work was mandated by the European Commission in order to provide the necessary tool to carry out the implementation of the Medical Devices Directive, including the European databank for medical devices (Eudamed). In the draft of the proposed Medical Device Regulation (from the European Commission) it states ‚ÄúTo facilitate the functioning of the European Databank on medical devices (Eudamed), a medical device nomenclature should be available free of charge to manufacturers and other natural or legal persons obliged to use that nomenclature under this Regulation. Furthermore this nomenclature should be provided, to the maximum possible extent free of charge, also to other stakeholders.‚Äù The GMDN is the current nomenclature used by Members States in the National Competent Authority Reports as part of the current EUDAMED system to exchange information on device safetyhttps://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/market- surveillance_en. The GMDN is not yet specified for the UDI database system proposed in new European Regulationshttps://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory- framework_en#new_regulations intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices who have their own UDIs (unique device identifiers) and traceability. Governance The GMDN meets the need to identify medical devices at the global level, as identified in the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) that have since disbanded (2012) and replaced by the IMDRFhttp://www.imdrf.org/about/about.asp GMDN is managed by the GMDN Agency, a non-profit organization and Registered Charity,Charitable organization#United Kingdom which reports to its Board of Trustees, that represent medical device regulators and industry. Structure The GMDN term is in the form of a 5-digit numeric GMDN Code cross-referenced to a specific Term Name and Definition, with which all specific medical devices having substantially similar generic features, can be identified. The following is an example: * GMDN Term Name - \\"Scalpel, single-use\\" * GMDN Code - \\"47569\\" * GMDN Definition - \\"A sterile, hand-held, manual surgical instrument constructed as a one-piece handle and scalpel blade (not an exchangeable component) used by the operator to manually cut or dissect tissue. The blade is typically made of high-grade stainless steel alloy or carbon steel and the handle is often made of plastic. This is a single-use device.\\" The GMDN term and other associated data is copyright protected and the GMDN is a Trademark. Uniquely each GMDN term has a set of attributes, known as Collective Terms, which help to navigate the GMDN Database and aid the selection of a GMDN term by medical condition or product feature. The GMDN is used by regulators, healthcare providers and others for activities such as medical device recalls, adverse event reporting and postmarket surveillance and monitoring, as well as inventory control and other healthcare management functions. The GMDN Agency updates the GMDN utilizing member change requests, to add a new generic device term or to change an existing Term Name or Definition. The decisions are made by an international expert team, according to ISO 15225. The GMDN Agency releases updates to the GMDN on a daily basis, on their interactive website, the GMDN Database. Only Members have access to the GMDN Database and membership is priced according to organization type and size. The GMDN is available in English and other languages. International use The GMDN is used in the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) which has been established by the European Commission to strengthen market surveillance and vigilance. The GMDN has been identified as part of the 'minimum data set' for the proposed US FDA Unique Device Identification regulation for the registration of new Medical Devices intended for use in the United States. This follows the international consensushttp://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf- tech-131209-udi-guidance-140901.pdf established by the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum (IMDRF). The GMDN Agency has recently finalised the business principles that will form the basis of a long term cooperation with the IHTSDO. The Cooperation Agreement shall result in the use of the GMDN as the medical device component of SNOMED CT. This Agreement is consistent with the aims of both organisations to minimise duplication and to support harmonisation. The following objectives were agreed: * A more comprehensive and harmonised clinical terminology * Greater utility and access to both terminologies * Opportunities to improve organisational efficiencies The Agreement will benefit patients across the world and all users of SNOMED CT and the GMDN in promoting comprehensive terminology based medical records, covering the needs of regulators, the medical device industry and healthcare professionals. The arrangement will enhance the application of care to individual patients for medical device, patient risk and safety use cases.

Biography and Child Advocacy In 1985, she moved to Germany with her German then- husband, Dr. Hans-Peter Volkmann by whom she had two sons, Alexander and Constantin. Despite her having custody of the children after the divorce, their father refused to return them to London after a summer holiday visit in 1994.https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1995/jul/05/catherine- laylle This led to her almost decade-long legal battle in the German and English courts to gain access to her sons.https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day- motion/23447 Her account of these events is found in her two books. In October 1997, she married Christopher Meyer on the eve of his departure to Washington to become British Ambassador to the United States.

This has led to close co-operation with the Home Office, the police, CEOP and other charities. She was a member of the Home Secretary's Strategic Oversight Group on missing people, created in 2006 by David Blunkett. Her campaigns have focussed on the difficulties of measuring exactly how many children go missing every year; the adoption by police forces of the Missingkids Website;\\"Missingkids website\\" and the Child Rescue Alert. On 25 May 2011, International Missing Children's Day, the Home Office announced major changes to child protection services in the UK, in particular the passing of responsibility for missing, abducted and exploited children to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection agency (CEOP). This was the culmination of a ten-year lobbying campaign.

The redeye barb lives and feeds on the bottom as well as in the middle of the water column and at the surface. It prefers marginal vegetation in rivers but also occurs in marshes and among the fringing vegetation of lakes. In Swaziland, redeye barbs have been recorded in rock pools in the Komati River, in Lake Malawi it has been recorded where the shoreline is rocky, while in the Lake Rukwa drainage system it occurs in rivers which feed the lake and associated smaller waterbodies and in Lake Chiuta it has been reported as reasonably common in the lake and in slower flowing stretches of the inflow streams. In some drainage systems the redeye barb undertakes seasonal migratory movements. The redeye barb is crepuscular and prefers subdued light but it is also active during the night. Its main prey is invertebrates. There were previously three recognised subspecies but one of these has now been recognised as a separate species Enteromius profundus and the other two are now considered to be morphs of a single monotypic but polymorphic species The redeye barb is a small barb which has salmon or orange-tinted fins, edged with black and a conspicuous red upper half to the eye. It is countershaded with specimens from Lake Malawi having the dorsal surface coloured olive contrasting with the belly silvery white belly, these are separated by a dark lateral stripe which extends from the caudal fin to the snout in the majority of specimens, although in some this may be rather indistinct. The scales lying immediately above this lateral stripe are heavily spotted creating faint longitudinal stripes, markings which become more obvious in preserved specimens. The head is covered in lines of sensory pits which are apparent when a specimen is examined using a handlens. The meristic data is that there are 3 spines in the dorsal fin and 9 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 6 soft rays. The maximum size is 12.0 cm standard length.

Tommaso Besozzi e la morte del bandito Giuliano, thesis by Laura Mattioli, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Bicocca 2003 Camilla Cederna was also among the founders. The magazine stopped publication in 1995. The title returned to the news-stands in 2001 and 2002 as a quarterly, then as a bi-monthly from 2003 to 2007 and a monthly from 2008, until closure in 2013. Orientation L'Europeo is described as independent, secular-oriented and liberal, and the most authoritative in its genre. It combined news, politics, arts, true crime stories and the world of entertainment. The magazine was established in 1945 and had its heyday in the mid-1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Starting with a circulation of 20,000 it sold 300,000 copies already in 1947. The magazine paid special attention to photographic image and documentary photography in the tradition of Life magazine in the United States. According to Benedetti: \\"People look at articles, but read the photos\\" (Gli articoli si guardano, le fotografie si leggono). ¬´L' Europeo¬ª dei ricordi storici, Corriere della Sera, 30 August 2008 Directed mainly at a middle-class and family readership it was slightly more culturally elevated than its popular rival, Epoca. Its political orientation was centrist, but it was also one of the few magazines during the Cold War willing to openly have dialogue with the Italian Communist Party.Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture, CRC Press, 2000, p. 293 L'Europeo had a circulation of 127,422 copies in 1984. Scoops Cover of L'Europeo of July 1950 about the mysterious death of Giuliano Focussing on news and current affairs, the magazine achieved some impressive scoops, one of the most memorable being Tommaso Besozzi's investigative report in July 1950 on the mysterious death of the Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano, which convincingly disproved official accounts of how the bandit had died. The now famous headline of the article read: \\"The only thing certain is that he is dead.\\" Di sicuro c'√® solo che √® morto, Tommaso Besozzi, L‚ÄôEuropeo, 12 July 1950 Tommaso Besozzi una vita in prima pagina, review for Ordine dei Giornalisti, Consiglio Regionale della Lombardia In March 1954 the magazine denounced the U.S. ambassador in Rome, Clare Boothe Luce, of intrusion into Italian internal politics in a speech she made in January at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. She had mentioned electoral fraud perpetrated by the left at the June 1953 elections, advising the government on how to fight the communists. After the denial of Mrs. Luce, a dispute broke out among various journalists including Nicola Adelfi, author of the first scoop, the famous Indro Montanelli, and Benedetti himself.Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945-1956), Simona Tobia (2008) In 1953 the Rizzoli publishing company bought the publication, when during the Korean War the original publisher was not able anymore to cover rising expenses. The price of paper surged from 100 to 280 lire per kilogram. The original editor Benedetti left the magazine and launched a new weekly, L'Espresso, in 1955.Encyclopedia of Italian literary studies, CRC Press, 2007, p. 980 Known journalists that worked for the magazine in the so-called \\"Benedetti school of journalism\\" were Tommaso Besozzi, Enzo Biagi, Giorgio Bocca, Oriana Fallaci and Indro Montanelli, as well as photographers such as Federico Scianna and Oliviero Toscani. Novelist Alberto Moravia wrote weekly film reviews from 1950-1954.Encyclopedia of Italian literary studies, CRC Press, 2007, p. 472 Controversial journalist Oriana Fallaci began her career with L'Europeo. First with celebrity interviews, covering Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s, but progressing rapidly to war correspondent, covering the Vietnam War and the Middle East. In 1968, she was shot as she was covering an army massacre of student protesters in Mexico. In the years 1969 to 1972 L'Europeo published a series of her challenging interviews with prominent politicians such as Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Henry Kissinger, Yasser Arafat, Deng Xiaoping, Fidel Castro and Ayatollah Khomeini. The interviews were often translated and published in the world's most prestigious publications. She harangued Kissinger into calling the Vietnam War \\"useless.\\" Kissinger once said that the interview with Fallaci was \\"the single most disastrous conversation I ever had with a member of the press.\\"Oriana Fallaci, The Guardian, 16 September 2006Oriana Fallaci died, ANSA, 15 September 2006 Decline Its decline started in the second half of the 1970s, when Tommaso Giglio left as chief editor in 1976. He wanted to compete with L‚Äôespresso and Panorama but the publisher was not willing to invest the necessary money. Due to falling sales during the late 1970s, the magazine changed to a small format in 1981. By the early 1990s it regained some ground but was eventually forced to close in 1995. The last issue, in the spring of 1995, was a ‚Äòspecial‚Äô in the same format and graphic design as the first large news format.

She won the American Newbery Medal in 2010, the oldest award in children's literature, for her second novel When You Reach Me. She won the Guardian Prize in 2013 recognizing Liar & Spy as the year's best British children's book by a writer who has not previously won it. Life Born and raised in New York City, Stead enjoyed her elementary school years and fondly remembers reading books in a windowsill or under a table.\\"About\\". Rebecca Stead (rebeccastead.com). She attended Vassar College and received her bachelor's degree in 1989.\\"Rebecca Stead.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2008. Literature Resource Center. Gale. Hennepin County Library. 20 January 2010. Rebecca Stead is married to attorney Sean O'Brien and has two sons. She and her family live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Career Rebecca Stead enjoyed writing as a child but later felt that it was \\"impractical\\" and became a lawyer instead. After years as a public defender she returned to writing after the birth of her two children. She credits her son with inspiring her to write a children's novel, but not in the way one would expect. For years she had collected story ideas and short stories on a laptop, which the child one day pushed off a table, destroying what she considered her serious writing. As a way to lighten her mood she began again with something light-hearted ‚Äîher debut novel First Light, which was published in 2007 by Wendy Lamb Books, an imprint of Random House. When You Reach Me takes place in New York City during 1978‚Äì1988. The story follows Miranda, a sixth grader, as she recalls the events of the past few months, laying out clues and puzzles as she asks an unseen listener to figure it out. The setting is a tiny slice of Manhattan, filled with abundant details and vivid characters. It has been described as suspense with a bit of the supernatural. Miranda is a great fan of Madeleine L'Engle's classic, A Wrinkle in Time, and references to that book help add to the mystery of the novel.The Horn Book Magazine 85.4 (July‚ÄìAugust 2009): p432. Literature Resource Center. Three plot lines run through this novel, seemingly unrelated as the tale begins: Miranda's mother Cheryl prepares to be a guest on The $20,000 Pyramid; Miranda's lifelong friend Sal will no longer speak to her; and \\"the laughing man\\", a very strange homeless man catches Miranda's attention in a strange way. Critical response In review of When You Reach Me, Publishers Weekly applauds Stead's ability to \\"make every detail count\\" as she creates a plausible conclusion with these divergent and improbable plot lines.\\"When You Reach Me\\". Publishers Weekly 256.25 (June 22, 2009): p45. Literature Resource Center.

The New York Times Book Review. p12(L). Literature Resource Center. Stead was awarded the 2010 Newbery Medal by the Association for Library Service to Children for her second book, When You Reach Me. The judges agreed strongly with The New York Times reviewer. According to the chair, \\"Every scene, every nuance, every word is vital both to character development and the progression of the mystery that really is going to engage readers and satisfy them.\\" In 2012, When You Reach Me was ranked number 11 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. It was the only 21st-century work among the top 20. Stead won the 2013 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize for Liar & Spy, which was published in the UK by Andersen Press.

Goodbye Stranger was published by Wendy Lamb in August 2015. In a starred review (its third for Stead's novels), Kirkus Reviews observed that \\"the protagonists try on their new and changing lives with a mixture of caution and recklessness. Stead adroitly conveys the way things get complicated so quickly and so completely for even fairly ordinary children at the edge of growing up ...

It is a town inhabited since prehistoric times, the first city founded in Roman province in the center of deep Algeria, a Roman fortress but originally a Numidian city. Its construction dates from the year 33 av. AD during the reign of Emperor Augustus. Auzia quickly became a powerful city, capital of the highland regions, which relegates to a secondary role the strategic importance of the Roman city of Djemila, the ancient Cuicui, in the wilaya of Setif because of its remoteness from the centers Of Roman power. Roman Empire At the time of the Roman presence in Africa, the city bore the name ofAuzia. The remains of a theater have been spotted there. It is the location of the Roman city Auzia, in the province Mauretania Caesariensis. Names of cities in Algerie in (A.D. 138) Roman times and names now from E-DZ Community  Education & Learning  Algerian History, Culture, Art, Law, Politics (order by start date; start date: 21 Dec 2008). The name Auzia is still used as a Roman Catholic titular bishopric.GCatholic - Titular Episcopal See of Auzia. Then, Auzia was part of the division of the Roman Empire of North Africa. Its position as a city at the gates of the Sahara marked the beginning of the period when the Roman conquest reached the limits of the world known at the time and where the Roman civilization. The city of Auzia has two characteristics in Roman history in North Africa, its great influence on its bureaucratic and military structure and its strategic location as a great religious edifice. Like the construction of the temple of Apollo, supposed to be located at the present site of the civil hospital of Sour-El-Ghozlane. Auzia was equipped with an amphitheater built by the city's bourgeois institution to host shows, such as gladiatorial fights. The ruins also have a bath house, forum and temples. In addition, Auzia is identified as a city with political power dominated by a patriarchal link and entirely in the hands of two comices, organized to reflect at best the tribal divisions of the city. On the other hand, its administrative and military status reveals that it was definitively subjected to the order of the Roman Empire with the status of autonomous city of the Roman province (free zone: region of Algiers to Bou-Saada) caesarean. Auzia is a large city of ovoid form, destined to serve as capital in this region of central Algeria, Auguste had it endowed with several public edifices: a forum (present room of the festivals), several temples, a curia, a market, a theater and large thermal baths. Auzia was erected on a hill at a moderate altitude, where to this day a wall was in good condition in some places, revealing a kind of citadel which protected the inhabitants. Around the year 17 Tacfarinas, who had served in the Roman Army before deserting to take the lead of a revolt by federated Berber tribes and their Moorish neighbors, whose leaders Mazippa, and the Cinithians revolted against the Roman army. The insurrection, based on the tactics of harassment (contemporary guerrilla warfare), stretched from Little Syrte in the east to Mauretania in the west and lasted seven years. The proconsul Cornelius Dolabella ended the war by besieging the fort of Tacfarinas, presumably situated at Auzia, in the year 24 apr. AD It was also the most frequented Roman tourist spot for the gazelle hunting that the city itself was named by the Algerian administration Sour-El-Ghozlane meaning Rampart of the Gazelles. For a long time, Auzia was a commercial city but its development was hampered by several internal conflicts and violent tribal revolts. French Colonial Sour El Ghozlane served under the French as a military post from 1845 and received the name of Aumale in honor of the Duke of Aumale, son of Louis Philippe.Par Mohammed Harbi, 1954, la guerre commence en Alg√©rie (Editions Complexe, 1998) p194].

It is believed that Amona was an ancient centre for trade and commerce with a lot of cultivated fertile land and alluvial banks of the Mhadaee, now Mandovi River. The surrounding land holds many cashew plantations and has a Sesa Goa pig iron plant. The rich soil and centralized location in Gomantak with water networks for inland transport allowed Aryans to settle on the land. Remains of ancient fortresses and settlements submerged in the soil around the ferry wharf region have been reported in Amona, Goa by the archeology department of Goa. The earliest settlers of this region were primarily the Aryan warriors, administrators; and traders. These warriors in medieval times were a part of the Maratha clans. Ancient armour and swords are present in the Amona temples and they reveal an ancient military culture. Scriptures have been found which depict Amona as a capital of ancient dynasties. Amona has given birth to many great people. At the present, Amona is a successful town with almost 90% employment and 98% literacy. Recently a bridge connecting Amona to Panaji has improved connectivity (ferry service was used before the bridge was built). There are many colourful festivals held here with natakaas and gadgado. The Government of Goa launched a project consisting of a road and a bridge connecting the cities of Khandola and Amona across the river Mandovi which is situated 20 km away from Panjim. The area gets often flooded during high tides and the design of the bridge and the road was made accordingly. The bridge is 510 meters in length and is made of a structural steel truss with reinforced cement concrete slab. This bridge has helped to reduce the distance from Sankhali to Panjim to 28 km. It also serves as a tourist spot for people outside Goa. Sanket sinari is a prominent figure from Amona village. He is a master of comedy, a political influencer and an outstanding nurse.
