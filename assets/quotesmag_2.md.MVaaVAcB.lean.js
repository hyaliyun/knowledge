The mansion was built in 1880 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The large brick residence at the top of Grove Hill in the village of Leeds, Massachusetts (part of Northampton) was built in 1880 for Lucius Dimock, the director of the Nonotuck Silk Company. Not coincidentally, it bears a striking resemblance to the company's factory (now Leeds Village apartments), designed in 1879 by architect E. C. Gardner. Gardner, a resident of Ashfield, began his architectural practice in Florence at the age of 22. It is assumed he was a student of the prolific Northampton architect W.F. Pratt. Following the Civil War, Gardner moved to Springfield and maintained a practice there until 1911. The interior of the Dimock mansion reveals the influence of Charles Locke Eastlake, author of Hints on Household Taste published in 1872. Eastlake emphasized superb craftsmanship and the use of cherry and oak woods which remain unpainted to reveal their natural grain. \\"The Eastlake staircase, structural ceiling treatments, wainscots, parquet floors, doors with intricate inlays, and a chapel in the attic offer the most spectacular domestic interior to be seen in our area,\\" wrote Karl S. Putnam in 1954. Mr. Putnam, who was the dean of Northampton architects for many years, described Grove Hill in glowing terms in the Northampton Tercentenary History Book. An 1890 photo of the mansion. The Lucius Dimock home was built on the site of the Benjamin North homestead which was moved 100 yards to the north in 1879. The Grove Hill estate included a large fruit orchard, a greenhouse, and stables for several beautiful driving horses and carriages. A large barn housed Dimock's herd of cows. On the southern boundary was a high English-style stone wall. Grove Hill was purchased in the 1970s by Samuel Goldman who lived there for several years. In the 1990s, the interior was subdivided into several condominiums. The tower, which is a prominent element on the exterior of the house, remains intact along with the wood bracketed shed roofs. The tower was renovated in 1999, turning the rooftop gazebo into an interior room. The mansion continues to reveal E.C. Gardner's original design.Historic Northampton See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hampshire County, Massachusetts References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Northampton, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hampshire County, Massachusetts Category:Houses in Hampshire County, Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1880 ","title":"Grove Hill Mansion"},{"id":"18721628","text":"The Manse is a historic church manse at 54 Prospect Street in Northampton, Massachusetts. With a construction history dating to 1744, it is in part a good example of vernacular mid-18th century architecture. It has also had a procession of locally notable owners and residents. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Manse is located in a residential area north of downtown Northampton, on the west side of Prospect Street at its junction with Trumbull Road. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gambrel style roof and twin interior chimneys. Three dormers pierce the steep slope of the gambrel, the center one with a rounded arch roof, the outer two with hip roofs. A square cupola rises at the center of the roof. A 2-1/2 story ell, the oldest part of the building, extends to the rear. The property's history begins in the 17th century, when it was part of a land grant to Reverend Solomon Stoddard, whose parsonage was built here in 1684. Stoddard was the pastor of the first church in Northampton and the grandfather of Jonathan Edwards, a leading force in the First Great Awakening who briefly lived in that house. In 1744, Stoddard's son John built what is now the rear ell as a replacement for that house. John Stoddard was active in a civic affairs, serving in the provincial militia and the provincial legislature. His son, also named Solomon, built the front portion of the house in 1782; he served as sheriff of Hampshire County. Other notable residents include Josiah G. Holland, writer and founder of Scribner's Monthly, and Dr. Benjamin Barrett, a prominent local politician. The house was purchased in 1940 by Dorothy Douglas, a professor at Smith College, who oversaw its restoration. She also commissioned a series of murals that now adorn its walls; these were executed by Oliver Larkin.

Description and history The Miss Florence Diner is located in the center of the village of Florence, about west of downtown Northampton. It sits on the north side of Main Street, just east of its junction with Maple Street. It has an L-shaped configuration, with barreled roofs in both directions, topped by a parapet on which the name of the diner appears in Moderne lettering. Mounted at the corner of the L is a distinctive chevron-shaped sign that bears its name. The exterior is finished mainly in enamel paneling, and the interior is finished in wood, tile, and enamel. The main entrance is now via a brick vestibule, which has a barrel-style shingled roof that extends over the side-facing steps. The diner is attached at the rear to a house that has been converted into a restaurant. The Miss Florence was opened in 1941 by Maurice Alexander and his wife, Pauline Florence (Matusewicz) Alexander. Originally located across the street in a different diner, it moved into what is now the core of the present structure later that year. That diner was manufactured by the Worcester Lunch Car Company, which also executed the enlargements to give it the L shape in 1949.

The hospital building was constructed in 1856. It operated until 1993, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Construction of the State Hospital at Northampton, the third state institution for the insane in the state of Massachusetts began on March 15, 1856 on top of Hospital Hill outside of Northampton, Massachusetts.History of Northampton State Hospital The hospital was originally known as the Northampton Lunatic Asylum. On July 4 (United States Independence Day) of the same year the cornerstone was laid. For posterity, a time capsule was embedded within the cornerstone, where it would lie undisturbed on top of Hospital Hill for 150 years. The hospital consisted of Old Main (the original Kirkbride hospital building), and infirmaries, staff dormitories, a work farm, and other buildings including a brand new memorial complex which was established later. The asylum received its first patients on August 16, 1858. Within six weeks, the population would reach 220, most of whom were transfers from other institutions long overwhelmed. The original design specified a maximum of 200 patients, but this limit was raised to 250 by the statewide hospital Commissioners before the asylum opened. After only two months the Board of Trustees speculated that the limit could be raised to 300 patients. As the patient population accelerated, the wards of Old Main were built onto so much that its original design looked nothing like its new shape. Soon, the population grew so much that several new infirmaries had to be built to sustain the patients. The first superintendent, Dr. Prince, resigned in 1864, and Dr. Pliny Earle was selected as his replacement. Dr. Earle immediately began to cultivate a strong work therapy program by expanding the farm, constructing a greenhouse as well as other service-oriented buildings. When he retired in 1885, Dr. Earle was given an apartment within the asylum out of gratitude for his twenty-one years of service. The population had reached 476 patients. The start of the 20th century was marked with a change in name from the State Hospital at Northampton to the Northampton Insane Hospital, and two years later to Northampton State Hospital. Northampton State Hospital, under superintendent John A. Houston, continued constructing buildings such as large infirmary wards built on either end of the hospital in 1902 and 1903. In 1907, the same year Bishop's Crook lamps were installed around the hospital grounds, ‚ÄúA Mind That Found Itself‚Äù was published. In it Clifford W. Beers, a former patient of several institutions, argues that contrary to what the public had been led to believe, no one knew how to cure insanity. That year the population at Northampton stood at 726 patients. Designed to accommodate 1000 patients, in 1925 work began on the largest expansion of Northampton State Hospital: Memorial Complex. Set apart from the original ‚ÄúOld Main‚Äù section of the asylum, Memorial Complex became the focal point for most of the construction, expansions and later operations of Northampton State Hospital, and it allowed the population to swell to more than 2,100 patients in 1935. As the asylum's population became crowded, patients were deported to other hospitals and several small buildings were built around Old Main. Old Main had been expanded upon so much, the original shape of the building no longer resembled a bat wing. After nearly a century of constant construction, Northampton State Hospital continued to grow. In 1952, the year Thorazine, the first anti-psychotic was introduced, 2,331 patients were served by 509 staff. The Haskell building, which still serves as an office for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, was added in 1959. On January 6, 1978 the United States District Court approved the Brewster Consent Decree, which made clear a patient's constitutional right to treatment in the least restrictive environment possible. Under terms set forth in the Decree, the State Hospital was to reduce the number of patients it served to 50 by 1981. This process would ultimately take 14 rather than 3 years. In 1980, Northampton State Hospital registered its 64,500th admission, while simultaneously attempting to reduce the total population. Patients were either reassigned to other, usually smaller facilities, or were simply dismissed. Ex-patients entered a largely ignorant and sometimes hostile community; for some, poverty and homelessness were as immediate as the citywide controversy. Debate raged all around Northampton. After 130 years, Old Main was abandoned in 1986. Operations at Memorial Complex continued until 1993, when the last 12 patients were reassigned, and Northampton State Hospital was officially closed. Once the hospital was closed, conversations began to arise around reuse and preservation of the buildings. Members of the community, including former city councilor Mike Kirby, formed the group Save Old Main, with the mission to restore the Old Main building of the hospital and preserve it for historical purposes. The group led walking tours of the grounds and ‚Äútalk about the history of the hospital.‚Äù Since the hospital played a role in Northampton‚Äôs history, they believed it should be preserved in some way. Due to the growing homeless population of Northampton, however, many believed the vacated buildings should be used as a shelter or something of the like. On April 15, 1996, six young activists were arrested for trespassing on the grounds of the hospital. The group, consisting mostly of first-year Hampshire students, attempted an occupation of the Earle Street building with the mission that the building be used as transitional housing for homeless people. Most of the students played roles in their local Food Not Bombs chapters and they all took part in meetings for a local group working to address the homelessness in Northampton, the Next Step Housing Collaborative. Following the arrests, the chief of security for the Northampton State Hospital states that breaking and entering the vacated buildings would bring prosecution. The community continued to gather in hopes of addressing this issue. A forum was held on September 29, 1996 at the Northampton Center for the Arts and a conference entitled ‚ÄúOur Neighbors: Homeless in the Valley‚Ä¶ Why??!!‚Äù was held on November 2, 1996 at the Christ United Methodist Church. Short and long terms solutions were brainstormed, some of which revolved around the hospital: ‚ÄúKeep the pressure on to make sure that low-cost housing is developed at the former Northampton State Hospital.‚Äù Despite these efforts and their popularity, city administrators only seriously considered demolition to redevelop the propertyIn 2006 Old Main was finally demolished, and by the following summer, the Memorial Complex was gone. In 2007, the city of Northampton adopted a smart growth zoning overlay district covering the grounds of the Northampton State Hospital as part of Massachusetts's \\"Smart Growth Zoning Overlay District Act\\" enacted in 2004. The zoning district is designed to promote mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly development, and in 2008, the 40-unit Village Hill development broke ground on the former hospital grounds. Memorialization efforts On November 17 and 18, 2000 a series of memorial events took place in Northampton focusing on the history of Northampton State Hospital. The two-day event titled \\"The State Hospital: In Memoriam\\" included an academic symposium, an open forum with former patients, and three art exhibitions. The event was sponsored by the Massachusetts Mental Health Center (MMHC) Continuing Education Program and offered continuing education credits to psychologists and nurses in attendance.Moore, J. Michael and Anna Schuleit Harber. Images of America Northampton State Hospital, Arcadia Publishing, 2014, p. 114-121. The first day of the academic symposium featured the research and experiences of psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and academics from around the United States. An open forum took place the morning of the second day, during which former patients shared stories of their experiences inside the hospital. The event closed with a sound installation at the site of the hospital's Old Main building. The art installation was designed by visual artist Anna Schuleit Haber and intended to reference the events of the laying of the hospital cornerstone in 1856. Attendants of the forum walked in procession to the former hospital grounds. At noon, bells from surrounding churches rang in unison to invoke a communal moment of silence, followed by ‚ÄúHabeas Corpus,‚Äù a sound installation in which J.S. Bach's Magnificat, played on installed speakers from inside the empty old main building. The memorial series closed after the end of the 28-minute sound installation.Pamphlet titled ‚ÄúThe State Hospital: In Memorium,‚Äù November 2000, Box 3, Folder 1, Northampton and Local History, Smith College Archives.

Originally located facing the Belchertown Common, this 1880 Victorian, one of the most architecturally exuberant buildings in the town, was moved to its present location in 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  Description and history  The Walker-Collis House occupies a prominent location in the town center of Belchertown, at the southeast corner of Stadler Street at United States Route 202. It is a rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly rectangular in plan, with a roof that is a hybrid style between mansard and gambrel roofs. The second story face is angled in the mansard style, but finished with wooden shingling, while the steeper top portion of the roof is finished in asphalt shingles. Exterior finishes include liberally applied Stick style elements, and interior finishes are lavish. The house was built in 1880 by Myron Walker (1846-1911), a state senator who had spent significant time in New York and California. Walker had made a fortune during his travels, and reportedly spent $30,000 to build the lavish mansion; the gas heating plant in the building was also said to be used for heating of the bandstand on the common, and to provide gas street lighting in the area. Walker's fortune fell after his 1889 divorce, and the property was inherited by his nephew. It was then owned for much of the 20th century by the Collis family. Threatened with demolition, it was moved to its present site in 1976 and rehabilitated.

Operated by lines 18 and 19, it serves the area of Nordstrand and the neighborhoods of Ekeberg, Jomfrubr√•ten, Bekkelaget and Ljan. The line is operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift using SL79 and SL95 trams on contract with Ruter. The line itself is owned by Sporveien. At Oslo Hospital, the line connects to the Gamleby Line, which runs to the city center. Proposals for a line in the area were first launched 1897, but not until 1914 were the necessary permits granted. The line was built and operated by Ekebergbanen. The line opened in 1917, and connected to the Gamleby Line to reach Stortorvet in the city center. The line differed from the street trams in that it ran in its own right of way and used 1,200 volt supply, unlike the 600 volts used in the streets. In the early 1930s, the line was rebuilt to double track and a branch, the Simensbr√•ten Line, was built. The Ekeberg Line was extended to its current terminus in 1941. In 1948, the company was taken over by the municipal Oslo Sporveier and operations were integrated in 1965. The line was nearly closed in 1967 and 1973, but during the 1970s, the line received new rolling stock and a renovation. Future plans include an extension to Hauketo Station on the √òstfold Line and a new route via Bj√∏rvika to the city center. Route SL79 tram approaching Holtet The Ekeberg Line is a long continuation of the Gamleby Line, from which it connects at Oslo Hospital, located near sea level and from Stortorvet, the traditional terminus in the city center. The entire line is built as a light rail with its own right-of-way. The line is electrified at 750 volts with overhead wires. It runs up Ekeberg on the east side of Kongsveien, passing Sj√∏mannsskolen at above mean sea level (AMSL) and from Oslo Hospital. The next station is Jomfrubr√•ten, which is located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL. This is where the Simensbr√•ten Line previously branched off. Past Jomfrubr√•ten, the Simenbr√•ten Line, while it existed, ran under the Ekeberg Line. The next station is Sportsplassen, located further south, at AMSL, followed by Holtet, which is from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL. Holtet is the location of the depot and a balloon loop. At Holtet, the line crosses Kongsveien and continues along the west side of Ekebergveien. The next station is S√∏rli, which is located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL, followed by Kastellet located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL. The line continues past Br√•ten, located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL and past S√¶ter, located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL. Between S√¶ter and Ljabru is a bridge over Nordstrandsveien which is single tracked. Ljabru is the terminus and is located from Oslo Hospital and at AMSL. Service S√¶ter Station The Ekeberg Line is served by lines 18 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. Line 19 always runs the full length of the line, while Line 18 does not operate from Ljabru to Holtet during the morning and afternoon. Line 18 connects via the city center to the Ullev√•l Hageby Line while Line 19 runs onwards along the Briskeby Line. Travel time from Ljabru to Holtet is 7 minutes, to Oslo Hospital is 14 minutes and to Jernbanetoget is 20 minutes. Both of the lines run every 10 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes during the evenings and part of the weekends and every 30 minutes during early mornings on weekends. This gives a peak service of every 5 minutes along the Ekeberg Line. The service is provided using high-floor SL79 and low-floor SL95 trams. Because of the lack of a balloon loop at Rikshospitalet, Line 18 must be operated with SL95 units, while SL79 units are used on Line 19 because the Brikeby Line does not have a high enough permitted axle load to for the SL95 units. History=Construction The Nordstrand area of Aker was first served by steam ships from the 1860s, which connected the lower areas to Oslo. In 1879, the √òstfold Line (then the Smaalen Line) opened in 1879, giving these areas a regular service unaffected by the weather. In 1897, a public meeting was held regarding transport in the upper parts of Nordstand, the Ekeberg area. On 15 March 1899, Solicitor Einar Borgen, Engineer A. J. Jackwitz and Robert Iversen sent an application to build an electric railway from Oslo to Ljan. They were later supplemented with Contractor S. S√∏rensen. The application was considered in Aker Municipal Council on 14 March 1901, and placed on hold. It was again considered a year later, this time it was placed on hold because the politicians wanted to see how the new Railway Act would affect the plans. A new application for the same route was made on 16 April 1907, this time from Solicitor H. M. Helliesen, Wholesaler A. Thune-Larsen, and Works Manager T. Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway rather than as a railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (then called the Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo went at Sj√∏mannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would only have to be built from Oslo Hospital to Sj√∏mannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line. Ekeberg trams at Stortorvet in the city center in 1918 The plans were sent from the ministry to the municipality, whose council passed the plans on 12 November 1908. Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could demand that the line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. The concession was again considered on 2 November 1911, and there it was decided that the concession would be removed if the line was not finished by the end of 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject to reports on the issue. The report suggested a different route, which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedg√•rd. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien. The Labour Party rejected the line, stating that they did not want any transport that made it easier to live outside the municipal boundary, to keep tax money within the municipality. The final permission from Oslo City Council was granted after a vote with 49 to 35 in May 1913. Concession from the ministry was granted from Sj√∏mannsskolen to Ljan on 7 October, and from Oslo Hospital to Sj√∏mannsskolen on 11 December. On 5 June 1914, permission was granted where the concession was transferred from Thune-Larsen and Helliesen to the company Ekebergbanen, which was founded on 27 March 1914. The company received a share capital of NOK 850,000, later increased to 2.5 million. Engineer J√∏rgen Barth became the first director. Since the application, there had been a technological development within tramways. Barth started working with the plans, and proposed that the line be built as a light rail in its own right-of-way, similar to that of the Holmenkollen Line and the R√∏a Line on the west side of town. This would allow higher speeds. The plans called for the line to run on the east side of Kongsvien until Holtet, after which it would cross the road and continue on the west side Ekebergveien, until it reached Nordstrandsveien. The end of the line would have a balloon loop. After the revised plans were approved by the authorities, construction started in August 1914. Most of the works were finished in 1917. The original line consisted of double track from Oslo Hospital to Sj√∏mannsskolen, and single track from Sj√∏mannsskolen to S√¶ter. Holtet received a passing loop, in addition to the line's depot. The parish hall at S√¶ter was bought and made a combined station and office. The Ekeberg Line at Sj√∏mannsskolen in 1937 Early years The company bought five bogie trams. They had pointed ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, and had a low-floor center section, with internal steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 seated passengers. In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. M√∏rk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was retrospectively decided by the ministry that the official opening date was 1 July. Initially there were two services per hour, but this quickly turned out to be too little. However, because of World War I and problems receiving supplies from Germany, it was not until November that all five trams were delivered and a 15-minute headway could be introduced. The company also started purchasing land to allow a future double track and widening of the loading gauge to allow for the wide trams used on the Holmenkollen Line. Also four services per hour proved to be too little. The company had chosen to electrify the line at 1,200 volts instead of the 600 volts used in the rest of the tram network, so the company could not operate rented trams from other operators. The junction between the two networks at Oslo Hospital had a section without overhead wires. This allowed both of the pantographs to not touch their wire when the current was switched. When changing between the currents, the lighting, heating, compressor and battery chargers all had to be manually changed with a switch. In 1919, the company ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with electric equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These were the first in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit train control. They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa trailers were delivered in 1925. However, the two- axled trailers did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from Atelier M√©tallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929. To allow more frequent services, the line needed to be rebuilt to double track. The first section was from Sportsplassen to Holtet, which opened with double track on 16 January 1930. Next followed the section from Holtet to Kastellet on 12 February 1931, and finally from Sj√∏mannsskolen to Sportsplassen on 30 September 1931. This occurred at the same time the Simensbr√•ten Line was built, as a branch from Jomfrubr√•ten to Simensbr√•ten. Construction of the Simensbr√•ten Line started in December 1928; and this resulted in the Ekeberg Line past Jomfrubr√•ten being moved. Instead of following the street Kongsveien, it the line was moved to a higher elevation. The double-tracked Ekeberg Line was placed on the new line, while the single-tracked Simensbr√•ten Line would follow the old route along Kongsveien. The Simensbr√•ten Line would thus cross under the Ekeberg Line and then through a curve turn onto its right-of-way. The Simensbr√•ten Line was completed in mid-1931 and was officially opened on 30 September 1931. On the city section, the tracks had been gradually rebuilt to allow wide and long trams to run on the tramway, including the Gamleby Line. In 1930, tram 1003 was rebuilt to that width. It proved too heavy, and Ekebergbanen ordered new trams which were wider. When delivered, they were capable of hauling a tram up the hills at . The Ekeberg Line in 1929 In 1925, the √òstfold Line was rebuilt to double track, and the section past Hauketo was moved, including the demolishing of the Ljan Viaduct. In June 1926, Aker Municipality started the process to demand that the line be extended onwards from S√¶ter. However, Ekebergbanen stated that the rebuilding of the √òstfold Line removed the need of the extension. The company instead applied for concession to extend the line southwards towards Hvervenbukta on Ljanskollen's west side. This was rejected by Aker Municipality. In exchange for not being allowed to extend the line, Aker Municipality agreed to not press the issue of their preferred extension for the time being. At the time, Akersbanerne was working on building the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in what became known as the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK 50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Br√•ten. During the construction at S√¶ter, the trams turned at Br√•ten and backed to S√¶ter, where they used the turning loop. The thousand meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941. World War II and the limitations on fuel gave the Ekeberg Line a large increase in traffic, from four million passengers in 1939 to eight million in 1944. Unlike many other Norwegian tramways, the tram vehicles were not confiscated and moved to Germany, because no German tramways used both 1,200 volts and allowed wide vehicles. A new depot building was built in 1942 and 1943, which allowed wide trams. Following the end of the war, it was decided that Oslo and Aker would merge. Ekebergbanen's concession lasted until 30 June 1947, which was initially extended on year. In March 1948, Oslo Sporveier, the municipal company that operated among other things the street tramways, offered to purchase Ekebergbanen. All but eight shares were sold, and from December the board of Ekebergbanen and Oslo Sporveier was identical. However, the company retained its own name, administration, rolling stock and personnel. Holtet. At the top right of the image is the depot. After the nationalization, the company started a renovation process of the infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment from some of the older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952. Threat of closure and renewal In 1960, the Oslo City Council voted to close the street tramway and replace all routes with either diesel buses or the Oslo Metro. The specific plans for the Ekeberg Line were not decided, although the line was considered either to be a stand-alone light rail or connected to the metro. From 30 October 1960, the route for the Ekeberg Line trams in the city changed, so they instead followed the route Schweigaards gate ‚Äì Vognmannsgata ‚Äì Jernbanetorget ‚Äì Kirkeristen to Stortorvet instead of the old route via Gr√∏nland and Brugata. From 1963, the route terminated at Jernbanetorget, after the rest of the route was closed due to the construction of the metro. From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier took over the operation of the Ekeberg Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the √òstensj√∏ Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbr√•ten Line was to be closed. In 1960, the sale of cars in Norway was deregulated and the management of the public transport system was changed to become that of providing services to those who could not drive their own car. The Ekeberg Line lost traffic because it did not operate to the city center, and with the 1960 decision in the city council was it not permissible to lay new tracks to Stortorvet. Therefore, locals suggested that the trams continue along the track from Jernbanetorget to Sk√∏yen, on the west side of town. At first the proposal was rejected by Oslo Sporveier because it was \\"technically impossible\\". From June 1967, Line 9, that ran along the Lilleaker Line via the Sk√∏yen Line to the city center and onwards along the √òstensj√∏ Line, was truncated to Jernbanetorget, as the √òstensj√∏ was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Sk√∏yen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Sk√∏yen was taken into use on 4 May 1969. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again proposed closing the Ekeberg Line. This time the reason was the construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK 3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services. The last of the older Ekeberg Line trams to Sk√∏yen ran on 5 August 1973. From the following day, all trams turned at a new balloon loop at Vognmannsgata. Investments included a new track at Holtet Depot, and of new double track in its own right-of-way along Biskop Gunnerus gate from Postgirobygget to Kirkeristen. A double track from S√¶ter to Ljabru was discarded because there was no need for it. The last of the old trams ran on 22 September, and from 24 September the line was switched from 1,200 to 600 volts. Ordinary service with Gullfisk trams from Ljabru to Jar on the Lilleaker Line started on 29 September. The new service involved a 10-minute headway at daytime and a 20-minute headway during the evenings. In 1976, a Gullfisk lost control on the line and derailed near Sj√∏mansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This was not sufficient, and Oslo Sporveier considered introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But this would be costly, as the vehicles would have to be upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from S√¶ter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked. In 1982 and 1983, the SL79 articulated trams were introduced on the line. In 1988, the line to Jar was supplemented with a rush- hour route which connected with the Ullev√•l Hageby Line west of Oslo. From 28 August 1988, a service started running from Ljabru and connecting with the Ullev√•l Hageby Line. Weekend night services started operating from 18 November 1989. From 1988 to 1991, the section of the Gamleby Line along Schweigaards gate was rebuilt to light rail standard in its own right-of-way. In this period, the line received new catenary and many stations were renovated. The new section was taken into use on 4 January 1991. Along with the rest of the tram system the voltage was increased to 750 volts on 4 June 2000. This allowed the new SL95 low-floor trams to operate on the line. In 2002 the board of Oslo Sporveier proposed closing the Ekeberg Line along with the Kjels√•s Line, but this was stopped by the general assembly. Future The Ekeberg Line is proposed extended from Ljabru to Hauketo Station on the √òstfold Line. To routes have been proposed, either along Ekebergveien, or in a tunnel further east. The extension will allow better correspondence southwards, including transfer to the Oslo Commuter Rail and Ruter buses. Financing has been secured through Oslo Package 3. As part of the Fjord City and redevelopment of Bj√∏rvika, the Ekeberg Line has been proposed to follow a new line on the south side of Oslo Central Station to Jernbanetorget, with stops at Bj√∏rvika and Middelalderparken. As an alternative, it has been proposed that the tracks along Schweigaards gate be kept and that the trams along the Ekeberg Line alternate running via Bj√∏rvika and Schweigaards gate. Upgrades on the southernmost part of the line will take place during 2014 that will shorten journey times. The single track bridge between S√¶ter and Ljabru over Nordstrandveien will be demolished and replaced with a new double track bridge. In addition, two curves on the line will be straightened out.

Built about 1744, it is one of Amherst's oldest surviving houses, and a fine example of mid-18th century Connecticut River Valley architecture. It was given to the Amherst Historical Society in 1916. It currently houses the Amherst History Museum. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and included in the Amherst Central Business District in 1991. Description and history The Strong House is located just west of the commercial center of Amherst, set well back from the north side of Amity Street at Prospect Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a gabled portico. The first-floor windows are capped by projecting cornices, and the steep roof face is pierced by two gabled dormers. Although it was first built about 1744, much of its present appearance dates to late 18th-century alterations. It was built about 1744 by Nehemiah Strong, only six years after formal settlement of Amherst began. Originally a 2-1/2 story saltbox in configuration, it was enlarged by Strong's son Simeon in the 1790s, when the gambrel roof and front portico were added. Simeon Strong was a prominent local lawyer, who served in a number of town posts and also represented it in the state legislature before being appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. His son and grandson, who continued ownership of the property, were also prominent in local fairs.

Its importance rests in its significance as the site of a utopian community that operated there from 1841 to 1845, and for its use as a site on the Underground Railroad. Once part of a parcel, the property has been reduced to , whose only significant structure is the farmhouse which was built in 1825. History The farmhouse was built by Thomas Burt, whose father acquired the property in 1798. The house is a typical late colonial/early Federalist center chimney layout, and retains many of its original features, despite a number of alterations. A 19th century piazza (porch) was removed early in the 20th century, and a Colonial Revival entry and brick stoop were added at the time in an apparent effort to restore the house's appearance. In 1834 Burt sold the property to Samuel Whitmarsh, under whose ownership the property reached its greatest extent. Whitmarsh planted mulberry trees and built a silk mill on the nearby Mill River. He sold the house and to the Northampton Association for Education and Industry (NAEI), who operated the property as an experiment in communal living until 1845. The farm next came into the hands of Austin Ross, whose family owned the property until 1902. Under the Ross family ownership two outbuildings were built: a hay barn just east of the house and a tobacco drying barn on the northern end of the surviving property (both built c. 1880). A corn crib was added in the early 1900s, and a utilitarian concrete worker housing structure was added in the 1950s. None of the outbuildings contribute to the importance of the property. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Utopian community and Underground Railroad The NAEI was part of a movement in the 1840s in which a number of communal living societies were established (one of the more well-known was Brook Farm outside Boston). One of the leaders of the NAEI was George Benson, brother-in-law to abolitionist firebrand William Lloyd Garrison. The organization operated the silk works begun by Whitmarsh, and provided a school, a store, and housing for the community members. Its membership peaked in 1844 with 120 members. It was operated on principles of equality, and most of its members were dedicated abolitionists. They in particular included African Americans in the community, a rarity for the time, including Sojourner Truth. The property has a well documented history as a major meeting point on the Underground Railroad. Austin Ross came from Chaplin, Connecticut, and was, like the NAEI members, a committed abolitionist. The farm continued to act as a station on the Underground Railroad during his ownership.

It is open seasonally, from May to October. The house contains the collection of one extended family, with objects dating from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries. It was occupied from its construction in 1752 until the 1940s, when a member of the eighth generation of the family in the house turned it into a museum. Its collection is entirely derived from the family, and the extensive archives, including the original diary of Elizabeth Porter Phelps, are held at Amherst College. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Porter‚ÄìPhelps‚ÄìHuntington House is located in a rural setting of northern Hadley, between River Drive (Massachusetts Route 47) and the Connecticut River. The main block of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. To its rear is attached an older 1-1/2 story frame structure with a gabled roof. The front facade has symmetrically but unevenly placed windows flanking a center entrance. The house's construction history begins in 1752, when Moses Porter built what is now the ell. It was the first house to be built outside Hadley's stockaded town center. The house achieved its present form in the 1790s, when the larger front portion was built by Charles Phelps, a lawyer who had married Porter's daughter Elizabeth. The house next passed to Dan Huntington, who had married the Phelps daughter. The family was very prominent locally, dating back to the founding of Hadley in 1659. Some members of the extended family achieved prominence regionally, nationally, and internationally. These include Benjamin Lincoln, a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution; Frederic Dan Huntington, first Episcopal bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central New York; and composer Roger Sessions.  Slavery at the Porter-Phelps-Huntington Estate  The Porter-Phelps- Huntington estate serves as an excellent lens through which to view the history of slavery in Western Massachusetts, especially in the town of Hadley. Slavery has existed in Hadley since the town's founding, and the first four ministers of the town were all slave owners. Samuel Porter, the great- grandfather of Moses Porter, bought the Porter family‚Äôs first slave in 1698 from a man named Joseph Smith.Smith, Joseph and Rebekah (1698). Letter to Samuel Porter. Amherst College Archives. Later on, when Moses Porter set up his estate in 1752, he owned two slaves: a boy named Zebulon Prutt and a girl named Peg. Phelps bought Zebulon from a man named Jerusha Chauncey, a fellow resident of Hadley. Zebulon was fourteen years old at the time of sale, and Porter paid one hundred and fifty pounds to Chauncey for him.Chauncey, Jerusha (1745). Letter to Moses Porter. Amherst College Archives. When Phelps died in 1756, both Zebulon and Peg were listed in the probate inventory of Porter‚Äô possessions.An Inventory of the Estate of Capt Moses Porter Late of Hadley. Report. March 8, 1756. Hadley, MA. Amherst College Archives. Ten years after his master‚Äôs death, Zebulon ran away, returning to the estate over a year later to find out that he had been sold to another man by Moses‚Äô wife Elizabeth.Romer, Robert (2009). Slavery in the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts. Florence, MA: Levellers Press. p. 176. . Moses and Elizabeth‚Äôs daughter, also named Elizabeth, married a man Charles Phelps in 1770, and the two took over the estate from Moses and Elizabeth senior. That same year, Phelps bought a slave named Cesar for \\"sixty six pounds, thirteen shillings, and four pence\\" from a man named William Williams in New Marlsborough, New York.Williams, William (1770). Letter to Charles Phelps. Amherst College Archives. He and Elizabeth also had a slave named Phyllis, who served the family as Elizabeth‚Äôs person house slave. After the start of the Revolutionary War, Cesar to fight went in place of Charles Phelps. It was not uncommon for wealthy colonists to send slaves to fight in their place, often promising them freedom in exchange for their service. It seems that Charles Phelps was one of those owners, and that he promised Cesar his freedom if he went to fight. In a letter back to Charles Phelps from Fort Ticonderoga, Cesar wrote: > ‚ÄúI take this opportunity to enform [sic] you that I don‚Äôt entend [sic] to > live with Capt. Cranston if I can help it and I could be glad if you would > send me a letter that I may git [sic] my wagers [sic] and I want to know how > all the Talk Do at Home and I Desire you Prayers for me While in the Sarves > [sic] and if you Determine to see me I want you Shud [sic] send me my Sock > and Buckel [sic] So no more at Present but I Remain your Even Faithful > Slave. > \\\\- Sezor Philips\\"Phelps, Cesar (September 30, 1776).

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was further listed as a contributing property to the Ware Millyard Historic District in 1986. Description and history The Otis Company Mill No. 1 stands on the east side of the main village of Ware, between East Main Street and the Ware River east of South Street. It is a five-story mill building fashioned out of coursed stone, and was built in 1845. It is a rectangular structure, topped by a gable roof, with projecting stairwell sections in roughly the middle of both of its long sides. The mill presents four stories to the street, owing the sloping terrain of the riverfront lot. Iron tie rods are found in patterns on the building exterior; these provide stability for the wooden elements of the floor supports. The mill was probably built by Belchertown mill builder Nathaniel Dudley Goodell, and is the only stone mill in the town. It is one of a small number of mills built in western Massachusetts on the Rhode Island model of mills, and is one of the only ones to date before the introduction of turbines into the water power system. The mill was built for the Otis Company, which initially manufactured woven cotton fabric, but later branched out into underwear. The company was Ware's largest employer for about 100 years.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Easthampton's former town farm is located in a rural setting west of downtown Easthampton, on the north side of Oliver Street opposite Hollister Drive. The main building was built in a manner typical of earlier Greek Revival poorhouses: a central five-bay 2-1/2 story main block was flanked by residential wings. This structure, however, includes Craftsman and Queen Anne details more typical of the late 19th century. The building exterior has only received modest alterations since its construction, the most notable being an addition to the west wing made by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Poor farms were a typical means by which communities provided for their indigent poor in the 19th century. This facility was established by the town in 1890, and originally included a wider array of agricultural buildings. The facility was operated as a farm until 1955, at which time the town sold of the agricultural equipment of the farm, and leased the agricultural land to local farmers. In 1974 the facility was formally named the \\"Town Lodging House\\".

In 1912, Oviatt and a colleague, hat salesman Frank Baird Alexander, launched their partnership in men's clothing as the Alexander & Oviatt haberdashery, at 209 West Fourth Street in downtown Los Angeles.. Their 'silent partner' was Frank Shaver Allen, a wealthy and once socially prominent architect whose career had been destroyed by a sex scandal several years earlier. During annual summer buying trips to Europe, Oviatt found stylish clothing to bring back to his prospering Los Angeles store. With the emergence of French Art Deco in the 1920s, Oviatt found the architectural style that would embody the interior design of his 1928 James Oviatt Building and its penthouse.http://www.saint- anthonys.org/archive/oviatt_building_history.pdf The Oviatt Building was designed by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Walker & Eisen.

Amazonian languages is the term used to refer to the indigenous languages of \\"Greater Amazonia.\\" This area is significantly larger than the Amazon and extends from the Atlantic coast all the way to the Andes, while its southern border is usually said to be the Paran√°. The region is inhabited by societies that share many cultural traits but whose languages are characterized by great diversity. There are about 330 extant languages in Greater Amazonia, almost half of which have fewer than 500 speakers. Meanwhile, only Wayuu has greater than 100,000 speakers (about 300,000). Of the 330 total languages, about fifty are isolates, while the remaining ones belong to about 25 different families. Most of the posited families have few members. It is this distribution of many small and historically unrelated speech communities that makes Amazonia one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. The precise reasons for this unusual diversity have not yet been conclusively determined, but Amazonian languages seem to have had fewer than 10,000 native speakers even before the invasion of European colonists wrought havoc on the societies by which they were spoken. Despite the large-scale diversity, the long-term contact among many of the languages of Greater Amazonia has created similarities between many neighboring languages that are not genetically related.Epps and Michael, 2015, p. 1 Most indigenous Amazonian people today are bilingual or even monolingual in Spanish or Portuguese, and many Amazonian languages are endangered as a result.  Linguistic diversity  The Arawak languages of South America, the second largest family of Amazonian languages. The dark blue shows Southern Arawak languages. Pano-Tacanan languages: Pano (dark green) and Takana (light green), the points indicating the documented localizations of the languages. A variety of macro-groupings have been suggested for the Amazonian languages families, like the one suggested by Joseph Greenberg; however, these theories are not widely supported.Aikhenvald, 2012 Often, similarities between languages are due to language contact rather than due to genetic relationship. This illustrates that a lack of contact between communities is not necessary to maintain linguistic diversity. A vast amount of linguistic research is presently being undertaken to better understand the relations between the languages of Greater Amazonia. Of the above-mentioned 25 or so language families, the following six are the major ones: * Tupian: consisting of 70-80 languages. The languages belonging to the largest sub-group, Tup√≠-Guaran√≠, are spoken almost across the entire northern half of South America. Their most prominent typological feature is an intricate system of person marking on verbs. * Macro-J√™: consisting of 30-40 languages, largely spoken in the southeast of the region, with some outliers closer to the Basin. The languages have unusually large vowel and unusually small consonant inventories. * Cariban: consisting of 40-50 languages. They are mostly found in the very north of South America, with some outliers closer to the Basin. * Arawakan: consisting of 70-80 languages. They cluster in the south, west and northwest of the region. Some important typological features are possession marking on nouns and split intransitivity based on verb type (active vs. stative). * Panoan: consisting of 30-40 languages, mostly in the south and southwest of the region. Some of their main characteristics are split alignment and complex switch reference systems. * Tukanoan: consisting of 20-30 languages, which are overwhelmingly spoken in the southern half of Colombia. The languages are known, amongst other things, for their extensive evidential and noun classifier systems. Multilingualism was (and is) the norm among Amazonian Indians. In fact, the value that many inhabitants of Amazonia assign to multilingualism is sometimes seen as a reason for the longevity of the linguistic diversity in the region.  History of the Amazonian villages  The majority of the Amazon Basin and the Orinoco are the lowlands of a tropical rainforest, rich in edible vegetables and animals. Archeologists estimate that this territory has been populated for less than 12,000 years. The entire population of the area would have arrived only a couple millennia ago. The principal source of protein is fish, supplemented by hunting pecaris, tapirs, rodents and monkeys. The domestication of plants, at first concentrated in the bitter yuca root, dates back 5,000 years. Agricultural expansion, with its version of slash and burn cultivation, began in the mountainsides of the western Andes and was brought to the majority of the main rivers in the Amazon. The villages based on hunting and gathering were pushed to the more inaccessible areas. Each linguistic group tends to share certain characteristics relative to the type of territory they occupy, the mode of production and the material culture. For example, practically all the ethnic groups of the Arawakan, Cariban, and Tupi families occupy areas of tropical rainforest, extensively use agriculture and make canoes, hammocks, and ceramics. On the other hand, the G√™ ethnic groups usually live in grasslands, have little agriculture and do not make canoes, hammocks, or ceramics. Nevertheless, they have a more complex social organization. Scattered among the farming villages, in the heart of the jungle, live hunter-gatherers that belong to minor language families, such as the Nadahup, Pirah√£ and Guajiboan families, more or less the direct descendants of the first hunter-gatherers. Some groups, especially the agriculturally based ones, have been particularly aggressive and are prone to attack their neighbours. Nevertheless, symbiotic relations exist between different groups: for example the Tucanoans, who are agricultural based, trade with the Nadahup, who are hunter-gatherers. The latter provide animal meat from the jungle and poison obtained from fish, and in exchange receive tapioca flour from the Tucanoan plantations, as well as ceramics. Even so, the Nadahup are considered \\"inferior\\" by the Tucanoans and are not considered in inter-ethnic marriage as the Tucanoans do with other ethnic groups. The Europeans invaded the region in the 16th century, quickly taking control of the coastal areas and the main rivers as far as they were navigable. The indigenous population began to drastically diminish around 1900; it is estimated that the population was only a 10th of what it had been in 1500 (estimated at between 2 and 5 million).R. M. Dixon (1999), p. 7 The majority of this loss of life was involuntary, due to European diseases the native Amazonian population didn't have immunity to. The Europeans also used the native Amazonians as slaves. There are testimonies of the Europeans navigating upriver from the mouth of the Amazon, capturing entire tribes and carrying them downriver to the plantations where they worked under difficult conditions, dying in a few years.Hemming, 1978. The Europeans, due to their superior weapons, were able to take whatever piece of land they wanted. Previously the incursions of the colonists were motivated by the possession of resources like rubber or certain minerals, that frequently were preceded by violent actions against the indigenous Amazonians.

Its position east of the range of Cadmus assigns it to Phrygia, under which country Strabo describes it. It was on the south side of the Maeander River, 20 miles west of Laodicea to Ephesus. The place is identified by hot springs approximately 12 miles northwest of Denizli, that have been described by the scholars Pococke and Chandler. Strabo observed that Carura contained many inns (), which is explained by the fact of its being on a line of great traffic, by which the wool and other products of the interior were transported to the coast. He added that it has hot springs, some in the Maeander, and some on the banks of the river. This tract of land is subject to earthquakes. In a story reported by Strabo, a brothel keeper was lodging in the inns with a great number of his women, they were all swallowed up one night by the earth opening. Henry William Chandler observed on the spot a jet of hot water, which sprung up several inches from the ground; and also the remains of an ancient bridge over the river. On the road between Carura and Laodicea was the temple of Men Carus, a Carian deity; and in the time of Strabo there was a noted Herophilean school of medicine here, under the presidency of Zeuxis, and then Alexander Philalethes.Strabo, p. 580 Chandler discovered some remains on the road to Laodicea, which, he supposes, may be the traces of this temple; but he states nothing that confirms this conjecture. Herodotus mentions a place called \\"Cydrara\\", to which Xerxes came on his road from Colossae to Sardes.Herodotus, vii. 30 It was the border between Lydia and Phrygia, and the Lydian king Croesus fixed a stele there with an inscription on it, which declared the boundary. Classical scholar William Martin Leake thought that the Cydrara of Herodotus may be Carura.William Martin Leake, Asia Minor p. 251 It could not be far off; but the boundary between Lydia and Phrygia should perhaps not be located south of the Maeander in this region. Modern scholars locate Carura near Tekke, in Asiatic Turkey.

Wrought in 1693.Coventry, p. 90 A yett (from the Old English and Scots language word for \\"gate\\") is a gate or grille of latticed wrought iron bars used for defensive purposes in castles and tower houses.Coventry, p. 10 Unlike a portcullis, which is raised and lowered vertically using mechanical means, yetts are hinged in the manner of a traditional gate or door, and secured by bolts attached to the yett, or by long bars drawn out from the wall or gateway.  Geographical distribution  St Michael's Church, Burgh by Sands, Cumbria Yett between the tower and the church at St Cuthbert's Church, Great Salkeld, Cumbria, viewed from inside the tower. Yetts are predominantly found in Scotland ‚Äì where most towers, particularly the later ones, were equipped with them rather than portcullisesMorris, p. 187 ‚Äì but some iron gates are found in the Border counties of England.Toy, p. 198 While few references to yetts exist outside Scotland, an English report of 1416 on Roxburgh Castle (then in English hands) contained recommendations for the insertion of iron gates. Yetts are not restricted to any one region or district within Scotland, but are widespread throughout.Christison (1883), p. 99 Similar grille constructions, frequently also referred to as yetts, were used in Scotland over windows and other openings.Coventry, p. 6 These were typically fixed in place, often set into the jambs, sills and lintels. Origins and use The earliest references to yetts date from the 14th century.Maxwell-Irving, p. 433 Exchequer Rolls from 1377 refer to a \\"fabricated iron gate\\", part of the defences for David's Tower in Edinburgh Castle.Maxwell-Irving, pp. 433‚Äì4 Yetts were also appearing in other castles at about the same time. Craigmillar, built soon after 1374, reputedly contained a yett, and Doune Castle (c. 1380) still retains its original double-leafed yett; a similar double-leafed yett is present at Balvenie, but its age is uncertain.Maxwell-Irving, p. 434. By the 15th century, yetts and window-grilles had become standard features within Scottish castles and towers. The yett was frequently used as cheaper alternative to the portcullis,Morris, p. 215 since it was simpler in concept, less cumbersome and more practical. However, it was also used within more complex defensive arrangements. The 14th-century castle at Doune, in Perthshire, had a portcullis in the main gateway supplemented by a yett, with a second yett at the far bailey end of the passage. The yetts each had two leaves, with a wicket gate inserted within one of the leaves.Toy, pp. 201‚Äì2 Commonly, the yett would be placed behind a wooden door, providing additional security should the outer door be burned. Being a defensive structure, royal warrants were required before a yett could be added to any house or castle. These were frequently issued with other licenses for defensive features; for example, in 1501 John Murray of Cockpool was given a licence to build a tower at Comlongon with machicolations and \\"irneztteis and windois\\". Aggressors might attempt to remove yetts: in February 1489 the Hepburns in Stirlingshire brought an action against the Grahams who had taken away the iron yett of Bruce's Tower in order to gain possession.Acts of the Lord Auditors, (1839), 132; see RCAHMS Stirlingshire, Bruce's Tower or Over Carnock Following the Union of the Crowns in 1603, efforts were made by the government to control the disorder and reiving in the borders. In November 1606 it was recognised that one of the impediments to the administration of justice in the area was the strength of the houses. Consequently, the Privy Council ordered that all yetts should be removed from all houses belonging to those lower in rank than barons. Construction In Scotland, yetts were traditionally made using a \\"through and through\\" construction, with both horizontal and vertical bars either woven alternatively around or through each other, creating a structure almost impossible to dismantle. The grille was left open.Toy, p. 201 The usual method was to build the yett in quadrants with all the bars in a quadrant passing either vertically or horizontally through the mating bars as shown in the photograph. This method of construction for gates is not seen outside Scotland, although window grilles constructed in this manner are found in northern Italy and Tyrol. Grated windows in the Scottish style were traditional in Tyrol in the 15th century, and similar window grilles are seen a century later in Venice, particularly the 16th century Palazzo Ducale (although the bars are somewhat larger than those used in Scotland).Maxwell- Irving, pp. 435, 438 It is likely the craft spread south from Tyrol to the Venetian Republic, but little apparent connection to the earlier Scottish technology, although there was some trade between Scotland and Germany. Grated iron doors were found in England, but were constructed using a different method. For the English-style gate, the vertical bars all passed in front of the horizontal bars, and were riveted or fixed in place; the spaces were infilled with oak, making the gate solid. One notable exception, however, is constructed using the Scottish method: a yett from Streatlam Castle, now held at the Bowes Museum in nearby Barnard Castle. Streatlam was rebuilt by Sir George Bowes following damage in the 16th century; the Bowes family had connections in Scotland, which may have inspired the yett construction.Maxwell-Irving, pp. 435‚Äì7 Since yetts were immensely heavy, and there is little evidence to suggest they were prefabricated, it is possible that many were made locally rather than transported large distances, either by local smiths or itinerant specialists.Maxwell-Irving, p. 448 However, the yetts and window grilles of Scottish royal palaces were made to measure in the smithy of the royal artillery at Edinburgh Castle and transported to houses like Falkland Palace, Hamilton Palace and Linlithgow Palace,Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10, (1913), 61, February 1552. and some for Stirling Castle were made in Linlithgow.Accounts of the Masters of Work, 1, HMSO (1957), 218‚Äì219: Treasurer's Accounts, vol. 8, HM Register House, 37, November 1541 Conventionally, window-grilles were built into the stone window- frames. Costs Some price data for the comparative cost of yetts survive in old accounts. In 1515, Robert Scott, smith, his brother and workman were paid ¬£8-8s Scots for working yetts for Hume Castle. The iron itself cost ¬£17-6s with ¬£1 worth of coal.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (1903), 34, 37, 38. Records show that a yett constructed in 1568 for Kilravock Castle by a local smith weighed 34 stone, 3 lb, and cost ¬£34-3s-9d and \\"three bolls meal, ane stane butter, and ane stane cheese.\\" NotesReferences * Christison, David (1883) \\"On the Grated Iron doors of Scottish Castles and Towers\\", The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. 17, pp. 98‚Äì135 * Christison, David (1888) \\"Additional notice of yetts, or grated iron doors, of Scottish castles and towers\\", The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. 22, pp. 286‚Äì320 * HM Paton ed., Accounts of the Masters of Works for building Scottish Royal Castles, Vol.i, HMSO (1957) * Coventry, Martin (2001) The Castles of Scotland, 3rd Ed.

Biography Marvin Kent was born in Ravenna, Ohio, and was heavily involved in the business dealings of his father Zenas Kent from a very young age. During the 1860s he was instrumental in establishing the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and having the railroad shops located in the village of Franklin Mills.

Relatives Kent's father Zenas had several business ventures during the 1830s-1850s in Franklin Mills and briefly operated a tannery with John Brown. He also had considerable land holdings and built a four-story commercial block in what is now downtown Kent in 1837 that was said to have been the tallest building in Ohio at the time.

Located geographically at the center of the city, Downtown began its development with the completion of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad in 1882. Today the Downtown core is noted as the center of business for the Roanoke Valley and Southwest Virginia, the Roanoke City Market, the Roanoke Downtown Historic District and many other attractions and amenities. Location Geographically, downtown Roanoke is defined by the city as the area bound by Interstate 581 on the east, 5th Street to the west, the Norfolk and Western railroad tracks to the north and Day Avenue to the south. This area is the location of the central core and the historic Market District. An additional section of downtown is located south of Day Avenue, bound to the east by the Roy L. Webber Expressway, South Jefferson Street to the west and Albemarle Avenue to the south. This area is the location of the former Carilion Community Hospital and the Jefferson College of Health Sciences. Downtown borders the neighborhoods of the West End on the west, Belmont on the east, Gainsboro on the north and both Old Southwest and South Jefferson on the south. History The initial establishment of the Gainesborough in 1835 was located to the northeast of present-day downtown. The first structures constructed in what is now downtown occurred in the period following the completion of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad line in 1852 to the south of Gainesborough. Now known as Big Lick, during the period of reconstruction following the American Civil War, the rail infrastructure was restored and the first municipal structure completed in present-day downtown was a jail. By 1881 the Shenandoah Valley Railroad announced that Big Lick would be the southern terminus of its line resulting in the rapid growth and development of the community. With the arrival of the railroad, Big Lick would incorporate as the city of Roanoke in 1882. The rapid growth resulted in the citizens passing a $90,000 bond in 1886 to provide for the infrastructure to support the growing community. With the adequate infrastructure in place, downtown would see a rapid expansion from the area around the present-day Campbell Avenue/Jefferson Street intersection outward. During the period between the wars, Downtown would continue to prosper and expand outwards. Many new structures were constructed in a variety of contemporary styles. Some of the notable structures completed during this period include the nine-story Boxley Building in 1921, the eleven-story Patrick Henry Hotel in 1925 and the twelve- story Colonial National Bank in 1927, which stood as the city's tallest through the 1970s. The downtown core would continue to see growth and prosperity through the period immediately following World War II and into the 1950s. With the opening of Crossroads Mall in 1961, more shops would close their Downtown doors, with more people choosing to shop outside the city center. Although declining as a retail destination, the 1970s saw a construction boom resulting in a reshaping of the skyline. Both the thirteen- story Crestar Bank Building (now the BB&T; Bank Building) and the sixteen- story First National Exchange Bank Building (now the Carilion Administrative Services Building) were completed in 1973 and the fourteen-story Poff Federal Building was completed in 1976, with each still prominent features of the downtown cityscape. Established in 1882, the Roanoke City Market is the oldest continuously operating farmers market in the Commonwealth of Virginia and forms the central gathering place of the Downtown district. By the 1960s the market would begin to decline, hitting its low point in the 1970s. Seen as the key to the revitalization of Downtown, the Design 79 plan was initiated to stimulate the revitalization and redevelopment of the market area. Through its and subsequent plans implementation, the market area was revitalized with the efforts now expanding outside the market area throughout Downtown. By the early 1990s Downtown would again be reshaped with the completion of both the 21-story Dominion Tower (now the Wells Fargo Tower) in 1991 as the city's tallest structure and the twelve-story Norfolk Southern Building in 1992. By the early 2000s (decade) downtown would experience the conversion of many former office buildings, stores and warehouses into residential living units.

Her World War II career was short due to the war coming to an end, and she was inactivated only to be commissioned again some time later as a tender for salvage craft. Construction and career The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Naubuc was laid down on 31 December 1943 with the identification number YN‚Äì109 by the Marine Iron and Shipbuilding Co., Duluth, Minnesota. The ship was launched on 15 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Harold E. Ford; and commissioned on 15 March 1945, Lt. (jg.) W. M. Bauer in command with the identification number AN-84.  World War II related service  Following a delayed shakedown off the U.S. East Coast, Naubuc departed Boston, Massachusetts on 24 April 1945, en route to California. Arriving at San Pedro, California on 7 June, she completed intensive net training drills and headed west, anchoring in Pearl Harbor 17 July. By 1 August she was at Eniwetok, whence she continued on to the Philippines, performing her specialized services of laying and tending protective nets around ships arid across harbor entrances at Leyte until after the cessation of hostilities. Encoute to CONUS in October, she stopped at Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Francisco, California, 1 December. On completion of an abbreviated tour in the Panama Canal Zone, Naubus reported at San Diego, California, 2 January 1946, for duty in the 11th Naval District.  Post-war inactivation  Ordered to Seattle, Washington, for inactivation the following month, she decommissioned and entered the 19th Fleet, at Astoria, Oregon, 6 September 1946. She remained in the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, until struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 September 1962. She was then transferred to the custody of the U.S. Maritime Administration and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.  Reinstatement as a tender  Reacquired five years later, Naubuc was reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1967 arid scheduled to be converted to a Salvage Craft Tender. In March 1968 she was reclassified (ARST‚Äì4) and assigned to the 13th Naval District for conversion.  Cable laying/implantment vessel During conversion Naubuc was essentially rebuilt. All original propulsion and steering machinery was removed and the ship reequipped for precise navigation and station keeping. Propulsion and steering was by means of four 12-cylinder diesel engines that powered four rotating thrusters mounted on vertical shafts. She was configured as a cable laying and implantment vessel with a cable drum located in the bow along with a cable guide going over the stern. The four thrusters allowed the vessel to stay \\"on station\\". When underway, however, only the two bow or stern thrusters were operated at any one time. The vertical thruster shafts increased the vessel's draft significantly. The thrusters were easily damaged by impact with the bottom. The conversion radically changed the outward appearance of the vessel and the length was shortened to with 873 tons displacement. The vessel was put into service by the Military Sealift Command as USNS Naubuc operated under contract with the Navy's Supervisor of Salvage by Merritt Division of Pacific Marine Salvage Company assigned to Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC). Naubuc was assigned to implant and lay cable off Bermuda for the Long Range Acoustic Propagation Project (LRAPP) Test Bed three dimensional suspended array that took place in December 1970. The array reused components of the earlier unsuccessful Sea Spider acoustic experiment array that was attempted in 1969 north of Hawaii in the Pacific. The Bermuda array reused Sea Spider components and was essentially the same trapezoidal taut cable configuration anchored in of water with the horizontal component suspended below the surface. The Test Bed array was successfully planted but it was not successful due to cable shorts caused by twisting and kinking of the cable to shore. During the summer of 1971 the vessel supported CURV III in recovery of inoperative underwater acoustic array towers of the Azores Fixed Acoustic Range (AFAR) in the Azores off Santa Maria Island. Naubuc was last used as a support vessel for a cable underwater recovery vehicle in the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros Island.  Final decommissioning  On 1 September 1975 Naubuc was struck from the Navy List and sold by Navy Sale.

DH is a cutaneous manifestation of Coeliac disease. DH is neither related to nor caused by herpes virus: the name means that it is a skin inflammation having an appearance similar to herpes. Dermatitis herpetiformis was first described by Louis Adolphus Duhring in 1884. A connection between DH and Coeliac disease was recognized in 1967, although the exact causal mechanism is not known. The age of onset is usually about 15‚Äì40, but DH also may affect children and the elderly. Men are slightly more affected than women. Estimates of DH prevalence vary from 1 in 400 to 1 in 10,000. It is most common in patients of northern European and northern Indian ancestry, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 along with coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.  Signs and symptoms  Its characteristic rash resembles herpes and is the basis of its clinical name Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by intensely itchy, chronic papulovesicular eruptions, usually distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces (buttocks, back of neck, scalp, elbows, knees, back, hairline, groin, or face). The blisters vary in size from very small up to 1 cm across. The condition is extremely itchy, and the desire to scratch may be overwhelming. This sometimes causes the sufferer to scratch the blisters off before they are examined by a physician. Intense itching or burning sensations are sometimes felt before the blisters appear in a particular area. The signs and symptoms of DH typically appear around 30 to 40 years of age, although all ages may be affected. Although the first signs and symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis are intense itching and burning, the first visible signs are the small papules or vesicles that usually look like red bumps or blisters. The rash rarely occurs on other mucous membranes, excepting the mouth or lips. The symptoms range in severity from mild to serious, but they are likely to disappear if gluten ingestion is avoided and appropriate treatment is administered. Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms are chronic, and they tend to come and go, mostly in short periods of time in response to the amount of gluten ingested. Sometimes, these symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of coeliac disease, which typically include abdominal pain, bloating or loose stool, weight loss, and fatigue. However, individuals with DH often have no gastrointestinal symptoms even if they have associated intestinal damage. The rash caused by dermatitis herpetiformis forms and disappears in three stages. In the first stage, the patient may notice a slight discoloration of the skin at the site where the lesions appear. In the next stage, the skin lesions transform into obvious vesicles and papules that are likely to occur in groups. Healing of the lesions is the last stage of the development of the symptoms, usually characterized by a change in the skin color. This may result in areas of the skin turning darker or lighter than the color of the skin on the rest of the body. Because of the intense itching, patients usually scratch, which may lead to the formation of crusts. Pathophysiology Cross- reactivity hypothesis for the onset of dermatitis herpetiformis in people with celiac disease In terms of pathology, the first signs of the condition may be observed within the dermis. The changes that may take place at this level may include edema, vascular dilatation, and cellular infiltration. It is common for lymphocytes and eosinophils to be seen. The bullae found in the skin affected by dermatitis herpetiformis are subepidermal and have rounded lateral borders. When looked at under the microscope, the skin affected by dermatitis herpetiformis presents a collection of neutrophils. They have an increased prevalence in the areas where the dermis is closest to the epidermis. Direct IMF studies of uninvolved skin show IgA in the dermal papillae and patchy granular IgA along the basement membrane. The jejunal mucosa may show partial villous atrophy, but the changes tend to be milder than in coeliac disease. Immunological studies revealed findings that are similar to those of coeliac disease in terms of autoantigens. The main autoantigen of dermatitis herpetiformis is epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), a cytosolic enzyme involved in cell envelope formation during keratinocyte differentiation. Various research studies have pointed out different potential factors that may play a larger or smaller role in the development of dermatitis herpetiformis. The fact that eTG has been found in precipitates of skin-bound IgA from skin affected by this condition has been used to conclude that dermatitis herpetiformis may be caused by a deposition of both IgA and eTG within the dermis. It is estimated that these deposits may resorb after ten years of following a gluten-free diet. Moreover, it is suggested that this condition is closely linked to genetics. This theory is based on the arguments that individuals with a family history of gluten sensitivity who still consume foods containing gluten are more likely to develop the condition as a result of the formation of antibodies to gluten. These antibodies cross-react with eTG, and IgA/eTG complexes deposit within the papillary dermis to cause the lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis. These IgA deposits may disappear after long-term (up to ten years) avoidance of dietary gluten. Gliadin proteins in gluten are absorbed by the gut and enter the lamina propria where they need to be deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). tTG modifies gliadin into a more immunogenic peptide. Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) endocytose the immunogenic peptide and if their pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger- associated molecular pattern (DAMPs), the danger signal will influence them to secrete IL-8 (CXCL8) in the lamina propria, recruiting neutrophils. Neutrophil recruitment results in a very rapid onset of inflammation. Therefore, co- infection with microbes that carry PAMPs may be necessary for the initial onset of symptoms in gluten sensitivity, but would not be necessary for successive encounters with gluten due to the production of memory B and memory T cells (discussed below). Dermatitis herpetiformis may be characterised based on inflammation in the skin and gut. Inflammation in the gut is similar to, and linked to, celiac disease. tTG is treated as an autoantigen, especially in people with certain HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles and other gene variants that cause atopy. tTG is up-regulated after gluten absorption. cDCs endocytose tTG- modified gliadin complexes or modified gliadin alone but they only present gliadin to CD4+ T cells on pMHC-II complexes. These T cells become activated and polarised into type I helper T (Th1) cells. Th1 cells reactive towards gliadin have been discovered, but none against tTG. A naive B cell sequesters tTG-modified gliadin complexes from the surface of cDCs in the lymph nodes (LNs) before they become endocytosed by the cDCs. The B cell receptor (membrane bound antibody; BCR) is specific to the tTG portion of the complex. The B cell endocytoses the complex and presents the modified gliadin to the activated Th1 cell's T cell receptor (TCR) via pMHC-II in a process known as epitope spreading. Thus, the B cell presents the foreign peptide (modified gliadin) but produces antibodies specific for the self-antigen (tTG). Once the B cell becomes activated, it differentiates into plasma cells that secrete autoantibodies against tTG, which may be cross-reactive with epidermal transglutanimase (eTG). Class A antibodies (IgA) deposit in the gut. Some may bind to the CD89 (FcŒ±RI) receptor on macrophages (M1) via their Fc region (constant region). This will trigger endocytosis of the tTG-IgA complex, resulting in the activation of macrophages. Macrophages secrete more IL-8, propagating the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response. The purportedly cross-reactive autoantibodies may migrate to the skin in dermatitis herpetiformis. IgA deposits may form if the antibodies cross-react with epidermal transglutanimase (eTG). Some patients have eTG-specific antibodies instead of tTG-specific cross-reactive antibodies and the relationship between dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease in these patients is not fully understood. Macrophages may be stimulated to secrete IL-8 by the same process as is seen in the gut, causing neutrophils to accumulate at sites of high eTG concentrations in the dermal papillae of the skin. Neutrophils produce pus in the dermal papillae, generating characteristic blisters. IL-31 accumulation at the blisters may intensify itching sensations. Memory B and T cells may become activated in the absence of PAMPs and DAMPs during successive encounters with tTG-modified gliadin complexes or modified gliadin alone, respectively. Symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis are often resolved if patients avoid a gluten-rich diet.  Diagnosis  Dermatitis herpetiformis often is misdiagnosed, being confused with drug eruptions, contact dermatitis, dishydrotic eczema (dyshidrosis), and even scabies. Other diagnoses in the differential diagnosis include bug bites and other blistering conditions such as bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. Micrograph of dermatitis herpetiformis: Subepidermal vesicles, with papillary neutrophil microabcesses, with neutrophil, eosinophil and lymphocytes infi ltrates in the superfi cial dermis. However, the histopathology is unspecific in approximately 35%‚Äì40% of the cases, and direct immunofluorescence is needed, showing deposition of IgA in the papillary dermis in a granular or fibrillar pattern. Last Update: July 11, 2019. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a simple blood test for IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (which cross-react with epidermal transglutaminase), and by a skin biopsy in which the pattern of IgA deposits in the dermal papillae, revealed by direct immunofluorescence, distinguishes it from linear IgA bullous dermatosis and other forms of dermatitis. Additionally, the concomitant diagnosis of Celiac disease can be made without the need for a small-intenstinal biopsy if an individual has biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis as well as supporting serologic studies (elevated levels of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies, IgA epidermal transglutaminase antibodies, or IgA endomysial antibodies). These tests should be performed before the patient starts on a gluten-free diet, otherwise they might produce false negatives. As with ordinary celiac disease, IgA against transglutaminase disappears (often within months) when patients eliminate gluten from their diet. Thus, for both groups of patients, it may be necessary to restart gluten for several weeks before testing may be done reliably. In 2010, Cutis reported an eruption labelled gluten-sensitive dermatitis which is clinically indistinguishable from dermatitis herpetiformis, but lacks the IgA connection, similar to gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking coeliac disease but without the diagnostic immunological markers.  Treatment = First-line therapy  A strict gluten-free diet must be followed, and usually, this treatment will be a lifelong requirement. Avoidance of gluten will reduce any associated intestinal damage and the risk of other complications. It can be very difficult to maintain a strict gluten-free diet, however, as contamination with gluten is common in many supposedly gluten-free foods and restaurants. Dapsone is an effective initial treatment in most people and is the initial drug of choice to alleviate the rash and itching. Itching is typically reduced within 2‚Äì3 days, however, dapsone treatment has no effect on any intestinal damage that might be present. After some time on a gluten-free diet, the dosage of dapsone usually may be reduced or even stopped, although this may take many years. Dapsone is an antibacterial, and its role in the treatment of DH, which is not caused by bacteria, is poorly understood. It may cause adverse effects, especially hemolytic anemia, so regular blood monitoring is required.  Alternative treatment options  For individuals with DH unable to tolerate dapsone for any reason, alternative treatment options may include the following: * colchicine * lymecycline * nicotinamide * tetracycline * sulfamethoxypyridazine * sulfapyridine Combination therapy with nicotinamide and tetracyclines has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in some individuals who cannot tolerate dapsone or live in places where dapsone is not readily available. While the mechanism of action of tetracyclines and nicotinamide in DH is unknown, it is speculated to be due to their immune- modulating effects. Topical steroid medications are also sometimes used in combination with dapsone and a gluten-free diet to alleviate the itchiness associated with the rash. A new therapeutic vaccine (Nexvax2) for celiac disease is currently being developed and could potentially prove efficacious to individuals with dermatitis herpetiformis who have the HLA-DQ2 haplotype. The vaccine contains three fragments, or epitopes, commonly found on gluten that are thought to be responsible for the pro-inflammatory response in patients with celiac disease. By introducing these epitopes to the immune system, the vaccine aims to induce immune tolerance to gluten via introduction of progressively higher doses of the vaccine over time. As of January 4, 2019 the vaccine has entered phase 2 trials to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in individuals with celiac disease who are given a gluten-challenge test. On June 25, 2019, the phase 2 trial was terminated. The results did not demonstrate protection from gluten exposure when compared to a placebo. Prognosis Dermatitis herpetiformis generally responds well to medication and a strict gluten-free diet. It is an autoimmune disease, however, and thus individuals with DH are more likely to develop other autoimmune conditions such as thyroid disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, lupus erythematosus, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata. There has been an association of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in individuals who have dermatitis herpetiformis, although this risk decreases to less than the population risk with a strict gluten-free diet. Dermatitis herpetiformis does not usually cause complications on its own, without being associated with another condition. Complications from this condition, however, arise from the autoimmune character of the disease, as an overreacting immune system is a sign that something does not work well and might cause problems to other parts of the body that do not necessarily involve the digestive system. Gluten intolerance and the body's reaction to it make the disease more worrying in what concerns the possible complications. This means that complications that may arise from dermatitis herpetiformis are the same as those resulting from coeliac disease, which include osteoporosis, certain kinds of gut cancer, and an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease. The risks of developing complications from dermatitis herpetiformis decrease significantly if the affected individuals follow a gluten-free diet.  Epidemiology  Global estimates of the prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis range from 1 in 400 to 1 in 10,000 people. Individuals of Northern European descent are most likely to be affected and estimates of the rates of DH in British and Finnish populations range from 30 in 100,000 to 75 in 100,000 people, respectively. The annual incidence rate of DH in these populations range from 0.8 to 2.7 per 100,000. People of all ages may be affected, although the mean age at diagnosis varies between 30‚Äì40 years of age. There is a slight male predominance in DH for unknown reasons and it is associated with celiac disease and the haplotypes HLA-DQ2 and, less commonly, HLA-DQ8. Notable cases It has been suggested that French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat had DH, leading him to spend much of his time in, and even work from, a bathtub filled with a herbal mixture that he used as a palliative for the sores.

The term is also applied to the outer layer of the dura mater in human anatomy.The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, 2004. Houghton Mifflin Company, USA Structure Structurally, the endocranium consists of a boxlike shape, open at the top. The posterior margin exhibit the foramen magnum, an opening for the spinal cord. The floor of the endocranium has several paired openings for the cranial nerves, and the anterior margin holds a spongy construction, allowing for the external nasal nerves to pass through.Romer, A.S. & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985) All bones of the structure derive from the cranial neural crest during fetal development. Endocranial elements in humans In humans and other mammals, the endocranium forms during fetal development as a cartilaginous neurocranium, that ossifies from several centers.Kent, G.C & Miller, L. (1997): Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates. Wm. C. Brown Publishers. . Several of these bones merge, and in the adult primates (including humans), the endocranium is composed of only five bony elements (from front to back):Colbert, E.H. & Morales, M. (2001): Colbert's Evolution of the Vertebrates: A History of the Backboned Animals Through Time. 4th edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York - . * The Ethmoid bone, lying behind the nose. * The Sphenoid bone, underlying the forward portion of the brain * Paired petrous part of the temporal bones, containing the inner ear structures * The Occipital bone, surrounding the foramen magnum Other animals=Endocranial components in other tetrapods The endocranium in mammals is much reduced in relative size and number of bones compared to the condition in the ancestral land vertebrates, though the occipital bone occur as one or more stout bony elements in several mammal groups. The occipital bone is also found as several bony elements in birds and reptiles, while the skull of modern amphibians is generally reduced with a simplified endocranium. The skull of early labyrinthodonts were rather complex, and contained in addition to the bones mentioned above several small cartilaginous components that are fused to temporal and occipital bones in mammals: * Paired prootic and opisthotic bones above each fenestra ovalis, fused to the petrous part of the temporal bones in mammals. * Paired exoccipital bones medially and a single basioccipital bone below the foramen magnum, part of the occipital bone in mammals. The endocranium in fish The loosely connected skull of a perch. While the endocranium is an integral part of the skull in mammals, birds and reptiles, its connection to the roofing parts of the skull is more loose in the lower vertebrates. In Agnathans and Chondrichthyes, the skull lacks the skull roof dermal elements, their whole cranium being composed of the endocranium, properly called a chondrocranium. In most Osteichthyes, the skull is only loosely joined, and the endocranial elements do not form a unit with the skull roof. Fossilization An endocast or endocranial cast is a cast made of the mold formed by the impression the brain makes on the inside of the neurocranium (braincase), providing a replica of the brain with most of the details of its outer surface. Endocasts can also form naturally, when sediments fill the empty skull, after which the skull is destroyed and the cast fossilized. Scientists are increasingly utilizing computerized tomography scanning technology to create digital endocasts without damaging valuable specimens. This gives a 3D representation of the brain. Brain size and complexity can then be determined. Endocasts were used for looking at the brains of Homo sapiens to find hemispheric specialization.

The highway begins at US 40 near exit 14 on Interstate 68 (I-68) and runs eastward to Cumberland, where it ends at exit 44 on I-68. Alt US 40 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The highway is known as National Pike because it follows the original alignment of the historic National Road. As a result, there are many historic sites along Alt US 40, including the Casselman Bridge in Grantsville and the last remaining National Road toll gate house in Maryland, located in LaVale. When the National Freeway was built in western Maryland paralleling the old National Road, parts of US 40 were bypassed. The part of the bypassed road between Keyser's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US 40, and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became Maryland Route 144 (MD 144) and U.S. Route 40 Scenic. Although Alt US 40 has diminished in importance from its original status as the National Road with the construction of I-68, it remains an important route for local traffic and serves as the Main Streets of Grantsville and Frostburg. Route description Alt US 40 runs from Keyser's Ridge to Cumberland, following part of the route of the National Road through some of Maryland's most mountainous terrain in Garrett and Allegany counties. The highway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from the eastern junction with MD 36 in Frostburg to the intersection of Mechanic Street and Henderson Avenue in Cumberland. Garrett County Alt US 40 branches from US 40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It runs parallel to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual average daily traffic (AADT)‚Äîthat is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged over the course of one year‚Äîis 1,831 at the western end of Alt US 40\\\\. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt US 40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt US 40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on Alt US 40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt US 40 meets MD 669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets MD 495, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward Oakland. East of Grantsville, Alt US 40 passes over the Casselman River on a steel bridge built in 1933. Downstream from this bridge is the Casselman River Bridge State Park, centered on the stone arch bridge which originally carried the National Road over the Casselman River. The Alt US 40 bridge over the Casselman River in Grantsville Continuing eastward from Grantsville, Alt US 40 intersects US 219 a short distance north of exit 22 on I-68, where US 219 leaves the freeway. East of this intersection, traffic decreases, with an AADT of 1,681, the lowest traffic density along the entire route. The US 219 intersection is at the top of a hill known as Chestnut Ridge. East of Chestnut Ridge, the highway passes over Meadow Mountain at a height of . In eastern Garrett County, traffic on the route gradually increases to an AADT of 2,232. Alt US 40 passes under MD 546, which runs north from I-68, through Finzel, to the Pennsylvania border. Although Alt US 40 does not directly intersect MD 546, it is connected to MD 546 by way of access road MD 546F, and also by MD 946, which intersects Alt US 40 near the top of Little Savage Mountain. Just east, the route crosses the larger Big Savage Mountain at an elevation of before entering Allegany County. Allegany County After continuing into Allegany County, Alt US 40 descends Savage Mountain into Frostburg, where it passes through the town as Main Street. Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route, with an AADT of 15,022. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20,931. In west Frostburg, the highway intersects MD 36, which then follows the same road as Alt US 40 for about a mile, separating from Alt US 40 in east Frostburg. In central Frostburg, Main Street intersects MD 936, an old alignment of MD 36. Continuing eastward from Frostburg, traffic density decreases, to an AADT of 13,585 at the MD 55 intersection, staying between 13,000 and 15,000 for the remainder of the highway. Alt US 40 passes through Eckhart Mines, where it intersects MD 638, which connects with MD 36 north of Frostburg. In the eastern part of Eckhart Mines, the highway intersects MD 743, which is an old alignment of US 40 which was bypassed by the roadway which became Alt US 40. Alt US 40 passing through the Narrows in Cumberland East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US 40 passes through Clarysville, where it intersects MD 55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain followed by Alt US 40 changes: from Clarysville westward to the summit of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD 55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, is located on the hillside above Alt US 40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US 40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD 53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. Alt US 40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD 53 and MD 658, which intersects Alt US 40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD 53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD 658. East of the intersection with MD 658, Alt US 40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD 49). View west from the east end of US 40 Alt. at I-68/US 40/US 220 in Cumberland Northeast of LaVale, Alt US 40 intersects MD 36 at the northern terminus of MD 36. Alt US 40 then passes through the Narrows, a gap between Haystack Mountain and Wills Mountain carved by Wills Creek, into Cumberland, where it follows Henderson Avenue and Baltimore Avenue to exit 44 on I-68, where Alt US 40 ends. The roadway continues eastward as MD 639. History The roadway which became Alt US 40 in Garrett and Allegany counties is, with some realignments, the route followed by the National Road through western Maryland. Various historic sites associated with the National Road can be found along Alt US 40, including a toll-gate house (La Vale Tollgate House) and mile-marker in LaVale. The toll-gate house in LaVale is the last remaining toll-gate house on the National Road in Maryland. Several historic bridges from the National Road, since bypassed by newer bridges, are still present along the route of Alt US 40, including the Casselman Bridge over the Casselman River in Grantsville and a bridge in Clarysville. Braddock Road and the National Road Alt US 40 in Garrett County In 1755, during the French and Indian War, British troops under the command of General Edward Braddock completed the arduous task of building a road westward from Fort Cumberland. They largely followed an Indian trail known as Nemacolin's Path, expanding it to a road using only hand tools. The road construction was part of the Braddock Expedition, which was the British campaign to seize Fort Duquesne from the French and Indian forces. Although the military expedition was a failure, the road continued to be used afterwards. However, with little maintenance being done on the road, it decayed over time until by the early nineteenth century little remained of the road. The route followed by Alt US 40 today is very similar to the route followed by Braddock's Road, with the exceptions of various realignments that have been done to the road over the years. For example, Braddock's Road crossed directly over Haystack Mountain west of Cumberland rather than following the Cumberland Narrows as later roads did. The National Road, the first road funded by the U.S. federal government, was authorized by the United States Congress in 1806, and ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US 40, in particular the LaVale toll gate house, built in 1836. Following the completion of the National Road in 1837, the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road, and toll gate houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is the first of its kind to be built along the National Road, and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland. The LaVale toll house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Realignments Multiple realignments of the road that is now Alt US 40 have occurred since it was originally built as the National Road. Most such realignments are minor, such as to bypass an old bridge, but some have significantly affected the path of the road. One such realignment occurred in 1834, when a new route for the National Road was built through the Cumberland Narrows. The previous route had followed the Braddock Road, a route which is now followed by MD 49. The route following Braddock Road passed over Haystack Mountain and was much steeper than the newer route through the Narrows. The route through the Narrows allowed the road to bypass this steep mountain ascent. The stone arch bridge built across Will's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932, when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will's Creek replaced it. The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will's Creek flood control system in the 1950s. Another realignment of Alt US 40 occurred in Eckhart Mines, where in 1969 the road, then designated as US 40, was realigned to the north, bypassing the section of the highway through Eckhart Mines, which has a lower speed limit and sharp curves. The speed limit on the old alignment is , and the new alignment has a speed limit of along most of the bypass. The new alignment intersects the old alignment, designated as MD 743, on the east end between MD 638 and MD 55\\\\. The west end of the old alignment meets MD 36 just south of its intersection with Alt US 40\\\\. MD 638, which prior to the realignment ended at US 40, was not truncated, and thus ends at MD 743. Historic bridges The Casselman River Bridge as it appeared in 1979 There are several historic bridges along the National Road that are still present near the current route of Alt US 40\\\\. Among them are the Casselman River bridge in Grantsville, and the bridge over Braddock Run, a tributary of Wills Creek, in Clarysville. The original National Road bridge over the Casselman River was a stone arch bridge constructed in 1813. The span was built to be the largest bridge of its type in the United States at the time, and during its construction it was believed that the bridge could not stand on its own. The bridge was constructed in this manner in the hopes that the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal would eventually pass under it, though construction on the canal was stopped at Cumberland in 1850. When US 40 was first designated in 1925, it crossed the Casselman River on the original stone bridge. In 1933, a new steel bridge was constructed to replace the National Road bridge, and it is this bridge that Alt US 40 now follows. The original bridge was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and is now part of the Casselman River Bridge State Park. Another historic bridge stands in Clarysville, near the intersection of Alt US 40 and MD 55\\\\. This bridge, which crosses Braddock Run, was built in 1812, with later work being done in 1843. The stone arch bridge, located just south of the current alignment of Alt US 40, was restored in 1976. Origins of Alt US 40 Prior to the construction of I-68, US 40 followed the route currently designated as U.S. Route 40 Alternate. The first segment of what would become I-68 was built in Cumberland in the mid-1960s. The freeway, first designated as US 48, was extended westward through the 1970s, reaching West Virginia in 1976. The portions of US 40 that were bypassed between Cumberland and Keysers Ridge became U.S. Route 40 Alternate, which first appeared on MDSHA maps in the early 1980s. At this time, US 40 was realigned to follow the US 48 freeway, sharing the freeway with US 48. In 1991 the freeway was completed from Hancock to Morgantown, West Virginia. The US 48 designation was retired, and on August 2, 1991, the freeway became I-68.

Dogs, cats, small rodents, horses, and primates all lick wounds. Saliva contains tissue factor which promotes the blood clotting mechanism. The enzyme lysozyme is found in many tissues and is known to attack the cell walls of many gram-positive bacteria, aiding in defense against infection. Tears are also beneficial to wounds due to the lysozyme enzyme. However, there are also infection risks due to bacteria in the mouth. Mechanism A dog licking a wounded paw Oral mucosa heals faster than skin, suggesting that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived tissue factor, and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary tissue factor, associated with microvesicles shed from cells in the mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing.Kate Wong: A Protein's Healing Powers. Scientific American 2 October 2000 Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, VEGF, TGF-Œ≤1, leptin, IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-Œ± induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area. In a recent study, scientists have confirmed through several experiments that the protein responsible for healing properties in human saliva is, in fact, histatin. Scientists are now looking for ways to make use of this information in ways that can lead to chronic wounds, burns, and injuries being healed by saliva.Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. \\"Licking Your Wounds: Scientists Isolate Compound In Human Saliva That Speeds Wound Healing.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 24 July 2008. In animals A cat with an Elizabethan collar Lick granuloma from excessive licking It has been long observed that the licking of their wounds by dogs might be beneficial. Indeed, a dog's saliva is bactericidal against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis, although not against coagulase-positive Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Wound licking is also important in other animals. Removal of the salivary glands of mice and rats slows wound healing, and communal licking of wounds among rodents accelerates wound healing. Communal licking is common in several primate species. In macaques, hair surrounding a wound and any dirt is removed, and the wound is licked, healing without infection. Risks Wound licking is beneficial but too much licking can be harmful. An Elizabethan collar may be used on pet animals to prevent them from biting an injury or excessively licking it, which can cause a lick granuloma. These lesions are often infected by pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus intermedius. Horses that lick wounds may become infected by a stomach parasite, Habronema, a type of nematode worm. The rabies virus may be transmitted between animals, such as the kudu antelopes by wound licking of wounds with residual infectious saliva. In humans=Legend There are many legends involving healing wounds by licking them or applying saliva. Saint Magdalena de Pazzi is said to have cured a nun of sores and scabs in 1589 by licking her limbs. The Roman Emperor Vespasian is said to have performed a healing of a blind man using his saliva. Pliny the Elder in his Natural History reported that a fasting woman's saliva is an effective cure for bloodshot eyes. Risks There are potential health hazards in wound licking due to infection risk, especially in immunocompromised patients. Human saliva contains a wide variety of bacteria that are harmless in the mouth, but that may cause significant infection if introduced into a wound. A notable case was a diabetic man who licked his bleeding thumb following a minor bicycle accident, and subsequently had to have the thumb amputated after it became infected with Eikenella corrodens from his saliva. Licking of people's wounds by animals=History and legend Dog saliva has been said by many cultures to have curative powers in people. \\"Langue de chien, langue de m√©decin\\" is a French saying meaning \\"A dog's tongue is a doctor's tongue\\", and a Latin quote that \\"Lingua canis dum lingit vulnus curat\\" or \\"A dog's saliva can heal your wound\\" appears in a thirteenth-century manuscript.The Aberdeen Bestiary, a thirteenth-century English illuminated manuscript In Ancient Greece, dogs at the shrine of Aesculapius were trained to lick patients, and snake saliva was also applied to wounds. Saint Roch in the Middle Ages was said to have been cured of a plague of sores by licking from his dog. The Assyrian Queen Semiramis is supposed to have attempted to resurrect the slain Armenian king Ara the Beautiful by having the dog god Aralez lick his wounds. In the Scottish Highlands in the nineteenth century, dog saliva was believed to be effective for treating wounds and sores. In the Gospel of Luke (16:19-31), Lazarus the Beggar's sores are licked by dogs, although no curative effects are reported by the Evangelist. Modern cases There are contemporary reports of the healing properties of dog saliva. Fijian fishermen are reported to allow dogs to lick their wounds to promote healing, and a case of dog saliva promoting wound healing was reported in the Lancet medical journal. Risks As with the licking of wounds by people, wound licking by animals carries a risk of infection. Allowing pet cats to lick open wounds can cause cellulitis and sepsis due to bacterial infections. Licking of open wounds by dogs could transmit rabies if the dog is infected with rabies, although this is said by the CDC to be rare. Dog saliva has been reported to complicate the healing of ulcers. Another issue is the possibility of an allergy to proteins in the saliva of pets, such as Fel d 1 in cat allergy and Can f 1 in dog allergy. Cases of serious infection following the licking of wounds by pets include: *Dog **A diabetic man who was infected by Pasteurella dagmatis due to the licking of his injured toe by his dog, causing a spinal infection. **A woman recovering from knee surgery suffered a persistent infection of the knee with Pasteurella after her dog licked a small wound on her toe. **A dog lick to an Australian woman's minor burn caused sepsis and necrosis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection, resulting in the loss of all her toes, fingers and a leg. **C. canimorsus caused acute kidney failure due to sepsis in a man whose open hand wound was licked by his dog. **A 68-year-old man died from sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis after a wound was licked by his dog. **A patient with a perforated eardrum developed meningitis after his dog passed on a Pasteurella multocida infection by licking his ear. *Cat **A woman recovering from surgery for endometrial cancer suffered from Pasteurella multocida infection causing an abscess after her cat licked the incision. **A blood donor whose cat licked her chapped fingers passed on Pasteurella infection to a 74-year-old transfusion recipient. **A seven-week-old boy contracted meningitis due to Pasteurella from contact with pet saliva.

Der Nersessian was a renowned academic and a pioneer in Armenian art history. She taught at several institutions in the United States, including Wellesley College in Massachusetts and as Henri Focillon Professor of Art and Archaeology at Harvard University. She was a senior fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, its deputy director from 1954‚Äì55 and 1961‚Äì62 and a member of its Board of Scholars. Der Nersessian was also a member of several international institutions such as the British Academy (1975), the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1978) and the Armenian Academy of Sciences (1966). Biography=Education Der Nersessian was born the youngest of three children in Constantinople in 1896. She came from a well-to-do family and her maternal uncle happened to be the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Malachia Ormanian. Her parents died while she was still young: her mother Akabi, when she was nine, and her father Mihran, when she was eighteen. She graduated from Yesayan Parochial School and the English High School in Constantinople, gaining fluency in Armenian, English and French at an early age. In 1915, during the height of the Armenian Genocide, Der Nersessian and her sister Arax (by then orphans) were forced to leave for Europe, where they took up residence in Geneva. Der Nersessian studied at the University of Geneva for several years until settling in Paris, France in 1919. Der Nersessian was admitted to Sorbonne University, studying history at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes de l'universit√© de Paris. She studied under the notable Byzantinologists Charles Diehl and Gabriel Millet and art historian Henri Focillon. In 1922, she became Millet's assistant, and with his help, published one of her first articles in 1929. The two theses (graduates students then had to submit two theses) that she presented for her doctorat d'etat, \\"L'illustration du roman de Barlaam et Joasaph\\" and a paper on Armenian illuminated manuscripts during the late medieval period, were well- received (earning a Mention tr√®s honorable), and both of them were awarded with prizes by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and Revue des √âtudes Grecques when they were published in 1937. Professor and pioneer In 1930, Der Nersessian moved to the United States at the suggestion of her three mentors, Byzantinists Charles Rufus Morey, Albert M. Friend Jr., and Walter Cook, becoming a part-time lecturer at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She taught art history at Wellesley, quickly gaining a full professorship and later becoming the chairwoman of the Department of Art History and Director of Farnsworth Museum. Der Nersessian was the first woman to teach Byzantine art at a woman‚Äôs college, the first woman to be decorated with the medal of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by Catholicos Vazgen I in 1960, the first woman invited to lecture at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, the only woman in her time to gain full professorship at Dumbarton Oaks, and the second woman to be honored with a gold medal from the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1970.Kouymjian. \\"Sirarpie Der Nersessian\\", pp. 482-493. In 1947, she received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. Der Nersessian remained at Dumbarton Oaks until 1978, when she retired to France and lived with her sister in Paris. Upon retirement, she had her entire library shipped to the Matenadaran in Yerevan, so as to better help Armenian scholars in their studies. Shortly after her death in 1989, an endowment fund for prospective art history students in Armenia, Fonds Sirarpie Der Neressian at the Institut de Recherches sur les Miniatures Arm√©no-Byzantines, was created in her honor. Bibliography Der Nersessian's work primarily concerned Armenian art history, including the study of church architecture, illuminated manuscripts, miniatures and sculpture.

History The house was built around 1897. The owner, Alexander Black, was a great-great-grandson of Samuel Black, who bought the land on which Blacksburg is now located. Alexander Black was a prominent businessman in the town, and his first house reflected the typical design of homes in Blacksburg at the time. When that house burned down, he chose to build a new house in the Queen Anne style. The house features elements such as steep cross-gabled roofs, gingerbread trim, towers, and vertical windows. The Black family lived in the house until 1935, when Alexander Black died. The house was then used as a funeral home until 2002. To accommodate its use as a funeral home, the wraparound porch was enclosed, and some interior walls were removed to provide gathering areas. The second-floor balcony and some of the bay windows were enclosed as well, and the house was given vinyl siding. Museum In 2002, the town proposed a retail development named Kent Square for the downtown area. The site of the Alexander Black House was planned to be occupied by a 400-stall parking garage. The town council allocated $2 million toward development of the parking garage, and they also purchased the house and made plans for its preservation. The town council then had the house moved to a new location on Draper Road and began the restoration process.

She was portrayed by Gabriele Kastner from August 24, 1996, to August 28, 1996. In 2008 the actress Ursula Heyer, who is known previously for serving as the German dubbing voice for Joan Collins, took over the role and debuted on-screen on August 26, 2008. She left the show on November 25, 2008, after her three months contract was up.  Character's background  Annegret is the alcoholic mother of Tanja von Anstetten. In 1996 she came to D√ºsseldorf. She disgraced herself and Tanja in front of the aristocratic Anstetten family and the press. Soon after, Annegret left town and was not seen for years. But in August 2008, Annegret comes back to D√ºsseldorf to look after her daughter, after she heard that she will marry the rich aristocratic Ansgar von Lahnstein. Charlie Schneider is the first to know, that Annegret is back in town and uses this information to shock her old enemy, Tanja. Annegret wants to make peace with her daughter and have a place in her life, after she mentions that her husband Walter died not long ago. But Tanja refuses to let her mother back in her life, after all what happened between them. Soon, Ansgar, who not marries Tanja out of love and wants her out of his life, and his former wife and current lover Nathalie get suspicious about Tanja's relationship with her mother and want to find out what really happened between back then. Ansgar finds a big lead, when he is asking after Tanja's younger brother Thomas, who died under mysterious circumstance with young eight years. Ansgar believes that Tanja might have something to do with the death of her brother and wants to use Annegret for that. But the old lady refuses to help him and tries to find her way back in Tanja's life. But Tanja can't forgive her mother and rejects her again and again. Annegret, an alcoholic, starts drinking again after a fight with her daughter. Ansgar finds her and finally sees his chance to find out what really happened. But Tanja can rescue herself and takes \\"care\\" of her mother. She employs the former jail-keeper Ulla M√ºller to hold her mother as a hostage and give her pills, so she couldn't remember anything and would go crazy with time. However, when Tanja is out of town, Ansgar and Nathalie try to find Annegret. After some misleads, they do and get locked-up by Ulla M√ºller too. But the police is already informed and can rescue them and Annegret's life. When Annegret is getting better and comes back to Castle K√∂nigsbrunn, Ansgar is sure that she is ready to tell the truth about Tanja, the kidnapping and about what happened to her brother Thomas. But when the police is already there, Annegret refuses to turn Tanja in and takes side with her daughter once again. But then finally, Annegret wants to open up to the entire Lahnstein family, but it's not what Ansgar hoped for. Annegret begins to tell what really happened in Tanja's childhood. She tells them about the beats from her own father and how her younger brother Thomas tried to protect Tanja. But he fell down the stairs after his father pushed him, when he tried again to look out for his older sister. Thomas died right after the fall. Tanja's father took the blame on her. Annegret didn't stud up for her daughter and both made Tanja responsible for Thomas death. After that Tanja was in a psychiatric institution for two years. When Annegret tells that in front of the entire Lahnstein family, she also begs for Tanja's forgiveness, when Tanja breaks down in tears. After the Lahnstein's know everything about Tanja's past, Ansgar tries to use his mother-in-law once again to get out of his marriage with Tanja. He tries to provoke her with Annegret, which leads to Tanja to pressure her mother to leave D√ºsseldorf for good. Annegret agrees, but only under one condition: Tanja needs to bring her to the airport. On the way, Annegret gives the situation a last try and tries to make peace with Tanja.

The group formed as a tendency of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) in 1940. It was described by other tendencies in the disintegrating organisation as pacifist. The group opposed Trotsky's Proletarian Military Policy, and was expelled in 1943. On the first day of conference held by the Fourth International in 1944, the Left Fraction and also the Trotskyist Opposition were reunited with the RSL. Despite the objections of the Left Fraction, the second day saw the reformed RSL unified with the rival Workers International League ‚Äì on the WIL's terms ‚Äì to form the new Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).Sam Bornstein and Al Richardson, Against the Stream (Socialist Platform, 1986) The Left Fraction initially remained within the RCP, but refused to accept the authority of its leadership. They published their own newspaper, the Militant Miner, aimed at coalminers, and determined instead to pursue a policy of entryism within the Labour Party. As a result, they were expelled in 1945. Outside the RCP, the Left Fraction began publishing a general entryist newspaper, the Voice of Labour. The Labour Party opposed this, and expelled two Fraction members, Tom Mercer and Harry Selby, for contributing to it. This led to a split within the organisation over tactics, with the group's leadership deciding to join the newly formed Socialist Fellowship. They dissolved the organisation in 1948. A majority of the organisation opposed the group's dissolution, but only a small rump based in Glasgow actually continued under the Left Fraction name. Some members left to join a new Revolutionary Socialist League in 1956.John Moorhouse, A Historical Glossary of British Marxism (Pauper's Press, 1987) After a failed attempt to work with the International Group, the remainder determined to continue alone, publishing the journal Politics. In 1966, the Left Fraction - by now possibly consisting solely of Selby - discussed a joint publication with the tiny Socialist Current organisation, but this was not pursued.Harry Selby , Revolutionary History Vol 1, No 2 The Left Fraction finally ceased operations in 1967.

He spent his early years living with his family at the Wairau Bar near Blenheim where, in 1939 as a schoolboy, he discovered early human skeletons and associated artefacts including necklaces, stone tools and moa egg. Eyles discovered several more burials on the bar, and assisted with the excavations carried out by Roger Duff from the Canterbury Museum. The site is regarded as one of the oldest and most important archaeological sites in New Zealand. Eyles continued his association with Duff during the excavations of Pyramid Valley Swamp in the 1940s. Duff recognised his contribution by naming an extinct hawk found in the swamp the Eyles' harrier. In the 1991 Queen's Birthday Honours, Eyles was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to archaeology.

Crisis The secondary banks, like the larger institutions, had been lending heavily based on the previously rising housing prices of the late 1960s and early 1970s, borrowing excessively in relation to the collateral assets. A sudden downturn in house prices and increases in interest rates well before the November 1973 oil crisis left the smaller institutions holding many loans secured by property with lower value than the loans. The Bank of England, led by Jasper Hollom,\\"Sir Jasper Hollom\\", The Times, 17 September 2014, p. 54. conducted negotiations resulting in bail-outs of around 30 of the smaller banks and intervened to assist some 30 others. While all of the banks were left able to pay depositors, the Bank of England lost an estimated ¬£100 million. The downturn was exacerbated by the global 1973‚Äì74 stock market crash, which hit the UK while it was already in the midst of the housing price crash. Recovery On 19 December 1974, a rent freeze by the Edward Heath government which had lasted since 1971 was ended, and the Bank of England, which had severely restricted the supply of credit for housing in 1971, released more funds.Glyn Davies. A History of Money from Ancient Times to the Present Day, rev. ed. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1996. pp. 406‚Äì407, 414, 419‚Äì425 While housing prices and lending recovered in 1975, inflation continued to rise, leading to greater economic, labour and political problems for Britain. The Bank of England's regulatory powers over lenders were increased in the Banking Act 1979 to try to prevent a repeat of the crisis. Causes The causes remain a source of debate. Some blame the lax regulation of lenders and policy-driven inflationary pressures (the 'Barber Boom', named after Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber), which failed in its target of lowering the high unemployment rate. A sudden tightening of credit (interest rates were raised to 13% in October 1973) was laid at the feet of the Bank of England.Led Zeppelin, soaring oil and house prices: is it 1973 all over again?

International Monetary Fund, (1991) \\"The English secondary banking crisis of 1973‚Äì75 was mainly the result of overborrowing on the part of real estate and securities firms and by the collapse of property and share prices following tight monetary policy in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.\\" p. 204 Others blame the Heath government's fixing of rent price rises in 1971. The only book-length study of the crisis by Reid (1982) blames all those factors but also a bubble of housing prices that saw a 50% increase in London real estate prices over 1971 and the financial uncertainty caused by the end of the Bretton Woods agreement and the inconclusive elections of February 1974. The period was also marked by a series of crises, including the political uncertainty of the Heath government, waves of public sector and industrial strikes and oil shortages that led to a government-mandated three-day work week. However, Reid also blames the entire market culture of the London banking institutions from the late 1960s, which she considers made market speculation (and consequent crashes) inevitable.Margret Reid.

It was also the largest adobe building in California and the largest original building at any of the California missions. The building View of the Convento from the street The Convento is a large two-story building, measuring approximately long and wide. It has four-foot-thick adobe walls and was built in stages between approximately 1808 and 1822. (\\"Construction of the building was begun in 1808 and completed in 1822, making it one of the oldest remaining structures in the state.\\") The long portico, sometimes referred to as the colonnade, in front of the building has 20 arches and is the most recognized image of the Mission San Fernando. It was and is the largest adobe structure in California and is also the largest original building in California's missions. (\\"Known as the 'long building,' it is the largest original structure in the Mission Chain, and the largest adobe building in California.\\") (\\"The Long Building is the largest adobe building in California and the largest original structure from mission days.\\") The Convento also has a library with 1,760 volumes, dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries. History Photograph of the Convento taken by William Amos Haines, circa 1910 Painting of Francisco Garc√≠a Diego y Moreno at the Convento Building Painting of Thaddeus Amat y Brusi (first Bishop of Los Angeles) at the Convento Building During the days of the Mission, the Convento was used as a residential building for the missionaries, including temporary accommodations for the missionaries as they traveled between the missions along the Camino Real. California's first bishop, Francisco Garc√≠a Diego y Moreno, lived at the Convento from 1820 to 1835. In 1846, the Mexican government confiscated the missions and secularized the properties. Pio Pico became the owner of the Mission San Fernando, selling it in 1846 to Elogio de Chelis. When John C. Fremont led an American military force into California in 1847, he occupied the Convento and used it as a base of operations. Between 1857 and 1861, the Convento was used as a station for the Butterfield Stage Line between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Los Angeles Times visited the Mission in 1883 and found it \\"rapidly going to decay.\\" The one building that was reported to be in fair shape was the Convento, which the Times described as follows: > \\"The priest's quarters is a large structure, about three hundred feet long > by fifty wide, with a broad portico or porch, supported by brick pillars, > and extending the whole length of the building. The rafters are rough poles, > thatched over with wild cane, and over this is a roof of burnt tile. ... > This large building is in a fair state of preservation, and is tenanted by > several Spanish families. Some carpenters (Spanish) are fitting up one end > of the place for a Catholic church ...\\" For most of the last half of the 19th Century, the Convento was left to decay. In 1896, the Landmarks Club (led by Charles Fletcher Lummis) signed a ten-year lease on the Mission, planning to restore it. A celebration attended by 500 people was held on the Mission's centennial in 1897. The Times reported at that time that the \\"old convent\\" building, \\"being strongly built,\\" had \\"withstood more successfully the ravages of time.\\" The Times report continued: > \\"The convent itself is in fairly good repair. The building is long by 60 > deep, and is entered by doors from the corridor that runs its whole length. > The tiled roof is nearly intact, and the window gratings and heavy doors are > still strong enough to defy hostile entry. The floor of the corridor is > simply the packed earth that has been trodden by thousands of feet, and its > outer wall is pierced by a succession of low arches, in the familiar style > of mission architecture.\\" Photograph by Keystone-Mast, circa 1900 In 1963, the church undertook a restoration of the Convento, including removal of the roof, waterproofing of the structure, and replacement of the beams and original tile. During the 1963 restoration, workers found the old beams \\"firmly tied with strips of tough rawhide, revealing the craftsmanship of the Shoshone Indians who worked on the landmark in the early 1800s.\\" Portico of the Convento Building In February 1971, the Mission sustained major damage from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The Mission's chapel was completely destroyed, and a massive fireplace in the center of the Convento shook loose and cracked several interior walls. Though the chapel was beyond repair, the Convento was restored in 1973, making it the only original building remaining from the original mission. As part of the repair process, the Convento was also reinforced, replastered, and painted inside and out. As the only original building remaining at the Mission San Fernando, the Convento was singled out in 1988 for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

Whenever the large rotating magnetic field set up by the Egg of Columbus was turned on it impressed the public by spinning various magnetized metal balls and painted metal disks on the display table and even small disks inside vacuum bulbs placed at some distance around the Electricity Building.Marc Seifer (1996) Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla, page 121Thomas Commerford Martin, The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla: With Special Reference to His Work in Polyphase Currents and High Potential Lighting, Electrical Engineer - 1894, Chapter XLII, page 485 Underneath what the public saw was a toroidal iron core stator on which four electromagnetic coils were wound. The device was powered by a two-phase alternating current source (such as a variable speed alternator) to create the rotating magnetic field. The device operated on a frequency of 25 to 300 hertz. The ideal operating frequency was described as being between 35 and 40 hertz. The device has been described as being built by Westinghouse engineer Charles F.

Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures. The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games. Definitions=Ludwig Wittgenstein Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game. In his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games are. From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances. As the following game definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong and that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem. Roger Caillois French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men), defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics: * fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character * separate: it is circumscribed in time and place * uncertain: the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable * non- productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful * governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life * fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality Chris Crawford Game designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of computers. using a series of dichotomies: # Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and entertainment if made for money. # A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment. # If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge. # If a challenge has no \\"active agent against whom you compete\\", it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.) # Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game. Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other. Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment and games are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain. Other definitions * \\"A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.\\" (Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman) * \\"A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal.\\" (Greg Costikyan) According to this definition, some \\"games\\" that do not involve choices, such as Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, and War are not technically games any more than a slot machine is. * \\"A game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context.\\" (Clark C. Abt) * \\"At its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces, confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome.\\" (Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith) * \\"A game is a form of play with goals and structure.\\" (Kevin J. Maroney) * \\"to play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by specific rules, where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules, and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity.\\" (Bernard Suits) * \\"When you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities, all games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation.\\" (Jane McGonigal) Gameplay elements and classification Games can be characterized by \\"what the player does\\". This is often referred to as gameplay. Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game. Tools A selection of pieces from different games. From top: Chess pawns, marbles, Monopoly tokens, dominoes, Monopoly hotels, jacks and checkers pieces. Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.g. miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer). In places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, soccer (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball. Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards. Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces. Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a point scored. Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment. Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars. Rules and aims Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules. While rules are subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually results in a \\"new\\" game. For instance, baseball can be played with \\"real\\" baseballs or with wiffleballs. However, if the players decide to play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different game. There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules. Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights and responsibilities of the players, and each player's goals. Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens. The rules of a game are to be distinguished from its aims. For most competitive games, the ultimate ‚Äòaim‚Äô is winning: in this sense, checkmate is the aim of chess. Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate). However, when we talk about the aims of a game, we also refer to intermediate aims: the things that you have to do in order to win the game. For instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase your likelihood to win the game (but isn't alone sufficient to win the game). Aims are not just a 'special' kind of rules: the difference between the rules of a game and the aims of a game is a fundamental one. This can be seen by considering some examples. The aim of chess is to checkmate, but although it is expected that players will try to checkmate each other, it is not a rule of chess that a player must checkmate the other player whenever he can (as a matter of fact, unskilled players often fail to take the opportunity to do so). Similarly, it is not a rule of football that a player must score a goal if he shoots a penalty (it is only expected, and not required, that he will try). On a general level, the distinction between the rules and the aims of a game can be characterised as follows: an aim identifies a sufficient condition for successful action, whereas the rule identifies a necessary condition for permissible action. While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a game merely requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow them; it rarely (if ever) requires luck or demanding skills. Skill, strategy, and chance A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly. Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and stake, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess. Games of strategy include checkers, chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them. Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, Mahjong, roulette, etc.), as well as snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice. However, most games contain two or all three of these elements. For example, American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance. Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne. Single-player games Most games require multiple players. However, single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a one-player game is a battle solely against an element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own skills, against time, or against chance. Playing with a yo-yo or playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a game due to the lack of any formidable opposition. Many games described as \\"single-player\\" may be termed actually puzzles or recreations. Multiplayer games The Card Players by Lucas van Leyden (1520) depicting a multiplayer card game. A multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent opponents or teams. Games with many independent players are difficult to analyze formally using game theory as the players may form and switch coalitions. The term \\"game\\" in this context may mean either a true game played for entertainment, or a competitive activity describable in principle by mathematical game theory. =Game theory= John Nash proved that games with several players have a stable solution provided that coalitions between players are disallowed. Nash won the Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von Neumann's theory of zero-sum games. Nash's stable solution is known as the Nash equilibrium. If cooperation between players is allowed, then the game becomes more complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such games. While these have had some partial success in the fields of economics, politics and conflict, no good general theory has yet been developed. In quantum game theory, it has been found that the introduction of quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of equilibrium strategy not found in traditional games. The entanglement of players's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing players from profiting from what is known as betrayal. Types Tug of war is an easily organized, impromptu game that requires little equipment Games can take a variety of forms, from competitive sports to board games and video games. Sports Association football is a popular sport worldwide.alt= Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields, leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of players. A city or town may set aside such resources for the organization of sports leagues. Popular sports may have spectators who are entertained just by watching games. A community will often align itself with a local sports team that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its players only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their opponents or have traditional rivalries. The concept of fandom began with sports fans. Certain competitive sports, such as racing and gymnastics, are not games by definitions such as Crawford's (see above) ‚Äì despite the inclusion of many in the Olympic Games ‚Äì because competitors do not interact with their opponents; they simply challenge each other in indirect ways. =Lawn games= Lawn games are outdoor games that can be played on a lawn; an area of mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a sports field (pitch). Variations of many games that are traditionally played on a sports field are marketed as \\"lawn games\\" for home use in a front or back yard. Common lawn games include horseshoes, sholf, croquet, bocce, lawn bowls, and stake. Tabletop games A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply placing, picking up and moving game pieces. Most of these games are played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the game's elements are located. However, many games falling into this category, particularly party games, are more free-form in their play and can involve physical activity such as mime. Still, these games do not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of strength or stamina, or specialized equipment other than what comes in a box. =Dexterity and coordination games= This class of games includes any game in which the skill element involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but excludes the class of video games (see below). Games such as jacks, paper football, and Jenga require only very portable or improvised equipment and can be played on any flat level surface, while other examples, such as pinball, billiards, air hockey, foosball, and table hockey require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on which the game is played. The advent of home video game systems largely replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey, billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and public game rooms. These games and others, as they require reflexes and coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such the games are popular as drinking games. In addition, dedicated drinking games such as quarters and beer pong also involve physical coordination and are popular for similar reasons. =Board games= Parcheesi is an American adaptation of a Pachisi, originating in India. Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status, resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens. Many also involve dice or cards. Most games that simulate war are board games (though a large number of video games have been created to simulate strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players' tokens move. Virtually all board games involve \\"turn-based\\" play; one player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does the same, and a player can only act on their turn. This is opposed to \\"real-time\\" play as is found in some card games, most sports and most video games. Some games, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element for their interest. Such games are usually described as having \\"perfect information\\"; the only unknown is the exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any unknown event inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll). Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no decisions to be made. By some definitions, such as that by Greg Costikyan, they are not games since there are no decisions to make which affect the outcome. Many other games involving a high degree of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player within the game, which is independent of any other player; the \\"game\\" then is actually a \\"race\\" by definitions such as Crawford's. Most other board games combine strategy and luck factors; the game of backgammon requires players to decide the best strategic move based on the roll of two dice. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets. German-style board games are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board games. Board game groups include race games, roll-and-move games, abstract strategy games, word games, and wargames, as well as trivia and other elements. Some board games fall into multiple groups or incorporate elements of other genres: Cranium is one popular example, where players must succeed in each of four skills: artistry, live performance, trivia, and language. =Card games= Playing Cards, by Theodoor Rombouts, 17th century Card games use a deck of cards as their central tool. These cards may be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc.), a regional deck using 32, 36 or 40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of trick-taking games collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as Set or 1000 Blank White Cards). Uno and Rook are examples of games that were originally played with a standard deck and have since been commercialized with customized decks. Some collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering are played with a small selection of cards that have been collected or purchased individually from large available sets. Some board games include a deck of cards as a gameplay element, normally for randomization or to keep track of game progress. Conversely, some card games such as Cribbage use a board with movers, normally to keep score. The differentiation between the two genres in such cases depends on which element of the game is foremost in its play; a board game using cards for random actions can usually use some other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be scored on paper. These elements as used are simply the traditional and easiest methods to achieve their purpose. =Dice games= Students using dice to improve numeracy skills. They roll three dice, then use basic math operations to combine those into a new number which they cover on the board. The goal is to cover four squares in the row. Dice games use a number of dice as their central element. Board games often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the central indicator of the person's standing in the game. Popular dice games include Yahtzee, Farkle, Bunco, Liar's dice/Perudo, and Poker dice. As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently random numbers, these games usually involve a high degree of luck, which can be directed to some extent by the player through more strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory. Such games are thus popular as gambling games; the game of Craps is perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were originally conceived of as gambling games. =Domino and tile games= Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or \\"pips\\", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears on a tile is unique in the set. The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's \\"hand\\" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board. Sets vary in the number of possible dots on one end, and thus of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common set historically is double-six, though in more recent times \\"extended\\" sets such as double-nine have been introduced to increase the number of dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a game. Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Texas 42 is a domino game more similar in its play to a \\"trick-taking\\" card game. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles. Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck \\"pack\\" of Anglo-American playing cards. Mahjong is another game very similar to Rummy that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art. Lastly, some games use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which other elements of the game are played. Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne are examples. In each, the \\"board\\" is made up of a series of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but static, while in Carcassonne the game is played by \\"building\\" the board tile- by-tile. Hive, an abstract strategy game using tiles as moving pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to chess, although it has no board; the pieces themselves both form the layout and can move within it. =Pencil and paper games= Pencil and paper games require little or no specialized equipment other than writing materials, though some such games have been commercialized as board games (Scrabble, for instance, is based on the idea of a crossword puzzle, and tic-tac-toe sets with a boxed grid and pieces are available commercially). These games vary widely, from games centering on a design being drawn such as Pictionary and \\"connect-the-dots\\" games like sprouts, to letter and word games such as Boggle and Scattergories, to solitaire and logic puzzle games such as Sudoku and crossword puzzles. =Guessing games= A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word. Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, Taboo, Pictionary, and similar. The genre also includes many game shows such as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid. Video games Video games are computer- or microprocessor-controlled games. Computers can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types. Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design, each with its own set of rules or goals. A computer or video game uses one or more input devices, typically a button/joystick combination (on arcade games); a keyboard, mouse or trackball (computer games); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool (console games). More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have also been used for input. There are many genres of video game; the first commercial video game, Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis. As processing power increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles. This \\"real-time\\" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to \\"turn-based\\" strategy; this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically. Additionally, the playing of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or simulations of sports. Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table games such as chess, leading to simulations of such games that can be played by a single player. In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style games, the game provides a virtual environment in which the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe. Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred some debate on whether these should be considered \\"games\\" or \\"toys\\". (Crawford specifically mentions Will Wright's SimCity as an example of a toy.) =Online games= Online games have been part of culture from the very earliest days of networked and time-shared computers. Early commercial systems such as Plato were at least as widely famous for their games as for their strictly educational value. In 1958, Tennis for Two dominated Visitor's Day and drew attention to the oscilloscope at the Brookhaven National Laboratory; during the 1980s, Xerox PARC was known mainly for Maze War, which was offered as a hands-on demo to visitors. Modern online games are played using an Internet connection; some have dedicated client programs, while others require only a web browser. Some simpler browser games appeal to more casual gaming demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very few video games. Role-playing games Role-playing games, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of game in which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting in a fictional setting. The original role playing games ‚Äì or at least those explicitly marketed as such ‚Äì are played with a handful of participants, usually face-to-face, and keep track of the developing fiction with pen and paper. Together, the players may collaborate on a story involving those characters; create, develop, and \\"explore\\" the setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of everyday life. Pen-and-paper role-playing games include, for example, Dungeons & Dragons and GURPS. The term role-playing game has also been appropriated by the video game industry to describe a genre of video games. These may be single-player games where one player experiences a programmed environment and story, or they may allow players to interact through the internet. The experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing games. Single-player games include Final Fantasy, Fable, The Elder Scrolls, and Mass Effect. Online multi-player games, often referred to as Massively Multiplayer Online role playing games, or MMORPGs, include RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Guild Wars, MapleStory, Anarchy Online, and Dofus. , the most successful MMORPG has been World of Warcraft, which controls the vast majority of the market. Business games Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board games to interactive games involving different props (balls, ropes, hoops, etc.) and different kinds of activities. The purpose of these games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to generate discussions about business improvement. Many business games focus on organizational behaviors. Some of these are computer simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing. Team building is a common focus of such activities. Simulation The term \\"game\\" can include simulation or re-enactment of various activities or use in \\"real life\\" for various purposes: e.g., training, analysis, prediction. Well-known examples are war games and role-playing. The root of this meaning may originate in the human prehistory of games deduced by anthropology from observing primitive cultures, in which children's games mimic the activities of adults to a significant degree: hunting, warring, nursing, etc. These kinds of games are preserved in modern times.

The main sources for Orca's life are letters written to him by Cicero and passages in Caesar's Bellum Civile. Life and career Orca is generally regarded as the son of Quintus Valerius Soranus,Giovanni Niccolini, I fasti dei tribuni della plebe (Milan 1934), pp. 430‚Äì431. For the father's political career, scholarly reputation, and controversial death, see article on Quintus Valerius Soranus. a partisan of Gaius Marius who was executed during the Sullan proscriptions of 82 BC, allegedly for violating a religious prohibition against revealing the secret name of Rome.Conrad Cichorius, ‚ÄúZur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus,‚Äù Hermes 41 (1906) 59‚Äì68, remains the most thorough treatment of the evidence for Soranus's life and career; English abstract in American Journal of Philology 28 (1907) 468. The family came from the municipality of Sora, near Cicero's native Arpinum. Cicero refers to the Valerii Sorani as his friends and neighbors.Marcus Tullius Cicero, Brutus 169: vicini et familiares mei; Edwin S. Ramage, ‚ÄúCicero on Extra-Roman Speech,‚Äù Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 92 (1961), pp. 487‚Äì488; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34. Next to nothing is known of Orca's early career. As praetor in 57 BC, he actively supported Cicero's return from exile,Marcus Tullius Cicero, Post reditum in senatu 23; L√©onie Hayne, \\"Who Went to Luca?\\" Classical Philology 69 (1974), p. 218. and in 56, while governor in Africa, he was the recipient of two letters of recommendation from Cicero.On behalf of Caius Curtius and Publius Cuspius: Cicero, Epistulae ad familiares 13.6 (= 57 in the chronological edition of Shackleton Bailey) and 13.6a (= 58 SB); C. Nicolet, \\"Le cens senatorial sous la Republique et sous Auguste,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 66 (1976), p. 27. Orca and Cicero had close enough relations that they had agreed upon the use of a sign or symbol to mark their correspondence as authentic and trustworthy.Hannah M. Cotton, \\"Mirificum genus commendationis: Cicero and the Latin Letter of Recommendation,\\" American Journal of Philology 106 (1985), p. 332; John Nicholson, \\"The Delivery and Confidentiality of Cicero's Letters,\\" Classical Journal 90 (1994), pp. 47‚Äì48. Orca then disappears from the historical record for several years. The length of his term in Africa is undetermined; the next known governor, P. Attius Varus, was there in 52 and probably earlier.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 886, note 368. It has been conjectured, though the dating of his governorship might argue to the contrary, that he was among those attending the conference held April 56 BC in Luca by Julius Caesar, Pompeius Magnus, and Marcus Crassus; in the company of a number of supporters the three worked out the strategic political alliance that led to the extension of Caesar's command in Gaul and the joint election of Pompey and Crassus to their second consulship.L√©onie Hayne, \\"Who Went to Luca?\\" Classical Philology 69 (1974), p. 220. On the dating of Orca's governorship in Africa, see T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2 (New York 1952), pp. 201 and 212. Role in civil war During the Roman civil wars of the 40s, Valerius Orca resurfaces as one of Caesar's legates. Early in 49 BC, Orca was sent to occupy Sardinia. Caesar claims that the inhabitants of Caralis (modern Cagliari), the capital, were so roused by word of Orca's approach that on their own initiative (sua sponte) they threw out the Pompey-allied governor, who fled to Africa.Julius Caesar, Bellum civile 1.30.2‚Äì3 and 31.1; Scholia in Lucani Bellum civile, note to Lucan's Bellum civile 3.64, p. 93 in the edition of Hermann Usener (Leipzig: Teubner 1869); T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2 (New York 1952), pp. 260 and 270. The Greek historian Appian implies that part of Sardinia's strategic significance in the conflict was its importance as a center of grain production;Appian, Bellum civile 2.40. Cassius Dio says little about the occupation of Sardinia by the Caesarians, noting merely that it was uncontested.Cassius Dio, Roman History 41.18.1. Land distribution in Volaterrae The countryside of Volterra (ancient Volaterrae) After Caesar came into the dictatorship, Orca was given a commission to confiscate land in the area around Volaterrae in Etruria, which was to be redistributed to Caesar's veterans as a reward for their service.Cicero, Epistulae ad familiares 13.5 (= 319 Shackleton Bailey); T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2 (New York 1952), p. 312. The history of these land distributions is vexed, and the degree of Orca's success is unclear. In the earlier civil war between Marius and Sulla, Volaterrae had sided with Marius, who supported greater extension of rights to Rome's allies than did the conservative Sulla. The Sullans lay siege to the town in 80 BC, and as a result of their defeat, the Volaterreans had suffered a reduction of rights and territory. This event had ended the Etruscan era for the city-state, but by 63 BC the previously confiscated lands still had not been distributed. Cicero successfully opposed this redistribution, and blocked another in 60. The issue seems to have remained unresolved for another fifteen years, until Caesar's decision to establish a colony there in 45. Although an inscription provides evidence that Volaterrae had the legal status of colonia in the early Principate, there are few archaeological traces to indicate that veterans actually received and inhabited the land. It has been conjectured that the Volaterreans were able to negotiate a less radical reorganization from Orca, perhaps through the network of friendships, family ties and connectionsOf the sort expressed by the Latin terms amici, hospites, and clientes. left from his pro-Marian father and his friend Cicero.Nicola Terrenato explores the historical situation of Volaterrae in \\"Tam firmum municipium: The Romanization of Volaterrae and Its Cultural Implications,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 88 (1998) 94‚Äì114; see pp. 106‚Äì107 on Orca's commission.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 809 in 2019. It is located within the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History Montalba was given this name when William J. Hamlett, Jr., applied to have a post office established in the community and for the building to be located east of the Trinity River and south of Beaver Creek as early as December 1881. The nearest post office at that time was in nearby Tennessee Colony, located west of Montalba. Hamlett named the settlement Montalba, and it is thought to be named this because of the white sand on a mountain located east of the community. The post office was originally located at Beaver Valley, a community located about two or three miles north of the settlement, in 1848. P.G. Oldham was one of the first settlers in the community, in which he built a home just northwest of the settlement in 1853. A church called Beaver Valley Primitive Baptist Church was located near the community. A cemetery was established in the settlement, and became known as Holly Springs. The location of Beaver Valley and Montalba on a road between Palestine and Athens made both of those communities central gathering places for farmers in the area. Beaver Valley did this first, then Montalba. The community's early industry is unknown, but there is a foundry that was used during the Civil War to make firearms and ammunition within the community's loose boundaries. It is mostly agrarian, and the community is both a supply point and a local market. There were two gas stations, a combined gas station and general store, a 4-H Club building, a community center, a post office, numerous homes, and three churches in Montalba in 1978. It has had several populations. Its population nadir was 50 in both 1925 and 1933, and its population zenith was 300 in 1931. It reached 200 residents in 1964, and then plunged to 110 between 1974 and 1989. It had a population of 110 from that year through 2000.

Adams and Mrs. B.H. Brooks worked together to join the schools in Black Rock and Pace's Chapel together since the surrounding school districts joined them as well. This district had 188 White and 183 African American children enrolled in 1933. Today the community is served by the Palestine Independent School District.

In culinary circles, he is best known for his association with Saveur magazine, which he founded with Dorothy Kalins, Michael Grossman, and Christopher Hirsheimer in 1994 and where he served as editor-in-chief from 2001 until 2006. Food Notes New York Times After resigning from the magazine in 2006, he became the restaurant columnist for Gourmet.Colman Andrews Colman Andrews on gourmet.com In 2010, he helped launch a food and drink website, The Daily Meal, and served as its editorial director until mid-2018. He is now a senior editor specializing in food and travel for 24/7 Wall St. He is considered one of the world's foremost experts on Spanish cuisine, particularly that of the Catalonia region.Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery Early life Born in Santa Monica, California. His father, Charles Robert Hardy Douglas Andrews, born in Effingham, Kansas, was a newspaperman, pioneering radio soap opera writer, novelist, and screenwriter. Andrews' mother was Irene Colman (n√©e Bressette), an actress of French- Canadian descent born in Nashua, New Hampshire. She played a chorus girl in several Gold Diggers movies and had ingenue roles in a number of other movies. Andrews and his sister, Ann Merry Victoria Andrews (two years his junior) and his older half-sister Joy grew up in the West Los Angeles neighborhood of Holmby Hills. The family moved to Ojai, north of Los Angeles, in 1959, and Andrews attended Villanova Preparatory School in the same town. Early career After high school, Andrews went on to Loyola University ‚Äì now Loyola Marymount University ‚Äì in Los Angeles as an English major. Kicked out of Loyola after one year for ignoring his studies in favor of the campus radio station, Andrews spent the next year-and-a-half working and traveling, living for brief periods in Atlanta and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Returning to Los Angeles, he enrolled at Los Angeles City College in 1965. He took a job in the bookshop at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art the same year. In 1968, after a year-and-a-half at Los Angeles City College and a year at California State University at Los Angeles, Andrews was accepted at the University of California at Los Angeles. He graduated in 1969 with degrees in history and philosophy. Andrews' first restaurant reviewing job was for The Staff, an offshoot of the LA Free Press. In early 1972, Andrews, a music lover and amateur singer and songwriter, was hired by the publicity department of Atlantic Records and penned press releases for such albums as Bette Midler's and Jackson Browne's debuts. Still writing restaurant reviews on the side, he began to seriously study wine and was a fan in particular of the wine writer Roy Brady, who espoused the notion that a wine should be judged not by its reputation or price but instead by what it smells and tastes like. Brady became his mentor in wine matters.www.Saveur.com Magazine life Andrews left Atlantic to become the editor of Coast, a Los Angeles-based lifestyle magazine; he held the position until 1975. Meanwhile, Andrews continued reviewing records for Creem, where Lester Bangs was his editor, and covering live music in the LA area for The Hollywood Reporter . He also wrote liner notes for numerous albums, receiving a Grammy nomination in 1972 for notes on a special edition of Miles Davis reissues. In 1975, Lois Dwan, restaurant reviewer for The Los Angeles Times, asked Andrews to substitute for her while she went on vacation. This began his long association with the newspaper; though not officially on staff, he was alternately a restaurant reviewer and columnist, book reviewer and travel writer, and the editor of the paper's travel magazine, Traveling in Style. He contributed pieces to Ampersand's Entertainment Guide from 1977 to the mid-1980s. In 1978, Andrews, was hired as an associate editor at New West magazine, a bi-weekly California publication started by Clay Felker as a parallel to his seminal New York magazine. He was promoted a year later to senior editor. During this time he met Ruth Reichl, then the restaurant columnist for the Northern California edition of New West, who would go on to become the restaurant critic of the New York Times from 1993 to 1999, and, later, the editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine. For a period the two were lovers, their relationship chronicled in Reichl's memoir Comfort Me with Apples (Random House, 2002). Andrews left New West in 1980 and began writing for Apartment Life, an urbane lifestyle magazine helmed by Dorothy Kalins. A year later that magazine was transformed into Metropolitan Home. Over the course of that magazine's first decade . Andrews wrote about restaurants all over the world; he was the first American reporter to introduce readers to the great French chef Guy Savoy. Perhaps most significantly, Andrews got a contract to write a book on Catalan cuisine based on an article he'd written for Met Home. Throughout the eighties he spent a great deal of time traveling to Barcelona and vicinity. The resulting book, Catalan Cuisine, published in 1988 and still in print, has become the standard reference book for restaurant kitchens in that region, and is revered by the top local chefs, including the world-renowned Ferran Adria. Saveur and Later  After finishing his Catalan book, Andrews worked as a freelancer, writing articles for the Los Angeles Times and for Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, Travel & Leisure, and many other publications. In 1992, Andrews published his second book, Everything on the Table: Plain Talk About Food and Wine, a collection of new and revised short pieces, and shortly thereafter he began work on a book about the cuisines of Genoa and Nice, Flavors of the Riviera: Discovering Real Mediterranean Cuisine, published in 1996. Meanwhile, in 1994, Andrews had become a co-founder of Saveur magazine, and in late 1995, he moved from Los Angeles to New York City. The magazine was the first of its kind to delve beyond recipes and formulas and tell the stories of the people and cultures behind the food. During his tenure, Andrews won six James Beard Journalism Awards, and in 2000, Saveur became the first food magazine to win the American Society of Magazine Editors' award for General Excellence. The following year, after the magazine changed ownership, Kalins left to work for Newsweek and Andrews took over as editor-in-chief. He left Saveur in 2006, becoming the restaurant columnist for Gourmet and undertaking new book projects‚Äîthe first of which, The Country Cooking of Ireland, was published in 2009 by Chronicle Books. This was followed by Ferran Adri√†: The Man Who Reinvented Food (2010), The Country Cooking of Italy (2011), The Taste of America (2013), My Usual Table: A Life in Restaurants (2014), and The British Table: A New Look at the Traditional Cooking of England, Scotland, and Wales.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 170 in both 1990 and 2000. Geography Sacul is located at (31.8248953, -94.9188271) in northwestern Nacogdoches County. It is situated at the junction of State Highway 204 and FM 1648, approximately 21 miles northwest of Nacogdoches and 25 miles southeast of Jacksonville. History The area was initially part of a dispersed settlement called Tolivar. The community of Tolivar had a post office that was located midway between the present-day towns of Cushing and Sacul. It was located in the home of B.W. Pye, who served as postmaster. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which provided passenger services and freight hauling between Dallas and Beaumont, constructed a rail stop a few miles from Tolivar shortly after 1900. It was at that location that a town site was laid out on land owned by the Lucas family and W.T. Williamson. The founders originally wanted to call the new community Lucas after one of the area's principal land owners, but postal officials denied the application because there was already another town in the state with that name ‚Äì Lucas in Collin County. The application was resubmitted with the name Sacul, a backwards spelling of Lucas, and was approved. Similarly, the nearby town of Reklaw was also named with a spelling reversal. Sacul's post office was established in 1903. That same year, a Town Center ‚Äì also called the \\"Blue Building\\" or \\"Boardwalk\\" by locals ‚Äì was built. It housed a bank, mercantile store, and a pharmacy. In 1904, a school opened in the community. Sacul experienced rapid growth in the coming years. By 1914, around 400 people lived in the community with a number of business establishments including six general stores, three grocers, two cotton gins, a blacksmith, hardware store, and a bank. There were also two churches in Sacul, one Baptist and the other Methodist. The community continued to prosper throughout the 1920s, but the Great Depression precipitated a decline and many businesses were closed. By the mid-1930s, the population had fallen to 250 and the number of businesses dwindled to ten. Increased mobility after World War II accelerated the community's steep decline. By the mid-1960s, Sacul had 170 residents and four businesses. During the remainder of the twentieth century, the population continued to hover around 170. Events Sacul hosted the first of its annual Folk Festivals in June 1986. On the fourth Saturday of each month, a Bluegrass music festival known as the \\"Sacul Opry\\" attracts hundreds of fans to the community. Education Public education in the community of Sacul is provided by the Cushing Independent School District. All of the district's campuses are located in the city of Cushing.

Because of high mountains on all sides, the Annapurna Sanctuary receives only 7 hours of sunlight a day at the height of summer. The unique combination of heights and depths on the 5-7 day trek into the Annapurna Sanctuary give rise to an extraordinary variety of ecosystems. The south-facing slopes are covered in dense tropical jungles of rhododendron and bamboo, while the north-facing slopes, in the rain shadow, have a drier colder climate similar to that of the near-by Tibetan Plateau.

As they have most of the typical characteristics of the North-Western Bulgarian dialects, they are sometimes classified as belonging to this subgroup under the name of Extreme North-Western dialects. On Bulgarian territory, the Transitional dialects occupy a narrow strip of land along the Bulgarian border with Serbia, including the regions of Tran, Breznik, Godech and Belogradchik. They also cross the border to include the dialects or subdialects of the Bulgarian minority in the Western Outlands (the regions of Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad). The Transitional dialects are part of the Torlak dialectal group also spoken in southeastern Serbia and North Macedonia and are part of the gradual transition from Bulgarian to Serbian. The Bulgarian Transitional dialects and the Serbian Prizren-Timok dialects are loosely characterised by mixed, predominantly Serbian phonology and predominantly Bulgarian morphology. The features described here are characteristic only of the Transitional dialects within Bulgaria.

It does not exist even in new words where it is usually replaced by v: –≤–µ–Ω–µ—Ä vs. Standard Bulgarian —Ñ–µ–Ω–µ—Ä (\\"lantern\\") Grammatical and morphological characteristics * Definiteness realized with post-positive articles. The definite articles are usually -—ä—Ç, -—Ç–∞, -—Ç–æ, -—Ç–µ as in standard Bulgarian * Breakup of the Old Bulgarian case system (as in standard Bulgarian).

He is also the owner and founder of the independent promotion Reality of Wrestling (ROW) in Texas City, Texas. Booker is best known for his time in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E), and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), holding 35 championships between those organizations. He is the most decorated wrestler in WCW history, having held 21 titles including a record six WCW World Television Championships (along with being the first African American titleholder), and a record eleven WCW World Tag Team Championships: ten as one half of Harlem Heat with his brother, Lash \\"Stevie Ray\\" Huffman in WCW (most reigns within that company), and one in the WWF with Test. Harlem Heat were recognized by WWE as being ‚Äì along with The Steiner Brothers ‚Äì WCW's greatest ever tag team. Booker was the final WCW World Heavyweight Champion and WCW United States Heavyweight Champion under the WCW banner in 2001; sports journalist Michael Landsberg stated that Booker was considered \\"one of the best wrestlers alive\\", capable of \\"any match, any style\\". Industry veteran John Layfield later described him as \\"the best acquisition that WWE got when they bought WCW\\". Booker is a six-time world champion, having won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship five times (the last of those wins occurring in the WWF), and WWE's World Heavyweight Championship once. He is the first non-mixed race African American to become a world champion in WWE, and was voted the greatest World Heavyweight Champion in a WWE viewer poll.The WWE Universe's picks for best champions ever. WWE. September 15, 2013. Retrieved September 16, 2013. Booker is also the winner of the 2006 King of the Ring tournament, the sixteenth Triple Crown Champion, and the eighth Grand Slam Champion (under original format) in WWE history. As the ninth WCW Triple Crown Champion, Booker is one of five men to achieve both the WWE and WCW Triple Crowns. He has headlined multiple pay-per-view events for the WWF/E, WCW and TNA throughout his career. Longtime wrestler Kurt Angle said of Booker: \\"He's done it all... he legitimately is one of the top five best of all time.\\" Booker was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2013, by his brother, Lash. Both he and Lash were inducted together into the 2019 class on April 6, 2019 as Harlem Heat, rendering Booker a two-time Hall of Famer. Early life Booker was born the youngest of eight children, in Plain Dealing, Louisiana, though his birthplace is often misidentified as Houston, Texas. By the time Booker was 13, both of his parents had died and he lived with his 16-year-old sister. He would move in with his older brother Lash \\"Stevie Ray\\" Huffman at age 17. In high school, Booker was a drum major. He also played football and basketball. Booker spent nineteen months in prison after pleading guilty to armed robberies at Wendy's restaurants in Houston. Booker and his partners wore Wendy's uniforms during the holdups since they had been working there for 2¬Ω years. Because of the gunmen's uniforms and familiarity with the fast food chain's operations, police suspected the robberies were inside jobs‚Äîand it did not take long before Huffman and three other men were found. Booker pleaded guilty in December 1987 to two aggravated robbery counts and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released after serving 19 months, and was placed on parole until April 1992. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1989‚Äì1993) As a single father working at a storage company in Houston, Texas, Huffman was looking to make a better life for himself and his son. His brother Lash (Stevie Ray) suggested that he and Booker check out a new wrestling school being opened, run by Ivan Putski, in conjunction with his Western Wrestling Alliance organization. His boss from the storage company sponsored the money to pay for the wrestling lessons. Booker trained under Scott Casey, who helped to turn Booker's background as a gangster and dancer into \\"sports entertainment\\", teaching the newcomer in-ring psychology and ring generalship. Eight weeks later, Booker debuted as \\"G.I. Bro\\" on Putski's Western Wrestling Alliance Live! program. The character was a tie-in to the raging Gulf War and the WWF's Sgt. Slaughter angle. Even though the WWA met its demise some time later, Booker continued to wrestle on the Texas independent circuit, often with his brother Lash, who performed as Stevie Ray. They were spotted by Skandor Akbar who hired them to work for the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), where he and Eddie Gilbert were involved. Gilbert teamed Stevie Ray and Booker T together as the Ebony Experience, and they won the GWF Tag Team Championship on July 31, 1992. During their time with GWF, they held the tag title a total of three times. Subsequently, Booker T and Stevie Ray left the GWF to work for World Championship Wrestling. World Championship WrestlingHarlem Heat (1993‚Äì1997)= Booker and his brother Stevie Ray signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after Sid Vicious recommended they sign with the company. In August 1993, they debuted as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They became heels and were on Harley Race and Col. Rob Parker's team in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl on September 19 against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (p.139) They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled. In 1994, they acquired the services of Sensational Sherri, dubbed 'Sister' Sherri, as their manager and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they held the WCW Tag Team Championship after defeating Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December. After dropping the title to The Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995. Afterward, Harlem Heat got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri.

Stevie neglected her help and started disputing with Booker over her. Stevie Ray eventually challenged Midnight in a match that decided whether or not she would stay with Harlem Heat. After being defeated with a surprise small package, Stevie Ray turned on both Booker and Midnight to form Harlem Heat, Inc. with Big T, Kash, and J. Biggs. Stevie Ray and Big T dubbed themselves Harlem Heat 2000. Throughout this period, Huffman was referred to simply as Booker, as Harlem Heat 2000 won the rights to the name \\"T\\" in a match with Big T against Booker on February 20, 2000 at SuperBrawl X.

After WCW booker Vince Russo grew disgruntled with Hulk Hogan's politics, he fired Hogan during the live broadcast of Bash at the Beach and announced an impromptu match between Jeff Jarrett and Huffman for the World Title.

Booker's next feud was with Scott Steiner, to whom he eventually lost the title in a Straitjacket steel cage match. Steiner won by TKO when he put an unconscious Booker into the Steiner Recliner at Mayhem. Steiner was WCW's longest reigning champion in years, whilst Booker was briefly out with an injury. Booker returned to the roster and defeated Rick Steiner for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship at Greed. This made Booker the ninth WCW Triple Crown winner.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (p.154) On the final episode of Nitro, he defeated Scott Steiner to win the World title for the fourth time.

World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001‚Äì2007)The Alliance (2001‚Äì2002)= After WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, Booker T made his debut at the King of the Ring pay-per-view in 2001 attacking WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin during his match, promptly injuring him in his very first move in the WWF. He later turned heel and became a leading member of The Alliance during the Invasion storyline. During July 2001, in his debut match in the company, Booker defended his WCW Championship against Buff Bagwell; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called this bout \\"the worst match ever\\". At InVasion, The Alliance defeated Team WWF when Steve Austin joined the Alliance. On July 26, Booker gave up his WCW United States Championship and handed it over to Chris Kanyon. He later lost the WCW World Championship to Kurt Angle, but he went on to win the title back on the July 30 episode of Raw. Booker kept the title until SummerSlam, when he lost it to The Rock after feuding with him over the similarity in their gimmicks and their identical finishing moves, the Book End/Rock Bottom.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (pp. 108‚Äì110) Booker T won the WCW World Tag Team Championship for an eleventh time, this time with Test, and he also had a WWF Tag Team Championship reign with Test. At the Survivor Series, Booker T was eliminated third by The Rock after a roll-up and eventually The Alliance was defeated, causing them to disband. In its aftermath, Booker remained a heel, and he joined forces with Vince McMahon and The Boss Man in December to feud with Steve Austin. After Booker T cost Austin a match against Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Vengeance, Austin gained revenge by attacking Booker T in a grocery store by covering him in food. Then the week after Booker T vandalized Austin's truck causing Austin to chase Booker T around a bingo hall and a church. Booker T's first WrestleMania appearance was at WrestleMania X8 against Edge, a match he lost. They feuded over who would appear in a fictional Japanese shampoo commercial. When the brand extension was introduced in March, Booker T was drafted to the Raw brand. At Insurrextion, Booker briefly held the WWF Hardcore Championship twice, defeating Stevie Richards only to lose it to Crash Holly seconds later. He then re-defeated Crash and lost the title to Stevie Richards a few minutes later. =Feud with Evolution (2002‚Äì2003)= Goldust began trying to start a tag team with Booker, but Goldust kept costing Booker matches. With the nWo now operating in WWE, Booker T was eventually invited into the faction. His time there was short-lived, when he was kicked out of the group by Shawn Michaels after a superkick from Michaels. Booker then turned face and found a partnership with Goldust and the pair teamed to battle the nWo. Booker and Goldust had a title shot against The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm) at SummerSlam, but The Un-Americans retained after interference from Test.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (p.111) At No Mercy, Booker and Goldust battled Chris Jericho and Christian for the tag titles, but they lost the match with Jericho using the title belt on Goldust. He spent the rest of 2002 teaming with Goldust. They won the World Tag Team Championship at Armageddon in a Tag Team Elimination match defeating the teams of Christian and Chris Jericho, Lance Storm and William Regal, and the Dudley Boyz. They held the belts for about three weeks, when they lost them to Regal and Storm. Booker and Goldust lost the rematch and decided to go their separate ways. The gimmick for Booker and Goldust was Goldust being a strange, yet dependable ally who Booker eventually warmed up to after initial skepticism. By 2003, however, Booker T's popularity had soared and he amicably separated from Goldust, at Goldust's request, in order to pursue the World Heavyweight Championship. In February 2003, he eliminated The Rock to win a battle royal for the number one contendership, granting him a title shot at WrestleMania XIX. Booker targeted Evolution after Batista and Randy Orton attacked Booker's former partner, Goldust. Several weeks before WrestleMania, the incumbent champion and Evolution's leader, Triple H, cut a controversial promo on Booker T. Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the WCW Championship had been held by non-wrestlers like booker Vince Russo and actor David Arquette, calling WCW and its title \\"a joke\\", despite the fact that, as World Heavyweight Champion, Triple H was holding the WCW Championship's physical belt, the Big Gold Belt, and that Triple H's Evolution stablemate, Ric Flair, had been a multiple-time WCW Champion. He said that \\"people like\\" Booker T would never win world championships in WWE. This promo is often interpreted as racist due to Triple H referencing Booker T's \\"nappy\\" hair and implying that Booker T was just in WWE to dance and entertain for \\"people like\\" Triple H. During the WrestleMania XIX press conference Michael Cole asked Triple H as to whether he had deliberately cut a racist promo, Triple H claimed this was not the case and that he was just referring to Booker's criminal past. A week later, Booker attacked Triple H in the bathroom and laid him out after Triple H had thrown a dollar bill at him, ordering Booker to get him a towel. However, Booker T lost to Triple H at WrestleMania XIX.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (pp. 112‚Äì113) For several weeks, he teamed with Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash in a feud against Triple H, Ric Flair, and Chris Jericho. At Backlash, Booker's team lost when Triple H pinned Nash after a sledgehammer shot. =Various feuds (2003‚Äì2005)= Afterward, Booker set his sights on the newly reactivated Intercontinental Championship. After losing a battle royal for the title at Judgment Day, Booker feuded with the champion Christian. After a few matches, Booker defeated Christian to become the new Intercontinental Champion on the July 7 episode of Raw. About a month later, because of a nagging back injury, Booker lost the Intercontinental title back to Christian at a non-televised house show on August 10. Booker, meanwhile, was out of action until October. Booker returned on the October 20 episode of Raw and subsequently joined Team Austin at Survivor Series for a match to determine whether Eric Bischoff or Stone Cold Steve Austin (both co-general managers) would be the sole General Manager of Raw. Team Bischoff won the match.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (p.114) Booker then feuded with Mark Henry, who eliminated him in the Survivor Series match. Booker defeated Henry at Armageddon. On the February 16, 2004 episode of Raw, Booker T and Rob Van Dam defeated Ric Flair and Batista for the World Tag Team Championship. Booker and Van Dam held the titles for a month, even defending the belts at WrestleMania XX in a 4 Corners tag team match. Eight days later on the March 22 episode of Raw, they lost tag team titles back to Flair and Batista. He and Rob Van Dam, never got their rematch due to Rob Van Dam being drafted to Smackdown! that very same night. On March 23, 2004 he was \\"traded\\" (along with the Dudley Boyz) to the SmackDown! brand in exchange for Triple H, but as part of a new storyline, he appeared unhappy with the move calling SmackDown! \\"the minor leagues\\" and even disrespected Eddie Guerrero, the brand's WWE Champion, turning heel in the process. Later on, Booker T bragged about how he was the biggest star on SmackDown! and feuded with The Undertaker. Booker tried to utilize voodoo magic to try to overcome his \\"supernatural\\" foe; however, it did nothing to prevent him from losing to the Undertaker at Judgment Day. In mid-2004, Booker T set his sights on the United States Championship along with its champion, John Cena. After Cena got on the bad side of General Manager Kurt Angle, he did his best to get the title away from Cena. Cena successfully defended the title at The Great American Bash in a four-way elimination match against Booker, Ren√© Dupr√©e, and Rob Van Dam.Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling's historical cards\\" (pp. 115‚Äì117) After Cena was stripped of his title by Angle for \\"laying a hand\\" on the GM, Booker took advantage of the situation and won an eight-man elimination match to win the vacant United States Championship, thus becoming the one-hundredth United States Champion in history, in a match that also featured Cena, Dupree, Billy Gunn, Charlie Haas, Luther Reigns, Kenzo Suzuki and Van Dam. Booker won by last eliminating both Cena and Van Dam in the course of less than 10 seconds After Angle was fired by Mr. McMahon for embellishing his injuries, Theodore Long began his first tenure as SmackDown! General Manager, and booked a best-of-five series of matches for the United States Championship between Booker and Cena. The first match took place at SummerSlam in Toronto and saw Cena gain the pinfall victory to go up 1‚Äì0 in the series. Booker would bounce back and win the next two matches, on the August 26 edition of SmackDown! in Fresno, California and a live event the next night in Sydney, Australia, to take a 2‚Äì1 lead. The next match in the series wouldn't come until the September 16 SmackDown! from Spokane, Washington, where Cena won and tied the series at two apiece. The series culminated at No Mercy, where Cena won the series 3‚Äì2, and thusly, the United States Championship.John Cena ‚Äì OWW . Onlineworldofwrestling.com (October 5, 2015). Retrieved November 19, 2017. On October 21, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long placed Booker in a six-man tag team match with Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio against John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield (JBL), Ren√© Dupr√©e, and Kenzo Suzuki. JBL expected Booker to betray his partners, but instead Booker pinned him, thus turning face again. Booker T faced JBL for the WWE Championship at the Survivor Series on November 14, but lost after he was hit in the head with the championship belt. The next night, Booker T demanded a rematch, citing Orlando Jordan's interference. He was then joined by Eddie Guerrero and The Undertaker who also wanted a shot at JBL's title, prompting Theodore Long to make a fatal four-way match for the WWE Championship at Armageddon. Once again, Booker failed to win the title, as JBL retained it. He then briefly teamed with Eddie Guerrero, at one point challenging Mysterio and Van Dam for the WWE Tag Team Championship, and feuded with Heidenreich. Booker won a 30-man Battle Royal dark match at WrestleMania 21 last eliminating Raw's Viscera and Chris Masters. Subsequently, Booker was part of the tournament to name a new number one contender and made it to the Final Four. After Kurt Angle eliminated Booker, he returned the favor, costing Angle the match against JBL. The storyline then turned to a sexual nature, as Angle began stalking Booker's new wife, Sharmell. Booker defeated Angle at Judgment Day. On the May 26 episode of SmackDown!, Booker participated in a \\"Winners Choice\\" Battle Royal, with the winner choosing his opponent for the next week. Kurt Angle won and wanted to wrestle Sharmell. Booker protested, and the match was made into a Handicap match. Angle won by pinning Sharmell in a sexual position. The next week, Booker gained revenge on Angle, defeating him with a Scissors Kick. Booker at Tribute to the Troops On the June 30 episode of SmackDown!, JBL defeated Christian, The Undertaker, Chris Benoit, Muhammad Hassan, and Booker T in a six-man elimination match for the SmackDown! Championship. During the match, Booker got specifically involved with Christian. Booker later defeated Christian at The Great American Bash. =United States Champion (2005‚Äì2006)= Booker T began teaming with Chris Benoit, eying his United States Championship again. Benoit was allowed to pick his next challenger to see who would face him at No Mercy, so Booker, Christian, and Orlando Jordan tried to impress Benoit by winning matches. He instead decided not choose one opponent, so he made it a fatal four-way for No Mercy, where Benoit successfully defended his title. On the October 21 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T defeated Benoit for the United States Championship, due to unseen help from Sharmell. Theodore Long later showed footage of Sharmell interfering in Booker's matches. Booker went to apologize to Benoit and give him a rematch, but then attacked Benoit, busting him open with the United States title belt and turning heel once again. Booker then boasted that he had been fully aware of what Sharmell had been doing and had been playing dumb to fool everyone. On the November 25 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T defended the United States Championship against Benoit. The match ended when Benoit superplexed Booker and two referees made a three count on either competitor, claiming that their wrestler had won. Booker was stripped of the belt by Theodore Long, because of the confusion of who won since they pinned each other at the same time. Long decided to put Benoit and Booker against each other in a best of seven series, just as the two had in their WCW days. Booker took an early 3‚Äì0 lead. In a must win match during Armageddon, Benoit was able to defeat Booker T to bring the series to 3‚Äì1. At a house show, Booker was injured, and he did not wrestle again until after the \\"Best of Seven\\" series with Benoit was completed. Booker was scheduled to face Benoit in Match 5 of the Best of Seven Series at the December 30 taping of SmackDown!. At the beginning of the show, General Manager Theodore Long said that Booker would have to forfeit. Both Booker and Benoit protested, with Benoit not wanting a cheap victory. Booker managed to persuade Long to allow him to choose a stand-in for the matches. Booker chose Randy Orton as his replacement. Benoit was able to tie the series 3‚Äì3 after beating Orton in two consecutive matches on the December 30 and January 6, 2006 episodes of SmackDown!. Orton, however, was able to defeat Benoit in the final match on the January 13 episode of SmackDown! to win the series and the title for Booker T, who held the title until No Way Out where Benoit won it back. On the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, Booker and Sharmell provided guest commentary for a match involving The Boogeyman. After defeating his opponents, Boogeyman dumped a bucket of worms onto the announce table where they were sitting, frightening the two. Over the next few weeks, Boogeyman would stalk Booker and Sharmell. Booker and Boogeyman were set to face off on the March 18 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, but the match was canceled due to Booker faking a knee injury to escape competition. The feud eventually culminated at WrestleMania 22, with Booker and Sharmell losing to Boogeyman. The couple received a restraining order against The Boogeyman on the April 7 episode of SmackDown!, ending the feud. =King Booker and World Heavyweight Champion (2006‚Äì2007)= Booker next entered the 2006 King of the Ring tournament on SmackDown!, advancing through to the finals due to a bye as his semi-final opponent, Kurt Angle, was unable to wrestle. The finals were held at Judgment Day where Booker defeated Bobby Lashley. Upon winning the King of the Ring tournament, Booker began wrestling as \\"King Booker\\" and began acting like he was an actual monarch ruling \\"The SmackDown! Kingdom\\". Booker formed a royal court that included his wife, Queen Sharmell, Sir William Regal, and Sir Finlay, and began including the mannerisms and attire of a stereotypical English-style king as part of the character, all the way down to wearing a crown and cape and speaking in a fake English accent. However, whenever King Booker would get angry he would launch into a tirade in the style of Booker T (an example of this was an episode of Smackdown! where Theodore Long would inform him he would be facing The Undertaker), which lent some comedic aspect to the character; he even went as far as having Lashley kiss his \\"royal\\" feet. King Booker's signature pose After gaining his title of King, Booker continued to feud with Lashley. After Lashley defeated JBL for the United States Championship at the end of May, Booker began chasing after the title and even resorted to making Lashley kiss his \\"royal feet\\" on the June 2 SmackDown!. The feud ended after a steel cage match on the June 30 SmackDown! where Lashley escaped to retain the United States title. The next week, King Booker entered a battle royal on SmackDown! with the winner to challenge Rey Mysterio for his World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash. Booker won the match and then defeated Mysterio after Chavo Guerrero turned on the champion by hitting him with a steel chair. This was Booker's first world championship since joining WWE and the win caused him to proclaim himself as the \\"King of the World\\". This win would also make Booker the sixteenth Triple Crown Champion and eighth Grand Slam Champion (under original format) in the history of the WWE. After Booker won, he began a rivalry with the returning former champion Batista, who vowed to regain the title he was forced to forfeit due to injury. This rivalry spilled over to real life when the two got into a legitimate fistfight at a SummerSlam pay-per-view commercial shoot, reportedly due to Batista considering himself superior to the rest of the roster due to his quick climb to main event status. According to sources, both men were left bloodied and bruised, however Booker was reportedly praised by many wrestlers in the back for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude. At SummerSlam, King Booker lost to Batista by disqualification after Queen Sharmell interfered on his behalf, but at No Mercy, Booker defeated Batista, Lashley and his own stablemate, Finlay, in a Fatal 4-Way match. After the match, King Booker assaulted Sir Regal, resulting in the breakup of the King's Court. Despite the break-up of his Court, King Booker lost to Batista by disqualification on the October 20 episode on SmackDown!, due to interference from WWE Champion John Cena from Raw and ECW World Champion Big Show, the two of whom King Booker was to face at Cyber Sunday in a \\"champion of champions\\" match. The fans voted for the World Heavyweight Championship to be on the line. Booker retained after defeating Cena with help from Kevin Federline. After Cyber Sunday, the feud between King Booker and Batista continued with Batista unable to wrest the title from Booker. Eventually this led to a match at Survivor Series on November 26, where King Booker declared that if Batista failed to defeat him this time, it would be the last World Heavyweight Championship match he would receive. On the night of the show, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long decided that if King Booker got counted out or disqualified, Batista would become champion. Late in the match, Queen Sharmell handed King Booker his title belt while referee Nick Patrick was not looking. While she had Patrick distracted, the King attempted to hit Batista with the belt. Batista moved out of the way, knocked the belt out of Booker's hands and hit the champion in the head, allowing him to score the pinfall. After losing the World title, Booker feuded alongside former royal court member Finlay against Batista and John Cena, which led up to Armageddon where they lost. While competing in the Royal Rumble match, Booker was eliminated by Kane. A frustrated Booker returned to the ring illegally and eliminated Kane. This started a short feud between the two resulting in a match at No Way Out, which Kane won. On the February 23 episode of SmackDown!, King Booker won a Falls Count Anywhere Money in the Bank qualifying match, defeating Kane (with assistance from The Great Khali) and earned himself a spot in the match at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, Matt Hardy set up Sharmell for a Twist of Fate during the Money in the Bank match with the briefcase in King Booker's grasp ‚Äì thus forcing him to choose between a guaranteed title shot and his wife. He chose to defend his Queen and lost the match. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown!, Booker attempted to take revenge. However, he lost the match against Matt Hardy, and Sharmell declared her disappointment in him and slapped him. In an attempt to impress his Queen, King Booker attacked The Undertaker but was Tombstoned on an announce table. Booker was removed from television to deal with a knee injury. On the June 11 episode of Raw, King Booker and Queen Sharmell were drafted to the Raw brand as part of the WWE Draft. On July 16, King Booker came to the ring using Triple H's theme music \\"The King of Kings\\", even using his video. King Booker declared that neither Triple H nor Jerry Lawler could be known as \\"The King\\". Booker began a feud with Lawler, defeating him on the August 6 episode of Raw where the loser had to crown the winner the next week. When the time came, Lawler refused, declaring that Triple H was still a king and announcing that King Booker would battle Triple H at SummerSlam. Booker attacked Lawler, throwing him into the ring post and hitting him with a television monitor. At SummerSlam, Booker lost to the returning Triple H. On the August 27 episode of Raw, Booker wrestled against WWE Champion John Cena in a non-title match, which he lost by disqualification when Randy Orton interfered. In August, he was linked to Signature Pharmacy, a company thought to be distributing performance-enhancing drugs. He was suspended by WWE for violating its Wellness Policy. He denied using any drugs and being a customer of Signature Pharmacy. In October 2007, Booker T requested his and Sharmell's release from their WWE contracts due to the pressure he had in WWE and being burned out, which WWE granted.https://411mania.com/wrestling/booker-t-wwe-leave-2007/ Total Nonstop Action WrestlingFeud with Bobby Roode (2007‚Äì2008)= TNA At the Genesis pay-per-view on November 11, 2007, Huffman debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Sting's mystery partner in a tag team match against Kurt Angle and Kevin Nash for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, reverting to his Booker T character. His wife Sharmell also debuted, interfering in the match on Booker and Sting's behalf when Karen Angle interfered on behalf of Kurt Angle and Nash. On the November 29 episode of Impact!, Booker said he came to TNA to test his skills against the young talent, take TNA to a higher level, and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Robert Roode came to the ring and challenged Booker to a match, claiming he has been pushed down by washed-up wrestlers and has-beens. Booker won his Impact! debut match, but afterwards, Christian Cage and Robert Roode beat down Booker until Kaz made the save. At Turning Point, Booker and Kaz defeated Roode and Cage when Booker pinned Cage. Booker and Sharmell won a mixed tag team match against Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks at Final Resolution. After the match, Roode punched Sharmell in the face, leading to a match at Against All Odds. While the punch was intended to be a work, Roode had in fact made contact with Sharmell during the punch, dislocating her jaw and causing her to be off TV for a few weeks, therefore making it into a shoot. The rivalry, however, went ahead as planned where Booker and Roode wrestled to a double-countout at Against All Odds, which saw them brawl to the parking lot. Roode defeated Booker in strap match at Destination X after hitting Booker with a pair of handcuffs.

Early life He was born on November 24, 1870 to David Wolfe Bishop (1833‚Äì1900) and Florence Van Corltandt Field (1851‚Äì1922). His younger brother was David Wolfe Bishop Jr. His father inherited the greater part of the wealth of Catharine Lorillard Wolfe. His maternal grandparents were Benjamin Hazard Field and Catharine Van Cortlandt de Peyster. His paternal grandparents were Japhet Bishop and Harriet Matilda Wolfe. After his father's death, his mother married John Edward Parsons, a distinguished lawyer in New York. He earned an A.B. from Columbia University in 1891, an A.M. in 1892, a Ph.D. in 1893, and an LL.B. in 1894. Career In 1893, he published a book on American colonial voting practices.Bishop CF (1893). History of Elections in the American Colonies. Franklin, Burt Publisher In July 1902, he gave automobile lessons to the Cottagers of Lenox and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in response to criticism of the use of automobile. In 1903, Cortlandt and his brother, David, were hurt in an automobile accident where they collided with a carriage while David was driving. Cortlandt was bruised and sustained a bad wound on his cheek while David was battered and bruised, while the car suffered only minor damage. In 1909, as president of the Aero Club of America, Bishop offered a $250 prize to the first four persons who could fly one kilometer. During the International Aviation Meet in 1910, Bishop, Charles K. Hamilton, and Anthony J. Drexel, Jr. were all separately arrested for speeding in Jamaica, Queens. In 1911, Bishop and his wife took an extensive automobile trip around Europe, traveling to the Tripolitan frontier, 480 kilometers from Tunis. American Art Association In 1923, Bishop bought America's premier auction house, American Art Association, from Thomas Kirby and installed Maj. Hiram Haney Parke and Otto Bernet as vice presidents and then proceeded to run his business from all over the world. In 1929, The Association merged with the Anderson Auction Company to form the American Art Association-Anderson Galleries, Inc. In August 1938, the firm was bought from Bishop's estate by Parke-Bernet Galleries, which had been formed a year earlier by Bishop's former auctioneers. In 1964, Sotheby's purchased Parke-Bernet, then the largest auctioneer of fine art in the United States. Real estate In 1903, he purchased land and the 1879 row house that occupied it at 15 East 67th Street in New York City for $235,000. He and his wife then hired noted architect, Ernest Flagg, who had designed the Singer Building and the Corcoran Gallery, to design their townhouse, which was built in 1904. In 1907, after the death of Matilda W. White (n√©e Bishop), his aunt and the widow of Joseph Moss White who some said was deranged, Bishop was named trustee of her estate, valued at $3,546,558. Through the will of his aunt, he was conveyed certain real estate properties which he managed under Cortlandt Bishop, Inc. In 1925, the company leased, from the estate of Frederick Heimsoth, the plot at the southwest corner of 56th Street and Sixth Avenue, giving him the entire block front from 55th to 56th on Sixth Avenue, upon which he planned to build a 15-story apartment building, which was completed in 1928. In 1922, after the death of his mother, Bishop razed his parents home, Interlaken, in Lenox and built Ananda Hall, which was torn down in 1940. In 1929, Bishop sold two five- story tenement buildings at 986 and 988 Sixth Avenue to Herrman Friedman, president of Sofmar Realty Corporation, that had been owned by the Bishop family for over 40 years. In 1933, Bishop gave himself, as surviving trustee, a $225,000 mortgage through Cortlandt Bishop, Inc. on 1305 6th Avenue. He also owned a three-story residence on East 35th Street which was bought in 1939 and torn down, together with 31-33 East Street, so a new Georgian structure could be built. Personal life The Rape of the Sabine Women (1574‚Äì82), Florence In 1899, Bishop married Amy Bend (1870-1957), sister of Beatrice Bend (1874-1941), who married Henry Prather Fletcher, both daughters of George H. Bend, a member of the New York Stock Exchange who had gone bankrupt. She was introduced into society in 1889 and was a close friend of Emily Vanderbilt Sloane. Amy was rumored to have been close to marrying John Jacob Astor III, and later became engaged to A. Lanfear Norrie, which was announced at a grand ball on April 23, 1893, but which Amy broke off less than a month later. The broken engagement was followed by a brief courtship with William Kissam Vanderbilt, who at the time, was old enough to be her father. After their marriage, Cortlandt and Amy had one child: * Beatrice Bishop Berle (1902‚Äì1993), an author and prominent doctor who married Adolf A. Berle, Jr. (1895‚Äì1971), a diplomat. After his death, she married Dr. Andr√© Fr√©d√©ric Cournand (1895‚Äì1988), a physician who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. He died on March 30, 1935 in Lenox, Massachusetts. After his death, the Bishop's New York townhouse was sold Anna Erickson, widow of the chairman of McCann-Erickson in 1936 and, today, is the home of the Regency Whist Club. His estate was valued at $2,847,201 with a net value of $499,392, which accounted for debts, mortgages, administrative expenses and a $515,000 payment to his daughter in settlement of an action she brought for an accounting of Bishop's trusteeship of a fund in which she had an interest. His principal beneficiary was his widow and a friend, Edith Nixon. Bishop was found to have improperly handled the estate of Matilda W. White, his aunt, who left an estate of $3,546,558. Legacy In November 1935, his auction house, American Art Association-Anderson Galleries, sold his paintings and furniture for $276,145. The sale included two Hoppner portraits, a half-length portrait of Miss Rich, a young woman in a white gown, and the painter's study of the 2nd Earl of Chichester, painted about 1795. It also included a portrait of Lady Cholmondeley by Sir Joshua Reynolds, six Aubusson tapestries, Giovanni Da Bologna's Rape of a Sabine, a sculptured marble bas-relief of the Virgin and Child by Bernardo Rossellino, a Chippendale carved walnut scroll-top chest, among others. In 1938 and 1939, Bishop's extensive stamp and book collection was sold.Staff report (December 8, 1948). RARE BOOK OF 1501 SOLD FOR $24,000; Aesop 'Fables' of Collection of C.F.

He specialized in the study of the family Cactaceae. He studied geology and natural history at the Etablissement G√©ographique de Bruxelles, where he graduated in 1835 with an award-winning dissertation on the geology of Brabant. After graduation, he spent the next five years in Mexico performing geological and botanical research. Here he collected numerous new species of plants, particularly cacti. In 1840 Galeotti was offered a position teaching botany at the University of Brussels, but turned down the offer, preferring to work at his nursery outside of Brussels, from where he imported Mexican flora for sell in Europe. During this time period, he collaborated with botanist Martin Martens (1797-1863) on scientific study of species native to Mexico. In 1853 he became director of the Jardin botanique de Bruxelles (Botanical Garden of Brussels), a position he maintained until his death in 1858 from tuberculosis.JSTOR Global Plants (biography) In 1852 he became editor of the Journal d'Horticulture Pratique, and in 1857 created the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Royale d‚ÄôHorticulture de Belgique et du Jardin botanique de Bruxelles.

It originates in the cerebellar nuclei, crosses completely in the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, bypasses the red nucleus, and terminates in posterior division of ventral lateral nucleus of thalamus. The ventrolateral nucleus has different divisions and distinct connections, mostly with frontal and parietal lobes. The primary motor cortex and premotor cortex get information from the ventrolateral nucleus projections originating in the interposed nucleus and dentate nuclei. Other dentate nucleus projections via thalamic pathway transmit information to prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The cerebellum sends thalamocortical projections and in addition may also send connections from the thalamus to association areas serving cognitive and affective functions. It is mostly separated from the pallidothalamic tracts. It can play a role in mediating symptoms in hereditary dystonia. The term \\"cerebellothalamocortical pathway\\" is used to indicate termination in the cerebral cortex.  Function  The cerebellothalamic tract transmits information from the cerebellum to the thalamus via neural impulses for the sensory systems. Motor adaptation is primarily a function of the cerebellothalamic fiber pathway. The cerebellum oversees modification of routine motor programs in response to changes in the environment (e.g. walking uphill versus walking on a flat surface). It is experimentally shown that prolonged motor adaptation, such as walking over a period of weeks while wearing an ankle cast, is accompanied by long-term potentiation of cerebellothalamic synapses, thereby facilitating the influence of the cerebellum on the motor cortex.  Clinical significance  Lesions in cerebrocerebellum, which receives input exclusively from the cerebral cortex and projects its output to premotor and motor cortices, result in impairments in highly skilled sequences of learned movements, for instance, playing a musical instrument. Lesions may also result in problems with planning movements and ipsilateral incoordination, especially of the upper limb and to faulty phonation and articulation. Pathological interaction between cerebellothalamic tract and basal ganglia may be the explanation for the resting tremor in Parkinson's disease.

Although praised by newspapers for reducing the level of overt violence and graft which plagued the union under his predecessor, William Quesse, Horan nonetheless still engaged in bribery, extortion, physical intimidation, and other crimes, and permitted George Scalise (his successor) to enter and rise within the organization. Horan established the kickback scheme whereby Scalise would eventually loot the union treasury of millions of dollars in member dues.\\"Scalise Jury Gets 2 Success Stories,\\" New York Times, August 16, 1940. Early years Jerry Horan was born to John and Mary Horan McLeod in May 1886. He was one of eight children, and raised a Roman Catholic. He married the former Nonie Corbett, and the couple had a daughter, Helen. He became a lifelong member of the Loyal Order of Moose, the Knights of Columbus, and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Early organized crime involvement By the time he was in his mid 30s, Jerry Horan had been heavily involved in organized crime for several years.\\"Murphy, Shea, Mader Hit As Killers Talk,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 16, 1922. He owned a saloon near the corner of South Wood Street and West Van Buren Street in Chicago (the site is now a parking lot opposite Malcolm X College).\\"Developments to Date; Clearing Bomb Mystery,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 16, 1922. Horan led a gang of bombers, gunmen and \\"sluggers\\" (men who would beat others to intimidate them) which was in the employ of various organized crime outfits and labor unions. Among his clients were mobster and labor leader Timothy \\"Big Tim\\" Murphy, mobster Fred Mader, and mobster and labor leader Cornelius Shea (who was international president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters). Horan was hired by his uncle, BSEIU President William Quesse, as an organizer in 1921.\\"Horan Installed as Head of Flat Janitors' Union.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune. September 7, 1927. His primary job, however, was to act as Quesse's chauffeur.Fitch, Solidarity For Sale, 2006. On May 6, 1922, Horan, Shea, Murphy, and five other labor leaders and labor racketeers were arrested and charged with the murder of a Chicago police officer. Horan was accidentally released, and went into hiding‚Äîalthough the press reported that he had turned state's evidence and been freed for rendering assistance. On May 24, the state asked for nolle prosequi and the court agreed to withdraw the indictments.\\"200 Labor Chiefs Arrested in Chicago After Two Policemen Are Shot Dead And Industrial Plants Are Bombed,\\" New York Times, May 11, 1922; \\"Labor Chiefs Seized in Effort to End Murders by Gangsters,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 11, 1922; \\"Rush To Indict Chicago Laborites,\\" New York Times, May 12, 1922; \\"Eight Labor Chiefs Indicted In Chicago To Block Release,\\" New York Times, May 12, 1922; \\"Raid Bomb Factory in Chicago's War On Labor Terror,\\" New York Times, May 13, 1922; \\"Get New Evidence On Labor Bombings,\\" New York Times, May 15, 1922; \\"'Big 3' of Chicago Labor To Be Tried,\\" New York Times, June 10, 1922; \\"Shea, Member of 'Big 3,' And Two Others Get Bail,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 13, 1922; \\"'Big 3' Denied Separate Trials On Terror Plot,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 18, 1922; Kinsley, \\"Trial Nears Climax,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 29, 1922.

By 1924, Horan had become a Republican and was active in GOP politics in Illinois, supporting Governor Len Small.\\"Labor Finds Its Small Bosters Are Discredited,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 7, 1924. BSEIU presidency Oscar Nelson, who had succeeded Quesse as president of BSEIU in February 1927, resigned his union office for health reasons on September 3, 1927.Wren, \\"Horan Succeeds Oscar Nelson As Janitors' Chief,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 4, 1927. Jerry Horan was formally elected Nelson's successor on September 6, 1927. Horan's brother-in-law, local Sheet Metal Workers' International Association president William J. \\"Wild Bill\\" Rooney‚Äîan alleged murderer and noted crime figure in the city‚Äîengineered Horan's accession to the union presidency. Horan quickly began a campaign of Americanism in BSEIU, pushing his members to learn English and become American citizens.Wren, \\"Plans Council to Lead Fight on Open Shop,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 14, 1930. By the fall of 1929, his political fortunes within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) had risen to the point where he was named a member of the AFL delegation to the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress.Evans, \\"Galpin's Ward Is Reorganized,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, November 8, 1929. Horan's political activity also continued. He took over the Cook County Wage Earner's League, a quasi-political action committee established by William Quesse in 1924 to promote pro-labor candidates for office.\\"Gambling Salon Operates Wide Open Near City Hall,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 19, 1928.\\"Hunt for Murder Clew in Past of Slain Union Boss,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 20, 1931. He was a prominent supporter of Republican William \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson during his successful run for Mayor of Chicago in 1927, and was elected chairman of the Republican Party's 27th Ward Committee in November 1929. He backed Republican Governor Louis Emmerson's plan to pass a state constitutional amendment legalizing an income tax,Hewitt, \\"Labor of City Backs Proposed Tax Amendment,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, October 21, 1930. and supported Charles W. Brooks in that candidate's unsuccessful run as the Republican candidate for governor of Illinois in 1936.\\"Labor, Business and Civic Heads Support Brooks,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, October 27, 1936. However, Horan used the Wage Earners' League to not only promote candidates for office (allegedly through intimidation and vote-rigging) but also to run an illegal gambling operation near Chicago City Hall. New member organizing was initially not very high on Horan's list of priorities. He established a union of maids and butlers in December 1927, but shuttered it less than six months later.\\"Union of Maids and Butlers Put Out of Business,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 2, 1928. He also established a council of trade union leaders to identify and respond to the open shop movement, but the council never engaged in any activity. Organized crime infiltration of BSEIU Although Horan won praise from Chicago newspapers for eliminating the worst and most obvious forms of violence, intimidation, and graft in the union, his ties to organized crime actually deepened. Horan's uncle, \\"Wild Bill\\" Rooney, had virtually taken control of the BSEIU's Chicago locals with Horan's approval within by the end of 1928.\\"Union Boss Slain By Gang In Chicago,\\" New York Times, March 20, 1931. In 1933, Horan was accused by former Illinois Attorney General Edward J. Brundage of consorting with gangster Al Capone and seeking to improperly influence James H. Wilkerson, the judge overseeing Capone's 1931 tax evasion trial.\\"Capone Effort to Influence Judge Charged,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, February 25, 1933; Ator, \\"Admits Perjury in Racket Trial,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, February 24, 1934; Wright, \\"Nelson Quizzed About Meeting With Al Capone,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 20, 1934. Horan, however, initially attempted to avoid being put under the influence of Capone and his Chicago Outfit. Capone sought control BSEIU in order to embezzle funds from the national union's treasury.Biles, Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago, 1984; Bukowski, Big Bill Thompson, Chicago, and the Politics of Image, 1997. But Big Tim Murphy had been gunned down in 1928,\\"Big Tim,\\" Time, July 9, 1928. leaving Horan without protection. Horan could not turn to Chicago Mayor Bill Thompson, either, for Thompson was closely linked to the Capone mob. Although labor leaders like the now-deceased William Rooney had broken with Thompson, Horan had not‚Äîand could not expect Thompson to protect him from Capone. In desperation, Horan moved to Chicago's northwest suburbs in the late 1920s in an attempt to escape Capone's influence. But when Capone sought him out again, Horan turned to bootlegger and gangster Roger Touhy, who controlled Chicago's northwest suburbs and was already engaged in a battle with Capone. According to Touhy and other sources, Horan and leaders of the Teamsters, Painters and other unions approached Touhy in 1929 and sought protection from Capone. Horan brought $125,000 in cash (raised from the union leaders) to buy Touhy's assistance, which Touhy agreed to provide.Roger Touhy, The Stolen Years, 1959.John William Touhy, When Capone's Mob Murdered Roger Touhy: The Strange Case of \\"Jake the Barber\\" and the Kidnapping That Never Happened, 2001.\\"Touhy Accuses Cop in $40,000 Capone Payoff,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 10, 1949.\\"Touhy Relates How Syndicate Invaded Unions,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 20, 1952.\\"Gangster Says Unions Paid to Fight Capone,\\" United Press International, September 20, 1952.\\"Cites Gilbert Link to Labor Rackets,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 10, 1954. But after Wild Bill Rooney's murder in March 1931, a frightened Horan (who was terrified even of his own bodyguards) made peace with Capone. In April 1933, Horan met with North Side Gang member Ted Newberry and turned over control of BSEIU over to Capone‚Äîtaking his day-to-day orders from Murray \\"The Camel\\" Humphreys, Capone's liaison to unions.\\"Scalise Sentenced to 10 to 20 Years,\\" New York Times, October 8, 1940. In 1934, the Capone mob forced Horan to hire George Scalise as a union organizer. Scalise, a 38-year-old from New York City, had been involved in interstate prostitution, labor racketeering and other organized crime activities since the early 1920s.

Scalise had used his mob connections to establish several small union locals with the Teamsters.Dwyer, \\"How Murderers Rode to Rule in Elevator Union,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 23, 1943. With Carfano's help, he then built several large locals of building janitors and elevator operators, began skimming members' dues and receiving kickbacks from employers, and then affiliated the locals with the BSEIU. In 1934, Scalise asked Carfano to use his Chicago Outfit connections to help Scalise become the Eastern Representative for BSEIU, a position which put him in control of all BSEIU locals on the East Coast. Horan agreed to the deal, and Scalise was not only appointed to the position but Scalise also received 50 percent of the dues from any newly organized members in the East.\\"Scalise Sentenced to 10 to 20 Years,\\" New York Times, October 8, 1940; Doherty, \\"Scalise, Pride Salved, Talks About Himself,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 28, 1940; \\"Aids Tell How Scalise Ruled Union Treasury,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 4, 1940; \\"Says Scalise Got $2,000 A Month,\\" New York Times, August 9, 1940; \\"Tell Three Year Take of Scalise As Trial Nears,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 9, 1940.\\"List Scalise's Withdrawals At $1,500,000,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 3, 1940. In 1935, when the Fifth Vice President position on the BSEIU Board of Directors opened up due to a retirement, Scalise worked with Carfano and Horan to win appointment to the position. Despite Horan's deepening relationship with organized crime, he was warmly embraced by the AFL. In December 1935, AFL President William Green was the keynote speaker at a testimonial dinner in Horan's honor.\\"Green, A.F.L. Chief, Speaks at Dinner for Jerry Horan,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, December 15, 1935. Because of Horan's mob connections, BSEIU grew tremendously during Horan's presidency. The mob received more money the more union members there were, so there was every incentive to bring in new members. Mob enforcers intimidated employers into permitting unionization of their employees, and existing locals swelled with members while new locals proliferated. BSEIU grew from 10,000 members in 1932 to 40,000 members in 1936 and 75,000 members in 1939.Slater, Public Workers: Government Employee Unions, the Law, and the State, 1900-1962, 2004. The union also grew through affiliations. Many of these affiliations were coerced, however. In one notorious case, Horan raided a Chicago local of the International Union of Elevator Constructors led by Matthew Taylor.\\"Slay Capone Aid In His Car,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 6, 1939.\\"Gang Rule of Union Bared!\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, September 7, 1940. Horan wanted the elevator operators to support strikes by building workers, and he wanted Taylor's union in BSEIU. Horan sent mobster Louis Schiavone to threaten Taylor in 1936, but this tactic failed. In early 1937, Horan and mobster Louis Campagna met Taylor at the Bismarck Hotel (171 West Randolph Street in Chicago) and offered him $50,000 in cash to voluntarily affiliate his union with BSEIU. Taylor refused the offer.\\"Mulcting of Chicago Service Union Revealed in Deathbed Confession,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1940. Horan kept up the pressure on Taylor in various ways, and Taylor finally gave in. Horan arranged for Taylor to meet with Oscar Nelson, George Scalise, Harry Bates (president of the Bricklayers union), and AFL President William Green after a meeting of the AFL executive council in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in August 1937. At the meeting, Green told Taylor that the AFL also believed the elevator operators should affiliate to BSEIU. Convinced that Horan had managed to intimidate even the powerful AFL president, Taylor agreed to affiliate his localwith BSEIU in September 1937. Green and Nelson later denied that any such meeting had occurred. New York City strike A major event during Horan's presidency was a strike that BSEIU conducted in 1936 in New York City. But despite being International President, Horan played only a minor role in the strike. The strike began on March 1, 1936, with the union seeking a closed shop and a $2-a-week pay increased.\\"Each Side Digs In For War In Building Strike,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 7, 1936.\\"Strikers Agree to Arbitration in N.Y. Tieup,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 9, 1936. Although only 5,000 workers initially walked off the job, five days later another 11,000 BSEIU members had joined them.\\"N.Y. Fights All Night to End Building Tieup,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 5, 1936.\\"Union Chiefs Here Doubt Plan to Call Nation-Wide Strike,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 5, 1936. The strike was so important and widespread that Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia became personally involved in the negotiations. On March 6, the strike spread to 17 hotels in New York City in addition to the 1,964 apartment buildings which were affected. Horan did not become publicly involved in the strike until the fifth day. He issued no press releases, made no speeches, and pledged no support. When Horan finally did make a statement, he pledged to lead all building workers nationwide out on strike in support of the New York City workers. His statement was considered so preposterous, however, that a day later he withdrew his promise and said that BSEIU would merely pledge \\"unlimited\\" funds to support the strike (yet another claim few believed). \\"Building Tieup Spreads,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 6, 1936. Horan attempted to fly to New York City on March 6 to personally take charge of the strike, but he was forced to divert his chartered flight to Boston after New York City authorities declared the city closed to him. On the sixth day of the strike it became clear that George Scalise and not Jerry Horan was in control of BSEIU. Scalise forced the owners of 45 buildings to settle on his terms late on March 6.\\"Strikers Win Agreement in Chain of 45 Buildings,\\" New York Times, March 7, 1936. The press, meanwhile, accused Horan of being in cahoots with Al Capone and recently deceased Louis \\"Two Guns\\" Alterie, forcing Horan to stay in Boston in order to avoid tainting the strikers' cause.\\"Horan Here Denies Link to Capone,\\" New York Times, March 8, 1936. Horan weakly claimed that he had purposefully flown to Boston to avoid any appearance that the strike was being run from Chicago and not New York.\\"Hotels Tied Up As N.Y. Building Strike Spreads,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 8, 1936. The strike spread to another 50 hotels on March 8 as Scalise announced that the union had signed another 1,814 apartment buildings to contracts. Local union officials said it would not look good if the strike were perceived to be led from Chicago. On March 9, both sides agreed to settle the strike‚Äîwhich still affected more than 300 buildings out of more than 2,195 struck‚Äîby arbitration (a proposal the union had made on March 2). Mayor LaGuardia was named the arbitrator, and within 24 hours he proposed a \\"preferential shop.\\"Under LaGuardia's scheme, employers would be forced to go to the union first when hiring new workers, and seek workers on the open labor market only if the union had no members able to work. This time, Horan was at least consulted before the arbitration proposal was agreed to.\\"Both Sides Agree to Discuss Peace in Service Strike,\\" New York Times, March 9, 1936. But when the employers balked at LaGuardia's solution, the strike continued.\\"New Peace Offer By Owners Is Seen As Strike Spreads,\\" New York Times, March 11, 1936. Scalise struck all buildings and hotels around Grand Central Station and Times Square on March 10 (adding another 300 buildings to those struck, bringing the total to more than 2,500). The strike's expansion proved too much for the employers,\\"All-Night Parley On Strike Brings Agreement Nearer,\\" New York Times, March 12, 1936. and an agreement on the union's terms was reached on March 14.\\"Service Strike Is Settled By the Mayor's New Board,\\" New York Times, March 15, 1936; \\"Service Employes Back On Job Today,\\" New York Times, March 16, 1936. Death In April 1937, Horan fell seriously ill and was thought to be dying. Scalise contacted Carfano, who agreed to try to have Scalise appointed president of BSEIU if Horan died. The week before Horan's death, a group of gangsters‚Äîwhich included Mike Carozza, Frank Diamond, Charles Fischetti, and labor racketeer Thomas J. Burke‚Äîmet with George Scalise at the Caf√© Capri restaurant at 123 North Clark Street in Chicago (a favorite hangout of Chicago Outfit leader Frank Nitti).\\"Gangland Rule of Union Told By Pay-Off Man,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 21, 1940.Wendt, \\"How Labor Is Hijacked,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 17, 1941. The meeting had been called to decide who should be the next president of the BSEIU in the event of Horan's death. The conspirators supported Burke, who was the Third Vice President of BSEIU, and a well-known labor racketeer.Strong, \\"Burke's Ouster Ends Labor Era,\\" Chicago Tribune, July 23, 1973. Burke had the backing of a majority of the mob figures, but the group felt he would be opposed by a majority of the BSEIU Board of Directors due to his public ties with organized crime. William McFetridge, BSEIU First Vice President, was believed to be the choice of the Board.Fulton, \\"Judge Told How Scalise Tapped Union Treasury,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 9, 1940. McFetridge was known for his scrupulous honesty, and although he had served on the Board for many years he was a figurehead and not part of the mob's inner circle of decision-makers. The mob, however, felt he was not acceptable because he was not under the control of organized crime. During the meeting, the conspirators settled on Scalise as Horan's successor. Scalise's ties to the Chicago Outfit were not well known to the members of the Board or the public, and this became the reason why he was chosen as the compromise candidate.\\"Scalise Hired to Loot Union, State Charges,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 13, 1940; Hartmann, \\"Call Janitors Convention to Block Hoodlums,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, March 27, 1942. The mob council told Scalise he would draw a salary of $1,000 a month, and he was told to kick back $500 a month to the Chicago Outfit. Scalise later denied being at the meeting as well as knowing Fischetti or Burke, but union documents proved him wrong.Financial records introduced by New York state prosecutors at Scalise's 1940 trial for theft and forgery showed that in February 1939, Scalise, Carfano, Fischetti and Burke all took a trip to Havana, Cuba together, in direct contradiction of Scalise's claim that he had never met Carfano or Fischetti. See: \\"Scalise Accuser Tells Death Fear,\\" New York Times, August 28, 1940; Fulton, \\"Reveal Scalise Paid Gangsters' Bills in Havana,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 28, 1940. On April 20, 1937, Jerry Horan was removed by ambulance from his apartment home at the Cornelia Apartments at 3500 N. Lake Shore Drive and taken to Passavant Hospital. Jerry Horan died there on April 27, 1937, of liver failure. Five thousand people attended his funeral at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Chicago. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery, where more than 30 automobiles were needed to deliver flowers to the grave. The afternoon of the funeral, the BSEIU board of directors met to elect the next president of the union. Included in the meeting were First Vice President McFetridge; Second Vice President Gus Van Heck; Third Vice President Burke; Fourth Vice President Charles Hardy;Hardy was generally considered honest and a figurehead who was not part of the mob's inner circle on the board. In 1939, Burke and his allies ran a candidate who defeated Hardy for re-election to the BSEIU board of directors. Hardy regained his seat in 1942. His son, George, was elected SEIU president in 1971.

He spent most of his maturity with Queen Henrietta's Men, but finished his career with the King's Men. With the former company, he was one of \\"those of principal note,\\" according to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), one of the troupe's \\"eminent actors.\\" Bowyer, the son of a John Bowyer, was christened on 20 September 1599 in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.John H. Astington, \\"Acting in the Field,\\" Theatre Notebook, 10 October 2006. He played a series of important roles through his career, including: * Beaufort in James Shirley's The Wedding; * King John in Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda; * Vitelli in Philip Massinger's The Renegado; * Mr. Spencer in Thomas Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West; * Scipio in Thomas Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio. Robert Davenport dedicated his poem Too Late to Call Back Yesterday to Bowyer and Richard Robinson. The Queen's Men were disrupted by a long theatre closure due to bubonic plague, which lasted from May 1636 to October 1637. Bowyer, along with three other veterans of that troupe, may have been with James Shirley at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin from 1637 to 1640.Allan H. Stevenson, \\"James Shirley and the Actors at the First Irish Theatre,\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 40 No. 2 (November 1942), pp. 147-60. Bowyer was a member of the King's Men by January 1640. He was one of the six members of that company who were named Grooms of the Chamber on 22 January 1641, indicating that he was a sharer in the troupe by that time. As with many actors, his fortunes passed into eclipse after the London theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. According to a 1655 lawsuit filed by fellow Queen Henrietta's and King's Man Theophilus Bird, Bowyer, along with Thomas Pollard and other members of the King's Men, sold off the company's play scripts and costumes sometime after the theatres closed.Gurr, p. 203. By the time of Bird's suit, Bowyer was a decade dead. Little is known of Bowyer's personal life. He and his wife christened and then buried a son named William in 1621; and they christened and buried another son of the same name the following year, 1622.Emma Marshall Denkinger, \\"Actors' Names in the Registers of St. Bodolph Aldgate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association Vol. 41 No. 1 (March 1926), pp. 91-109; see pp. 98-9.

He is a five time Olympian, triple Olympic medallist, a world champion and a six-time Australian national champion. He represented Australia at the premier world regattas consistently over a twenty year period from 1993 to 2012. Club and state rowing Edwards' senior rowing was done from the Ballarat City Rowing Club where he moved to take up sculling in 1990. He previously rowed at St. Patrick's College, Ballarat, earlier in the same year and stroked the Firsts crew to victory in the Ballarat Head of the Lake Regatta. That victory broke the 22 year drought for the school who had not won the premier event of Head of the Lake Regatta for that long. He joined Wendouree-Ballarat Club Rowing Club in 1999 moving to four-oared crews. Later in his career he relocated to Tasmania in 2006 where he rowed from the New Norfolk Rowing Club in Hobart. Edwards' was first selected to represent Victoria at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships in 1995 when he raced to a second place in the single scull contesting the President's Cup. From 1996 to 2004 and excepting 2001, Edwards represented Victoria in the men's lightweight four contesting the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. His Victorian 1996 lightweight four was victorious. After his relocation to Tasmania he was selected in the Tasmanian lightweight four in 2010. That crew won the Penrith Cup that year. Edwards contested national championship titles at the Australian Rowing Championships on numerous occasions. In 1991, 1992 and 1993 he won the Senior B sculling championship and 1995 and 1997 he won the National Champion Lightweight sculls for Ballarat City Rowing Club .In 2002 he won the national lightweight sculls championship in Wendouree-Ballarat colours. He won the lightweight coxless four title in an Australian selection composite crew in 2007. International representative rowing In 1991 Edwards won his first National Championship in the scull winning Men's Senior B (U23) Sculling championship in Adelaide. In 1992 he teamed with Tim Wise, his Ballarat City teammate to win the Champion Senior Lightweight double sculls. He also won the Men's Lightweight Senior B scull championship. As a result of this performance Edwards earned his first national representative selection was at the 1992 U23 Trans Tasman regatta where he raced a double scull with Jason Tutty winning comfortably all their races in the series. The following year he made his debut Australian senior representative appearance in a lightweight quad scull who finished seventh at the 1993 World Rowing Championships in Racize. At Indianapolis 1994 he again raced in the lightweight quad. That crew made the A final and finished fifth. For the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere, Edwards raced a lightweight double scull with veteran lightweight Bruce Hick to a bronze medal. They stayed together into the 1996 Olympic year, the first time lightweight events were introduced to the Olympic regatta. With their great technical proficiency Hick and Edwards were selected again in the double scull and were expected to medal. They won their heat and placed second in their semi to make the A final. The Swiss brothers Michael and Markus Gier were favourites and Hick & Edwards placed third, winning bronze in the final and beaten out by 0.21 seconds by the Dutch crew for silver. This medal was won when he was competing for Ballarat City Rowing Club and was the first Olympic representation and medal awarded to a Ballarat City member in the club's 125 year history. In 1997 Edwards remained in the Australian lightweight double scull now paired with Queensland's Gary Lynagh. They raced at two Rowing World Cups in Europe before contesting the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France where they finished fifth. In 1998 the Australian selectors switched Edwards to sweep-oared representative crews and he raced at two World Rowing Cups in Europe and at the 1998 World Rowing Championships in the lightweight coxless four. They won the bronze medal at Cologne 1998. He remained in that combination with Darren Balmforth, Bob Richards and stroked by the Tasmanian lightweight champion Simon Burgess into 1999. They finished in fifth place at St Catharines 1999. That same combination made their Olympic preparation through two World Rowing Cups in Europe in 2000 before contesting the 2000 Sydney Olympics with Richards at stroke and Burgess at bow. Edwards held his position in the two seat through their Olympic campaign which showcased two match races between the Australians and the French crew. They met in a semi-final where the Australians pipped the French by 3/100ths of a second. In the final the Australians led for much of the race. The French tried once to break through and failed, then a second time and failed and finally with a matter of metres to go broke through to win by less than half a second. Both races were superb and a highlight of the regatta. Edwards took a break in 2001 but was back in national selection contention in 2002 as a lightweight sculler. He was Australia's lightweight single sculls representative at the World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne and for the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville where he placed fifth. For Milan 2003 he was selected with Queensland's Haimish Karrasch to race the lightweight double scull. They finished in tenth place. For the 2004 Athens Olympics Edwards made his way back into the Australian lightweight coxless four. Both Edwards and Simon Burgess were making their third Olympic appearances and still looking for their first Olympic gold medal. The Danish crew however were favourites and they got away in the 1st 500m. Burgess brought the Australian crew back into contention in the second and third 500 metres. However the Danes still had something in reserve in the rush home extending their lead to 1.4 seconds at the finish. Edwards & Burgess with newcomers Ben Cureton and Glen Loftus won an Olympic silver medal.2004 Olympics Edwards came back into the lightweight coxless four in 2007 with Cureton, Todd Skipworth and Rod Chisholm from New South Wales. They raced at a 2007 World Rowing Cup and then at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich to a seventh placing. Their lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics included a third place at the World Rowing Cup III in Poznan and a seventh place at the WRC I. In Beijing the experienced lightweight foursome didn't figure in the medals in the tough Olympic conditions, they made the B final and finished in ninth place overall. At the 2010 World Rowing Championships in Lake Karapiro, Edwards rowed in the Australian lightweight four with Skipworth, Blair Tunevitsch and Samuel Beltz to a silver medal. It was a thrilling race finish where five crews crossed the line within half a boat length. The Australian four with Edwards at the bow, finished 0.07 secs behind Great Britain and 0.01 secs ahead of China to claim his fourth world championship medal ‚Äì a silver. In 2011 that Australian lightweight four stayed together with Tunevitsch changed out for West Australian Ben Cureton. At the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled they staged a brilliant campaign. Second in their heat, they had to qualify for the final through a repechage and a semi-final. In the final they rowed through the field from a fifth position at the 500m mark, to be 2nd at both the 1000 and 1500 and overtook the Italians in final run to take the gold medal with a 1.2 second margin. Edwards in the bow seat won his first senior world championship title, nineteen years after first representing Australia in green and gold.Edwards at World Rowing Their world champion status qualified the lightweight foursome for the 2012 London Olympics for which they prepared by racing at two World Rowing Cups in Europe. At the 2012 Olympic regatta they placed second in the heat, third in the semi-final and made the Olympic final, finishing in fourth place. Less than one and a quarter seconds separated the first to fourth crews. Cureton, Skipworth and Edwards all retired at that point. For Edwards it was the end of a twenty year stellar representative career. Post-rowing Edwards works as the State Development Officer for Rowing Tasmania, and has extensive involvement in the selection of Tasmanian state crews. In 2010 he was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame.

Career=College Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Noble attended the University of Wisconsin, but he spent most of his college career with the University of Nebraska. Playing for the Cornhuskers from 1921‚Äì1923, he helped the team win three consecutive Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) championships. Two of Noble's most notable college performances came in 1923. On October 13, the Cornhuskers opened Memorial Stadium with a game against the University of Oklahoma Sooners. In the second half, Noble scored the first touchdown in the new stadium, the first of two touchdowns by him in a 24‚Äì0 Nebraska win. Later in the season, Noble scored two touchdowns in a 14‚Äì7 Cornhuskers victory over Knute Rockne's University of Notre Dame team; it was the Fighting Irish's only loss of the 1923 season. Noble was named to the 1923 All-MVC team. He was also a member of Nebraska's track team, running in sprints. Professional After turning pro, Noble signed with the NFL's Cleveland Bulldogs for 1924. On October 12, he scored his first NFL touchdown in a Bulldogs win against the Akron Pros. Playing in all nine of the team's games, and starting in eight, he totalled four rushing and two receiving touchdowns, helping the 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 Bulldogs win the NFL championship.

The following year, Noble stayed in Cleveland but changed teams, playing for the Cleveland Panthers of the new AFL. In five games, Noble helped the Panthers finish with a final record of 3‚Äì2 and was tied for second in the league in rushing touchdowns with four, despite his team's limited schedule. He also caught one touchdown pass. It would prove to be Noble's final professional season. Post-retirement Following his playing career, Noble became an official and worked for the Big Ten Conference. In later years, he became an executive for an insurance company. In 1972, Noble was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame. He suffered a stroke on January 24, 1983, and died at the age of 82.

Okakarara consists of the residential areas of Pamue, the former whites-only area, and Okakarara Proper, the former black residential area. It is the district capital of the Okakarara electoral constituency that includes surrounding settlements.  History  The first house was built by Salathiel Kambamba Kambazembi and Reinard Tjerije who arrived in the area in 1923. The settlement grew over time and was proclaimed a town in 1992. Okakarara became the centre of the Herero Tribal Authority in the early 1970s. Politics Okakarara is governed by a town council that has seven seats. Formerly part of the Apartheid-era bantustan Hereroland, the area is still mainly populated by the Herero people. Because of this, Okakarara is one of the few towns in Namibia where the otherwise dominant SWAPO party faces considerable opposition. In the 2004 elections, SWAPO came only second, and the Herero- dominated National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) won. Due to a very unusual coalition between SWAPO and Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), the then elected town mayor Ehrnst Katjiku has SWAPO affiliation. The 2015 local authority election was again won by NUDO which gained three seats and 842 votes. SWAPO came second with 538 votes and gained two seats, and the DTA also gained two seats with 483 votes. From the year 2010 to 2012 the Mayor of Okakarara was Hon. MZ Tjiho from DTA and than taken over as from 2013 to 2015 by Hon. John Viakondo, from 2016 to 2018 the Okakarara was governed by PDM Mayor Hon. Olga Tjiurutue, currently the town is back to the ruling party mayor Hon. Veundjua Kamutuezu till 2020 when the next election take place.  Economy  Since 2007, Okakarara has hosted an annual trade fair. This initiative also led to the erection of a trade centre and an SME park. The town further features a secondary school, a government hospital, a vocational training centre, and an abattoir.  Okakarara Trade Fair The Okakarara trade fair is an annual four-day trade fair event which was first started in 2007 as a way to bring the breeders of the communal area around the town together to showcase the animals as well as share ideas on how they can help improve farming methods. Marquees are erected at the Okakarara Community Cultural Centre which was built with funding from Germany, to accommodate the increased number of exhibitors, as the existing hall is too small to cater to all the exhibitors. Exhibitors include automobile dealers who showcase their latest models. Farmers showcasing their livestock, food stalls, beverages and many other stalls are available. Other exhibitors engaged in the selling of agricultural equipment and vehicles are placed around the fairground on open stands. Because Okakarara is in a rural area, agriculture is important and so the trade fair is a great opportunity to attract investment to the town and it also allows communal farmers to showcase their breeds.  Twin towns  Okakarara has twinning agreements with the following Namibian towns: * Grootfontein * Ongwediva * Otjiwarongo * Outapi * Outjo * Rehoboth * Tsumeb * Windhoek Notable residents * Zedekia Ngavirue, diplomat * Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, former Namibian Minister of Justice * M.Z.

After First World War service, he returned to the Kent ground staff, although he made no appearances for either the first or second teams, and left in 1922 to join Chard Cricket Club in Somerset as the club professional. Performances at Chard as a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler attracted the attention of Somerset, which offered him a one-year professional contract in 1924, during which he made his solitary first-class cricket appearance.

The saga is a tale that begins with the origins of man, by way of descension upon the primitive Setian race, all the way to its downfall as paved by the Setians' act of vengeance. It discusses humanity's evil intentions that begin to backfire in their last days, with the Setian messiah Set Abominae serving as the catalyst to its self-destruction. Events parallel to those in the Bible (similarly the Tower of Babel), and elsewhere throughout history, occurred in order to further bring about humanity's downfall. Overview The saga was first revealed in the final three tracks of Iced Earth's fifth studio album, 1998's Something Wicked This Way Comes, known as the Something Wicked trilogy. These three songs, \\"Prophecy,\\" \\"Birth of the Wicked,\\" and the \\"Coming Curse,\\" served as the backbone to the Jon Schaffer's Something Wicked story, as well as concert staples. In December 2006, Jon Schaffer posted a journal announcing that Iced Earth's new album, then titled Something Wicked - Part 1, would be released in September/October 2007. The follow-up album, then titled Something Wicked - Part 2, would be released in January/February 2008, with both albums serving to further explain the story within the Something Wicked Trilogy. He later announced the final track list, and that the album would be renamed to Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1, with a new target release of August or September. On June 25, Schaffer uploaded the cover of the album on icedearth.com. Audio samples of all the tracks have been posted at spv.de, the official site of the band's record label. In addition to providing prospective album titles and track titles, he updates the band's mixing status on a new single entitled the Overture of the Wicked EP, which was then released in June 2007. The EP, which featured vocalist Matt Barlow's then-replacement Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, contained the single to the upcoming song entitled \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\", as well as a re-recording of the Something Wicked trilogy that showcased the band's more modern sound which was something to be expected for the upcoming release. Framing Armageddon, released September 11, 2007, is the band's first studio album featuring lead guitarist Troy Seele, and drummer Brent Smedley, who never played on an Iced Earth studio album during his previous stints with the group. Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens makes his final appearance as lead singer on this record, as well. Also, this was bassist Dennis Hayes' first appearance on an Iced Earth album, though he only appears on two songs. Former Iced Earth lead guitarist Tim Mills is featured on \\"Reflections\\", and co-wrote both that song and \\"Infiltrate and Assimilate\\" (as well as \\"I Walk Alone\\" on the next album). A music video for \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" has been released, though lead guitarist Troy Seele was not yet with the band when it was filmed. The video features special effects to make the live action video resemble animation. Following the release and tour in support of Something Wicked Part 1, Jon Schaffer announced that former vocalist Matt Barlow would return to the band, causing Ripper to front for Yngwie Malmsteen. Due to his long-awaited return, the release date for Part 2 was to be held back to around the same time that Part 1 was released in Autumn 2008. In June 2008, the single I Walk Among You was released, which featured a track from the upcoming song \\"I Walk Alone,\\" including various re-recordings of tracks from Something Wicked Part 1. Also during June 2008, the final track list was revealed, and that the album title would be changed from Revelation Abomination to The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2, with a new target release of September 2008. The Crucible Of Man was released on September 9, 2008 in the United States. This is the second and last Iced Earth album to feature Dennis Hayes on bass. Dennis plays on five songs, despite having been fired along with Tim Owens in late 2007. Iced Earth's current bassist Freddie Vidales appears in the booklet for the album, however he does not play on the disc (all remaining bass parts on both albums are played by Jon Schaffer). This is the first time since Matt Barlow's initial departure that showcases a writing collaboration with Barlow and Schaffer, with \\"Minions of the Watch,\\" \\"Crucify the King,\\" \\"Sacrificial Kingdoms,\\" and \\"Something Wicked (Part 3), written solely by Barlow. Immediately following its release, it was revealed that Jon Schaffer intends to release both of the Something Wicked albums in one boxed set, with Matt Barlow contributing the vocals on both albums for the sake of continuity. He intends to add at least four songs to The Crucible of Man, including various segues between songs, and remix Framing Armageddon. Schaffer believes this boxed set will be available around Christmas 2008 or later in 2009. This release never ended up happening, but a boxset entitled \\"Box of the Wicked\\" was released containing Framing Armageddon, The Crucible of Man, Overture of the Wicked, I Walk Among You, and a bonus disc featuring a re- recording of A Charge to Keep with Matt Barlow on vocals and three live tracks. To date, seven releases have featured the story circulating Set Abominae: * Something Wicked This Way Comes, the \\"Something Wicked\\" song cycle * Overture of the Wicked EP * Framing Armageddon (Something Wicked Part 1) * I Walk Among You * The Crucible of Man (Something Wicked Part 2) * Dystopia, the tracks \\"Dystopia\\" and \\"Tragedy and Triumph\\" * The Plaques of Babylon, the tracks \\"Plagues of Babylon\\", \\"Democide\\", \\"The Culling\\", \\"Among the Living Dead\\", \\"Resistance\\" and \\"The End\\"? In an interview on The Aebyss, Schaffer was asked if \\"Tragedy and Triumph\\" will be the end of the Something Wicked Saga, to which he replied: He also appears in the artwork of several other Iced Earth albums. Schaffer also plans to write a graphic novel based on the adventures of the all-powerful Set Abominae.  Story =Part one Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1 tells the story of the Setians, who were the original inhabitants of Earth, and are directly descended from the \\"Great Architect\\". They are said to have nearly omniscient knowledge. Humans, who originate on a distant planet and have developed space travel, invade Earth in a bid for \\"unlimited power and unlimited knowledge\\", killing all but ten thousand Setians. The remaining ten thousand go into hiding in the mountains in the east. The Setian High Council, which consists of the twelve Elders and the High Priest, make a plan to get revenge on the invading human race. They plan to initiate \\"The Clouding\\", which involves brainwashing all the humans and making them forget their origins. Once completed, the Setians will assimilate into the human race and manipulate history, as deemed by the Domino Decree, by creating religions such as Christianity and Islam to divide the humans. Division would then cause man to succumb to worldly intentions and in doing so, bring about conflicts that would only make them weaker. Once human kind is sufficiently divided after ten thousand years, the Setians will await, as the prophecy told millennia ago, the birth of the Antichrist, Set Abominae. It was predicted that Set Abominae would destroy all of the human race and execute the revenge the Setians have long awaited. Events parallel those in the Bible (particularly the story of the Tower of Babel). Framing Armageddon tells the story from the prophecy to the events right before the birth of Set Abominae. Part two The album tells the story of the Antichrist, Set Abominae, starting with his birth: on the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month (666). He grows up within the Setian community, known as the Minions of the Watch, who would raise the boy and put him on the path to his destiny. It was with this \\"undying love\\" that taught Set about the death of his ancestors and how he is their savior from the invading Humans. While learning the arts of the ancients such as time manipulation and shape shifting, he goes through many trials and tribulations and encounters self- doubt about who he is and whether or not he can actually fulfill the Setian prophecy. In the end, he pulls through and emerges complete and confident about his purpose. Upon passing through the Dimension Gauntlet as his final test, he is crowned as the Astral Beast, whose wrath would be the catalyst to Setian salvation. Set starts his work with the assassination of Jesus Christ, punishing him for the gift of second sight, and moves on to other great leaders and foreseers throughout history. Over the course of the next two thousand years he crushes kingdoms under their own greed, deceit, and thirst for conquest, controls the weak with divisive tools such as religion, and declares his own godhood by appealing to the lies and self-deceit in every human being. The album ends on an open-ended note, with the song Come What May. As Set observes humanity through the ages, he acknowledges humans as a race with much potential despite its flawed nature. Set makes a requisition for humanity to overcome its imperfections to be thus saved from their destructive fate.

In 1913-1915 he attended the Psychoneurological Institute in Saint Petersburg. In 1915 he transferred to the University of Tomsk in Siberia to complete his law degree. In St. Petersburg he established a Zionist student organization called The Friend and was the editor of a magazine distributed to Jewish students throughout Russia. Then, while living in Siberia, the Russian Revolution broke out, and Alexander was involved in Zionist activities and support for Jewish political prisoners sent to Siberia. The Bolshevik revolution and the oppression of Jews led Yevzerov to escaped from Siberia. He journeyed by trains, horses and seventeen days on a camel back through the Gobi Desert to reach Harbin, China in October, 1920, and then to Shanghai. He found a thriving community of Jewish refugees in China. Together with another Zionist activist, Moishe Novomeiski (Chairman of the National Counsel of the Far East Jews), Alexander Yevzerov establish the weekly periodical Siberia-Palestine that later was renamed Jewish Life; the publication continued until 1943 under the editorship of Dr. Abraham Kaufman. Alexander was also active in the \\"underground rail-road\\" to help Russian refugees in China get certificates to allow them to immigrate to the Land of Israel (which was under the British mandate at the time). On June 12, 1921, together with 44 other members of the Siberian Zionist Organization, Alexander boarded the Lloyd Triestino Nippon cargo ship. After 40 days at sea they arrived at Port Said, Egypt and then took another ship to Jaffa, Palestine. In Jaffa Alexander joined the \\"Siberian Group\\" of new immigrants that set to pave the new road between Haifa and Geda and then built British constructions in Jenin. Laborers at that group remember Alexander as the crazy guy who after a long working day would march around the encampment reciting Russian poetry while others were entirely worn out trying to rest. When Alexander fell ill with Malaria, he was sent to the hospital in Tel Aviv and fell in love with the nurse, which later became his wife, Rebecca Volkenstein (b. Chita, Siberia, 1897‚Äì1981). Rebecca herself was active in establishing the Hadassah Nursing School in Tel Aviv; she was the head nurse in that school and after moving to Jerusalem continued to work in Hadassah Medical Center and in other care centers until her 80s. Alexander and Rebecca had two children, Manuela Fuller and Gabriel (Gabbi) Ezer, 6 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. In 1973, Alexander died after a long battle with cancer. Alexander and Rebecca are buried in Israel's Har HaMenuchot Cemetery in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem. Promoting Industry Alexander developed a vision of making Israel an industrial powerhouse. He began to organize local industrial exhibitions in 1923 and 1924, which later were expanded into an international Fairs, the 1928 and 1934 \\"Levant Fairs\\" (or Orient Fair). The symbol of the fairs was the flying camel, envisioned by Ezer and designed by the architect Arie Elchanani. These fairs grew rapidly: in the Levant Fair of 1934, 820 international companies were represented and 600,000 people from around the world came to see the public exhibitions. At the time, Tel Aviv was only populated by about 35,000 people. To accommodate the fair, Alexander and Meir Dizengoff (the first mayor of Tel Aviv) established the company \\"Mischar Ve Taasia\\" (Trade and Industry Publishing and Exhibition Co.), which purchased land north of Tel Aviv to develop the fair grounds. They also published a bi- weekly magazine, \\"Mischar Ve Taasia\\", starting in 1925, with Ezer serving as its editor. In 1927, Ezer published \\"Palestine from the Air\\", one of the first aerial photography ever taken in this region. Unfortunately, an Arab upheaval erupted in 1939, which made Tel Aviv a dangerous place for an international fair to be held. As a result, the Levant Fairs had to be canceled and instead Alexander organized the Middle-East pavilion of the 1939 World Fair held in New York City. Origin of the Name Ezer After Israel fought and won its War of Independence, Alexander Yevserov and his good friend Moshe Shertok wanted new names to go along with their new state. They decided to make their new names synonyms of each other. Shertok changed his name to Sharett, which means \\"to serve\\" in Hebrew. Yevserov changed his name to Ezer, which means \\"to help\\" in Hebrew. Moshe Sharett eventually became the first Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and the second Prime Minister of Israel after the first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion resigned. Other work Ezer's next vision was to make Jerusalem, the new capital, a center for commerce, industry and culture for Israel and the world's Jews. In 1950, he built the National Conference Center of Jerusalem (Binyanei HaUmah in Hebrew). Among the famous events held at the center were the Zionist Congress, a 1953's exhibition of Israel's achievements \\"blooming desert\\" and the 1958 exhibition for the 10th anniversary of Israel. Ezer helped in the publication of the first Israeli Encyclopedia, and he founded the International Club of Hebrew Literature. He thought that the best way to help the economy of the young state was to establish a strong tourism industry. He founded the Ministry of Tourism and became the first government adviser of tourism. Additionally, he authored books and newspaper articles about the history of the Zionist movement, politics, art, culture and more. He started a radio broadcast for Soviet Jews who under the communist regime were not allowed any communications with the outside world. His radio provided the Soviet Jews with information about Israel in an attempt to contradict Soviet propaganda. His radio pseudonym was Asaf-Tal-Or, a combination of the names of his three Israeli grandsons. Awards and recognition He was listed as one of the 2,000 most influential men in the world and appears in Who's Who of World Jewry. The mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek gave him the honorary Medallion of the city.

Fungus- growing termites species cultivate a fungal genus within Termitomyces for decomposing dead plant material externally within the colony(Note: All termite species decompose organic matter internally with the help of their gut microbiota rather than Macrotermitinae subfamily). Approximately 30 million years ago this subfamily starts to cultivate ancestor of Termitomyces. The real force or reasons to start the fungal domestication is not yet clear. Some gut microbiota based studies indicated that Macrotermitinae subfamily gut composition have close relationship with a cockroach species, both have similar gut microbial composition. This gut microbiota based evidence strongly supported by amber sample which found out an ancestor species of both termites and cockroach. An ant family also cultivate fungus in their colony, known as fungus-growing ants, these ants also shows a similar life style symbiotic life style of fungus-growing termites. Researcher believes that Macrotermitinae is last formed termite groups because of their complex colony life style. For example, over-lapping caste system, age-depended polytheism. Moreover, this subfamily gut composed with bacterial community, rather than flagellates. These fungus growers might be encoded with natural antibiotics because colony does not shows infections so far. There are 14 genera which extended to 350 plus species so far in the subfamily. Colony structure Macrotermitinae has a complex colony system. A mature Macrotermitinae colony consists of a royal pair, sterile caste, winged reproductive called \\"alates\\" and young ones. A royal pair are a king and queen which only can reproduce young ones. Sterile caste are workers (major workers and minor workers) and soldiers (major soldiers and minor soldiers). The royal pair produces workers, soldiers, alates (future royal pairs). The royal pair lives in the \\"royal chamber\\", the queen continuous lay eggs and king will mate with her. Young ones are immature workers, soldier and alates, they live in the royal chamber after they hatched. Workers concentrates on colony process, for example collecting dead plant materiel, making fungal comb, brood care, taking care of young ones etc. Soldiers protect the colony. Distribution The Macrotermitinae subfamily has a widespread distribution through the tropics of Africa, the Middle East, and southern and southeastern Asia, but it is not present in Australia or the New World. Fossil evidence from Tanzania show that the Macrotermitinae developed agriculture about 31 million years ago. Ecology Like other termites, Macrotermitinae are soil engineers, mixing their salivary secretions with soil particles to make their strong, hard mounds and galleries. Their mounds are some of the largest built by any species of termite, with volumes of thousands of litres and lasting for many decades. They are probably the most complex mound colonies of any insect group. There are 11 accepted genera in the Macrotermitinae and about 330 species, with the greatest diversity being in Africa. About 40 species of Termitomyces have been identified as symbionts. In contrast to the fungus-growing ants in the tribe Attini, the Termitomyces often bear fruiting bodies which produce spores, and it is believed that transmission of the fungus to other termites is mainly by horizontal transmission (sibling to sibling) rather than by vertical transmission (mother to daughter). Some species are an exception to this, and in all five species of the genus Microtermes tested, the symbiont fungi did not bear sexual fruiting bodies, and transmission was through the maternal route. Another exception was the single species Macrotermes bellicosus where again the fungus did not fruit, and where transmission was paternal. They have a rather rigid caste system, with little flexibility after the early instar stage. They also exhibit complex behavioural activities and their presence in an arid or semi-arid area can be dominant over other termite species. As compared to other higher termites however, they show some primitive features and have failed to evolve soil consumption. The mound contains galleries and chambers in which the termites grow fungi as endosymbionts. The fungi concerned are species of Termitomyces; it is unclear whether one species of termite is always associated with one species of fungus, and it is probable that several species of termite may utilise a single fungal species. The worker termites bring plant material such as dried grass, decaying wood and leaf litter, back to the mound. This material is chewed up and semi-digested by the termites, fertilised with their faeces and placed in the chambers where it is quickly colonised by the fungus to form a \\"fungus comb\\". The termites cultivate these fungus gardens, adding more substrate as required, and removing the older parts of the comb for consumption by all members of the colony. In addition, some species feed on various types of living and dead plant material including wood, but not on decomposing vegetation; these termites have a similar microbial gut flora to other species of termite.

When the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway (which eventually became part of the Northern Alberta Railway and later the Athabasca Northern Railway) reached Conklin in 1921, the town was relocated alongside the railway tracks. Conklin was an important centre for the local fur trade from 1940 to 1960. Mink pelts from several mink farms in the area were transferred by canoe and dogsled to the railway siding at Conklin for shipment to markets. From 1940 to 1960 there was heavy commercial fishing in Christina Lake, and a fish processing plant was located at the outlet to the Jackfish River. Conklin lies within the Athabasca Oil Sands region, and Cenovus Energy has been operating its Christina Lake project in the area since 2000.

Symptoms include a small head and a specific facial appearance, severe intellectual disability, developmental disability, limited to no functional speech, balance and movement problems, seizures, and sleep problems. Children usually have a happy personality and have a particular interest in water. The symptoms generally become noticeable by one year of age. Angelman syndrome is due to a lack of function of part of chromosome 15 inherited from a person's mother. Most of the time, it is due to a deletion or mutation of the UBE3A gene on that chromosome. Occasionally, it is due to inheriting two copies of chromosome 15 from a person's father and none from their mother. As the father's versions are inactivated by a process known as genomic imprinting, no functional version of the gene remains. Angelman syndrome is typically due to a new mutation rather than one inherited from a person's parents. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and possibly genetic testing. No cure is available. Treatment is generally supportive in nature. Anti-seizure medications are used in those with seizures. Physical therapy and bracing may help with walking. Those affected have a nearly normal life expectancy. AS affects 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Males and females are affected with equal frequency. It is named after British pediatrician Harry Angelman, who first described the syndrome in 1965. An older term, \\"happy puppet syndrome\\", is generally considered pejorative. Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome is a separate condition, caused by a similar loss of the father's chromosome 15. Signs and symptoms The following text lists signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome and their relative frequency in affected individuals.Facts about Angelman syndrome (PDF) . Anonymous. Angelman syndrome Foundation (US) website. Retrieved September 29, 2012. Consistent (100%) *Developmental delay, functionally severe *Speech impairment, no or minimal use of words; receptive and non-verbal communication skills higher than verbal ones *Movement or balance disorder, usually ataxia of gait and/or tremulous movement of limbs *Behavioral characteristics of the following types: any combination of atypical frequent laughter/smiling; atypically happy demeanor; easily excitable personality, often with hand flapping movements; hypermotoric behavior; short attention span Frequent (more than 80%) *Delayed, disproportionate growth in head circumference, usually resulting in microcephaly (absolute or relative) by age 2 *Seizures, onset usually less than 3 years of age *Abnormal EEG, characteristic pattern with large amplitude slow-spike waves Associated (20‚Äì80%)=Cause and pathophysiology Chromosome 15 Angelman syndrome is caused by the lack of expression of a gene known as UBE3A in developing. This gene is located within a region of chromosome 15 known as 15q11-q13 and is part of the ubiquitin pathway. In fact, UBE3A codes for a very selective E6-AP ubiquitin ligase for which MAPK1, PRMT5, CDK1, CDK4, Œ≤-catenin, and UBXD8 have been identified as ubiquitination targets Typically, a fetus inherits a maternal copy of UBE3A and a paternal copy of UBE3A. In certain areas of developing brain, the paternal copy of UBE3A is inactivated through a process known as imprinting and the fetus relies on the functioning maternal copy of UBE3A in order to develop normally. In an individual with AS, however, the maternal UBE3A gene is absent or not functioning normally. This can be due to genetic errors such as the deletion or mutation of a segment of chromosome 15, uniparental disomy, or translocation. While Angelman syndrome can be caused by a single mutation in the UBE3A gene, the most common genetic defect leading to Angelman syndrome is a ~4Mb (megabase) maternal deletion in chromosomal region 15q11-13. Specifically, the paternal copy of UBE3A is known to be imprinted within the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Therefore, in these areas of the brain, a functioning maternal copy of UBE3A is essential for proper development. Region 15q11-13 is implicated in both Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). While AS results from the loss of the UBE3A gene within this region on the paternal chromosome, loss of a different cluster of genes within the same region on the maternal chromosome causes PWS. The methylation test that is performed for Angelman syndrome looks for methylation on the gene's neighbor SNRPN, which is silenced by methylation on the maternal copy of the gene. Neurophysiology The electroencephalogram (EEG) in AS is usually abnormal, more so than clinically expected.Williams C (2005) \\"Neurological aspects of the Angelman syndrome\\" Brain & Development 27: 88‚Äì94 This EEG facilitates the differential diagnosis of AS, but is not pathognomonic. Three distinct interictal patterns are seen in these patients.Dan, B., Angelman syndrome: Current understanding and research prospects. Epilepsia, 2009. 50(11): p. 2331‚Äì2339. The most common pattern is a very large amplitude 2‚Äì3 Hz rhythm most prominent in prefrontal leads. Next most common is a symmetrical 4‚Äì6 Hz high voltage rhythm. The third pattern, 3‚Äì6 Hz activity punctuated by spikes and sharp waves in occipital leads, is associated with eye closure. Paroxysms of laughter have no relation to the EEG, ruling out this feature as a gelastic phenomenon. EEG anomalies may be used as a quantitative biomarkers to \\"chart progression of AS and as clinical outcome measures\\". Slow delta activity (~3 Hz) is greatly increased in AS relative to typically developing children, yet more pronounced in children with partial 15q deletions as opposed to those with etiologies principally affecting UBE3A.Frohlich, Joel, Meghan Miller, Lynne M. Bird, Pilar Garces, Hannah Purtell, Marius C. Hoener, Benjamin D. Philpot et al. \\"Electrophysiological phenotype in Angelman syndrome differs between genotypes.\\" Biological Psychiatry (2019). Theta activity (~5 Hz) is much greater in children with partial 15q deletions. Thus, delta activity appears to be chiefly reflective of UBE3A dysfunction with some modulation from other 15q genes, whereas theta activity may be an electrophysiological readout of genes beyond UBE3A such as GABRA5, GABRB3, and GABRG3. Future clinical trials in AS might exploit the foregoing by using EEG as a readout of drug target engagement. It appears that the neurons of people with Angelman syndrome are formed correctly, but they cannot function properly. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome is based on: *A history of delayed motor milestones and then later a delay in general development, especially of speech *Unusual movements including fine tremors, jerky limb movements, hand flapping and a wide-based, stiff-legged gait. *Characteristic facial appearance (but not in all cases). *A history of epilepsy and an abnormal EEG tracing. *A happy disposition with frequent laughter *A deletion or inactivity on chromosome 15 by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or by BACs-on- Beads technology. Diagnostic criteria for the disorder were initially established in 1995 in collaboration with the Angelman syndrome Foundation (US); these criteria underwent revision in 2005. Seizures are a consequence, but so is excessive laughter, which is a major hindrance to early diagnosis. Differential diagnosis Other conditions that can appear similar include: *Autism spectrum *Cerebral palsy *Rett syndrome *Mowat-Wilson syndrome *Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency *Pitt-Hopkins syndrome *Phelan-McDermid syndrome *Prader-Willi syndrome Treatment Melatonin There is currently no cure available. The epilepsy can be controlled by the use of one or more types of anticonvulsant medications. However, there are difficulties in ascertaining the levels and types of anticonvulsant medications needed to establish control, because people with AS often have multiple types of seizures. Many families use melatonin to promote sleep in a condition which often affects sleep patterns. Many individuals with Angelman syndrome sleep for a maximum of five hours at any one time. Mild laxatives are also used frequently to encourage regular bowel movements. Early intervention with physiotherapy is sometimes used to encourage joint mobility and prevent stiffening of the joints. Speech and Language Therapy is commonly employed to assist individuals with Angelman syndrome and their communication issues. Those with the syndrome are generally happy and contented people who like human contact and play. People with AS exhibit a profound desire for personal interaction with others. Communication can be difficult at first, but as a child with AS develops, there is a definite character and ability to make themselves understood. People with AS tend to develop strong non-verbal skills to compensate for their limited use of speech. It is widely accepted that their understanding of communication directed to them is much larger than their ability to return conversation. Most affected people will not develop more than 5‚Äì10 words, if any at all. Prognosis The severity of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome varies significantly across the population of those affected. Some speech and a greater degree of self-care are possible among the least profoundly affected. Walking and the use of simple sign language may be beyond the reach of the more profoundly affected. Early and continued participation in physical, occupational (related to the development of fine- motor control skills), and communication (speech) therapies are believed to significantly improve the prognosis (in the areas of cognition and communication) of individuals affected by AS. Further, the specific genetic mechanism underlying the condition is thought to correlate to the general prognosis of the affected person. On one end of the spectrum, a mutation to the UBE3A gene is thought to correlate to the least affected, whereas larger deletions on chromosome 15 are thought to correspond to the most affected. The clinical features of Angelman syndrome alter with age. As adulthood approaches, hyperactivity and poor sleep patterns improve. The seizures decrease in frequency and often cease altogether and the EEG abnormalities are less obvious. Medication is typically advisable to those with seizure disorders. Often overlooked is the contribution of the poor sleep patterns to the frequency and/or severity of the seizures. Medication may be worthwhile to help deal with this issue and improve the prognosis with respect to seizures and sleep. Also noteworthy are the reports that the frequency and severity of seizures temporarily escalate in pubescent Angelman syndrome girls, but do not seem to affect long-term health.The facial features remain recognizable with age, but many adults with AS look remarkably youthful for their age. Puberty and menstruation begin at around the average age. Sexual development is thought to be unaffected, as evidenced by a single reported case of a woman with Angelman syndrome conceiving a female child who also had Angelman syndrome. The majority of those with AS achieve continence by day and some by night. Angelman syndrome is not a degenerative syndrome, and thus people with AS may improve their living skills with support. Dressing skills are variable and usually limited to items of clothing without buttons or zippers. Most adults can eat with a knife or spoon and fork, and can learn to perform simple household tasks. General health is fairly good and life-span near average. Particular problems which have arisen in adults are a tendency to obesity (more in females), and worsening of scoliosis if it is present. The affectionate nature which is also a positive aspect in the younger children may also persist into adult life where it can pose a problem socially, but this problem is not insurmountable. Epidemiology Though the prevalence of Angelman syndrome is not precisely known, there are some estimates. The best data available are from studies of school age children, ages 6‚Äì13 years, living in Sweden and from Denmark where the diagnosis of AS children in medical clinics was compared to an 8-year period of about 45,000 births. The Swedish study showed an AS prevalence of about 1/20,000 and the Danish study showed a minimum AS prevalence of about 1/10,000. History \\"Boy with a Puppet\\" or \\"A child with a drawing\\" by Giovanni Francesco Caroto. Harry Angelman, a pediatrician working in Warrington, England, first reported three children with this condition in 1965. Angelman later described his choice of the title \\"Puppet Children\\" to describe these cases as being related to an oil painting he had seen while vacationing in Italy: Case reports from the United States first began appearing in the medical literature in the early 1980s. In 1987, it was first noted that around half of the children with AS have a small piece of chromosome 15 missing (chromosome 15q partial deletion). Society and culture Many poems in Richard Price's poetry collections Hand Held (1997), Lucky Day (2005), and Small World (2012) reflect on the disability of the poet's daughter, who has Angelman syndrome. In the 2011 Philippine drama series Budoy, the titular character and main protagonist Budoy Maniego (played by Filipino actor Gerald Anderson) is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome. Research Topoisomerase inhibitors are under research as of 2017.

Katja begged him to stay and after his company, what he worked for in his old hometown Flensburg, he agreed to stay and begin a new life. Arno tells them that they can stay as long as they want. The family soon later is joined by Matthias and Katja's youngest son Fabian. When Matthias loses his job in Flensburg, Arno wants to help his cousin and gives him work at his own construction company 'Brandner Bau'. But then it comes to first tensions between Arno and Matthias when he helps Arno's daughter Susanne to get enough money from his ex-wife Elisabeth to save the company. Arno doesn't want the help of his ex-wife and loses almost his company to Adrian Degenhardt out of pride. But then it is one of Arno's worst enemies, Sebastian von Lahnstein, who is also Lydia's new boyfriend helps him get his company back and fixes also the money problem Arno was in. The betrayal Matthias is impressed with Sebastian and thinks that he is the right guy for his daughter. But the young couple has many problems to solve. Matthias' own marriage falls apart when his wife Katja confesses to him that she slept with another man and eventually that she is pregnant. Matthias has problems to deal with all that, but tries to rescue his marriage over and over again. Then he is even willing to accept Katja's unborn child, in case it isn't his. Matthias gets credit from his family for working things with Katja out, when he has the suspicion that the man Katja might have slept with is Lydia's boyfriend Sebastian. But his son Fabian tells him, that this would be insane and that Katja would never do this to Lydia. Matthias thinks Fabian is right and is on a business trip for the next few days. When he comes back, he soon learns that his instinct was right. Katja slept with Sebastian and destroyed with that one-night stand the whole family. Matthias is angry and can't believe that Katja would betray him and Lydia like that. He throws her out of the house with the announcement that he wants a divorce. When David, Matthias' other son, returns from Australia he tries to talk to his parents and get them back together, but their decision seems final. But in the end, Matthias can't stay away from her and sees that Katja is his great love and he never will get over her. He takes her back and wants to give her another chance, which Lydia doesn't understand and fears to lose her father. But with time, Lydia begins to miss Katja too. Matthias hopes that he sooner or later can reunite his family. When Lydia helps Katja to give birth to her daughter Christina, the two finally reconcile. Matthias first doesn't know how to deal with Christina, still not knowing if she really is his daughter, but after a moment of soul searching he accepts Christina as his daughter. Together with David, Lydia and Christina, Matthias and Katja celebrate Christmas, before Katja starts to feel sick. Matthias is worried and wants her to see a doctor, but she won't listen. Short time later, Lydia promises her mother to take care of the family, before Katja dies in Matthias' arms. The new love He tries to move on and finds a good new friend in Nathalie K√§ppler. While she becomes a friend of the family, Nathalie starts to realize that she develops strong feelings for Matthias. He surprises Nathalie to spend the day with him and Christina at a baby swimming class. A day that ends with the two sharing a kiss. They eventually become a couple, but have to deal with the jealousy of Nathalie's former husband Ansgar von Lahnstein. He tries to ruin the construction company Brandner Bau in order to get Nathalie back. When she tries to stop him and gets into one of his schemes, Ansgar makes it seem like Nathalie cheated on Matthias with him. But it doesn't take Matthias long to see that Ansgar only tries to separate them and do whatever it takes to be successful. Ansgar almost can ruin the company though, but thanks to a new project, Arno and Matthias can rescue Brandner Bau. Nathalie and Matthias look into their bright future with now expecting their first child together. Fighting for Christina Sebastian and Matthias both try to avoid to subject of Christina's paternity, but when she has an accident on Sebastian's wedding with Lydia and needs a blood donation, Matthias finds out that he isn't a match and not Christina's father. Lydia and Sebastian are shocked and Lydia can't believe that her father and husband lied to her before, by telling her that they already had a paternity test with Matthias as biological father. Sebastian tries to handle to situation in staying away from his daughter in order to save his marriage. But with time and his involvement in the Brandner family, Sebastian comes close to Christina and can't hide his fatherly feelings for long. When Matthias realizes that Sebastian wants to be a part of his daughter's life, he is alarmed and fears to lose her to the man who once slept with his deceased wife. The two get into fights over and over again and Sebastian even plans to get custody, when he needs to realize that because of Katja and Matthias' marriage he has no legal claim on Christina.

The ship is used specifically to transport people and freight to Malibu.  History  During those early years, Young Life was reliant on charter freight boats to transport their young passengers from Vancouver to Malibu. By 1965, Young Life was faced with a challenge when their stable chartered freight hauler would no longer be in business.Hitz, Charles W.(2003). Through the Rapids - The History of Princess Louisa Inlet, p.160-161. Sitka 2 Publishing ., Kirkland, WA. . A suitable vessel would need to be designed and built per Young Life's needs and a letter of intent was issued. Once approved, Philip F. Spaulding and Associates of Seattle was selected to design the vessel and the False Creek shipyard selected was Allied Shipbuilders Ltd. who would build the ship. The name of the ship would be called the Malibu Princess after a large yacht Young Life sold to help finance it which would be renamed the Weatherly. *The design of the Malibu Princess was a shorter version of the MV Coho of the Black Ball Line. The overall cost of the ship was $335,000 with $135,000 coming from the Canadian Maritime Commission Ship Subsidy and from the proceeds from the sale of the soon-to-be Weatherly. The remaining funds were through a loan that Mr. C.D. Weyerhaeuser was able to secure. Eventually, the boat was paid off through fund raising and major donations.Hitz, Charles W.(2003). Through the Rapids - The History of Princess Louisa Inlet, p.160-161. Sitka 2 Publishing ., Kirkland, WA. . *The ship was launched on March 26, 1966 on Saturday morning at nine in the morning. When she was launched, the Malibu Princess was based out of, the North Vancouver waterfront, around the site of the current SeaBus Terminal, at the foot of Chesterfield Ave., then from 1972, she used a pier, just West from the old Pier B-C, which is now the location of Canada Place and the thriving cruise ship facility of Vancouver. The Princess would make its 16+ hour round trip from Vancouver to Malibu, taking campers and supplies to The Bu then returning with finished campers, this trip was done once a week. But in 1997, the Princess was moved to her new berth at Egmont which helped cut down the travel time by more than 60%, thereby reducing the overall wear & tear on the ship plus reduced significantly the fuel costs. Campers heading to The Bu are now brought to Egmont on charter bus, along the scenic Sunshine Coast highway, via B.C. Ferries Horseshoe Bay to Langdale Terminal.Hitz, Charles W.(2003).

The term curau is used mostly the southern states such as S√£o Paulo, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. It is also called cor√° () in Minas Gerais, papa-de-milho \\"corn porridge\\" in Rio de Janeiro, and canjica in the northern half of Brazil (Northeast and North regions).  Typical recipes  Curau recipes typically call for about 1/2 to 2 liters of milk and 1 to 3 cups of sugar for 10 ears of unripe maize or sweet corn. Other ingredients may be added, such as a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of butter, etc.. The milk may be replaced in part by coconut milk or condensed milk. To prepare the curau, the corn kernels are grated off the ears and put into a cloth bag. The bag is then squeezed while adding the milk little by little, so as to extract as much juice as possible from the ground corn mass. Alternatively, the ground corn and milk may be processed with a blender and then passed through fine sieve. The extracted liquid is combined with the sugar and any other ingredients, and thickened to a creamy consistency by cooking on the stove for about 45 minutes (or in the microwave oven for 12‚Äì15 minutes), stirring frequently. The cream is then poured into appropriate containers (dessert cups, muffin molds, shallow baking pans, etc.) The curau may be served warm or cool (when it acquires a firm custard-like consistency). It is typically dusted with powdered cinnamon.  Curau in popular culture  A giant canjica has been prepared every year since 1999 in the town of Caruaru for the Festa de S√£o Jo√£o in northeast Brazil; the 2008 issue was 35 meters long and used 4,500 ears of corn. In the southern states, the word canjica is used for a different dessert, made with ripe unground white maize kernels, cooked in milk until soft, and which is called mungunz√° doce in the northern half of Brazil.

He served on the Governor's Council 1670-79 and was Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses 1680-82.Kukla, pp. 74-77 Early life and family Thomas was born in about March 1630/1. In 1650, he married Anna Thomas, daughter of William and Anne Thomas of Warwickshire, England. His children included Sarah Ballard, Jane Ballard, John Ballard, Thomas Ballard, Lydia M. Harwood, Martha Margaret Collier, William Ballard, Elizabeth Ladd, Francis Ballard, Matthew Ballard, and one other child that can not be identified (possibly an infant). He also had a brother named John Ballard. Early career From about July 1652-March 1663 he was clerk of York County, where he owned land. He also patented land in Gloucester County along the Mattaponi River and Propotank Creek. He actively bought and sold land throughout the colony for most of his adult life. By 1666 Ballard had moved to James City County, which first elected him to the House of Burgesses that year. He became a close associate of Governor Sir William Berkeley, and was appointed to the Council in June 1670. He was active in the bar, and served as High Sheriff of James City County in 1674. He also became a customs collector. In 1675 he bought a farm in Middle Plantation, the future site of Williamsburg, Virginia. Bacon's Rebellion Ballard sold a tract of land in Henrico County to Nathaniel Bacon in 1675. The following year, as Bacon's public hostility to Berkeley's governorship grew, Ballard attempted to mediate the dispute. In June, he negotiated a brief reconciliation between the two, persuading Berkeley to award Bacon a commission to fight Indians. Bacon went into open rebellion in July, forcing Berkeley to flee to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. On July 30, Bacon declared Ballard a \\"wicked and pernitious counsellor.\\" Four days later, on August 3, Bacon held a meeting at Middle Plantation at which Ballard, among many others, signed an oath of loyalty to him. Ballard also signed papers urging Bacon to call an election and convene the General Assembly. In September, Bacon used Anna Ballard and other councillors' wives as human shields in a clash with Berkeley's forces at Jamestown. After Bacon's death in October, the rebellion collapsed. Ballard served on a number of the ensuing courts-martial that condemned the surviving rebels. In 1677 Berkeley was removed as governor. Lieutenant Governor Herbert Jeffreys removed Ballard from the Council and his customs post, citing his oath to Bacon as proof of his \\"mutinous Spirit\\". Later life Anna Ballard died in 1678. Thomas Ballard later married Alice Hilliard; they had two children. In 1679, instructions from London confirmed that Ballard and Philip Ludwell, two members of the \\"Green Spring faction\\" of diehard Berkeley loyalists, were barred from the Council. Ballard was returned to the House of Burgesses from James City County, and the House chose him as Speaker for the session of 1680-82\\\\. After his service as Speaker, he remained in the House until 1686. He also commanded the county militia during this period. Ballard was a vestryman of Bruton Parish in Middle Plantation when it built its first brick church in 1682-83\\\\. He spent his final years pursuing a lawsuit against Nathaniel Bacon's estate, trying to recover the balance due on the 1675 land sale. Ballard died and was buried at Bruton Parish Church on March 24, 1689.Kukla (p. 77) says this is \\"probably\\" an Old Style (Julian) calendar date, and was therefore in 1690 by the Gregorian calendar. Aftermath Ballard's oldest son and heir, Thomas Ballard, Jr., sold the Middle Plantation estate shortly after his father's death. Most of it went to form the campus of the College of William and Mary.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin. The short was released on May 14, 1938. Plot The cartoon begins with squirrels stockpiling for the forthcoming cold months as hard times will be ahead, as they sing \\"Now that Summer is Gone\\". However, a young, flashy-dressed squirrel decides to get nuts through a dice game without making the effort to hunt them. Disregarding his father's advice not to gamble, the young squirrel pays no attention and still insists on the \\"easy way\\" on getting his nuts for winter. Before the first snowfall, the young squirrel is told to get their winter supply of nuts from the First Nutional [sic] Bank, and just before he leaves the front door, his father reminds him, \\"You will do as I say, and no gambling!\\" But on his way home with the nuts, the young squirrel sees a stranger who offers him a game of chance, and despite his father's warning, the foolish young squirrel quickly jumps at the chance. The foolish young squirrel loses every time at every chance game. Devastated, the squirrel is entirely out of luck and now out of the entire supply of winter nuts. By the time the snow starts falling, the foolish squirrel heads back home without any nuts or any luck in telling his father the truth. So, as soon as he enters his home, he decides to make up a lie and tells his father that he has been robbed by bandits, jumped and badly attacked by them. However, his lying ends very quickly and he goes too far when he discovers that the stranger who won the nuts from him is none other than his own father, who did it to teach his gambling son a lesson for deliberately disobeying him. In spite of this, the lesson, however, does not work. When the disgruntled father concludes that he will give his son ten lashes, and before the young squirrel has a chance to run out the door, he is caught by the tail by his enraged father. As the disgruntled father gets his lashing weapon (a plank) ready, his son tells him that \\"he'll flip him for it, double or nothing,\\" but his father doesn't believe him. As the cartoon irises out and the \\"That's All Folks!\\" ending appears, the foolish squirrel is seen/heard getting lashes from his enraged father.

Steiner (June 6, 1896 ‚Äì February 11, 1989) was a dentist and one of Edward H. Angle's first students in 1921. He developed a form of cephalometric analysis, presented in 1953, referred to as the Steiner method of analysis.  Life  He was born in Rancho Cucamonga, California. His father, Emil Steiner and him, moved to California during the Gold Rush years in 1904. They settled in Imperial Valley where he was part of a school with 12 students. His family homestead a farm in Brawley, California. He attended University of California, Berkeley for his undergraduate education. Dr. Steiner obtained his dental degree from UCSF School of Dentistry at the age of 19. Soon after, he started working in Los Angeles with local Orthodontist named Dr. Ray Robinson. Orthodontic schools at the time spent much time in re-cementing molar bands. He eventually went to Pasadena, California to meet and enroll himself in Angle School of Orthodontia. During the meeting, Dr. Edward Angle asked Steiner about Charles Darwin, which Steiner was not able to answer. Therefore, Steiner was dismissed from the meeting, but Anna Angle asked Steiner to read 20 books and asked him to return for another meeting with Dr. Angle. He returned for another meeting and eventually became Angle's second student in the school in Pasadena. He obtained his degree from there in 1921. He continued working with Angle after his graduation and worked on Ribbon Arch at the school.  Career  He is most-remember for his articles Cephalometrics for You and me (1953), Cephalometrics in Clinical Practice (1959), Use of Cephalometrics as an Aid to Planning and Assessing Orthodontic Treatment (1960). He worked at Angle School of Orthodontia and was also a part-time faculty at the Orthodontics Department in UCSF School of Dentistry. He was instrumental in starting USC Orthodontic Program with Larry L. Dougherty in 1960. The orthodontic department at USC dedicated their library to Dr. steiner due to his contributions to the school. He died at the age of 92 in Longview, Washington. Steiner's Analysis Steiner's Analysis consists of Skeletal, Dental and Soft Tissue Analysis. The skeletal component tries to related the upper and lower to the skull and to each other. The dental component tries to relate the upper and lower incisors to each other and to their respective jaws and the soft tissue component tries to understand the lower facial profile. Skeletal * SNA = This angle helps determine if maxilla is positioned anteriorly or posteriorly to the cranial base * SNB = This angle helps determine if mandible is positioned anteriorly or posteriorly to the cranial base * ANB = This angle helps determine the relationship between maxilla and mandible to each other * Occlusal Plane to SN = Plan that is drawn through cusps of first molars and first premolars. Average is 14 degrees * Mandibular Plane = This plane is drawn by using Gonion (Go) and Gnathion (Gn). The average is 32 degrees. The angle that mandibular plane forms with SN plane helps determine the growth pattern of individuals. Dental * Maxillary Incisor Position = Relationship of upper incisors to the N-A line. Average is 22 degrees and 4 mm. * Mandibular Incisor Position = Relationship of lower incisors to the N-B line. Average is 25 degrees and 4 mm. * Interincisal Angle = Relates position of upper incisor to lower incisor. Average is 130 degrees. * Lower Incisor to Chin = According to Holdway, it is the distance from the distal surface of lower incisor to the N-B line (Nasion - B Point). 4 mm is the average Soft Tissue * S Line (Steiner's Line) = According to Steiner, the lips should touch a line extending from the soft tissue contour of the chin to the middle of an S formed by lower border of the nose. Lips that are beyond this line are protrusive. Awards * 1968 Albert H.

Powerful ‚ÄòNdrangheta boss Tripodo rose to power by ousting the old Reggio boss Domenico Strati after a two-year conflict in 1958-59.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 50 In the 1960s, he formed a sort of triumvirate with Antonio Macr√¨, the boss of the city of Siderno and Girolamo Mommo Piromalli, head of the most powerful 'ndrina on the Tyrrhenian coast. The triumvirate‚Äôs senior position was recognized by all other family chiefs and their advice was in most cases followed without protest.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 60 Tripodo acquired considerable financial resources through tobacco smuggling. He had relations with the Sicilian Mafia and was the \\"compare d‚Äôanello\\" (a kind of best man and trusted friend) of Mafia boss Tot√≤ Riina at his wedding in 1974. According to Enzo Ciconte, a specialist on the 'Ndrangheta and a consultant for the Antimafia Commission, that would only be possible if they would be considered to be of the same rank.

The various disagreement led to bloodshed in the First 'Ndrangheta war, which took place in 1974-76. Tripodo tried to strike first, killing Giovanni De Stefano in 1974. Arrest and death Tripodo did not see the end of the conflict. He was arrested on February 21, 1975, and incarcerated in the Poggioreale prison in Naples. On August 26, 1976, he was stabbed to death in prison on the request of the De Stefano‚Äôs with the help of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) who worked with the De Stefano‚Äôs in drug trafficking.

Retrieved 2012-10-14. :'Considered one of the greatest guitarists Edmonton has ever seen, if not all of Canada, Delorme was a master of flamenco guitar ‚Äì among several other things ‚Äì which he started learning at the age of 14 in reform school, where music apparently saved him from a life of crime.' ::Mike Ross, 2011 Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Gaye Delorme grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, and lived primarily in western Canada, until his death. Delorme was able to play many styles of guitar music including flamenco, classical, jazz (in the styles of Django Reinhardt and Wes Montgomery), country, blues, rock and heavy metal. His wide-ranging skill as a guitarist included the ability to emulate other instruments such as the sitar and the koto. Stevie Ray Vaughan described Delorme as \\"one of the best\\".Delorme not an easy mark . Vancouver Province, January 08, 2008. Retrieved 2012-10-05. Delorme was entirely self-taught, having picked up the guitar at age of fifteen, during a stint in juvenile detention. By 1967, at the age of 19, Delorme had already developed a reputation as a professional musician in Edmonton. At that time, he had left for the music scene in Toronto. In the early 1970s, Delorme led a Jimi Hendrix-styled power trio called The Window in Edmonton, Alberta. Delorme later moved from Edmonton to Calgary, and played in country bands there for a few years. He then formed another trio to play his original rock and blues-oriented tunes, to play the dance club scene in Alberta. Delorme also became a record producer, producing the first demos for Calgary-based band Fosterchild, at Edmonton's Sundown Recorders, owned by Wes Dakus.Dan Brisebois, Profile of Fosterchild; CanadianBands.com. Retrieved 2012-10-05 and 2012-10-29 After a brief move to Vancouver, Delorme returned to Edmonton in the 1990s, and was a mainstay at the Sidetrack Cafe, where he developed a Latin fusion style that at one point featured Gaye leading a 10-piece band with a horn section. (Also in the 1990s, he first learned how to read music.) From roughly 2000 to 2009, Gaye lived in Vancouver, and focused on his writing, recordings and concerts, often appearing solo. All of Delorme's recordings were released on his own label, Aqua Tarta Music. He also performed as a studio musician for a variety of recording artists. In 2009, Gaye moved back to Edmonton.Mike Ross, Memorial Service for Gaye Delorme Set for July 10 at the Polish Hall. Gig City, June 25, 2011. Retrieved 2012-10-12. Collaborations Delorme played with many musicians and groups including Jann Arden, the Powder Blues Band, Lenny Breau, David Foster, Airto Moreira, Billy Cobham and Stanley Clarke. In 2006 he was accompanied by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra for his performance of Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez. 1986 saw Delorme record a one-hour special for CBC television entitled Gaye Delorme in Concert. As well as composing and playing guitar, he produced k.d. lang's first album A Truly Western Experience, in addition to his previously referenced production work with Fosterchild. The LA Years Delorme first came to Los Angeles at the initiative of David Foster, then a member of Skylark. The band had lost its guitarist, and Delorme was selected as the replacement. During the 1970s and 1980s, Delorme lived in Los Angeles, collaborating frequently with Cheech and Chong, most notably writing the signature guitar riff for Cheech and Chong's anthem \\"Earache My Eye\\". The immediately recognizable guitar riff became part of the modern musical lexicon, with numerous covers of \\"Earache My Eye\\" recorded by heavy metal, punk and even hip-hop artists. His long-running association with Cheech and Chong included musical contributions to Cheech and Chong's Next Movie (1980), and culminated with Delorme scoring their film Things Are Tough All Over (1982). The drug- and alcohol-fueled atmosphere of LA was taking a heavy toll on Delorme by the mid-1980s, so he moved back to his native Canada. Comedy Delorme was often involved in Cheech and Chong's improvised writing process, and humor was integral to his audience rapport during live performances. His own comedy caused a buzz in 1980 when \\"The Rodeo Song\\" was released by Garry Lee and the Showdown. The single resulted in a CRIA double-platinum record.Canadian Recording Industry Association The song quickly became a cult favorite and was compiled by Dr. Demento on Demento's Mementos, and was used in the Stephen King film Sleepwalkers (1992). Delorme's own version of \\"The Rodeo Song\\" was released on the album Rodeo Songs, in 2002. Up to his death, Delorme was never invited to any of Cheech & Chong's reunion concerts; when they came to Vancouver, they never mentioned Delorme's participation in \\"Earache My Eye\\". One night after a gig, leaving New Westminster Skytrain station, he was attacked and beaten by a group of muggers, causing him to suffer a stroke; the thugs also stole his guitar, which has never been recovered. The Yale Hotel held several benefits to help pay Delorme's medical bills. Awards Delorme was nominated for a Grammy Award, and received the Alberta Premier's Award For Excellence, for his lifelong commitment to furthering Alberta musical talent. Later life and death In 2000, Delorme was the inaugural artist to be honoured by the Pacific Coast Music Association in its Celebrate series. Delorme was a diabetic and had become legally blind from the disease, as of 2008. Delorme died of a heart attack in Calgary, during the early hours of June 24, 2011, while staying at the home of a friend. He was 64 years old, and was due to perform at the Calgary Bluesfest Warmup on June 25, 2011, with his longtime sideman, keyboardist Peter Sweetzir.

This was not enough to win the match, as Durham were unable to match Warwickshire's 223, losing the match by an innings and 23 runs. Allen was a regular in the side from 1965‚Äì1968 and made his sole List A appearance in 1968, playing in the first round of the Gillette Cup, scoring two runs before being bowled out by seven- time Test cricketer Len Coldwell, in his penultimate year before retiring from first-class cricket. Allen took part in a single-innings match between Durham and the USA, at Ashbrooke, in which he scored 48 runs. The following week, Allen hit his only century, 123 runs, nearly double his second-best score, against Cumberland in August 1968.

Paoli became known as the \\"father of the poor\\" due to his strong charitable outreach towards those who were poor and sick, for which he received praise from a number of cardinals and other prelates while living in Rome. This extended to his friend Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Tomasi and to popes Innocent XII and Clement XI who both offered him the cardinalate, which he refused. Paoli's beatification was celebrated on 25 April 2010 in the Basilica di San Giovanni Laterano, with Archbishop Angelo Amato presiding on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life Francesco Paoli was born on 1 September 1642 in Argigliano as the eldest of seven children (three brothers and three sisters) to the peasants Angelo Paoli and Santa Morelli (d. 1654); one brother was Tommaso. His parents named him in honor of Francis of Assisi to whom they had a strong devotion. As a child and adolescent he spent the greater part of his leisure time teaching Catholic doctrine to the poor children of Argigliano. He attended grammar school in Minucciano where his maternal uncle was Father Morelli, the assistant priest. On 27 November 1660 he was admitted into the Carmelites at the convent of Cerignano in Fivizzano alongside his brother Tommaso. The two brothers returned home for several months before receiving the habit in Fivizzano, and then deciding to go to Siena to the convent of San Nicola for the novitiate (their father escorted them); Paoli assumed the religious name of \\"Angelo\\" in honor of his father. He made his vows on 18 December 1661 and then spent a prolonged period doing his philosophical and theological studies in both Pisa ‚Äì at the convent of Santa Maria del Carmine ‚Äì and Florence. He was made a subdeacon on 20 December 1665 and was elevated into the diaconate on 19 December 1666. Paoli was ordained to the priesthood in Florence in 1667 and celebrated there his first Mass on 7 January. He was a sacristan and organist from his ordination until 1674 in Florence but was forced to return home for health reasons. On 15 August 1674 he distributed bread to the poor; it was deemed a miracle that the bread in the basket never depleted. He did not want to be recognized for this so he retreated into the mountains of Garfagana as a hermit, though each dawn he went to the shrine of San Pellegrino to celebrate Mass. In 1674 he was sent to Argigliano and Pistoia and then in 1675 was sent as the Master of Novices to Florence for eighteen months, then transferred to Carniola as a pastor from December 1676 to October 1677; ten months later in 1677 he was sent to Siena. In 1680 he was sent to Montecatini and in 1682 was charged with teaching grammar to novices. Paoli was then appointed to a parish in Pisa for active service in 1682 but was later transferred to Cupoli, Monte Catino and Fivizzano a few months later as an organist and sacristan. He had a special devotion to the Passion and he caused wooden crosses to be erected on the hills around Fivizzano, to bring this devotion to the minds of others to reflect on the love the Redeemer had for mankind. He often said: \\"Whoever loves God must go to find Him among the poor.\\" In 1687 the Prior-General Paolo di Sant'Ignazio summoned him to Rome where he arrived on 12 March before being stationed at the church Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti; he would remain here for the rest of his life. Paoli arrived with nothing more than his breviary and a small white bag with a little bit of bread. He first passed through his hometown to bid farewell to his aging father and his siblings and then to Siena to bid farewell to his Carmelite friar brother Tommaso. He spent the remainder of his life divided between the care of the sick and the poor in hospitals and then the office of Master of Novices which he held. Paoli approached Pope Clement XI in 1708 and asked him for a restoration of the Coliseum since it should be their task to honor those killed for their faith there and to place wooden crosses there to honor them; Paoli also wanted to convince the pope to halt the pilfering of stone from the Coliseum. The pope was hesitant at first but allowed Paoli to gather volunteers to fix the place and had large wooden crosses placed there, which had been his dream. Paoli managed to do this on Mount Testaccio. He also distinguished himself during two earthquakes at the start of 1703 in aiding the victims that were either displaced or injured. He fed the poor and provided them with blankets and clothes and while visiting hospitals gave them medicine and provided them comfort in their suffering. In 1710 he opened a hospice for the poor of the area. Paoli received offers from both Pope Innocent XII and from Clement XI to be received into the cardinalate ‚Äì once for 21 June 1700 ‚Äì but the friar refused for he feared that he might not be able to spend as much time with the poor. On the offers he said: \\"It would have been hurtful to the poor whom I would not have been able to help\\" due to the stringent demands of the cardinalate. He also befriended Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Tomasi who was the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti. Paoli was playing the organ on 14 January 1720 when a high fever struck him and confined him to his cell. He died on 20 January 1720 ‚Äì a Saturday ‚Äì at 6:45 am and his remains were interred in Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti; the pope himself ordered the inscription on the tomb titling Paoli as \\"venerable\\" and as the \\"father of the poor\\" like others had called him. There were a great number of nobles and common folk in addition to cardinals and those in the episcopate who attended his funeral. Pope Clement XI was pained to learn of Paoli's death and in a letter to the order dubbed Paoli the \\"father of the poor\\". Beatification The informative phase for the beatification cause opened in Rome in 1723 and concluded sometime later, but also oversaw its business in Florence and in Pescia. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Clement XII on 14 July 1739 and Paoli became titled as a Servant of God. At an apostolic process held from 1740 until 1754. Pope Pius VI confirmed that the late friar had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 21 January 1781. The three miracles that would have ‚Äì in those times centuries back - led to his beatification never received approval so the cause seemed to stall despite even the order's 1908 effort at a General Chapter to revive it. But the impetus needed came in 1927 with the miraculous healing of a woman that was investigated on a diocesan level. That also stalled but was revitalized when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the diocesan process for the miracle on 9 March 2007. Medical experts approved this healing to be a miracle on 29 May 2008, as did theologians on 20 December 2008 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 26 May 2009. The process culminated on 3 July 2009 when Pope Benedict XVI signed a decree that recognized this 1927 healing was in fact a miracle attributed to Paoli's intercession and thus approved that the late Carmelite friar would be beatified. The Secretariat of State announced the formal date for the beatification in a 9 January 2010 communique. Archbishop Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on 25 April 2010 in the Basilica di San Giovanni Laterano; the Cardinal Vicar of Rome Agostino Vallini was also in attendance. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Giovanna Brizi. References ;Attribution * The entry cites: *Analecta ordinis Carmelitarum, fasc. I-XII.

Erected in 1939 as the Apostolic Prefecture of Bhamo, the prefecture was created from territory in the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Burma. In 1961, the Prefecture was elevated to a full diocese, suffragan to the Archdiocese of Mandalay. The current bishop is Francis Daw Tang, appointed in 2004. Currently the Diocese manages numerous churches, schools and clinics throughout Kachin State. Pre-History Before the Diocese was fully established, the first footprints of Catholicism in Myitkyina were set in 1856, when French Bishop Paul Bigandet M.E.P. visited the northern region of Burma. Seventeen years later, in 1873, a trio of priests were dispatched to begin the early works of the Diocese.

Munguambe served as Deputy Minister of Trade in the early 1990s, and was appointed as Minister of Transport and Communication by President Armando Guebuza on February 3, 2005, when Guebuza named his new government shortly after taking office. He was removed from office (along with foreign minister Alcinda Abreu and justice minister Esperan√ßa Machavela) on March 10, 2008, and was succeeded by Paulo Zucula, the former director of Mozambique's National Disasters Management Institute. Although Guebuza offered no official reason for Munguambe's dismissal from office, various news reports suggested that it was tied to the transportation-related riots in Maputo in February that caused between four and six deaths. The riots were sparked by increases of up to 50 percent in the fares for the chapas (privately owned minibus taxis) that account for a significant portion of the capital's passenger transport. According to the Mozambique Workers' Organization, the country's largest national trade union centre, Mozambican workers spend an average of 35 percent of their income on transportation. The hike was negotiated by Munguambe and the Federation of Road Transport Associations following an increase in the fuel costs (the government raised the price of diesel by 14 percent on January 23). After the outbreak of rioting on February 5, Munguambe declared that \\"[t]he increase is fair and also the complaints by commuters are fair\\", and promised to renegotiate with transport operators. On February 6, the government rescinded the fares increase, and in exchange promised to provide fuel subsidies to licensed transport operators, so that they could in effect purchase diesel at the price prior to January 23 (31.0 meticais per litre, as opposed to 35.35 per litre). Munguambe was imprisoned in 2010 for his part in embezzling $1.7 million from state-owned airports company Aeroportos de Mo√ßambique. His original sentence of 20 years was cut to 8 years on appeal, of which he served half, and was freed in 2013.

In 2018, Cosculluela was caught up in a controversy after fellow Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA released a diss track. Early life and education Cosculluela was born on October 15, 1980, to a Cuban father and a Puerto Rican mother. He came from an upper-class family and was raised in the gated community of Palmas del Mar. At a young age, Cosculluela became interested in tennis and eventually played for his high school, Colegio San Antonio Abad. He also developed passions for golf and surfing.  Career  At the age of sixteen, Cosculluela began producing underground mixtapes with his brother Jaime and his friends. After a few years of recording underground, popular Reggaeton producer DJ Buddha found out about Cosculluela's talents in a San Juan studio. Buddha was working with well-known Latin hip hop producer Echo at the time. DJ Buddha selected Cosculluela to replace rapper Tempo in the hip hop group Buddha's Family. Cosculluela gained national recognition in 2004 with his underground demo \\"Este Es Mi Momento\\" and for his frequent collaborations with Yomo. Echo eventually signed Cosculluela to his label, Invasion Music. Cosculluela gained international recognition with the hit single \\"Te Va Ir Mal\\" (feat. Getto) from the album Buddha's Family 2 distributed by Machete Music/Universal Latino. Soon after, Cosculluela began working with famed producers Gocho and Alex Gargolas for multiple compilation albums. He also released a reworked version of his classic mixtape, \\"Este Es Mi Momento\\", in 2006. After this, Cosculluela moved up in the ranks of Reggaeton, appearing on such albums as Los Bandoleros: Reloaded, Invasion, Gargolas, Los Bravos, El Pentagono, El Pentagono: The Return, Los Brother, Talento de Barrio, and many more. Cosculluela is known to many as \\"El Principe del Verso\\" (The Prince of Verse) because of his exceptional lyrical abilities as an MC. Echo was unable to get Universal Latino to release an album from any of his artists and only saw his compilation album \\"Invasion vol. 1\\" distributed. This caused Cosculluela to leave Invasion in 2007 and sign a recording contract with the renowned executive producer Elias De Le√≥n and his influential record label White Lion Records. After struggling with record executives to set a release for his debut album, which was originally meant to be distributed on Sony Latin, and after various delays in 2009, Machete Music was pressured into releasing Cosculluela's hit debut album, \\"El Principe\\" (The Prince). It was released thanks to Cosculluela's friendship with Wisin y Yandel, who had a partnership with Universal Latino for their record label WY Records and were very influential at the company due to their immense success and popularity. El Pr√≠ncipe In 2009, Cosculluela released his first album, El Pr√≠ncipe. The album was announced a year earlier and it was named after one of his nicknames. . It peaked at number three on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and spawned the hit singles \\"Na Na Nau\\", \\"Prrrum\\", and \\"Plaka Plaka\\". It also reached number eight on the Billboard Rap Albums chart. A few tracks were left out of the final production. El Principe was one of the most successful reggaeton albums of the year, becoming critically acclaimed due to its diversity in lyrics and style. El Principe: Ghost Edition In 2010, Cosculluela released his first album called El Principe: Ghost Edition. This album was a review of his first album, but with 5 new tracks. These 5 tracks were Cuidau Au Au, Humo, Prrrum Remix ft. Nardo Ranks, and Another Prrrum Remix. They were performed with Wisin & Yandel, and the last track was De Noche y De Dia feat. Yandel. El Ni√±o El Ni√±o comes with many romantic, hip hop and reggaeton lyrics. Collaborations that have been announced so far are Wisin & Yandel and Los Mafiaboyz. Two singles have been released so far, they are: \\"Blam Blam\\" and \\"Si T√∫ No Est√°s.\\" The remix of \\"Si T√∫ No Est√°s\\" will feature Puerto Rican artist Farruko, Colombian sensation J-Balvin and the duo √ëejo & Dalmata.  War Kingz (2012)  War Kingz is the name of Cosculluela's first mixtape, which came out on December 11, 2012. This album helped new talents within the artist's company to apply themselves within the urban environment. Blanco Perla In 2014 Cosculluela left Universal Latino which lead to a bidding war among Latin labels to sign him, thanks to his success and much-publicized rap battle against Tempo. Warner Music Latina won the right to distribute Cosculluela's works through his Rottweilas Inc imprint and immediately began work on his latest album \\"Blanco Perla\\". Cosculluela released the hit single \\"Baby Boo\\" featuring renowned hitmakers Wise \\"The Gold Pen\\" and DJ Luian to prepare for his upcoming release. Although he began 2015 with a domestic violence charge, he otherwise enjoyed major success that year. He released the smash hit \\"Te Busco\\" with Nicky Jam, the first single from his album Blanco Perla. In October 2016, he released the album, which features major hits such as \\"Te Busco\\", \\"Manicomio\\", and \\"La Boda\\", the latter of which is about his wedding, which occurred in November 2015; it features singer O'Neill as well as an intro by rapper Kendo Kaponi. The album also features collaborations with artists such as Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, Farruko, Arcangel, De La Ghetto, and Tempo. Blanco Perla remains Cosculluela's most notable work in terms of popularity as the artist decided to leave behind his hardcore hip hop roots in favour of the modern mainstream reggaeton sound of artists such as J Balvin and Nicky Jam. Hit singles from the album such as \\"Te Busco\\" feat. Nicky Jam, Manicomio, \\"La Boda\\", and \\"A Donde Voy\\" featuring Daddy Yankee have garnered hundreds of millions of plays through various streaming platforms and become some of the most well-known songs of Cosculluela's catalogue. Controversy On September 15, 2018, Anuel AA released a diss track aimed at Cosculluela. The track was widely criticized due to its foul language and offensive remarks about homosexuality and HIV patients. Two years later, amid the George Floyd protests around the world, the urban artist expressed through Instagram Live that Afro-Puerto Ricans are not descendants of Africa. This is contrary to the basic teachings of the Puerto Rican education system that educate on the history and colonization process of Puerto Rico which included the African slave trade that lasted almost 500 years, and the vast and evident African influence on Puerto Rican culture (along with European Spanish and indigenous Ta√≠no influences). Although he did not clarify where he believed the Afro-Puerto Ricans are originally from, in his insulting expressions of June 7, 2020, he also called for Puerto Ricans to not join in on protests, calling the demonstrations a \\"crap that affects the economy\\". Later that day, the urban artist issued an apology.

France and credited with working miracles. To all appearances it is a work of the thirteenth century; it is carved from a block of alabaster about twenty inches in height and represents Mary, the mother of Jesus, clad in Oriental drapery and holding the Divine Infant on her right arm. History Blessed Thomas Illyricus of Osimo (born about the middle of the fifteenth century), a Franciscan friar who had retired to the forest solitude of Arcachon, is said to have found this statue, much battered by the waves, on the seashore. He immediately constructed a wooden chapel which was replaced, a century later, by a spacious stone sanctuary. This, in turn, was so menaced by the drifting sands of the dunes as to necessitate the erection in 1723 of a new church on a neighbouring hill overlooking the Bay of Arcachon. The statue survived both revolutions and was granted the honour of a coronation, by a brief of Pope Pius IX, on 15 July 1870. Devotion to Our Lady of Arcachon spread far and wide, and the shrine became a centre of pilgrimage. Before 1842 the church had been surrounded only by a few fishermen's huts, but with the erection of villas and the discovery of the salubrious climate of the area people began to flock to the spot, which is now the centre of a flourishing town.

The book alleges Obama's \\"extreme leftism\\", \\"extensive connections with Islam and radical politics\\", \\"na√Øve... foreign policy\\", past drug use and connections to corrupt backers, among other things. The book has been criticized for containing factual errors, for being racially charged, and for being a political \\"attack book\\" containing smears, falsehoods, and innuendo.  Content  Corsi said his purpose in writing the book was to defeat Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election. In the book, he recounts Barack Obama's upbringing and early political career in Chicago and argues that Obama is an \\"extreme leftis[t]\\" who should not be elected president. The book claims to document \\"Obama's extensive connections with Islam and radical politics\\", his \\"religious affiliation with ... black-liberation theology\\", and his associations with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, fundraiser Tony Rezko, and radical activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, formerly of the Weather Underground. The book also argues that Obama supports \\"far-left domestic policy\\" and \\"na√Øve... foreign policy predicated on the reduction of the military\\", and that he is therefore unsuitable to be the President of the United States. The book opens with a quote by Andy Martin, who The Nation, The Washington Post,Mosk, Matthew. An Attack That Came Out of the Ether. The Washington Post, 2008-10-14. and The New York Times have identified as the primary source for the allegations that Obama is concealing an alleged Muslim faith, rumors which began shortly after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Author and publication The book's author, Jerome Corsi, has written on a number of controversial topics. In 2007 he wrote a book exposing a supposed plot to replace the United States dollar with international currency.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/world/americas/25iht-25Amero.8473833.html He has accused a \\"Muslim terrorist group\\" of supporting John McCain, and has called for the impeachment of George W. Bush. He endorsed the 9/11 Truth Movement, which questions official and mainstream accounts of the September 11, 2001 attacks. During the 2004 United States presidential election, he co- wrote Unfit for Command, a book associated with Swift Vets and POWs for Truth that was critical of Democratic candidate John Kerry. He is a regular contributor at conservative internet publication WorldNetDaily, which is well known for publicizing conspiracy theories about Obama's citizenship. The book was published by Threshold Editions, a division of CBS-owned Simon & Schuster, whose chief editor is Republican party political strategist Mary Matalin. The title is intentionally assonant with abomination. Corsi was detained by Kenyan immigration officials and then deported for attempting to promote the book without a work permit.  Responses = Obama campaign response  In response to the book, the Obama campaign issued a 40-page response, \\"unfit for publication\\" (playing on the Corsi co-authored 2004 book Unfit for CommandUnfit for Publication) on the campaign website fightthesmears.com, objecting to assertions made in the book and alleging factual errors. The campaign also issued a press release, reading in part: The Obama campaign also said it would \\"push back against this year's vicious Republican attack book.\\" In addition, the Democratic National Committee joined the \\"counteroffensive\\" telling its supporters by email: \\"The media have shown that they aren't going to stop him. It's up to you to spread the truth, so here it is. Below you will find the facts about Corsi and his desperate fabrications.\\" Other responses When asked for a comment about the book, John McCain said, \\"Gotta keep your sense of humor,\\" but his campaign said McCain did not hear the question, and the campaign had no comment. In response to the book's publication, Senator John Kerry, the subject of a previous book by Corsi during his 2004 campaign for presidency, launched the website \\"Truth Fights Back\\" to rebut the claims. Media Matters for America, which describes itself as a progressive organization dedicated to countering \\"conservative misinformation in the U.S. media\\", has given details of what it says are numerous instances of inaccuracies in the book and in Corsi's statements promoting the work. Paul Waldman of Media Matters appeared with Corsi on Larry King Live when they discussed the claims.Larry King Live: TRANSCRIPT: Controversial Book On Obama. Aired August 13, 2008. MSNBC's Contessa Brewer confronted Corsi with these alleged inaccuracies; Corsi disputed Media Matters' allegations.  Reception and critical review  Released on August 1, 2008, the book was #4 in sales in nonfiction during the first week of its release and subsequently rose to #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover non-fiction books within two weeks, due in part to higher bulk sales. This has led some Obama supporters to suspect that conservative groups have made bulk purchases to inflate sales, something Corsi denies. On September, 8 it was second to Tori Spelling's book. Corsi posted his first Obamabucks from the sale of his book on the wall of a coffee shop in Washington. Corsi's book has been criticized for inaccuracies by news organizations such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, U.S. News & World Report, the Associated Press, Time magazine, Newsweek, The Daily Telegraph, Editor & Publisher, The Guardian, CNN, The Independent, Politifact.com, and The Boston Globe. According to The New York Times, \\"several of the book's accusations, in fact, are unsubstantiated, misleading or inaccurate.\\" Peter Wehner of Commentary wrote: \\"conservatives should not hitch their hopes to\\" Corsi's book because \\"it seems to be riddled with factual errors -- some relatively minor (like asserting that Obama does not mention the birth of his half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, in Dreams from My Father; Obama does mention her), and some significant (suggesting that Obama favors withdrawing troops from Afghanistan; he wants to do the opposite).\\" The Washington Post called it an \\"innuendo-filled, mistake-riddled biography\\" in its online election diary The Trail. Kate Linthicum of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"being No. 1 [on the best seller list] doesn't necessarily mean being accurate\\" in regard to Corsi's claims about Obama's religious faith. Politico reported that Corsi's book \\"left a trail of wild theories, vitriol and dogma that have called into question his credibility.\\" The British newspaper The Independent called Corsi's book \\"a hatchet job on Obama\\". According to Slate, \\"neither Corsi nor Matalin responded to e-mails from me asking whether they intended to correct any errors in The Obama Nation - it would be a miracle if there were none\\" [emphasis in original]. The book also contains what The Washington Post describes as \\"potentially offensive passages\\" about Barack Obama's personal and family life, such as one stating that Obama is less identified with his American roots than his \\"African blood\\". Corsi also writes: \\"Obama's mother chose another Third World prospect for her second husband, a second man of color, to be her mate\\", noted by CNN as \\"lines some might consider racially insensitive.\\" The Los Angeles Times also pointed to a line by Corsi claiming \\"Obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black,\\" citing \\"bigoted comments.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times called it \\"an abomination,\\" and said the book \\"exploits racial fears [and] hate in [an] effort to scare white America.\\" Corsi has drawn criticism for scheduling an appearance to promote the book on The Political Cesspool, a \\"pro-White\\" radio talk show described as \\"white nationalist\\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He previously appeared on the show on July 20, but he cancelled his August 17 appearance, citing a change of \\"travel plans.\\"The Political Cesspool: Corsi backs out. August 17, 2008. Disputed accuracy The New York Times noted the book's assertion that Obama attended an incendiary sermon by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright in Chicago on a date when Obama was in fact giving a speech in Florida. The article further noted Corsi's assertion that Obama had \\"yet to answer\\" if he had stopped using drugs. The State Journal-Register of Springfield, Illinois reported Obama's response to a question about his drug use: \\"I haven't done anything since I was 20 years old.\\" Corsi told the Times that \\"self-reporting, by people who have used drugs, as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable.\\" (Obama has also answered the question in the autobiography that Corsi reviews in his book.) In the book, Corsi says that Obama may still be using drugs today, but does not provide evidence for this claim. The Times further noted that while Obama is a Christian, the book contains statements arguing that he has \\"extensive connections to Islam\\". One of Corsi's statements is that Obama's childhood friend, Zulfin Adi, had stated that Obama was a practicing Muslim. Contradicting that, Kim Barker, a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune reported: \\"Interviews with dozens of former classmates, teachers, neighbors and friends show that Obama was not a regular practicing Muslim when he was in Indonesia\\". Corsi also fails to reveal that Adi later said he couldn't be certain about his claims and confessed to knowing Obama for only a few months. Corsi provided the wrong date of the Obamas' marriage, according to the Obama campaign. When discussing the house Barack and Michelle Obama bought in 2005, Corsi cites a February 1, 2008 Salon.com article for the claim that Chicago businessman Tony Rezko \\"found the house for Obama.\\"The Obama Nation, by Jerome Corsi, page 165; Salon.com, \\"How Close Were Barack Obama and Tony Rezko?\\" In a 2007 interview with the staff of the Chicago Sun-Times, Barack Obama asserted that it was his wife who found the house. FactCheck described the book as \\"a mishmash of unsupported conjecture, half-truths, logical fallacies and outright falsehoods.\\" FactCheck's review also stated that, \\"A comprehensive review of all the false claims in Corsi's book would itself be a book.\\"  See also  *Swiftboating  Citations  External links  *The first chapter of The Obama Nation, provided by The New York Times Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:Books about Barack Obama Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States ","title":"The Obama Nation"},{"id":"18724890","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Kengtung (Lat: Diocesis Kengtunghensis) is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in Burma.

(b. at Constantinople, 18 July 1782; d. at Vienna, 6 May 1854), was an Armenian Catholic abbot and archbishop. Life Azaria was sent at the age of fifteen to the Collegio Urbano of Propaganda Fidei in Rome, but his studies were interrupted in 1798 by the invasion of Italy by the French Revolutionary Army. He fled Rome and took refuge at the monastery of the Armenian Mechitarists of Trieste, and entered their Order in 1801. In the same year he was ordained a Catholic priest. The authorities of the short- lived Kingdom of Illyria, set up as a client state of the Austrian Empire, confiscated the property of his monastery in 1810. After futile attempts to obtain restitution, the monks moved to Austria and established the Mekhitarist Monastery of Vienna. There they lived by the instruction of Armenian youth and the revenue from a printing press they set up to provide liturgical and scholarly books in the Armenian language. Azaria was henceforth active as a missionary among his compatriots and a servant of the Holy See. In 1826 he was made Abbot General of the Order, and in 1827 he was named the Titular Archbishop of Caesarea. Under him the Mechitarist community in Vienna prospered, its library was increased, a bookstore added to the printing press, and an abundant religious literature created, in Armenian and in German. Azaria opened houses of his community in Rome, Triest, and Stamboul, founded the Armenian journal Europa, established an academy for the literary and political improvement of his people, and in 1830 obtained from the Holy See the creation of an independent Catholic Armenian patriarchate. After a visit to Rome (1850) in the interest of monastic reform, he returned to Vienna (1852) where he died after the celebration of his golden jubilee. Works Azaria wrote several works, among them De Vit√¢ Communi Perfecta Religiosorum Utriusque Sexus, in which he criticizes the condition of many Austrian religious houses, and Die Erziehung im Geiste des Christenthumes (Vienna, 1839).

He wrote principally in the essay form, although his limited production included short stories and scholarly works as well. Considered one of the best prose stylists of Latin America, he was admitted to the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua in 1952. His parents were Julio S. Torri and Sof√≠a Maynes de Torri. Biography=Education He began his schooling in Colegio Torre√≥n and later in the Escuela Juan Antonio de la Fuente, both in Saltillo. In 1908 he travelled to Mexico City and in 1913 obtained a law degree from the National Law School; in 1933 he was awarded a doctorate in letters from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM). Career He formed part of the Ateneo de la Juventud, a literary generation that also included Rafael Cabrera, Jesus T. Acevedo, Alfonso Cravioto, Antonio Caso, Ricardo G√≥mez Robledo, Enrique Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez, Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a, Salvador Novo, Alfonso Reyes, Diego Rivera, Jos√© Vasconcelos, and Luis G. Urbina. He engaged from 1914-22 in voluminous correspondence with Alfonso Reyes, who during that time was residing in Europe. From 1916-23 he co-edited with Agust√≠n Loera the editorial Cultura. He was founder and director of the SEP's Departamento de Bibliotecas (Department of Libraries) and served as its literary classics editor. In 1921 he founded, along with Xavier Guerrero, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and Vicente Lombardo Toledano, the syndicalist Grupo Solidario del Movimiento Obrero. He taught literature for nearly half a century at several institutions, including the National Preparatory School, the UNAM, and for various summers at the University of Texas, holding from 1953 onward the title of UNAM Emeritus Professor. He undertook poetic and pedagogical ambassadorships to countries like Argentina, Brazil, and the United States, while a trip to Europe in 1952 inspired some of his writing. In 2001 CONACULTA and the Coahuilan Institute of Culture (Icocult) established the Premio Nacional de Cuento Joven Julio Torri, a prize for young writers that honors Julio Torri. Family His nephew, Julio Torri Cervi, (1932‚Äì2003) was a famous eccentric who lived for a time in Tulancingo. Literary oeuvre Torri's oeuvre was distinctly influenced by his readings of Charles Lamb, Marcel Schwob, Jules Renard, Jules Laforgue, St√©phane Mallarm√©, and above all Oscar Wilde. He produced notable essays on Aeschylus, Maeterlinck, Proust, Tolstoy, Aldous Huxley, Jos√© Juan Tablada, Reyes, and Luis Gonzaga Urbina. He was a translator of works by Pascal and Heinrich Heine. As an author his preferred forms were the essay (which put on display his impressive learning and culture) and the short story. He is credited with being one of the earliest practitioners of prose poetry and writers of estampas (literary sketches) in Mexico; he is also noted for his mastery of the epigraph. He was a fastidious writer who endlessly polished and refined his words, clarity and purity were the hallmarks of his style. His most important works are Ensayos y Poemas (Essays and Poems) (1917), De fusilamientos (On Executions [Fusillations]) (1940), Tres libros (Three Books) (1964), Di√°logo de los libros (Dialogue of the Books) (1980, posthumous).

The introduction of extracorporeal circulation has facilitated open heart surgery. The development of modern techniques in extracorporeal circulation is the result of the combined efforts of physiologists, physicians, and engineers. During the first half of the 20th century scientists refined their methods in the development of extracorporeal circulation so that it could be used in humans. In 1937 Gibbon reports the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation in animals (in this case, cats). On May 6, 1953 Gibbon performed his first successful operation using an extracorporeal circuit in an 18-year-old woman who had a large atrial septum defect with a large left-to-right shunt. It was Lillehei who one year later introduced the bubble oxygenator, simple and inexpensive, opening the doors of open heart surgery to all surgeons around the world. The first commercial minimized extracorporeal circulation was the CorX System from Cardiovention, a start-up company from the USA. This system included an integrated centrifugal pump ‚Äì polypropylene oxygenator, a complete heparin-coated surface and a low priming volume. One of the most effective Mini-Systems (MECC Maquet) was introduced almost at the same time (1999). The increasing application in clinical practice explains this machine's success. The benefits of this type of extracorporeal circulation are that a lower consumption of blood and blood products is observed in the peri-operative and post-operative phase and that a lower inflammatory response is being measured in peri-operative blood samples in comparison to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass.

Bypassing the city Lead elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division had reached the Karbala area on 31 March. After fighting through Republican Guard forces southeast of the city, these forces bypassed the city and attacked through the Karbala Gap towards Baghdad. The task of clearing the city was left to the 101st Airborne Division, supported by the 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor Regiment with Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Division.http://www.irontigers.org/index.html On 2 April, a U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed near Karbala, killing 7 soldiers.

At 11:00 a.m. on 5 April, the 101st Airborne began its push to clear Karbala when airstrikes hit several targets around the city. This was followed by a helicopter assault in which 23 UH-60 Blackhawk and 5 CH-47 Chinook helicopters ferried three battalions of infantry from the 502nd Infantry Regiment to their designated landing zones. 3rd Battalion, 502nd Infantry at LZ Sparrow met heavy but disorganized resistance as they moved into the city. To the south, 2/502 at LZ Robin was also moving street by street, and discovered several arms caches hidden in schools. They also discovered a suspected insurgent training camp. By nightfall, 2/502 had cleared 13 of their 30 assigned sectors. 1/502, advancing from LZ Finch in the southeast, captured several weapons caches. Air support from helicopter gunships was used heavily during this operation, and artillery support was also used. Over 100 smoke shells were fired from supporting artillery to screen infantry moving through Karbala's streets. At the same time, 2/70 Armored Regiment and C Co 1/41 IN (Mechanized) had reached Karbala and were engaged in combat, losing 1 man killed from small arms fire and a Bradley to an RPG hit. The next day, the units continued to clear their sectors. Resistance evaporated by 5:00 PM on 6 April. At 5:30, a large statue of Saddam Hussein was torn down by members of the 2/70, 1st Armored Division. For their actions in Karbala, 3rd Battalion, 502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division was awarded the Valorous Unit Award.

He wrote under the patronage of Gaston Phoebus, Count of Foix, and Peter the Ceremonious, King of Aragon. He is one of the few troubadours known by name who lived for a time at Peter's court in Barcelona. His name in standardised Occitan is Peire or P√®ire, in Catalan it is Pere, and in modern French Pierre. An obscure reference to a Pere Riu among some jongleurs from Puigcerd√† near Foix in October 1344 may be to Peyre, but it is impossible to tell. The Pedro who was a jongleur of the count of Foix, mentioned in an Aragonese register of June 1357, may be Peyre de Rius. So may be Pere Rui√ß (perhaps an error for Riu√ß), minstrel of the count of Foix, of July 1368. Peyre appears frequently in the court registers of Aragon for the years between 1361 and 1381, often changing his precise occupation and his patron.It must be allowed that there may be more than one jongleur/minstrel in all these references. All biographical references are drawn from Andr√©s Descalzo, \\"Comentarios sobre algunos trovadores al servicio de Pedro IV o de paso por su corte\\", Recerca Musicol√≥gica, IX-X (1989-90), 298-300. His first recorded appearance at the Aragonese court was 16 September 1361, when he was paid as a minstrel in the service of Gaston Phoebus. The first reference to him as a troubadour is in a document of 19 January 1372, when the court was at Alca√±iz; he was again in the service of the count of Foix. In February 1373 he and Jacme Fluvia, both titled trobador de danses (or dan√ßes, \\"composers of dansas\\"), received gifts from the queen, Eleanor of Sicily. By 11 May 1373 he was again in the household of the king himself, and as a minstrel. On 25 June 1380 he was in the service of Foix and a troubadour. In his last appearance in documents, he is recorded as receiving gifts from the new queen, Sibil¬∑la de Forti√†, for service as a trobador de can√ßons de casa del comte de Foix (troubadour of cansos of the House of Foix). Of Peyre's work only one canso survives, in the Can√ßoner Vega-Aguil√≥ compiled in the 1420s. Mart√≠n de Riquer, who gave the piece its first modern edition, could not identify Peyre's dialect nor his place of origin on the basis of his language.See his \\"Le troubadour Peyre de Rius et Gaston F√©bus, comte de Foix\\". Annales du Midi, 66 (1954), 269-273\\\\. He may therefore be considered \\"Catalan\\". The poem is dedicated to Gaston Phoebus and is an extended gloss on the three things which delight the count, according to the prologue of Gaston's Livre de la chass: \\"tout mon temps me suis d√©lit√© par esp√©cial en trois chose: l'une est en armes, l'autre est en amours, et l'autre si est en chasse.\\"Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 535, note 2. Peyre opens the work thus: {:Armas, amors e cassa :me play quant se'n amassa :el coms, qui les mant√© . . .Riquer (1964), 535, with Catalan translation, footnote 2.  :Arms, amours, and hunting :please me when the gather :in the Count, who maintains them . . . } The count is named explicitly later (Febus, le coms). If the song is to be dated to the time when Peyre was consistently in or around Foix it would seem to pertain to the period 1344-57 or as late as 1373.Descalzo, 300. De Riquer has suggested that Peyre may be the Pere de Rius who was a fid√®le boutiller de notre ch√®re fille l'infante Jeanne (faithful butler of our dear daughter the infanta Joanna) under John I of Aragon, called The Hunter.The description is quoted from a document of 30 March 1386 by Descalzo, 300, citing Riquer (1954), 270. This Joanna (Juana de Daroca), the eldest daughter of John I, married Mathieu de Castelbon (on 24 March 1392), who had succeeded his uncle Gaston as count of Foix in 1391.

It was presented to the University in 1897 by William McEwan, brewer and politician, at a cost of ¬£115,000. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson was the architect. The McEwan Hall is a category A listed building. The design was begun in 1876 and was largely undertaken by George Mackie Watson whilst working in the offices of Robert Rowand Anderson (with the masterplan being by Rowand Anderson himself). It was built using stone from Prudham Quarry, Hexham in Northumberland. The exterior of the D-shaped hall was completed in 1894. The interior, finished in 1897, is built in Italian Renaissance style, and features mural decorations from the hand of William Mainwaring Palin. The central piece of art is a large painted work known as \\"The Temple of Fame\\" depicting a great number of philosophers and students. The McEwan Hall organ was built in 1897 by Robert Hope-Jones, and has been rebuilt and modified on various occasions afterwards. Another striking feature of the McEwan Hall is its large dome. On the inside of the dome is a biblical inscription: Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her and she shall bring thee to honour. (Proverbs 4:7). In 2015 the hall and Bristo Square closed for refurbishment and reopened in time for the July 2017 graduations at a projected cost of ¬£35 million. New heating, ventilation and lighting was integrated with the original interior and new seminar rooms created in the basement and below Bristo Square. One of the project's key aims was to provide easy access to all areas, including the second floor gallery. The McEwan Hall is used for graduations, lectures and public talks, some Edinburgh Festival Fringe events and organ recitals.

Photo: Steve Yager Dynamite Kablammo (also referred to as DK) is a sketch comedy group based in the San Fernando Valley, established in 2006 by Greg Kaczynski, Matt DeNoto, and Candida Rodriguez. Dana DeRuyck, Dane Biren and Meredith Rensa are also members. DeNoto and Kaczynski write the shows with DeRuyck occasionally contributing. DK's shows have a heavy technical side, requiring many visual and audio cues, and so they also maintain an audio/visual technician in the group, initially John Nobori, but replaced by Adam Neubauer in August 2007. Style & Influences Their style takes typical sketch comedy basics and keeps the time of each sketch down to a minimum. Sketches will run as short as 30 seconds to occasionally as long as four minutes, with an average of 20+ sketches being produced in an hour-long show, often showcasing \\"premises that splinter off in clever and unexpected directions.\\". LA Weekly, August 28, 2008 Their writing style precludes any and all topical humor, striving instead for absurdity, literary sketches, and cleverness. Every show contains at least one song written and composed by DeNoto. Among their influences, the members cite Monty Python, The Kids in the Hall, The State, The Simpsons, and Arrested Development. History and Acclaim Their first show premiered at Zombie Joe's Underground in North Hollywood on August 17, 2006. Even though Rodriguez is no longer with the group, as of August 2008, Dynamite Kablammo has put up 5 original shows, several \\"Best Of\\" shows, participated in the North Hollywood Arts festival, and attended the Rogue Festival in Fresno, CA. These shows have been critically acclaimed from such notable news outlets as the LA Weekly and Back Stage West. That initial show was nominated for three Artistic Director Achievement Awards in the North Hollywood arts district including Best Director, Best Ensemble (comedy), and Best Production (comedy). 2006 ADA's The original song from the first show, \\"Everybody Hates\\", was featured on the Huffington Post. \\"Everybody Hates\\" on the Huffington Post The second show, which opened January 18, 2007, was extended because of sold-out crowds. Before the third show was finished, Candida Rodriguez left the group and the acting industry behind completely. The following two shows were run with the remaining four members. In January 2008, the fourth show was mounted with a title, something Dynamite Kablammo had not done before. It was called \\"Are You Delicious?\\", received critical praise, BackstageWest Review LA Weekly Review and decent box office. In March 2008, Dynamite Kablammo went to the Rogue Festival in Fresno where they had a 6-show sold-out run. The show was also a critical success receiving glowing reviews Fresno Beehive Review Fresno Undercurrent Review Rogue Attendant Reviews In July 2008, they returned to having five members by recruiting Meredith Rensa. They also debuted their fifth original show, \\"You Will Most Likely Die\\", which also received critical acclaim from the Los Angeles press. LA Weekly Review of \\"You Will Most Likely Die\\" The Coming.org Review of \\"You Will Most Likely Die\\" After five acclaimed shows, Dynamite Kablammo hung up their pens and costumes and officially disbanded on January 1, 2009. Internal disagreements over funds and vision were central to the split accompanied by burn-out. Since the split, members have gone on to do remarkable solo work. Greg Kaczynski continues to work in theater around Los Angeles, he writes and teaches full-time. Matt DeNoto continues to write, working on screenplays and creating short comedic videos under the moniker Furious Molecules while still active with his band, Hollywood Trash. Candi Rodriguez has returned to acting and is very active in Los Angeles theater, working on solo projects; in the fall of 2008, she and Kaczynski collaborated on a critically acclaimed and financially successful clown show, \\"Nose Tales\\". Dana DeRuyck is very active in theater and film in the Los Angeles area, never having a moment to rest. Dane Biren is very active in Los Angeles theater, hoping to break into Broadway. After a period of being very active in local theater, Meredith Rensa is now raising a family. She intends on returning to acting when settled. In the spring of 2010, Matt DeNoto finished the lengthy project of compiling, editing, and organizing DVDs of the group's five original shows. On Saturday, March 27, 2010, he gathered - for the first time ever - every single member of the Dynamite Kablammo creative team (including Neubauer and Nobori) to record a commentary track for the DVD set. There are no current plans for Dynamite Kablammo to reunite. Other media Over the years, they have also produced several shorts which have garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers on sites like YouTube. In addition, the group is currently posting classic sketches taped during the live shows every week on their dedicated DK YouTube channel.

Name Charito's name does not appear in Ammianus Marcellinus, one of the main sources for the reign of her husband. The earliest source recording her name appears to be the \\"Chronographikon syntomon\\" of Nikephoros I of Constantinople. The earliest Latin source doing so was a translation of the chronographikon by Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Timothy Barnes considers her absence from the account of Ammianus to reflect her lack of political influence. Barnes notes that Ammianus does not name Albia Dominica, wife of Valens, whose influence was also limited.Timothy Barnes, \\"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\\" (1998), page 123 Family According to Ammianus and Zosimus, Charito was a daughter of Lucillianus. Lucillianus was a military commander situated in Sirmium during the late reign of Constantius II. He had served as a commander in a conflict with the Sassanid Empire in 350. He then served as comes domesticorum under Constantius Gallus.:Thomas Banchich , \\"Jovian (363-364 A.D.)\\" In 358 -359, Lucillianus and Procopius formed the second embassy sent by Constantius to Shapur II, negotiating terms of peace and returning without results.N. J. E. Austin and N. B. Rankov, \\"Exploratio:Military and Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople\\" (1998), page 224According to Ammianus:\\"On these very same days Prosper, Spectatus, and Eustathius, who had been sent as envoys to the Persians (as we have shown above), approached the king on his return to Ctesiphon, bearing letters and gifts from the emperor, and demanded peace with no change in the present status. Mindful of the emperor's instructions, they sacrificed no whit of the advantage and majesty of Rome, insisting that a treaty of friendship ought to be established with the condition that no move should be made to disturb the position of Armenia or Mesopotamia. Having therefore tarried there for a long time, since they saw that the king was most obstinately hardened against accepting peace, unless the dominion over those regions should be made over to him, they returned without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards Count Lucillianus was despatched, together with Procopius, at that time state secretary, to accomplish the self- same thing with like insistence on the conditions; the latter afterwards, bound as it were by a knot of stern necessity, rose in revolution. - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 1, Book 17, chapter 14. 1935 translation; \\"When our scouts had returned there, we found in the scabbard of a sword a parchment written in cipher, which had been brought to us by order of Procopius, who, as I said before, had previously been sent as an envoy to the Persians with Count Lucillianus. In this, with intentional obscurity, for fear that, if the bearers were taken and the meaning of the message known, most disastrous consequences would follow, he gave the following message: Now that the envoys of the Greeks have been sent far away and perhaps are to be killed, that aged king, not content with Hellespontus, will bridge the Granicus and the Rhyndacus and come to invade Asia with many nations. He is naturally passionate and very cruel, and he has as an instigator and abetter the successor of the former Roman emperor Hadrian;unless Greece takes heed, it is all over with her and her dirge chanted.\\" ; \\"This writing meant that the king of the Persians had crossed the rivers Anzaba and Tigris, and, urged on by Antoninus, aspired to the rule of the entire Orient. When it had been read, with the greatest difficulty because of its excessive ambiguity, a sagacious plan was formed.\\" - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 1, Book 18, chapter 6. 1935 translation Lucillianus later attempted to counter the advance of Julian and his forces against Constantius. He was defeated however and was dismissed from the Roman army when Julian rose to the throne.According to Ammianus:\\"Rumour, which with a thousand tongues, as men say, strangely exaggerates the truth, spread herself abroad with many reports throughout all Illyricum, saying that Julian, after overthrowing a great number of kings and nations in Gaul, was on the way with a numerous army and puffed up by sundry successes. Alarmed by this news, the pretorian prefect Taurus speedily retreated, as if avoiding a foreign enemy, and using the rapid changes of the public courier-service, he crossed the Julian Alps, at the same stroke taking away with him Florentius, who was also prefect. Nonetheless, Count Lucillianus, who then commanded the troops stationed in those regions, with headquarters at Sirmium, having some slight intelligence of Julian's move, gathered together such forces as regard for speedy action allowed to be summoned from the neighbouring stations and planned to resist him when he should arrive. But Julian, like a meteor or a blazing dart, hastened with winged speed to his goal; and when he had come to Bononea, distant nineteen miles from Sirmium, as the moon was waning and therefore making dark the greater part of the night, he unexpectedly landed, and at once sent Dagalaifus with a light-armed force to summon Lucillianus, and if he tried to resist, to bring him by force. The prefect was still asleep, and when he was awakened by the noise and confusion and saw himself surrounded by a ring of strangers, he understood the situation and, overcome with fear on hearing the emperor's name, obeyed his command, though most unwillingly. So the commander of the cavalry, just now so haughty and self-confident, following another's behest, was set upon the first horse that could be found and brought before the emperor like a base captive, scarcely keeping his wits through terror. But when at first sight of Julian he saw that the opportunity was given him of bowing down to the purple, taking heart at last and no longer in fear for his life, he said: \\"Incautiously and rashly, my Emperor, you have trusted yourself with a few followers to another's territory.\\" To which Julian replied with a bitter smile: \\"Reserve these wise words for Constantius, for I have offered you the emblem of imperial majesty, not as to a counsellor, but that you might cease to fear.\\" - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 21, chapter 9. 1940 translation Ammianus and Zosimus give two slightly different accounts on the role of the imperial father-in-law in the brief reign of Jovian. Lucillianus was reinstated and received orders to move to Mediolanum. In secret, Jovianus also asked him to \\"take with him some men selected for their tried vigour and loyalty, with the view of making use of their support as the condition of affairs might suggest\\".\\"Procopius, a state-secretary, and the military tribune Memoridus were sent to the lands of Illyricum and Gaul, to announce the death of Julianus, and the elevation of Jovian (after Julianus's decease) to Augustan rank. To them the emperor had also given instructions to hand his father-in‚Äëlaw Lucillianus, who after his dismissal from the army had retired to a life of leisure and was then living at Sirmium, the commission as commander of the cavalry and infantry which he had delivered to them, and urge him to hasten to Milan, in order to attend to any difficulties there, or if (as was now rather to be feared) any new dangers should arise, to resist them. To these instructions the emperor had added a secret letter, in which he also directed Lucillianus to take with him some men selected for their tried vigour and loyalty, with the view of making use of their support as the condition of affairs might suggest. And he took the prudent step of appointing Malarichus, who also was even then living in Italy in a private capacity, as successor to Jovinus, commander of the cavalry in Gaul, sending him the insignia of that rank. Thereby he aimed at a double advantage: first, in getting rid of a general of distinguished service and therefore an object of suspicion; and, second, the hope that a man of slight expectations, when raised to a high rank, might show great zeal in supporting the position of his benefactor, which was still uncertain. Also the men who were commissioned to carry out these plans were ordered to set the course of events in a favourable light, and wherever they went, to agree with each other in spreading the report that the Parthian campaign had been brought to a successful end. They were to hasten their journey by adding night to day, to put into the hands of the governors and the military commanders of the provinces the messages of the new emperor, to secretly sound the sentiments of all of them, and to return steadily with their replies, in order that as soon as it was learned how matters stood in the distant provinces, timely and careful plans might be made for safeguarding the imperial power.\\" - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 25, chapter 8. 1940 translation The return of Lucillianus to action would result in his death sometime later. He was killed by his own men after a false rumour indicated that Julian was still alive.\\"After this the emperor left Tarsus, and making long marches arrived at Tyana, a town of Cappadocia, where on their return the secretary Procopius and the tribune Memoridus met him. They gave him an account of their missions, beginning (as order demanded) with the entry of Lucillianus with the tribunes Seniauchus and Valentinianus, whom he had taken with him, into Mediolanum; but on learning that Malarichus had refused to accept the position he had gone at full speed to Rheims. Then, as if that nation were in profound peace, he ran off the track (as the saying is), and quite out of season, since everything was not yet secure, devoted his attention to examining the accounts of a former actuary. This man, being conscious of deceit and wrongdoing, fled for refuge to the army and falsely asserted that Julianus was still alive and that a man of no distinction had raised a rebellion; in consequence of his falsehoods a veritable storm broke out among the soldiery, and Lucillianus and Seniauchus were killed. For Valentinianus, who was shortly afterwards emperor, in terror and not knowing where to turn, was safely gotten out of the way by Primitivus, his guest-friend. This sad news was followed by another message, this time a happy one, namely, that soldiers sent by Jovinus, heads of the divisions, as camp parlance termed them, were on the way, reporting that the Gallic army embraced with favour the rule of Jovian - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 25, chapter 10. 1940 translation According to Zosimus, Lucillianus was murdered for being the bearer of the bad news about the death of Julian.\\"Jovian now turning his attention to the affairs of government, made various arrangements, and sent Lucilianus his father-in-law, Procopius, and Valentinian, who was afterwards emperor, to the armies in Pannonia, to inform them of the death of Julian, and of his being chosen emperor. The Batavians who were at Sirmium, and were left there for its protection, as soon as they received the news, put to death Lucilianus who brought such unwelcome intelligence, without regard to his relationship to the emperor. Such was the respect they had to Jovian's relations, that Valentinian himself only escaped from the death they intended to inflict on him.\\" Zosimus, New History, Book 3. 1814 translation. The two accounts differ in the location of the death, Rheims or Sirmium, and on which units were responsible. Ammianus leaves it vague while Zosimus points at specific units.Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Empress Charito married Jovian, a son of Varronianus. Her father-in-law was tribune of the Jovians and comes domesticorum. Varronianus retired into private life during the reign of Julian. Jovian had also pursued a military career, serving as primicerius domesticorum under Julian. They had at least one son, also named Varronianus. Philostorgius claims that Varronianus was one of two sons. The other son is not named.Philostorgius: Church History; translation by Philip R. Amidon. Leiden ; Boston : Brill, 2007 ; Book 8, chapter 8, p. 114 However this brief mention is the only source mentioning or suggesting the existence of a second son.Noel Emmanuel Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 ; p. 20 On 26 June 363, Julian was mortally wounded in the Battle of Samarra. He died a few hours following the end of the conflict. He was childless and had never designated an heir.Walter E. Roberts and Michael DiMaio, Jr,\\" On 27 June, the remaining officers of the campaign proceeded to elect a new emperor, selecting Jovian for unclear reasons. Charito became the new empress.According to Ammianus: \\"It was said that his father, Varronianus, learned what would happen long beforehand from the suggestion of a dream, and trusted the information to two of his confidential friends, adding the remark that the consular robe would be conferred also on himself. But although one prophecy was fulfilled, he could not attain the other prediction. For after learning of the elevation of his son, he was overtaken by death before seeing him again. And since it was foretold to the old man in a dream that the highest magistracy awaited one of that name, his grandson Varronianus, then still a child, was ... made consul together with his father Jovianus.\\" - The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 25, chapter 10. 1940 translation Jovianus and the younger Varronianus served as Roman Consuls in 364. The Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century by Henry Wace notes Charito and their son had joined the Emperor by the end of 363, a fact that can be determined by a passage of Themistius. But Joannes Zonaras reports that Charito and Jovian did not met each other during his reign, a possible error according to the Dictionary.Thomas Banchich , Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies. by Henry Wace, entry \\"Jovian\\"Ammianus records:\\"When the emperor had entered Ancyra, after the necessary arrangements for his procession had been made, so far as the conditions allowed, he assumed the consulship, taking as his colleague in the office his son Varronianus, who was still a small child; and his crying and obstinate resistance to being carried, as usual, on the curule chair, were an omen of what presently occurred.\\"The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 25, chapter 10. 1940 translation. The historian interprets the crying consul as an ill omen, preceding the early death of Jovian. On 17 February 364, Jovian died at Dadastana and various accounts have survived debating the manner of his death. Ammianus, for instance, compares his death with that of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus and seems to have suspected murder. Eutropius reports that Jovian \\"by the kindness of the emperors that succeeded him, was enrolled among the gods\\".Eutropius, Abridgement of Roman History, Book 10. 1853 translation Which indicates the practice of the Imperial cult continued at least to this point in time. Zonaras reports both Jovian and Charito buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, Constantinople. Widow The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon reports that: The reference to Varronianus being half-blind comes from the \\"Homilies on Philippians\\" by John Chrysostom. \\"Another again, his successor, was destroyed by noxious drugs, and his cup was to him no longer drink, but death. And his son had an eye put out, from fear of what was to follow, though he had done no wrong.\\" Louis-S√©bastien Le Nain de Tillemont was the first to identify the poisoned emperor with Jovian and the son with Varronianus. Gibbon and others have followed this interpretation. Tillemont assumed that Varronianus was eventually executed but there is no ancient or medieval text supporting the notion.John Chrysostom, \\"Homilies on Philippians.\\", 19th century translation, edited by Philip Schaff (1819 - 1913) The reference to the fate of Charito comes from the \\"Letter to a Young Widow\\" by John Chrysostom, written c. 380. The original passage is quite vague in not actually naming the emperors or empresses mentioned. The interpretation given by Gibbon and others identifies the two emperors who died of natural causes with Constantine I and Constantius II. The one slain by a usurper was Constans, assassinated by orders of rival emperor Magnentius. The one killed in battle is thought to be Constantine II. The one assassinated by his guards was Jovian, since Chrysostom expressed the same belief in another of his texts. The one killed by the man who elevated him to the purple was Constantius Gallus, created Caesar by Constantius II and later executed by orders of the same emperor. The empress trembling for the life of her son is thought to be Charito. The one returning from exile is tentatively identified with Marina Severa, first wife of Valentinian I and mother of Gratian.

He is a Catholic martyr. Life He was the third son of Richard Ashton of Croston, in Lancashire. In 1585 he had gone to serve in the Low Countries under the Earl of Leicester against the Spanish. Sir William Stanley having been placed on guard over the town of Deventer, which had revolted from the Spaniards, he, with the assistance of Ashton, gave the town back to Spain and went over to their side (29 January 1587). Cardinal William Allen published a \\"Defence\\" of this act in the form of a letter addressed to one \\"R.A.\\". Stanley next entrusted to Ashton the task of bringing over his wife from Ireland, but she was already under arrest. At the close of the year 1587 he returned to England and was apprehended in Kent with a marriage dispensation; Richard Challoner says it was a papal dispensation to marry his second cousin. In January, 1588, he was in the Tower of London. Ill towards the close of the year, he was transferred to easier confinement in the Marshalsea. From this he managed to escape and fled to his brothers in Lancashire. He was arrested later, at Shields (modern North Shields or South Shields, the historian does not specify which) near Newcastle, while trying to escape overseas. Transferred to Durham and York, he was tried and sentenced at Canterbury. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered; his indictment is not preserved.

The present Catholic community in the country finds its roots in the ministry of the Missionary Society of St. Joseph (Mill Hill Missionaries) They started schools all throughout Miri, starting with Good Shepherd School, at Claude Town (or present day Marudi). After the Vicariate of Miri was established and, in the following year, Father Anthony D. Galvin (who was a Mill Hill Father himself) was consecrated the first bishop of the Miri Vicariate. He was ordained by Pope John XXIII in Rome on 5 May 1960. Approximately 6 years later, on 2 January 1966, Father Anthony Lee (who was the first priest from Miri at that time) was ordained. Pope Paul VI then established a new Church province in East Malaysia on 31 May 1976, and Miri Vicariate was raised to the level of a Diocese. On 20 May 1977, Pope Paul VI appointed Father Anthony Lee as the first bishop of the Diocese of Miri, and he was ordained bishop in St. Joseph's Cathedral, Miri, on 20 Nov and the Diocese of Miri was officially proclaimed on the same day.

Its 40-kilometre trail system provides a connection to the Bruce Trail. The area contains a trailhead of the Hamilton-Brantford-Cambridge Trails, Canada's first fully developed interurban multi-use trail system, which is a part of the Trans Canada Trail. Landform The origins of the Dundas Valley, the main feature of the area, date back to the pre-glacial times, when the Niagara Escarpment was deeply incised by erosion. The Wisconsin Glaciation furthered the erosion processes and resulted in deposition of glacial and glaciolacustrine sediments, forming the hummocky kame and kettle topography of the present. Cultural heritage=Sulphur Springs Hotel A sulphurous spring found in the area was the site of the Sulphur Springs Hotel built during the late 1880s. As sulphur was believed to possess wondrous curative powers, the hotel's mineral spa was a very popular summertime destination. The hotel closed down in 1910 after it was ravaged by two fires. The spring flows from a fountain first built in 1820 from cast iron. In 1850, it was replaced by a cement fountain. Having crumbled, it was restored in 1972. The Hermitage A magnificent stone mansion was built in 1855 by George Gordon Browne Leith, an immigrant from Scotland. Construction materials were obtained locally. Bricks originated from the Dundas Valley clay; limestone was quarried at the Credit River valley. The Hermitage burned down in 1934. After that, Leith's daughter built a much smaller house among the ruins and lived there until her death in 1942. To prevent further deterioration, the ruins were stabilized using wooden braces.

Adjacent to it is a remnant of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway track, with a 1929 executive coach car and a 1931 baggage car donated by the Canadian Pacific Railway.

It is the principal port for London, as well as being the main United Kingdom port for handling the importation of paper. There are extensive facilities for containers, grain, and other bulk cargoes. There are also facilities for the importation of cars. It forms part of the wider Port of London. Geography The Port of Tilbury lies on the north shore of the River Thames, downstream of London Bridge, at a point where the river makes a loop southwards, and where its width narrows to . The loop is part of the Thames lower reaches: within the meander was a huge area of marshland. Gravesend on the opposite shore had long been a port of entry for shipping, all of which had used the river itself for loading and unloading of cargo and passengers. There was also a naval dockyard at Northfleet at the mouth of the Ebbsfleet River. The new deepwater docks were an extension of all that maritime activity. The original docks consisted of a tidal basin on Gravesend Reach opposite Northfleet, connected by a lock to a main dock with three side branches named East, Central and West Branch docks. Between the tidal basin and Main Dock were two dry docks. History=Construction The original docks of London, all built close to the City, were opened in stages by what was to become the East and West India Docks Company (E&WIDC;) at the beginning of the 19th century. With the coming of the railways and increasing ship size, location close to the centre of London became less important than access to deep water, unrestricted sites and reduction in time spent travelling up the winding Thames. The company had long been in competition with their rival, the London and St Katherine Dock Company (L&StKDC;), and had been doing all it could to dominate it. The opening of the Royal Albert Dock by the L&StKDC;, with its deepwater quayage, in 1880 had given access to the Thames at Gallions Reach, by river below London Bridge and downstream of the then principal London docks. The E&WIDC; were forced to retaliate.The rivalry between the two companies In 1882, an Act of Parliament allowed the latter to construct the docks at Tilbury; the work, which was undertaken by Lucas and Aird, began a fortnight later, and the first vessel to enter the docks was on 17 April 1886. This was the Glenfruin carrying the official party for the opening ceremony. The opening of the dock took place at the beginning of the steamship era, and its location soon proved to be the correct one.Timeline of Tilbury Docks A map of the town from 1946 Ship discharging at Tilbury Grain Terminal Docks expansion In 1909 Tilbury, along with the upstream docks, became part of the newly established Port of London Authority (PLA). In 1921, and again in 1929, the PLA carried out major improvements. These included a new lock long and wide, linking the docks directly to the Thames to the west at Northfleet Hope, and a third dry dock, long and wide. These works were carried out by Sir Robert McAlpine. During the 1960s, at the time when the upstream docks were closing, the PLA further extended the Tilbury dock facilities. Between 1963 and 1966 a huge fourth branch dock, running north from Main Dock for nearly , was constructed. The tidal basin was closed and eventually filled in. In 1969 a ¬£6 million riverside grain terminal on Northfleet Hope was brought into use. The PLA funded a new ¬£30 million container port which opened in 1967. Labour issues prevented full service from starting until April 1970, although United States Lines reached an agreement with the union to begin service in 1968. Near the Dockmaster's office, on New Lock, is a memorial to Captain Peter de Neumann, GM, who was killed there in an accident on 16 September 1972. In 1978, a deep water riverside berth was opened for large container ships on reclaimed land at Northfleet Hope. In 1992 the port was privatised and became part of the Forth Ports organisation, the PLA retaining the role of managing the tidal Thames. Rolf Harris visited the Docks in 2004 during a TV episode of Rolf on Art, when he recreated J. M. W. Turner's famous painting The Fighting Temeraire. On 25 January 2012 Otter Ports Holdings Ltd, owner of Forth Ports, acquired from DP World Limited (\\"DP World\\") and Associated British Ports Ltd (\\"AB Ports\\") the 67% ownership of Tilbury Container Services Ltd (\\"TCS\\") not already owned by Forth Ports in a cash transaction. Forth Ports had been a one third shareholder in TCS since 1998 along with partners DP World and AB Ports. TCS is located within the Port of Tilbury, which is wholly owned by Forth Ports.Acquisition of Tilbury Container Terminal In October 2019, 39 people were found dead in a truck at nearby Grays. The truck was moved to the Port of Tilbury the next day, so that more investigations could be undertaken. After that, the bodies were moved to Broomfield Hospital. Port of Tilbury recently announced a joint development with Tarmac, a partnership which will see the UK's largest construction materials aggregates terminal (CMAT) built on the 152-acre site of Tilbury2, the joint development of the CMAT is expected to see most operations to be established by the end of 2020. London Cruise Terminal Tilbury International Cruise Terminal, viewed from the water in 2015 One of the shipping lines using the docks was the P&O.; Tilbury became the only port in the PLA to serve ocean liners, when, in 1916, it opened berths specifically for the P&O; within the dock complex. With the need for expanded facilities, a large new passenger landing stage was constructed in the Thames jointly by the PLA and the London Midland and Scottish Railway, with rail connections. It was opened in May 1930 by Ramsay MacDonald. Tilbury operated as London's passenger liner passenger terminal until the 1960s. For many people Tilbury was their point of emigration to Australia under an assisted passage scheme established and operated by the Australian Government. The 'Ten Pound Poms' as they were known in Australia, embarked on to ships such as RMS Mooltan and set off for a new life. Tilbury was also a port of entry for many immigrants; among them being a large group of West Indians on in 1948.UK, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878‚Äì1960. Ancestry.com in association with The National Archives. The passenger landing stage was reopened by the Port of Tilbury group, as the London Cruise Terminal in 1995. The historic passenger terminal building has been rebuilt and refurbished over the subsequent years and is now called the \\"London International Cruise Terminal\\". The old station building (no longer served by a railway connection) has been refurbished to house a new luggage retrieval hall. Other port activities The Port of Tilbury Police, among the oldest of such forces in the UK, are responsible for the security of the Port. The port is also a base of operations of Thurrock Sea Cadets, who operate out of TS Iveston (a Coniston class former minesweeper).Navy News, 2004 Iveston‚Äôs Indian Summer. Seafarers welfare charity, Apostleship of the Sea, which provides practical and pastoral support to seafarers, has a port chaplain based at the port. Tilbury Docks in film The Docks stood in for Venetian waterways during the boat-chase scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade; and scenes from Batman Begins were also filmed there, as was a scene in the 2004 Jude Law film Alfie. The Docks were also used in 1975 as the setting of John Wayne's smuggler-busting operation in Brannigan. In Paddington (2014), the scene where Paddington arrives on boat was filmed at the Port of Tilbury.

Location  The village is located in central Bohemia, 4 kilometres from Kladno, the local administrative capital. It is 409 metres above sea level. It is situated on the old route to Eger (part of the old Kingdom of Bohemia, known now in Czech as Cheb), and today is linked by road to Karlovy Vary (German: Karlsbad). The village once contained nine ponds, but today only one remains, on the village green. Origin of village name Until 1935, the village was regarded as two separate settlements, Mala Dobr√° and Velk√° Dobr√°; these had earlier been called Horejsi and Dolejsi Dobra. During the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939‚Äì1945) the village was called Gro√ü Dobray. In English, velk√° means \\"large\\" or great and dobr√° means good; the name of the village refers to \\"good water\\" or \\"fertile land\\". Demographics As of 2008, the population of Velk√° Dobr√° is 1033. History There is evidence of human inhabitation in the region of Velk√° Dobr√° since prehistory. A late 19th century archaeological investigation led by Josef Szombathy discovered a large middle Bronze Age (ca.1200 BCE) grave site near the village in the forest of Hora. A monument constructed over 50 years stood over the largest grave mound. Around sixty graves were investigated, yielding bronze weapons, tools and utensils, several of which were sent for display at museums in Prague and Vienna. The first written records of Dobr√° date from 1328, when two strongholds existed in the area, the lower at the site of the modern school on J.A. Komensky Square and the upper stronghold (still standing in 2008) at the junction of the Kladno and Karlovy Vary roads. During the Hussite Wars the settlement, located on an important trade route through Bohemia, was badly damaged. In 1548 Mal√° Dobr√° had 8 settlers and Velk√° Dobr√° nine. The village sustained extensive damage during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). Protestant troops under Fridrich Falck√Ω marched through Dobr√° from Rakovn√≠k on August 26, 1619, and looted the village. During the war many residents were slaughtered, died of epidemic disease, or fled into the forests. In 1662, reports stated that six out of 14 farms at the settlement were still empty, and the lower village stronghold of Zdarsti ze Zdaru, used for accommodation during the 16th century, had been turned into farm land. In 1688, though, the former upper defensive stronghold was converted into a granary, suggesting a recovering population. This building is still standing in 2008. Around 1753 the village erected a statue to Jan Nepomucky, followed by a church in 1765. The church was remodelled to its current form in 1816 and dedicated by Antonin Hertzok z Adlersbergu, dean of Smeƒçno, on October 12, 1817. Until the mid-19th century the Kladno region was largely agricultural, and most Velk√° Dobr√° residents were farmers. In 1843 Mal√° Dobr√°'s population numbered 326 persons in 42 households, with another 291 persons in 36 households (average eight residents per household) at Velk√° Dobr√°. New employment opportunities emerged when the first black coal mines were opened in the Kladno region, and expanded when Adalbert Works, a steelworks and predecessor of the modern company Poldi, opened at Kladno. The population rose by 115 between 1843 and 1857, and reached a total of 748 across Mal√° and Velk√° Dobr√° in 1870, despite a cholera outbreak that killed 30 in 1866, following the stationing of Prussian troops at the village during the Austro-Prussian War. In 1929 the Unho≈°≈• administrative district was abolished and Mal√° and Velk√° Dobr√° became part of Kladno district. Notable inhabitants V√°clav Nosek, a founder of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and StB (communist secret police) and Minister of the Interior during the communist putsch in February 1948, was born at 161 Carlsbad Street.

Hill (born September 26, 1967) is a Texas entrepreneur and business leader. Hill gained his reputation as entrepreneur after spearheading the use of semi trailers that had been converted to transport, as well as dry, agricultural products. Hill has been honored as Republican Business Leader of the Year by the National Republican Congressional Committee, named Distinguished Alumni of the Year by Dallas Christian School and by appointment of Governor Rick Perry serves on the Texas Emerging Technology Fund (TETF). In 2011, Hill formed a NASCAR team, Randy Hill Racing.  Early life  Hill was born in Dallas, TX and raised in the Dallas areas of Oak Cliff and Garland. He graduated from Dallas Christian High School in 1986 and enrolled in Abilene Christian University. While attending ACU, he played on the football team as a defensive tackle. He graduated with a degree in Journalism/Mass Comm.  Career  Hill learned the inner workings of the semi trailer trade as a sales representative for Transport International Pool, a subsidiary of GE Capital. The company leased and sold trailers that were marketed exclusively as a mode of transport. In 1995, Hill left TIP to start Advanced Trailer. In the mid-1990s, retailers began seeking large storage spaces for seasonal increases in inventories. Knowing that GE Capital and Trans America retired trailers after their use as transport, Hill began purchasing the retired trailers and converting them to storage trailers. Advanced Trailer was also amongst the first to convert ocean containers from steam ship lines for public use as storage facilities. The ability to recognize potential in what other industries regarded as cast offs allowed Hill to bring a break through concept to practical application. In 1996, researchers at Texas Tech University in Lubbock developed a more efficient method of transporting and drying peanuts. For generations, the important process of drying peanuts after harvest was done in small steel wagons called \\"buggies\\" that were often pulled by farm trucks. The idea of using semi trailers expanded after Advanced Trailer sold the first trailers for modification to farmers in West Texas. Advanced Trailer filled orders from West Texas to the Southeastern United States, eventually opening a facility in Vienna, GA. Since designing the drying trailer, Advanced Trailer has filled orders in eleven states and four countries. Hill has continued to develop possibilities beyond current usage of the trailers. In addition to peanuts, the trailers have been used to dry grass seed, hay, almonds, and macadamia nuts. His most recent work has been with heavy haul transportation and large equipment trailers used in oil and gas exploration, wind energy, and military use. Hill's current patents include provisions for drying key products in the development of biofuel; biomass energy generation in western Texas is an issue Hill is attempting to spearhead.  Personal life  Randy, his wife Jane√©, and son Randal Harrell Hill reside in Fort Worth, TX. Randy has three daughters, Miranda, Magee and Macie, who live in Abilene. Randy has a lifelong interest in ranching and enjoys hunting and fishing in West Texas in his spare time. He is a member of the ACU Letterman's Association. Randy enjoys numerous philanthropic efforts, including significant participation in community projects at Abilene Christian University and Dallas Christian School. Hill also started Randy Hill Racing, a racing team competing in the ARCA Racing Series and NASCAR Nationwide Series, in 2011.

There is anecdotal evidience that St. Thomas the Apostle passed through Taxila (in this diocese) on his way to India in the first century AD. The diocese has a long history, as it was originally erected in 1887, as the Apostolic Prefecture of Kafiristan and Kashmir. The prefecture was erected from the Diocese of Lahore. In 1947, the Apostolic prefecture was elevated to a full diocese, and renamed the diocese of Rawalpindi. In 1952, Kashmir was lost to the diocese, and a new diocese created from territory in Rawalpindi and Lahore to create the Apostolic Prefecture of Kashmir and Jammu. In 1979, the name was changed to the Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lahore. It comprises the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Azad Kashmir and the Northern Areas, Gujrat District of Gujranwala Division, the Rawalpindi Division, and the Sargodha Division. At the time there were only 16 priests to minister to the Catholics in the diocese. The principal church of the diocese is the St. Joseph's Cathedral, Rawalpindi. The Diocese has a population of about 35 million, including 250,000 Catholics many of whom are committed to education (through its more than 70 schools like the Catholic Public High School in Sangota, in the Swat Valley), training institutes and hospitals. In 1920 the Medical Mission Sisters set up the 16-bed St. Catherine's Hospital in Rawalpindi under the auspices of the Diocese. The hospital evolved into the Holy Family Hospital and continued to operate under the Diocese until 1977. In that year the diocese was no longer able to bear the financial burden of running the hospital and handed it over to the Government of Punjab.

As the importance of the industrial heritage of Victoria and Australia has become more prominent, the Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club was established by volunteers to enable like-minded volunteers to preserve this part of our history. The club was established in Melbourne over 45 years ago and is located at 1200 Ferntree Gully Rd Scoresby, Victoria, Australia. On site there is an extensive collection of Mobile Steam, Stationary Steam Engines, Stationary IC Engines, Diesel engines, Diesel Generator sets, Tractors and other mobile machinery.Members Handbook, 3rd edition - Aug 2008 History Formed in 1963, the Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club has been at its present 6¬Ω hectare site in Scoresby, Victoria since 1986 when it moved from land leased from Beamish Heavy Haulage at Wantirna. The site was originally a depot used for the tunnelling of the main trunk sewer and was a desolate wasteland when the club took it over. Since occupation, the site has been developed with landscaping, tree planting, installation of the rail track, construction of the 9 sheds and toilet block and a man made lake.Members Handbook, p.5 National Steam Centre display The engines on display at the National Steam Centre represent many years of collection and restoration efforts by the members. In addition to the engines owned by the club, a number of members' privately owned engines are kept at the centre. A particular effort has gone in to ensure Australian steam and industrial heritage is preserved for Australians, in Australia, rather than allowing local heritage to be shipped overseas. Run days Many of the engines on display are operated on the last Sunday of each month. This unique opportunity allows visitors to see many of the steam and diesel stationary engines running, including several steam Traction engines, steam rollers and tractors operating in the central arena. Rides aboard the miniature steam railway are a highlight! Annual rally The club's annual rally, known as the Scoresby Steamfest is held on the long weekend in March each year when many of the beautifully restored engines are exhibited and operated. Particular emphasis is placed on exhibiting engines as they were intended to be used, driving industrial or agricultural implements for example. Exhibits from many other associated clubs and historic machinery associations are also displayed and operated, as well as that from private collectors and enthusiasts. More recently, exhibits at the Scoresby Steamfest have grown to encompass many other hobbies and collections, including model and experimental engineering and crafting, collections of antique engineering artifacts and tools, oil lamps, mechanical music, and other items from bygone eras. Railway The miniature railway operates every Sunday, weather permitting, from 11 am to 4 pm, except for the Christmas - New Year period. The track runs for about 1 km around the perimeter of the site. On the trip you pass the lake complete with numerous ducks and other water birds, you see the cattle grazing on the nearby farmland and you view some of the museum machinery around the track. The line is only set up to run a single train at any one time. On the last Sunday of the month the train is pulled by a 4-4-2 steam locomotive if available. On other Sundays the diesel outline engine is used. The grounds have shady trees, picnic tables and a gas barbecue for a picnic outing. There is no charge for admission to the grounds except for some special events like the annual rally.

Focolare is a Catholic lay movement whose name means \\"family hearth\\" present in more than 180 countries and involving more than 2 million people. The movement was recognized by the Catholic Church under the official name \\"Work of Mary.\\" The St. Thomas the Apostle Minor Seminary is the preparatory seminary of the diocese. Joseph Coutts, appointed in 1998, was bishop until June 2012, when he was named Archbishop of Karachi.UCANews 25 January 2012 Pope Francis created Coutts a cardinal priest in the consistory of 28 June 2018, assigning him the titular church of San Bonaventura da Bagnoregio. The biggest Catholic village in Pakistan, Khushpur, is also located in the diocese. It celebrated its centenary in 2001. Father Parvez Emmanuel was the parish priest at the time. The village has about 7,000 Catholics and produced one bishop, John Joseph of Faisalabad, 20 priests and more than 100 nuns.

Tingachhia used to be a village but it is now part of Katihar municipality, within Ward No 44 The town is at a low elevation, and the landscape is crossed by dried streams. A natural drainage near the village is the Kathotia, which is dirty from sewage from the town. The Kosi canal passes near the village. Formerly much of the area was covered with Mango & Litchi orchards. History Tingachhia is a very old settlement located on the trade route from the Bihar plateau to Nepal. The origin of the name \\"Tingachhia\\" means the place with three trees. The traders used to rest in the shade of these three trees and hence the name. Initially the area was lightly populated and most of the land owned by Zamindars were used for cultivation. With the increase in population the locality grew. A jute mill was set up which is now known as Purana Jute Mill. At the same time there was a match factory, but it has since been closed down as the result of multiple fires. Tingachhia has been a trade centre for raw jute. In the 1960s and 1970s the Jute gola of Mangal Chand Jain supplied jute to the mills of Katihar and Calcutta. The Government of Bihar set up two farms for the development of agriculture. One of the farms, known as Rajendra Jute Research Institute, is doing pioneering work in the area of jute cultivation. Under the aegis of the Government of India the Bihar government set up a Krishi Bazar Samiti (Agriculture Market Yard) for the marketing of agricultural produce in 1974. This samiti is the centre for trading of agricultural products for the entire Katihar district. The godowns and offices of State Food Corporation and Central Ware Housing Corporation are located in the Bazar Samiti premises. There is an office and centre of the Jute Corporation of India for the sale and purchase of jute. Economy The area is dotted with rice mills and large godowns. The people are mostly engaged in trading and transportation activities. A sizeable segment of the population is employed in education as there are schools and coaching institutes in the area. Many people are government employees. The Bazar Samiti is a big trading centre for paddy and jute. The town is also a center for trading in milk-giving livestock. High yielding animals are brought here from other parts of India and sold to the people of adjoining areas, including the province of West Bengal. The cost of living is cheap, particularly for fod. One can find fresh vegetables, fish, and pure milk at a very low prices. There are two firms which are engaged in manufacturing of agricultural equipments. These agricultural equipments are supplied to West Bengal and Nepal. People and culture Most of the people in the area are settlers from outside commensurate with the industrialization and trading activities. The earliest prominent employer was the jute mills. People mostly speak Angika and Hindi; however, at home they speak their own language like Bhojpuri, Mithili, etc. There is a sizable migrant population from Myanmar settled in the Burma Colony. Some refugees from Bangladesh have also chosen Tingachhia as their home. Communication Tingachhia is located at the southern fringe of Katihar Town. The main road is a highway that goes to Manihari. This highway bisects Tingachhia in an east‚Äìwest direction, and is a very busy life line of the rural area. Travelers use this road to get from Manihari to Kaanwar during the month of Shravan to offer Ganga-Jal to Lord Shiva. During all pious occasions requiring bathing in the river Ganges this road becomes busier. The locality is three kilometers southeast of the Katihar railway station. Rickshaws and hired cars and nowadays three wheelers, too, are also available at the railway station. The nearest commercial airport is Bagdogra. Telecommunication facilities are available in the locality. One can choose from a fixed line via BSNL or mobile cell services of all the operators.

The Grade I listed Gothic Revival church was designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. It has a spire height of 61m / 200 ft and is by far the tallest building in the town.  History =Origins The history of St. Giles' begins with the establishment of a Catholic mission in Cheadle by Fr. William Wareing, a future Bishop of Northampton. He was an assistant to Fr. Thomas Baddeley at Cresswell, and in the early 1820s he opened a small chapel in a private house in Charles Street, Cheadle. Among those attending Mass there was Charles, Earl of Shrewsbury, when he stayed at Alton Abbey without his chaplain. As Fr. Wareings' efforts bore fruit, the room became inadequate for the growing numbers, and Lord Shrewsbury asked him to look for larger premises. Eventually he obtained, on the Earl's behalf, a building about in length which had been built as an armory for the local militia during the Napoleonic Wars, and the adjoining adjutant's house. This was converted into the new chapel, and the first resident priest was Fr. James Jeffries, appointed in 1827. In the same year the fifteenth Earl of Shrewsbury died and was succeeded by his nephew, John Talbot, as the sixteenth Earl. Earl John made Alton Abbey his principal residence and renamed it \\"Alton Towers\\". The Earl was zealous in promoting the Catholic cause following the 1829 Emancipation Act, and it was he who first brought Pugin to North Staffordshire in the autumn of 1837, initially as an architect and interior designer at the Towers. Convinced that Pugin was the greatest acquisition the Church had made for some time, the Earl soon resolved that he would make financial contributions only to churches designed by Pugin and built under his supervision. As the Earl's architect, Pugin paid frequent, and sometimes lengthy visits, to Alton Towers - a convenient base from which to supervise progress on his various buildings in the Midlands. St. Giles' was vastly different in concept and design from the mean-looking chapels - such as the converted armoury in Cheadle - in which Catholics were accustomed to worship under the Toleration Act; different too from the fashionable city chapels such as that in Warwick Street where the Talbot family worshipped when in London. Both kinds were, according to Pugin, wholly unfit for their purpose. Gathering ideas At St. Giles' Pugin was able to further develop ideas from the recently completed St. Mary's Catholic Church, Uttoxeter, through the assistance of generous funding promised by Lord Shrewsbury. The site for St. Giles' was marked out by Pugin in 1841 and the church was aligned in such a way to obtain the best possible effect from the street. This meant modifying the traditional east‚Äìwest alignment and placing the west end close to the frontage of Bank Street to allow the full height of the tower and spire to be seen from the junction of Cross Street and High Street, where the remains of the medieval market cross still stand. Pugin also referred to St. Giles' as \\"my consolation in all afflictions\\", and there is no doubt that the freedom from restrictions, the resources available to him at Cheadle and the enthusiastic support of Lord Shrewsbury, compensated somewhat for the professional and personal disappointments he encountered elsewhere. He had suffered under the constraints imposed by church-building committees, the indifference of many clergy to his dreams of a Gothic England and the death in 1844 of his second wife, Louisa. That St. Giles' increased in size and splendour as the work progressed was not just the result of Pugin's own enthusiasm for the project and his ability to prise additional sums of money from a reluctant patron. Lord Shrewsbury was himself committed to the promotion of the revived Gothic as a means of winning souls, and several of the alterations and additions at Cheadle were suggested by the earl himself. The infinite care which Pugin took over St. Giles' is reflected in his wide- ranging search for what he called \\"authorities\\" (medieval precedents), for what he proposed. In 1840 he made a tour of what he called \\"the very cream\\" of Norfolk churches, in the course of preparation of his designs for Cheadle, drawing details of mouldings, tracery patterns and canopy work. His sketchbook from the tour survives in the Victoria and Albert Museum. East Anglican porches were Pugin's source of inspiration for the stone-vaulted south porch of St. Giles'. He studied surviving rood-screens in Norfolk, and the one at Castle Acre appears to have been particular favoured in his preparations for the Cheadle screen. Not all of Pugin's authorities were English, however. Gothic was an international language with local and national dialects. On a visit to Antwerp in 1843 Pugin hoped to find \\"glorious details for the Cheadle windows\\" and \\"the most beautiful authorities for painted details at Cheadle above all\\". In May 1844 Pugin visited the recently restored Sainte-Chapelle in √éle de la Cit√©, Paris, a richly decorated private chapel built for King Louis IX in the mid-thirteenth century. Building left Great care was taken over the selection of the building materials, which came principally from local sources. There was an abundance of oak and elm on Lord Shrewsbury's Alton estate, and local quarries produced sandstones of various colours and textures. A new quarry for red and white sandstone was opened at Counslow Hill, between Cheadle and Alton, and from here came the stone for both St. Giles' and for the complex of buildings which Pugin and the Earl of Shrewsbury were developing in Alton village, namely Alton Castle and the hospital of St. John the Baptist. It appears that Lord Shrewsbury himself suggested that alabaster should be used for the altars at Cheadle and St. John's, Alton. It carved beautifully and took fine detail, and in pre-Reformation times had been used extensively for statuary and ornamental work. There were local alabaster mines at Fauld, near Tutbury, but instead of being quarried in blocks, the material was simply being blasted out before being ground up to make gypsum, the principal ingredient for plaster-of-Paris. A north porch was added, the south aisle was extended eastwards to form the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, the Lady Chapel was moved over to the North aisle, and the proposed Chapel of St. John was scrapped altogether. The sacristy was extended, and the \\"Rector's Door\\" on the south side of the chancel - planned originally to communicate with the priest's house - became superfluous when the location of the presbytery was moved north-east into Chapel Street. It is a commonly held fallacy that the main functions of the nave and aisles of a church are to seat as many people as possible. That had certainly not been the case in medieval times, when the nave and aisles were regarded not as an auditorium filled with a static body of people in fixed seats, but as a liturgical space in which there was movement and drama (for example the festal processions on high days and holy days, and the penitential processions in Lent). Though benches were not uncommon in medieval times, fixed seating as a generality came about only after the Reformation, and the arrangements in early nineteenth-century Catholic chapels were little different from those of Nonconformist ones, with seating often running right across the width of the building, and with galleries to provide extra accommodation. Pugin would have no such \\"protestantisms\\" at Cheadle. When Lord Shrewsbury proposed to fill St. Giles' with seats running the full width of the nave, without so much as a central passage, Pugin reacted with characteristic indignation. The rood-screen The care which Pugin took over the design of the rood-screen for Cheadle and was passionate over the necessity of screens in general. The joiners began work in February 1842, and Pugin promised that it would be \\"the richest yet produced\\". All went well until, in order to cut costs, Lord Shrewsbury proposed to dispense with the services of an expert wood-carver. The screen could be finished instead by one of his own estate joiners, Thomas Harris, who had already produced carvings at Alton Towers' chapel and at St. John's in Alton. Pugin responded in half-joking fashion, accusing the Earl of penny-pinching, and heading his letter with sketches of a rood-screen and a block of cheese marked \\"2d 1/2\\" a pound. It is not known if the joiner returned. Glazing and tiling Pugin experienced great difficulty in finding stained-glass artists able to make windows to his complete satisfaction, and at the right price. The process involved the working-up of Pugin's drawings into full-sized cartoons, and the production of accurate colours by fusing various pigments onto the glass in a kiln at controlled temperatures. For the Cheadle windows he employed William Wailes of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. With the exception of the figure of St. Giles' in the south aisle, which he had altered at his own expense, Pugin was generally pleased with Wailes's efforts, noting that some of his best craftsmen had gone to Normandy to make special studies of old- style glass. Pugin believed that, after stained glass, encaustic tiles were amongst the most important forms of decorative art. By the winter of 1843 Pugin was able to tell Lord Shrewsbury that the tiles for Cheadle were proceeding well and that they would have \\"the finest floor in Europe\\" The tiles for the chancel and the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament were both rich and expensive. Lord Shrewsbury was concerned that they would be damaged by being constantly walked upon, so he suggested putting down carpets which, in Pugin's view, defeated the object of tiles at all. The Clerk of works, John Denny, suggested a solution: the priest and his assistants would be required to wear special cloth overshoes. Lord Shrewsbury warmed to the idea and told Pugin: \\"You may have your tiles and we shall want no carpet.\\" Consecration The date for the consecration of St. Giles was fixed originally for September 1845 but, with the various alterations, this proved to be overly optimistic. Pugin noted that the spire was topped on 27 June 1845, but the bells did not arrive until January 1846. The bell inscriptions, in Gothic lettering, included invocations of Our Lady, St. Giles, St. Chad and St. Francis. The consecration of the church was postponed for twelve months, but by March 1846 Pugin could not guarantee even that, unless Lord Shrewsbury would allow him to keep a full work-force including joiners and painters. Of particular concern were the great crucifix and carved figures for the roodscreen, which were being made by George Myers at Lambeth. The loss of the sculptor Thomas Roddis, who died in October 1845, was another sad blow, for although Roddis had completed his works at St. Giles' by this time, his contribution to the building was substantial and of superb quality. The consecration of St. Giles' was spread over two days: Monday 31 August and Tuesday 1 September 1846. Pugin was much involved in the ceremonial preparations and also with practical arrangements for getting guests into the church. Cheadle was not served directly by rail with the nearest station being Stafford, and then transport by horse and carriage. The consecration on 31 August 1846 was essentially a private affair in which the building, its furnishings and ornaments were solemnly blessed by Bishop Wiseman, culminating in a High Mass. In the evening Lord Shrewsbury entertained a party of 54 distinguished guests to a dinner at Alton Towers. The more public part of the consecration took place the following morning - St. Giles' Day - when spectators gathered from miles into the streets of Cheadle to witness sights and sounds not experienced since the Reformation: the procession of ten Catholic bishops and two archbishops in full pontifical robes. Significance right The importance of St. Giles' lies in the fact that everything about it is the product of one brilliant mind. Pugin understood all the principles of Gothic art and architecture and knew how to apply them. His busy schedule allowed time for daily Mass as well as morning and evening prayers at home, and he regarded himself first and foremost as a servant of the church as \\"a builder up of men's minds and ideas as well as material edifices\\". It is this which distinguishes Pugin as the principal architect of the Gothic Revival, and St. Giles' as the perfect expression of what he believed an English church should be.  Bell ringing The bells of Cheadle ring to celebrate Mass weekly on either a Saturday evening (16:30-17:00) or Sunday morning (10:00-10:30). Practice takes place on a Tuesday evening.BBC 360 degree viewsFlickr images  Gallery  File:St Giles RC Church Cheadle Staffs NE chapel.jpgNorth East chapel File:St Giles RC Church Cheadle Staffs SE chapel.jpgSouth East chapel File:St Giles Roman Catholic Church, Pugins Gem, Aisle, Cheadle.jpg The nave See also * List of Grade I listed buildings in Staffordshire * Grade I listed churches in Staffordshire * Listed buildings in Cheadle, Staffordshire  References  Category:Roman Catholic churches in Staffordshire Category:Grade I listed Roman Catholic churches in England Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Staffordshire Category:Grade I listed churches in Staffordshire Category:Augustus Pugin buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1846 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United Kingdom Category:Cheadle, Staffordshire ","title":"St Giles' Catholic Church, Cheadle"},{"id":"18725980","text":"Mehraban may refer to: * Katnaghbyur, Aragatsotn, a town in Armenia * Mehraban, Iran, a city in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran * Mehraban, Gilan, a village in Gilan Province, Iran * Mehraban, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, a village in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran * Mehraban, Lorestan, a village in Lorestan Province, Iran * Mehraban District, an administrative subdivision of Iran * Mehraban (sheep), a breed of sheep ","title":"Mehraban"},{"id":"18726038","text":"R53 may refer to : * R53 road (South Africa) * R53: May cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment, a risk phrase * R53 (Mini), an internal designation for a Mini car model ","title":"R53"},{"id":"18726039","text":"David A.

The competition was run on a regional basis, with seven regional associations (Auckland, Walkato, Wellington, Manawatu, Buller, Canterbury, and Otago) each holding separate qualifying rounds. The Westland Association also ran qualifying finals. Taylorville were beaten by Dobson 5 - 1. Runanga and Cobden had to play two replays of the second Westland - Chatham Cup semi-final after the first result, a 4 - 2 victory for Runanga was protested by Cobden. The first replay was played at Dunollie where the large, raucous crowd eventually spilled on to the ground after a fight between two players with one spectator striking the referee. The result, 3 - 2 to Cobden was protested by Runanga. In the deciding third match Cobden finally beat Runanga 4 - 1. In the Westland - Chatham Cup final at Victoria Park, Dobson drew with Cobden 3 - 3. In the replay a week later on the 16th of July, Dobson beat Cobden 3 - 1, once again at Victoria Park. A Westland - Buller decider between Dobson and Millerton All Blacks was scheduled for the 23rd of July, with the victor to play Thistle (Christchurch) in early August. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Auckland YMCA, Hamilton Wanderers, St. Andrews (Manawatu), Wellington Marist, Riccarton, Millerton All Blacks and Maori Hill (Dunedin). The 1932 final Wellington Marist's Eddie Barton became the third player in Chatham Cup history to score a final hat- trick, in front of a crowd of 5000 at the Basin Reserve. The five-goal margin in the final remained a record until 1958. The game was described by contemporary sources as being a fine one, though it was one-sided. The first goal came after 25 minutes when Marist's Stan Marshment scrambled the ball across the line. Barton doubled the score before the interval. In the second half, playing with the stiff breeze, Jim Kershaw (later to become NZFA Chairman) curled the ball into the net directly from a corner. Millerton didn't take the opportunity to pull one back, missing a penalty, and Marist rubbed home the win with two further goals from Barton late on. Millerton, a busy coalmining town in the 1930s, is now a ghost town.

The name comes from the Cornish words melyn meaning mill and heyl meaning estuary - estuary mills.Weatherhill, Craig (1995). Cornish Place Names and Language. Sigma Leisure. . The name was recorded as Mellynheyl in the 19th century, but it had been known as Glyvion.Weatherhill, Craig (2009). A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-Names. Evertype. .

The Menalhyl enters the sea at Mawgan Porth on the north coast of the county, . Tributaries Tributaries to the river include one that rises between the village of Tregonetha and Castle an Dinas, and one whose source is south-east of Tregatillian. A smaller river, from Talskiddy, joins the Menalhyl a short distance from its mouth. The river flows through the settlements of St Columb (the north part of the town, known as Bridge), St Mawgan and Mawgan Porth. Its valley, from St Columb downstream, is called the Vale of Lanherne; it is wooded for much of its length and is popular with walkers. Mills There are a small number of disused mills along the length of the Menalhyl, and the river feeds some small lakes and ponds. It is also used for agricultural purposes along most of its course. Lawry's Mill was a tourist attraction in Victorian times and many postcards were produced featuring the Mill. Fishing The river is fished by anglers, especially in its lower course, and fish species such as brown trout, sea trout, lamprey, eel and minnow have been recorded.

There he adopted the Chinese name Luo Yagu (ÁæÖÈõÖË∞∑), and was also known by his courtesy name Weishao (Âë≥Èü∂). Life The son of a jurist, Rho entered the Society of Jesus at the age of twenty. While later proficient in mathematics, he was a poor student initially. Following his ordination in Rome by Cardinal Bellarmine, he sailed for the Far East in 1617 with forty- four companions. After a brief stay in Goa he proceeded to Macao. During the siege of that city by Dutch forces, he turned the tide of battle by firing a cannon shot which landed on a barrel of gunpowder in the midst of the Dutch formation, saving the city from the attack. This service opened China to him. Rho rapidly acquired a knowledge of the Chinese language and in 1631 he was summoned to Beijing by the emperor to work on reform of the Chinese calendar. Together with Johann Adam Schall von Bell, he occupied himself on this task until the end of his life seven years later, in 1638. Numerous Chinese officials attended his funeral. Rho left works relative both to the correction of the Chinese calendar and to other astronomical and theological questions.

Originally designed as a quick adaptation of the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rules, the game has since been greatly expanded and revised and now utilizes the d20 Modern rules. Several Darwin's World books and supplements have seen print, though most support for the game is still only available in PDF format. In 2010, RPGObjects began producing game books using Pinnacle's Savage Worlds system. Darwin's World was nominated for an Ennie award (Best d20 Game) in 2002. The online e-zine, Post Apocalyptic Dispatch, continues to provide short articles that support game play for both gamemasters and players alike. The game is still heavily supported with new material coming out on a regular basis. Mature Themes Unlike many existing post-apocalyptic role-playing games, Darwin's World is often described as a darker and more \\"realistic\\" game system. In specific, its use of real-life deformities and genetic diseases to portray character defects, as well as issues like slavery, racism, and drug use give it a grittier quality than most post-apocalyptic RPGs, which often have a fantastic or \\"comic book\\" feel that requires a broader willingness to suspend disbelief. Versions 2.0 and 2.5 While the original Darwin's World books clearly put forth a timeline and history, the second edition (and most recent edition, v2.5) has a broader focus intending to provide rules, suggestions, and guidelines for any kind of post-apocalyptic campaign setting. The default setting remains a wasteland created by global nuclear/biological/chemical warfare, however (See Weapon of mass destruction). There is a strong focus on regions that once constituted the Midwest and Western United States; numerous modules published for the game are nominally set in \\"desert\\" or \\"wasteland\\" areas. More specific locations include the desert trade town of Tucumcari, the sunken city of Bakersfield and its strange subterranean monsters, the overgrown ruins of Los Angeles, a San Francisco overrun by anti-technology zealots, and a decadent society thriving in the futuristic domed cities of the Midwest. One supplement went into great detail exploring the fate of the Pacific Northwest.

Caine portrays mob accountant \\"Doc\\" Fletcher who acquires a Swiss bank and a silver mine but must fight a complex struggle in order to keep hold of them. Plot Financial wizard Doc Fletcher goes to Lugano to obtain a bank on behalf of his boss, American mobster Joe Fiore, in order to more easily launder his ill-gotten gains. An impoverished Italian Prince Gianfranco di Siracusa agrees to act as chairman of the board in order to give it an air of respectability. Doc finds that the bank consists of some shabby offices above a pizza restaurant and has only a few hundred dollars in assets. The Prince suggests that they invest in a silver mine recently discovered in Iran by his distant cousins, Agha Firdausi and his sister Shireen. The mine is said to contain $1 billion worth of untapped silver. After visiting the Firdausis in Iran, Doc obtains $5 million from Agha as security for a loan of $20 million and uses the money to obtain better banking premises and put on a major show that attracts powerful investors. In London, metals dealer and one of the richest men in the world Charles Cook is concerned by a drop in the price of silver brought about by the Firdausi silver hitting the market. Discovering that the Lugano bank is financing the operation, he decides that the best way to stop the downward plunge is to take over the bank responsible and close down the mine. He contacts Foreman, president of the First National Bank of California, who agrees to the plan and sends one of his accountants, Donald Luckman, to Lugano to meet Doc and his associates. Luckman's questions makes them suspicious. Doc seduces Donald's fun-loving wife Debbie to find out more. She reveals all about Cook's interest in the mine and the bank. Luckman returns and offers up to $60 million for the bank. Fiore jumps at the opportunity, but Doc does not want to sell and persuades Fiore to give him time to make a bid of his own. Doc meets the Firdausis in Dubai to obtain $60 million to buy the bank, but they reveal there is no silver in the mine, it has all been smuggled from India. The mine was just a cover to obtain the money needed for their operation. Foreman buys the bank then goes to Cook and demands an exorbitant amount for the silver mine only to be told that it does not exist and that he will thus not be refunded the $60 million used to buy the bank. Foreman can recoup the insurance since the purchase report mentions non-existent \\"oil storage tanks\\", thus making a case for fraud. Doc offers to give Foreman an additional $10 million which he will get from Cook in exchange for exclusive purchasing rights to the Firdausi silver. Foreman gives Doc the bank. Luckman then reveals that for the insurance claim to be valid there will have to be a criminal prosecution and a scapegoat will be needed in order to go to prison. The others agree, deciding that it should be Luckman, as he falsified the report. Back in Lugano, the Prince marries Shireen Firdausi. Agha does not attend the wedding and Shireen admits that he was in fact an actor she hired since she doubted if a bank would loan $20 million to a woman. Doc comes across Debbie who has been attending Donald's trial for fraud. She has promised to get a place near the jail in order to be close to him and Doc states that his house is conveniently near the prison itself.

The male-male erotic tradition encompasses poems by major poets such as Abu Nuwas, Michelangelo, Walt Whitman, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, W. H. Auden, Fernando Pessoa and Allen Ginsberg. In the female- female tradition, authors may include those such as Sappho, \\"Michael Field\\", \\"Marie-Madeleine\\" and Maureen Duffy. Other poets wrote poems and letters with homoerotic overtones toward individuals, such as Emily Dickinson to her sister-in-law Susan Huntington Gilbert. English poetry Sonnet 20 The most prominent example in the English language and in the Western canon is that of Sonnet 20 by William Shakespeare. Though some critics have made efforts to preserve Shakespeare's literary credibility by claiming his work to be non- erotic in nature, no critic has disputed that the majority of Shakespeare's sonnets concern explicitly male-male love poetry. The only other Renaissance artist writing in English to do this was the poet Richard Barnfield, who, in The Affectionate Shepherd and Cynthia, wrote homoerotic poetry. Barnfield's poems, furthermore, are now widely accepted as a major influence upon Shakespeare's. In the twentieth century, W. H. Auden and Allen Ginsberg became well known as poets. In Great Britain the pederast Ralph Chubb lived in poverty and produced his own books in limited editions made from illustrated engravings (similar to methods employed by William Blake), which he then erased. During the 19th century the British gay poet Digby Mackworth Dolben was little known; however, in the last decade Lord Alfred Douglas produced a major volume of Dolben's homoerotic poems (1896) published in Paris, written in both English and French translations after the trial of Oscar Wilde for homosexual offences brought about largely by Wilde's love for Douglas. Wilde in De Profundis, a poem about his prison experiences which broke him and led to his death in 1900 in Paris, produced an enduring poem. At the same time A. E. Housman gave voice to gay feelings of fear and guilt in a still- criminalized situation in his A Shropshire Lad (1896). In the twentieth century No√´l Coward wrote witty gay poems while the magician Aleister Crowley wrote works in English. The British savant Anthony Reid created the largest male homosexual anthology of poems: The Eternal Flame (2 volumes, 1992‚Äì2002) which he worked on for nearly fifty years; publication of the second volume was held up by the publisher going bankrupt. The excellent Canadian gay poet Ian Young produced the first major bibliography with his works The Male Homosexual in Literature (2 editions, the second being expanded). The Australian gay poet Paul Knobel's CD-ROM 'An Encyclopedia of Male Homosexual Poetry and its Reception History' (2002) is the largest survey of the subject and comes to one million words with overviews covering over 250 languages and language groups. He has also published A World Overview of Male Homosexual Poetry (2005). Gregory Woods has produced other studies, including a history of gay literature with some reference to poetry. The period since gay liberation (from 1968) has produced dozens of gay poetry anthologies (e.g. 2 edited by Ian Young alone and others by Winston Leyland producer of the excellent gay lib periodical Gay Sunshine, which included poetry); this has mainly been the result of the increasing decriminalisation of gay sex in the Anglo world (male homosexual acts were decriminalized in France in the late 18th century and in Italy in the late 19th). Notable United States gay poets include Dennis Cooper, Gavin Dillard, John Gill, Dennis Kelly, Tom Meyer, Paul Monette, Harold Norse and Jonathan Williams. Rob Jacques has written about the relationship between love and violence in the military. Jamse S. Holmes was a leather poet who emigrated to Amsterdam. Daryl Hine from Canada and David Herkt and Paul Knobel from Australia have written fine gay poems. New Zealand has a vibrant gay culture and has produced some gay poets. The Canadian gay poet Edward A. Lacey died after being run over in the street while drunk in Bangkok; repatriated to Canada, he remained bedridden. His complete poems were only published in the early 21st century. The British poet Thom Gunn lived in the United States and wrote a notable volume inspired by AIDS (which has produced several anthologies). European poetry 125px The first modern European gay anthology was in German compiled by Elisar von Kupffer (1900); it was followed by the poetry and prose anthology Iolaus compiled by the homosexual British socialist Edward Carpenter, which has remained in print almost continuously until today. The 1978 anthology French gay anthology with much poetry and excellent illustrations, L'Amour bleu (French for \\"blue love\\", that is, forbidden love) has been translated into German and English and remains in print. Italian has Michelangelo, the Renaissance painter and sculptor, who wrote homosexual love sonnets while Sandro Penna and Dario Bellezza are twentieth century poets. The Venetian gay poet Mario Stefani died in still unexplained circumstances in the early 21st century. Renzo Paris is a notable contemporary poet. In French there were Rimbaud and Verlaine, who were lovers; some of Verlaine's poems published in the early 1890s were the first open modern French gay poems and influenced Oscar Wilde. Jean Cocteau wrote in the twentieth century where Jean Genet also wrote some gay poems. In German Adolf Brand wrote gay poetry in the early part of the twentieth century as well as producing the major gay periodical Der Eigene (The Special; 1898‚Äì1931), which published gay poetry. The Swiss gay magazine Der Kreis (The circle) carried the flame of gay poetry in the second world war when the Nazi regime in Germany imprisoned many homosexuals, leading to their deaths. Nils Hallbeck was a Swedish gay poet and in the opinion of Anthony Reid, his English translator, one of the finest gay poets ever. Danish and Dutch have also produced fine gay poets. Gertrud von Puttkamer wrote lesbian-themed poetry in the early to mid 1900s. Spain produced Garc√≠a Lorca, who was shot in the Spanish civil war; Lorca and others appear in the anthology Amores iguales (2002) by Antonio de Villena. For South American poets, see the bilingual anthology Now the Volcano (San Francisco, 1979). Antonio Botto is the best known Portuguese poet to write open gay poems; he later lived in Brazil where he died. In Brazil, a gay anthology was produced in 1978 called Poemas do amor mandate (Poems of doomed love). Baltic & Middle Eastern 150px Russian has Kuzmin and Gennady Trifonov (who was imprisoned for writing homosexual poems which were not at the time published). Valery Pereleshin lived in exile in Brazil where he produced a significant body of gay poetry. Poland had gay poets in the early part of the twentieth century and has an increasingly open gay culture. Brane Mozetic writes in Slovene. Turkey has a huge gay poetry heritage as does medieval Hebrew. Hebrew gay poetry has been discussed by Norman Roth, Jefim Schirmann and Dan Pagis and dates from the Middle Ages in Spain. C. M. Naim surveyed gay poetry in an article in Studies in the Urdu ghazal and Prose Fiction (1979) and Ralph Russell has dealt with the subject in various books.  African Very little is known about oral homosexual poems in African cultures.

Geography A road passes through the village and links it to Daska, Sambrial (home of the Sialkot International Airport), and larger cities such as Sialkot and Gujranwala via Bhilo Mahar and Motra Thana (a police station). Nala Aiek stream Ralioke is inhabited on the bank of an ancient natural stream known as \\"Nala Aiek\\" (Nala stands for stream in the local Punjabi language). This stream causes floods in the monsoon season. This stream was the source of water for the villages of this area from the ancient era along with water wells. Today, though, this historic stream is polluted with drain waters. History In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Sialkot District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Sialkot District increased in population and importance. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Sialkot District. Religion The town is predominantly Muslim with small Christian and Ahmadi minority. Language Punjabi and Urdu are the basic languages of the people. The new generation also speaks English. Calendar Three calendars are often used by the villagers. Old age people are well conversant with the Islamic calendar and the Bikrami calendar. Nowadays, though, the most commonly used calendar is the Christian calendar, which is also known as the Gregorian calendar. Almost all the festivals, falling in these calendars, are observed with enthusiasm. Economy and basic professions Ralioke is an agriculture based village. Professions in it include: * Farming * Cattle farming * Fish farming * Poultry farms * Cobbler * Goldsmith * Blacksmith * Carpenter * Watchman Crops Wheat, rice, sunflower, sugarcane, potato, tobacco, Oilseeds, tomatoes, carrots, spinach, leaf vegetables, stem vegetables, onion, garlic and vegetables are major crops harvested by farmers of the village. Crops are divided into two major groups (Rabi crop and Kharif crop). Besides these, farmers keep buffalos and cows for dairy products (e.g. milk, butter, cheese) and goat, sheep and hens/ducks for meat and eggs. Educational institutions Only one Government Primary (up to 5th class) School, which does not have a proper building, exists in the village. Children get education under the trees. For further or proper education students go to the nearby villages Baddoke Cheema and Jamke where middle (up to 8th class) and high schools (up to 10th class) are situated. After matriculation (10th class) students go to Daska, Sialkot or Gujranwala for College education.

This uncertainty is probably largely due to the burning of the St. Francis mission, with all its records, by the English in 1759. Life He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1704 or 1705, and arrived in Canada in 1715 or 1716. He studied the language for some months at the Abnaki mission of Sillery, and then began work at St. Francis, the principal Abnaki mission, remaining there until 1727 or later. He was at Montreal in 1730 and during 1749-54. According to Maurault, he arrived in Canada in June, 1715, and after a short stay at Sillery was sent to B√©cancour, another Abnaki mission, on the St. Lawrence River, where, with the exception of occasional parochial service, he remained until 1753, when he retired to Quebec. Works He wrote, besides prayers, sermons, etc., in the Abnaki language, an account of the Calumet Dance, which gave so much trouble to the early missionaries. The original French manuscript is preserved at St. Francis mission, Pierreville, Canada, and was published in the \\"Soir√©es Canadiennes\\" of 1864. Manuscript copies are in St. Mary's College, Montreal, and with the Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison. According to Maurault, he compiled also a Dictionary of Abnaki, of 900 pages.

Then, under the tutelage of Dan McKenzie at the Bullard Laboratories, Cambridge, he received his PhD in 1980. His research used earthquakes to study the processes that produce the major surface features of the continents, such as mountain belts and basins. Between 1977 and 1981 he was a Visiting Scientist in the Seismic Discrimination Group at MIT before returning to Cambridge to take up a research fellow position in Queens' College, Cambridge, where he became Assistant Dean in 1983. In 1984, he was appointed as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences, Cambridge, lecturer in 1988 and reader in 1996. He was made Professor of Active Tectonics in the Department of Earth Sciences in 2003.University of Cambridge Annual Report, 2003: Awards and prizes and appointments Current research Using evidence from earthquakes, remote sensing, geodesy and geomorphology he is able to observe, quantitatively, the geometry and rates of deformation processes while they are active. In addition to seismology, his current research uses space-based remote sensing (including radar interferometry, GPS measurements and optical imagery) combined with observations of the landscape in the field, to study the evolution and deformation of the continents on all scales, from the movement of individual faults in earthquakes to the evolution of mountain belts.

Tizard was principally notable for important research into neonatology and paediatric neurology and being a founder member of the Neonatal Society in 1959. Tizard was considered the most distinguished academic children's physician of his generation. Life Tizard was the eldest of three sons of Sir Henry Tizard KCB, who was the chief scientific adviser to the government at the outbreak of the World War II. Tizard came from a prominent intellectual family ‚Äì his father, his grandfather and his younger brother were all members of the Royal Society. Indeed, Sir Henry Tizard was the man who many believed was responsible for establishing the radar network that saved Great Britain during the Battle of Britain. Tizard was educated at Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford. He then qualified in medicine at Middlesex Hospital in 1941. He had married (Elizabeth) Joy Taylor in 1945; they had two sons and a daughter. Career During and after World War II, in the years 1942‚Äì1946, Tizard served in the Royal Army Medical Corps undertaking general duties in North Africa, Sicily. Tizard later worked as medical specialist in France, Holland and Germany. After the war in 1947, he was appointed to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, as a registrar then a pathologist. In 1949, unable to secure the position of Consultant at Great Ormond, Tizard was promoted to Consultant, and trained as a paediatrician, while working with Reginald Lightwood at St Mary's Hospital, London and Paddington Green Children's Hospital. After two years, Tizard went to America on a research fellowship as Research Fellow in Pediatrics, at the Harvard Medical School, working with Bronson Crothers. In 1954, he was appointed Reader in paediatrics to the Institute of Child Health, in charge of the neonatal unit and an honorary Consultant paediatrician to Hammersmith Hospital, In 1964 was appointed Professor of Paediatrics at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, University of London, heading the neonatal research unit. In 1972, he became the first Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Oxford, specifically Regius Professor of Physic, which came with a fellowship to Jesus College, Oxford. Tizard replaced his old colleague George Pickering. Between 1970 and 1971, Tizard was President of the European Paediatric Research Society. From 1972 to 1983, Tizard was an honorary Consultant Children's Physician at the Oxfordshire Health Authority. Between 1975 and 1978, Tizard was President of the Neonatal Society. In 1982 Tizard was recognised by the country and Knighted and became a Knight Bachelor. From 1982 to 1985, Tizard was President of the British Paediatric Association. Tizard retired in 1983. He died on 27 October 1993. Neonatal unit At Hammersmith Hospital, Tizard worked to build up an academic neonatal unit that was a pioneer in the establishment of neonatal care in the UK, and established the scientific basis for the development of such units. To prepare for this endeavour, Tizard spent took a sabbatical as a Nuffield Foundation Medical Fellow 1951, spending a year with Geoffrey S. Dawes, the physiologist at the Nuffield Institute for Medical research in Oxford and who considered to be the foremost international authority on fetal and neonatal physiology. In this manner, Tizard changed, what was then neonatal care, into applied physiology, that was unique in medicine, at the time. Tizard recruited a number of brilliant, and now well known individuals. Wilfrid Payne was the first, who had retired and then became an skilled adviser to Tizard. Michael Dawkins, a paediatric pathologist was recruited next. Albert Claneaux, who was Dawkings predecessor at the Institute, had collaborated with Tizard, and gave the first definitive account of the epidemiology of Intraventricular haemorrhage in newborn infants. Dawkins had been working at the Nuffield Institute with David Hull and had established the reason for the response to cold in the human infant. Lawrence Goldie, a psychoanalyst with a specialism in physiology and Pamela Davies were next. Davies was given the task of following up on surviving infants. In collaboration with Goldie, they described the electroencephalographic characteristics in the immature brain. Tizard did more than anybody else in the paediatric medical community to put paediatrics on an equal footing, i.e. as a medicine for children, with medicine for adults, that was based on knowledge, as opposed to acquired experience, as Tizard's group at Hammersmith Hospital had sufficient intellectual stamina to acquire that knowledge through research. Therefore, it was a disappointment when the British Paediatric Association asserted its independence, by establishing paediatrics as a speciality, and breaking away from the Royal College of Physicians, rather than the hard won position that Tizard's group had won for it, within general medicine. Character Although unable to suffer fools or the pretentious, Tizard was known to enjoy the position of power and responsibility. On first meeting, Tizard was often considered brutally frank and forthright in conversation, but was generally supportive, and was at this best working with patients, whom he treated with respect and dignity. Life most men who were strong and assertive, Tizard made both friends and enemies, but was able to form life long friends, and was considered brave and persistent, but fair minded. Tizard was considered a good companion, who could tell a good story. Awards and honours Tizard received many awards and honours throughout this lifetime, but he took particular pleasure in receiving the following: * Being elected to the prestigious German Scientific Society known as the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. * Being appointed as Prime Warden of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. * Award of the James Spence Medal of the British Paediatric Association in 1986.

It was directed by Dzhanik Fayziev and written by Akunin himself. The film starred Marat Basharov, Yegor Beroyev and Olga Krasko. The Turkish Gambit was a box office success, although it received mixed reviews from critics. Plot The film takes place in Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). Erast Fandorin is put on the trail of a Turkish agent who is trying to disrupt the Russian advance during the Siege of Plevna. The agent, known as Anwar Efendi, is a master of disguise and has excellent command of Russian. Change from the book Unlike the ending of the book, where French correspondent d'Hervais is exposed as being Anwar in disguise, in the film Anwar turns out to have been posing as a seemingly awkward and stupid Russian captain. In the book, unlike the film, Fandorin did not escape by clinging to the underbelly of a carriage but was actually released by the governor of Viddin Yusuf Pasha after winning a wager. The scene where Varvara and Fandorin flew in the balloon never took place in the book and Varvara had no role in discovering the weaknesses of the Turkish defenses. The scene in the cave with the Lieutenant Luntz did not take place in the book. The character of the homosexual Luntz was created for the movie. The homosexual nature of Kazanzaki is never alluded to in the film. In fact, Fandorin was never once shot at by Anwar Effendi in the book. In the book, the evidence for Colonel Lukan's involvement in treason was found on him and not in his tent like in the film. Colonel Lukan was killed in a duel whereby sabres were used rather than pistols. The book refers to three main failed assaults on Plevna. The film shows only two. In the book, when Fandorin hears about Osman Pasha's plans to 'surrender' he rushes to Sobolev to urge him to attack Plevna and not to the meeting point of the Turkish 'envoys'. In the film Fandorin went to Istanbul and showed up at the end in Turkish attire. In the book he never went to Istanbul and arrived wearing European clothing. In the film Fandorin was happy to see his old friend Count Zurov when Zurov first arrived, whereas in the book the Zurov and Fandorin were not close friends and the first meeting in the tent was rather chilly.

It was written by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas and produced by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields, for Lovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget. The song features Jack Lawless on drums and John Taylor and the Jonas Brothers on guitars. The initial writing of the song took place when Lovato wanted to write a song about getting back together with an old boyfriend, as opposed to writing mean or heartbroken songs. \\"Get Back\\" was released by Hollywood Records as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008. Musically, the song is an upbeat rock song with a guitar-driven sound. The song was met with positive reviews from critics and performed average commercially, peaking at number forty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 and ninety-three on the Canadian Hot 100. In Australia, the song peaked at number ten on the ARIA Hitseekers chart. Lovato has performed the song on several occasions, including the 2008 Disney Channel Games, Good Morning America and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Background \\"Get Back\\" was written by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, and produced by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields. Lovato wanted to write a song about getting back together with someone, as she believed enough mean and heartbroken songs had already been made. She said, \\"It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's kind of just fun to sing to the person that I wrote it about.\\" The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co- producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. Composition \\"Get Back\\" is an upbeat guitar-driven rock song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a tempo of 150 beats per minute. It is performed in the key of G mixolydian and Lovato's vocals span from the note of B3 to the note of G5. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the song's sound to works by Tommy Tutone. Lyrically, the song is about a desire to get back together with an old boyfriend, demonstrated in the lines \\"I want to get back to the old days\\", and \\"Kiss me like you mean it\\". Music video and live performances Lovato performing \\"Get Back\\" at Club Nokia, September 2011 \\"Get Back\\" was directed by Philip Andelman and shot in one day. The video premiered on Disney Channel on August 22, 2008, following the premiere of The Cheetah Girls: One World. It was later made available for digital download on iTunes Store on September 16, 2008. The video begins with a shot of the Manhattan Bridge, Lovato and her band are then seen on a small stage on top of a building. Lovato sports black clothing, a beaded scarf and red gloves. Throughout the first verse and chorus, Lovato dances around on stage with Manhattan Bridge visible in the background. Following the first chorus, the sun goes down and an aerial shot of the city's nightlife is shown. The second verse and chorus are performed during night. During the song's bridge, a daytime shot is shown of Lovato while sitting alone on the rooftop and looking away from the camera. After this, she is back on stage and performing the last chorus during nighttime with bright lights in the background. The video ends with the performance being finished, with Lovato turning around and walking towards her band. Lovato performed the song for the first time at the 2008 Disney Channel Games on May 3, 2008. Later, Lovato performed the song during her appearances in Good Morning America and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. On January 19, 2009, Lovato performed the song alongside \\"La La Land\\" at the Kids' Inaugural: \\"We Are the Future\\" event in Washington, D.C., at the Verizon Center. The event was held to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States. On April 24, 2009, Lovato performed an acoustic version of \\"Get Back\\" in Radio Disney's network studio. Also in April 2009, the song was performed as part of the iTunes Live from London series. The full performances were released as an iTunes Store-exclusive extended play featuring recorded live versions on May 17, 2009. In May 2009, Lovato performed the song at a Walmart concert, which was released as Demi Lovato: Live: Walmart Soundcheck, featuring recorded live versions on a CD, and the full performances on a DVD. Lovato performed \\"Get Back\\" on her Warm Up Tour and the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour, for the latter she served as the opening act during the summer of 2008. Later in 2009, the song was performed during her Summer Tour 2009. The song was performed last, and Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic called it \\"super-charged\\". In 2010, she performed the song during her South American tour as the show's finale. Lovato also performed the song as the opening number for her set during the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert World Tour 2010. In September 2011, Lovato performed the song during the revue concert An Evening with Demi Lovato. Critical reception The song received positive reviews from critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called \\"Get Back\\" a \\"welcome girl-rock hit\\". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his \\"Top 10 from the Disney girls\\" list, and said, \\"She wrote this with the Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or the sort of thing Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'\\". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does \\"nearly everything Lovato touches\\". Masley concluded, writing, \\"When she sings 'I want to get back to the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it \\"undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails.\\" Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an \\"insidious, Go-Go's-like single\\". Chart performance On August 30, 2008, \\"Get Back\\" debuted at its peak position of number at number forty-three on the Billboard Hot 100. The following week, it fell fifty places to number ninety-three. The song spent a total of six weeks on the chart.

History The first date at which a windmill is definitely known to have been standing here is 1707. A date of 1680 is given by some sources, but no mill was marked on Ogilby and Morgan‚Äôs map of 1678. It cannot be proved or disproved that a mill was standing here in 1680. The most likely date of erection of Gibraltar Mill is 1704. A possible scenario being an earlier mill having been blown down in the Great Storm of 1703 and the present mill replacing it. By 1754, the mill had been converted to a cottage. The mill was put back to work as a windmill by 1806, when it was insured for ¬£300, having only been insured for ¬£50 in 1800. The mill was worked in conjunction with the nearby Great Bardfield Watermill at various times. A new cast iron windshaft was fitted in 1877, replacing the former wooden one. It was cast by Christy and Norris, millwrights of Chelmsford and fitted by Sillitoe and Brewer, millwrights of Long Melford, Suffolk. In January 1899, the sails were blown off and the cap severely damaged when the mill was tailwinded. The mill stood capless until 1904, when a new cap and sails were fitted, and a fantail added to replace the former internal winch winding system. The mill was working until 1930 It was threatened with demolition in 1938, but Essex County Council used their powers under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932 to prevent demolition. After the death of the last miller in the late 1950s it was stripped of machinery and house converted. One of the sails was damaged in the Great Storm of 1987. Description Gibraltar Mill is a three-storey tower mill with a boat-shaped cap. The mill has four double Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft and is winded by an eight-bladed fantail. The tower is to thick at base level. It is high, diameter at base level and diameter at curb level. The mill is high overall. The windshaft carries a wooden Brake Wheel with 90 iron teeth, cast in six segments. The Wallower was an iron mortice gear, with 44 wooden cogs. It was carried on a cast-iron Upright Shaft. The Great Spur Wheel had 88 cogs, and drove two pairs of millstones via Stone Nuts with 18 cogs each.

He left in July 1983 to take up a position as a Teaching Fellow at Griffith University, Brisbane, but ultimately settled in Sydney as a full-time author in 1984.[National Library of Australia Oral History collection, ORAL TRC 3101 & TRC 5306 & Wallace Kirsop, 'Edward Duyker, or the Achievements of Independent Scholarship', Explorations (Institute for the Study of French- Australian Relations), no. 36, June 2004, pp. 17‚Äì18.] Using the Dutch and French linguistic resources of his family, he edited The Discovery of Tasmania (1992) which brought together all known journal extracts from the first two European expeditions to Van Diemen's Land. An Officer of the Blue (1994), Duyker's biography of the explorer Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne An Officer of the Blue (1994) was the subject of an essay, 'The Tortoise Wins Again!', by Professor Greg Dening, published in his collection Readings/Writings (Melbourne University Press, 1998, pp. 201‚Äì4). Nature's Argonaut (1998), Edward Duyker's biography of Daniel Solander the naturalist on HM Bark Endeavour and the first Swede to circle the globe, was shortlisted for the New South Wales Premier's History Awards in 1999. Duyker is also the co-editor, with Per Tingbrand, of Daniel Solander: Collected Correspondence 1753‚Äì1782 (1995), With his mother Maryse Duyker he published the first English translation of the journal of the explorer Bruny d'Entrecasteaux in 2001. It has become an important Western Australian and Tasmanian historical source and, with its annotations and introduction, informed public debate regarding the heritage-listing of Recherche Bay in Tasmania.see Mulvaney, J., 'The axe had never sounded': Place, People and Heritage of Recherche Bay, Tasmania, ANU E Press and Aboriginal History, Canberra, 2007.

With former Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown, archaeologist Professor John Mulvaney and broadcaster Peter Cundall, Duyker was an outspoken campaigner for the protection of Recherche Bay from logging. Fran√ßois P√©ron: An Impetuous Life (2006),Fran√ßois P√©ron: An Impetuous Life (2006) Duyker's biography of the zoologist of the expedition of Nicolas-Thomas Baudin to Australian waters (1800‚Äî1803), won the Frank Broeze Maritime History Prize in 2007. In 2007 Edward Duyker published A Dictionary of Sea Quotationsof Sea Quotations with a deeply personal introduction on his family's links with the sea. Duyker's biographies of naturalists are largely conventional linear narratives, but they are characterised by meticulous research and great attention to detail ‚Äì 'written with verve, but fortified with awesome scholarship' as Dymphna Clark put it in her review of Nature's Argonaut.Dymphna Clark, 'Handmaiden to Botany's Giants', Canberra Times, 16 May 1998, Panorama, pp. 7‚Äì8. He makes a point of visiting the places he writes about and orienting explorers' maps and journals to a modern landscape or coast.Duyker 'A Stout Pair of Boots: Recollections of an Historian in the Field‚Äô, Theo Barker Memorial Lecture, August 2005, Charles Sturt University Library, 907.2 DUYK Professor Thomas Nossiter of the London School of Economics praised Duyker's Tribal Guerrillas because 'it exemplifies the value of synthesising anthropology and history; and, more generally, it is a scholarly contribution to a literature on tribal rebellion and insurgency far wider than India, which embraces Greece, Vietnam and Algeria as well as sub-Saharan Africa where tribal responses to imperialism and modernisation have been significant' (Third World Quarterly, vol. 11, no. 2, April 1989, pp. 226‚Äì7). This meeting ground between history and anthropology can also be seen in An Officer of the Blue, Duyker's biography of Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne, in which he skilfully used missionary and other accounts of MƒÅori oral history and French journals to explain the circumstances of the explorer's death in New Zealand's Bay of Islands in 1772. Prof. Barrie Macdonald of Massey University described it as \\"a fine piece of detective work ‚Äì a biography written with an empathy with its subject yet a critical eye that helps set in context a death that still has its significance in New Zealand history.\\"Barrie Macdonald, New Zealand Herald, Sat. 14 January 1995. Since 1985, Duyker has written more than 90 entries for the bilingual Dictionnaire de Biographie Mauricienne/Dictionary of Mauritian Biography published on his mother's native island. In November 2017, he was made an honorary member of the Soci√©t√© d'Histoire de l'Ile Maurice, in recognition of these contributions and for his books on the history of the Mauritians in Australia, Mauritian Heritage and Of the Star and the Key, Duyker has also written a number of pioneering monographs on the Dutch in Australia,See Gunew, S., L.

Other positions Between 1996 and 2002 he served as the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Mauritius in New South Wales. Critical Responses Duyker's writings span a diverse range of subjects and disciplines. In many respects he has built his readership on his eclectic interests and made a strength of them.See the summation of CSIRO scientist Richard Groves in Historical Records of Australian Science (14, 2003):Richard Groves, Historical Records of Australian Science (14, 2003) The late Professor Greg Dening once described him as 'an historian's historian' (Australian Book Review, June/July 2003, p. 10).Australian Book Review, June/July, 2003, p. 10 Marius Damas, in his book (Approaching Naxalbari, Radical Impression, Calcutta, 1991, p. 68) commented that \\"Duyker brings both historical and anthropological tools into play . . . Drawing on a wide range of historical and contemporary sources, including personal interviews . . . [and] provides us with a richly detailed account.\\" Reviewing An Officer of the Blue Professor Michael Roe (historian) wrote: \\"In building his story, Duyker has to confront matters of war, politics, geography, navigation, anthropology ‚Äì the list could continue. He does so with constant skill and authority.\\"The Mercury, Hobart, 28 May 1994, p. 38. In 1995 Paul Brunton described Duyker's (and Per Tingbrand's) Daniel Solander: Collected Correspondence (1995) as 'a major contribution to textual scholarship'.Sydney Morning Herald, 24 June 1995, Spectrum, p. 13A In 2006, Prof. Arthur Lucas, former principal of King's College London, wrote that Citizen Labillardi√®re was an 'exceptionally readable, richly textured work . . . The life Duyker recreates is as rich as that of the hero of any adventure novel, and the context is insightful history, not just the history of an important natural historian'. Duyker's biography of French explorer Jules S√©bastien C√©sar Dumont d'Urville was shortlisted and a runner-up for the 2015 Frank Broeze Maritime History Prize. One of the judges wrote that it was 'a thoroughly and meticulously prepared history of one of the giants of French voyaging'. Another judge described it as a 'monumental work'.

He was the benefactor of the Fordham collection housed by the Royal Geographical Society - one of the most important map collections in the country. Fordham was born in Odsey and attended University College, London where he became a member of the Geological Society. After college he joined the family brewing business but left and in 1885 was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. Between 1874 and 1892 he published several papers on the geology, natural history, and botany of Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. In 1887 he published Rural Municipalities and the Reform of Local Government. In 1891, on the death of his father, Fordham returned to the family business. From 1904 he served in local government, chairing Cambridgeshire County Council and receiving a knighthood in 1908. In 1918 he contested the West Fulham election as the Liberal candidate. He lost partly due to his opposition to conscription. From 1920 he was deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. He actively opposed the creation of the county borough of Cambridge. From 1900 he began to collect old maps and road books, initially from England and later from abroad. Using both his own and the collections of others, he began publishing and printing on maps including Studies in Carto-Bibliography in 1914. In 1929 he was awarded the gold medal of the Brussels Geographical Society recognising him as one of Europe's foremost authorities on cartography. Fordham donated some rare maps and atlases to both the British Museum and to Cambridge University Library and he bequeathed 1300 volumes, including rare road books and itineraries, to the Royal Geographical Society. He also donated the Anglo-Saxon Guilden Morden boar, discovered by his father, to the British Museum.

(Two women had been executed in 1739). Eliphaz, the son of Joseph and Hannah Dow, was a shoemaker, married but with no known children. He was convicted of the murder of Peter Clough, also from Hampton Falls. It appeared, upon evidence, that a feud had subsisted between them for quite some time. On 12 December 1754, they accidentally met at the house of Eliphaz' brother Noah Dow. They began to threaten each other, then Clough challenged Dow to go out of the house to fight. Clough went outside and Dow followed. Dow picked up his brother's hoe and struck Clough with a massive blow on the side of the head which instantly killed him. Trial and execution Dow was arrested on the same day of the crime. He went before the Honorable Judge Meshech Weare. He was committed to the prison in Portsmouth. \\"At the February term of Superior Court, he was indicted, tried & convicted: and sentence was pronounced upon him that he should be hanged by the neck until he should be dead.\\" His sentence was ordered to be executed on March 20, 1755. Dow had two reprieves that were allowed until May 8, 1755. Eliphaz pleaded \\"strictly self defense\\" at his trial. He was the first male to be executed in New Hampshire. Many people came out to see the public execution. The exact location of the gallows has been debated for some time. Some accounts have descriptions of the corner of South and Sagamore Streets. Some historic accounts have the location of Ward's Corner. He was hanged for about three hours, between the time of twelve noon until three in the afternoon. His body was buried in the road a few rods from the gallows, just at the declivity of the hill. An account in the New Hampshire Gazette, August 24, 1847, states that bones discovered near the site were \\"doubtless\\" his. The bones were only three or four feet under ground, and \\"together with the bones, were found pieces of bark and leather.\\" This was thought to indicate that he was buried with his shoes on.

The final report, published at the end of 2006 recommended that UK should urgently and dramatically raise achievements at all levels of skills and recommended that it commit to becoming a world leader in skills by 2020, as benchmarked against the upper quartile of the OECD - effectively a doubling of attainment at most skill levels. Background The Leitch Review was launched due to concerns over the ability of UK to compete in the increasingly globalised markets due to poor levels of literacy and numeracy in some sections of the workforce, and due to the UK's relatively poor international position in intermediate level skills and productivity. The Government's 2004 pre-budget document Skills in the global economy identified that this was reflected in the relatively low proportion of young people remaining in education after the age of 16, together with limited skills progression and training to higher levels once in work. As a result of such concerns it was announced in the 2004 Pre-Budget Report that Lord Leitch had been jointly commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Education Secretary to prepare a report. Findings and recommendations After an interim report, Skills in the UK: the long term challenge, published in December 2005, the final Leitch Report was published in December 2006 as Prosperity for all in the global economy ‚Äì world class skills. It recommends that the UK should aim to be a world leader on skills by 2020, and suggested how that aim should be achieved. The Report found that the UK currently ranked 12th out of 18 comparative members of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development). The Report states that by 2020: *95% of adults should have achieved the basic skills of functional literacy and numeracy, an increase on 85% literacy and 79% numeracy in 2005; *more than 90% of adults should be qualified to at least Level 2 (equivalent to five good GCSEs or their vocational equivalents), an increase from 69% in 2005, with a commitment to achieve 95% as soon as possible; *the balance of intermediate skills should have shifted from Level 2 to Level 3 (equivalent to two or more A Levels), which means achieving 1.9 million additional Level 3 attainments and 500,000 apprenticeships; *more than 40% of adults should be qualified to Level 4 and above (equivalent to degree-level qualifications), up from 29% in 2005. The Leitch Report emphasises the necessity of shared responsibility: employers and individuals, as well as the government, should increase their investment in training and education. Employers and individuals should contribute most to training which gives them ‚Äòprivate‚Äô benefits, while government investment should focus on promoting basic skills for everyone. A significant change recommended by Leitch is that the provision of vocational education and training should be demand-led, adaptable and responsive. Employers should therefore be directly involved in deciding what training priorities should be. Targeted individuals will also be empowered to purchase the type of training they need through the introduction of Skills Accounts. Implementation As a result of the Leitch Report the Government merged several organisations to form the UK Commission for Employment and Skills following Leitch's recommendation to ‚Äòdepoliticise‚Äô the skills agenda by securing a broad political and stakeholder consensus for the UK‚Äôs world-class ambitions for 2020 and beyond. Following the report, there has already been a significant change in the government‚Äôs approach to training for young people and adults. The 14‚Äì19 age group has seen an increase in the number of publicly funding training opportunities. The government is also introducing an entitlement for 14- to 19-year-olds to access training across a range of education providers to widen the choice of subjects available. Diplomas, the International Baccalaureate and Apprenticeships are all part of this agenda. Other policies include raising the statutory age at which young people leave full-time education to 18 and encouraging collaboration between neighbouring education institutions. The greatest changes will be in adult education and will involve a much greater competitive element to provision, funding and custom. Criticism Because most public funding will be directed towards level 2 skills, adults wanting to augment their skills at levels 3 or 4 will have to pay more than at present. This has provoked debate about whether the ramifications of the Leitch Report will stifle the benefits of learning for learning‚Äôs sake. Some 5 months after publication of the review, the CBI, employers and Skills Envoy Sir Digby Jones criticised the Government over their delay in implementing the 'Skills Pledge', which Leitch recommended all employers should sign, committing them to training all their workers to Level 2 by 2010.

The crest and motto are barely legible above a memorial to William Kirkpatrick. Clan Kirkpatrick is a Lowland armigerous Scottish clan. There are several variations of the Kirkpatrick name; Kilpatric, Kilpatrick, and Gilpatrick. The names Kirkpatrick and Kilpatrick may have been interchangeable at one time. The clan is recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, however the clan does not currently have a chief so recognised. The surname Kirkpatrick is also a recognized sept of Clan Douglas and Clan Colquhoun. History=Origins of the clanTraditional origins= The clan takes its name from the church of Saint Patrick in the parish of Closeburn in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 411 - 412. Traditionally the Kirkpatrick family of Closeburn have held these lands since the ninth century. =Recorded origins= The family first appear on record in the twelfth century when Ivone de Kirkpatrick witnessed a charter of the Clan Bruce. Ivone also received a charter of confirmation for all of his lands that was granted to him by Alexander II of Scotland. Wars of Scottish Independence Roger Kirkpatrick was an attendant of Robert the Bruce when he killed John \\"the Red\\" Comyn, chief of Clan Comyn in the church at Dumfries. It is said that Kirkpatrick met the Bruce rushing out of the church exclaiming that he thought he had killed Comyn and that Kirkpatrick then drew his dagger with the words, I'll mak siccar; the clan motto and chief's coat of arms allude to this story. Kirkpatrick was sent on an embassy in 1314 with Sir Neil Campbell of Clan Campbell into England and in recompense the Kirkpatrick family received the lands of Redburgh. Sir Roger Kirkpatrick distinguished himself in 1355 when he took both Caerlaverock Castle and Dalswinton Castle from the English. In 1357 Kirkpatrick was murdered by his kinsman, Sir James Lindsay of Clan Lindsay in a private quarrel. The title then passed through a nephew to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, who in 1409 received from Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany the baronies of Closeburn and Redburgh. 16th and 17th centuries In 1526 a feud arose with the Clan Charteris.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 100 - 101. It is recorded in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials of Scotland that John Charteris of Amisfield, along with his brother and two sons, were charged with the murder of Roger Kilpatrick, son of Alexander Kilpatrick in March 1526. In 1542 Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick's grandson, another Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, was taken prisoner at the Battle of Solway Moss. The estate then passed through a cousin and in 1685 Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick of Closeburn was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia for his support of Charles I of England. The mansion house that was built by the 1st Baronet burned down in a fire. The 4th Baronet, Sir James sold the Closeburn estates. In 1563 John Carruthers of Howmains, of Clan Carruthers was indicted, along with Edward Irvine of Bonshaw (chief of Clan Irvine), for an assault on Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, as well as for slaying several other persons.Way, George and Squire, Romily.

The Craig/Douglas family first came to Lewa Downs in 1922 and managed it as a cattle ranch for over 50 years. Unlike many other ranchers in the area, they had always valued the wildlife that shared the land with the cattle and developed wildlife tourism as an additional activity. By the early 1980s it was uncertain whether any black rhinos would survive in Kenya. Poaching for horn had reduced Kenya's rhinos from some 20,000 in the mid-1970s to a few hundred by 1986. It was clear that the only way to prevent their complete extinction was to create high security sanctuaries. In 1983 the Craigs and Mrs. Anna Merz ‚Äì who funded the program ‚Äì decided to establish the fenced and guarded Ngare Sergoi Rhino Sanctuary at the western end of Lewa Downs. The rhino sanctuary was stocked partly with animals from other reserves and partly by isolated individuals from northern Kenya, whose likely survival was a matter of months at most. The black rhino that were caught settled down and bred, and white rhino were added. After ten years, it was clear that the rhinos needed more space, and the sanctuary was expanded to cover the rest of the ranch, and the adjoining Ngare Ndare Forest Reserve. In 2001 Lewa partnered with Gerald Chamales to change his company's name to Rhinotek Computer Products, when the company began sending part of its annual revenue to support Lewa. The perimeter was almost entirely fenced, for security and to ensure that elephants did not raid crops in neighbouring farms, but the ecological connections between Lewa and neighbouring wildlife areas were maintained by leaving gaps in the fence for animal movements. At the same time the entire property was converted to a wildlife sanctuary, as the Craig family handed over the management of the ranch to a non-profit organisation ‚Äì the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The conservancy is home to Lewa Airport. Annually, the Lewa Marathon is held in the Lewa Conservancy for fundraising purposes. Unlike normal marathons, Lewa Marathon is contested on dirt track.Lewa Marathon On 19 October 2010, Prince William of Wales proposed marriage to Catherine Middleton at Lewa. That year 13% of kenya's rhinos lived in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy - 66 white rhinos and 72 black rhinos.  Wildlife and security on Lewa  East African cheetahs. The Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is relatively close to historically volatile areas of northern Kenya, where banditry, poaching and illegal firearms were once prolific. The threat to Lewa's wildlife and, in particular, its rhinos is ever present, although with improved security throughout northern Kenya and increasingly good relations with its neighbours, the situation has improved in recent years. The rhinoceros population requires constant monitoring and protection due to their threatened status, continued pressure and the recent occurrence of rhino poaching elsewhere in the country. To provide a high level of protection for the wildlife, especially the endangered wildlife, as well as the people on Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, it is essential to have an extremely effective security system. Lewa's security operation includes a well-trained and highly motivated ranger force, both armed and unarmed; a tracker dog team; and reliable communications network with its neighbours, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), local government agencies, community conservancies affiliated to the Northern Rangelands Trust and private wildlife conservation projects and conservancies in the area. Regular aerial surveillance is carried out and the boundary electric game fence is maintained. Neighboring communities, the Kenya Wildlife Service and other organisations frequently request Lewa's assistance with support and follow-up to incidents such as poaching, cattle rustling, robbery and banditry. Lewa is in a position to respond rapidly and effectively to such incidents. Lewa's internal security operations have a good record: only two rhinos have been lost to poaching on the Conservancy (Ntoiye and Tana, were shot on 26 December 2009; Tana survived until 5 March 2010). Lewa was the only wildlife sanctuary in Kenya not to have lost a rhino to poachers in 2014. A similar shorter article is also available on the Internet at Lewa‚Äôs anti- poaching teams have been deployed to other rhino sanctuaries following serious levels of rhino poaching and have effectively reduced rhino poaching as a result. In 2015 Edward Ndiritu, employed at Lewa as head of the Anti-Poaching Unit and the Northern Rangeland Trust, received the Tusk Wildlife Ranger Award from Prince William.

It is owned by Agoda Company Pte. Ltd., headquartered in Singapore, and a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. About half of Agoda's bookings are made via its mobile apps. Agoda also offers iOS and Android apps for hotel and property owners. The Grab mobile app allows users to book on Agoda. History Agoda was co-founded by Michael Kenny and Robert Rosenstein. Prior to Agoda, Michael Kenny started two other hotel booking websites, PlanetHoliday.com and PrecisionReservations.com, but combined companies into Agoda in 2003, launching Agoda.com in 2005. In 2007, Agoda was acquired by Booking Holdings (formerly The Priceline Group). In July 2011, Agoda launched iOS and Android mobile apps for booking hotels. In 2014, Booking Holdings acquired Qlika, an Israel-based startup focused on optimization of pay-per-click advertising, and the Qlika team joined Agoda to automate and scale its marketing systems. In May 2016, Booking Holdings acquired WooMoo, a Taipei-based startup focused on mobile app prototyping, and the WooMoo team joined Agoda in Bangkok to work on mobile app development. In May 2016, Agoda reviews began to appear on Google search results. In 2017, Agoda began exploring non-hotel accommodations to try and appeal to millennials. In 2018, CEO and co-founder Rob Rosenstein became the Chairman of Agoda and a Strategic Advisor to Booking Holdings. John Wroughton Brown, the COO, was promoted as the new CEO of Agoda, with Chief Product Officer Omri Morgenshtern, who joined the company as part of the Qlika acquisition, named as the new COO. In April 2019, Agoda announced an interest in pursuing greater business emphasis in Israel and Europe, particularly expanding its Tel Aviv- based data science team, increase sales, and purchase promising Israeli startups. In September 2019, Agoda began work with Digitas for data-driven content marketing across various Asian markets. In October 2019, Agoda added a feature called Mix and Save, which allows customers to easily book a different room for every night of stay to get the best deal. In May 2020, Agoda lays off 1,500 people as it struggles to cope financially amid Covid19. Product Overview Agoda offers over 2.5 million properties globally. In addition to its accommodation booking platform, Agoda also has its own flight product, allowing users to book airfares on its site without having to leave the platform. This was introduced in October 2019. The Agoda VIP program enables participating properties to offer exclusive discounts to Agoda VIP status customers, categorized as VIPs because they have made a minimum of five bookings on Agoda in the past 24 months, and are less inclined to cancel bookings. Hotel partners receive special VIP badges displayed on their property on both Agoda.com and on the Agoda mobile app. Agoda offers a \\"Book Without a Credit Card\\" option for hotels in Indonesia and Philippines, and is the first online digital travel booking platform to enable Australians to book and pay for their holiday accommodation via interest-free instalments. Criticism=Rewards program In 2015, USA Today deemed Agoda's reward program to be the worst out of the four booking sites it reviewed. Hotel burglary incident In 2018, a customer who booked through the website had items stolen from her hotel room due to poor security. Agoda gave her a goodwill refund, but did not remove the hotel or allow her to post a review criticizing the hotel for legal reasons. A security consultant discussed how this policy reduces the number of negative reviews and that negative reviews are sometimes diluted. Refusal to offer refund In 2017, Agoda initially refused to give a refund to a customer that booked a non-existent hotel. The incident gained traction on social media, and Agoda eventually paid a refund following a fraud complaint filed with the Thai government. Difficulty in leaving the platform In 2019, Agoda was criticized for difficulties with customers removing their homes from the website. The customers cited customer service issues. Probe of hotel sites by United Kingdom In 2017, Agoda, among other hotel sites, was subject to a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom. The probe was related to \\"concerns about hidden charges, pressure selling tactics, misleading discount claims and the order in which results appear on the site pages.\\" Agoda agreed to change how it operates in response to this probe. Requests to drop illegal hotels In 2017, the Tourism Minister of Thailand called for Agoda among others to drop illegal and unregistered hotels. Agoda was the main target of criticism among those criticized, and its success is part of what drove the Ministry of Tourism & Sports to create a competitive hotel booking website. In 2018, Agoda cooperated with the Taipei City Government's request to remove illegal and unregistered Taipei hotels from its listings. Agoda faced legal action from the Turkish Travel Agencies Association due to alleged unfair competition in relation to the country's competition law. It faced a potential ban as part of this lawsuit. In November 2018, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission issued a remedial order to Agoda on its refund policies following its noncompliance with a ruling they made. Text messages to customers In 2018, a class action lawsuit in the U.S. accusing the company of spamming customers by sending them text messages confirming reservations and promoting the mobile app was dismissed, as the courts deemed them to be transactional messages, and thus no express written consent was required. Reduction in hotel profits Agoda's Mix and Save feature leads to shorter stays, which increases hotel upkeep costs thereby reducing profits.

Background Following the presidential election of 1904, charges were made against the victor, Theodore Roosevelt, regarding his acceptance of corporate contributions to his campaign. In response, Roosevelt in his annual address to Congress in 1905 called for the prohibition of such contributions: Roosevelt repeated his call in the report to Congress for 1906, saying \\"I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already passed one House of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly.\\" Contents United States Senator Benjamin Tillman. In response to Roosevelt's call, Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina sponsored the bill that became known as the Tillman Act. The bill passed the Senate on June 9, 1906. On June 17, 1906, The New York Times reported that \\"One 'great financial authority who is a Republican' gave assurance that 'he and all the financial men with whom I have talked have welcomed this legislation with very much the same emotions with which a serf would hail his liberation from a tyrannous autocrat'.\\"The New York Times of June 17, 1906 on page 8, the bottom of column 2, continuing to the top of column 3 The article further stated that if the bill passes the House, \\"it will not bring about the millennium, but will lessen a very mean and sordid practice of blackmail... the great number of corporations that have suffered extortion through weakness and cowardice will have their backbones stiffened, and parties will be put to it to fill their coffers by really voluntary contributions.\\" The Senate bill was subsequently amended to add a minimum fine provision and the possibility of a prison term for officers and directors. It was signed into law by President Roosevelt on January 26, 1907. The Act provided in full as follows: The language of the Act provided for penalties but no actual enforcement method; no Federal Election Committee or similar body yet existed to enforce the provisions. There were no existing disclosure requirements for candidates accepting contributions, and so there was no effective way to enforce the new law. The Act applied to general elections, but not primary elections. In the South, the grip of the Democratic Party was absolute, and so the primary election was the most important contested race. Further, a corporation could circumvent the law by directing its officers or directors to make personal contributions to a candidate, which were not prohibited, and then simply give them bonuses at year end to effectively reimburse them for those contributions. The Tillman Act was therefore simply a first step towards regulation of campaign finance. Additional steps would be taken by Congress in the disclosure provisions of the Publicity Act of 1910 (also known as the Federal Corrupt Practices Act), and the extension of the Tillman Act to primary elections in the 1911 amendments to the Tillman and Publicity Acts.

His father, who was a house painter, died just after Arthur's fifth birthday, and his mother went out to service: in 1881 when she was aged 50 she was working for a lady at 11 Warnborough Road in north Oxford, and Arthur lived with her there. He was educated at the City of Oxford School and Balliol College, Oxford, gaining a First in Mathematics in 1891. He was a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford from 1891 to 1920, and was also an assistant tutor at Jesus College, Oxford from 1903 to 1920. He was then appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of London, retiring in 1936. He was made an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1931 and of Jesus College in 1934. For many years he was an external examiner in mathematical physics for the National University of Ireland (NUI).NUI Minutes of Senate, Vol XII He was known more for the high quality of his teaching than for mathematical research.

The not-for-profit NISP Foundation was founded in 1999 by the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast (with both Vice Chancellors, Gerry McKenna and George Bain being founding board members), along with representatives of the business community. Most initial funding came from UK government economic initiatives, with the intention that the park would become self-sustaining. It was planned that the Queen's Island site would eventually be occupied by twelve buildings, including an Innovation Centre for small tech firms and start-ups, the Queen's University Institute for Electronics, Communications and Information Technologies (ECIT), as well as larger companies and light manufacturing firms.

The film is one of Bardot's first film roles, at the age of 17, and was controversial for the scanty bikinis worn by the young Bardot in the film, one of the first occasions when a bikini had appeared in film and when the bikini was still widely considered immodest. Though released in France in 1953 as Manina, la fille sans voiles, the film was not released in the United States until 1958 as Manina, the Girl in the Bikini and in the United Kingdom until 1959 as The Lighthouse-Keeper's Daughter. In other countries it was released under other names. The film was able to be screened in the United States notwithstanding the Hays Code prohibition of exposure of the midriff as a foreign film. The film was shot in Cannes, Nice and Paris in the summer of 1952. Brigitte Bardot's father had signed a contract, on behalf of his minor daughter, specifying that the film was not to show indecent images.

Plot A 25-year-old Parisian student, G√©rard Morere (Calv√©), hears a lecture about a treasure Troilus lost at sea after the Peloponnesian War, and thinks he knows where it is, thanks to a discovery he made five years earlier when diving near the island of Levezzi, in Corsica. He gets friends and an innkeeper to invest in his dream, enough to get him to Tangiers where he convinces a cigarette smuggler, Eric (Vernon), to take him to the island. There they find 18-year-old Manina (Bardot), the light-keeper's daughter, who is beautiful and pure. Eric thinks G√©rard may have conned him, but G√©rard's belief in the treasure compels patience.

Location The Eco-city site is located 40 km from downtown Tianjin and 150 km from Beijing. The site is 10 km from the core district of the Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA), with the southern tip of the site only a 10-minute drive from the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA). The Eco-city is sited on non-arable land. Prior to development, the site of the Eco-city was one-third saltpan, one-third deserted beach, and one-third water, including a 270-hectare wastewater pond. Key features Green spaces will be interspersed throughout the city. Located in an area of low rainfall, the Eco- city will draw a significant part of its water supply from nontraditional sources such as desalinated water. Integrated waste management will be implemented in the Eco-city, with particular emphasis on the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste. A light-rail transit system, supplemented by a secondary network of trams and buses, will be the main mode of transportation in the Eco-city. This will help to reduce its carbon emissions. Social harmony will be a key feature of the Eco-city. An important instrument to achieve this will be subsidized public housing in the Eco-city, which will help to meet the housing needs of the lower and lower-middle income strata of society, and enable people of different income and social strata to live near to, and interact with, one another. The Eco-city will be barrier-free to cater to the needs of the elderly and the mobility-impaired. Public social and recreational facilities will be located within easy access of homes to meet residents‚Äô needs and provide opportunities for residents to interact. The development of the Eco-city will respect local heritage. The profile of the Ji Canal, which is 1,000 years old, will be retained. Two existing villages within the Eco- city site will also be conserved through adaptive reuse or partial rebuilding. Key Performance Indicators There is a set of 26 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city. In formulating these KPIs, reference is made to national standards in China and Singapore, as well as international standards. Some of the KPIs are listed below. The development of the start-up area and the entire Eco-city is targeted for completion by 2013 and 2020 respectively, and so reference is made to these years in the KPIs: *Ambient Air Quality - The air quality in the Eco-city should meet at least China‚Äôs National Ambient Air Quality Grade II Standard for at least 310 days per year. *Quality of Water from Taps - Water from all taps should be potable. *Carbon Emission Per Unit GDP - The carbon emission per unit GDP in the Eco- city should not exceed 150 ton-C per US$1 million. *Proportion of Green Buildings - All buildings in the Eco-city should meet green building standards. *Green Transportation - At least 90% of trips within the Eco-city should be in the form of \\"green trips\\" by 2020. (Green trips refer to trips via nonmotorized transport, i.e. cycling and walking, as well as trips on public transport.) *Barrier-Free Accessibility - The Eco-city should have 100% barrier-free access. *Proportion of Affordable Public Housing - At least 20% of housing in the Eco-city will consist of subsidized public housing by 2013. *Usage of Renewable Energy - Renewable energy should account for at least 15% of the energy utilized in the Eco-city by 2020. Possible sources of renewable energy for the Eco-city include geothermal energy, hydropower and solar power. *Usage of Water from Nontraditional Sources - At least 50% of the Eco-city‚Äôs water supply will be from nontraditional sources such as desalination and recycled water by 2020. *Jobs to be generated in the Eco-city - Sufficient jobs should be generated for at least 50% of the Eco-city‚Äôs residents within the Eco-city who are employable, to minimize the need for them to commute on a daily basis from their home to their workplace. Master plan The master plan of Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city was jointly developed by the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, the Tianjin Urban Planning and Design Institute, and the Singapore planning team led by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore. The intention is for development to take place around a central core of conserved ecological wetlands and rehabilitated water bodies. The main center of the Eco-city will be located on the southern bank of a historic thousand-year-old river course, which has been planned for a variety of uses, including commercial, cultural and recreational ones. A comprehensive green transport network, i.e., nonmotorized and public transport, will be developed in the Eco-city. A light rail transit system will serve as the main mode of transport. Commercial subcenters will be in each of the suburban areas to provide employment opportunities for the residents and reduce their need for commuting. There will be dedicated service industry parks, university and hospital sites in the Eco-city, which will contribute to the long-term economic vibrancy of the city in a sustainable manner. Groundbreaking ceremony The groundbreaking ceremony of the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city was held on 28 September 2008. Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao officiated at the event, signifying the beginning of construction work on the Eco-city.Quek, T.

He was the eldest of six children of Charles and Jean Black Milne. His father brought the family from Scotland to Monroe county NY about 1852 where they resided for a short time then removing to Holley Orleans county NY.

He also held an LL.D. degree in 1880, when, in March, that church and the First Presbyterian Church of Geneseo Village united to form the Presbyterian Church of Geneseo Village. He and the other elders of the two churches became the 12 elders of the united church, and in September he was elected as one of its 6 trustees, and also became one of three superintendents of its Sunday school. He continued as an elder and trustee at least into 1887. In 1889 Milne was succeeded as head of Geneseo Normal and Training School by his brother John M. Milne. In 1889 Milne took the presidency of New York State Normal School at Albany, overseeing development of its mission, as reflected in its name changes to New York State Normal College in 1890, and to New York State College for Teachers in 1914.

Kim B·ªìng woodworking village () is a village located in C·∫©m Kim commune, H·ªôi An, Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, most notable for its carpentry (including cabinet making and shipbuilding) and traditional woodworking products. Established in the 15th century, it reached its peak in the 18th century, during which time village craftsmen contributed their skills in woodworking to many different projects, including the Imperial capital in Hu·∫ø. Using their shipbuilding skills, they supplied ships and ghe b·∫ßu (large boats used for sailing) for the activities of the busy commercial port of H·ªôi An. To deal with a marked decline of interest in the woodworking profession during the 20th century, the village successfully offered training and other incentives to young apprentices, resulting in an increase to over 200 woodworkers and 18 different woodcarving companies as of 2008. Additionally, a successful community-based tourism project in Kim B·ªìng has allowed greater tourism revenue for the village; the venture's success has been suggested as a pattern for future sustainable tourism projects throughout Southeast Asia. The village's name comes from the Vietnamese kim (yellow) and b·ªìng (floating), supposedly after the jackfruit wood that sometimes floats on the Thu B·ªìn River.  History  Kim B·ªìng was settled in the 15th century, supposedly by four soldiers from the army of Emperor L√™ L·ª£i, who founded the Later L√™ Dynasty. According to traditional stories, these four soldiers were adept at woodworking, and went on to establish the village's four most notable craft families (Huynh, Nguyen, Phan, and Truong), many of whose members carry on that trade to the present day. As the neighbouring town of H·ªôi An developed during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Kim B·ªìng's carpenters and woodworkers became more widely known; in the 17th century, local carpenters were supposedly commissioned to build a warship for the Spanish navy. Craftsmen from Kim B·ªìng also produced most of the detail work on the buildings of the former Imperial capital in Hu·∫ø, and, more recently, on Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh's tomb. Alt URL In the present day, Kim B·ªìng craftsmen are often involved in restoration projects. For example, since the old town of H·ªôi An was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, many of the village's artisans have found work restoring historic buildings, some of which have remained otherwise untouched for hundreds of years. Local craftsmen have also worked on restoration projects in nearby Da Nang, and in Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province. Economy Kim B·ªìng wood carvings. As its popular appellation suggests, the economy of Kim B·ªìng has long been dominated by carpentry (including cabinetmaking and shipbuilding) and woodworking. Kim B·ªìng woodwork is featured on unique columns, rafters and furniture found throughout the greater H·ªôi An area and Qu·∫£ng Nam Province; local craftsmen have also been employed in many high- profile projects in Vietnam, including detail work on the buildings of the former Imperial capital in Hu·∫ø, and on Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh's tomb. In more recent years, woodworking as a profession fell out of favour with young people, mainly due to poor returns: the average income of a woodworker in Kim B·ªìng is about VND 1.5 million (US$85) per month. By the 1990s, few master carvers remained in the village. To help promote the profession, C·∫©m Kim commune created a program allowing young people to receive free training in carpentry and woodworking, along with providing a monthly stipend of VND 150,000 ($8) and tools of the trade. Training courses are provided by master carver Huynh Ri, whose family includes 12 generations of woodcarvers. Several other local woodworking studios also provide on-the-job training to apprentice woodcarvers. These training programs have resulted in an increase in skilled woodworkers: the village numbered over 200 workers and 18 different woodcarving companies as of 2008. These results were lauded by UNESCO as \\"keeping the traditional skills and intangible heritage of the town of Hoi An and its surrounding villages alive\\". Tourism is a more recent contributor to the local economy, beginning in 2002, when the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) led a community-based tourism project in Kim B·ªìng, together with UNESCO and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development/World Trade Organization's Export-led Poverty Reduction Programme (EPRP). The village was selected as a promising location for the project because of its proximity to H·ªôi An (already a major tourist destination), which provided an existing tourist base, and its existing craft sector. A dual pedestrian-bicycle trail was established to lead visitors through the village to see the local woodworking shops, where they are able to observe craftsmen working and purchase their products. Concurrent with the development of infrastructure, a tourism service cooperative was established, as well as a skills training program for members and a marketing program which resulted in market linkages with several major hotels and tour operators operating in H·ªôi An. Local and provincial tourism authorities have also incorporated the village into festivals and promotional campaigns. The success of the venture has led it to be considered a model case on which future sustainable tourism projects throughout Southeast Asia can be patterned.
