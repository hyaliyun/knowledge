The site was subsequently excavated by the antiquarians John Henry Middleton and William Bazeley. For two years the site lay open, during which time it was damaged by frost, rabbits, and visitors. In response to the damage, Emma Dent chose to partially rebuild the walls, up to 1.8 metres high in places on the east and south sides, and to reconstruct two of the remaining mosaics and cover them with wooden sheds. The huts had become ruinous by 1945, and in 1976 it was reported that \\"the sheds have now collapsed and the remains are suffering from weather and from the encroaching wood.\\" Finds from the excavations included a silver-plated bronze bowl, a large number of 3rd- and 4th-century coins, samian ware pottery, iron knives and tools.Spoonley Wood Roman villa, Pastscape, retrieved 19 April 2013 Most of the finds are at Sudeley Castle.

It is derived from xerocomic acid, which is preceded by atromentic acid and atromentin, and its genetic basis is unknown. In its oxidized form (due to the production of a second lactone ring) is variegatorubin, similar to xerocomorubin. It was first isolated from Suillus variegatus. It has strong antioxidant properties, and a nonspecific inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes. A total synthesis was reported in 2001 that uses a Suzuki cross coupling reaction. It was found antibiotically inactive against an array of bacteria and fungi using the disk diffusion assay at 50 Œºg..

Buddhism was in a way a result of the philosophical turmoil between the Brahmins and the Sramanas, as there was a large group of people who were dissatisfied with both groups and were looking for a more moderate religion that could appeal to people from most social backgrounds. The situation was just right for this new religion to spread and prosper. When Buddhism came to China, it was faced with a society that had deeply rooted Confucian ideals and mentality. The Chinese had an entirely different concept of the self which made the idea of enlightenment very different in their minds. Confucian values stress doing things for the good of the group over the individual, so dedicating most of one‚Äôs life for the purpose of achieving enlightenment was a completely foreign to Chinese thinkers and society as a whole. Philosophical Division in India In India, Buddhism emerged during a somewhat tumultuous time for the long-standing practices of Brahmanical Hinduism laid out in the Vedas and Upanishads. Shortly before the emergence of Buddhism a group of philosophical thinkers and holy men decided that they no longer bought into the often class based practices of the Vedas, and abandoned the old teachings and practices of the Brahmins. Renouncers, as they came to be known, rejected the authority of the Brahmin priests. They did not wish to live the rigid and highly structured lives laid out for priests. They no longer wished to be forced to be economically successful, and had grown tired of the Vedic sacrificial tradition. As almost as a form of protest against this religious tradition, they adopted a set of values and customs completely opposite of those preached by the Brahmin priests. They became celibate and nomadic, with some forming groups around great thinkers, while many others wandered alone. ‚ÄúMany also practised severe austerities, subjecting themselves to extremes of temperature, hunger and thirst, painful bodily distortions, and various other kinds of self-denial.‚ÄùHamilton, Sue. Indian Philosophy A Very Short Introduction. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. Birth of Buddhism It was during this time of the 5th century BCE that Siddhartha Gautama was born and devised his own way of teaching. His path to enlightenment lay somewhere between the two extremes; different from the lavish and structured lifestyle of Brahmin priesthood, as well as the harsh and isolated lifestyle of the renouncers. Because he took a sort of middle of the road approach in his own teachings, it became known as the Middle Path. At the time he started sharing his teachings, there was a good number of people that had grown tired of the extreme positions offered by the priests and renouncers, but were still dedicated to their faith and achieving enlightenment, and because of this his teachings were widely accepted. The teachings of Buddhism not only meshed well with the already deeply engrained philosophical views found in India at the time, but was in fact largely based on previous beliefs and slightly altered practices in response to a philosophically and religiously unstable time period. Introduction of Buddhism in China When Buddhism finally made its way into China, it faced a very different situation than it had in India. By the time of its arrival around the first century CE, China had already been under the influence of Confucianism for hundreds of years, which instilled the Chinese with a very different set of values and concepts than those found in India. Confucianism, while offering a set of practices to be a better person for your community, is a largely secular set of beliefs. This meant that although the ideas of Buddhism and Confucianism did not immediately mesh well, there was room for Buddhism to become another important religion in China alongside Taoism, the only other large scale religion practiced in China at the time. However, this proved not to be so simple. Buddhist teachings are largely focused on the individual self; directed at being aware of oneself and bettering oneself in order to achieve enlightenment of the self. This was a problem amongst Chinese thinkers and philosophers who had grown up in a Confucian society that stressed thinking of things as they relate to the group or family or community. The concept of enlightenment appeared to be a somewhat selfish goal in the minds of people whose understanding of the self was based more on relationships and interactions than on silent introspection.

(27 November 1883 - 30 April 1947) was a Catholic bishop who was Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika and later became Superior General of the White Fathers, or Society of Missionaries of Africa. Early years Joseph-Marie Birraux was born on 27 November 1883 in Bernex, France. He was ordained a priest of the Missionaries of Africa on 28 June 1908. In 1911 he was awarded a doctorate in canon law by the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. That year he was assigned to Karema in Tanganyika, where he served as canonical counselor to Adolphe Lechaptois, the Vicar Apostolic. Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika Birraux succeeded Lachaptois in 1920. He was appointed Titular Bishop of Ombi and Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika on 22 April 1920. He was ordained as bishop on 23 June 1920 by Bishop Pierre-Lucien Campistron. His achievements as Vicar Apostolic included ordaining the first two African priests in 1923, improving the standard of education of catechists and attempting to make Swahili the standard language of the vicariate. He also tried to make the church less dependent on external sources for funding by introducing a tax on church members. Birraux was succeeded as Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika by Jan Cornelius van Sambeek. Superior General of the White Fathers On 22 April 1936 Birraux was elected Superior General of the White Fathers. He succeeded Bishop Paul Voillard. In his first years Birraux visited White Fathers locations in Europe and Canada, and in Algeria, Tunisia, Sahara, West Africa and the Gold Coast (now Ghana). He reorganized the White Fathers into provinces aligned with national borders. In 1939 the Tanganyikan missions of Mbulu and Turu were ceded to the Pallottines. During World War II Birraux was opposed to the armistice between France and Germany. Despite the difficulties, from his base in Algiers he maintained contact with members of the society in France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, and also with missions in French Africa. Apart from Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon and Chad, all the French colonies in Africa remained loyal to Marshall P√©tain's right-wing and pro- Catholic Vichy regime rather than that of General Charles de Gaulle in London. General Weygand visited Birraux in Algiers in 1941 and gained assurance that he would support the Vichy regime. In 1943 the White Fathers assumed responsibility for the mission in Oyo, Nigeria. In 1946 the society assumed responsibility for the mission in Beira, Mozambique. Birraux suffered from hypertension, and required treatment several times during the war years. He underwent surgery twice in 1945. He died from a cerebral hemorrhage on 30 April 1947. He was succeeded as Superior General by Bishop Louis-Marie-Joseph Durrieu.

By , about 20,000 Soviet POWs had perished there from hunger, disease and executions. The camp was known at that time as the Stalag 359 Poniatowa. Afterwards, the Stammlager was redesigned an expanded as a concentration camp to provide slave labour supporting the German war effort, with workshops run by the SS Ostindustrie (Osti) on the grounds of the prewar Polish telecommunications equipment factory founded in the late 1930s.Micha≈Ç Ka≈∫mierczak, Poniatowa unofficial site with links to History and Gallery of photographs. Retrieved 19 April 2013. Location of Poniatowa factory: Poniatowa became part of the Majdanek concentration camp system of subcamps in the early autumn of 1943. The wholesale massacre of its mostly Jewish workforce took place during the Aktion Erntefest, thus concluding the Operation Reinhard in General Government. Camp operation Two years into the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, in October 1942 Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Amon G√∂th ‚Äì soon to become the commandant of Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w ‚Äì visited Poniatowa with a blueprint for redevelopment. The construction of a brand new forced labor camp was assigned to Erwin Lambert. The camp was meant to supply workers for the Walter T√∂bbens factory relocated from the vanishing Warsaw Ghetto, where at least 254,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka extermination camp in two months of summer 1942. Obersturmf√ºhrer Gottlieb Hering was appointed the camp commandant. He was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer by Himmler in March 1943. The first transport of Jews arrived at Poniatowa in October 1942 from Opole where the ghetto liquidation to Sobibor extermination camp was under way. The new barracks were built. By January 1943 there were 1,500 Jews in the camp. In April 1943, during the Nazi eradication of the Warsaw Ghetto, about 15,000 more Polish Jews were delivered. For the next six months, they all produced fresh garments for the Wehrmacht. Due to the nature of the work performed, the prisoners were not maltreated like in most other camps. They were allowed to keep children through daycare, wear their own clothes, and retain their personal effects, because the new uniforms made by them, were great morale boosters at the Front. The Jewish tailors and seamstresses of Warsaw worked practically free of charge for the German war profiteer Walter Caspar T√∂bbens (Toebbens) who was making a fortune. He was later described as the anti-Schindler. The Jews of Poland were augmented by around 3,000 Slovakian and Austrian Jews (the camp elite) housed separately from the rest.Alexander Donat, The Holocaust kingdom: a memoir (London, 1965), pp.216-217. Retrieved 19 April 2013 Aktion Reinhard After the closure of the nearby Belzec death factory in June 1943, head of the Operation Reinhard, Obergruppenf√ºhrer Odilo Globocnik inspected the Poniatowa facility in August 1943. Gottlieb Hering, the camp commandant, was reprimanded for a total lack of prison discipline. Drastic changes were introduced immediately with daily executions of at least several people. The new crematorium was constructed. From September 1943, the Poniatowa forced labor camp became part of the KL Majdanek concentration camp system of subcamps under Aktion Reinhard, the most deadly phase of the Holocaust. At the beginning of secretive Operation Harvest Festival (Aktion Erntefest) the inmates were ordered to dig anti-tank trenches at Poniatowa, Trawniki, as well as at the Majdanek concentration camps, unaware of their true purpose. On 3 November 1943, by the orders of Christian Wirth, the German SS and police began shooting Jews from the camps at these locations. They were massacred simultaneously across the entire Lublin Reservation with subcamps in Budzyn, Kra≈õnik, Pu≈Çawy, Lipowa and other places. At Poniatowa, the inmates were compelled to undress and enter the self-prepared trenches naked, where they were shot one-by-one over the bodies of others. The uprising On the first day of killings, in one of the barracks at Poniatowa Jews staged a revolt. To stamp it out the SS surrounded the building by a tight cordon, and set it on fire. The smoke triggered the arrival at the gate of a fire brigade from the village because gendarmes were not informed. According to witness, more than one structure was burning at the camp. The firemen were ordered by the screaming SS to leave immediately, but inadvertently noticed that a Jew running from the flames was bludgeoned with rifle butts, and thrown back into the burning building. The area was covered with bodies of women. The next morning (4 November 1943), mass killings at Poniatowa went on as planned and continued for the rest of the day. In total, on 3‚Äì4 November 1943 some 43,000 male and female prisoners were shot over a long line of fake anti-tank trenches. The camps were closed.

It was released by Warner Bros. on March 28, 1935. It is one of five films by Warner Bros. where Farrell and Blondell were paired as two blonde bombshells. The other films include: Havana Widows (1933), Kansas City Princess (1934), We're in the Money (1935) and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935). Actress Joan Blondell was married to the film's cinematographer George Barnes at the time of filming. Plot Angela Twitchell (Joan Blondell), the daughter of Rufus Twitchell (Grant Mitchell), the founder of Twitchell's Toothpaste, wants to work for her father's New York company. But her father is convinced that women have no place in the business. Rufus is losing sales to rival company own by Schmidts (Al Shean). but he is too stubborn to listen to any new ideas or mount a new advertising campaign. Angela tries to help her father by bringing him an idea for a cocktail flavored toothpaste. When he refuses to listen, she takes the idea to Schmidt, using an alias. Schmidt loves the idea and hires her to sell the product. Angela's first customer, Claudette (Glenda Farrell), the head of a chain of pharmacies, is committed to Twitchell's company, because she is in love with the company's salesman Pat O'Connor (William Gargan). On the road, Angela plans to outsell Pat. When she suspects that Pat is taking an early train in order to make a sale on board the train, she boards the train herself and beats him to the customer. Pat and Angela fall in love, but Pat does not know Angela's true identity. Back in New York, Pat and Rufus plan their strategy for the upcoming Chicago pharmacy convention, but once again, Angela uses every tactic to steal sales away from Twitchell's company. Pat accuses her of unethical behavior and refuses to see her again. Rufus and Schmidt discuss a merger, but negotiations are stalled until Angela shows up. Rufus is outraged that his own daughter has been working for his competitor. Then she reminds them that she only gave the rights to Cocktail Toothpaste to Schmidt for a year; she will only turn them over to a merged company. Later, Angela makes up with Pat.

Miss Blondell and Mr. Herbert have played their respective roles so often in the past that they probably don't need to read their scripts more than once. The photoplay presents most of the familiar faces in the Warner repertory group. The inventory includes Grant Mitchell as the conservative toothpaste magnate, Ruth Donnelly as his wife, Al Shean as his enterprising rival, Glenda Farrell as a fresh dame, and Bert Roach as a half-wit salesman who seems to be three sheets in the wind even when he hasn't been within miles of the Cocktail Toothpaste samples. They are all diverting enough in a rather familiar way.\\" Home media Warner Archive released a double feature DVD collection of Traveling Saleslady (1935) and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935) on April 5, 2012.

The car was based on second-hand Tatra 613-2 model, which was originally modified by AMK Narex (since 1992 Narimex) who specialized in rescue operations. This business had been set up by former racer, Cyril Svoboda, who was notorious for having adapted a Lancia Beta for rescue duties. In 1984, AMK Narex had produced six T-623. The success of the T-623 resulted in Tatra carrying out further modifications, in collaboration with Narex and Kovoslu≈æba rescue organizations. Because of the need of organizers for a car capable of keeping up with F1 cars on the opening race, the then T-623 was further developed into the 2-seat, lightweight and more powerful T-623 R. It led to a fleet of eight cars being used in Formula One as the safety cars at the inaugural 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix. The latest Hungarian Grand Prix that T-623 R took part in was held in 1995, where Taki Inoue was hit by the car.

Who by his Will bequeathed certain Lands and houses in Richmond in Trust for Charitable purposes\\". William Hickey, The renowned Richmond historian John Cloake says that very little is known about Hickey other than his generosity to the poor and the fact that he named trustees in his will to manage his bequests. According to Cloake, Hickey was a Roman Catholic (although he was buried at Richmond's Church of England parish church) and \\"the only one in Richmond to figure in a list of non-juror landowners in 1715\\". who died in 1727 and is buried in an altar tomb in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene, Richmond, left the income of several properties on Richmond Hill, including The Wick, in trust to provide pensions for six men and ten women. In 1822 the charity's funds were boosted by a major donation by Elizabeth Doughty. Twenty almshouses, designed by Lewis Vulliamy, in Neo-Tudor style with high chimneys, were built in 1834 from the trust's income. These are Grade II* listed and Historic England's listing also extends to the site's chapel (which is dedicated to St Francis), also built in 1834 and its two gate lodges. A later block of almshouses, built in 1851 in the same style as the main quadrangle, is listed at Grade II. The property, which includes another 29 buildings behind the almshouses, now consists of 49 flats and cottages, a laundry and a workshop. The almshouses are managed by The Richmond Charities.

The film follows Ad√®le (Exarchopoulos), a French teenager who discovers desire and freedom as an aspiring female painter Emma (Seydoux) enters her life. The film charts their relationship from Ad√®le's high school years to her early adult life and career as a school teacher. The premise of Blue Is the Warmest Colour is based on the 2010 graphic novel of the same name by Julie Maroh. Julie Maroh, Le bleu est une couleur chaude, Gl√©nat ‚Äì Hors collection, 2010, Production began in March 2012 and lasted six months. Approximately 800 hours of footage was shot, including extensive B-roll footage, with Kechiche ultimately trimming the final cut of the film down to 179 minutes. The film generated controversy upon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and before its release. Much of the controversy was about claims of poor working conditions on set by the crew and the lead actresses, and also the film's raw depiction of sexuality. At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the film unanimously won the Palme d'Or from the official jury and the FIPRESCI Prize. It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Seydoux and Exarchopoulos joining Jane Campion (The Piano) as the only women to have won the award. The film had its North American premiere at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Many critics declared it one of the best films of 2013.  Plot  Ad√®le is an introverted 17 year-old high-school student. While crossing the street one day, she passes by a woman with short blue hair and is instantly attracted. She later dates and sleeps with a boy from school named Thomas, but she is ultimately dissatisfied and breaks off their relationship. After having vivid fantasies about the woman she saw on the street and having one of her female friends kiss her, she becomes troubled about her sexual identity. Her best friend, the openly gay Valentin, seems to understand her confusion and takes her to a gay dance bar. After some time, Ad√®le leaves and walks into a lesbian bar, where she experiences assertive advances from some of the women. The blue-haired woman is also there and intervenes, claiming Ad√®le is her cousin to those pursuing Ad√®le. The woman is Emma, a graduating art student. They become friends and begin to spend more time with each other. Ad√®le's friends suspect her of being a lesbian and ostracise her at school. Despite the backlash, she becomes close to Emma. Their bond increases and before long, the two share a kiss at a picnic. They later have sex and begin a passionate relationship. Emma's artsy family is very welcoming to the couple, but Ad√®le tells her conservative, working-class parents that Emma is just a tutor for philosophy class. In the years that follow, the two women move in and live with each other. Ad√®le finishes school and joins the teaching staff at a local elementary school, while Emma tries to move forward with her painting career, frequently throwing house parties to socialise with her circle. At one of these, Ad√®le meets some of them: Lise, a pregnant woman and colleague, Joachim, \\"the biggest gallery owner in Lille\\", and Samir, an aspiring actor who feels out of place amongst the intellectuals, with whom she strikes up a friendship. Emma belittles Ad√®le's teaching career, encouraging her to find fulfilment in writing, while Ad√®le insists that she is happy the way she is. It gradually becomes increasingly apparent how little they have in common, and emotional complexities manifest in the relationship. Out of loneliness and confusion Ad√®le sleeps with Antoine, a male colleague. Emma becomes aware of the fling and furiously confronts Ad√®le and, refusing her tearful apologies, breaks up with her and throws her out. Time passes and although Ad√®le finds satisfaction in her job as a kindergarten teacher, she still cannot overcome her heartbreak. The two eventually meet again in a restaurant. Ad√®le is still deeply in love with Emma and despite the powerful connection that is clearly still there between them, Emma is now in a committed partnership with Lise, who now has a young daughter. Ad√®le is devastated, but holds it in. Emma admits that she does not feel sexually fulfilled but has accepted it as a part of her new phase in life. She reassures Ad√®le that their relationship was special, and she will always have \\"infinite tenderness\\" for her. The two part on amicable terms. Later, Ad√®le goes to Emma's new art exhibition. Hanging on one wall is a nude painting that Emma once did of her during the sensual bloom of their life together. Though Emma acknowledges her, her attention is primarily on the gallery's other guests and Lise. Ad√®le congratulates Emma on the success of her art and leaves quietly after a brief conversation with Samir. He chases after her but heads in the wrong direction, while Ad√®le walks away into the distance.

However, the film's treatment of lesbian sexuality has been questioned by academics, due to its being directed from a straight, male perspective. In Sight & Sound, film scholar Sophie Mayer suggests that in Blue is the Warmest Colour, \\"Like homophobia, the lesbian here melts away. As with many male fantasies of lesbianism, the film centers on the erotic success and effective failures of relations between women\\".Review: Blue is the Warmest Colour. Sight and Sound. Retrieved 18 February 2015. The issue of perspective has also been addressed in a Film Comment review by Kristin M. Jones, who points out that \\"Emma's supposedly sophisticated friends make eager remarks about art and female sexuality that seem to mirror the director's problematic approach toward the representation of women\\".Review: Blue Is the Warmest Color. Film Comment. Retrieved 19 February 2015.  Social class  One recurring thematic element addressed by critics and audiences is the division of social class and the exploration of freedom and love between the two central characters, Ad√®le and Emma. The reference to social class is juxtaposed between the two dinner table scenes in the film, with Ad√®le's conservative, working-class family engaging in discussion over comparatively banal subjects to Emma's more open-minded, middle-class family, who focus their discussion primarily on more existential matters: art, career, life and passion. Perhaps one of the most significant differences between Ad√®le's and Emma's families is that Emma's is aware of their lesbian relationship, while Ad√®le's conservative parents are under the impression the women are just friends. Some critics have noted that the difference of social class is an ongoing theme in Kechiche's filmography: \\"As in Kechiche's earlier work, social class, and the divisions it creates, are a vital thread; he even changed the first name of the story's passionate protagonist from Cl√©mentine to that of his actress, partly because it means \\"justice\\" in Arabic. His fascination and familiarity with the world of pedagogy, as shown here in Ad√®le's touching reverence for teaching, is another notable characteristic\\", was noted by a Film Comment critic.  Food  Kechiche explores how food can evoke varying levels of symbolism, for instance through the sexually suggestive food metaphors of Ad√®le's liking of the fat on ham and her learning to eat oysters from Emma. Additionally, he looks at how food can be seen as an indicator of social class.  Production   Adaptation  Director and screenwriter Abdellatif Kechiche developed the premise for Blue Is the Warmest Colour while directing his second feature film, Games of Love and Chance (2003). He met teachers \\"who felt very strongly about reading, painting, writing\\" and it inspired him to develop a script which charts the personal life and career of a female French teacher. However, the concept was only finalized a few years later when Kechiche chanced upon Julie Maroh's graphic novel, and he saw how he could link his screenplay about a school teacher with Maroh's love story between two young women. Although Maroh's story takes precedence in the adaptation, Ad√®le's character, named \\"Cl√©mentine\\" in the book, differs from the original as explored by Charles Taylor in The Yale Review: \\"The novel includes scenes of the girls being discovered in bed and thrown out of the house and speeches like What's horrible is that people kill each other for oil and commit genocide, not that they give their love to someone.\\"Taylor, Charles. \\"Film in Review.\\" The Yale Review Volume 102, Issue 3, Article first published online: 19 June 2014. In the film, Ad√®le's parents are seemingly oblivious to her love affair with Emma and politely greet her under the impression that she is Ad√®le's philosophy tutor. Further themes are explored in Maroh's novel, such as addiction to prescription pills. Regarding his intention to portray young people, Kechiche claimed: \\"I almost wish I was born now, because young people seem to be much more beautiful and brighter than my generation. I want to pay them tribute.\\"  Casting  In late 2011, a casting call was held in Paris to find the ideal actress for the role of Ad√®le. Casting director Sophie Blanvillain first spotted Ad√®le Exarchopoulos and then arranged for her to meet Abdellatif Kechiche. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted of improvisation of scenarios, discussions, and also of them both sitting in a caf√©, without talking, while he quietly observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film; as he said in an interview, \\"I chose Ad√®le the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie. She ordered lemon tart and when I saw the way she ate it I thought, 'It's her!'\\" On the other hand, L√©a Seydoux was cast for the role of Emma, ten months before principal photography began in March 2012. Kechiche felt that Seydoux \\"shared her character's beauty, voice, intelligence and freedom\\" and that she has \\"something of an Arabic soul\\". He added on saying, \\"What was decisive during our meeting was her take on society: She's very much tuned in to the world around her. She possesses a real social awareness, she has a real engagement with the world, very similar to my own. I was able to realise to how great an extent, as I spent a whole year with her between the time she was chosen for the role and the end of shooting.\\" Speaking to IndieWire on the preparation for her role, Seydoux said \\"During those ten months (before shooting) I was already meeting with him (Kechiche) and being directed. We would spend hours talking about women and life; I also took painting and sculpting lessons, and read a lot about art and philosophy.\\"  Filming  The film, originally planned to be shot in two and a half months, was shot in five months, from March to August 2012 with a budget of ‚Ç¨4 million. Seven hundred and fifty hours of dailies were shot.\\"La Vie d'Ad√®le\\", la Palme de l'√©motion ‚Äì letemps.ch Shooting took place in Lille as well as Roubaix and Li√©vin. In terms of cinematography, the shot reverse shot scenes in the film were simultaneously shot with two different cameras. For Kechiche, this technique not only facilitates editing but also adds beauty to the scene which feels more truthful.Interview with Abdellatif Kechiche. Cahiers du Cinema. Octobre 2013. pp. 10-16 Another characteristic aspect of Blue's cinematography is the predominance of close-ups. Cinematographer Sofian El Fani used the Canon EOS C300 camera with Ang√©nieux zoom lenses, and the entire production was undertaken in a digital workflow.. \\"'The film was shot with a Canon C300 digital camera, and the entire production was completed in a fully digital workflow.'

Controversies 227x227px Upon its premiere at the 2013 Cannes Festival, a report from the French Audiovisual and Cinematographic Union (Syndicat des professionnels de l'industrie de l'audiovisuel et du cin√©ma) criticised the working conditions from which the crew suffered. According to the report, members of the crew said the production occurred in a \\"heavy\\" atmosphere with behavior close to \\"moral harassment,\\" which led some members of the crew and workers to quit. Further criticism targeted disrupted working patterns and salaries. Technicians accused director Abdellatif Kechiche of harassment, unpaid overtime, and violations of labor laws.Pol√©mique autour du tournage de la ¬´Vie d'Ad√®le¬ª, La Croix, 29 May 2013. In September 2013, the two main actresses, L√©a Seydoux and Ad√®le Exarchopoulos, also complained about Kechiche's behaviour during the shooting. They described the experience as \\"horrible,\\" and said they would not work with him again. Exarchopoulos later said about the rift: \\"No, it was real, but it was not as big as it looks. For me, a shoot is a human adventure, and in every adventure you have some conflict.\\" In an interview in January 2014, Seydoux clarified: \\"I'm still very happy with this film. It was hard to film it and maybe people think I was complaining and being spoiled, but that's not it. I just said it was hard. The truth is it was extremely hard but that's OK. I don't mind that it was hard. I like to be tested. Life is much harder. He's a very honest director and I love his cinema. I really like him as a director. The way he treats us? So what!\\" In September 2013, Kechiche stated that the film should not be released. Speaking to French magazine T√©l√©rama, Kechiche said \\"I think this film should not go out; it was too sullied\\", referring to the negative press about his on- set behaviour. Style The film portrays Adele and Emma's relationship with an overarching sense of realism. The camerawork, along with many of Kechiche's directorial decisions allow a true-to-life feel for the film, which in turn has led to audiences reading the film with meaning that they can derive from their own personal experiences. In The Yale Review, Charles Taylor puts this into words: \\"Instead of fencing its young lovers within a petting zoo... Kechiche removes the barriers that separate us from them. He brings the camera so close to the faces of his actresses that he seems to be trying to make their flesh more familiar to us than his own.\\"Everybody's Adolescence \\"The Yale Review\\". Retrieved 19 February 2015.  Significance of the colour blue  Blue Is the Warmest Colour is also filled with visual symbolism. The colour blue is used extensively throughout the film‚Äîfrom the lighting in the gay club Ad√®le visits, to the dress she wears in the last scene and most notably, in Emma's hair and eyes. For Ad√®le, blue represents emotional intensity, curiosity, love, and sadness. Ad√®le also references Pablo Picasso a number of times, who famously went through a melancholy Blue Period. As Emma grows out of her relationship with Ad√®le and their passion wanes, she removes the blue from her hair and adopts a more natural, conservative hairstyle.  Music  Reviewer Spencer Wolff noted the political stance adopted by Ad√®le, which changes as her life experiences change and reflect her alternating views: \\"Blue is the Warmest Colour is no different; at least, at first. Framed by black and Arab faces, Ad√®le marches in a protest to demand better funding for education. The music, \\"On l√¢che rien\\" (\\"We will never give up!\\"), by the Algerian-born Kaddour Haddadi, is the official song of the French Communist Party. Yet, soon after she begins her relationship with Emma, we see Ad√®le marching again, hip-to-hip with her new lover, at a gay pride parade.\\"  Distribution  Lead actresses L√©a Seydoux and Ad√®le Exarchopoulos and producer Vincent Maraval accepting the award for Best Film at the 19th Lumi√®res Awards.

Critical response  On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 193 reviews with a weighted average of 8.15/10. The site's critical consensus is: \\"Raw, honest, powerfully acted, and deliciously intense, Blue Is the Warmest Colour offers some of modern cinema's most elegantly composed, emotionally absorbing drama.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 89 averaged from 55 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". More than 40 critics named the film as one of the ten best of 2013. In 2016, the film was named as the 45th best film of the 21st century, from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world. In France Les Cahiers du cin√©ma placed the film third in their 2013 Top Ten chart. In The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin awarded the film a maximum of five stars and tipped it to win the Palme d'Or. He wrote: \\"Kechiche's film is three hours long, and the only problem with that running time is that I could have happily watched it for another seven. It is an extraordinary, prolonged popping-candy explosion of pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope, and contained within it ‚Äì although only just ‚Äì are the two best performances of the festival, from Ad√®le Exarchopoulos and L√©a Seydoux.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw added that \\"it is genuinely passionate film-making\\" and changed his star rating for the film to five out of five stars after previously having awarded it only four. Stephen Garrett of The New York Observer said that the film was \\"nothing less than a triumph\\" and \\"is a major work of sexual awakening\\". Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \\"Not unlike Wong Kar-wai's most matured effort in cinema, Happy Together, director Abdellatif Kechiche knows love and relationship well and the details he goes about everything is almost breathtaking to endure. There is a scene in the restaurant where two meet again, after years of separation, the tears that dwell on their eyes shows precisely how much they love each other, yet there is no way they will be together again. Blue Is the Warmest Colour is likely to be 2013's most powerful film and easily one of the best.\\" =Concerns about graphic sex= At Cannes, the film shocked some critics with its long and graphic sex scenes (although fake genitalia were used),Cannes 2013 : les sc√®nes les plus sexe du Festival ‚Äì Le Figaro leading them to state that the film may require some editing before it is screened in cinemas. Several critics placed the film as the front-runner to win the Palme d'Or. The judging panel, which included Steven Spielberg, Ang Lee, and Nicole Kidman, made an unprecedented move to award the Palme d'Or to the film's two main actresses along with the director. Jury President Steven Spielberg explained: Justin Chang, writing for Variety, said that the film contains \\"the most explosively graphic lesbian sex scenes in recent memory\\". Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter said that despite being three hours long, the film \\"is held together by phenomenal turns from L√©a Seydoux and newcomer Ad√®le Exarchopoulos, in what is clearly a breakout performance\\". Writing in The Australian, David Stratton said, \\"If the film were just a series of sex scenes it would, of course, be problematic, but it's much, much more than that. Through the eyes of Ad√®le we experience the breathless excitement of first love and first physical contact, but then, inevitably, all the other experiences that make life the way it is ... All of these are beautifully documented\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described the film as \\"wildly undisciplined\\" and overlong, and wrote that it \\"feels far more about Mr. Kechiche's desires than anything else\\". Conversely, Richard Brody, writing in The New Yorker about \\"Sex Scenes That Are Too Good\\", stated: \\"The problem with Kechiche's scenes is that they're too good‚Äîtoo unusual, too challenging, too original‚Äîto be assimilated ... to the familiar moviegoing experience. Their duration alone is exceptional, as is their emphasis on the physical struggle, the passionate and uninhibited athleticism of sex, the profound marking of the characters' souls by their sexual relationship.\\" = LGBT and feminist response = The film received LGBT and feminist critical comment for the perceived dominance of the male gaze and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a \\"patriarchal gaze.\\" After a test screening of selected scenes for a lesbian audience, one viewer commented that it was \\"hot at the beginning, and then it got ridiculous when they kept switching sex positions every ten seconds\\" and that it was like an infomercial designed to address all of the sexual acts that lesbians can engage in. The depiction of scissoring was also debated. Julie Maroh, the author of the graphic novel upon which the film was based, said, \\"It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians.\\" Although Maroh praised Kechiche's originality, describing his adaptation as \\"coherent, justified and fluid ... a masterstroke\\", they also felt that he failed to capture the lesbian heart of their story, and disapproved of the sex scenes. In a blog post, they called the scenes, \\"a brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold, of so-called lesbian sex, which turned into porn, and made me feel very ill at ease\\", saying that in the movie theatre, \\"the hetero-normative laughed because they don't understand it and find the scene ridiculous. The gay and queer people laughed because it's not convincing, and found it ridiculous. And among the only people we didn't hear giggling were the potential guys too busy feasting their eyes on an incarnation of their fantasies on screen\\". They added that \\"as a feminist and lesbian spectator, I cannot endorse the direction Kechiche took on these matters. But I'm also looking forward to hearing what other women will think about it. This is simply my personal stance.\\"  Accolades  2014 C√©sar Awards The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The actresses were also given the Palme as a special prize. Kechiche dedicated the award to \\"the youth of France\\" and the Tunisian Revolution, where \\"they have the aspiration to be free, to express themselves and love in full freedom\\". At Cannes it also won the FIPRESCI Prize. In addition, this was also the first film adapted from either a graphic novel or a comic to win the Palme d'Or. In December 2013, it received the Louis Delluc Prize for best French film. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. At the 39th C√©sar Awards, the film received eight nominations with Exarchopoulos winning the C√©sar Award for Most Promising Actress.

Maturana also was an academic at Andr√©s Bello National University, and was the President of the Rancagua chapter of the College of Teachers of Chile (). Biography Ren√© Gabriel Maturana Maldonado was born on 10 February 1955. Mayor of Pichilemu Maturana worked in the O'Higgins regional offices of the Government General Secretariat Ministry until he was appointed Mayor of Pichilemu by the government --set by a coup d'√©tat in 1973-- of President Augusto Pinochet Ugarte on 31 August 1984, to replace Emilio Merino Lacoste. Maturana Maldonado was the last mayor to be appointed by the Pinochet military regime, which remained in power until 1990. Former councilor of Pichilemu Washington Sald√≠as noted in an article published on Pichilemu News following Maturana's death, that his mayorship was \\"marked by significant advances in almost all areas, and whose value was that they were all performed with municipal resources.\\" Sald√≠as also noted that Maturana's work, \\"although [made] with low municipal budgets, will be remembered as one of the best mayorships [in Pichilemu].\\" Through his first year as mayor of Pichilemu, his government spent 17 million pesos making improvements to the Costanera Cardenal Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro Avenue (Avenida Costanera Cardenal Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro), the municipal stadium --including the construction of an athletic track, Olympic grid--, announced plans to supply electricity to the Santa Teresita, Ram√≥n Freire and Jorge Err√°zuriz streets and nearby neighborhoods, supplied with telephone, television, and mail services to the villages of C√°huil and Ciruelos, made minor repairs to the municipal forest, and repaired the municipal gymnasium. Also during his first year as mayor, the local hospital (Hospital de Pichilemu) was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by President Augusto Pinochet, and in later years, Maturana created the municipal boarding school, paved the Costanera Avenue --which borders the coast of Pichilemu--, created the Arturo Prat Square near Playa Principal, financed the re-modelling of the Agust√≠n Ross Park, which was re- inaugurated with celebrations on 13 December 1987, and created the newspaper El Pichilemino, directed by F√©lix Calder√≥n; the newspaper circulated between 1985 and 1986. Maturana founded public schools in Pueblo de Viudas, Infiernillo, Alto Ram√≠rez, and El Potrero --in current Paredones--, which were inaugurated simultaneously in 1988. In 1989, he created the Public Library of Pichilemu, which is now hosted at the Agust√≠n Ross Cultural Center. Additionally, the former casino created by Agust√≠n Ross Edwards and its adjacent park were declared National Monuments of Chile. He also created several music festivals for Pichilemu, bringing artists like Miriam Hern√°ndez, and Luis Jara to local scenarios. He was confirmed in the office by the Region of O'Higgins Development Council on 16 October 1989, which decided that Maturana would remain Mayor of Pichilemu for \\"good service\\" reasons. Maturana Maldonado resigned as mayor of Pichilemu in April 1992, and Gustavo Parraguez Galarce, municipal secretary, was named acting mayor of Pichilemu; he held office until the first municipal election since the return to democracy saw Orlando Cornejo Bustamante elected mayor of the commune. His mayorship has been qualified as \\"the golden years of the commune of Pichilemu.\\" Later life After he resigned as Mayor of Pichilemu, he worked as journalist for the Rancagua-based newspaper El Rancag√ºino, and as a professor at Andr√©s Bello National University and its institute, AIEP. He also worked as Public Relations official for FUSAT (Fundaci√≥n de Salud El Teniente, El Teniente Health Foundation), and was also President of the O'Higgins regional chapter of the College of Journalists of Chile (Colegio de Periodistas de Chile) for almost a decade. Illness and death In 2008, his health condition suddenly worsened, and was affected by a peritonitis and a \\"severe metastasis\\" caused by the removal of one kidney one year before. He was admitted at the Intensive Care Unit at Cl√≠nica FUSAT in Rancagua in May 2008, and underwent surgery on the 14th of that month. His condition was described by his doctor as being in \\"serious condition and in danger of death because of septicemia complications.\\" His condition improved by July 2008. However, he fell ill again by July 2009; local newspaper El Expreso de la Costa said at the time: \\"the life of a great former mayor of Pichilemu is getting shut down.\\" He was diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on 12 August 2009 at 09:00 local time in Rancagua, Chile. A mass was conducted by Father Bernab√© Silva --cura p√°rroco (priest of the parish of Pichilemu) through Maturana's term-- at the Iglesia del Divino Maestro in Rancagua, which was attended by relatives, people from Pichilemu, politicians from Rancagua including mayor Eduardo Soto, amid others. was buried at the Parque Jard√≠n de las Flores, in the commune of Machal√≠, on the following day. Personal life Ren√© Maturana and family, circa 1988.

It premiered on 18 May 2013 at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or. After the screening, the audience welcomed the film with a ten- minute standing ovation, and director Kore-eda and Fukuyama were moved to tears. In 25 May 2013 ceremony, it won the Jury Prize and a commendation from the Ecumenical Jury. The award sparked a significant response in Japan, and the national theatrical release was brought forward by a week, on 28 September 2013.

Plot Ry≈çta Nonomiya is a successful architect who is focused so much on work that he neglects his wife, Midori, and son, Keita. Upon his return home one day, Midori tells him that the hospital where Keita was born urgently needs to speak to them, and Ry≈çta senses trouble. After arriving at the hospital, the couple learns that their biological son Ry≈´sei was switched with Keita at birth, and after DNA tests prove the error, they must now make a life-changing decision to either keep Keita, the boy they raised as their own son, or exchange him for their biological son. Ry≈çta and Midori soon meet with the other couple, Yukari and Y≈´dai Saiki, small town folks who lack the money and drive that Ry≈çta possess, but who have a better understanding of the importance of child and parent bonds. They share photos, and for the first time, Ry≈çta and Midori see their biological son, Ry≈´sei. After several meetings, they decide to exchange children for one Saturday. After several more meetings, they finally decide to exchange children permanently. All four parents have difficulty accepting the loss of their previous sons, and the absence of the parents they used to know causes both boys to shut down emotionally, culminating in Ry≈´sei running away from the Nonomiya's home and returning to the Saiki's. Ry≈çta picks up Ry≈´sei and brings him back home. Ry≈çta and Midori begin to bond with Ry≈´sei, who is also warming up to them. However, while going through the photos on his camera, Ry≈çta discovers a cache of photos of himself, mostly sleeping, that Keita took, and he breaks down crying. Ry≈çta now understands the errors of his ways. The three return to the Saiki family, but Keita runs away from Ry≈çta. While following him, Ry≈çta apologizes to Keita, and the two make amends. The film ends with the two returning to the Saiki's, and both families entering the home.

These two families, as Mark Kermode notes on The Observer, are faced with the dilemma of retaining the children they have raised, on the basis of the bonds built with them over six years, or swap them and start over for the sake of blood lineage continuity. Southern emphasizes Ry≈çta's transformation in dealing with this difficult choice: he is first convinced to make the swap, believing that the affinities with his biological son will emerge increasingly evident in the future. However, after several encounters with the Saiki family and the confrontations with Y≈´dai, who advises him not to neglect his family life, and after discovering photographs of him shot by Keita while he was asleep, he acknowledges his emotional bond with him. Southern recalls two key sequences of the film, commenting that \\"Kore-eda has a poet's eye for human nuance\\": in the first scene, where Ry≈çta reviews Keita's snapshots, he remarks that Ry≈çta \\"discover[s] a part of himself that he never knew existed\\"; in the second one, where the two families casually pose together for a group photo, he witnesses how \\"we can see the differences not merely between the clans‚Äîone rigid and ascetic, one loose, emotionally free, and unrestricted‚Äîbut between traditional and more modern Japanese conceptions of family.\\" David Cirone of J-Generation brings up the personal theme of balancing social norms with individual freedom, noting that Ry≈çta is \\"torn between his own expectations, those of his wife and family, and the mixed suggestions of those around him who all seem to know what's best for him and the children.\\" Reception  Box office  In the opening weekend, the film topped the national ranking with 253,370 spectators and grossing ¬•313.3 million. The film maintained the first position for two consecutive weeks, with 1,168,204 spectators and a box office revenue of ¬•1.35 billion ($13.87 million in 2013) in the first 13 days, including pre-release days. It exceeded a revenue of ¬•3 billion on 11 November, the 49th day of release, an uncommon achievement for an art film. The final domestic box office revenue reported in January 2014 was ¬•3.2 billion ($30 million).  Critical response  Like Father, Like Son received mostly positive reviews. On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 87% approval score, with an average rating of 7.61/10 based on 100 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"Sensitively written, smartly directed, and powerfully performed, Like Father, Like Son uses familiar-seeming elements to tell a thought-provoking story.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \\"Essentially, Like Father, Like Son is one of those rare films that keep the audience totally engaged, thoroughly profound, fully emoted and ultimately refreshing. In the scale of perfect cinema, this stands quite close.\\" On the website of The American Spectator, Eve Tushnet wrote that the film \\"has some of the striking Kore-eda trademarks: the extraordinary acting from the children; the symmetrical framing and musical pacing; and the shifts between long shots in which all the people look tiny and child's-eye shots where all the people look huge.\\" Remake DreamWorks Studios has acquired remake rights to Like Father, Like Son after the film caught the eye of Steven Spielberg at Cannes.

It was found using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. It is likely to have an equilibrium temperature slightly higher than the surface temperature of Venus (around ), high enough to melt some types of metal. Its stellar flux is 70 ¬± 9 times Earth's. Characteristics Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-62b is a super-Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass bigger than Earth, but smaller than that of the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. It has an equilibrium temperature of . This is hot enough to melt some types of metal. It has a radius of 1.3 , placing it below the estimated radius of ‚â§1.6 where it would otherwise be a mini-Neptune with a volatile composition, with no solid surface.https://astrobites.org/2014/07/31/most-1-6-earth-radius-planets- are-not-rocky/ However, the mass is currently not known, estimates place an upper limit of <9 , the real mass is expected to be significantly lower than this. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-62, orbited by a total of five planets, of which Kepler-62f has the longest orbital period. The star has a mass of 0.69 and a radius of 0.64 . It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.65. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-62b orbits its host star with an orbital period of 5 days at a distance of about 0.05 AU (compared to same distance as Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). It receives 70 times as much sunlight than Earth does from the Sun. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-62; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-62b occurred roughly every 5 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 5-day transits. The discovery, along with the planetary system of the star Kepler-69 were announced on April 18, 2013.

The second son of Edward Francis Harrison of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), he was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford. He entered the ICS in 1884, initially serving in the Executive in Bengal, after five years he moved to the financial department in Calcutta. He rose to be Comptroller, Auditor-General, and Head Commissioner of Paper Currency. He was made a Companion of the Star of India in 1909. He retired and returned to the United Kingdom in 1911. He entered politics in 1916 when he was co-opted onto the London County Council to fill a Municipal Reform Party vacancy on the aldermanic bench in place of Cyril Jackson, who had resigned. He served until 1922. The Municipal Reformers were the majority party on the council, closely allied to the national Conservative Party. Harrison was appointed chairman of the council's finance committee, but resigned the position in March 1922 as he disagreed with his party over \\"the matter of economy\\". He condemned the council for what he called \\"excessive expenditure on housing and in other directions\\". Following his resignation he authored an article in The Times calling for the government to make deep cuts in spending. At the 1922 general election he was elected as Conservative Party member of parliament for Lambeth, Kennington. He was also supported by the Anti-Waste League. He stood down from parliament when a further general election was held in 1923. He never married and died at his home, \\"White Hall\\", Syderstone, Norfolk, in 1938, aged 75.

It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, with Jia winning the award for Best Screenplay. Stars of the film include Zhao Tao, Jia's wife and longtime collaborator. Plot The film is set in present-day China, and is based on recent events in China's contemporary history. In addition, the film draws on the history of wuxia stories. The title in Chinese, Â§©Ê≥®ÂÆö (Tian zhuding) is literally translated as \\"heavenly fate\\" or \\"fated doom,\\" while its English title is a reference to King Hu's 1971 action epic A Touch of Zen, one of the most influential wuxia films. It revolves around four threads set in vastly different geographical and social milieus across modern-day China, ranging from the bustling southern metropolis of Guangzhou and Dongguan to the more rural townships in Jia's home province of Shanxi. The stories are loosely based on: #Hu Wenhai (2001) #Zhou Kehua (2004-2012) #Deng Yujiao incident (2009) #Foxconn suicides (2007-2013) Reception  Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 94% based on reviews from 83 critics. The site's consensus states, \\"Its screenplay isn't as graceful as the choreography of its action sequences, but A Touch of Sin offers enough stylishly satisfying violence to muscle past its rough spots.\\" A Touch of Sin was well-received at Cannes, with some critics calling its genre elements, including scenes of graphic violence, a stylistic departure from some of Jia's past works, known for quiet realism and surreal visions of contemporary China. Dennis Lim of the Los Angeles Times notes that although the style may be different, the disturbing themes of the film built on the social criticism in Jia's earlier work. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the film saying \\"it has the urgency of a screaming headline but one inscribed with visual lyricism, emotional weight and a belief in individual rights\\". In 2017, A Touch of Sin was chosen by The New York Times as one of the 25 best films of the 21st century. Release Although Jia's films have been officially released in China since 2004's The World, his earlier works were made independent of government censors and were thus never publicly released in cinemas. In May 2013 it was announced that the film had been cleared for release in mainland China with a release date of 9 November, a surprise to observers within and outside the country who feared such subject matter was taboo. By December 2013 the film still had not been cleared by censors.

History  The church history began from three separately independent churches in Singkawang, Pontianak, and Pemangkat. All of them are in West Borneo, at that time part of Dutch East Indies. The Singkawang Congregation was founded in the early 20th century, in the year 1906, by American evangelical missionary Charles M. Worthington. Then in 1928 the church got assistance from Basel Mission. The Pontianak Congregation, started in 6 June 1935 by some Christians who came from China. This church then get assistance from Chinese missionaries. During the Japanese occupation, the Chinese people in West Borneo, especially the Christians faced persecution. During this time multiple churches were forced to be closed and a reverend was killed. After the end of World War II in 1950 the church received assistance from missionaries of China Inland Mission (now OMF International). The Pemangkat Congregation was founded by some Christians who moved to Pemangkat. In the beginning they just conducted worship at a house. Finally with the help from missionaries who came to Pemangkat in the 1950s, the Pemangkat Church building was officially built in 1963. These three churches then extend their evangelical mission to the surrounding areas, and built new churches in many towns and villages of West Borneo. In 1966 the three main churches, along with other churches affiliated with them, agreed to merge and found a church organization which was named Chinese Christian Church (Hanzi: ‰∏≠ËèØÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÊúÉ, Teochew dialect: Tiong Hua Kie Tok Kauw Hwee), with the Pontianak Congregation as the center of synod. Facing the political and social turbulence in Indonesia (Indonesian killings of 1965‚Äì66 while in the Transition to the New Order), then at the great plenary session in 1967, the synod decided to change the church name to West Kalimantan Christian Church (Chinese: Ë•øÂä†Âü∫Áù£ÊïôÊúÉ, Indonesian: Gereja Kristen Kalimantan Barat), abbreviated as GKKB. On 2 July 1988, the GKKB synod became a member of Council of Churches in Indonesia (CCI).Daftar Anggota PGI  Congregations and Evangelism Posts  This is a list of the West Kalimantan Christian Church congregations and evangelism posts (EP), grouped by cities and regencies:  Pontianak City  # Pontianak Congregation (location: South Pontianak District) # Jeruju Congregation (location: West Pontianak District) # Purnama Congregation (location: South Pontianak District) # Siantan Congregation (location: North Pontianak District) # Sungai Selamat EP (location: North Pontianak District) # Parit Pangeran EP (location: North Pontianak District) # Purnama Hijau EP (location: South Pontianak District)  Great Kubu (Kubu Raya) Regency  # Parit Baru Congregation (location: Parit Baru Village, Sungai Raya District) # Sungai Raya Dalam EP (location: Sungai Raya Dalam Village, Sungai Raya District) # Kakap EP (location: Sungai Kakap Village, Sungai Kakap District) # Kumpai Kecil EP (location: Kuala Dua Village, Sungai Raya District) # Kumpai Besar EP (location: Sungai Ambangah Village, Sungai Raya District) # Punggur EP (location: Punggur Kecil Village, Sungai Kakap District) # Kalimas EP (location: Kalimas Village, Sungai Kakap District) # Ambawang EP (location: Sungai Ambawang Village, Sungai Ambawang District)  Mempawah Regency  # Mempawah Congregation (location: Mempawah Hilir District) # Segedong Congregation (location: Segedong District) # Sungai Pinyuh Congregation (location: Sungai Pinyuh District) # Semudun Congregation (location: Sungai Kunyit District) # Jungkat EP (location: Jungkat Village, Siantan District) # Sungai Purun EP (location: Sungai Purun Kecil Village, Sungai Pinyuh District) # Peniraman EP (location: Peniraman Village, Sungai Pinyuh District) # Kampung Suap (Suap Village) EP (location: Suap Orchard, Pasir Village, Mempawah Hilir District)  Singkawang City  # Singkawang Congregation (location: West Singkawang District) # Lirang EP (location: South Singkawang District) # Roban EP (location: Central Singkawang District) # Kopisan EP (location: South Singkawang District) # Sijangkung EP (location: South Singkawang District) # Sakkok EP (location: South Singkawang District)  Bengkayang Regency  # Sungai Duri Congregation (location: Sungai Duri Village, Sungai Raya District) # Sungai Pangkalan Congregation (location: Sungai Pangkalan 2 Village, Sungai Raya District) # Pasar Gunung Congregation (location: Sungai Pangkalan 2 Village, Sungai Raya District) # Teluk Suak (Suak Bay) Congregation (location: Karimunting Village, Sungai Raya Islands District) # Sungai Raya Kepulauan (Great River Islands) EP (location: Sungai Raya Village, Sungai Raya Islands District)  Sambas Regency  # Pemangkat Congregation (location: Pemangkat District) # Tebas Congregation (location: Tebas District) # Selakau Congregation (location: Selakau District) # Matang Suri Congregation (location: South Jawai District) # Sentebang Congregation (location: Jawai District) # Sambas Congregation (location: Sambas District) # Kartiasa EP (location: Kartiasa Village, Sambas District)  Sekadau Regency  # Sekadau EP (location: Sekadau District)  Sintang Regency  # Sintang EP (location: Sintang District)  Melawi Regency  # Nanga Pinoh Congregation (location: Nanga Pinoh District)  Ketapang Regency  # Ketapang EP (location: Delta Pawan District)  Affiliated Schools  # Immanuel Christian School (Pontianak) # Maranatha Christian School (Siantan, North Pontianak) # Torsina Christian School (Singkawang) # Eben Haezer Christian School (Pemangkat) # Immanuel Christian School (Segedong, Mempawah Regency) # GKKB Christian School (Sungai Pinyuh, Mempawah Regency) # Immanuel Christian School (Nanga Pinoh, Melawi Regency) # Immanuel Christian Kindergarten (Sentebang, Sambas Regency) # Christian Educational Foundation School (Pontianak)  References   External links  * * Website of Pontianak Congregation Category:Churches in Borneo Category:Protestantism in Indonesia Category:Evangelical denominations in Asia ","title":"West Kalimantan Christian Church"},{"id":"39160206","text":"Ronan O'Mahony (born 28 May 1989) is an Irish former rugby union player, who played for Munster.

Early life Born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, he was recruited into the RAF in Jamaica in 1944 and in 1945 visited RAF Syerston but was based at Little Rissington, Bedford. From this visit he decided he wanted to live in Nottingham. He extended his service with the RAF for a further five years, married a local girl from Nottingham, Nellie Kelham, and settled on Pennyfoot Street. Eric and Nellie went on to raise 6 children together. Career His lifelong passion for racial equality inspired him to move into public life. Because of the prejudices shown towards black people in the 1950s, Irons set up the first community group, the Colonial Social and Sports Club, at his own house. Irons began work at Chilwell Ordnance Depot in the offices in 1952. Only a handful of black workers were employed at the depot. He began to take up the issue of discrimination with the Nottingham and District Trades Council. Through his efforts of negotiation, some of the problems were resolved and more black workers were taken on, both in the depot and in other employment. In 1955 Irons went on to the Consultative Committee for the welfare of black people, which was set up by a Council of Church/Social Services and the Colonial Social and Sports Club. The idea was to discuss prejudice and local issues. One of the problems lay in the fact that no black people were taking advantage of educational courses, particularly those held by the WEA. He challenged and helped to lift a city transport embargo on the employment of black workers and also helped the city council to tackle problems highlighted by the 1958 race riots. He made history in 1962 when he was appointed Britain's first black magistrate; he sat on the Nottingham bench for 29 years until his retirement in 1991. A champion for social justice, Eric Irons was awarded an OBE in the 1978 New Year Honours list. In 1999, the University of Nottingham awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree for improving race relations in the City.  Commemoration  The National Portrait Gallery, London, acquired a portrait of Eric Irons in 2017 as part of their Creative Connections: Nottingham project. The portrait was displayed as part of the exhibition by artist, Katherine Green, at Nottingham Contemporary in 2017, and then at the National Portrait Gallery until February 2017. In October 2019, a plaque was put up in Iron's memory by Nottingham Civic Society at the National Justice Museum in Nottingham.

Overview Broadly speaking, individuals shop around for their own private health insurance plan, known by the abbreviation 'OKP', with government registered and regulated companies. Various supplementary services with varying private contribution rates exist for those with special healthcare needs.Welcome to Liechtenstein - Information for Migrants The basic plans cover specialist treatments from neighboring nations such as Switzerland and Austria, though patients share some costs. Regular health check-ups with general practitioners are covered completely, with no out-of-pocket expenses. All permanent residents of Liechtenstein must contribute to the national healthcare fund, and employers must register their staff with the health insurance fund. Employees and employers pay into the healthcare fund. Dependent family members are covered by the contributions paid by employed family members. The unemployed, old age pensioners and people on long-term sickness benefit or maternity leave do not have to pay healthcare contributions. Self-employed persons must make their own contributions. The national healthcare fund covers most medical services including treatment by specialists, hospitalisation, prescriptions, pregnancy and childbirth and rehabilitation. There are around 64 general practitioners and consultants in Liechtenstein, though they are very competent and well-trained. General practitioners (GPs) prescribe drugs, treat acute and chronic illnesses, and provide preventive care and health education. Consultants are senior doctors who have completed a higher level of training, and tend to specialize in one field, such as gynecology, oncology, pediatrics, and dermatology. GPs must refer a patient to a consultant. Liechtenstein has one hospital, the National Hospital, situated in the capital, Vaduz, which is run in conjunction with private doctors specializing in internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and psychiatry. Emergency care at the hospital is free and available even to people who are not insured. There are numerous health centers throughout the country which only provide outpatient care, but offer a wide variety of specialist services, such as general practice, maternity care, pediatrics, and dental care, as well as laboratory, radiology, and other diagnostic services. They can also provide emergency medical aid. Outside Vaduz, every town has an emergency service operated by GPs and specialists, and doctors trained in emergency medicine travel with the ambulance service. Pharmacies are located throughout the country, and a pharmacist is on call at all times. For serious illnesses or complicated bone fractures, patients are transferred to specialized hospitals in Switzerland and Austria. There are private clinics staffed and managed by independent doctors and specialists operating in Liechtenstein. There are also about 26 dentists in the country, and all dental care is private and must be paid for. Abortion in Liechtenstein is illegal in almost all circumstances and is punishable by prison terms for the woman and the physician. An attempt to legalize it in 2011 was defeated by voters. In April and November 2012, the Landtag failed to advance proposals to relax abortion laws. Women in Liechtenstein who choose to have an abortions must cross the border to either Switzerland or Austria to have the procedure carried out legally.

The flyover in the west London suburb of Chiswick, was opened in 1959 with the intention of reducing congestion and the impact on local traffic of vehicles travelling around London on the North and South Circular Roads and between London and the west on the Great West Road. Although it was not originally built as a motorway, it was later incorporated into the M4 motorway. Description The original Chiswick flyover carries the first half a mile of the M4 from its start at junction number 1. The flyover was extended to be over two miles long in the early 1960s, forming part of the M4 junction 1 to junction 5 section that was opened in 1965. The first one-and-a-half miles of the flyover tracks the course of the A4 which is directly beneath it, effectively forming a two-tier road system. It then turns approximately west north-west across Boston Manor Park before the M4 returns to ground level, and widens from two to three lanes in each direction as it heads west through the grounds of Osterley Park. History Chiswick Flyover on Ordnance Survey Map, 1960, before incorporation into the M4 Flyover The flyover, built at a cost of ¬£6 million, was provided to relieve the congestion at Chiswick roundabout, the junction of Chiswick High Road, North Circular Road, South Circular Road and the Great West Road, caused by 40,000 cars per day using the junction. The opening ceremony for the flyover, which was performed by Hollywood actress Jayne Mansfield, took place on 30 September 1959. The second section opened on 25 November 1964. In October 2009, actress Imogen Stubbs unveiled a plaque in a ceremony in Chiswick to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the flyover. In 1964 the flyover became part of the M4 motorway and by 1969 was said to be the most dangerous road in Britain. By 2009, 97,000 vehicles per day were using the M4 over flyover.

The structure was half a mile long (0.8 kilometres) and wide with hard-shoulders of no more than wide. of concrete went into each of the columns supporting the road. Folklore Rumours arose that the bodies of the victims of the Kray twins, notorious London gangsters, were entombed in the concrete pillars of the flyover.

Avis Rent a Car South Africa is part of the Avis Rent a Car System and the company operates as a subsidiary of Barloworld Limited since it was acquired in March 2005 and was delisted from Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The name Avis, however, remained unaltered. History Avis was the brainchild of Warren Avis, who realised there was a need for people to be transported from airports to other destinations. With this insight in mind, Avis was born in December 1946 in Detroit at Willow Run Airport. Despite keen opposition, Avis managed to grow at the fastest rate of any major company during the 1960s. In 1967, Zeda Car Rental and Tours (Pty) Ltd was established in Bloemfontein. Shortly thereafter, Federale Volksbeleggings Bpk, a subsidiary of Sanlam, acquired a majority shareholding in the company. Later Federale went into a joint venture with Avis Rent a Car System, thereby adopting the name Avis Following the adoption of the Avis name, the business grew steadily and by 1972, the car rental business had expanded to include Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. By 1972 the company was represented countrywide and in 1980 it diversified into full maintenance leasing. To accommodate this diversification, Zeda Car Rental & Tours (Pty) Ltd changed its name to Zeda Car Leasing (Pty) Ltd. By the mid-1980s, the company had grown into the largest licensee outside the United States and was registered as Zeda Holdings (Pty) Ltd. The business began to expand beyond South Africa into Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland and administered sub-licensees in Angola, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 1991, Zeda Holdings entered into an agreement with the AVIS international company, which allowed them access to the Wizard real time, on- line computer system that services Avis operations around the world. The Federale name changed several times and in 1992 the name Fedservices changed to Servgro International Limited. Servgro listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in August 1992, with Servgro holding 85 percent of the shares and Avis senior management holding 15 percent of the shares. In 1993, Avis was awarded the South African Bureau of Standards ISO 9002 quality management system. In April 1997, Servgro unbundled and Avis Southern Africa was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Namibia Stock Exchange and Botswana Stock Exchange stock exchanges. In 1998, Avis Luxury cars were introduced, offering customers luxurious self-drive spoils and in 2001 Avis Chauffeur Drive was introduced. In 2002, Grenville Wilson introduced the Avis Brand Ambassador way of life to Avis, a programme aimed at engendering a culture of ‚Äúchoose to‚Äù people within Avis. In the same year Avis introduced its Point-to-point service. In March 2005, Barloworld Limited acquired the full ownership of Avis Southern Africa, hence the delisting from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

It premiered on September 26, 2013, as part of the 2013 fall season. After a winter break, it returned on February 25, 2014, moving to Tuesday nights to finish its season. The second part of the season featured the 100th episode of the series, the 12th episode of the season, which aired on March 18, 2014. It was shorter than previous seasons, with twenty episodes instead of twenty-two. The series features the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School (WMHS) in the town of Lima, Ohio, and graduates of McKinley who have moved to New York City, some to attend the fictional New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA). Unlike previous seasons, the fifth continues the school year begun in season four. The first half of the season follows the club competing on the show choir circuit, while the remainder of the season focuses on graduation and the alumni's lives in New York City as its members, faculty and alumni deal with gay bashing, death, intimacy, STDs, transphobia and other social issues. The central characters are glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach and school principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), glee club members Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and graduates Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Previously recurring characters Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell), and Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), who are current glee club members at WMHS, have been promoted to the main cast in the fifth season--though none of them appear in the last trimester, seven episodes, of the season, as the season moves its focus to the alumni. Heather Morris, Amber Riley, Mark Salling, and Harry Shum, Jr., who have portrayed Brittany Pierce, Mercedes Jones, Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman and Mike Chang (respectively) since season one, are no longer series regulars, but did appear as guest stars. This is the first season not to feature Cory Monteith, who died shortly before production was scheduled to begin. The death of Monteith's character, Finn Hudson, was the subject of the third episode, \\"The Quarterback\\", which paid tribute to them both. The series went on hiatus after the third episode, and resumed airing episodes after the baseball postseason. The season was nominated for one Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Episodes Production The season's production was set to begin in mid-July, with shooting commencing July 29, 2013. On July 18, 2013, it was announced the show would be going on a two-week hiatus while its writers and producers rewrote the storylines and figured out how to handle the death of Monteith's character, Finn Hudson. On July 19, 2013, Glee announced through their official Facebook fan page that the season premiere would air on September 26, one week after the original date, and filming would begin in early August. The season ultimately began shooting on August 5, 2013, a week later than originally planned, though studio recording and costume fittings for the cast began four days earlier. On July 20, 2013, Ryan Murphy stated in an interview that Monteith's character would die in the third episode of the season and that episodes one and two will be tribute episodes to the Beatles. Lea Michele, Monteith's girlfriend who also stars as Rachel Berry on the show, was involved in the decision. After the third episode was completed, there was another hiatus while the creative team reworked the rest of the season. The show returned after the baseball postseason was over, and aired five episodes in a row without interruption. For the 100th episode of Glee, which is the twelfth episode of this season, a promotion called \\"Gleeks Choice\\" was run by Fox at the end of November 2013 to allow fans to choose ten songs from a list of thirty that were performed in the past episodes of the series. The ten songs that received the most votes were to be featured in the episode. The list of thirteen songs that was eventually released in late February 2014 for the two-part 100th episode contained eight songs from the original thirty-song list, not ten. On March 17, 2014, it was revealed that Chris Colfer will write an episode later in the season. It was later revealed that he will be writing the nineteenth episode of the season. Cast Fox credits fourteen main cast members for the season: Matthew Morrison as glee club director Will Schuester; Jane Lynch as cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester; Chris Colfer, Lea Michele and Naya Rivera as McKinley graduates and former glee club members Kurt Hummel, Rachel Berry and Santana Lopez, respectively; and Jacob Artist, Melissa Benoist, Darren Criss, Blake Jenner, Kevin McHale, Alex Newell, Chord Overstreet, Becca Tobin and Jenna Ushkowitz as current glee club members Jake Puckerman, Marley Rose, Blaine Anderson, Ryder Lynn, Artie Abrams, Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams, Sam Evans, Kitty Wilde and Tina Cohen-Chang, respectively. Five actors received contractual upgrades, having formerly been recurring cast members: Artist, Benoist, Jenner, Newell and Tobin. Five actors depart the main cast: Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson), who died on July 13, 2013; and Heather Morris (Brittany Pierce), Amber Riley (Mercedes Jones), Mark Salling (Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman) and Harry Shum, Jr. (Mike Chang). Riley, Salling and Shum have been listed among the guest cast for this season. Murphy tweeted on December 3, 2013, that he had asked all original cast members to return for the 100th episode ‚Äî Riley, Salling and Shum returned, and Morris made her season five debut in this episode alongside Dianna Agron, who portrays Quinn Fabray. Kristin Chenoweth and Gwyneth Paltrow, April Rhodes and Holly Holliday on Glee, respectively, also returned for the 100th episode. Two former main cast members, who appeared as recurring guest stars in the fourth season, have been cast in series regular roles in new television shows: Mike O'Malley on Welcome to the Family, and Jayma Mays on The Millers. O'Malley has confirmed that he will also be appearing on Glee in its fifth season, and Mays \\"has been cleared to appear in a few episodes\\" of the show. NeNe Leakes has also returned as a recurring guest, and Dot-Marie Jones has already filmed scenes for the season's third episode. Trisha Rae Stahl, who plays McKinley lunch lady (and Marley's mother) Millie Rose, has returned as well. Chace Crawford appeared on Glee's 100th episode as a Yale student named Biff who was also Quinn's new boyfriend. Ryan Murphy has announced that Adam Lambert is set to join the cast during the fifth season; Chris Colfer later revealed that Lambert is to play the \\"nemesis\\" to Colfer's character, Kurt Hummel, who is a student at the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA). It was initially reported that Demi Lovato was in negotiations to join the cast for a six- episode arc starting with the season's second episode as Dani, a friend of Santana (Naya Rivera) and Rachel (Michele) in New York, who also would interact and sing with Lambert's character; the show subsequently confirmed that Lovato would be joining the show. However, Lovato only appeared four episodes during the season, due to her commitments of The Neon Lights Tour. Lea Michele posted on Twitter on August 22, 2013, that her friend Phoebe Strole would be appearing on Glee during the season; her character, Penny Owen, was a sophomore in college and a new love interest for Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet). Erinn Westbrook has been cast as a new recurring McKinley cheerleader, Bree, who is said to be a \\"mean girl\\". To date, reports have appeared concerning seven new recurring characters being cast for Glee fifth season: three females and four males. The females include Ruby, a new African- American student at McKinley High, and two women in their twenties, Ryan, who sings and plays the guitar, and a \\"cute and quirky\\" character variously named Julie and Jenny, who will first appear in the second episode. So far, three characters have appeared that fit these descriptions, albeit with different names: an African-American student at McKinley High named Bree (played by Westbrook), a guitar-playing woman named Dani (Lovato), and the new McKinley nurse, a college sophomore named Penny Owens (Strole). The four males include three men in their forties or fifties: the talented and egotistical Roderick Easton; an intelligent and good-looking teacher named Jim Elliott; and Jurgen, who speaks with an Austrian or German accent. The fourth, Henry, has just been reported by name. A character who fits the description of a man with a German or Austrian accent in his forties or fifties is Gunther (Christopher Curry), who runs the Spotlight Diner. Reception Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the season a 71% with an average rating of 7.5/10, based on 14 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Glee finds beauty in tragedy during a season that cathartically addresses the untimely passing of star Cory Monteith, while finding some new grace notes among its expansive ensemble, but the series is still indulging in the soporific tropes and cheesy self-seriousness that some viewers have come to dread.\\" Ratings Measurements of live plus same day (DVR) viewers fell considerably, relative to previous seasons. While season 4 saw the first viewership numbers below 6 million for an episodes, season 5 saw the first viewership numbers to fall below 2 million an episode. =Live + SD Ratings= Home video releases Glee: The Complete Fifth Season was released on January 6, 2015 in DVD, with 6-set discs.

The Kansas City Royals selected him in the 13th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, but he did not sign. Sunny Golloway, the head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners baseball team, representing the University of Oklahoma, encouraged Gray to enroll at Eastern Oklahoma State College, a junior college in Wilburton, Oklahoma, where he could continue to gain experience as a starting pitcher, as he would be used as a relief pitcher if he were to join the Sooners that season. For Eastern Oklahoma, Gray pitched to a 6‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.89 earned run average (ERA).

Its unique color range is the product of a complex geological history including marine sediments, lake and river movements elevated with the movement of the tectonic plates. Aside from the commonly known name this colourful hill carries, the locals of the town of Purmamarca also refer to it as the Hill of the Seven Skirts. This is an unofficial name, and not many people other than those who live here refer to it this way. The reasoning behind this second name is because of the resemblance between the colours on the hill and that of the traditional, long skirts worn by Andean women. This breathtaking sight is composed of 7 different colours, all of which derive from different types of rocks; leading to its diverse range of colours. Each colour/rock is also said to have formed during different time periods. Firstly, pink is believed to be composed of red clay, mudstone (mud) and arilitas (sand). Its estimated age goes back about 3 to 4 million years. The shade of white surrounding the pink is mostly made up of limestone and is aged about 400 million years. Continuing onto the mix of brown and purples, which are composed of lead, and rich in calcium carbonate, and is 80 to 90 million years of age. On top of the purple-brown colour, there is an earthy brown colour that has been detected in the rock. The rocks making up this colour are the most recent colours appearing on the rocks, aging at 1 to 2 million years old, and is described as ‚Äòfanglomerate composed of rock with manganese belonging to Quaternary.‚Äô As for the red, which is composed of claystones (iron) and other clays belonging to the upper Tertiary, its said to also be aged around 3 to 4 million years. The shades of green, aging at about 600 million years, are made up of phyllites, and slates of copper oxide. Finally, the yellow mustard colour is made of sandstones with sulfur, and is estimated at 80 to 90 million years. Legend has it: It is said that when the small town of Purmamarca, situated at the bottom of the hills, was formed, they had no colour to them, making them as dull as any other mountain, or hill. To the imaginative minds of the young children of Purmamarca, this was unacceptable. Whilst the adults of the town deemed it as normal, and something to be ignored, or ‚Äògotten used to‚Äô, the children refused to conform to this belief, and decided to do something unbelievable. Despite their warnings to the adults, none of them seemed to take the children seriously. This did not make a difference though, and they moved forward with their plan, regardless. For seven nights following their decision to decorate the hillside, the children disappeared from their beds, and every morning the adults would wake with a surprise; a new colour was added to the hill. On the seventh night, all of the adults in the town woke early and found that all the children were missing from their beds. Panicked, the adults began to search the town for their children. After having searched the entire town with nothing to show for it, all of the children began skipping down the hillside, laughing and playing. Since these seven nights, the hill has been completely covered in the seven colours that the children painted onto it. Every year on this day since, the town of Purmamarca has a celebration in honour of the painting of the colourful hillside. Tourism/Access to the hill: The hill is said to be the most beautiful during the first 45 minutes after dawn, and is no stranger to tourists who choose to take advantage of the breathtaking sight. Tours are also offered of the town of Purmamarca, situated at the base of the colourful hills, which include them as one of the biggest attractions. There are also specific tours of the hills themselves via horseback rides, hikes/walks, bike tours and photographic safaris. If you are looking to hike to the mountain, there are two trails that lead to promising lookout points, one that is a ten- minute walk, and the other being an hour walk. Information on how to get to these locations, etc., is not difficult to find within the town through the tourism office. The town of Purmamarca: Purmamarca is considered one of the most ‚Äòpicturesque villages in the Humahuaca Ravine.‚Äô This town is a quaint little town nudged at the bottom of the famous hills. Largely focused on the tourists that come to see the mountain; the town has a lot of artisan stands selling all kinds of tapestries, hand-knitted clothing, artwork, sculptures, pottery, etc. There are many celebrations honoured through the town, proving the thick culture within its people. Some of which include the \\"‚Äòmisa-chico‚Äô, the dead worship, the Pachamama worship or the autochthonous music played with quenas (Indian flute), cajas, erques and sikus.\\" Image:Cerro de los 7 colores.jpg Cerro de los siete colores, view from the road Image:Cerro de los Siete Colores 01.jpgCerro de los siete colores Image:Cerro_de_los_siete_colores.jpg Cerro de los siete colores, aerial view Image:Jujuy-Purmamarca-P3120100.JPG Side view  See also  * Purmamarca * Quebrada de Humahuaca * Pucar√° de Tilcara References External links *Article on the hill in the newspaper Sin Mordaza.

From 1998 until 2010, Hagy√≥ was active in the Hungarian Socialist Party. Immediately following the April 2010 elections, when Hagy√≥ lost his seat, he was arrested on suspicion of extortion and breach of fiduciary responsibility. The trial against Hagy√≥ and 14 other suspects is currently underway in Kecskem√©t.  Education  In 1989, Hagy√≥ earned a bachelor's degree in Product Engineering from the former Budapest University of Horticulture and Food Industry in Szeged, Hungary. After the undergraduate studies, he relocated to the university's Budapest campus in pursuit of an advanced degree in Food Engineering from the Department of Economics. Hagy√≥ claimed that he subsequently pursued doctoral work in the subject matter, but he was forced to abandon the academic project due to \\"political and personal life difficulties\\". Hagy√≥ did however co-author a published scientific investigation into the \\"conditions of the food retail trade units in Hungary\\".  Career   Private Sector  Resulting from the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the subsequent transition to a market economy, Hungary saw a significant increase in foreign investment and trade after 1991. Taking advantage of that, Hagy√≥ began working in 1992 for Wrigley's Hungarian operation, Hungaria. After working his way into an exclusive regional distribution position, Hagy√≥ became involved in many start- up food distribution companies. According to him, he enjoyed financial growth and professional success \\"thanks to the [post-Soviet] economic boom.\\"  Politics  In 1998, Hagy√≥ became a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party, citing Gyula Horn's \\"personality and role\\" as his attraction toward politics. Four years later, Hagy√≥ was one of 178 socialists elected to the National Assembly, thus granting him the title Member of Parliament. Thereafter he served as the party's president of district XII in Budapest, which placed him on the party's national board. At various moments between July 2002 until May 2006, Hagy√≥ was active in various parliamentary committees: Joint EU Institutions Committee, Regional Development Committee, Environmental Committee, and Foreign Affairs Committee. Also during that time, he delivered three speeches in Parliament, and he submitted a total of 55 independent and non autonomous motions. In 2005, acting as the party's chairman for nationwide charitable activities, he and Dr. Lajos Ol√°h organized Hope for Transylvania. With the help of the Hungarian Red Cross, they collected and delivered food, medicine, tents, blankets, and other emergency supplies to residents in the severely flooded region. Moreover, he helped secure substantial funds from the Hungarian Red Cross in an effort to transport many of the victims to Hungary while the damaged communities were restored. Due to the social unrest of a 2006 scandal involving former Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, many thought that opposing Fidesz representatives would oust the socialists from their seats in Budapest. Despite that, the Alliance of Free Democrats- Socialist coalition incumbent G√°bor Demszky was re-elected. In addition to holding his parliamentary position, Hagy√≥ was appointed as Deputy Mayor of Budapest on December 14, 2006. As Deputy Mayor, Hagy√≥ wield political oversight over the city's urban and asset management responsibilities. During his second parliamentary term, Hagy√≥ was active in the following committees between May 2006 and June 2007: Economic and Information Technology Commission, the Commission's Energy Subcommittee and the Enterprise Research and Development Subcommittee. Also during that allotted time, he made three speeches to Parliament, and he submitted a total of 15 independent and joint motions. As a member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, Hagy√≥ was elected President of the Hungarian Synchronized Swimming Association (MSZSZ) in 2007 after the resignation of the previous president, Csaba Haranghy. In a 2010 interview, MSZSZ Secretary General Laszl√≥ Szimandl stated in an interview: At that time, Hagy√≥ was forced to resign from the socialist party and its associated position. He therefore was unable to remain the president of the synchronized swimming association. According to promotional videos, his pride of his J√°szber√©ny heritage \\\\- an ethnically mixed community due to historical wars - and his recognition of Roma soldiers, Hagy√≥ is a supporter of ethnic diversity. During a March 2008 speech recognizing the efforts of Jews and Roma in the 1848 revolution, Hagy√≥ reminded his Hungarian audience that the history of the Serbs, the Croatians, and the Poles are regrettably more known than that of the Romany soldiers. Responding to the 2008 Tibetan unrest, Hagy√≥ signed a denunciatory petition to promote Hungarian political support for the Tibetans. While doing so, he urged all politician to come forth with support despite political affiliation. Moreover, Hagy√≥ stated:  Budapest Transit Authority (BKV)  In 2009, BKV was investigated by city's police and the State Audit Office of Hungary because of an employee severance payment controversy. Many of BKV's upper management were interrogated concerning possible involvement. Former BKV chief executive office Zsolt Balogh gave an interview to the daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet (Hungarian National) on March 6, 2010 and a separate interview the following day to H√≠rTV. During the interviews, Balogh publicly accused Hagy√≥ of extortion and breach of fiduciary duty. According to the accuser, he entered Hagy√≥'s office \\"in late September, early October 2007\\" as the freshly promoted chief technology officer. Then and there, Balogh claimed, Hagy√≥ dictated that Balogh must \\"be hard, because things must be done here, and who doesn't do it\\" will receive no mercy, and the throat \\"must be cut.\\" In the same two interviews, Balogh alleged that during a later meeting in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, Hagy√≥ demanded from Balogh an annual \\"membership fee\\" of 15 million forints which would need to be paid directly to Hagy√≥. Balogh admitted that the following day he obliged to the demand. In the March 6th interview, Balogh stated that he met Hagy√≥ in the office of Ott√≥ Lelovics, former public relations and communication consultant to BKV. Then and there he passed 15 million forints to Hagy√≥. Balogh stated that he knew \\"15 million fits in a Nokia box,\\" so he hid the money inside a Nokia box designed for mobile phone packaging. As a result, this scandal has become known as the \\"Nokia Box Case\\" or the \\"Magic Box Case.\\" On March 7, 2010 the online Hungarian news site Index.hu reported that Hagy√≥ resigned from his local and national positions in the Hungarian Socialist Party. In the same article, the party's spokesman, Istv√°n Nyak√≥, stated that the accusations had \\"not been about the truth.\\" Nyak√≥ also explained that other socialist politicians did not want the scandal to hinder the party in the upcoming 2010 elections. Immediately following the change of government on May 14, 2010, Hagy√≥ was detained by police. In addition to the bribery accusations from Balogh, police suspected him of instructing former BKV managing director Attila Antal of concluding an unnecessary contract with AAM and misappropriating funds related to the suburban railway line H√âV passenger information supply system.  Pretrial Detention  On May 26, 2010 Hagy√≥ was incarcerated at the Budapest Penitentiary in spite of numerous appeals from Hagy√≥'s lawyer, Andr√°s K√°d√°r. kadar argued that his client suffered from numerous illnesses and no evidence supported the stringent measure. The signatory judge, M√°ria Sz√≠v√≥s, cited the necessity of the coercive measure as prevention from suspect collusion and prevention of Hagyo fleeing the country. Prior to this, Hagy√≥, via his lawyer, Andr√°s K√°d√°r,expressed willingness to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. Hagy√≥'s initial release date was June 17, 2010. The prosecution repeatedly proposed sentence extensions, which were approved by the Pest Central District Court and confirmed by the Municipal Court. Hagy√≥ was released from prison into house arrest on February 13, 2011, and he remained on house arrest until June 8, 2011. On September 6, 2010, 11 days before his release,pretrial detention, was again to be extended via order 28.AJC.No.1850/2010/2., Hagy√≥ and K√°d√°r filed application no.52624/10 with the European Court of Human Rights. In the application, they complained against validity of the pretrial detention and numerous prison conditions under Article 5 ¬ß 1 (c), Article 5 ¬ß 4 in conjunction with Article 13, Article 3, and Article 8 in conjunction with Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. On April 23, 2013 the Court announced its decision, and in doing so they found that the Hungarian judicial system violating the articles associated with the complaint. While supporters of Hagy√≥'s detainment agreed that he needed to be detained before creating further damage, the judicial process through which the decisions were made to imprison Hagy√≥ received much criticism. A Hungarian law student used the detainment and the subsequent trial as case studies, focusing on the issue of basic rights established by the Convention. The main points of his contention were the prosecution's and court's unwillingness to allow neither Hagy√≥ nor his lawyer access to the evidences. which, according to the former bodies, necessitated an extended pretrial detention, especially when Hagy√≥ suffered from deteriorating health. As Hagy√≥ was a young and popular socialist politician, some speculate that the detention and the trial have political, rather than criminal, motivations. This speculation stems from bloggers, academics, and journalists. Critics of Hagy√≥ consider him a relic of Soviet-imposed communism, a symbol of corruption.  Forgery Accusations  While serving his pretrial detention at the Budapest Penitentiary, Mikl√≥s Hagy√≥, with legal oversight from Dr. Viktor G√©za Sz≈±cs, empowered his common-law wife to act on his behalf with regards to Hagy√≥'s company, WIRTASS Trade and Service, LLC. on August 6, 2010. After receiving the authorization of the trial's prosecutor, the document was sent along with a letter from Hagy√≥'s common-law wife to Brigadier-General Csaba Boglyasovszky, the principal administrator of the Venyige Street Penal Enforcement Institution. In the letter, Hagy√≥'s partner states that the new situation would require extraordinary visiting rights. She was previously allowed to visit Hagy√≥ once a month. In her request (dated August 17, 2010), she states that \\"I would also like to record, that the actual mutual confidence alone is not sufficient to provide [for WIRTASS LLC.] adequate, objective and rational basis for decision making.\\" She therefore requested rights for two separate visitations per month to be \\"at pre-announced times in accordance with the house rules of the penal enforcement institution.\\" Principal Administrator Csaba Boglyasovszky positively replied to the request on August 19, 2010 and granted her a visitation on the 26th of August, 2010. In the letter, Boglyasovszky stated, \\"Referring to the letter dated on the 17th of August 2010. I inform you that for visiting Mikl√≥s Hagy√≥ detainee, to you as the legal representative is allowed.\\" Prior to that, the television show C√©lpont aired by H√≠rTV on March 21, 2010 allegedly showed material which were damaging to Mikl√≥s Hagy√≥ and his partner. As a result, Hagy√≥ filed a lawsuit against H√≠rTV within the Budapest Regional Court. On August 6, 2010 Hagy√≥ and Dr. Viktor Sz≈±cs signed a document which granted Hagy√≥'s common-law wife to act as his legal representative in the slander lawsuit. Hagy√≥ presented this authorization to the prison via his counselor on September 2, 2010. The prosecution observed this and the fact that Hagy√≥'s common-law wife lacked the necessary legal qualifications. They therefore filed misdemeanor foregery charges against Hagy√≥, his partner, and Dr. Sz≈±cs. All three persons were cleared of the charges by the Pest District Central Court on January 16, 2012.  The trial  In 2016, Hagyo was found guilty of abuse of office, as well as financial malfeasance by a first-level court in Hungary. Miklos was cleared of charges of corruption, which prosecutors have decided to appeal.https://budapestbeacon.com/miklos-hagyo-and-partners-given-suspended- sentences/ The appeals court in 2017 handed him a sentence of one and a half year, a decision which was not positively assessed by the ruling FIDESZ party.https://24.hu/belfold/2017/09/29/masfel-evet-kapott-hagyo-miklos/  Personal life  He is married to Be√°ta Csecserits.

History   2002‚Äì2004: formative years  In April 2002, four former Arthur Andersen consultants met at Miller‚Äôs Pub in Chicago and founded West Monroe. That group, which included Dean Fischer (chairman of the board emeritus) and Kevin McCarty (currently CEO and chairman of the board), established West Monroe Partners LLC, with the name deriving from Arthur Andersen's previous address on West Monroe Street in Chicago. Dean Fischer became the company's first president and CEO. The firm began serving its first client, Equity Marketing Services, in June 2002, and went on to deliver business and technology consulting services to a variety of mostly Midwestern clients from its Chicago office. In mid-2004, West Monroe hired its 50th employee and launched its first website.  2005‚Äì2009: expansion years  The years between 2005 and the end of the decade marked a period of expansion for West Monroe. In 2005, the firm opened three new offices in Montreal (January), Seattle (October), and Columbus, Ohio (December). During this year, the firm reached $10 million in revenue and hired its 100th employee, including members of West Monroe's first university recruiting class. In 2006, the National Association for Business Resources named West Monroe one of its ‚Äú101 Best and Brightest Companies to Work For‚Äù in Chicago. Since then, it has garnered similar accolades locally in Chicago, Seattle, and Columbus, as well as nationally from Consulting Magazine and Vault.

In 2007, West Monroe opened an office in New York City (April) and one in Dallas (September). West Monroe established in 2007 a formal, 13-member Board of Managers. During this period, the firm started practices to serve specific industries; for example, the Energy & Utilities practice, which has worked with utilities across the country to plan and advance smart-grid strategies. During the latter years of the decade, West Monroe also began to focus on multi-faceted business transformations. The same year, West Monroe also welcomed its first intern class.

However, while travelling in Italy, she met up with George Darwin, son of the naturalist Charles Darwin, who had commenced his travels independently although he was a member of her social circle, and they became engaged there. She married Darwin, in 1884 in Erie, Pennsylvania in an article lavishly described by The New York Times. The Jebbs were able to join them. In 1885 they bought Newnham Grange in Cambridge. They had five children: * Gwen Raverat (1885‚Äì1957), the artist. * Charles Galton Darwin (1887‚Äì1962), the physicist. * Margaret Elizabeth Darwin (1890‚Äì1974), who like her mother was the wife of a Cambridge don, Sir Geoffrey Keynes. * William Robert Darwin (1894‚Äì1970), known as \\"Billy\\", a London stockbroker * Leonard Darwin (b./d. 1899) She became Lady Darwin on her husband's knighthood in 1905; she was widowed in 1912.

Southern Tide manufactures and markets classically styled clothing, footwear, and accessories for men, women and children. The brand is owned by Atlanta-based Oxford Industries. One of the company's signature lines is their Skipjack Polo Shirt.  History  According to Stephenson, the inspiration for Southern Tide came about during college, while studying abroad in Italy. The clean lines and craftsmanship of Italian architecture, automobiles, and fashion stuck with Stephenson upon his return to the U.S. During his senior year at The University of South Carolina, he presented his concept for Southern Tide for a speech class, complete with sketches, his plan to work with stores, and his vision for a high-quality classic clothing company. Following his presentation, Stephenson remembers his professor encouraging him to pursue his idea, asking, \\"What are you doing sitting in my business introductory speech class?\\". That night, he packed up his dorm room and drove home to Greenville, South Carolina. After dropping out of college, he spent months researching the construction of polo shirts from around the world. The finished product became the Southern Tide Skipjack Polo, identified by the company's embroidered Skipjack emblem on the chest.

The company's focus is on developing vaccines for infectious diseases and drugs to treat for cancer and rare diseases. Founded in 2000 by Ingmar Hoerr (CEO), Steve Pascolo (CSO), Florian von der Mulbe (COO), Gunther Jung and Hans-Georg Rammensee, CureVac had approximately 240 employees in November 2015 and 375 in May 2018. CureVac has entered into various collaborations with organizations, including agreements with Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi Pasteur, Johnson & Johnson, Genmab, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.  History  Research collaborations In October 2013 CureVac launched a collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, for the development of novel flu vaccines. Also in 2013, CureVac announced the fourth in a series of partnerships with the Cancer Research Institute and Ludwig Cancer Research to enable clinical testing of novel cancer immunotherapy treatment options. In March 2014, CureVac won a ‚Ç¨2 million prize awarded by the European Commission to stimulate new vaccine technologies. Later, in July 2014, CureVac signed an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi Pasteur to develop and commercialize an mRNA-based prophylactic vaccine. By September 2014, the company licensed the global rights for its Phase I candidate ‚Äì CV9202 ‚Äì to Boehringer Ingelheim. Boehringer was to conduct trials using the mRNA vaccine in combination with afatinib in advanced and/or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as inoperable stage III NSCLC. In March 2015, a CureVac investor, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, agreed to provide separate funding for several projects to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac's proprietary mRNA platform. By September 2015, CureVac entered into a collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) to accelerate the development of AIDS vaccines, utilizing immunogens developed by IAVI and partners, delivered via CureVac's mRNA technology. That same month, CureVac announced it would open a United States hub in Boston, Massachusetts. In accordance with its deal with Lilly, the company began construction on a production facility in 2016. Investment By 2017, CureVac had received approximately US$359 million (‚Ç¨305 million) in equity investments and was valued at US$1.65 billion (‚Ç¨1.40 billion). In June 2020, the federal government announced that the state-owned development bank KfW would immediately invest 300 million euros in Curevac, which will mean that it will hold a 23 percent stake in CureVac.

The tenth main installment in the Mario Party series, it was released worldwide in March 2015. It is the first game in the series since Mario Party 4 to have Donkey Kong as a playable character for every aspect of the game. Mario Party 10 was the only game in the series to be released on the Wii U, and was followed by Super Mario Party for the Nintendo Switch in 2018. Gameplay Mario, Yoshi, Princess Peach, and Toad about to face Bowser Jr. in a minigame Mario Party 10 continues the tradition of the Mario Party series, in which four players, controlled by either human or CPU, compete against each other on a game board by participating in various minigames. Along with the standard competitive modes, the game introduces two new modes called Bowser Party and Amiibo Party. Mario Party mode The boards feature the same play style introduced in Mario Party 9, in which all four players travel across the board together in a car. If, collectively, all six possible numbers of the dice block are hit, Bowser appears and takes half of the Mini-Stars from the player who freed him. Bowser Party mode In Bowser Party, the fifth player controls Bowser using the Wii U GamePad. In this mode, the four main players are tasked with reaching the end of the board without losing all of their hearts whilst avoiding being caught by Bowser, who is trying to stop them. If Bowser catches up to the other players, a minigame takes place in which Bowser uses the GamePad's features to activate various devices, such as tilt controlled fire rods, pinball flippers, and breathing fire, whilst the other players attempt to take as little damage as possible. The players win if at least one player makes it to the end of the board with their hearts intact, but if all players are defeated, Bowser wins. Amiibo Party mode Amiibo Party involves up to four Amiibo characters playing on boards designed for those characters. Players who own an Amiibo are represented on the board by a three-dimensional figure, while players without one are represented by a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out. This mode is similar in gameplay to the original Mario Party series through Mario Party DS. The compatible characters include Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Rosalina. Reception Mario Party 10 received generally mixed reviews from critics, earning aggregate scores of 66/100 from Metacritic. Critics praised the graphics and minigames, but had complaints towards the linear boards and luck-based gameplay. Bowser Party was praised for being fun with friends and making good use of the GamePad, but Amiibo Party was criticized for having dull boards and the requirement for the player to touch their Amiibo to the GamePad every time they needed to make any sort of selection. Samuel Claiborn of IGN gave it a 6.5 out of 10, saying that it \\"carries over some bad ideas from Mario Party 9 that continue to deflate the fun.\\" Andre Segers of GameXplain gave the game a \\"Meh\\" rating, calling the Mario Party mode \\"completely random and arbitrary\\" and stating that Bowser Party grows repetitive quickly due to the small amount of minigames and it only being playable on three boards. He compared it unfavorably to previous games in the series. Mark Walton of GameSpot gave Mario Party 10 a score of 6 out of 10 with his main complaint being it is too familiar to past games. He felt the game lacks lasting appeal and wears thin quickly. \\"Despite the Amiibo additions and GamePad Bowser games, as well as a delightfully bright and colourful aesthetic, it's hard to ignore just how similar this game is to its predecessors. But even if you could overlook it, the fact remains that even with some fun minigames in tow and a good group of friends to enjoy it with, Mario Party 10 just doesn't have the depth or the challenge to hold your attention for long.\\" Sales In the United Kingdom, the Mario Party 10 had the second best launch in the series, behind Mario Party 8. In the United States, roughly 290,000 physical and downloaded copies of the game had been sold by the end of March 2015. This was faster than Mario Party 9, which only sold 230,000 in around three weeks. In Japan, Mario Party 10 underperformed compared to the previous game, selling about 50,000 copies in its first week. As of late June 2015, over 159,000 copies had been sold in Japan. As of March 31, 2020, the game has worldwide sales of 2.23 million copies and is the tenth best selling game on the Wii U.

While other churches have relatively rigid interpretations for the requirements of this transmission, the Anglican Communion accepts a number of beliefs for what constitutes the episcopate. In the sixteenth century, a solid body of Anglican opinion emerged which saw the theological importance of the historic episcopate but refused to 'unchurch' those churches which did not retain it. This was questioned during the earlier part of the seventeenth century and the 1662 Act of Uniformity excluded from pastoral office in England any who lacked episcopal ordination. This was a reaction against the abolition of episcopacy during the Commonwealth period. The refusal of the Non-Jurors to swear allegiance to William III raised the question as to the nature of the Church and its relationship with the state and some theologians such as George Hickes and William Law appealed to an apostolic episcopate as its basis. This concept became part of the thought of the High Church but only came into real prominence with Newman and the Tractarians after 1833 when the possibility of Church reform and possibly disestablishment by parliamentary action became a reality. The tensions were increased by the \\"romanizing tendencies\\" of the Tractarians and later the Ritualists and Anglo-Catholics. The historic episcopate has been among the major issues in schemes for church reunion such as the Church of South India and the Anglican-Methodist Conversations of the 1960s which failed and were renewed informally in 1995 and led to a Covenant in 2003 .  Concept  Outside Anglicanism, the standard understanding of the term historic episcopateThe phrase \\"historic episcopate\\" is far more common in Anglican writings than \\"historical episcopate\\". is that the Christian ministry has descended from the Apostles by a continuous transmission, and that this is the guarantee of grace in the sacraments and the very essence (esse) of the Church. Anglican Communion \\"has never officially endorsed any one particular theory of the origin of the historic episcopate, its exact relation to the apostolate, and the sense in which it should be thought of as God given, and in fact tolerates a wide variety of views on these points\\":, quoting the Anglican-Methodist Unity Commission Report 1968 p.37 The historic episcopate has been among the major issues in schemes for church reunion such as the Church of South India and the Anglican-Methodist Conversations of the 1960s which failed and were renewed informally in 1995 and led to a Covenant in 2003 .  History   From the Reformation (1533) to the Restoration (1662)  According to The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology, The Anglican Communion \\"retained episcopacy, believing it to be not merely an administrative expedient of contingent historical origin but an essential part of the church as founded by Christ.\\" Its claim to apostolic succession is rooted in the Church of England's evolution as part of the Western Church. When Henry VIII broke away from the jurisdiction of Rome in 1533/4, the English Church retained the episcopal polity and apostolic succession inherent in its Catholic past; however, Protestant theology gained a certain foothold and under his successor, Edward VI what had been an administrative schism became a Protestant reformation under the guiding hand of Thomas Cranmer. Although care was taken to maintain the unbroken sequence of episcopal consecrations, particularly in the case of Matthew Parker after Elizabeth I's coming to the throne, apostolic succession was not seen as a major concern: English Reformers such as Richard Hooker rejected the Catholic position that Apostolic Succession is divinely commanded or necessary for true Christian ministry.\\"While he argues that the rank originated with the Apostles, enjoyed divine approval, and flourished throughout Christendom, he rejects the view inherent in the Catholic position that the office is divinely commanded or is a result of divine law.\\" The preface to the Ordinal limits itself to stating historical reasons why episcopal orders are to 'be continued and reverently used in the Church of England'. The \\"foreign Reformed [Presbyterian] Churches\\" were genuine ones despite the lack of apostolic succession because they had been abandoned by their bishops at the Reformation. This view was of the reformed churches was questioned during the earlier part of the seventeenth century and the 1662 Act of Uniformity formally excluded from pastoral office in England any who lacked episcopal ordination but this was a reaction against the abolition of episcopacy in the Commonwealth period.  From the Glorious Revolution (1688) to the Great Reform Bill (1832)  After 1685 the practices of both James II and William III of England made it plain that the Church of England could no longer count on the 'godly prince' to maintain its identity and traditions, the 'High Church' clergy of the time began to look to the idea of apostolic succession as a basis for the church's life. For William Beveridge (Bp of St Asaph 1704-8) the importance of this lay in the fact that Christ himself is \\"continually present at such imposition of hands; thereby transferring the same Spirit, which He had first breathed into His Apostles, upon others successively after them\\", but the doctrine did not really come to the fore until the time of the Tractarians.  From the Oxford Movement (1833) to the South India Debate (1955)  Newman laid great stress on apostolic succession: \\"We must necessarily consider none to be' 'really' 'ordained who has not been thus ordained\\". After quoting this, Ramsey continues: \\"With romantic enthusiasm, the Tractarians propagated this doctrine. In doing so they involved themselves in some misunderstandings of history and in some confusion of theology\\". He goes on to explain that they ascribed to early Anglican authors a far more exclusive version of the doctrine than was the case, they blurred the distinction between succession in office (Irenaeus) and succession in consecration (Augustine); they spoke of apostolic succession as the channel of grace in a way that failed to do justice to His gracious activity within all the dispensations of the New Covenant. Newman, and after him, Charles Gore held that the episcopate was passed down from the apostles through men like Timothy and Titus to single bishops in particular localities (monarchial episcopacy). However, Bp. Lightfoot argued that monarchial episcopacy evolved upwards from a college of presbyters by the elevation of one of their number to be the episcopal president and A. C. Headlam laid great stress on Irenaeus' understanding of succession, which had been lost from sight behind the Augustinian 'pipe-line theory'. The implications of the apostolic succession for the nature of the episcopate and the Church were spelt out by later Anglo-catholic writers: \\"There is, and can be no real and true Church apart from the one society which the apostles founded and which has been propagated only in the line of the episcopal succession\\" and \\"[a] Church stands or falls by the Apostolic Succession ... There has never been a Church without a bishop, and there never can be\\".Quoted by , from (i) Goulbourn, E.M. The Holy Catholic Church 1873, p.83, and (ii) Staley, V. The Catholic Religion, 1894, pp 23, 31  Recent developments  The Anglican‚ÄîRoman Catholic International Commission report expressed broad agreement in the nature of apostolic succession as the ‚Äòeffective sign‚Äô of the apostolicity of the whole people of God, living in fidelity to the teaching and mission of the apostles. The modern debate divides three ways: between those who see the 'Historic Episcopate' to be constitutive of the Church (of the 'esse'); those who hold it is a question of its \\"well-being\\" (bene esse); and those who consider that it is necessary for the Church to be fully itself (plene esse). The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral includes the \\"historic episcopate\\" as \\"essential to the visible unity of the church\\", but allows for its being adapted locally in its working to the varying needs of those who God calls into the unity of the Church. However, this has not meant a general commitment to the idea that in its absence there is no Church.

He received numerous awards for his scientific research and public service, including the LG Groves Memorial Prize (which he won twice) and the Imperial Service Medal. Early life Findlater was born in Motherwell, Scotland, in May 1926, the son of a railway superintendent. He moved to Inverness at a young age, and was educated at Inverness Royal Academy, where he developed a fascination with aircraft. Second World War During the Second World War, Findlater served in the RAF, working aboard weather-monitoring ships in the Atlantic Ocean. Later in the war, he survived a violent plane crash in a Bristol Blenheim light bomber at an Inverness airfield, being the only crewperson to escape without serious injury. While in the RAF, Findlater became highly knowledgeable about aircraft and aeronautical engineering, and worked as a consultant and researcher with the RAF numerous times in his later career. Met Office work and retirement After the war, Findlater joined the Met Office, beginning his career as a teacher of meteorology in Nairobi, Kenya. While in Kenya, he began studying the monsoon winds that develop around the Horn of Africa, conducting hundreds of research flights over the Indian Ocean to gather data. During this period, he discovered a previously unknown wind system that blows diagonally across the Indian Ocean parallel to the Somalian coast; the phenomenon was named the Findlater jet in his honour. Findlater furthermore received the LG Groves Memorial Prize for his research. He then returned to the United Kingdom, where he served as a Principal Scientific Officer and air crash investigator for the Met Office. In 1987, two years before his retirement from the Met Office, Findlater investigated the haar, or coastal fog, that affected operations at RAF bases in Scotland. He received a second LG Groves Memorial Prize for this work. Findlater retired from the Met Office in 1989, receiving the Imperial Service Medal for his distinguished service. He continued to offer expert advice on aviation policy in his later years, advocating for the conservation of aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol jet. He died in March 2013 at the age of 86. Personal life Findlater was survived by his wife, Mary, and daughter, Fiona. He was a proficient glider pilot, at one point working as a glider flight instructor at Lasham Airfield in Hampshire.

Based on author Debbie Macomber's book series of the same name, Cedar Cove focused on Municipal Court Judge Olivia Lockhart's professional and personal life and the townsfolk surrounding her. It was the network's first original scripted series. On December 1, 2015, the series was announced as canceled and would not be renewed for a fourth season.  Plot  Cedar Cove is a quaint, picturesque town on an island in the Puget Sound. Neighbors for the most part try to help each other, and people do not lock their doors in their trust in the community. The moral center and compass of the town is Olivia Lockhart, the bicycle-riding, scarf-wearing municipal court judge who grew up in the town. Regardless of her being the focus for many in town, Olivia's life has not been issue-free, she long ago had gone through a divorce from her physician husband; the dissolution of their marriage largely was due to the accidental drowning death of their son, Jordan, when he was 13, an incident from which they as a couple could not recover. Also affected was Jordan's twin sister, Justine, now a young woman, who has been struggling to find her place in life ever since. Much like the town is being pulled in different directions, such as by cutthroat developer Warren Saget, Olivia is often pulled in different directions, personally and professionally, which one day may take her away from Cedar Cove. In the former category is her search for love. Through it all, she acts as supporter to her friends and family, including librarian Grace Sherman, her best friend since they were children. Cast and characters Main cast * Andie MacDowell as Olivia Lockhart, Cedar Cove Municipal Court judge * Dylan Neal as Jack Griffith, editor of the local newspaper, the Cedar Cove Chronicle, an admitted recovering alcoholic, and Olivia's love interest * Teryl Rothery as Grace Sherman, Olivia's librarian best friend * Sarah Smyth as Justine Lockhart, Olivia's artistic daughter who is an insecure person, largely because of the death of her twin brother Jordan when they were 13, and the resulting dissolution of her parents' marriage * Brennan Elliott as Warren Saget, a cutthroat Cedar Cove land developer * Bruce Boxleitner and Barbara Niven as Bob and Peggy Beldon, a married couple and owners of the local bed and breakfast, 'Thyme and Tide', * Timothy Webber as Moon, the aged hippie proprietor of Moon's, a caf√©/knick- knack store * Corey Sevier as Seth Gunderson, Justine's high-school boyfriend, who now a commercial fisherman, returns to town in hopes of renewing their relationship, portrayed by Greyston Holt in the pilot episode (seasons one and two) * Paula Shaw as Charlotte Jeffers, Olivia's headstrong mother (season one) * Delilah (voiceover only), a nationally syndicated radio host, she provides quotes and inspirational passages as the host of her radio show in- universe in a fictional sense.

(season two, recurring seasons one and three) * Jesse Hutch as Luke Bailey, an ex-Navy SEAL suffering from PTSD (seasons two and three) * Emily Tennant as Cecilia Rendall, a high school friend of Justine's (season two, recurring season three), portrayed by Katharine Isabelle in the series' pilot * Cameron Bancroft as Will Jeffers, Olivia's philandering brother (season three, recurring seasons one and two) * Cindy Busby as Rebecca Jennings, the young, ambitious assistant district attorney (season three, recurring season two) * Rebecca Marshall as Alex Baldwin, a ranch hand, ex-stockbroker, and recovering alcoholic (season three, recurring season two) * Colin Ferguson as Paul Watson, the new district attorney (season three) * Tom Butler as Buck Saget, Warren's wealthy businessman father (season three) Recurring cast * Charlie Carrick as John Bowman, an artist and chef, he served jail time for a crime committed by his brother, and ends up as Maryellen's love interest, portrayed by Giles Panton beginning in season three. * Hayley Sales as Shelly, Eric's folk- singing girlfriend * Mike Dopud as Roy Mcafee, a private investigator * Jesse Moss as Ian Rendall, Cecilia's military husband * Garry Chalk as Cedar Cove Sheriff Troy Davis (seasons one and two) * Matreya Fedor as Allison Weston, a high-school student who volunteers at the library (seasons one and two) * Andrew Airlie as Stan Lockhart, Olivia's ex-husband and Justine's father, he left the family following the death of their son Jordan.

Macomber stated that she tried to get the series filmed in Washington. \\"We did get tax incentives [for filmmakers] back but the problem is we don't have the infrastructure Canada does,\\" she said. With the announcement of the July 19, 2014, premiere date for the second season, Hallmark also announced that Sue Tenney, executive producer and writer for 7th Heaven, would take over as series showrunner. Book to television deviation In the book series, Grace's husband is disturbed by his actions in the Vietnam War and commits suicide, but for the television series, Macomber revealed that the network considered that \\"too heavy\\" of a storyline. Instead, Grace arrives home from vacation to announce her husband is divorcing her. Reception Cedar Cove was given \\"generally favorable\\" reviews at the Metacritic website, based on the aggregate score of 62 out of 100 from ten critics.

J. C. 1847. Prodrom einer Monographieder bohmischen Trilobiten. 176 pp. J. G. Calve, Prague, is a genus of trilobite belonging to Order Agnostida. It lived during the early Middle Cambrian (Amgan and Mayan stages) in what are now the Czech Republic and the North Siberian plateau. Like most agnostina the genus is isopygous, with cephalon and pygidium approximately equal in shape and size. Like other members of the family Peronopsidae it lacks a preglabellar furrow. Both cephalon and pygidium lack spines. It is difficult to distinguish Diplorrhina from many other peronopsids.  Taxonomy  Schematic showing the relationship between the genus Diplorrhina (light green) with other Peronopsid genera (darker green). The ancestor of Diplorrhina is most likely one of the Siberian species of the genus Archaeagnostus. D. recta is the most primitive species and it gave rise to D. cuneifera, which was in turn ancestral to Diplorrhina triplicata.

Description  Both border and border furrow of the cephalon are relatively narrow. The transglabellar furrow is straight or curved slightly towards posterior. The posterior glabellar lobe is parallel sided, has two pairs of lateral furrows and small basal lobes; there is no median node. The pygidial border is flattened and wide with posterolateral angles, but no spines. The pygidal lobes reach the median node but do not cross the axis. The distance between the pygidial axis and border furrow is short or sometimes touching.  Differences with Peronopis  Diplorrhina differs from members of the subgenus Peronopsis (Peronopsis) in the better developed transaxial furrows, better developed lateral furrows of the glabella, larger basal lobes, and in the trend towards the formation of a transverse depression of the axis.

He was a member of the Unit One group led by Paul Nash. Life Tristram Hillier was born on 11 April 1905 in Peking, China, the youngest of the four children of Edward Guy Hillier (1857‚Äì1924), a banker and diplomat, and Ada Everett. A Roman Catholic, he was educated at Downside School. In 1922 he returned to China to study the language, and then until 1924 attended Christ's College, Cambridge. He went to the Slade in 1926, where he studied under Henry Tonks, and then to Paris where he studied for two years under Andr√© Lhote, and also at the Atelier Colarossi. In Paris he met many members of the Surrealist movement; he was particularly influenced by Giorgio de Chirico and Max Ernst. He lived in France until 1940, but travelled extensively; he remained a surrealist painter throughout his life. His first one-man show was at the Lefevre Gallery in 1931; he later exhibited mainly at Tooth's Gallery. From 1933 he was a member of the Unit One group led by Paul Nash. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve with the Free French. After the war he lived in France and in Spain, and then went to live at Yew Tree House, East Pennard in Somerset, England. His autobiography Leda and the Goose was published in 1954. A retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the Worthing Gallery in 1960. He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1957, and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1967. Hiller married twice. From 1931 to 1935 he was married to Irene Rose Hodgkins, the daughter of a bookmaker, with whom he had twin sons, Jonathan and Benjamin. From 1937 he was married to Leda Millicent Hardcastle, daughter of Sydney Hardcastle, the inventor of the First World War Hardcastle torpedo; they had two daughters, Mary and Anna-Clare. Tristram Hillier died in Bristol, England, on 18 January 1983. He was buried at Glanvilles Wootton Church, five miles south of Sherborne, Dorset on 22 January 1983 (record number 732 in the Parish Registers of burials 1880-1985).

Later, in the early 1980s, Byron spent several years as a creative affairs executive for Ray Stark at Rastar Productions. In the 60s, Byron worked for a year as a reviewer (and sometime reporter) for Variety, and in 1971 he became the film- review columnist for The Village Voice at a time when the American film art and the dialogue surrounding it were being completely revisedhttp://bostonreview.net/jonathan-kirshner-pauline-kael-roger-ebert- film-criticism.

John Sheldon was elected General Secretary of the Civil Service Union in 1982, following service as Deputy General Secretary. During this time Sheldon and the CSU were amongst those active in opposing the Thatcher Government ban on trade union membership at GCHQ and the subsequent legal challenge in 1984. Sheldon described the government's ¬£1000 tax compensation for GCHQ workers as \\"Judas Money\\". In 1988 he then oversaw the subsequent merger with the Society of Civil and Public Servants to form the National Union of Civil and Public Servants and served as its General Secretary from 1993. When NUCPS merged with the IRSF in 1996 to form the Public Services, Tax and Commerce Union (PTC), Sheldon continued as Joint General Secretary along with the IRSF's Clive Brooke. During this period of service, Sheldon served for six years on the General Council of the TUC, standing down in 1998. In yet another merger, in 1998, PTC joined with the Civil and Public Services Association to form the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS). Sheldon continued as Joint General Secretary of PCS, alongside the CPSA's Barry Reamsbottom. Sheldon's right to continue to hold the position of General Secretary without election for more than five years was challenged under section 55 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 but the complaint was dismissed. Sheldon retired on his due date 31 July 2000, leaving Reamsbottom as sole General Secretary. That year Sheldon was awarded the OBE for his service to trades unionism. Following retirement, Sheldon remained active in trade union affairs, and chaired the Civil Service Appeals Panel. In 2005, Sheldon was invited to lead several independent internal trade unions investigations on behalf of PCS, the FBU and ASLEF. More recently, Sheldon attended a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the GCHQ campaign. Sheldon had two sons Jeff, who is known for his famous timing out incident in 2013 and Tom, who is a technically better player. The two sons started the premium bat company Reaper Cricket. Sheldon currently is involved in local cricket.

It is Lopez's first starring role in a scripted series since his ABC show George Lopez. As part of Debmar-Mercury and Lionsgate Television's syndication model, if the series hit certain ratings thresholds in its first 10-episode run, that would have triggered an additional 90-episode order. The program fell short of those thresholds and Saint George was canceled on June 25, 2014, after one season. Plot Saint George revolves around the hectic life of a recently divorced working class Mexican- American who has become a successful entrepreneur. Lopez portrays the main character who must balance his family life‚Äîconsisting of a demanding ex-wife, an 11-year-old son, and his mother, uncle, and cousin‚Äîand teaching history class at a night school once a week. Cast and characters Main cast * George Lopez as George Lopez * Jenn Lyon as Mackenzie Bradford-Lopez * Olga Merediz as Alma Lopez * Kaden Gibson as Harper Antonio Bradford-Lopez * David Zayas as Junior * Danny Trejo as Tio Danny Recurring cast * Diana-Maria Riva as Concepcion * Joey Pollari as Tanner Whitman * Tobit Raphael as Walden Penfield Episodes Reception Saint George has been panned by critics. Reviews on the site Rotten Tomatoes were very scathing, with the show holding a 0% rating and average score of 3.6/10. The consensus reads: \\"You'd need the patience of a saint to sit through an episode of Saint George, a tired sitcom with bad potty-humor jokes and thin characters.\\" Reception on Metacritic was somewhat better, but still negative, having a score of 31 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

The book was published on September 18, 2012 by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers and is set in New York City during the 1920s. The plot follows seventeen-year-old Evie O'Neill as she helps her uncle Will - curator of the fictional \\"Museum of American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult\\" - uncover the killer behind a mysterious series of murders. The book has been nominated for an Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy as well as a Bram Stoker Award, and was one of the YALSA's picks for \\"best audiobook of 2012\\". Plot Evie O'Neill, a young girl in the 1920s, is sent to live with her uncle after another in a series of disastrous events in her hometown. At the same time, a ouija board has awakened a spirit by the name of Naughty John. After hearing of numerous mysterious murders she uses her powers of object reading with the help of her uncle to defeat the spirit serial killer. Along the way, she discovers more people of her kind with supernatural abilities and they unearth mysteries that deepen their suspicions towards a bigger plan behind the murders. The sequel 'Lair of Dreams' picks up the pace, reveals more about characters central to the plot, and opens doors to new horrors. The third book 'Before the Devil Breaks You' follows the Diviners as they try to uncover who is bringing an army of killer ghosts from the beyond and who exactly is The King of Crows.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2207576/plotsummary  Characters   Evie O'Neill  Evie is a flapper, a 1920s party girl who often uses terms like \\"post-i-tute-ly\\" and wears her hair in a bob. A diviner, Evie has the ability to \\"read\\" objects, finding out secrets about their owners when she holds them in her hands. In Lair of Dreams, she becomes \\"America's Sweetheart Seer,\\" with her own radio show. Evie enjoys flirting, and at the end of The Diviners she enters her first real romantic relationship with Jericho in spite of her ongoing flirtation with Sam and her awareness of Mabel's crush on Jericho. She is 17 years old at the start of the series.  Mabel Rose  Mabel is Evie's best friend, one whom Evie gets into trouble every once in a while. The daughter of communist labor organizers, Mabel is relatively sheltered and plain compared to the more outgoing, flamboyant Evie. Mabel has harbored a crush on Jericho, who lives downstairs from her, for several years.  William Fitzgerald  William \\"Uncle Will\\" Fitzgerald is a professor of history and Evie's uncle. He becomes her guardian in The Diviners. Will runs the Museum of American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult (often referred to by New Yorkers as \\"the Museum of Creepy Crawlies\\") and employs Jericho as his assistant.  Sam Lloyd  Sam (whose birth name is Sergei Lubovitch) is a talented thief and con man. A diviner, Sam has the ability to avoid people's notice through willing them not to see him. He often flirts with Evie, and tries to maintain a detached, humorous view of his own life.  Jericho Jones  Jericho is Will's assistant at the museum, and Mabel's neighbor. He is notable for his great size and physical strength, as well as his characteristically dour outlook. After being injured by a bullet and resuscitated through a futuristic serum, Jericho reveals that most of his body runs on machinery because of a childhood bout of polio that left him unable to breathe without first an iron lung and later a \\"miracle cure\\" created by inventor Jacob Marlowe.  Memphis Campbell Memphis is a numbers runner working for a crime boss in Manhattan, one who is widely known throughout Harlem for collecting bets from residents throughout the neighborhood. A diviner, Memphis has the power to heal others, but has not used that power since his failed attempt to heal his mother resulted in her death. Memphis dreams of being a published poet, but cannot pursue that dream while he must take care of his little brother Isaiah. He has feelings for Theta Knight.  Theta Knight  Theta (former name: Betty Sue Bowers) is a Ziegfeld girl who also enjoys the free-wheeling lifestyle of a flapper. She lives in the same building as Mabel and Jericho, along with her roommate and best friend Henry. A diviner, Theta has the power to create heat and flames from her hands when distressed. Theta is on the run from her past in Kansas, where she escaped an abusive husband through use of her diviner power. She is in love with Memphis.  Henry DuBois IV  Henry is a former Louisiana resident who is best friends and roommates with Theta. He and Theta became best friends shortly after she arrived in New York, and he often plays the piano to accompany her dancing in the Ziegfeld Follies. A diviner, Henry can walk through other people's dreams and change those dreams. Henry is separated from his lover Louis, a violinist, and wants to save enough money to buy himself a new piano and also to bring Louis to join him.  Naughty John  \\"Naughty\\" John Hobbes is a dead serial killer, accidentally summoned by an ouija board, who kills to become the living avatar of a Christian cult known as The Brethren. He was hanged in the 1870s but his dark religious rituals afforded him a way to return after death as a ghost. When he was alive, he had romantic relations with Mary White Blodgett, whom he later killed as part of his series of 12 religious offerings.  Isaiah Campbell  Memphis's little brother. A diviner, Isaiah can predict the future, see through the backs of cards, and walk in dreams.  Blind Bill Johnson  Bill is a homeless gambling addict constantly in search of the next lucky number that will win him more money. A diviner, Bill has the power to steal life force from others and to kill them with his mind.  The Proctor sisters  Lillian and Adelaide Proctor are two old ladies who live on the top floor of the same building as Mabel. They perform small magics to protect their home and see the future, including through regularly sacrificing some of their many cats in order to read omens in the cats' entrails.  The homeless veteran  (Real name: Luther Clayton) The veteran is implied in this book to be a diviner, although Evie does not know how much to trust his warnings. He is a survivor of World War I, one who reminds Evie of her brother James who was killed in the war.  Arthur  Arthur is a Marxist revolutionary, implied to be a violent anarchist. He helps Mabel escape from a raid on a speakeasy, and has romantic interest in Mabel. Although Mabel is flattered by his attention, she also considers him dangerous because even her relatively radical parents consider him too extreme in his views.  The King of Crows  Described as a tall man in a stovepipe hat and a cloak of blue-black feathers, he is arranging some master plan and appears in dreams.  The crow  The crow follows Memphis around and occasionally scares him. It is believed to be Memphis's mother.  The girl with the green eyes (Ling)  Ling appears once in The Diviners, as simply \\"the girl with the green eyes\\" who walks through one of Evie's dreams, but she becomes the main character of Lair of Dreams. The daughter of Irish and Chinese immigrants, Ling can walk through others' dreams and talk to the dead inside those dreams. Development Book two of The Diviners (Lair of Dreams) was published in 2015. Book three (Before The Devil Breaks You) was released on October 3rd 2017. Book four (The King of Crows) is due for release on February 4th 2020. Bray has stated that she wrote the first novel because she was a \\"horror fan\\" and because she \\"wanted to write another series, something historical, but also supernatural\\". Reception Critical reception for The Diviners was positive, with the book garnering positive reviews from Entertainment Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. The Star wrote a mostly positive review, stating an overall positive opinion while expressing frustration that the ending didn't \\"feel more solid\\".

Altra has been ranked in the top 10 brands in ‚Äúrun specialty‚Äù and number 4 for trail running. In 2016, the company added apparel to its products line, starting to manufacture running and hiking apparel with a line of jackets, shorts, shirts, and socks. Altra developed a backless windbreaker that can be easily slipped on over a backpack or hydration pack during long distance running. Nevertheless, Altra currently focuses on footwear only.  History  Golden Harper cut up and altered different brands of running shoes to design a better performing shoe, which was later named \\"Zero Drop.\\" The name refers to the lack of height differential between the shoe's heel and toe area. Harper, along with early co-founder Brian Beckstead and business partners Quirl Hansen and Jeremy Howlett, demonstrated their new design to various footwear companies with little success, so they decided to start their own company. \\"Altra Footwear\\" was launched in 2009, partnering with Pulse Labs, an engineering firm at Brigham Young University, and with contract manufacturers in Asia. Harper chose the name \\"Altra\\" based on the Latin word \\"altera\\", which means \\"to fix or mend something that is broken.\\" The company was acquired in March 2011 by ICON Health & Fitness, a developer, marketer, and manufacturer of fitness- related products. In April 2017, the company announced a partnership with the Utah State University Outdoor Product Design and Development (OPDD) program. The purpose of the partnership will be to create a \\"Altra Running Lab\\" to provide expertise to participating as well as internship opportunities. The OPDD students will also be able to design and develop shoes, apparel, and other sports related products in a laboratory setting. In June 2018, VF Corporation completed the acquisition of Altra.  Design alt=Side view of an Altra trail running shoe. Golden Harper, founder of the company, noticed that the stride and gait of barefoot runners changed when the runners wore traditional running shoes. He suspected that the heel height of most running shoes was too high as compared to the height of the mid-foot or toe. At this time, Harper was working at his father's shoe store called \\"Runner's Corner\\", in Orem, Utah and he began modifying traditional running shoes by cutting them open, removing padding from the heel, and then using a toaster oven and glue to put the shoes back together. Harper recruited local runners and store employees to test out prototype shoes where the heel and forefoot were the same distance from the ground. The design proved to allow a more natural running experience where footfalls are in the mid to forefoot area instead of the more typical heel strike. Harper called this design \\"Zero Drop\\".  Growth  Word spread about these hacked shoes among the local running community, and Harper began selling them from his father's store. He commissioned a local cobbler to make 1,000 pairs, but soon sold out. After failing to interest established footwear companies, Harper took the idea for the shoe to venture capitalists and former Nike designers. The shoe quickly went from a back room operation to an established brand with international production. Altra first entered the North American market in 2011, and won the Runner's World Magazine's 2012 Editor's Choice Best Debut award. By September 2013, Altra Footwear was at 300 percent annual growth rate and opening in 25 to 30 new markets. Each year since 2011, Altra Running has doubled their sales revenue and over 1500 retailers are now selling their zero-drop, foot-shaped toe box shoes. Outdoor recreation gear and sporting goods Retailer REI started selling Altra Running shoes in the past year. Altra has also introduced a casual shoe line that are designed to be worn in the office or around town. The brand is looking to use social media, running event sponsorships, and TV advertising to reach new customers. Features Marathon Sports store on Boston Every Altra shoe features a Footshape‚Ñ¢ toebox that is not necessarily wide, but rather shaped like a healthy foot in a sock. All models of their shoes have ZeroDrop‚Ñ¢ which means that the heel and toe are designed to be at the same height. They offer both neutral and stability shoes for men and women with a variety of cushion levels. Charboneau, Michael. \\"The 13 Best Altra Running Shoes.

Wearables and smart shoes  During the 2015 Outdoor Retailer Summer Market, Altra introduced their first smart shoe, Altra IQ. Powered by iFit, the Altra IQ uses technology to help runners analyze their running biomechanics. Slated to be released in the spring of 2016, the Altra IQ is intended to collect data on stride, pace, foot strike zone (heel vs. midfoot vs. forefoot), ground contact time, left foot vs. right foot imbalances, and more, and to transmit the data via Bluetooth to a mobile device such as a smartphone or watch for analysis. In the spring of 2017, Altra introduced their first smart running shoe combining both tracking and coaching technology. The Torin IQ shoe tracks how fast and how far the wearer runs and is equipped with a voice coach that gives real-time advice, via a tether to a smartphone, on how to run better during a workout. The shoe is designed for both men and women and has an embedded sensor in the insole that measures a runners landing zone, cadence, ground contact time, and impact rate. The sensors in the shoe are powered by button cell batteries which can be replaced after an estimated 80 ‚Äì 100 hours of use. Sponsorships Altra has sponsored many prolific trail and ultra races within the United States, including the Western States Endurance Run, held each year in Squaw Valley, California and the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run. which starts and ends in Silverton, Colorado. In December 2016, Altra sponsored an event to break the world record for the fastest on a treadmill. Jacob Puzey beat the previous record by more than an hour, running the fifty mile distance in four hours, fifty-seven minutes, and forty-five seconds.

Background  Claud Adkins Hatcher was born on August 20, 1876 in Quitman County, Georgia to Lucius Adkins Hatcher and Eleanor Moore King. Hatcher had originally intended to become a doctor, but he changed his studies after his first year in college and soon thereafter became a graduate pharmacist from the University of Louisville School of Medicine. By 1901, Hatcher had established himself as a successful pharmacist, operating two pharmacies in Preston, Georgia and Dawson, Georgia. However, later that year, Hatcher left the pharmaceutical field to join his father, a wholesale grocer who had recently started a new wholesale grocery store in Columbus, Georgia. Founded as the Cole-Hatcher- Hampton Grocery Company, the company was soon renamed to the Hatcher Grocery Company after Claud and his father bought out the other investors in the company.  Creating RC Cola  Created in 1886, Coca-Cola had grown immensely in popularity in the decades that followed, and the product was sold in great quantities at the Hatchers' grocery store. However, following a disagreement with the Columbus representative of the Coca-Cola Company over wholesale pricing, Hatcher stopped carrying the product in his store and began developing his own soft drink in a laboratory in the basement of the grocery store. In 1905, Hatcher introduced a ginger ale called Royal Crown Ginger Ale as an alternative to Coca-Cola. Shortly thereafter, Hatcher created Chero- Cola, a cherry cola designed to compete directly with Coca-Cola. Following a reformulation in 1934, Chero-Cola was renamed Royal Crown Cola, later shortened to just RC Cola. Along with these two products, Hatcher developed a line of several other flavored sodas under the Royal Crown moniker. In 1905, Hatcher formed Union Bottling Works, a company to bottle these products. The company was renamed to the Chero-Cola Company in 1912. In 1924, the company introduce the Nehi line of fruit-flavored sodas, and the company was shortly thereafter renamed after this popular line.  Later life  Hatcher died on December 31, 1933 at the age of 57 and was buried in the Riverdale Cemetery in Muscogee County, Georgia. His will established the Pickett & Hatcher Educational Fund, a non-profit student lender.

Mika sy Davis toured France in late 2012. Following several months spent restylizing their image under the guidance of Malagasy superstar Silo, the duo gave an acoustic performance in Antananarivo on February 2013 that was recorded live to produce their fourth album.

N.p., n.d. Web. 2 May 2013. In a best value system, the value of procured goods or services can be simply described as a comparison of costs and benefits. A contractor or vendor is thus selected through a process of researching the vendors or contractors before a detailed project plan is made.\\"University of Alberta Transforms RFPs from Reactive to Proactive.\\" The Legal Edge, n.d. Web. 30 Apr. 2013. Although BVP is a new procurement method, it does build on procuring and tendering according to the MEAT principle (Most Economically Advantageous Tender). The principle enables the contracting authority to take account of criteria that reflect qualitative, technical and sustainable aspects of the tender submission as well as price when reaching an award decision. The BVP approach is based on the conviction that minimizing risks or eliminating risks when allocated information is effectively used for a proper choice. This means the more information that is available and the better it is utilized, the better the future can be predicted and the fewer decisions or risks have to be made. BVP is not merely a procurement method but an approach based upon natural law. Rather than changing and manipulating people, one can understand the nature of transactions which then can be anticipated on using expertise to a maximum, with minimum risks and maximum value as a result. Typically values are assigned to factors such as price, past performance, schedule, and vision. These values are tabulated for each potential vendor or contractor and one will come out on top.  Benefits of BVP  This system is claimed to be beneficial because it needs less decision making, prepares for the future, and minimizes risk. Even if risks occur, they can be effectively controlled or managed. One of the most important aspects of best value procurement is looking at past performance. It has a vision and method for procuring and tendering in which the main focus is not price, but the performance of market parties.\\"Journal for the Advancement of Performance Information & Value (JAPIV).\\" New CIB Encouraged Journal, n.d. Web. 30 Apr. 2013. If a client is looking to build a five million dollar building, it is important to see if potential vendors have completed projects on such a scale. This will prevent clients from selecting vendors based on a low bid. Best value procurement is allowed for US federal government projects under the Federal Acquisition Regulation and 10 USC ¬ß 2304.  Uses of BVP Around the World  The BVP system was developed in the United States. This system has been practiced in many projects in the US as well as in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, BVP is known as \\"prestatie inkoop,\\" which translates as \\"performance procurement.\\"  Phases of BVP  The Best Value Procurement process is made up of four phases: preparation, selection, clarification, and execution.  Choosing factors for BVP  The process of choosing the factors to guide procurement toward best value has three stages: identifying the possibilities, choosing relevant factors, and assigning values, or \\"weights\\". Identifying the possibilities is completed by the public procurement professionals in cross-functional teams, as well as company stakeholders with biggest agency. There is a risk of the potential lack of information, or expertise, on the side of the purchasing organization about the implementation of best value practices in specific cases. In such cases, public procurement professionals involved in the process reach out to other organizations, inquire about the best procurement practices, etc. Choosing relevant factors - during this stage, public procurement professionals assess multiple factors, such as the right quality, quantity, time, place, source, price, and risk. Other factors which can be taken into account are reliably, impact on the environment, and social benefit. It is the responsibility of the procurement professionals to choose the most relevant factors for consideration. Assigning values - based on the various conditions under which the procurement procedure is taking place, different factors are considered more or less valuable.  Alternatives to BVP  The most popular alternative to BVP is Lowest-Bid Procurement. Since the early 1800s, governments around the world have been using the simplistic lowest-bid process of public auctions. This was considered to be allowing them to derive the highest value from their purchases. In the modern times, however, the drawbacks of such process are recognized. Lowest-bid procurement does not consider the quality and the reliability of the services provided by the lowest bidder. This has the potential to result in bigger losses for the consumers of the purchase, and in some industries even lead to deaths of people due to the low quality of the good (e.g. public transportation).

The 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. History The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), established in 1861, is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1987, MIT had about 65 employees in its police department. In 2018 it employed 64 officers and 14 civilians. This is up from the 51 officers and 3 civilians it had in 2011. In 1987, MIT appointed Anne P. Glavin as its Chief of Police, making her the first woman in New England to be appointed chief of a professional, armed campus police department at a major university. In 1994, students famously \\"hacked\\" (or pranked) the MIT Police by placing a reconstruction of an MIT Police cruiser on top of the Great Dome. Shooting by Boston Marathon bombing suspects On April 18, 2013, around 10:25 pm, MIT patrol officer Sean Collier, age 27, of Somerville, Massachusetts, was shot in his patrol car while responding to a disturbance outside MIT's Stata Center. Collier was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The Institute advised MIT community members on or near campus to stay indoors. One suspect was later shot and killed; the other was captured the next day. Police investigation suggested that the suspects shot Collier in order to further arm themselves. Some law-enforcement officials said the suspects were seeking to provoke a large-scale confrontation with police. Collier had been a member of the Somerville Auxiliary Police Department from 2006 to 2009.Notice of death of Collier, masslive.com; accessed February 9, 2015. One week after the shooting, Collier's open-air memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people‚Äîincluding thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada‚Äîin a ceremony hosted by the MIT community. On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \\"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\\". The announcement added that \\"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\\". There was a spontaneous improvised temporary memorial to Collier on the MIT campus; the design for a permanent one at the same site was unveiled at an April 2014 ceremony commemorating the one-year anniversary of the bombings and his murder. At that occasion, Cambridge Mayor David Maher announced that the corner of Vassar Street and Main Street, near where his shooting took place, would be renamed \\"Officer Sean Collier Square\\". Representatives from his family and MIT ran in the 2014 Boston Marathon to raise money for a scholarship in his honor. His name has been inscribed in the Cambridge Police Department's memorial to its fallen officers. The permanent memorial is a granite structure resembling an open hand of peace inviting contemplation, designed by MIT Architecture Associate Professor J. Meejin Yoon. The memorial was completed and a dedication ceremony was held on April 29, 2015. Operations The MIT Police focus on a safe academic environment as well as emergency medical service 24 hours a day with or without MIT EMS.

Available from: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP85T00875R001100130082-2.pdf Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya‚Äôs first president in 1964 and Oginga Odinga his vice president. Despite Kenyatta enjoying widespread support across different ethnic groups, he and Odinga were perceived as the de facto leaders of their ethnic communities with Jomo Kenyatta representing the Kikuyu and Oginga Odinga representing the Luo. The global cold war was at its peak. The western and eastern blocs actively sought to influence local policy making and win allies resulting in a proxy cold war in Kenya. Local politics became enmeshed with cold war ideological divisions. Odinga and Bildad Kaggia criticised the Kenyatta government for adopting a corrupt land redistribution policy that did not benefit the poor and landless. Pio Gama Pinto, a freedom fighter, Oginga Odinga‚Äôs chief tactician and link to the eastern bloc was assassinated on 25th February 1965 in what is recognised as Kenya‚Äôs first political assassination. Odinga became increasingly sidelined in government and was eventually compelled to resign and start his own political party ‚Äì the Kenya People‚Äôs Union (KPU). Several members of Parliament defected from the ruling party KANU to join KPU. A parliamentary by election ‚Äì the little general election ‚Äì was held in June 1966 that forced these members to defend their seats. Outside Nyanza Province, Oginga Odinga‚Äôs home turf, most KPU members including Bildad Kaggia lost their seats. Shortly after the formation of KPU, a security Act was passed in Parliament in July 1966 that permitted the government to carry out detention without trial ostensibly to maintain law and order in situations where the current order was threatened. This Act was immediately used against KPU members. K. Conboy. Detention without trial in Kenya. GEORGIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW Volume:8 Issue:2 Dated:(SPRING 1978) Pages:441-461M Two months after the election, In August 1966, a series of dawn raids by government police occurred.

In the Mud of Politics by Kiraitu Murungi. Nairobi. Acacia Stantex Publishers, 2000 Tom Mboya, one of the few remaining members of the Luo community in the upper echelons of government at the time, widely touted as the heir apparent to Kenyatta, was assassinated 6 months after Argwings death on 5th July 1969. The political tension in the country was at its peak and these events set the stage for the Kisumu massacre. The Massacre Four months after Tom Mboya‚Äôs assassination, President Kenyatta visited Kisumu, the capital of Nyanza Province in order to inaugurate the newly built New Nyanza Provincial General hospital, a Russian funded hospital. President Kenyatta sought to stamp his authority in Nyanza province amidst the tension. The crowd in attendance became hostile, openly challenging Kenyatta, showing support for KPU and accusing him of involvement in Tom Mboya's murder. A war of words ensued between Kenyatta and Oginga Odinga which stoked the embers further. A riot started. The Presidential guard and police opened fire. Several civilians, men women and children were shot. By official accounts 11 people lost their lives. Other sources quote figures as high as 100 civilians. Some of these victims were shot in Ahero and Awasi, up to 50Km away from the site of the actual riots. Several people were injured. The Aftermath Two days after the massacre, all KPU members of parliament and a number of prominent party supporters were arrested. The country's main opposition party, Kenya Peoples Union was banned, turning Kenya into a one party state. Oginga Odinga was placed under house arrest until 1971. Even after his release he never fully regained his political clout. Mak‚ÄôAnyengo, who was only released from earlier detention a year earlier, was arrested again and detained without trial until 1974. Jomo Kenyatta did not visit Nyanza Province again until his death in August 1978. His government downplayed the event. Almost all the photographic and film evidence from the day was destroyed. The government subsequently neglected the development of Nyanza Province, resulting in abject poverty and lowering of the standard of living. The political rivalry between the supporters of Jomo Kenyatta and Oginga Odinga has waxed and waned since then but never been resolved. The general election of 2017 and the subsequent post-election violence strangely echoed events in the 1960s. President Jomo Kenyatta‚Äôs son, Uhuru Kenyatta was running against Oginga Odinga‚Äôs son, Raila Odinga in the presidential election. Chris Msando, the head of IT and communication of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission was found tortured and murdered 12 days before the election amidst accusations that the incumbent party had plans to rig the elections. The election results were contested by Raila Odinga and his supporters. Demonstrations in Kisumu were violently suppressed by police, resulting in the death of civilians, including men, women and children not involved in the riots. Kenya Post-Election Killings, Abuse.

The union acquired the site of the compound in 1966, and the buildings were built in the ensuing years. The first building constructed on the property was a service station built in 1967, and several smaller service buildings were built soon afterward. The main building on the property, the Mission Revival styled Reuther Hall, was built from 1968 to 1969; the hall was named for United Auto Workers organizer Roy Reuther. A health care clinic and a retirement village were added to the property in the early 1970s. Background The Forty Acres is best known as the workplace of labor activist Cesar Chavez during the Delano grape strike of the 1960s. Chavez first drew national attention to the complex in 1968, when he conducted a public fast at the site. In 1970, union leaders and grape growers signed labor contracts ending the grape strike at Reuther Hall; the contracts unionized over 70,000 farmworkers working in the grape industry. After the strike, Chavez moved the union headquarters to a new complex; The Forty Acres continued to function as a service center for farmworkers and a local office for the union. The Forty Acres was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008.

The epicenter was located in Lushan County, Ya'an, Sichuan, about from Chengdu along the Longmenshan Fault in the same province heavily impacted by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The magnitude of the earthquake was placed at Ms 7.0 by China Earthquake Data Center, Ms 7.0 by Russian Academy of Sciences, Mw 7.0 by Geoscience Australia, Mw 6.6 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mw 6.6 by the European Alert System (EMSC) and Mj 6.9 by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). 1,815 aftershocks have been recorded as of 00:00 (UTC+8h) April 22.  Effects  The earthquake has resulted in 196 people dead, 24 missing, at least 11,826 injured with more than 968 seriously injured as of 5:00 PM (UTC+8h, April 20). Sichuan provincial government has held the 3rd press conference on April 21, reported that the earthquake has resulted in 186 people dead, 21 missing, 11248 injured and 852 of them seriously as of 2:00 PM (UTC+8h, April 21), this is still the latest official report. Several townships suffered major damage, and many old buildings in Lushan collapsed. The electricity service was interrupted, and the electricity grids in the counties of Baoxing, Lushan, and Tianquan disintegrated. Telecommunication was interrupted in part of Ya'an. The Chengdu‚ÄìYa'an and Ya'an‚ÄìXichang sections of the G5 Beijing‚ÄìKunming Expressway were reserved exclusively for vehicles for rescue purpose and closed to other vehicles. The Xiaojin section () of Sichuan Provincial Highway 210 between Baoshan () and Lushan was interrupted. A debris dam appeared in Jinjixia () of the Yuxi River () in Lushan. 2 volunteers were injured seriously in a traffic accident on the way to Lushan. However, around 60 giant pandas in the BiFengXia National Nature Reserve in Ya'an, were left unharmed by the devastating earthquake.  Lushan  The epicenter was located in Lushan. As of April 21, it was reported that 120 people died, 578 people were seriously injured, 5537 slightly injured, 278 saved from the ruins, and 3 still missing in Lushan County. The electricity grid disintegrated, and there were no water and gas services. According to China News Service, \\"100%\\" of houses in the 9 towns and townships and in the county seat were damaged.  Baoxing  As of April 21, it was reported that 24 people died, 2500 were injured, and 19 missing in Baoxing County. The electricity, water, and gas services were interrupted in the county seat. Most of houses in the county seat of Baoxing were uninhabitable. Water, medicines, and tents were urgently needed. Some rescuers had had to walk to Baoxing because major roads to there were cut off. On April 22, it was reported that the access to the county seat of Baoxing had been restored.  Rescue efforts  About 8,000 soldiers from the People's Liberation Army were sent into the stricken area in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, as well as 1,400 provincial rescue workers and 120 support vehicles. Also, 180 doctors from a Chinese emergency response team and search-and-rescue dogs were dispatched, with volunteers mobilized from other parts of the country. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang toured the area and emphasized the need for quick action. Officials warned that regional rainfall and aftershocks were factors complicating the rescue efforts, with potential secondary effects like additional landslides and further building collapses being concerns. Impassible roads and damaged communications infrastructure posed substantial challenges to rescue efforts.  Hong Kong donations controversy  Hong Kong chief executive, Leung Chun- ying, put forward a proposal to the Legislative Council to donate HK$100m ($13m) to the Sichuan provincial government for relief efforts. However, the government motion was vehemently opposed by legislators, in particular pan democrats, who feared that the local government would misuse the funds destined to help with earthquake relief efforts. Apparent signs of misappropriations or misuse by local officials of $HK9 billion donated after the earthquake in 2008 was cited as one major concern. The proposal failed to win support of Hong Kong people. An civic campaign was started online to try to stop earthquake donations falling into the hands of corrupt officials; and the liberal Apple Daily highlighted embezzlement scandals on the mainland. To satisfy the legislature, the Hong Kong government was forced to donate the money to registered Hong Kong non-governmental organisations.  Day of mourning  On April 25, the provincial government of Sichuan announced that April 27 (seven days after the occurrence of Lushan earthquake) would be the day of mourning for those that passed in earthquake. Public entertainment was forbidden, and the sound of siren wailed for 3 minutes to mourn the loss of earthquake. The domestic media also mourned the passed in different ways.Baidu Baidu changed its background of the page to black. The social media also developed a special feature about the Lushan earthquake.

The novel was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1980. An English translation was released in November 2012. Plot summary A US space mission in 1964 gathers a group of microbes in Earth orbit and are later recovered by American biowarfare researchers. Two microbes are found to be coccus-shaped supergerms capable of surviving in absolute zero and have the potential to grow exponentially in terrestrial conditions. One of the researchers, Dr Meyer, discovers the germ's regenerative ability and tries to stop work on the project. However, a sample of the germs is stolen and sent to Britain's Germ Warfare Research Laboratory in Porton Down for further development. In February 196X (actually implied as 1970, later to be known as the Year of the Calamity), a scientist at Porton Down smuggles a sample of the developed virus, codenamed MM88, and gives it to a group of men who have been tasked to bring it to Dr. Leisener, a Czech molecular biologist who is skilled at developing antidotes for it. The scientist, Dr. Karlsky, insists that the germ must never be exposed to warm temperatures. However, the men double-cross him and an assistant later kills him under the guise of a suicide. The group flies out of England bound for a rendezvous with US intelligence agents in Turkey. They never make it; their plane crashes into the Alps in the middle of a snowstorm and the vial holding the virus breaks open. The crash site is investigated but investigators could not link it with the theft of the virus. The virus, which is designed to piggyback with other existing illnesses and make them more lethal, begins to reproduce with the advent of spring in the Alps. Although some local communities have been reporting small animals suddenly dropping dead in their area, an Italian matinee idol's death in an auto crash in early March sparks media attention. His girlfriend dies shortly after a press conference eight days later, but not before she reveals that the actor died of a heart attack just before the accident despite being in good health. Several European countries are also reporting sudden deaths of important livestock. Over the second quarter, outbreaks of influenza and polio take place around the world, and news of random heart attacks even hog the papers. Another disease also kills off chickens and their eggs just when scientists needed to acquire large stocks of eggs for developing vaccines. The outbreaks of something called Tibetan flu begin to inflict massive casualties, with a number of countries reporting hundreds of thousands killed from random heart attacks. The Soviet Union's premier and vice-premier die of the illness, and Meyer is forcibly committed to the Sloan-Kettering Institute to prevent revealing the truth about the virus. Things are also worse in the scientific community; the fact that no one except the now-dead Porton Down researchers know of the existence of the space microbes (which have been suppressed for secrecy reasons) cripples efforts to develop a vaccine. Nearly all life on Earth are dead of the disease by the end of August. As the pandemic spreads worldwide, meanwhile, the staff of several international research stations in Antarctica begin to pool their resources towards creating a new society in the ice under the so-called \\"Supreme Council of Antarctica (SCA).\\" A scientist at Sloan-Kettering gets in touch with Dr. Meyer and is able to piece together all information about the virus for broadcast to the Antarctic bases before he dies. A US Polaris ballistic missile submarine, the USS Nereid, and a Soviet sub, the T-232, make contact with the SCA and are welcomed into an improvised submarine base in Hope Bay. Over the next four years, the community in Antarctica - an estimated 10,000 strong - gradually breaks down national affiliations and learn to live together while tapping the continent's natural resources. The large community only has 16 women - all of childbearing age, and the SCA moves to have them undergo consensual sex for procreation purposes. At the same time, the two submarines are sent on research duty around the world, giving Japanese seismologist Yoshizumi time to perfect a special method for predicting earthquakes. In late 1974, one of Yoshizumi's reports attract the SCA leadership's attention. He briefs them about a powerful earthquake somewhere in Alaska that is slated to take place in around spring 1975. Admiral Conway and Major Carter of the US reveals that the earthquake has the potential to destroy a Distant Early Warning Line station in the state and in the process trip the Automatic Reaction System (ARS), a command computer for the US strategic arsenal. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Garland activated the system before his death in the closing stages of the pandemic. The two American officers admit that the ARS was borne out of hardline anti-Soviet policies; a new regime that took office in 1969 was working towards a nuclear disarmament deal with the Soviets around the time of the pandemic. The Soviet contingent admits that some of their missiles may be targeted at a now-decommissioned US rocket base in Antarctica. In a special mission codenamed Operation Fireman, Yoshizumi and Major Carter volunteer to go to the ARS command bunker underneath the White House; two Soviet volunteers go to Moscow aboard the T-232 to shut down their own version of the ARS. Yoshizumi and Major Carter - who have been inoculated by French scientist Dr Henri Louis De la Tour with an experimental vaccine derived from samples of the virus irradiated with neutron energy - arrive in Washington at roughly the same time as the Alaska earthquake. They scramble to get down to the ARS bunker - just as the system goes into firing status. Already reeling from the pain of a snake bite and seeing a young skeleton resembling his dead daughter, Carter commits suicide and Yoshizumi stays in the bunker, alerting the Nereid to head for open water immediately as he sits out the nuclear exchange. The Soviet team's fate is left unknown, although it is later revealed by de la Tour that no Soviet missiles hit Antarctica and most of the warheads were actually neutron weapons; their radioactive rays mutate the virus into a form that does not affect humans. It is implied that the Nereid survived the nuclear strike. Two advance parties of survivors arrive in southern Argentina over the winter of 1978 and 1979. A third and much bigger group of survivors follow in December 1979. This group is stunned to see Yoshizumi emerge from hiding nearby - he spent the past several years trekking all the way from Washington, proving that de la Tour's vaccine worked. In August 1980, ten full years after the pandemic, the human colony in Argentina prepares to send an exploration team into the interior. Characters Japanese *Yoshizumi - A seismologist assigned to Showa Station in 1970, Yoshizumi is the novel's leading protagonist. He stays in the Antarctic all throughout the pandemic. In the novel's prologue set in March 1973, Yoshizumi actually considered emerging from the surface of Tokyo Bay to die but is pulled away at the last minute. After the nuclear exchange, he travels south, working his way down the US East Coast to Texas and crossed the Panama Canal by 1977. He eventually recovers from exhaustion after the survivors find him. *Tatsuno - One of Yoshizumi's colleagues at Showa Station, Tatsuno gradually cracks under the strain of tuning into the base's ham radio to receive any broadcasts from around the world. He is mentally unstable after a failed attempt to talk to a young boy in Arizona - the boy does not receive his signals and commits suicide. *Noriko - Yoshizumi's girlfriend, Noriko is a newspaper reporter who is strained from covering the pandemic. She dies of the disease at her condo in August thinking of Yoshizumi. Americans *President Silverland - A rabid anti-communist and the penultimate president of the US from 1965 to 1969, Silverland built up his administration with a singular desire to destroy the USSR, in an apparent reversal of the Kennedy administration's hopes for peace. This paranoia later contributed to Silverland being voted out of office in the 1968 elections. His unnamed successor then took a more peaceful stance, even planning to sign a global nuclear disarmament treaty with the USSR and other nuclear states if not for the pandemic. *General Garland - The chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time of the pandemic, Garland was a lieutenant-general when Silverland worked with him to develop the ARS in 1966. Although the regime that took office in 1969 reversed Silverland's anti-Soviet policies, the ARS remained active and Garland forcibly took the access keys from the president and vice- president as they died. He dies as well at the ARS command bunker - but not before activating the system. *Admiral Conway - the commander of the US Antarctic contingent, Conway was originally part of the US operation to establish a space rocket base in Antarctica - which is actually an IRBM base targeting Soviet allies in Africa and South America. Once the SCA is established, he emerges as its de facto leader and manages the entire community with help from several officials from the former nations. *Major Carter - A US Army major, Carter was revealed to have been part of the ARS development team and was assigned to the US Antarctic group to keep tabs on Admiral Conway. He volunteers to go with Yoshizumi to Washington to shut down the ARS, but later commits suicide. *Captain McCloud - the Nereid's skipper, McCloud is contacted by the SCA and asked to send his sub to the Antarctic. The Nereid is actually one of two US subs contacted to head to the Antarctic - McCloud is ordered to sink the second sub after its skipper reports infection among the crew. Soviets *Dr Borodinov - The head of the Soviet Antarctic Wintering Team, Borodinov is the SCA council's vice-chairman. *Capt Nevsky - A representative of the Soviet Defense Ministry, Nevsky reveals the existence of a Soviet counterpart to the ARS housed in the Kremlin. Like Major Carter, he volunteers to turn it off but his fate is left unknown. *Irma - A middle-aged woman, she is one of the 16 women who are tapped as surrogate mothers to continue the human race. She eventually falls for Yoshizumi before he leaves for Operation Fireman. Film adaptation A movie adaptation of the novel was released by Kadokawa Films in 1980 with Masao Kusakari as Yoshizumi. The movie was shot in several locations including Antarctica and Machu Picchu in Peru. Much of the novel's material was adjusted for the film. Some of the changes include: *Changing the setting for the bioweapons lab from Porton Down to a secret base in East Germany. *The actual exposition of the air crash in the mountains. *Noriko being rewritten as a nurse instead of a newspaper reporter. *The size of the Antarctic community being reduced from 10,000 to only 863 people total. *The Nereid ordered to sink the T-232. *The name of the disease changed from \\"Tibetan flu\\" to \\"Italian flu\\", following the initial spreading of the virus in Northern Italy. English version Viz Media imprint Haikasoru released an English version of the novel in November 2012. Translated by Daniel Huddleston, the novel is 312 pages long.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-20/viz-media- haikasoru-imprint-releases-new-sci-fi-novel-virus The Sakyo Komatsu Office and the IO Corporation awarded the translation rights with help from the Japan Foreign Rights Center.

As the name indicates, the event commemorated the 50th anniversary of the debut of Manuel Gonz√°lez Rivera, better known under the ring name Dr. Wagner, as well as the 7th anniversary of his death on September 13, 2004. The show was produced as a joint effort between International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Promocion Wagner, owned and operated by Gonz√°lez's son who wrestles as Dr. Wagner, Jr. The show included both sons of Dr. Wagner competing in the main event as Dr. Wagner, Jr., and Silver King competed in a match where the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship was on the line as well as the masks of Dr. Wagner, Jr., and the remaining competitors, La Parka and Taboo. Background The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers, where some were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others simply put together by the matchmakers without a backstory. Being a professional wrestling event matches are not won legitimately through athletic competition; they are instead won via predetermined outcomes to the matches that is kept secret from the general public. Wrestlers portray either heels (the bad guys, referred to as Rudos in Mexico) or faces (fan favorites or T√©cnicos in Mexico). Manuel Gonz√°lez Rivera made his professional wrestling debut on July 16, 1961 under the ring name Centella Negra, in 1962 he adopted the ring name he would become world-famous under, Dr. Wagner. As Dr. Wagner he became one of the top performers in Mexico for a long period of time until he was forced to retire on April 27, 1986 after a car accident. Gonz√°lez became the patriarch of a wrestling family that at the time of the show spanned three generations as both his sons became wrestlers as well, the oldest working as Dr. Wagner, Jr., and the youngest wrestling as Silver King / Silver Cain. The third generation Dinastia Wagner began wrestling in 2009 as El Hijo de Dr. Wagner made his debut. Manuel Gonz√°lez died in 2004. Dr. Wagner, Jr.'s independent promotion Promociones Wagner joined up with IWRG in late 2011 to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Dr. Wagner's debut, a collaboration made possible through Dr. Wagner, Jr.'s employer Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), who had a solid working relationship with IWRG that allowed the two smaller promotions to collaborate on the event. The show featured a mixture of IWRG, AAA and freelance wrestlers as well as wrestlers who were being trained by Dr. Wagner, Jr., at the time. Aftermath Taboo held the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until December 25, 2011 when he lost it to Headhunter A as part of IWRG's Christmas show.

Background After defeating Riddick Bowe in a closely contested rematch to regain his WBA, IBF and Lineal Heavyweight titles, Holyfield had hoped for a unification match with the WBC Heavyweight Champion Lennox Lewis. Instead, the WBA and IBF demanded Holyfield face the mandatory challenger, undefeated southpaw Michael Moorer. The fight In a shocking upset, Moorer would defeat Holyfield via majority decision with judges Jerry Roth and Chuck Giampa giving Moorer the victory by the scores of 115‚Äì114 and 116‚Äì112 respectively, while Dalby Shirley scored the fight even at 114‚Äì114. In the second round, Moorer was in control of the fight until Holyfield caught him with a left hook that dropped Moorer to the canvas. Though earning a knockdown would usually result in a round win for the fighter, judge Jerry Roth scored the round even at 10‚Äì10 instead of 10‚Äì9 which would have made the fight a majority draw in which Holyfield would have kept his titles. Holyfield's manager Shelly Finkel would protest the round, but the decision was upheld., L.A. Times article, 1994-04-24, Retrieved on 2013-04-19. Aftermath Evander Holyfield was hospitalized after the fight for dehydration and a rotator-cuff injury. While at the hospital, a kidney bruise was found and he was given large amounts of liquid to help treat the injury. However, Holyfield was soon found to have a heart problem after his lungs filled due to his heart not being able to pump the fluids out. As a result, Holyfield announced his retirement only five days after the fight on April 27, 1994., N.Y. Times article, 1994-04-27, Retrieved on 2013-04-19. Holyfield's retirement, however, would be brief as he would return the following year to defeat Ray Mercer. After Moorer's victory there was talk of a potential Michael Moorer‚ÄìLennox Lewis fight. However, Moorer would instead chose to put his newly won titles on the line against 45-year- old ex-Heavyweight champion George Foreman. Though Moorer was ahead on the judges scorecards, Foreman was able to land a short right hand to Moorer's chin, earning the victory by way of knockout and ending Moorer's first reign as champion. On November 11, 1997, Holyfield and Moorer would meet in a rematch. By this time, Holyfield had regained the WBA Heavyweight title by twice defeating Mike Tyson while Moorer had regained the vacant IBF Heavyweight title after defeating Axel Schulz. This time it would be Holyfield who would earn the victory, sending Moorer to the canvas five times before Mitch Halpern stopped the fight after round 8 and awarded Holyfield the victory via referee technical decision.

The event was the eleventh show held under the El Castillo del Terror banner, with the first taking place in 2000. The main event was the eponymous Castillo del Terror (Spanish for \\"Castle of Terror\\") Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to take off his mask per the match stipulation. Production Background Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\") to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2011 Castillo del Terror show was the seventh year in a row that IWRG promoted a show under that name. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The Main Event of the show was a 10-Man Steel Cage Match where wrestlers could climb out of the cage to escape. The last two wrestlers who remained in the ring would be forced to fight one-on-one in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet match\\", wagering their mask on the outcome of the match. The event included wrestlers from International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and a number of Mexican Freelance wrestlers. The undercard featured a Relevos Suicidas, losing team advances tag team match between the teams of Oficial AK-47 and Apolo Estrada, Jr. facing off against Eterno and Multifac√©tico. The losing team would have to wrestle against each other immediately after the match, with each wrestler \\"betting\\" something on the outcome of the match. Oficial AK-47, Apolo Estrada, Jr. and Multifac√©tico all put their hair on the line while Eterno put the WWS World Welterweight Championship on the line on the outcome of the match.

As of 2013, there are 33,930 Eritrean-born citizens living in the U.S. History An Eritrean restaurant in San Francisco. Eritrea got its independence from Ethiopia on May 24, 1991, after the Eritrean War of Independence. Since the inception of the war in the 1960s many immigrants from Eritrea left for the United States. By 2000, the Eritrean community in the U.S. had grown to around 30,000 members. Eritrean Americans have since established ethnic enclaves in various places around the country, particularly in the Washington D.C. area. Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, California has come to be known as Little Ethiopia, owing to its many Ethiopian and Eritrean businesses and restaurants. The Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California has many Ethiopian and Eritrean businesses and restaurants. Additionally, Eritreans have opened a number of garages and auto repair shops. They also run several taxi establishments, including the Eritrean Cab company based in San Diego. Also the 100% Eritrean owned Indy Airport Taxi located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Demographics The exact number of Eritrean residents in the United States is unknown because Eritreans were Ethiopian nationals prior to Eritrea's independence in the early 1990s. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 18,917 people reported Eritrean ancestry in 2000. Between 2007 and 2011, there were approximately 25,848 Eritrea-born residents in the country. California had the most Eritrean-born people, at 4,782 residents, followed by Virginia (3,417), Texas (2,693), and Maryland (1,902). Most Eritrean immigrants are concentrated in Washington D.C.,Arizona and California, especially the San Francisco Bay Area. The community also has a notable presence in the Seattle, Columbus, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Houston, Denver and Dallas metropolitan areas. Community organizations Greater New York. The Eritrean community in the United States is represented by various Eritrean-run organizations. Among these are the Eritrean American Community Association of Georgia, Eritrean American Community in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, Eritrean Community Center of Greater New York, Eritrean American Community in Dallas, Eritrean Community Association in Chicago, Eritrean Association in Greater Seattle, and Eritrean American Community in Sacramento. In 2001, a chapter of the Eritrean Liberation Front‚ÄìRevolutionary Council was also established in Chicago. The National Union of Eritrean Women likewise routinely holds meetings and activities in the city. Additionally, the Virginia-based Eritrean Sports Federation in North America (ERSFNA) annually hosts a soccer tournament for Eritrean residents. It also organizes adult and youth sports community programs in various U.S. cities.

Located near the community of Maunie in White County, the site has received recognition from the federal government because of its archaeological value. Due to the lack of recent excavations, the site's dates of habitation are debated, ranging from 400 BC in some estimates to AD 1000 in others, but all agree on the site's significance to understanding the prehistory of the region. Geography Hubele lies approximately west of the Wabash River, above its confluence with the Ohio River, on land only minimally higher than the riverbank; the site may once have been a riverside sandbar. The site forms part of massive farm fields along the river; a levee on the eastern edge protects the site from flooding,Bodner, Connie. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hubele Mounds and Village Site. National Park Service, 1976-07. and a line of trees marks the site's northern edge. Besides the levee, which may sit atop part of the site, historical disturbances to the site have included the construction of a road on the southern edge and the placement of a drainage ditch; however, all of these influences have disturbed less than one-sixth of the site. Features Originally, the site was distinguished by a group of seven earthworks, small mounds placed in a north- south line. None of the mounds have survived intact to the present; two were excavated by archaeologists from the Illinois State Museum, and the other five have been worn down by repeated plowing, leaving even the highest less than tall. Located east of the mounds, the village site has yielded evidence of numerous features, including postholes, trash pits, and fire pits; many of these have been uncovered by routine plowing. Excavation The Illinois State Museum sponsored a two-part excavation project at Hubele in 1950; archaeologists dug a pair of test trenches (each measuring ) in the village area and removed two of the mounds, which were found to have been previously disturbed. Both loci produced various types of artifacts: surface collection in the village found projectile points, pottery, knives and flakes of flint, and bones and shells, while the soil under the mound was found to contain a distinctive pipestone pipe, additional potsherds, and projectile points from the prolific flint quarries of Harrison County, Indiana. More than two thousand grog-tempered sherds were found in the test trenches, including some that bore no markings at all; it is uncertain whether the plain sherds were originally plain or if they were decorated pieces that had lost their original markings.Rohm, Mackenzie Smyth Caldwell. A Terminal Middle Woodland Ceramic Complex from Southern Illinois. Thesis Southern Illinois University Carbondale, 2008. Cultural affiliation Disputes have arisen over the proper interpretation of pottery from Hubele. The original State Museum researchers identified the villagers as Hopewellian peoples from the Middle Woodland period, as the majority of sherds were of the Hopewellian style known as Crab Orchard; in the southern Wabash Valley, this date translates to a period from approximately 400 BC to AD 400. It is one of just four mound sites in southern Illinois that is generally considered to be Hopewellian, along with the nearby Wilson Mounds and Village Site, the Rutherford Site at the mouth of the Saline River, and the Twenhafel Site near the Mississippi River. However, its date, like those of the other three, is uncertain, because no substantial work has been conducted at Hubele since radiocarbon dating became practical. Howard Winters of the State Museum rejected the previous studies' view of the latest occupation of the site; a 1963 archaeological survey under his leadership suggested that Hubele was affiliated with the Duffy Complex. If Hubele were related to the Duffy people, its location would be crucial: only three sites have conclusively been identified as Duffy, and all lie within ten miles of the mouth of the Wabash, so Hubele would represent the northernmost known location of the complex, which inhabited the region circa AD 1000 during the transition out of the Woodland period under Mississippian influence.Winters, Howard D. An Archaeological Survey of the Wabash Valley in Illinois. Springfield: Illinois State Museum Society, 1963. Yet later studies suggested a connection with other late Hopewellian complexes, such as the Havana Hopewell and the people of the Mann Site in far southwestern Indiana. Consequently, solid identification of the site as Duffy-related would raise the site's importance even higher by demonstrating its occupation over many centuries, as well as making it just the fourth site so to be identified, after the type site, the Duffy Site in Gallatin County, and the Pepper and Little Chain sites in White County. Even if further research disproves the concept of a Duffy connection, Hubele will remain significant; its connection to the nearby Hopewellian Wilson Mounds at Rising Sun is undisputed, so it appears to be one of the most important villages associated with the mound group. Preservation In August 1978, the Hubele Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its archaeological significance. The landmark's boundaries encompassed six contributing properties (the five mounds and the site as a whole) over of land. It is one of eleven National Register-listed locations in White County, along with the Wilson and Bieker-Wilson archaeological sites.

Quarles, 467 U.S. 649 (1984), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court regarding the public safety exception to the normal Fifth Amendment requirements of the Miranda warning.  Background  The Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place in an open but empty grocery store. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \\"The gun is over there\\". The suspect was not prosecuted for rape, but was charged with criminal possession of a weapon. However, he argued that his statement (\\"The gun is over there\\") was inadmissible in evidence because he had not first been given the Miranda warning. Since the gun was found as a direct result of the statement, he argued that the presence of the gun was also inadmissible, making it impossible to convict him.  Judgment  In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found that the jurisprudential rule of Miranda must yield in \\"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\\". The rule of Miranda is not, therefore, absolute and can be a bit more elastic in cases of public safety. Under this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \\"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist,\\" and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \\"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety.\\" The suspect's unadvised statement was therefore admissible in evidence because \\"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\\".New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649 (1984).  Dissent  Justice Marshall, joined by Justices Brennan and Stevens, rejected the idea of a public safety exception: :It would strain credulity to contend that Officer Kraft's questioning of respondent Quarles was not coercive. In the middle of the night and in the back of an empty supermarket, Quarles was surrounded by four armed police officers. His hands were handcuffed behind his back. The first words out of the mouth of the arresting officer were: \\"Where is the gun?\\" [...] Officer Kraft's abrupt and pointed question pressured Quarles in precisely the way that the Miranda Court feared the custodial interrogations would coerce self-incriminating testimony. [...] :Until today, this Court could truthfully state that the Fifth Amendment is given \\"broad scope\\" \\"[w]here there has been genuine compulsion of testimony.\\" Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 417 U. S. 440 (1974). Coerced confessions were simply inadmissible in criminal prosecutions. The \\"public safety\\" exception departs from this principle by expressly inviting police officers to coerce defendants into making incriminating statements, and then permitting prosecutors to introduce those statements at trial. Though the majority's opinion is cloaked in the beguiling language of utilitarianism, the Court has sanctioned sub silentio criminal prosecutions based on compelled self-incriminating statements. I find this result in direct conflict with the Fifth Amendment's dictate that \\"[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\\" Furthermore, even if a public safety exception was allowed, he believed it would have been inapplicable in this particular case: :[T]here was no evidence that the interrogation was prompted by the arresting officers' concern for the public's safety. [...] [N]o customers or employees were wandering about the store in danger of coming across Quarles' discarded weapon. Although the supermarket was open to the public, Quarles' arrest took place during the middle of the night, when the store was apparently deserted except for the clerks at the check-out counter. The police could easily have cordoned off the store and searched for the missing gun. Had they done so, they would have found the gun forthwith. Justice O'Connor filed a separate opinion, also rejecting the idea of a public safety exception, but arguing that the presence of the gun itself should still be admissible evidence.

Plot The game stars Snops, a decorated, heroic canine military veteran and pilot (who navigates an Alpha Wolf X1 fighter jet) who is on a mission to eradicate a zombie epidemic which has invaded the world and transformed everyone into zombies. Mike Walz (the game‚Äôs designer) dedicated Snops Attack! to the memory of his dog Snoopy/Snoppy, of which he based the game‚Äôs protagonist Snops after. Development Snops battling an enemy UFO through a zombified forest. Snops Attack! was originally conceived when web designer Mike Walz was experimenting in SilverLight with the idea for web development on a SHMUP. When he decided that he truly wanted to make a SHMUP, he came across XNA Game Studio Express and signed on for the $100 Microsoft Creator‚Äôs Club membership. Development was done primarily by Walz over a span of ten months, with him handling the coding, visuals/sprites (all hand-drawn) and music. His main goal was making sure that the game ran at a consistent, silky- smooth 60fps (which Walz achieved), as he strongly opposed the idea of it running at 30fps. Walz states that his biggest challenge during development was drawing and animating each and every sprite for Snops Attack! by himself, and describes it as an extremely \\"time consuming\\" process. Walz cites old- school shoot 'em ups such as Twin Cobra, Thunder Force, Soldier Blade and Blazing Lazers as large influences on him growing up. He is in particular, a huge fan of the shmups from the Toaplan era. Reception Snops Attack! Zombie Defense has been well-received. The game ranked at number five on IndieGame.com's Top 10 Xbox Live Indie Games of 2012, noting that it stands among as one of the best (shmups) in its crowd.

The body is covered by a thick exoskeleton and a pair of thick wing covers lay atop another set of membranous wings underneath, allowing the beetle to fly, although not very efficiently, owing to its large size. The flying season is usually in September, when most of the males usually appear to wait for copulation. Its length is 50‚Äì95 mm. As a larva, its diet is rotten wood.

European chub, an invasive species The wildlife of Chechnya includes a range of flora and fauna as reflected by its varying topographic and climatic conditions, with the Greater Caucasus to the south, the foreland zone the Terek and Sunza river valleys in the west and east, and the rolling plains of Nogai steppe in the north. Lake Kezenoyam in Chechnya is near the border with Dagestan and can sustain plankton growth. Salmo ezenami, a rare species of trout now critically endangered due to introduction of the invasive species European chub (Squalius cephalus), is native only to this lake and is therefore endemic to Lake Kezenoyam. About twenty percent of Chechnya is covered by beech, birch, hornbeam and oak forest. In the north, desert and semi-desert vegetation is noted, including sagebrush, saltwort and feather- grass. Acorns, wild fruits, berry bushes, medicinal herbs and mushrooms are recorded on the left bank of the Terek River. Deciduous forests are noted at elevations of , while sub-alpine and alpine meadows are noted at higher elevations. In the Terek‚ÄìKuma Lowland, there are approximately 50 species of mammals and 150 types of birds. Geography Terek River border between Chechnya and Dagestan. The terrain of Chechnya, which is landlocked, is distinctly marked by of four zones - the northern plains, the Terek Zanzua ridges, the Chechen plains and the Caucasian mountains to the south. The major rivers which drain the country are the Terek, the Sunzha, the Argun and the Assa, rise in the glaciers covered high hills and form the main Terek basin. There are few other rivers also. The Terek and the Sunzha Rivers flows across the country from west to the east forming broad valleys which forms the foreland region of the country. The highest mountain is Tebulosmta with an elevation of 14,741 feet (4,493 metres), and the Argun river rises here and joins the Sunzha River. The undulating plains of the Nogay Steppe are in the northern part of the country. The habitats are in the mountain ridges, valleys and depressions which form about 33% of the total area of the country. The balance of the area is formed of plains interspersed with highlands. A strip of mountains occupies the entire the southern part of the country and is spread over a hilly area 30‚Äì50 km wide. The Terek-Kuma semi desert has dry climate. The Bokovoy Ridges, which are covered with snow, has a cold and humid climate. Accordingly, the semi desert lowland zone experiences an average temperature of -3 ¬∞C in January and 25 ¬∞C in July while the highlands (mountain region) experience a low of -12 ¬∞C in January and a high of 21 ¬∞C in July. The average annual precipitation is reported as 300-1,000 mm. Protected areas Chechnya has a number of protected areas that vary in extent from 12,000 to 100,000 ha. One of Chechnya's largest reserves is the Shatoi Reserve, which includes more than 20,000 hectares of forest land; it adjoins the Vedeno Reserve. The reserve lies between the Chanti-Argun and Sharo-Argun Rivers. The dominant vegetation consists of valuable trees, and berry bushes, nut trees, herbal plants (medicinal and melliferous) and also mushrooms. Other reserves include the Urus-Martan, Shali, and Argun reserves. Flora The vegetation in the country consists of semi-desertic sagebrush species in the Nogai Steppe, which also has no vegetation in its sand dunes. Feather-grass steppe and chestnut species are found in black earth soils and in the Terek River and Sunzha River regions, with beech, hornbeam, and oak forming broad-leaved dense forests on the mountain slopes. Above 6,500 feet, the vegetation type changes to coniferous forests succeeded by alpine meadows at further higher elevations. Other plant species noted in the country are yew-trees, pine, apple, cherry, pear, berry, wild strawberry, and ramsons. Fauna The species recorded in Chechnya include brown bears (500), wolves (1100), Eurasian lynx (a few), foxes (1300), jackals (1200), bezoar ibexes, Eastern Caucasian tur, European wildcats, chamois, roe deer, wild boar, otters, raccoons, martens, hares, moles, ermines, and grass snakes. Avifauna 242 species of birds have been reported in Chechnya, of which three (the red-breasted goose, white-winged lark, and black lark) are breeding endemics, 10 are globally endangered, and one (the yellow-browed warbler) is introduced. The endangered species are: * Vanellus gregarius, sociable plover (CR) * Branta ruficollis, red-breasted goose (EN) * Oxyura leucocephala, white-headed duck (EN) * Neophron percnopterus, Egyptian vulture (EN) * Anser erythropus, lesser white-fronted goose (VU) * Marmaronetta angustirostris, marbled teal (VU) * Pelecanus crispus, Dalmatian pelican (VU) * Clanga clanga, greater spotted eagle (VU) * Aquila heliaca, eastern imperial eagle (VU) * Otis tarda, great bustard (VU) Gallery File:–ö–µ–∑–µ–Ω–æ–π-–∞–º.jpgLake Kezenoy File:–ü–µ–π–∑–∞–∂ –≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ.jpgTerek River in Russia References Chechnya Category:Chechnya ","title":"Wildlife of Chechnya"},{"id":"39163689","text":"Mark William Osler (born 1963) is an American legal scholar, law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, and critic of narcotics policy and capital punishment in the United States. He holds the Robert and Marion Short Distinguished Chair in Law at St. Thomas. Background and Career Born in Detroit, Michigan, Osler attended Grosse Pointe North High School in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan and subsequently matriculated at College of William & Mary, graduating in 1985. Osler received his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1990 and clerked for District Court Judge Jan DuBois in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania before returning to Detroit. There, he worked from 1992-1995 for the law firm of Dykema Gossett, and then as an Assistant United States Attorney from 1995-2000. He began work as a law professor at Baylor University in 2000 before leaving for St. Thomas in 2010. At St. Thomas, he founded the nation's first law school clinic on federal commutations, and he has advocated for an expansive use of the presidential pardon power. His work has been profiled by The American Prospect, Rolling Stone and CBS News. Osler's recent work has focused on clemency and narcotics policy. His opinion pieces have appeared in both The New York Times, and the Washington Post, while his arguments in favor of narcotics policy reform appeared in law journals at Harvard, Stanford, Georgetown, Rutgers, and DePaul. An article Osler co-authored with Rachel Barkow for the University of Chicago Law Review was highlighted in a lead editorial in The New York Times, in which the Times' editorial board expressly embraced Barkow and Osler's argument for clemency reform. He and Barkow also co-founded the Clemency Resource Center at NYU. Some of Osler's work has addressed sentencing issues involving crack cocaine. In 2009, Osler won the case (through a 6-3 summary and per curiam decision) of Spears v. United States in the United States Supreme Court, which reversed the Eighth Circuit and clarified a prior sentencing decision, declaring that sentencing judges could \\"categorically\\" reject the 100-to-1 ration between powder and crack cocaine which was then embedded in the federal sentencing guidelines. In his scholarship and advocacy, Osler often explicitly addresses Christian audiences, and he holds the Ruthie Mattox Chair of Preaching at First Covenant Church, Minneapolis. https://news.stthomas.edu/professor-mark-osler-named-ruthie-mattox-preaching- chair-first-covenant-church/ Osler is the author of Jesus on Death Row (Abingdon, 2009), which critiques capital punishment in the United States through an examination of the biblical account of Jesus Christ's trial and execution. Following up on the book, Osler and collaborators produced a dramatic \\"Sentencing of Jesus\\" in eleven states: Texas, Colorado, California, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Illinois, Virginia, Louisiana, Arizona, and Minnesota. His 2016 book, Prosecuting Jesus recounts that project. He has also commented on the death penalty and other issues for CNN, MSNBC, NPR, ESPN, and the Huffington Post. The character of \\"Professor Joe Fisher\\" in the film American Violet is based on Osler, and he appeared as a critic of narcotics policy in the 2013 National Geographic series \\"The 80's,\\" and as a commentator in the 2014 National Geographic series \\"The Jesus Mysteries.\\" He is a founding member of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, a national group of former and current prosecutors and police chiefs.http://lawenforcementleaders.org/members/ Osler was also the lawyer for Weldon Angelos, who was freed in 2016 after serving 12 years of a 55-year sentence on a marijuana and gun possession conviction.

Description The station is located about west of Winton and east of Middleton in Central West Queensland. It is located in the Channel Country and is bisected from north to south by the Diamantina River. The north east corner is well watered by Wokingham Creek. For a few decades in the late 19th century, there was another town right near the station called Collingwood, but this had become a ghost town by 1900. Composed of open plains vegetated with Mitchell grass interspersed with areas of gidgee, coolibah and boree woodlands. The area is very flat interrupted only by Mount Booka Booka and its surrounding hills. Oondooroo station once bordered Elderslie. Elderslie Station lies at the eastern rim of a roughly circular zone measuring some 130 km across that has been identified by Geoscience Australia as a crustal anomaly. Proof is currently lacking as to the cause, but it is believed likely that the anomaly was caused by an asteroid strike that happened about 300 million years ago. History John McKinlay and his party would have trekked through the area in 1862, while searching for the Burke and Wills expedition, following the banks to the Diamantina to where it met Middleton Creek en route to the Gulf of Carpentaria. This point later became the boundary of the Elderslie. William Landsborough also passed through in 1866 and described the land as well grassed in season but stocking it could be difficult through lack of surface water. In 1873, William Forsayth took up three blocks fronting the Diamantina and Western Rivers covering some and named the run Doveridge. The first sheep arrived at the property in mid-1874 and then later the same year Forsayth transferred the lease to Donald Wallace, a Victorian pastoralist, who began to acquire surrounding blocks until the area was , encompassing the land where Winton is located all the way to Middleton Creek. By 1879, Wallace owned the property outright, and by 1881, a stone homestead was constructed along with several outbuildings. Sir Samuel Wilson bought the property some time prior to 1878. By 1887, the property was advertised as occupying an area of and held 40,000 sheep, 13,000 cattle, and 250 horses. The adjoining properties included Warnambool Downs, Vindex, Ayrshire Downs, and Dagworth Stations. At the time, the lease had of double frontage to the Western River and over of double frontage to Middleton Creek with of fencing having been installed. In 1891, the property had 70,000 sheep and 20,000 head of cattle depastured, and was still owned by Samuel Wilson. The woolshed burnt down later the same year. Banjo Paterson was thought to have worked at Elderslie as a jackeroo or storekeeper in 1895, at about the time he wrote \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", while visiting nearby Dagworth Station. The property was sold in 1896 by the executors of Wilson's estate to the Ramsay brothers. An engineer named Douglas Hutchinson drowned when he tried to cross the Diamantina River in 1901. In 1912, the size of the station was , and held a flock of about 112,000 sheep. The property was sold by the then owners, the Ramsay brothers, for ¬£110,000. It had been acquired by Mr. C. J. Brabazon, who had recently sold Warenda Station and began improving his new run by employing about 100 men to work on fencing and other projects. The first commercial flight in the Northern Territory by Qantas carried Mr. C. J. Brabazon from Elderslie to Austral Downs, another property he owned, in 1921. The property was sold in 1924 by the Queensland Stock and Breeders Company to a Southern company, Australian Estates and Mortgage Company, that already had large interests in Queensland. The sale included the 80,000 sheep with which the property was stocked, along with all plant and equipment. At this time the station occupied an area of . By 1933, the size of the property was and it was staffed by about 36 people. Heavy rains inundated the area in 1940, causing extensive flooding further down the Diamantina. In 1950, the property was sold by the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company and was then divided into seven separate grazing properties which were opened up for selection by the ballot process. The Elderslie leasehold was reduced to a size of and purchased by John Dixon, who sold again in 1954 to Keith Watts for five shillings per acre. Watts started to carry out repairs on the homestead which were later classified by the National Trust. A drover drowned while trying to ford the swollen Workingham Creek in 1955. During the 1980s, the roof of the manager's house was damaged during storms, resulting in the deterioration of the building. In October 1992, the Elderslie Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. The property was still owned by the Watts family in 2011 and was stocked with a flock of 5300 sheep and 800 cattle.

Biography Pe≈Çczycki was the son of the Bishop of Chelm, Zacharias. In 1577, his father gave up the office, and gave his son all rights to manage the Eparchy of Chelm. Three years later Bishop Leontius took the Chirotonia, thus being consecrated as bishop. In 1585, a decree of Stephen B√°thory granted him privilege of the Pinsk-Turowski Cathedral. The royal document stated that Leontius gave the king considerable benefices. It is that, like some powerful intercession, that led to his appointment as Bishop of Pinsk-Turowski. In the second document, the king confirmed the privileges of his predecessors Eparchy and slowed payment of municipal taxes and fees to the county. In disputes about Orthodox benefices, the Bishop fought with Radziwills and the descendants of King Ivan Horodecki advocated on his side. In 1588 the B√°thory's successor, King Sigismund III Vasa, at the request of Bishop Leontius, named Athanasius Terlecki superior of the Leszczynski monastery and gave him the right of succession following Leontius' death. Later that year, however, Terlecki received the privilege of appointing him the Archbishop of Polotsk. The Leszczynski Monastery became directly subordinate to the bishop of Pinsk-Turowski. Conflicts with townspeople Leontius did not enjoy the respect of the faithful, as he led a lavish lifestyle and neglected his eparchy, caring mostly about family interests. Repeatedly he fell into conflict with the townspeople. His work also assessed the patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II, who in 1589, during his stay in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, learned about the Bishop's tolerance of low morals among the clergy, including illegal re-canonical ordination of priests. Jeremiah forbade the clergy exercise of worship and the bishop threatened to deprive Pe≈Çczycki of his office absent reform. Orthodox Bishops Councils In 1590 in Belz Leontius took part in the two councils of Orthodox bishops of the Republic to discuss the issue of a possible unification of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. In June of this year, together with the bishops of Chelm, Dionysius (Zbyruyskyy), of Lutsk, Cyril Terlecki and Lviv, Hedeon Balaban he intended to convert to Catholicism while maintaining the Byzantine Rite. Information about this decision was not communicated to the faithful for fear of their reaction, and another council in Brest in 1591 was silent on issues of church union. On 2 December 1594 Leontius Pe≈Çczycki took part in a meeting with the Bishop of Lutsk Bernard Maciejowski, during which they discussed the proposed union, signing a collegiate letter of rejection of the union and the recognition of papal authority. On June 12, 1595 he signed the agreement on accession to the Union with the Roman church. Leontius was killed in an accident in August 1595 when he fell out of his carriage. On 8 October 1595, a decree was promulgated concerning the Russian union with the Roman Church at the Cathedral of Brest. He was buried in the Monastery of Leszno in Pinsk. References *Mironowicz A.

A sweetened beverage is any beverage with added sugar. It has been described as \\"liquid candy\\". Consumption of sweetened beverages has been linked to weight gain, obesity, and associated health risks. According to the CDC, consumption of sweetened beverages is also associated with unhealthy behaviors like smoking, not getting enough sleep and exercise, and eating fast food often and not enough fruits regularly. Sugar- related health concerns A number of studies suggest that there is a significant correlation between increased consumption of sweetened beverages and weight gain leading to obesity. There has also been an association between consumption of sweetened beverages and health risks such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. Due to negative health effects of overconsumption of sweetened beverages, a sweetened beverage tax (soda tax) has been recommended by the Institute of Medicine in 2009. Some countries have tried to reduce sugary beverages in an effort to bring liquid caloric intake down. Mexico placed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in 2014. Drinks that were not taxed included drinks with NNSs, milk with no added sugar, and water. Other governments are active in placing policy on school lunches or what is being offered in school cafeterias in regards to beverages. Governmental activity is trying to eventually slow down the obesity epidemic.  Non-nutritive sweeteners in sugar-sweetened beverages  Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) have been introduced into the market in non-caloric drinks such as diet sodas. These artificial sweeteners are popular due to the growing demand for alternatives to SSBs. Consumption of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) with low-caloric NNSs has risen worldwide in recent years, with reports of consumption in approximately 30% of adults and 15% of children in USA between 2007 and 2008. These sweeteners are more potent than regular, natural sugars and work by promoting GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide1) secretion, which then stimulates gastric emptying and increases insulin secretion. NNSs have shown to help short-term weight loss initiatives, but they don't show significance in the long-term. Recent studies have been conducted to see whether or not NNSs pose a great risk for the development of certain diseases. Due to its ability to dissociate the sensation of sweet from caloric intake via hormonal changes, NNSs may increase appetite and promote larger food consumption and weight gain. Studies have found various negative health outcomes associated with NNSs, including weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, cardiovascular events, and bladder cancer. NNSs pose a greater risk to children especially because caloric compensation after consumption of NNSs is more complete in children who, compared to adults, lack social cues, learned behaviors, and self-control. Children compensate for NNSs consumption by increasing meal-associated calories and thus are at a higher risk of NNSs- associated weight gain. One study researched the effect of NNSs with cardiovascular disease. The research was taken using post menopausal women. Women who consumed two or more diet drinks (containing NNSs) were found to be 30% at risk for cardiovascular disease. There has been a decline in liquid calories due to the introduction of NNSs. Health implications of sugar sweetened beverages Outlook on the population's health Sugar sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are beverages that contain any form of added sugars. Out of the entire diet, Americans add sugar to beverages more so than any other product. Sugar-Sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. Other examples of added sugars, especially ones that can be listed as an ingredient, include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose, and turbinado sugar. The added sugar content is associated with several health concerns like weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, dental implications, and gout. Naturally occurring sugars, such as those in fruit or milk, are not added sugars. Even though there are several beverages/drinks that have sugar in them, some beverages, such as milk, fruit juice, and diet drinks, fall into a \\"gray\\" area because of different contributions to health and weight gain is more complex. Sugar-sweetened beverages contain added sugars such as sucrose or fructose, often in large amounts, which contribute to the overall energy density of diets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidance on free sugars. Based on the impact of free sugars intake and its effects on weight gain and dental issues the WHO has taken action on such problems. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Current evidence suggests that increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain. Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can also reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in adults. For a normal calorie diet, calories from added sugars should be less than 10 percent of the daily calorie limit. Eating habits that include a lesser amount of added sugars, that can be from reduced intake of sugary drinks, can be associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults. Sugar addiction Evidence regarding sugar addiction is mainly based on literature and research conducted on animals. There is a biomedical and neurological science behind the usage of mini-pigs and lab rodents. In these animal species, there are similarities with humans in terms of cognition, development of food preferences and eating disorders, digestive anatomy and functions, as well as brain development. Research has demonstrated that, under certain conditions, rats can develop addiction-like behaviors with respect to sugar. The food addiction model asserts that excessive consumption of palatable foods may be understood within the same neurobiological framework as drug addiction. The test subjects have similar brain anomalies as those described in humans. Drug addiction has an impact on the brain's reward center and substance abuse. In drug addiction, there is a \\"drug-seeking\\" behavior, which is similar having a \\"sweet tooth\\" and seeking to satisfy the desire for a sweet item. Reward from eating is controlled by the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. In the animal study, a fructose and glucose diet induced modifications in several brain regions involved in reward and eating behavior. The observations from the study asserts that food and drug consumption share a common neurobiology that \\"hijack\\" a neural system that primarily processes natural rewards like foods. Sugar is believed to stimulate dopamine in the central nervous system. In summary, the research provided several clinical facts and evidences on the effects of sugar consumption on the central nervous system. Human research has also been conducted on sugar (in the form of sugar- sweetened beverages) and its effects on the kidneys. Sugar consumption has been associated with the rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States. Since 1997, the nation has dramatically increased sugar consumption to nearly half a pound per person per day. Much of this increase is driven by high fructose syrup (HFCS) consumption, which now amounts to over 62 lb per person per year, largely in form of sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition to dietary sugar being associated with CKD risk factors, data from animal studies do suggest that sugar consumption may independently affect kidney disease risk. Studies have been conducted to highlight the severity of sugary sweetened beverage consumption. These studies were completed with a variety of test subjects to account for age, sex, diets, lifestyle choices, physical activity, smoking, level of education, and health status. The variety in the test subjects created a wide spectrum of results to match any individual. Also, the experiments consisted of a variety of consumption frequencies. Some studies only consumed one glass of a sugary sweetened beverage a week, while others consumed more than seven glasses of a sugary sweetened beverage a week. In a recent study, the notion of sugar addiction has been challenged. The study examined a sample of 1495 human participants to determine if foods mainly containing sugar cause \\"addiction-like\\" problems that meet clinical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for substance dependence. The researchers also investigated whether potential dependence on sugar relates to body weight and negative affectivity such as mood depression. The results revealed that the majority of participants experienced at least one symptom of food dependence for combined high-fat savoury (30%) and high-fat sweet (25%) foods while only a minority experienced such problems for low-fat/savoury (2%) and mainly sugar-containing foods (5%). Furthermore, while addictive-like symptoms for high-fat savoury and high-fat sweet foods correlated to overweight conditions, this was not found to be the case for foods mainly containing sugar. Consequently, the findings indicated that sugary foods have a minimal role to contributing to food dependence and the increased risk of weight gain. Milk vs sweetened beverage consumption Research has demonstrated when school aged children (3‚Äì7 yrs. Of age) are given the choice of choosing milk or sweetened beverages at lunch time, they tend to choose the sweetened beverages. This has major health implications for children, as nutrition is essential for proper development. Studies have shown sugar sweetened beverages displace important nutrients such as iron and calcium which result in deficiency-related conditions. For example, iron deficiency can result in nerve impulse delay. Children who do not consume the appropriate amount of calcium into their daily diets have lower calcium consumption as they get older. In contrast, as they get older, their intake of sugary beverages increases. Many children grow to have a level of intolerance to milk and another significant percentage grow to not like the taste of milk.[6] Insufficient levels of calcium throughout adolescence is a precursor for osteoporosis and even obesity in some cases. Maternal consumption of milk can influence children's consumption. A study of 9-year-old girls and calcium consumption reported those who met the average recommended intake (AI) for calcium consumed almost twice as much milk and less sweetened beverages (18%) had mothers who drank milk more frequently than those who were under the AI for calcium. Healthy schools campaign is an initiative set forth by Michelle Obama that promotes nutritional enrichment through food an education. The national initiatives under this program are cooking up change, green clean schools, school nurse leadership, and national collaborations. As a result, many of the sugary drinks/ sodas in elementary, middle, and high schools have been replaced by water and other nutritious drinks. Obesity Between 1975 and 2016, the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly tripled. According to the World Health Organization, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion of adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these, over 650 million (34%) were obese. Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5‚Äì19 were overweight or obese in 2016. The obesity rate is forecasted to rise to 42% by 2030. Every year, the United States spends an estimated $190 billion on obesity related conditions, or 21% of all United States health care costs. Obesity prevalence is due to genetic, metabolic, cultural, environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. Along with the increase in overweight and obese populations, the consumption of carbohydrates, particularly in the form of added sugars has increased. Research studies have indicated that there is a correlation between drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and gaining weight or becoming obese. Sugar- sweetened beverages do not provide the feeling of fullness like solid foods do, which may cause one to consume more of the beverage. According to the Center for Disease Control, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey found that 30.1% of American adults consume at least one sugar- sweetened beverage daily. Around the United States, sugar-sweetened beverage intake differs based on geographic regions and socio-demographic characteristics. States known for their obesity rates also had high consumption rates of sugar-sweetened beverages. For example, 47.1% of Mississippi adults consume at least one sugar-sweetened beverage a day. Their obesity rate correlates, with 35.6% of the adult population being obese in 2016. The World Health Organization has advised reducing intake of free sugars, such as monosaccharides and disaccharides that are added to beverages by manufacturers, cooks, or consumers. Studies have supported WHO's guidance as well. A 2006 clinical trial found that when over weight or obese adults replaced caloric beverages with water or noncaloric beverages for 6 months, they averaged weight losses of 2‚Äì2.5%. In addition, The Obesity Society recommends minimizing children's intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. Efforts to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity include both monetary penalties and limiting exposure to sugar-sweetened beverages. For example, numerous states, including Vermont have proposed taxing sugar- sweetened beverages or increasing the prices to reduce consumption.http://www.changelabsolutions.org/sites/default/files/SSB_Playbook_FINAL-20131004.pdf Economists estimate that increasing sugar sweetened beverage prices by 10% would reduce sugar sweetened beverage consumption by 12%. Global experts in fiscal policies concluded that a minimum of 20% increase in sugar-sweetened beverage taxes would result in proportional reduction in consumption. Other solutions target children, focusing on prohibiting sugar-sweetened beverages on school/after care property, including vending machines and lunches. Limits are also being considered on sugar-sweetened beverages in the workplace. Furthermore, beverage companies are being approached about reducing portion sizing of sugar-sweetened beverages because portion sizes have increased substantially over the past few decades. Impact on oral health Oral health has shown to be affected with regard to sugar sweetened beverage consumption. Acid erosion and dental caries have been the main health concerns to sugar sweetened beverages. Acid erosion is defined as the loss of tooth enamel caused by acid attack. When consuming carbonated sugar sweetened beverages, acid deposits on the teeth, attacking the enamel. Over a gradual period, the enamel is worn down, which can lead to dental caries. Erosion of tooth enamel begins at a pH of 5.5, and ingredients found in sugar sweetened beverages such as phosphoric acid and citric acid significantly contribute to the demineralization of the enamel. Citric acid in various sugar sweetened beverages can cause chelation. Consumption of sports and energy drinks have been linked to irreversible tooth damage. This is especially common in adolescents who consume about 30-50% of the beverages that are on the market. Studies have shown that energy drinks have caused twice as much damage on teeth than sports drinks. Citric acid, the preservative found in many sugar sweetened beverages causes stripping of the enamel. Fruit juices generally contain lower amounts of sugar than carbonated sugar sweetened beverages. The acidity levels found in fruit juices vary, with citrus based juices having the lowest pH levels. The low acidity found in fruit juices cause higher risk of cavities with enamel exposure. Frequency of sugar sweetened beverages results in dental caries, which are caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Dental caries is an infectious oral disease and is the breakdown of the teeth due to the bacteria in the mouth. It occurs when bacteria within the plaque metabolize the sugar, releasing various acids as waste compounds. As the acids are released, they form holes in the teeth which dissolve the enamel. The sugars, therefore provide a passageway for the activities of the oral bacteria, lowering salivary pH. The bacteria alone are not the sole cause of tooth decay, as it is the presence of these sugars that inhibit the production of acid. Effects on blood potassium levels Hypokalemia is a potassium deficiency. It is defined by the level of potassium in the blood; levels 3.5 and 5.0 mmoL are considered to be normal while levels below 3.5 mmol/L are defined as hypokalemia. There are many case reports on the relationship between hypokalemia and sugar sweetened beverages such as cola-based drinks. Based on reports published, patients' potassium levels decreased because of an increase in cola consumption; and as the consumption was reduced potassium levels rose back to normal levels. Oral supplements and other methods did not help raise potassium levels. And so it was concluded that extreme cola consumption can lead to hypokalemia. Symptoms caused by an increased consumption of cola that lead to hypokalemia include muscle weakness, leg cramps, and fatigue. There are three mechanisms that lead to potassium deficiency due to cola drinks. They are as follows: (1) a large intake of glucose which leads to an intracellular redistribution of potassium; (2) potassium wasting due to large masses of indigestible fructose in the gastrointestinal tract; (3) the caffeine in cola drinks lead to diuresis, an increase in the sodium-potassium pumps via cellular phosphodiesterase inhibition, increased renin levels, and also produced metabolic alkalosis which all lead to hypokalemia. The consumption of sugar sweetened beverages has increased over the years; this includes caffeinated and un-caffeinated drinks. The rise in consumption of soft drinks is due to the current convenience, availability, and accessibility of sugar sweetened beverages today. Over these years an increase in concern and action towards the accessibility of sugar sweetened beverages have been taken through policy. Government officials and doctors alike have responded to the increase in sugar sweetened beverages and its health effects. Internists have further discussed adding extreme sugar sweetened beverages consumption to the list of usual questions about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs that lead to hypokalemia. Although low potassium levels are tolerated in healthy adults, as cola consumption increases things like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes can be developed from hypokalemia. Pregnancy Dietary improvements in expecting mothers are important for the future health of the mother and child. Sugar- sweetened beverages among other beverages like coffee and alcohol are recommended to be reduced in intake. A Norwegian study, showed that pregnant woman minimized their intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol, and coffee, when educated about the negative effects these beverages can have on their unborn child. The statistics for each beverage showed that among alcohol, coffee, and sugar-sweetened beverages, sugar-sweetened beverages were still consumed more despite there being a minimized intake. The minimized intake of coffee and alcohol is due to the less harmful effects sugar- sweetened beverages have compared to coffee and alcohol. The report declares that the minimized intake may be due to alcohol and coffee being a part of socializing and therefore becomes substituted by sugar-sweetened beverages at social events.  Risk of type II diabetes  A large prospective cohort study showed an approximate doubling of the risk of Type II Diabetes in women who consumed at least one sugary drink per day when compared to women who consumed on average less than one sugary drink daily. This risk seemed to further be linked to an increase in BMI (Body Mass Index) that is associated with obesity and weight gain over the time course of follow-up in the study. It is important to note that fruit juice (containing no added sugars) did not significantly increase the risk for Type II Diabetes throughout the course of this study and these increases in risk seemed to be associated with beverages such as fruit punch, which have much more added sugar. = Type II diabetes pathogenesis = The hallmarks of type II diabetes (T2DM) pathogenesis are insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. In the earlier stages of disease development, cells throughout the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. Therefore, insulin is unable to cause cells to take up glucose (among other impairments) and glucose builds up in the blood. As a result, insulin secretion is ramped up, to try to compensate for this lack of response. For a while this may work, but eventually, the body's ability to secrete insulin from the pancreatic beta cells gets burnt out. In later stages of T2DM, patient cells are both resistant to insulin effects and the pancreas has lost its ability to produce adequate insulin in response to glucose. Type II diabetes is a progressive disease which eventually can lead to patients becoming dependent on exogenous insulin to lower their blood glucose levels. Consumption of high fructose and sucrose-containing diets have been previously associated with increased risk of T2DM through animal studies linking increased sugar consumption to decreased insulin sensitivity. However, a definitive conclusion on this association is still controversial, owing to a lack of data and trials on the direct effect of high-sugar diets in T2DM development. Current evidence suggests that the danger of high-sugar diets in increasing T2DM risk comes not from the direct effects of sugar on insulin resistance, but more so from the imbalance of energy intake-use that high- sugar diets can contribute to. In the United States The increase in consumption of sweetened beverages has been described as a worldwide health problem, but it is particularly visible in the United States, from where most popular drinks, like sodas, have originated. In the US, sweetened beverages such as most sodas are the most widely consumed type of foods containing added sugar, and they account for about a third of all consumption of added sugars (about half if counted together with fruit juice; about twice the amount that is gained from the categories of \\"desserts\\" and \\"sweets\\"). They represent about 7% of total energy intake, where they can account for up to 15% in children, and have been described as the \\"largest single food source of calories in the US diet\\". The consumption of sweetened beverages has increased in the US since the 1970s, accounting for a significant portion (perhaps as high as a half) of the rise in caloric intake among the American populace. Some more recent research suggests that the added sugar consumption in the US has started declining in the 21st century, due to a related decrease in the consumption of sweetened beverages, encouraged by the government health awareness initiative and other programs. The following drinks have been classified in the US as sweetened beverages if they contained sugar or other caloric sweeteners: fruit or fruit-flavored drinks, energy drinks, flavored water, coffees, teas, nonalcoholic wines and beers. Influence of the household and media/advertisement Household Taste preferences and eating behaviors in children are molded at a young age by factors, such as parents' habits and advertisements. One study compared what adults and children considered when choosing beverages. For the most part, adults considered whether beverages had sugar, caffeine, and additives. Some of the 7- to 10-year-old children in the study also mentioned \\"additives\\" and \\"caffeine\\", which may be unfamiliar terms to them. This showed the possibility of the parents' influence on their children's decision-making on food choice and eating behaviors. Media Although many factors contribute to eating behaviors and food choices in children, food advertising and media are also important factors to consider. Marketing and media influences include television advertising, in-school marketing, product placements, kids clubs, the internet, toys and products with brand logos, and youth-targeted promotions. Marketers heavily target children and adolescents as consumers because of the amount of their own money spent annually, their influence on household food purchases, and their future as adult consumers. It has been estimated that US adolescents spend $140 billion a year. Of that, children under 12 years spend another $25 billion and may have the potential to influence another $200 billion of spending per year. Although there are limited studies on food advertisement on actual food intake, a literature review concluded that children exposed to advertising will choose advertised food products, attempt to influence food purchases their parents buy, and request for specific brands, all at higher rates compared to children not exposed.

He is the subject of two Internet videos showing his interrogation and torture by the South Ossetian militants. He was posthumously awarded the Order of National Hero by the Georgian government in 2013.  Military service and death  Giorgi Antsukhelidze was born in 1984 in the village of Alvani in the highland Akhmeta district in northeast Georgia. He was conscripted in the Georgian Armed Forces in 2001. He then served in various units of the Georgian infantry headquartered at Senaki and then at Vaziani. Junior Sergeant Antsukhelidze took his service as an assistant gunner in the 41st Battalion of the 4th Infantry Brigade during the Russia‚ÄìGeorgia war of August 2008. He went missing in action on 9 August 2008 during the battle of Tskhinvali as the Georgian forces were advancing into the Shankhai district of Tskhinvali, and was considered as such until December 2008, when his body was identified using DNA testing among those retrieved from the South Ossetian military. He was buried at the fraternal cemetery of Georgian soldiers at Mukhatgverdi near Tbilisi. He was survived by his wife Maka Chikviladze and two children.  Allegations of torture  In January 2009 two video recordings emerged on the Internet showing soldiers in the South Ossetian uniforms torturing a captured Georgian soldier whom the relatives identified as Antsukhelidze. The video footage shows the militants, speaking in Ossetian and Georgian, interrogating the prisoner, forcing him to kneel and ordering him to kiss the earth. The captured soldier in a Georgian uniform is shown being repeatedly beaten and replying to each question: \\"I have no idea\\". One of the torturers is heard shouting in Ossetian: \\"Look, what a tough guy!\\". In April 2010, the Georgian non-governmental organization Georgian Young Lawyer's Association filed a claim to the European Court of Human Rights in favor of the Antsukhelidze family. The claim refers to facts of torture and murder by Russian and Ossetian militaries. A high-ranking South Ossetian officer, Soslan Pukhayev, claimed by the Georgian reports to have been associated with the murder of Antsukhelidze, was arrested by the Georgian police in July 2009.  Awards and memory  On 15 April 2013 President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili posthumously awarded Giorgi Antsukhelidze the Order of National Hero. Antsukhelidze had earlier been awarded the Order of Vakhtang Gorgasali, 1st Class. Antsukhelidze's name was given to a NCO school operated by the Ministry of Defense of Georgia in November 2013. He was also honored by President Giorgi Margvelashvili in his inaugural speech in November 2013.

The signatories were, for the former, Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov and, for the latter, in his capacity as President of the Council of the Balkan Entente, Ioannis Metaxas, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Greece. The agreement was the result of the realization by the Entente that Bulgaria alone could not threaten the members of the Entente acting in concert, and that the Bulgarian government desired to follow a policy of peace. There were at least two signs of this. A protocol signed at Belgrade on 17 March 1934 by the Balkan Entente was published privately in May, revealing that the members had plans to jointly occupy Bulgaria if efforts to suppress terrorist organizations operating out of her territory were not successful. The new Bulgarian government of Kimon Georgiev, coming to power on 19 May, responded to the private revelation by clamping down on the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. Then, on 24 January 1937, Bulgaria concluded a treaty of eternal friendship with Yugoslavia, which was approved by the other members of the Entente. (Initially Greece was very hostile.) In November 1936, the chiefs of staff of the four Balkan powers signed a draft military alliance, which was subsequently confirmed as an integral part of the Balkan Pact at the meeting of the Balkan Council on 15‚Äì18 February 1937. The agreement removed the arms restrictions placed on Bulgaria after World War I by the Treaty of Neuilly- sur-Seine, and allowed her to occupy the demilitarised zone bordering Greece. The demilitarised zones along the Turkish borders with Bulgaria and Greece, a result of the Treaty of Lausanne, were also abandoned. All the parties committed to a policy of non-aggression, but Bulgaria was not forced to abandon her territorial revisionism. Bulgarian re-armament Bulgaria had long protested the restrictions placed on armaments at Neuilly, but she, unlike Austria, Germany and Hungary, had a good track record of abiding by them. In the 1930s she began to evade them, buying military equipment from Germany, but being refused orders placed in Britain. The Bulgarians argued, and in this they had the support of the United States, that the League of Nations, which was designed to protect weak and disarmed states, was not powerful enough to protect Bulgaria. In November 1937, when the pace of re- armament had picked up, a British memorandum advised a \\"blind eye\\" policy towards it, and placing pressure on the Entente and France to do the same, in order to prevent Bulgaria from falling under the influence of the Italo-German axis. The British memo specified that Bulgaria was set to violate all the pertinent articles of the treaty: > The relevant articles of the treaty are #78, which prohibits fortification > of any further places in Bulgaria, #81, which prohibits the importation of > arms, munitions, and war materials of all kinds, #82, prohibiting the > manufacture and importation into Bulgaria of armoured cars, tanks and any > similar machines suitable for use in war, #86, which prohibits the > construction or acquisition of any submarine, even for commercial purposes > and #89, which prohibits the inclusion in the armed forces of Bulgaria of > any military or naval air forces. Although initially Turkey was strongly opposed to Bulgaria's accelerated re- armament in 1934‚Äîespecially on account of the weakness of the Greek army‚Äîby the time of the Salonika agreement, it was accepted as a fait accompli.

It also incorporates greenstone belts comprising mafic, ultramafic and felsic volcanics which are associated with epiclastic sediments and iron formations. The craton is overlain in the north, northwest and east by Proterozoic and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins whilst to the northwest are the rocks of the Magondi Supergroup. Northwards is the Zambezi Belt and to the east the Mozambique Belt. South of the Zimbabwe Craton is the Kaapvaal Craton separated from it by the Limpopo Mobile Belt, a zone of deformation and metamorphism reflecting geological events from Archean to Mesoproterozoic times. The Zimbabwe Craton is intruded by an elongate ultramafic/mafic igneous complex known as the Great Dyke which runs for more than 500 km along a SSW/NNE oriented graben. It consists of peridotites, pyroxenites, norites and bands of chromitite.  Stratigraphy   Precambrian  The oldest supracrustal rocks are the Sebakwian Group (3.5 Ga) exposed around Shurugwi and Mashava, and northwest of Gweru, within the central craton. This group consist of metavolcanic rocks, including komatiite and basalt, banded iron formation, and clastic metasedimentary rocks. The Sebakwian Group is succeeded by the Bulawayan Group, further differentiated by the Lower Greenstones (2.9 Ga) and Upper Greenstones (2.7 Ga). The Lower Greenstones include felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, komatiites, and komatiitic basalts with interbedded iron-formations and polymict clastic sediments. Overlying the Bulawayan Group is the Shamvaian Group (2.7 Ga), and it is these two groups which constitute the main greenstone belts. The tonalitic Sesombi Suite and granitic Chilimanzi Suite granitoids intruded the Upper Greenstones and Shamvaian Group between 2.7 Ga to 2.6 Ga. The last major Archaen event was the intrusion of the Great Dyke (2.5 Ga). By 1982, 123 mines had produced 155 tonnes of gold from the stratabound iron-formations of the Sebakwian, and Lower and Upper Greenstones. Of these mines, 31 had produced more than 311 kg, with the Wanderer Mine near Shurugwi producing the most at 36 tonnes. Non- stratabound gold production included 128 tonnes from the Que Que Ultramafic Complex within the Mashaba Ultramafic Suite of the Upper Greenstones, while the Upper Greenstone Basaltic and Bimodal Units had produced 400 and 161 tonnes respectively. Granitoid host rocks had produced a total of 132 tonnes of gold, and include the Rhodesdale Batholith at 53 tonnes, the Sesombi Suite at 36 tonnes, and the Penhalonga quartz diorite at 10 tonnes.  Economic geology  Zimbabwe's mineral resources include, amongst others, coal, chromium ore, nickel, copper, iron ore, vanadium, tin, platinum group metals (such as palladium) and diamonds. Globally it is a significant producer of lithium, chrysotile asbestos and vermiculite. Gold, platinum group metals and chromium are Zimbabwe's key mineral resources. The Great Dyke provides most of Zimbabwe's chromium reserves. Zimbabwe experienced a decline in the mining of many minerals in the period to 2008 including the closure of several gold mines. However, diamond production increased making the country Africa's seventh largest producer by 2008. The country has considerable coal reserves which are used in power generation.

He is best known for his role in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, the landmark US Supreme Court case that challenged the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) policy of excluding homosexuals from being scout leaders. Before the case James Dale joined the Scouting program at the age of 8 years old, beginning with Pack 242 in Monmouth County, New Jersey. Over the years Dale engaged with a number of different troops and rose through the various levels of Scouting. In Troop 128, he became a prot√©g√© of M. Norman Powell, a descendant of Lord Baden- Powell (founder of the international Scouting movement). It was Powell who presented Dale with his Eagle Scout Award in the fall of 1988. While a student at Rutgers University, Dale became co-president of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Alliance. In July 1990, he was a featured speaker at a Rutgers School of Social Work conference on the health needs of lesbian and gay teenagers and was interviewed by the Newark Star Ledger. In the interview, Dale was quoted as stating that he was gay. After the interview appeared, BSA officials expelled Dale, then 19 years old, from his position as assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 73. \\"The grounds for this membership revocation are the standards for leadership established by the Boy Scouts of America, which specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.\\" Dale filed suit in the New Jersey Superior Court, alleging that the Boy Scouts had violated the state statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. In 1995 Superior Court Judge Patrick J. McGann ruled with the BSA labeling Dale an \\"active sodomite.\\" In 1998 the Superior Court decision was overturned on appeal. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court of New Jersey sided with Dale, asserting that his expulsion from the BSA violated the law. The Boy Scouts appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari. BSA v. Dale Boy Scouts of America et al v. Dale was heard by the Supreme Court on April 26, 2000, and the decision was announced on June 28. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Court sided with the BSA and overturned the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision. The majority opinion held that the First Amendment right to freedom of \\"expressive association\\" allows a private organization like the BSA to exclude members who they feel would express a viewpoint that is contrary to the organization's mission. The Scout Oath and Scout Law set forth central tenets, including that a Scout must be \\"clean\\" and \\"morally straight\\". The BSA maintained that homosexuality was unclean and immoral, and therefore the presence of an openly gay scout would be contrary to the group's cause. In their dissenting opinion, the minority held that the ban on gay Scouts did not follow from its founding principles, and Scout Law says nothing on matters of sexuality. They noted that Scout policy discourages Scoutmasters to engage in any discussion of sexual issues, so it should make no difference what that Scoutmaster's sexual orientation might be, and society's longstanding history of prejudice against gays and lesbians would be aggravated by the \\"creation of a constitutional shield\\". Post decision In 2012, the BSA reaffirmed their ban on gays from membership in the organization. Dale continues to maintain that the BSA policy on gays is a question of civil rights on which there can be no compromise: \\"In order for scouting to regain its relevancy and be on the right side of history, there can be no halfway\\". On May 23, 2013, the BSA's National Council approved a resolution to remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation alone effective January 1, 2014. The ban on gay adult scout leaders remained in effect. On May 21, 2015, BSA National President Robert Gates stated that the \\"status quo [ban on gay adult leaders] in [the BSA] movement's membership standards cannot be sustained\\" and that he would no longer seek to revoke the charters of chapters that accept gay adult leaders.

Chart showing the number of sterilisations reported to the central authority, the National Swedish Board of Health or the National Board of Health and Welfare, between 1935 and 1979 and the various indications for operations performed between 1941 and 1975. In order to keep a lid on sterilisations, eugenicists arranged to collect detailed information. As a consequence, Swedish data is complete when it comes to legal operations since 1941. An unknown number of men were sterilised abroad or illegally in Sweden. This may have been the cause of the lower number of operations during the early 1970s. When, from January 1976, permission was no longer needed, the number of sterilisations grew considerably. Compulsory sterilisation in Sweden were sterilisations which were carried out in Sweden, without a valid consent of the subject, during the years 1906‚Äì1975 on eugenic, medical and social grounds. Between 1972 and 2012, sterilisation was also a condition for gender reassignment surgery.  Legal grounds  The general rule between 1941 and 1976 was that sterilisation was illegal, but there were three grounds on which sterilisation could be permitted:SOU 1974:25 Fri sterilisering, \\"The current Sterilization Law (1941: 282) is restrictive. License is required for sterilization and permission is granted only if certain restricted conditions of an eugenic, social or medical nature are fulfilled.\\" * Medical, if a pregnancy could seriously put a woman suffering from chronic illness or permanently weakened constitution at risk of life and health. * Eugenic, which allowed sterilising people considered insane or with severe illness or with a physical disability. * Social indication allowed sterilisation of people considered unsuitable to foster a child due to mental illness, being feebleminded or having an antisocial lifestyle. It was never legal to physically restrain a person. From 1944, the number of eugenic sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased. Statistics The number of eugenic sterilisations peaked in the 1940s; from 1946, the number of sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased.Kurbegovic, L. (n.d.). Sweden. Retrieved February 28, 2020, from https://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/world/51c2742697b8940a54000009 In 1997, on behalf of the Swedish government, the ethnologists Mikael Eiverg√•rd and Lars- Eric J√∂nsson made an attempt at estimating what percentage of sterilisations were coerced. They found that a quarter of the applications were made under circumstances similar to coercion such as a condition for release from an institution and that another 9 percent were signed under pressure. In half of the cases they found no sign of coercion or pressure, but signs of the applicants' own initiative. Tyd√©n uses these percentages to make an estimate of the number of operations under coercion. He found that 15,000 were made as a condition for release and that another 5500 to 6000 were made under other kinds of pressure, whereas 30,000 were voluntary and on the applicants' own initiative. From the 2000s, the Swedish state paid out damages to victims who filed for compensation.  Sterilisation during sex change  Until 2012, sterilisation was mandatory before sex change.Sweden keeps sex-change sterilisation law, The Local, January 12, 2012 This last mandatory sterilisation has been criticised by several political parties in Sweden and since 2011 the Parliament of Sweden was expected to change the law but ran into opposition from the Christian Democrat party. After efforts to overturn the law failed in parliament, the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal overturned the law on 19 December 2012, declaring it unconstitutional after the law was challenged by an unidentified plaintiff.

Early career  Ralph Brown was born in Leeds, and is the younger contemporary of the eminent group of Yorkshire sculptors that include Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore and Kenneth Armitage. Between 1948 and 1951 he studied at Leeds College of Art, where both Moore and Hepworth attended. He then spent a year at Hammersmith School of Art before entering the Royal College of Art in 1952 where he was taught by Frank Dobson, John Skeaping and Leon Underwood. He won a number of scholarships including a trip to Paris to work in the studio of Ossip Zadkine where he also saw work by Auguste Rodin and Germain Richier and met Giacometti. In 1957 he won the Boise Scholarship to Italy where he was inspired by the work of Marino Marini and Giacomo Manzu. Brown also worked in Cannes making mosaics for Pablo Picasso  Style and Technique  Like Henry Moore who befriended him and encouraged him by buying his work, Brown's art is deeply rooted in the figurative tradition. However, whilst his predecessors focused their energies on carving and maintaining 'truth to materials', Brown concentrated on modelling allowing him to interact with his material on a more intimate level. In the introductory catalogue essay for Brown's major retrospective show at Leeds City Art Gallery in 1988 Dennis Farr commented: \\"So much of Brown's sculpture is his search for equivalents, in formal terms, for sensual experiences.\\"  Harlow New Town Commission  Brown came to national prominence in the late 1950s with his large-scale bronze group Meat Porters, commissioned for Harlow New Town, Essex. The piece is a tribute to physical labour with two figures hauling an ox carcass, a subject fitting to the busy market square and a form that brings dynamism to the otherwise rigid architecture. The concrete version of the piece won second prize for sculpture at the John Moore's Exhibition, Liverpool in 1959.  Recognition  During the 1950s Brown's work attracted much critical acclaim and was shown alongside his contemporaries Kenneth Armitage, William Turnbull and Eduardo Paolozzi. Brown was elected a Royal Academician in 1972 and his work can be found in many prestigious public collections including the Tate Collection, Arts Council of Great Britain, Leeds City Art Gallery and many other public collections in Britain and overseas. Brown had a major retrospective at Leeds City Art Gallery in 1988. Ralph Brown is represented by Pangolin London.

NEELANSHU AGARWAL ‚Äì Wildviolet : USAINTERVIEW ‚Äî Dr. S. C. Dwivedi Literary Mahendra Bhatnagar is one of the many Indian poets whose literary careers were shaped by poetry in the post-independence of India in the 20th century. His poetic career over the years demonstrates his humanistic vision from beginning to end. Rooted deep into the Indian soil, his poems reflect not only the moods of a poet but of a complex age. In his works, the thread of his humanistic vision can be seen vividly and he wrote poems to bring about a change in the world. He analyses, interprets, evaluates and describes his emotions in the light of his humanistic vision. For example, his poem \\"Helplessness\\" reveals not only his own helplessness, but also of the common people of India: > \\"Thrust upon, undesired life, I lived. > Every instant, every step, shame I lived > History, now you ask me what > Folly and dirtiness of the world, I lived.\\"Mahendra Bhatnagar's Biography He also uses irony to expose the fraud of exploiters, particularly exposing the enemies of the labourers and the peasants of India.

Casimir moved to Port-au-Prince in the late 1940s and is here presented to the Centre d'Art in 1947 by his friend, the painter Dieudonn√© Cedor. From 1950 to 1956 he attended the Foyer of Fine Arts, founded by a group of intellectuals and modern artists, including Cedor. Casimir was one of the originators of a Haitian archetype market painting, he painted using various shades of red, orange and yellow. His style has been often imitated, it is difficult to confirm the authenticity of the paintings that bear his name. In the mid-1970s he lived in Martissant where he would be selling his paintings from the front room, while in the back yard, a few of his apprentices would be painting and filling in the colours and the Casimir's canvases, all would later be signed by him.

The company is majority owned by Nestl√©, and minority owned by the Hsu family. History Beginnings and independent growth In 1992, Mekey Hsu Chen founded Hsu Fu Chi in The People's Republic of China. In 1994, the brand was trademarked in the PRC. In 1997, Transpac invested in the company, and the brand became the top-selling brand in China for ten years; in 2008, they were relegated to the number 2 position, after Mars, Inc. Hsu Fu Chi was the first company to introduce the \\"Pick and Mix\\" format in China, in which consumers can pick various kinds of confectionaries out of tubs of various confectionaries; and instead of picking only one kind, one can pick as many as they wish. In 2000, Hsu Fu Chi began to build a distribution network across China. In 2004, they created the world's first fully automated sachima plant. They were listed on a stock exchange in Singapore in 2006: the SGX ST in 2006, one of the first Chinese confectionery companies to be listed on a stock exchange, and the first to be listed on the SGX. They opened their newest factory, one in Zhumadian, China; in 2010. Over five years, from 2007 to 2012, their profits grew 17%.  Acquisition by Nestl√© In 2011, the company entered talks with several undisclosed companies for the sale of the company. On 11 July 2011, Nestl√©, the largest food company in the world, paid $1.7 billion for a 60 percent stake in Hsu Fu Chi International, which is about 3.3 times the sales figures of Hsu Fu Chi for the stake. Nestl√© agreed to buy 43.5 percent of Hsu Fu Chi's shares at S$4.35. If the scheme was approved by independent shareholders, Nestl√© would then acquire a 16.5 percent stake from the Hsu family, which would leave them with 40 percent. On 6 December 2011, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the government of The Cayman Islands (where the company was incorporated) accepted Nestl√©'s bid, and allowed Nestl√© to proceed in its acquisition. Currently, Nestl√© owns 60% of the company, and the Hsu family currently owns 40%.

She had a considerable number of literary and social acquaintances including Augusta Leigh and Lady Cork. During her own lifetime she was sometimes confused with Emma Roberts, with whom she corresponded, though the two women were not related. They were about the same age and they were both referred to as Miss Roberts. Unusually for single women of that era they had also both travelled separately to Calcutta within two or three years of each other.Two Years at Sea (1834) Early life Jane Roberts was born in Hythe, Kent, in 1792, the only surviving daughter of John and Martha Roberts (formerly Martha Bedson). Her father was paymaster of 10th Dragoons and later barrack master at Dungeness Fort in Kent, where he died in 1816. Her mother died at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea in 1823, and was buried at Mortlake in Surrey, where Jane erected a tombstone to her memory. Two of Jane's brothers emigrated to Australia, one of whom was Peter Roberts (1786-1860), Deputy Assistant Commissary General in New South Wales.The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 15 July 1824 Jane intended to join her brothers in 1829, but for family reasons she immediately returned to England where she wrote an account of her voyage.Jane Roberts - Diary and Notebook 1833-1839 and 1851, two volumes Career Jane Roberts' first book, \\"Two Years at Sea\\" was published by Richard Bentley in 1834 and dedicated to the Earl of Munster, a connection that stemmed from her father's links with the 10th Dragoons. Her first novel, \\"Lowenstein, King of the Forests\\" was published in 1836 by Whittaker & Co, but after this initial burst of activity she gradually faded from the literary mainstream. Her journal records that she maintained extensive connections with literary-minded people, amongst whom were Lady Bradford and Lady Dungannon. Lodging in London, she was able to support herself partly through her writing but probably far more by the patronage of Lady Cork, and by means of a pension that was administered by her brother John Roberts (1790-1868), First Clerk and Head of the Promotions Department of the War Office.House of Commons Reports from Committees January‚ÄìAugust 1860, Volume VIII The last entry in her journal is dated 1851, and in 1861 she was lodging in the Marylebone Road in London, but her date and place of death is uncertain. Jane Roberts also wrote a quantity of poetry, some of which was published anonymously, and a number of unpublished poems and draft plots for novels survive in her notebooks. She was the inventor of The Royal Historical Game of Cards, mentioned in her journal and published by Robert Hardwicke in 1835.

It is native to shallow waters around New Zealand. Description Pyura pachydermatina has a club-shaped body supported by a long stalk, both being covered by a tough exterior tunic. In colour it is off- white or a garish shade of reddish-purple. The stalk is two thirds to three quarters the length of the whole animal which helps distinguish it from certain invasive tunicates not native to New Zealand such as Styela clava and Pyura stolonifera. It is one of the largest species of tunicates and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length. Distribution and habitat Pyura pachydermatina is found attached to rocks in shallow, wave-swept areas of the seas around New Zealand. It is a filter feeder. It is usually found subtidally and prefers cooler waters than does Pyura stolonifera. Biology Pyura pachydermatina has a lifespan of about one year. It breeds in the winter after which the adult generation die. The planktonic larvae settle on the seabed in late winter and early spring. It co-exists with a parasitic ribbon worm, Gononemertes australiensis which lives in its digestive gland or body cavity. This has a similar annual life cycle, the peak of which is synchronised with that of its host. The ribbon worm larvae invade their hosts when they are juveniles soon after settlement and become precociously mature within three weeks. This means that the maximum number of ribbon worm larvae are available to invade the hosts when they are newly settled. Almost all the tunicates contain at least one worm. Research Cells lining the gut of Pyura pachydermatina have been found to contain an insulin-like material in two forms that are immunologically active. The tissues of this tunicate are strengthened by the presence of two types of spicules. In the blood vessels in the tunic there are dogbone-shaped spicules and in the vessels in the body wall there are antler-shaped spicules. These spicules have a core of amorphous calcium carbonate enveloped in an insoluble layer of organic material with a thick exterior covering of calcite. This is in contrast to the spicules of a sponge such as Clathrina which has a calcite core, a thick layer of amorphous calcium carbonate and a thin outer covering of calcite.

Born to a noble Javanese family in Blora, Central Java, Tirto first studied to become a doctor but later focused on journalism. A freelancer since 1894, in 1902 he was made an editor of the Batavia- (now Jakarta-) based Pembrita Betawi. Tirto established his first newspaper in 1903 and, four years later, created Medan Prijaji as a medium for educated native Indonesians. This proved his longest-lived publication, lasting over five years before Tirto was exiled in 1912 to Bacan for his staunch anti-colonial criticism. Medan Prijaji is recognised as the first truly \\"Indonesian\\" newspaper, and Tirto has been called the father of Indonesian journalism. He was made a National Hero of Indonesia in 2006. The main character in Pramoedya Ananta Toer's Buru Quartet is based on him. Early life Tirto was born to a priyayi (noble Javanese) family in Blora, Central Java, sometime between 1872 and 1880. He was raised by his grandparents, who had a stressed relationship with the ruling Dutch colonists after Tirto's grandfather Tirtonoto had been deposed as regent by a Dutch- backed man. Despite this, Tirto was able to attend schools for European youth () in Bojonegoro, Rembang, and Madiun. He graduated in 1894; that year he began to dabble in journalism, doing some correspondence for the Malay- language daily Hindia Olanda; he did not receive an honorarium, but was given free newspapers when his works were published. Tirto continued his studies to the capital at Batavia (now Jakarta), where he chose to study at the School for Training Native Physicians (STOVIA). The choice was unusual for students of noble descent, who usually went to the school for future government employees. STOVIA. Tirto spent six years at STOVIA, taking three years of preparatory courses and another three of studies. In his fourth year he left the school, either after dropping out or being expelled. Tirto wrote that he had failed an exam necessary to graduate as he had been too busy writing for Hindia Olanda to study, thus necessitating his withdrawal from the school. Meanwhile, Pramoedya Ananta Toer in his biography of Tirto writes that Tirto was caught giving a prescription to his Chinese wife, while he was not yet qualified to do so, leading to Tirto's expulsion. Early journalism Upon leaving STOVIA in 1900 Tirto remained involved in journalism. He began working as an editor of the Batavia-based daily Pembrita Betawi in 1902, working concurrently as an assistant editor for Warna Sari and correspondent for the Surakarta-based Bromartani. His column Dreyfusiana (a reference to the then- ongoing Dreyfus affair in France) contained heated criticism of the Dutch colonial government and the misuse of power. These themes remained common even after Tirto left the newspaper in 1903. Tirto established his own newspaper, Soenda Berita, later that year; it was targeted mainly at native readers, but also catered to ethnic Chinese and Indos to attract advertising revenue. Malaysian historian Ahmat Adam calls Soenda Berita the first native-owned newspaper in the Indies. The publication was not, however, long lasting; following a breach of trust case in which he was accused of stealing an accessory, Tirto was exiled to Bacan in 1904. He soon befriended the sultan, Muhammad Sidik Syah, and on 8 February 1906 Tirto married the sultan's daughter, Raja Fatimah. Medan Prijaji, SDI and death Front page of Medan Prijaji, 2 April 1910 After returning to Java in 1906 Tirto began plans for a new Malay-language newspaper, working with various priyayi and merchants. They first united as the Sarekat Priyayi in 1906, and the following year Tirto launched Medan Prijaji, a weekly based in Bandung. He advertised the new newspaper as \\"a voice for the kings, native nobles, and thoughts of native traders.\\" Though the organization, Sarekat Prijaji, failed, the newspaper was going strong and gaining fame across the whole Dutch-Indies. The newspaper has been widely recognised as the first truly \\"Indonesian\\" newspaper, although the medium had been present in the area since Bataviase Nouvelles was established in 1744, as it was owned and operated by native Indonesians, including native reporters, editors, and printers; the target audience was likewise native. Tirto continued to criticise Dutch policies, becoming increasingly explicit; one case in 1909 led to him being imprisoned for two months. During this period he established two smaller publications, Soeloeh Keadilan and the woman-oriented Poetri Hindia. Samanhudi, one of the founders of SDI. Mas Marco Kartodikromo. In 1910 Tirto moved Medan Prijaji to Batavia and made it a daily. The first edition in this new format was published on 5 October 1910; by this time it had around 2,000 subscribers. He continued to write staunch criticisms of the Dutch colonial government and advertised the newspaper as an \\"organ for the subjugated people in the Dutch Easties\\" and \\"a place for the native voices\\" . Before he made the newspaper daily, he was briefly exiled to Lampung for an article he wrote in Medan Prijaji. During this era, Tirto also founded, according to his letters, along with Samanhudi later on, Sarekat Dagang Islam (which later, under Tjokroaminoto, turned into SI or Sarekat Islam). Tirto used his house as an early headquarters for SDI and eventually became the organization's Secretary-advisor. He went on several trips across Java to promote the organization and in Solo he met Samanhudi and talked further about the organization. As time goes, he became more and more vocal about the importance of organization and boycott as a weapon for the weak against the oppressor (in this case the Dutch). Criticism of the government and promotion of a nationalist ideology at the time was dangerous, and numerous writers had spent time in prison for expressing their disdain for colonialism. Tirto and Medan Prijaji were able to last until 1912, when the Dutch closed the paper; the last issue was printed on 3 January 1912, and Tirto was sent back to Bacan. One of the reasons he was sent to exile, was his article regarding Rembang's regent, in which he criticized the regent of being weak and manipulative and ultimately blaming him for Kartini's death. The fact that the governor general at the time, Idenburg, was at Rembang, mourning for the regent's death, probably made it worse for Tirto. Tirto was also falsely accused by the Dutch of having a big debt to the national bank at the time. After his newspaper was shut down by the Dutch, his name and reputation was damaged and never recovered until his untimely death. Tirto died in 1918, in the hotel he formerly owned, Hotel Medan Prijaji, which by then was already auctioned by Goenawan, Tirto's old friend. The irony is not a single newspaper, at the time, wrote about his death. Only Marco Kartodikromo, one of his employee at Medan Prijaji, whom later became a writer himself, wrote a little obituary about his mentor's death. Tirto was initially buried at Mangga Dua, but then, in 1973, his grave moved because the land was bought by a developer to build a mall there. Now, he is buried along with his family's and descendant's graveyard in Bogor. Legacy Pramoedya Ananta Toer, author of Buru Tetralogy and The Initiator. Syafik Umar, a senior reporter at the Bandung-based daily Pikiran Rakyat, writes that Medan Prijaji laid the framework for modern journalism in Indonesia. He cites the work's layout and nationalistic creed, which was different from the earlier Dutch- and Indo- owned works. Journalist Sudarjo Tjokosisworo described Tirto as the first Indonesian journalist to use the media to shape public opinion. Educator Ki Hajar Dewantara praised Tirto's sharp insights. Others have considered Tirto's work in the media, together with that of Dewantara and Agus Salim, as forging a national identity, a necessary precursor to independence. For his writings, Tirto was declared a Press Hero in 1973. He was made a National Hero of Indonesia on 3 November 2006 for \\"outstanding contributions to the nation\\". In his history of Indonesia, Merle Calvin Ricklefs describes Tirto as the \\"father of Indonesian journalism\\". Minke, the main character of Pramoedya Ananta Toer's Buru Quartet, was based on Tirto. As with Tirto, Minke was born in Blora and wrote extensive polemics against the Dutch. Minke likewise established a newspaper named Medan Priyayi and used it as a vehicle for his political views before ultimately being sent into exile. Apart from the tetralogy, Pramoedya also wrote a non-fictional book about Tirto Adhi Soerjo's rise and fall titled 'The Initiator' or 'Sang Pemula' in Indonesian. An Indonesian news website, Tirto.id, is named in honor of Tirto.

Career Halle hails from Molde and was a promising goalkeeper in his youth. He played 50 matches for Molde FK's first team between 1962 and 1964. He landed on his head during a match against Skarb√∏vik, and was in hospital for two days. This injury ended his career in Molde FK, but he continued his career as a goalkeeper in lower leagues for Tr√¶ff and Rival. Halle started refereeing after his career as player in Molde FK ended, and continued to represent Molde FK as a referee. Halle became a national referee in 1970, and officiated 187 matches in Tippeligaen between 1973 and 1993. He was a part of Molde FK's board, but was told in 1975 that he had to resign from his position by the Norwegian FA. Halle officiated the Norwegian Football Cup final in 1980 between V√•lerenga and Lillestr√∏m, and the final between Fredrikstad and Viking in 1984 and was one of the first referees to have officiated two Norwegian Cup finals.

In a match between Austria Wien and Werder Bremen, Halle blew his whistle for half time even though the match had only elapsed for 40 minutes, because he forgot that the match was postponed for five minutes. He realized his mistake before the players entered the changing rooms, and the teams resumed playing. After this incident, Halle was called \\"Halbzeit Halle\\" (half-time Halle) by his referee-colleagues. Halle has admitted that clubs tried to bribe him and his colleagues ahead of European matches during the 1980s, but insisted that neither he, nor any of the Norwegian referees that he travelled with, ever accepted the bribes. In 1995, Halle became a referee-observer for UEFA, and his first match as an observer was the match between Juventus and Manchester United.

It produces and sells mineral water, and carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, in Italy and worldwide. San Benedetto is a leading company in the non-alcoholic beverage sector in Italy, with six production sites in Italy (Scorz√®, Popoli, Donato, Nepi, Viggianello, Atella), two in Spain, one in Poland and one in Hungary. In 2018, it employs a staff of 1,953 worldwide and has 44 bottling lines in Italy, and a production capacity of 4.49 billion bottles a year. It is controlled by the Zoppas family of industrialists through the holding company Finanziaria S. Benedetto S.p.A. History The origins The first plant for bottling mineral water from the San Benedetto and Guizza springs in Scorz√® dates back to 1956, and was founded by the brothers Bruno and Ermenegildo (known as Ilo) Scattolin, who owned a food shop and the land on which the spring is found. The company takes its name from the spring of the same name, which has been renowned as a source of health since the times of the Venetian Republic. In 1959 the company became a joint-stock company, with the Scattolin family retaining majority holding, while bringing in distant relatives with a 33% interest: the Zoppas family, who in those years were developing their household appliances company of the same name. Augusto Zoppas became president of the company, of which majority holding remained with the Scattolin family. In 1971, when the household appliance company was in the throes of a crisis and its founder Luigi had passed away for a year, the Zoppas family acquired the majority interest of San Benedetto, which had some financial issues. Enrico Zoppas was appointed Managing Director and Giuliano De Polo, the son-in-law of Augusto Zoppas, became President. Enrico Zoppas took up also the presidency in 2004, after Mr De Polo's passing.  Growth  In 1984 the company signed an agreement with Cadbury Schweppes International, and began to produce and distribute the entire range of Schweppes products in Italy. In 1988 a franchising agreement was signed with PepsiCo to produce and market the range of the 'Pepsi' and 'Seven Up' brands in Italy. In 1995 a new plant was opened in Popoli (Pescara province), where the Guizza Fonte Valle Reale mineral water is bottled. The company then launched the sport drink Energade on the market. In early 2000, through an agreement of equal cooperation between San Benedetto and Danone, the company Polska Woda was established in Poland and Magyarviz Kft. in Hungary. In 2002 an agreement was signed for the production and packaging of Coca-Cola products for the European market. In 2006 Enrico, Gianfranco, Renzo, Maria Teresa, Sara, Federico and Matteo Zoppas reached an agreement to purchase the shares of the other members of the Zoppas family, so as to hold 100% of the holding Finanziaria San Benedetto at the head of the San Benedetto Mineral Water Group. In 2010 San Benedetto acquired from Danone the remaining 50% of the two companies that produced and sold mineral water and soft drinks in Poland and Hungary, becoming the sole shareholder. In 2014 San Benedetto built a new plant in Viggianello (Potenza province) to bottle San Benedetto mineral water from the Pollino National Park.

Biography A relative (possibly a nephew) of Leo V the Armenian, Gregory had served as a strategos (general and military governor of a theme) under Leo, but neither of the main sources (Genesios, Theophanes Continuatus, Skylitzes) mention any details.. The historian Gustave Schlumberger identified him with a strategos of Macedonia known through a contemporary seal,. while Warren Treadgold theorized that Gregory may have served as Count of the Opsician Theme, which was the Asian theme closest to Constantinople and hence of particular importance for the stability of the regime.. On Christmas Day 820, Leo was murdered by the supporters of his long-time friend, Michael the Amorian, who succeeded him on the throne.. When presented to the new emperor to swear his allegiance, a few days later, Gregory was overcome with emotion and began abusing Michael for his supporters' acts, implying his own involvement. Michael initially appeared conciliatory, and even said that he understood Gregory's feelings, but two days later, he had him arrested and exiled to the island of Skyros in the central Aegean Sea.. He was soon released by the supporters of Thomas the Slav, who had risen up in revolt against Michael and rallied most of the themes of Asia Minor to his side. Gregory readily joined Thomas's revolt, and was entrusted with the command of over 10,000 troops.. Gregory commanded Thomas's fleet in the assaults on Constantinople, attempting without success to scale the seaward walls of the city along the Golden Horn: in the first assault, in December 821, the fleet was hindered by the weather from playing any part in the attack, but in the second assault in spring 822, his fleet was decisively defeated by the imperial fleet loyal to Michael.. This setback demoralized Thomas's supporters, and was especially damaging for Gregory as the main naval commander. In addition, Michael held his wife and children hostage in Constantinople, so that Gregory took up contact with the emperor and resolved to desert Thomas along with a small group of loyal followers. He departed the rebel camp and headed west, sending a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops, and killed him..

In addition to these units, the 20th Commando Regiment was under the command of the division. It which was primarily used in the anti-tank role. The first clash between Syrian forces and the Israeli army forces occurred near the town of Jezzine, in the southern part of the valley. To protect the town against the advancing Israeli forces, infantry units and elements of the 76th Armoured Brigade were dispatched. In the ensuing battle, the IDF managed to defeat the Syrian forces and occupy the town. A few days later, the division again fought forces of the IDF, who attacked the division on 11 June 1982, in the Battle of Sultan Yacoub. During this battle, the 91st and 76th Brigades were in the line while the 58th remained in reserve. At the same time forces of the 3rd Armoured Division began moving south along the Bekaa Valley to help against the Israeli attack. Finally, after heavy fighting, the division successfully staved off the Israeli troops and continued to hold the eastern part of the Beirut - Damascus line. Despite the losses the Syrians suffered, this battle is considered a great success because the Israeli effort was curbed.  21st century  The division was subordinate to the Second Corps, whose headquarters are in Al- Zabadani, north-west of Damascus, on the border of Lebanon. The corps has responsibility for the entire area north of Damascus to Homs including Lebanon. Corps forces were set up in Lebanon during the Syrian presence there, which lasted from 1976 to 2005. The 1st Division itself is currently headquartered at the Al-Kiswah base, south of Damascus. In 2001, according to Richard Bennett, the division was composed of three brigades, the 44th Armoured, 46th Armoured, and the 42nd Mechanized. According to Holliday, by the beginning of 2012, the division consisted of the 76th, 91st, and 153rd Armoured Brigades, the 58th Mechanized Brigade, and an artillery regiment.Holliday 2013, 48.

It was recorded in the year before Dinger's death on Good Friday 2008 and is the only one of three albums made since 1998 to have been released. It was originally intended to be released as a La D√ºsseldorf album, but this was blocked at the last minute by Hans Lampe, the band's original drummer. Background and recording In July 1998 Dinger disbanded La! Neu? after a final concert in D√ºsseldorf. After the concert he was approached by a Japanese artist named Masaki Nakao, who had moved to D√ºsseldorf from Japan in 1989. Over the next ten years Nakao and Dinger became close friends, and in 1999 Nakao introduced Dinger to a group of Japanese musicians living in D√ºsseldorf. Dinger organised a \\"festival\\" at his Zeeland studios for midsummer 1999, to which many of these Japanese musicians were invited (as well as a selection of Dinger's collaborators from 1966 onwards). Dinger was later to say that \\"Nakao opened the door to Japandorf\\". Dinger's first acquaintance was Kazuyuki Onouchi, who had studied traditional Japanese painting at Tama Art University. Onouchi was advised by his lecturer Noi Sawaragi to come to D√ºsseldorf if he wanted to pursue a career in music, which he subsequently did. Kazu's friend Miki Yui was also present at the Zeeland Festival. She was born in Tokyo, having moved to D√ºsseldorf in 1994 to pursue a career in installation art, particularly involving ambient sound recordings. Dinger, Nakao, Yui and Onouchi worked together with Victoria Wehrmeister, Andreas Reihse (both of La! Neu?), Maki Umehara and Thea Djordjadze the following year on an album named as \\"Pre- Japandorf\\" and as yet unreleased. Recorded in tandem with this was a second album named \\"Viva Remix\\" (a remix of the La D√ºsseldorf album) to which Dinger, Yui, Nakao and Onouchi contributed along with Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer and Renate Dinger. Some time after the year 2000, Dinger and Miki Yui were married. In 2001 Satoshi Okamoto - a keyboard player from Kobe who had previously worked with J-Pop acts - came to Zeeland to join sessions for Viva Remix. In the same year, Kazu helped Klaus to master the final La! Neu? album \\"Live at Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf\\". Viva Remix was completed in 2003 and presented to various record labels without avail. The group returned to the studio to improve the album, but Dinger found it difficult to finance these sessions, having to sell much of his studio equipment. In the meantime, Onouchi and Okamoto began working together independently of the rest of the group, forming themselves into a band they named \\"sub-tle.\\" [hyphen and full-stop part of band name.] In the summer of 2007 the band travelled to Zeeland to work on a third album named \\"Japandorf\\". \\"Immermannstra√üe\\", \\"Udon\\" and \\"Spacemelo\\" (all songs which had developed over the previous eight years) were fully recorded during this period. Sessions continued in the spring of 2008, in which time \\"Cha Cha 2008\\", \\"Sketch No. 4\\", \\"Sketch No. 1_b\\" and finally \\"Karnival\\" were recorded. On 21 March 2008 (Good Friday) Dinger died in his sleep after a sudden heart attack, having almost completed the album. His will left his estate to Miki Yui, and she set about completing the album, writing and recording her vocals to \\"Spacemelo\\" amongst other things. In late 2008 Onouchi and Okamoto released their debut album as sub-tle. - \\"pre_mary\\" - on the D√ºsseldorf \\"Onpa)))))\\" label. Over the next three years Kazu and Miki mastered all three of the albums recorded since 1998, and Miki began to digitalise Dinger's video archive (also creating a new website: http://www.klausdinger.com/). In 2010 she collaborated with Michael Rother in the re-release of Neu! 4 and the Neu! Vinyl Box. In 2012, a photo-book covering Dinger's life was published by Slowboy, , and an associated exhibition held in D√ºsseldorf. On 25 March 2013 Japandorf was released by Gr√∂nland Records. Initial press shots of the album artwork show the La D√ºsseldorf logo in place of the \\"Klaus Dinger + Japandorf\\" sticker, but this was blocked by Hans Lampe, the only surviving member of the original La D√ºsseldorf. Content \\"Immermannstra√üe\\" is named for a street in D√ºsseldorf's Japanese town which Dinger was introduced to by Kazu and Miki soon after meeting them. The vocals on the song are by Masaki Nakao - it was released as the first YouTube 'single' in advance of the album. \\"Domou Arigatou\\" (Japanese for \\"thank-you very much\\") was recorded by Miki Yui in a Japanese bookshop on Immermannstra√üe. \\"Sketch 1_b\\" is a jam between Kazu and Klaus recorded in 2008, an early version of which was included on the 2009 compilation/Gr√∂nland sampler \\"Brand NEU!\\" under the name \\"Sketch 1_08\\". Onouchi's synthesizer is noticeably less prominent in the Brand NEU! version than the Japandorf version. \\"Udon\\" is named after a Japanese noodle soup, which Nakao cooked when he joined sessions in Zeeland for \\"Viva Remix\\" in 2000. After eating the meal and drinking tequila around the outside campfire, the band returned to the studio where Klaus picked up a guitar and began playing a riff, announcing into the microphone \\"now Nakao will tell us how to cook udon\\". Nakao sung the lyrics to \\"Udon\\" without any prior preparation, and with a few alterations this is how the song appears on the album. \\"Kittelback Symphony\\" is named after Kittelbach, a small river in Unterrath where Dinger grew up. \\"Cha Cha 2008\\" is a cover version of La D√ºsseldorf's song \\"Cha Cha 2000\\", which emerged spontaneously from a jamming session between Kazu and Klaus in 2008, later being overdubbed with vocals and synthesizer. It was the last time Dinger would ever perform the song. \\"Ai\\" is a spoken word description of the Japanese word for love, whilst \\"Sketch No. 4\\" is another jam between Onouchi and Dinger. \\"Spacemelo\\" originated in a melody Miki Yui wrote for a track of the same on her album \\"Magina\\" (released 2010). Dinger played it \\"upside down (kind of backwards)\\" on guitar, and built a song around it. Miki Yui wrote and recorded the vocal part after Dinger's death; the song functions as an homage to Dinger. \\"Karnival\\" was recorded in February 2008 at the time of the D√ºsseldorf carnival, to which it refers. \\"Osenbe\\" was recorded outside at Zeeland near the campfire, with Nakao and Yui providing vocals over Dinger's acoustic guitar before collapsing into laughter. The final track - \\"Andreaskirche\\" - is a recording of church bells at a church in D√ºsseldorf. Reception The album was positively received by most, with Phil Newall of Louder than War calling it \\"a fitting tribute to Klaus Dinger and a suitable closure for the entire La Dusseldorf project\\". A review on Julian Cope's Head Heritage website describes \\"Sketch No. 4\\" as follows‚Äî The album was the best selling record on Gr√∂nland for several weeks after its release.

Family There is some confusion about his parentage. It is often said that he was the third son of Sir Anthony St Leger, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and his wife Agnes Warham. However, both Burke's Peerage,Mosley, ed. Burke's Peerage 107th Edition Delaware 2003 Vol.1 p.1160 and Francis Elrington Ball in his definitive study of the pre-Independence Irish judiciary,Ball, Francis Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 p.225 state that he was the nephew, not the son, of the elder Sir Anthony, and that his parents were Sir Anthony's brother George St Leger and his wife Thomasine Heath. Career He was born around 1535, at Leeds, Kent. He entered Gray's Inn in 1562 and was called to the Bar in 1574. He was made an Ancient of Gray's Inn in 1579 and was Reader of the Inn in 1589.Ball p.225 In 1593 he was made Irish Master of the Rolls, with a knighthood.Ball p.225 Crawford states that he was chosen for the office because of the Crown's strong preference for sending English judges to Ireland, and because of a vague belief that the St. Leger family's long association with Ireland fitted him for the task.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland - the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641 Four Courts Press 2005 p.111 St Leger himself did not share this belief: he went to Ireland under protest, made regular visits home and petitioned for English offices such as Master of the Court of Requests.Ball p.226 His absences from duty were frequent enough to merit an official rebuke: in 1599 the Privy Council of Ireland sent a sharp request to him to return to Dublin at once, since his absence was making the conduct of judicial business almost impossible.Crawford p.278 He did not entirely neglect his official duties: he negotiated with Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone in 1594, was a commissioner for the Plantation of Munster, and went regularly on assize.Ball p.226 However his desire to return to England was as strong as ever, and he finally obtained leave to retire in 1609.Crawford p.111 He continued to advise the Crown on Irish affairs, and died in Cork early in 1613, presumably while on a mission to Ireland. His body was brought back to England and at his own request he was buried beside his first wife Eleanor in the church of St. Sepulchre-without- Newgate in London. Mary, his second wife, is buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Personal life He bought Wierton House, in Boughton Monchelsea in Kent, from the Norton family, and acquired Bobbing Court in Kent through marriage. His will makes generous provision for his widow, and contains legacies to his Clifford stepchildren, numerous cousins and the poor of Leeds. Sir Henry Wotton, the noted poet and diplomat, received a bequest of a ring; since St Leger's third wife Aphra was a Wotton there may have been a family connection between the two men. St Leger married firstly Eleanor, daughter of Richard Markham of Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire; they had one daughter, Joan. Eleanor died in 1599. He married secondly as her fourth husband Mary, daughter of Francis Southwell of Wyndham Hall, Norfolk; her third husband had been the leading soldier Sir Conyers Clifford. They had two children, Anthony and Frances (who lived for only four days). Their son Anthony was knighted in 1627, and died in 1661.Burke's Peerage Vol. 1 p.1160 After Mary's death in childbirth in 1603 he married Aphra Wotton, who outlived him by many years.

Shapur II decisively defeated all the Arab tribes during his campaign, and became known as Dh≈´ al- AktƒÅf to the Arabs, meaning ‚Äúhe who pierces shoulders‚Äù. Arab incursions During the childhood of Shapur II, Arab nomads made several incursions into the Sasanian homeland of Pars, where they raided Gor and its surroundings. Furthermore, they also made incursions into Meshan and Mazun. Shapur II's campaign At the age of 16, Shapur II led an expedition against the Arabs. According to al-Tabari, he hand-picked 1,000 cavalrymen for the campaign, a possible reference to the pushtigban unit. He primarily campaigned against the Iyad tribe in Asoristan and thereafter he crossed the Persian Gulf, reaching al-Khatt, a region between present-day Bahrain and Qatar. He then attacked the Banu Tamim in Hajar mountains. Shapur II reportedly killed a large number of the Arab population and destroyed their water supplies by stopping their wells with sand. After having dealt with the Arabs of eastern Arabia, he continued his expedition into western Arabia and Syrian Desert, where he attacked several cities‚Äîhe even went as far as Medina. Because of his cruel way of dealing with the Arabs, he was called Dh≈´ al-aktƒÅf (, \\"he who pierces shoulders\\") by them. Not only did Shapur II pacify the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, but he also pushed many Arab tribes further into the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, he also deported some Arab tribes by force; the Taghlib to Bahrain and al-Khatt; the Banu Abdul Qays and Banu Tamim to Hajar; the Banu Bakr to Kirman, and the Banu Hanzalah to a place near Hormizd-Ardashir. The Zoroastrian scripture Bundahishn also mentions the Arabian campaign of Shapur II, where it says the following: \\"During the rulership of Shapur (II), the son of Hormizd, the Arabs came; they took Khorig R≈´dbƒÅr; for many years with contempt (they) rushed until Shapur came to rulership; he destroyed the Arabs and took the land and destroyed many Arab rulers and pulled out many number of shoulders\\". Colonies of Persian officials and soldiers were settled in new garrisons along the Arabian coastlands of the Persian Gulf, especially in Oman's strategic coast in Al Batinah Region, including the tip of the Musandam Peninsula, Sohar, and Rustaq.C.

In order to prevent the Arabs to make more raids into his country, Shapur II ordered the construction of a defensive line near al-Hira, which became known as Wall of the Arabs (Middle Persian: war ƒ´ tƒÅzƒ´gƒÅn, in khandaq SƒÅb≈´r, \\"Ditch of Shapur\\").
