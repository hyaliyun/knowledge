Biography = Early life  Konstantinos Dimidis was born in the late 18th century in Grevena. At a young age, He moved to Ayvali searching for employment. There he learned gunsmithing. In 1818 he moved to Paris together with Konstantinos Tompras and they apprenticed typography to Firmin Didot. A year later, returning to Ayvali, together with Tompras they opened a print shop in 1819.  In Psara  At the start of the Greek Revolution, in June 1821, Ayvali was attacked by the Ottomans. Persecuted, he went to Psara, where he became actively involved in the Revolution. There he founded the first improvised print shop of the revolutionary Greeks. In 1824 Konstantinos Dimidis was printing proclamations and naval diplomas. He even aspired to publish a newspaper, and, for this reason, the British philhellene Leicester Stanhope sent to Psara a lithography equipment. The Destruction of Psara in June 1824 foiled his plans.  In Hydra and Nafplio  During the period 1827 ‚Äì 1828 he worked in the print shop of the Italian Giuseppe Chiappe in Hydra, where the newspaper The Friend of the Law was published. Later, Konstantinos Dimidis went to Nafplio. On his own initiative, collaborating again with Konstantinos Tompras, he founded the first private print shop there. In 1828 he printed two books with the titles \\"Arithmetic\\", by Dionysios Pyrrhos, and \\"Summary of the Gospel\\", by Neofytos Nikitopoulos. He then cooperated with Emmanouil Antoniadis, with whom he printed the newspapers \\"Eos\\" (1830 ‚Äì 1831) and \\"Athens\\" (1832 ‚Äì 1833). With Antoniadis, Dimidis manufactured and casted types on site.  In Ermoupoli and Athens  After the departure of Emmanouil Antoniadis to Athens, Konstantinos Dimids decided to move to Syros. In Ermoupoli, he cooperated with Georgios Melistagis and in 1833 they published a newsletter. Until 1836 they had published 10 titles. In 1836 Konstantinos Dimidis left Syros. In 1843 he took over the newly founded Department of Type Creation of the Royal Type Shop, where he worked until his death, in 1869.  His contribution  His contribution to the evolution of Greek typography and the formation of Greek types was immense, as he was the only Greek in the years of the Revolution, but even up to the 1850, who could produce high quality types.

Under his leadership, the Totsuka-ha Yoshin-ry≈´ was the largest jujutsu organization in Japan, as well as the last great school of this art, until the rise of Kodokan judo. Biography He was the elder son of Hidetsuka Totsuka, the founder of the Totsuka branch of Yoshin-ry≈´ jujutsu. While he was learning the family art, Hikosuke served the feudal Numazu Domain in Suruga Province from 1830 until 1837, in which he inherited leadership of the Totsuka family. In 1860, his prestige in the teaching of jujutsu carried to him to an audience with Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi, whom Totsuka showed his style by performing kata in his presence. Iemochi was impressied, so Totsuka started working for the Tokugawa Shogunate as a jujutsu teacher at the Kobusho academy.Êà∏Â°öÂΩ¶‰ªãÔºàË™≠„ÅøÔºâ„Å®„Å•„Åã „Å≤„Åì„Åô„Åë Around this time, he had contact with future Shinsengumi member Shinohara Yasunoshin, who stayed at Totsuka's house and discussed martial principles with him. In 1861, Totsuka departed from the Kobusho due to political changes and decided to settle by himself in Tokyo, opening a system of dojos. Over time, the Totsuka-ha schools in the city were attended by 1.600 students, even although Totsuka moved his residence to Chiba after the 1868 Meiji Restoration. He worked as the main hand-to-hand teacher of the Chiba Police Department, but also taught several great exponents of his art, like Matashiro Kashiwazaki, Jujiro Aizawa, Taro Terushima and Teisuke Nishimura. In the 1880s, his Tokyo students became entangled with the rising Kodokan judo school during the Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry, but Totsuka himself would not see its end, dying of an illness in 1886 in midst of the confrontations. He was succeeded by his adopted son Hidemi, who later joined Kodokan founder Jigoro Kano to form the jujutsu department of Dai Nippon Butoku Kai.

He was appointed as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2010.  Career  Hall studied Civil Engineering at the University of Bristol and graduated in 1990. He was a Civil Engineer with Taylor Woodrow Construction from 1987-1990 and then served with VSO in Guyana from 1991-1993 working on flood protection and drainage projects. He worked with water specialist HR Wallingford from 1993-1995 before returning to Bristol University to undertake a PhD in engineering systems and uncertainty analysis which he completed in 1999. In 2004, he was appointed as the inaugural Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University where he served until 2011. He represented Newcastle University as a member of the Tyndall Centre Consortium, leading the Centre's Cities research programme and became Deputy Director of the Tyndall Centre. He was appointed Director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University where he established a Sustainability Internship for the University. Hall was instrumental in the establishment of the Oxford Networks for the Environment (ONE) which bring together research in the University of Oxford on energy, climate, water, biodiversity and food. In 2018, he stood down as director of the Environmental Change, and in 2020 he became director of research in the School of Geography and the Environment.  Research  He researches risk analysis and decision-making under uncertainty for water resource systems, flood and coastal risk management, infrastructure systems and adaptation to climate change. Water Resources: Hall developed methods for planning water resources in the context of uncertain future climate changes. In 2018, Hall and his former doctoral student Edoardo Borgomeo were awarded the Prince Sultan Abdulaziz International Prize in the category of Water Management and Protection for developing a new risk-based framework to assess water security and plan water supply infrastructure in times of climate change. His research has focused on the quantification of risks from water resource systems especially the risks of water shortages and harmful water quality for people and the environment. This has contributed to the concept and literature of water security although this approach has been criticised as reductionist. With Claudia Sadoff and David Grey he was co-chair of the Global water partnership/OECD Task Force on the Economics of Water Security and Sustainable Growth. . Hall is on the technical panel for the National Infrastructure Commission. His analysis of water risks in Britain provided evidence for the National Infrastructure Commission's 2018 report Preparing for a Drier Future and for the Environment Agency's National framework for Water Resources. He is Editor of the AGU journal Water Resources Research. Flood risk: Hall developed the flood risk analysis for the first National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA) in England and Wales. The same research now also underpins the Environment Agency‚Äôs Long Term Investment Strategy. He also developed the framework for uncertainty analysis in appraisal of options for protecting London from flooding over the 21st Century, as part of the Environment Agency‚Äôs 2012 Thames Estuary 2100 project. He was coordinating lead author in the Government Office of Science and Technology‚Äôs Foresight Future Flooding project and was a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) for the 2014 floods emergency. He was advisor during the 2016 floods and the subsequent National Flood Resilience Review. Hall has published two books on flooding: Flood Risk Management in Europe: Innovation in Policy and Practice and Applied Uncertainty in Flood Risk Management. Coastal Change: With Mike Walkden, Hall developed the SCAPE model which can predict coastal cliff erosion decades into the future. SCAPE has been used to predict the impacts of climate change for coastal towns and nuclear sites. He was part of the team that developed the Tyndall Coastal Simulator which models the response of the East Anglian coast to climate change. Hall conceived the CoastalME modelling environemnt for simulating decadal to centennial morphological changes. He led the Committee on Climate Change‚Äôs 2018 report Managing the coast in a changing climate. Climate Change: Hall's research on adaptation to climate change has focused on climate change risk assessment and decision-making under uncertainty. He was a contributing author to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which won a Nobel Peace Prize. He was an Advisor to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change and led the infrastructure background paper for the Global Commission on Adaptation. Between 2009 and 2019, Hall was a member of the UK Adaptation Committee which is part of the Independent Committee on climate change which was established by the 2008 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment evidence report. He is chair of the Steering Group of the ¬£18.7m UKRI Climate Resilience Programme and served on the Governance Board and the Peer Review Panel for he UK's national climate projections, UKCP 18. Infrastructure Systems: Jim Hall founded the UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium which received two research Programme Grants from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council. Hall led the development of the National Infrastructure Systems Model (NISMOD) which simulates the behaviour and interactions between energy, transport, digital, water and waste systems. NISMOD was used for the National Needs Assessment led by Sir John Armitt and for the UK's first National Infrastructure Assessment. Hall now chairs the ¬£8 million Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. . His book The Future of National Infrastructure sets out the challenges of sustainable infrastructure in the 21st Century and provides a template for assessing long-term policy, planning and investments. NISMOD has been taken up by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals and has been used to inform infrastructure planning in Curacao, St Lucia and Ghana. Hall developed several methods for analysing risks to infrastructure networks and prioritising actions to enhance network resilience. The work was used as part of the National Infrastructure Commission‚Äôs 2020 study of infrastructure resilience. The work has twice been recognised with the award of the Lloyd's Science Prize and it has been applied to the analysis of infrastructure network resilience in Tanzania, Vietnam, Argentina and China and at global scale. Uncertainty and decision analysis: Hall applied generalised theories of probability to civil engineering and environmental systems, including random set theory, the theory of imprecise probability and info-gap theory. He applied the theory of imprecise probabilities to analyse tipping points in the Earth System.  Alpinism  Jim Hall has climbed new routes in Europe, North America, South America, the Himalayas and the Antarctic. He achieved the first ascent of South Face Thunder Mountain (Alaska) with Paul Ramsden and Nick Lewis, the first winter ascents of Cerro Poincenot and Aig Guillaumet and a winter ascent of Fitzroy Supercouloir (Patagonia) with Paul Ramsden, Nick Lewis and Andy Kirkpatrick, recounted in Kirkpatrick's book Psychovertical.

At the time of his death in 1993, he was the longest-serving faculty in the history of Stanford University, getting hired in 1926 as an assistant professor and retiring in 1965. Luck authored more than 200 scientific publications, and mentored the future Nobel laureate Paul D. Boyer. While at Stanford, he started the academic journal Annual Review of Biochemistry, first published in 1932. After adding a second title in physiology, the advisory committee of the journal changed its name to Annual Reviews, which publishes fifty-one journals as of 2020. Luck served as a science attach√©, spending two years at the US Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, and two months each at the embassies in London and Stockholm. He took an interest in cooperative organization, helping establish the Palo Alto Co-op, which were consumer-owned grocery stores. He also cofounded the Palo Alto Credit Union (cooperative banking) and the Peninsula Housing Association (cooperative housing). Early life and education James Murray Luck was born in Paris, Ontario on October 23, 1899 as the youngest of five children to his parents, Nina Victoria Coulson and Horatio Washington Luck. In 1922, he graduated with a bachelor of science degree from University of Toronto, which was followed by a PhD in biochemistry from University of Cambridge in 1925. While at Cambridge, he studied the origin of ammonia in the bloodstream with Frederick Gowland Hopkins and J. B. S. Haldane. Career=Research and academic societies After graduating from Cambridge, Luck returned to the University of Toronto and worked for a year as a \\"Demonstrator\\" in biochemistry. In 1926, Luck began teaching biochemistry as an assistant professor at Stanford University. In 1934, he was made an associate professor, and in 1941 a full professor. He retired in 1965, making him the longest- serving faculty member at Stanford. In the course of his career, he authored more than 200 scientific publications. One of the graduate students he mentored, Paul D. Boyer, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997. He served as Secretary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science-- Pacific Division from 1929-1944, and served as president by 1957. He was also a member of various committees for the American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, the Medical Fellowship Board, the National Research Council, and National Science Foundation. For several years, he was head of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's Section on Biological Chemistry. Luck was the namesake of the James Murray Luck Award for Excellence in Scientific Reviewing, which was created in 1979 by the National Academy of Sciences. Annual Reviews Luck was the founder of Annual Review of Biochemistry, which published its first issue in 1932. Luck decided to offer a course on current research in biochemistry to graduate students. In designing the course, he said he felt \\"knee-deep in trouble\\", as he only felt sufficiently knowledgeable about a few areas of biochemistry relative to the graduate students. Additionally, the volume of current research was overwhelming, with 6,500 abstracts regarding biochemistry published in Chemical Abstracts in 1930. In July 1930, Luck wrote to about 50 biochemists in the US, United Kingdom, and Canada to ask if an annual volume of critical reviews on biochemistry research would be useful, to which he received positive responses. His correspondence suggested possible authors and topics for his first several volumes. Stanford University Press agreed to publish the journal on a three-year contract, with financial assistance from the Chemical Foundation. Prior to this, Luck's only experience in the publishing industry was working for a summer as a book salesman in Western Canada. Volume I was published in July 1932, consisting of thirty reviews from thirty-five authors of nine different countries; the volume was 724 pages. At the completion of the contract with Stanford University Press, the Advisory Committee of the journal, which included Carl L. Alsberg, Denis Hoagland, and Carl L. A. Schmidt, decided to assume a legal identity as the journal's publisher, though keeping Stanford University Press as the printer. On December 12, 1934, they submitted articles of incorporation with the California Secretary of State to create Annual Review of Biochemistry, Ltd., which was organized as a nonprofit. In February 1938, the name was changed to Annual Reviews, Inc. In 1938, Annual Reviews and the American Physiological Society agreed to collaborate to create a new journal, with the first volume of Annual Review of Physiology published in 1939. A third journal, Annual Review of Microbiology, was created in 1947. Luck participated in administrative work for Annual Reviews until his retirement from the Editor-in-Chief position in 1967 or 1968. At the time of his retirement, Annual Reviews had thirteen titles. Diplomacy In 1962, he was made the science attach√© of the US Embassy in Bern, Switzerland. He served for two years, saying he \\"fell completely in love with Switzerland\\", authoring three books related to this history of science in Switzerland: Science in Switzerland (1965), Modern Switzerland, and History of Switzerland: The First Hundred Thousand Years; From Before the Beginnings to the Days of the Present (1985). He served at the US Embassy in London for a period of two months in 1967, and for another two months as acting science attach√© at the embassy in Stockholm. Other interests Luck had an interest in nutrition science, and conducted a local survey each year on the cost of a balanced diet from the 1950s to the 1960s. Luck published his first book in 1945, The War on Malnutrition and Poverty: The Role of the Consumer Cooperatives. As President of the Pacific Division of American Association for the Advancement of Science, Luck gave a speech in regards to human population growth, saying that abortion should be permitted and encouraged in some cases, which proved highly controversial. In its obituary of him, the New York Times called Luck \\"an early advocate of abortion as a means of worldwide population control\\". Personal life and death Luck was married to Eroeda Nicholaevna Sinitskaya Luck in 1947; they had a son and daughter together. He was one of the founders of the Palo Alto Co-op, which became consumer-owned grocery stores, the Palo Alto Credit Union, and the Peninsula Housing Association, a housing cooperative. Luck died of cardiac failure on August 26, 1993, at his home in Menlo Park, California. He was 93.

Its alternative name of Thirty-One refers to the combination of three trump cards that wins the game. One of the main variants of this game is known as Kozel (\\"goat\\") or Bura Kozel. It is a point-trick game with the unusual feature that players may lead several cards of the same suit at once.Bura at pagat.com. Retrieved 21 August 2020.  Cards  A 36-card, French-suited pack is used. Cards rank in their natural order and are worth the usual Ace-Ten game values: Ace (Tuz) 11 points, Ten (Desyatka) 10 points, King (Corol) 4 points, Queen (Dama) 3 points, Jack (Valet) 2 points, remainder 0 points.  Rules  The game is best for two or three; McLeod states that two is normal. The aim is to be the first to take at least 31 points in trick. First dealer is determined by lots; thereafter the winner of a deal deals for the next. Each player is antes a stake to the pot. The dealer then gives 3 cards, individually, to each player and turns the next for trumps. The rest of the stock is placed, face down and crosswise, on top of it. If two play, the non-dealer leads to the first trick; if three play, the player to the dealer's left has this privilege. A card may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit and any plain suit card is beaten by any trump. Suit need not be followed - any card may be played. A player with two or three cards of the same suit may play them simultaneously and each card must be beaten for a subsequent player to win the cards. There is no requirement to win the trick even if you are able. The following card combinations, if declared, allow a player to 'steal' the lead: * Bura (\\"borer\\" or \\"cutter\\") - any three trumps. Wins immediately. * Moscow (Moskva) - three Aces. Wins immediately. * Little Moscow - three Sixes including the trump. * Molodka (\\"young lady\\") or Pismo (\\"letter\\") - three cards of the same plain suit. If any of these occur in the first trick, the cards are redealt without penalty. If two or more players announce declarations at the start of the same trick, the following rules apply: * Moscow takes precedence over Bura. * Molodka is outranked by any of the other declarations. * If two or more have a Molodka, positional priority applies. * If two or more have a Bura, the player with positional priority leads and whoever wins the trick wins the pot. * In the event of a successful Bura or Moscow, the winner sweeps the pot. Players replenish their hands from the stock, singly and in clockwise order, beginning with the trick winner. If there are not enough cards in the stock to go around, the stock is not used. A player who draws too many cards or draws cards out of turn has lost.Bura at igralniekarti.ru. Retrieved 16 June 2017. Play ends when a player claims to have reached 31 or more points. This must be done from memory - players may not examine their tricks. If the claim is true, the winner sweeps the pot; if he is wrong, he must double the pot. If played for points, one game point is awarded for a win; two to each opponent if someone incorrectly goes out having not scored 31. Game is then 21 (Robber) or 11 (Little Robber).

Its highest point is above sea level. The Chatsworth Estate lies to the west and Umberley Brook run along its east edge. East Moor is the broader moorland area covering Gibbet Moor, Brampton East Moor and Beeley Moor. Gibbet Moor is a prehistoric landscape with several protected Scheduled Ancient Monuments. A gibbet was a wooden structure (like a gallows), where the dead bodies of criminals were hung on display. The last person to be gibbeted alive in England was a vagrant who was begging for food around Baslow and killed a woman in her cottage. The murderer was left to die in a gibbet cage on Gibbet Moor in the 17th century. A widespread Bronze Age settlement covers a stretch of moorland over 1km long. The complex includes a stone circle, more than 250 cairns, cemeteries of burial mounds (barrows) and remains of field enclosures and building platforms of probable farm houses. The stone circle has an outer ring of standing stones about 10m in diameter, with an inner square of standing stones (with three of the \\"four poster\\" stones remaining). The historic landscape has been modified by World War II training exercises. The site is a Scheduled Monument. To the west of the large prehistoric settlement is another cairnfield and field system, which is a separate Scheduled Monument. This formed part of the same Bronze Age cultivation landscape but was separated by more recent land enclosures. A Bronze Age cairn cemetery on the eastern edge of the moor is a further Scheduled Monument. The largest cairn is 10m long with at least seven other cairns nearby. Hob Hurst's House is an unusual square Bronze Age burial cairn on Harland Edge (between Gibbet Moor and Beeley Moor). Thomas Bateman excavated the barrow in 1853 and discovered a stone cist containing cremated remains. It has been a protected national monument since 1882. Until 1824 Gibbet Moor was common land and then the Enclosures Act allocated the land of Gibbet Moor to the Duke of Rutland. In an exchange of lands, the 6th Duke of Devonshire acquired the 652 acres of Gibbet Moor to extend his Chatsworth Estate to the east. Gibbet Moor became \\"Open Access\\" land for the public, following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs along the track on the west side of the moor.

Hanley and published in August 2020 by PublicAffairs, an imprint of Perseus Books Group, part of the Hachette Book Group. The book tells the story of the war through the experiences of 20 individuals who lived through it, of several nationalities and walks of life.  Synopsis  The present-tense narrative unfolds chronologically in interwoven episodes describing the experiences of featured individuals, beginning with that of a North Korean refugee girl in Seoul, South Korea, on June 25, 1950, the morning the war began with an invasion of the South by the northern army. The other protagonists are a North Korean communist party functionary; a mother of two in Seoul; Major General Yu Song- chol, the North Korean army operations chief; Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway, the U.S. army‚Äôs operations chief; a North Korean Naval Academy cadet; a black American infantryman; a Maryknoll nun; a northern medical student; a U.S. 1st Cavalry Division soldier; a Korean journalist in Seoul; a British communist journalist; a Seoul high school student; a high school student from Kochang, South Korea; a female Seoul university student; a Chinese interpreter at the truce talks; a U.S. Marine officer; a U.S. 7th Infantry Division soldier; overall Chinese commander General Peng Teh-huai; and a Chinese army medic. These individuals observe or participate in the war‚Äôs major events: the U.S.-South Korean retreat into the defensive Pusan Perimeter; the Inchon Landing; the breakout from the perimeter; the U.S.-South Korean drive deep into North Korea; the intervention of the Chinese army on North Korea‚Äôs side; the seesawing battles over the peninsula‚Äôs midsection; the trench warfare of 1951-1953; the truce talks; the signing of an armistice on July 27, 1953. Protagonists also witness or are caught up in the war‚Äôs atrocities, including the secret mass executions of tens of thousands of political prisoners in South Korea; the Americans‚Äô massacre of hundreds of southern refugees at No Gun Ri; the U.S. aerial strafing of southern refugee columns; the indiscriminate U.S. bombing of northern civilian centers; the North Koreans‚Äô summary ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs court‚Äù executions of police and other southern officials. The 504-page volume also includes six maps, a war chronology, 60 photos of general war scenes and of the protagonists, and epilogues, including a section briefly recounting their postwar lives.  Reviews  The three major publishing industry magazines all awarded Ghost Flames ‚Äústarred‚Äù reviews. Kirkus Reviews called it ‚Äúa masterly new history. ‚Ä¶ The accretion of astounding detail makes for a vivid, multilayered look at a deeply complicated war in which few emerged as heroic. A top-notch addition to the literature on the Korean War.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"Hanley paints an extraordinary portrait of the war's complexity and devastation. This is an essential account of America's ‚Äòforgotten war‚Äô.\\" In Library Journal, reviewer Michael Rodriguez described it as ‚Äúan extraordinary kaleidoscope of human experiences in a catastrophic forgotten war.\\" In The New York Times, reviewer Gordon G. Chang wrote, ‚ÄúIn unforgettable fashion, Hanley ‚Ä¶ tells the story of the Korean War, one of the most savage conflicts in history, through eyewitness accounts of 20 people, most of them victims.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Arthur Herman found Ghost Flames to be a ‚Äúharrowing account, in all its vivid detail‚Äù and ‚Äúcompelling reading‚Äù that ‚Äúdelves into the darker recesses of this conflict.‚Äù But he criticized what he contended was an effort to draw ‚Äúmoral equivalence‚Äù between the two sides, claiming instead that North Korea bore responsibility for all the estimated 3 million deaths for having started the war.

The stops opened in August 2020, replacing a pair of two-way stops nearby. History An inbound train at 7th Avenue in 2019 The N Judah line opened on October 21, 1928. By the 2010s, trains stopped on Irving at several cross streets including 4th Avenue and 7th Avenue. Passengers had to cross travel lanes to board, and neither stop was accessible. In March 2014, Muni released details of the proposed implementation of their Transit Effectiveness Project (later rebranded MuniForward), which included a variety of stop changes for the N Judah line. Two stops on Irving Street at 4th Avenue and 7th Avenue would be consolidated into a single stop between 5th and 6th Avenues, with transit bulbs constructed to allow passengers to board directly from the sidewalk. The eastbound bulb would be adjacent to 5th Avenue, with the westbound bulb adjacent to 6th Avenue. Both bulbs include accessible mini-high platforms. Two subprojects - accessible platforms at 28th Avenue, and improvements on Irving Street between 9th Avenue and Arguello - were selected for early implementation in coordination with rail replacement and seismic refitting of the Sunset Tunnel. The latter project (the Inner Sunset Streetscape Project) began construction during weekend shutdowns of the line in September 2017.

Early life Carey was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 12, 1916. He was one of six sons born to Margaret (n√©e Collins) Carey, a former secretary to journalist Nellie Bly, and Dennis Joseph Carey Sr. Among his siblings were brothers Dennis J. Carey Jr. (president of the family firm), Hugh L. Carey (a former U.S. Representative who served as Governor of New York from 1975 to 1982), John R. Carey, Martin T. Carey, and George G. Carey. His youngest brother, George, a securities analyst, was killed in a plane crash in 1959. He was a graduate of St. Augustine's School in the Bronx and attended Manhattan College and St. John's University. Career In the 1930s, together with his parents, he founded Peerless Oil Company (later known as Peerless Petrochemicals), the petroleum transport business. In the early 1940s, Carey formed the New England Petroleum Corporation, based in Brooklyn, which became one of the nation's largest \\"privately owned petroleum refining and marketing companies.\\" The company specialized in supplying petroleum products to electrical utilities on the East Coast, and had interests in oil exploration and production in the Persian Gulf, North Africa, and the North Sea. In 1968, Carey teamed up with Standard Oil of California (today known as the Chevron Corporation) to set up the Bahamas Oil Refining Company, of which Carey was chairman, to establish and run a $60 million refinery in the Bahamas to process Standard Oil's sweet crude oil from Libya. Carey's New England Petroleum Corp. then sold the oil to utilities in the Northeastern United States, which had been under pressure to reduce pollution by burning cleaner fuels. The Bahamas venture, headquartered in Freeport, was largely financed by Standard Oil, ran into difficulties after the 1973 oil crisis when Libya also nationalized its foreign-held oil into the National Oil Corporation. After supplies to the refinery dwindled, Standard Oil and Carey fell into a series of disputes which were further agitated by Federal regulations put in place to deal because of oil prices rising worldwide. By the end of 1978, the plant was in receivership, $300 million in debt to the National Oil Cormpanies of Libya and Iran and $100 million in debt to Standard Oil of California. In 1979, Carey sold Carey Energy Corporation, with $550 million in assets, to the Jacksonville, Florida based Charter Company for $4 million in cash (for 20% of the company) and $16 million in Charter convertible preferred stock (worth $45 million), plus a consulting contract for Carey that paid $200,000 per year. Carey Energy's principal assets were a 65% ownership in the Bahamas Refinery (Standard Oil owned the remaining 35%) as well as the New England Petroleum Company. Charter beat out Ashland Oil who were also interested in acquiring Carey Energy. > \\"The deal hinged on an unusual contract with the Libyans. The contract tied > the payments that Charter had to make against Carey's outstanding bills to > the amount of oil the Libyans supplied. It thus solved the problem that had > made it impossible for Carey to continue in business: the refusal of the > company's suppliers to provide any more oil on credit.\\" The contract with Libya, plus a substantial increase in refinery profit margins that accompanied the 1979 oil shortage, \\"enabled Charter to settle all of its debts with Carey's foreign suppliers just four months after it had taken over the company.\\" By 1982, however, the refinery \\"that once turned crude into cash is now considered a money-losing white elephant\\" and led to Charter losing much of its value. Charter executives claimed that earnings from other assets acquired from Carey Energy \\"more than offset the Bahamian losses.\\" Charter filed for bankruptcy protection in late 1984, eventually selling off all of its businesses and purchasing Spelling Entertainment Inc. Commonwealth Oil Refining Company In 1953, Carey helped found the Commonwealth Oil Refining Company, Inc. in the Puerto Rico under the development program known as Operation Bootstrap. Carey organized Commonwealth with Rear Admiral Andrew F. Carter (former president of Shell Eastern Petroleum Products, Inc. and a senior executive with the Army-Navy Petroleum Board during World War II), Charles W. Saacke (a former executive with the Davison Chemical Company which was acquired by W. R. Grace and Company in 1954), and Fred Gilbert of Carey's New England Petroleum. The company ran a petrochemical plant and $24,500,000 refinery at Ponce. Commonwealth Oil, which processed , was also sold to Charter for $650 million in 1980. In the late 1950s, Carey was involved in a consortium of American companies to set up a capital market in Puerto Rico. Personal life In 1941, he married the Elizabeth Ann \\"Betty\\" Sullivan (d. 2000). Together, they were the parents of three children: * Edward Charles Carey, who married Eileen Campion Cahill, a daughter of Dr. John Cahill, in 1966. After her death, Edward married her sister, Moreen Cathleen Cahill (1945‚Äì2020), in 1971. * Diane Margaret Carey, who married Myles Charles Cunningham, a son of John J. Cunningham (vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), in 1968. * Jane Elizabeth Carey, who married Thomas Alan Haswell, who worked for Carey's New England Petroleum Corp., in 1971.

He practised law in South Africa from 1928 until his retirement in 1992 and was widely regarded as ‚Äúpre-eminent among his generation of advocates‚Äù and ‚Äúone of the country‚Äôs most formidable legal minds.‚Äù In addition to a legal practice, he is best known for his defence of those prosecuted for their political beliefs and ‚Äúas a man whose life and interests reflected a deep concern for human rights and civil liberty.‚Äù He was the leader of the defence team in the famous South African Treason Trial of 1956 to 1961 in which the accused, including Nelson Mandela, were all acquitted as well as numerous other cases in which he represented individuals adversely affected by the apartheid government's oppressive legislation. He served on the bench of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia from May 1961 to June 1963. Early life and education Maisels was born in November 1905 in Johannesburg. His father, Henry, had come with his siblings and parents in the 1890s from Pokroy, a small village in Lithuania and his mother from Lodz in Poland. He attended the Marist Brothers‚Äô preparatory and high school and received his undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, graduating from the law school in 1927. He married Muriel Maisels on 28 June 1934 and the couple had four children. Legal Career Following his graduation, he served in a firm of attorneys for two years as an ‚Äúarticled clerk‚Äù and was admitted to the Bar as an advocate of the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1930. In May 1940 he volunteered for the South African Armed Forces and was assigned to the Air Force Intelligence and dispatched to Nairobi, Kenya. He returned to South Africa in 1941 and was discharged from the Army with the rank of Major in October 1944. Prior to his discharge, he declined an offer of the position of Judge Advocate of the Armed Forces. His law practice grew rapidly, and he was appointed a King‚Äôs Counsel (KC) in 1948 and Queen‚Äôs Counsel (QC) following the death of King George VI. He served as chairman of the Johannesburg Bar Council from 1952 -1960 and was vice-chairman and acting chairman of the General Council of the South African Bar from 1954 ‚Äì 1960. In his position as leader of the Johannesburg Bar, he opposed several pieces of oppressive legislation enacted by the government, including the Suppression of Communism Act which led to the persecution and imprisonment of many, but his commercial practice flourished. In 1956, a Vickers Viscount airplane operated by the Central African Airways (CAA) disintegrated over Tanzania, killing all passengers and crew. Maisels represented the CAA and was able to demonstrate that the crash was the result of metal fatigue due to faulty material. Vickers Armstrong paid all of the damages claimed as well as the legal costs. In 1960 David Pratt attempted to assassinate Hendrik Verwoerd, South Africa‚Äôs Prime Minister, who survived the attack. Maisels defended Pratt who was found guilty but insane and committed to a mental institution where he committed suicide one year later. Maisels represented the Consolidated Diamond Mines of South West Africa (CDMSWA) in what came to be known as ‚Äúthe great Southwest African Diamond Case.‚Äù The CDMSWA was owned by the Anglo-American Corporation of which Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was the chairman. The case involved an area of some 10,000 miles of the West Coast of South-West Africa (now Namibia) and the question of the rights to prospect for diamonds between the high and low watermarks along the beaches. In a case that lasted more than one year, Maisels was successful in securing the sole and exclusive rights for CDMSWA. Maisels is perhaps best known for his role as the leader of the defence team (that included Bram Fischer and Sydney Kentridge), in the South African Treason Trial in which 156 people of all races, including Chief Albert Luthuli, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Oliver Tambo, the ANC vice president and Nelson Mandela were arrested in December 1956 and charged with treason. Following a preparatory examination which ended in January 1958, the charges against Luthuli, who gave evidence as a witness in the trial and Tambo were withdrawn and 91 individuals, including Nelson Mandela, were committed for trial. The trial which attracted much international attention was in two parts - the First and Second Indictment. The First Indictment commenced on 1 August 1958. The State‚Äôs case was cumbersome and vague and, on 13 October 1958, it was withdrawn by the State after being picked apart by Maisels and his team. The State rallied, however, and the same trial, this time with fewer defendants (but including Mandela), commenced in August 1959. Following the Preparatory Examination, when Maisels was approached by the accused to take charge of their defence, he insisted that the defence, in this case, be conducted strictly on legal, and not political, grounds. Although the defendants initially opposed this, it subsequently was proven to be the appropriate strategy. This Second Indictment was more specific than the First and alleged that the defendants intended a violent overthrow of the Apartheid government. The trial finally ended in March 1961 with the acquittal of all the accused. During the trial, Maisels cross-examined professor Andrew Murray who was called by the Crown as an expert on communism. In the cross-examination, Maisels enumerated the multiple discriminatory laws that had been passed for decades against the non-whites of South Africa and became increasingly harsh and more pervasive following 1948 when the Nationalist Party government came to power. Following this exchange, Maisels was approached by Duma Nokwe, a black lawyer who had been one of the initial accused but dismissed following the preparatory examination. He asked Maisels whether he had notes on his cross-examination and when asked why he said: ‚ÄúI would like to get those notes because I did not know things were quite so bad.‚Äù Following the Treason Trial, Maisels moved to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1961 where he served as a judge of the high court. Soon after his arrival, however, Northern Rhodesia withdrew from the Rhodesian Federation, and the Southern Rhodesian government was replaced by a right-wing party which led to the passage of increasingly harsh legislation which Maisels could not condone. He resigned his position in 1963 and returned to South Africa becoming an executive director of the OK Bazaars, the largest South African retail company of its time, where he worked for 7 years before returning to the Bar in 1970 where he rapidly resumed a busy practice. In 1966 he was appointed as a Justice of the Appeal Courts of the former British Protectorates, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. As these courts only sat for 2-3 months of the year, he continued his law practice at the Johannesburg Bar. He was subsequently appointed Judge President (Chief Justice) of all three countries and served until his retirement in 1987. In 1974 he represented the Rhodesian African National Congress in their talks with the then Rhodesian government at the Victoria Falls. In 1977 he served on a two-person commission of the Medical Association of South Africa to investigate the death in detention of Black consciousness leader Steve Biko. Service to the Jewish Community Maisels was an observant Jew and deeply involved in Jewish and Zionist causes for his entire life. He served as the president of the United Hebrew Congregation and president of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the South African Zionist Federation and the Israel United Appeal. He was a member of the Board of Governors of Israel‚Äôs Jewish Agency for 10 years and a Trustee of the Weizmann Institute. Israeli Prime Ministers whom he hosted, or who enjoyed the hospitality of his home, included Menachem Begin (at the time a member of Israel‚Äôs opposition party), Moshe Sharett, Yitzchak Rabin and Ben Gurion (following his retirement).

Life Sister Celeste Bowe was born Catherine Mary Bowe also known as Ina in Newberry, Mallow, County Cork on 23 February 1931. Her parents were James and Julia Bowe (n√©e Ducey). Her father was a labourer. She attended the local national and secondary schools. She went to St Vincent's Hospital, Pinner, Middlesex in 1949 to train as a nurse, taking first place in the final examinations in Great Britain in 1951. She qualified in 1953 as a state registered nurse at St John's and St Elizabeth's Hospital, London. She returned as a staff nurse to St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin. On 20 February 1956, Bowe entered the Congregation of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in Dublin. She received her habit in Paris on 9 September 1957 under the name Sister Celeste. She was a novice from 1957 to 1961 in Cork, professing on 15 March 1961. She was a nurse in the North Infirmary, Cork, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin, and St Vincent's, Pinner. In 1965 she was awarded the London University diploma in nursing and in 1967 she received her nurse tutor diploma at University College Dublin. She then qualified as a registered nurse for those with mental disabilities. She was appointed principal tutor at St Joseph's Hospital for the mentally handicapped at Rosewell, near Edinburgh, Scotland in 1967. During this period in the 1960s and early 1970s, these institutions were custodial. Bowe studied the advances in mental handicap nursing from Kansas, United States, receiving a Churchill scholarship to study the normalisation of children with learning disabilities in Scandinavia. There she was introduced to the concepts of community and individualised care for those with learning disabilities. She applied the reward system from the Kansas model as well as developing the person-centred training system which focused on maximising the children in their care. She also introduced music for therapy and recreation. St Joseph's established a registered course in nursing for those with learning disabilities, with student nurses from Scottish general hospitals attending St Joseph's for three months of nurse training. Bowe was part of the foundation of a special boarding school for children aged 4 to 18 years in 1969. Alongside the principal tutor at Lennox Castle Hospital, Glasgow, Daniel Williamson, Bowe developed a course for nurses designed specifically for children with mental disabilities. Bowe developed a reputation as the national authority for the nursing and care of those with learning disabilities, serving on relevant committees under the Nursing Council for Scotland and the Royal College of Nursing on the Scottish Board. She was the chair of the Lothian Region Nursing and Midwifery Consultative Committee and lectured at the Royal College of Nursing on the postgraduate management courses. In 1973 she was a member and chair of the Lothian health council, advocating for those with learning disabilities. She also created a professional study group at the University of Edinburgh on the subject. She was the first nun or Catholic to be appointed to the General Nursing Council of Scotland. She was awarded the MBE in 1975 for services to nursing. Bowe died in Chalmers Hospital, Edinburgh on 9 August 1975, and is buried in St Matthew's cemetery, Rosewell.

Her actions were admired by her potential rival, Sima Yi, who gave her the role to continue the legacy of the Cao lineage. The most notable information about her comes from Huangfu Mi's Biographies of Exemplary Women (ÂàóÂ•≥ÂÇ≥, Lien√º Zhuan), which was supposed to be an instructional text for confucian women. Due to her heroic act of remaining loyal to the Cao family even when them was in disgrace, she was immortalized as one of the most memorable acts of loyalty performed by a woman in Chinese history.  Genealogy and arrival to the Cao family  Xiahou Lingnu born was born as the daughter of Xiahou Wenning. Among her relatives are the famous generals Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan, who served Cao Cao the founder of the state of Cao Wei. Other possible relatives of her are; Lady Xiahou, who married Zhang Fei from Shu Han state; Xiahou Ba, a Cao Wei general who defected to Shu State shortly after the Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions; and Xiahou Hui, member of the Cao family and wife of Sima Shi (Sima Yi's son), her death could have started tensions between the Sima clan and the Cao clan. The daughters of Lady Xiahou (wife of Zhang Fei and niece of Xiahou Yuan), Empress Jing'ai and Empress Zhang became empresses of the state of Shu Han, making the Xiahou clan divided between the two factions. Lingnu entered a political marriage with Cao Wenshu and supported Cao Shuang reign. Her husband was the cousin of Cao Shuang, the regent of Cao Wei, making her an upper class aristocrat. During the marriage she had no children.  Incident at Gaoping Tombs  Shortly before a coup d'√©tat against Cao Shuang began, Xiahou Lingnu's husband passed away. Due to the growing contention against the members of the Cao clan and the growing popularity of the Sima clan, Lingnu's father joined the traitorous forces against Cao Wei. In order to sever ties with Cao Wei, Xiahou Wenning decided to marry Lingnu into a new family. So great was her desire to preserve her honor and her allegiance to the Cao family that she cut her hair and ears as a sign of refusal. In 5 February 249, Cao Shuang and his two brothers, Cao Xi (ÊõπÁæ≤) and Cao Xun (ÊõπË®ì), left the imperial capital Luoyang to accompany the emperor Cao Fang to pay respects to his ancestors at the Gaoping Tombs (È´òÂπ≥Èôµ). After that, they proceeded to go on a hunting expedition outside Luoyang. Sima Yi, a famous general who Lingnu's father admire, seized the opportunity to launch a coup d'√©tat and take command of the military forces stationed in Luoyang. When Sima Yi took control of the capital city of Luoyang and issuing a memorial which listed out the various crimes Cao Shuang had committed. Cao Shuang surrendered and gave up his powers after further receiving reassurance that he and his family would be spared. After this, Sima Yi then went to see Empress Dowager Guo and coerce her into issuing an imperial order for the arrest of Cao Shuang and his brothers under charges of treason. In 9 February, Cao Shuang, his brothers, and his supporters were charged with treason and executed along with their families. After Cao Shuang's death, Xiahou Lingnu cut her nose in response to her family's request to sever ties with the disgraced Cao clan. Aghast at her actions, they said, \\"Our life in this world is like a particle of light dust on a blade of weak grass. Why torment yourself to this extent? Besides, your husband‚Äôs family is completely exterminated. What purpose does it serve for you to persevere in your chastity?\\". Insulting her family's cowardly act, Lingnu replied: > \\"I have heard that a person of worth does not renounce his principles > because of changes in fortune, nor a righteous person change his mind with a > view to preservation or destruction. While the Cao flourished, I was bent on > keeping my chastity. Now that they have declined and perished, can I bear to > renounce them? Even animals do not act this way; how can I?\\" When Sima Yi heard of Lingnu's heroic action, he praised her loyalty and allowed her to adopt a son, relative to Cao Shuang, to continue the Cao lineage. The coup d'√©tat increased the Sima family's influence and paved the way for the eventual replacement of the Cao Wei regime by the Sima family's Jin dynasty in 266. During one of Jiang Wei's campaigns against Cao Wei in the north, Xiahou ba surrenders to the Shu kingdom. The reason for the surrender was the coup d'√©tat against Cao Shuang, so Xiahou Ba was opposed to serving the Sima clan. The Xiahou clan that served the Cao clan for many decades surrenders to the enemy of its ancestors, the Shu Han state. Xiahou Lingnu continued in the domain of the Sima clan, she raised a son who was directly related to Cao Cao. With this child, she was charged with continuing the legacy of the Cao family.

Charlotte Manson (born ) is an American former radio actress whose career was interrupted by paralysis. Manson was born and raised in Brooklyn. From ages 5 through 8, she performed in children's plays at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Also as a child, she participated in Junior Olympics. Manson was the first female member of Madison High School's debate team. She attended Hunter College, where her performance as Ophelia in the dramatic club's production of Hamlet led to her receiving a scholarship to New York University (NYU) if she would act with the Washington Square Players, which she did. She graduated from NYU with a degree in English in 1938. In 1939, she acted in summer stock on Long Island. Early in her career, Manson appeared in a few films as an extra and in bit parts. After she became regularly employed in radio, she received a contract to star in a film, but the producer found another actress whom he preferred for the role. Manson's contract was paid off the day she arrived in Hollywood, ending that opportunity. Manson's early work in radio included a variety of roles in different programs. Her career gained stability, however, when a radio director saw her perform on Broadway in a Theater Guild production of Ringside Seat. The result was a long-term contract to star as Bryn Barrington in Society Girl on CBS radio. Following that role, she moved to Chicago, where she starred in the drama Stepmother for 18 months. She later had the leading female role in King's Row. Her other roles on radio included Marjorie Whitney on The Romance of Helen Trent, Rose Kransky on Guiding Light, Patsy Bowen on Nick Carter, Master Detective and Dr. Carson McVicker on Road of Life. She also was a supporting actress on The Brighter Day. Manson was active in commercials on radio. Her roles in that regard included being the Camay Girl on Big Sister, the Puritan Girl on True or False, the Ronson Girl on Twenty Questions, and the Speidell Girl on Stop the Music. Perhaps her biggest commercial role was as Carol Douglas, beauty consultant. The manufacturer of the products she endorsed paid six secretaries to write letters answering beauty questions that listeners addressed to the fictitious Douglas. On September 14, 1958, Manson fell down steps in an accident that caused a double fracture of her neck and paralyzed her. However, citing her faith in God and in herself, she resisted her doctors' prognosis that she might never walk again. After 10 weeks, she began wearing a steel brace and had some movement. She was able to resume playing Gillian Gray on This Is Nora Drake on radio. Her brace was removed on February 15, 1959, and her doctors at the Hospital for Joint Diseases in Manhattan described her recovery as a \\"medical miracle\\". Personal life In 1949, Manson married singer Dick Brown in New York. In her spare time she visited New York radio stations promoting his records.

History  Placa con el Premio, al frente del edificio la Comunidad Amijai en Buenos Aires In 1993 several Jewish families in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires decided to form a new Masorti synagogue and chose Dar√≠o Feiguin as their Rabbi. The name of the new synagogue, \\"Amijai\\" means \\"my nation lives\\" in Hebrew. Their first few services were held at the Seminario Rab√≠nico Latinoamericano. In 2001, thanks to a donation from businessman Natalio Garber, former owner of Musimundo, the congregation purchased an old safe factory next to Chinatown to construct their own building.Historias Curiosas de Templos de Buenos Aires, Marcos Gabriel Vanzini, P√°g.48 y 213, , 2011 The congregation chose architecture firm Urgell-Penedo-Urgell, winner of the Konex Award for architecture to design their building. The building took 16 months to complete and involved input from a variety of different architects. After the 1994 AMIA Bombing, the synagogue was built to be bomb-proof. In total, the space takes up about 3,500 m2. The building includes a community dining hall, classrooms, administrative offices for staff and Rabbis, a library and meeting spaces. The building was constructed out of reinforced concrete and includes a V-shaped roof which allows for 25 meters of light to enter the building. The main temple is used for concerts and is known for its good acoustics. In 2008 the building won the First Prize in Architecture from the Government of the Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires as one of the best examples of architecture in the city.Premios de Arquitectura Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Edici√≥n 2008 , Sociedad Central de ArquitectosDistinciones para el estudio Urgell Penedo Urgell en 2012, ArquiNoticias N¬∞ 171, 31 October 2012 The doors of the main temple are made of natural bronze. The Altar was made of carved wood by local artists. The main temple seats 900 people. The architectural work was selected for the 2012 Venice Biennale and was featured in that year's arts and architecture catalog.  Religious life  Congregation Amijai is dedicated to the study of Torah. It respects the dietary laws of kashrut. As a conservative synagogue, religious life is egalitarian. Women count toward a minyan, can read Torah during religious services, wear a Kippah, a Tallit and/or Tefillin. The synagogue also considers Organ donation to be a Mitzvah. The congregation believes \\"in a Judaism far from bourgeois comfort, ignorance, individualism, compulsion and fear.\\" The synagogue gives back charitably to the community, with monthly tzedakah collections, collaboration with the local non-profit Sonrisas in the town of Esteban Echeverr√≠a, a community dining room/soup kitchen for homeless and low income residents and winter clothing drives. The Congregation supports the Argentine Ecumenical Movement and participates in the National Plan for Cultural Equality. In 2014 Congregation Amijai's Rabbi Alejandro Avruj joined Pope Francis as part of the interfaith delegation of the Pope's visit to the Middle East. Rabbi Avruj worked alongside the Pontiff on social justice related issues when the latter was Archbishop of Buenos Aires and thus was invited to participate as part of the delegation.Alejandro Avruj, Rabino de la Comunidad Amijai y de estrecho v√≠nculo con el papa Francisco, detall√≥ en Radio Jai c√≥mo ser√° el itinerario en el cual acompa√±ar√° a Jorge Bergoglio en su recorrido por Israel  Arts and culture  √Årbol de la vida de Clorindo Testa During the construction of the building, a design contest was held for a Tree of life art piece in the temple garden to honor the memory of congregants' loved ones.

Techniques=Acid maceration Acid maceration is a technique to extract organic microfossils from a surrounding rock matrix using acid. Hydrochloric acid or acetic acid may be used to extract phosphatic fossils, such as the small shelly fossils, from a carbonate matrix. Hydrofluoric acid is also used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks. Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it. Film pull The film pull technique is a means of recovering carbonaceous compression fossils for study under transmitted light microscopy. An acid is applied to the surface of the rock to etch away the matrix from the surface, leaving carbonaceous tissue protruding. (Surfaces not to be etched can be coated in a wax (e.g. Vaseline or grease). This is usually accomplished by placing the rock upside-down in a weak, continually stirred acid, so that any debris can be washed away. Nitrocellulose is then painted on to the fossil-bearing surface, and once dry may be peeled from the rock, or the rock dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. The method was pioneered by John Walton in 1928 as a method to derive serial thin-sections without the time, expense and lost material incurred by dissolving the rock. An improvement on the method, using gelatine (with glycerin and formalin) instead of cellulose, was reported in 1930, and is especially suitable for larger samples. This solution-based method was largely superseded by the use of pre-formed sheets of film, similar to those used in overhead transparencies; cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate can be used, although the latter is preferable. By wetting the reverse surface of the film with acetate, the film becomes more labile and makes a better contact with the material. The peel can be washed in acid to remove any remaining matrix before mounting onto a slide with resin for further study. The method is somewhat destructive, as the acid etching used to remove the rock matrix can also destroy some finer detail; the fizzing caused by the reaction of the acid with the matrix breaks up less-robust cellular material. A second peel without further etching, a \\"rip peel\\", will remove any cell walls that are parallel to the surface, and would otherwise be destroyed when subjected to acid. Details of the modern application of the method can be found in reference (). Even the latest technique does have some disadvantages; most notably, smaller fossils that may lie between cell walls will be washed away with the acid etch, and can only be recovered by a thin section preparation. In order to mount the slides for microscopy, a series of steps are necessary: * A glass slide is wetted with acetone, and a fresh layer of acetate is placed upon it. The acetone allows the acetate to 'suck' itself onto the slide, maintaining a good contact by suction. This will later be dissolved, allowing sections of the resin-mounted peel to be cut for transmission electron microscopy. * A thin layer of epoxy resin is applied, covering the acetate and spreading onto the slide. This will serve to attach the preparation to the slide once the underlying acetate has been dissolved. * A glass plate is greased, and the smooth side of a peel pressed down onto it. * The rough side of this peel is covered with warmed (55 ¬∞C) epoxy resin, and pressed down onto the previously-prepared slide. After about 45 minutes the glass plate is removed, and the resin is left, warm, to cure. * The preparation is washed in acetone and acid to remove any residues, which would otherwise produce optical artefacts when imaged. Specimens recovered by film pull are prone to wrinkling, especially if the surface to be peeled is not perfectly smoothed‚Äîif acetone pools, it can cause the acetate to wrinkle. Transfer technique The holotype of Darwinius, showing the result of transfer technique. The amber matrix is two-component epoxy. The transfer technique is a technique to stabilise and prepare fossils by partially embedding them in plastic resins (i.e. epoxy or polyester) in order to preserve the position of the preserved fossil once all of the rock matrix is subsequently removed. Notable examples of this technique are fossils preserved in oil shale (such as those from the Messel Pit) or other substrates that will deteriorate under atmospheric conditions, or fossils preserved in acid-soluble carbonates (such as fossils from the Santana Formation).Maisey, J.G., Rutzky, I., Blum, S. & W. Elvers (1991): Laboratory Preparation Techniques. In Maisey, j:G. (ed): Santana Fossils: An Illustrated Atlas, Tfh Pubns Inc.. pp 99‚Äì103. The technique is notable for delivering exquisite preparations of both very high scientific and display value, as the area exposed in this method is protected by the matrix prior to the preparation, while the initially exposed fossils are often subject to damage from improper mechanical removal of sediment or where the plane of splitting has extended through the fossil. This allows the potential to preserve microscopic details on the surface of the fossil. The method was pioneered by Harry Toombs and A.E. Rixon of the British Museum in 1950 with the introduction of the technique as a means of extracting fish fossils from acid-soluble carbonates. The technique permitted the preparation of delicate, fragmented, or otherwise unstable fossils by the removal of virtually all of the surrounding rock matrix. The resulting preparation retains the position of all of the parts of the fossil in the position in which they were preserved in the fossil. While the method developed by Toombs and Rixon calls for plastic resins, other substances, such as a mix of ground chalk and beeswax have been used. Oil shale from Messel, cracking up as it dries. While the original method was developed to deal with fossils freed from the matrix by acid, its most well known application is to the fossils from The Messel pit. These fossils, noted for their exquisite preservation, including soft tissue, body outline and even colour sheen on beetle wings, are notoriously difficult to preserve. The fossils themselves are flat, sometimes film-like on the surface of the rock layers. The oil shale contains 40% water. When a slab is broken free of surrounding rock, it will soon dry out and crack.Messel Oil Shale Fossil Site Lagerstatte, Virtual fossil museum website A slab with a perfect fossil will turn to a heap of rubble in a few hours, destroying the fossil with it. This was the fate of numerous Messel fossils until the transfer technique was started to be applied in the 1970s. In order to preserve the fossils once their slab is taken out of the rock, the fossil need to be transferred from the rock surface on to a durable, artificial surface. The water in the fossil itself also needs to be replaced. As soon as the slab bearing the fossil is worked free from the rock, it is submerged in water to stop it from cracking. This involves packing it in plastic and sometimes wet newspaper. While in the wet state, it is cleaned up and all preparation needed for the transfer conducted.Messel Research Station, Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum website Once ready for transfer, the fossil (but not the surrounding rock) is dried off with a blow- dryer. As soon as the fossil starts to lighten (a sign of drying), water- soluble lacquer is applied. The lacquer will penetrate the bone and other organic remains, but not the shale itself, as shale is impenetrable to watery solutions. When the lacquer has set, a frame of modelling clay is built on the rock face around the fossil. A two-component epoxy is poured onto the frame, forming the new artificial surface for the fossil. The composition of the resin is important, as it will have to soak into the fossil to further strengthen it and to bind it to the new surface. This can be controlled by varying the resin viscosity. When the epoxy has set, the slab is turned over, and preparation begins from the shale at the back. Layer by layer of oil-shale is removed with brush and scalpel. When the preparator hits the fossil, more lacquer and glue is applied to further stabilize the fragile fossil. When the work is done, all traces of oil-shale have been removed, only the fossil itself remains on the epoxy slab.Messel Fossils from Germany website The contrasting physical property of the rock and fossil are essential for this technique to succeed. The organic remains of the fossil are porous and hygroscopic, while the oil-containing rock is not. Thus, the lacquer can penetrate fossils, and not rock, enabling the preparator to ‚Äúglue‚Äù the fossil to the artificial slab, without at the same time gluing it to the shale.

He composed the songs between 1837 and 1843, setting six poems in German. They are subtitled \\"Im Freien zu singen\\" (\\"To be sung outdoors\\"), and focus on nature. They were published after his death as part of his complete works. One of the songs, \\"O T√§ler weit, o H√∂hen\\" became so popular that it is also regarded as Volkslied.  History  When Mendelssohn studied in Berlin with Carl Friedrich Zelter, he was introduced to the lieder of Zelter, Ludwig Berger, Johann Friedrich Reichardt and Bernhard Klein,who have become known to musicologiats as the Zweite Berliner Liederschule (\\"Second Berlin Song School\\"). Their concepts included simple strophic form and singable melodies, trying to convey the characteristic moods of the poems which they set. Mendelssohn followed these ideas, which were also promoted by Goethe, in his songs. Mendelssohn composed his songs for four mixed voices during the summer months which he spent with his family in Frankfurt or on his uncle's winery in Horchheim. He composed three sets \\"lm Freien zu singen\\" of six songs each, Op. 41 in 1834, Op. 48 in 1839, and Op. 59 in 1837 to 1843. Ten further songs were published as Op. 88 and Op. 100. All appeared as part of his complete works by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1882‚Äì84. The third of the songs, Abschied vom Walde (Farewell to the Forest), beginning \\"O T√§ler weit, o H√∂hen\\" (O valleys wide, o height) became especially popular, and has been regarded as a Volkslied.  Structure  The titles of the six songs, Op. 59 are: # Im Gr√ºnen (in the Green) # Fr√ºhzeitiger Fr√ºhling (Early Spring) # Abschied vom Walde (Farewell to the forest) # Die Nachtigall (The nightingale) # Ruhetal (Restful valley) # Jagdlied (Chase song) The poems were written by Helmina von Ch√©zy (1), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (2, 4), Joseph von Eichendorff (3, 6), and Ludwig Uhland (5), treated with freedom at times. Their themes are often Spring and Nature. Mendelssohn expanded some songs by a coda, others are through-composed. No. 3, \\"Abschied vom Walde\\", is in simple strophic form but uses imitation of the voices in the third line.  Recordings  In 2010, the title Abschied vom Walde of the third song, was taken for a recording of part-songs by Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny Hensel, performed by the Vocal Concert Dresden. All Mendelssohn's songs Im Freien zu singen were recorded in 2017 by the Kammerchor Stuttgart, conducted by Frieder Bernius, awarded the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik.

He was also a nephew of Toussaint Louverture. In 1796, he married Sanite Belair.  Haitian Revolution  From December 25, 1791, a few months after the events of August 22, he was found signing with his commander Biassou a letter of high political significance addressed to the abee de Lahaye.In the summer of 1794, he spent with Toussaint in the service of France. With the organization of the troops in demi-brigades in the spring of 1795, he was integrated into a battalion of the 7th before becoming Colonel to replace Desrouleaux. During the war in the South, which he waged without excess of zeal, he remained in this post until the campaign in the East. Finally promoted brigadier general in January 1801, after the campaign which earned him distinctions, he retained command of Arcahaie until the landing of Leclerc's expeditionary forces in the West in February 1802 as General Boudet's troops approached, he set fire to the square before withdrawing with funds from the public treasury and part of the population in Les Matheux. After the fall of Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot at the end of March, Belair abandoned the region to fall back to the Cahos where he was to swell the staff of the former governor. At the time of his submission, on May 6, Toussaint Louverture obtained from Captain General Leclerc pardon for three of his generals: Dessalines, Vernet and Belair. Transferred on May 26 from his post of commander of Arcahaie to Verrettes where he will settle on one of his properties. Henry Christophe and Him fought in Savannah, Georgia for the cause of the independence of the United States, covered himself with glory during the Southern War.  Capture and execution  The news of the arrest followed by the deportation of Toussaint on June 11 will plunge back into rebellion. He now has Dessalines in front of him, whom he accuses of having betrayed Toussaint, his benefactor. Having first obtained some success, occupying the heights of Artibonite with part of the colonial troops who had been in the pay of General Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc and had passed with the insurgents, Leclerc sent Dessalines against him, as much to compromise the one here vis-√†-vis the Haitians, than to spare its own troops. After the deportation of Toussaint Louverture, he immediately went to Arcahaie and raised the banner of revolt on August 22, 1802. To force him to surrender, they used disloyal means by imprisoning his family. Learning of the arrest of his wife and mother, B√©lair left his hiding place; he was arrested and delivered to Leclerc. The latter formed a commission to judge him, made up of General Dugua, president, brigadier generals Clerveaux, Duverseau. Charles B√©lair was condemned to the gallows and, on October 15, 1802, He died by firing squad and his wife Sanite was decapitated.

Settled by a family of formerly enslaved African Americans from Fauquier County, Virginia, Pleasant Ridge was a rural community with a significant population of formerly enslaved people and their descendants. The community declined in the 20th century, and the last resident died in 1959. History In 1848, Charles Shepard and his family were released from slavery when their former enslaver, Sarah Edmonds of Fauquier County, Virginia, died and freed them in her will. Charles; his wife, Caroline; his three children Harriet, John, and Mary; his brother Isaac; and his future sister-in-law, Sarah Brown, traveled to Wisconsin with Edmonds's nephew William Horner, who hoped to make his fortune in southwestern Wisconsin's lead mining industry. When he arrived, he discovered that the state's lead industry was in decline, and he instead purchased between 1,000 and 3,000 acres of farmland in Grant County. The Shepards worked for Horner for several years before acquiring enough money to purchase 200 acres of land from him for $1.50 per acre, laying the groundwork for the Pleasant Ridge community. In the 1850s, African Americans fleeing enslavement in Tennessee, Missouri, and Arkansas settled near the Shepards' land. Many men from Pleasant Ridge served in the American Civil War, beginning in 1863 when the Union Army allowed African American men to serve as soldiers. Charles Shepard enlisted and died at the Siege of Vicksburg. His son, John, also served in the Union Army, and died of disease toward the end of the war while he was returning to Wisconsin. At least eight African-American veterans of the Civil War returned to Pleasant Ridge after their service and some became farm owners. The United Brethren Church at the Old World Wisconsin open-air museum in Eagle, Wisconsin. In the years following the Civil War, more African Americans arrived in Pleasant Ridge. Some White families moved to the area as well. The community's population peaked at between 100 and 200 residents, split fairly evenly between Black and White families. In 1873, the residents built Grant County District School #5, an early integrated public school that employed both Black and White teachers. The community established a cemetery in 1883, the United Brethren Church in 1884, and a community hall in 1898. In 1906 the women of Pleasant Ridge formed the Autumn Leaf Society, a philanthropic group that organized community dances and celebrations, including an annual barbecue each August. In 1895, Pleasant Ridge's African American residents owned nearly 700 acres of farmland, but in the 20th century the population began to decline. The community's small size and rural setting meant that residents had limited economic opportunities. Many younger residents moved to pursue education and careers in larger cities and other states. Ollie Green Lewis, a descendant of the Shepard family and the last African-American resident, died at Pleasant Ridge in February 1959. In the 21st century, only the Pleasant Ridge Cemetery remains at the site with a historical marker erected by the Wisconsin chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1994. The United Brethren Church building is preserved in the African-American section of the Old World Wisconsin open-air museum in Eagle, Wisconsin.

Further reports of the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) and the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) raised the question of classification of these events as crimes against humanity. On 1 September 2020, in a statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office, more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees were mentioned, including sexual abuse and rape. Background On 9 August 2020, in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 Belarusian presidential elections, which were considered by the Belarusian opposition to be falsified, massive gatherings of protesters started to be forming in Minsk and other major cities of Belarus. In the following night, the initially peaceful protests turned into a full-scale confrontation between the protesters and the Belarusian security forces, during which more than 3,000 protestors were arrested. The open confrontation continued through the next two days, which led to a total of around 7,000 arrested protestors. On 12 August 2020, the open confrontation stopped, and peaceful protests resumed. Accounts of victims and witnesses According to Maxim Solopov, special correspondent of Meduza, who was detained during the 10 August protest and spent two days at the Okrestina detention centre, the detainees were ordered to kneel with their hands behind their heads and put their heads on the ground; then, they were continuously beaten by the staff for hours before being put into the cells. The male detainees were ordered to completely undress while laying on the ground, and, on several occasions, loud explosions were heard by Solopov; he believed these could have been detonations of flash- bang grenades. According to Solopov, the tile floor in the detention centre was completely covered with blood, and screams of the beaten detainees could be heard during all his stay there. Solopov also reported that the cell where he and other detainees stayed (45 people in total) had an area of approximately 8 square meters and lacked proper ventilation. On one occasion, 35 female detainees from the cell next to Solopov's, after they screamed to the staff they were suffocating, had dirty water (left from washing the floor) poured over them and threatened that feces would be thrown over them if the screaming did not stop. According to a Tut.by publication citing various police violence victims and witnesses, the detainees were repeatedly beaten and humiliated by the police and, on many occasions, were refused medical help even if they had open wounds and traumatic brain injuries. Victims reported that detainees were ordered to do squats and had their legs beaten if they failed to fully comply with the order. One of the detainees had a flash-bang grenade put in his underwear, and the police officers who did it threatened him to pull the safety pin and make it look as if the man died from the detonation of a self-made explosive device, mentioning that they \\"will not have to answer for that\\". According to a witness, a person suffering from an asthma attack had a foot put on his throat and threatened to be killed without any negative consequences for the police officers involved. The detainees' smartphones were taken by the police officers, and if the detainees refused to tell the unlocking password, they were severely beaten up until they gave the password. According to a witness, a male detainee was undressed by the police and threatened to be sodomized with a nightstick if he refused to give the unlocking password. Female detainees who attempted to help others by telling the police officers about the grave condition of their inmates were brutally dragged by their hair, had their hair cut, and were threatened to be gang- raped should they persist. Other victims reported that the detainees were repeatedly tortured with tear gas and electrocution and, on some occasions, were used as a furniture while standing on their knees, with their heads on the ground. In a Tut.by interview with the hospitalized police violence victims, it was reported that some of them had been beaten by eight to ten fully equipped police officers at once, while being ordered to lay down and keep their hands behind their heads. Such beatings could last for hours and were accompanied by humiliating acts such as cutting the detainees' hair and ordering them to eat it. The beaten detainees were constantly asked by the police officers who their coordinators were and who had paid them to attend the protest. Some detainees had their underwear torn apart and had truncheons put closely to their rectal area while being beaten and receiving rape threats. According to one of the former detainees, he was beaten to a point where he could not react to the reality anymore and, after it was noticed by the police officers, he was thrown on the concrete floor and repeatedly spilled with cold water, after which he lost consciousness and woke up in a hospital. The former detainees report they were ordered to say they loved OMON () and were forced to sing the state anthem of Belarus, while the female detainees were constantly threatened with rape. According to one of the former detainees, a detained female medical volunteer was not beaten but was repeatedly insulted by the police officers until she started crying. If \\"suspicious\\" items (such as medical gloves, respirators, knives of any size or even barrettes) were found in the detainees' personal belongings, they were beaten even harder, as they were considered by the police to be the \\"organizers\\" and \\"coordinators\\" of the protest. According to witness' reports, some people arriving at the detention centre showed signs of severe rubber bullet wounds on their heads and necks and had to be quickly transported to the military hospital or, if their condition was critical, to the closest civilian hospital. Meanwhile, some of the OMON officers present there were beating even the severely wounded detainees, while screaming and threatening the doctors who tried to help them. On several occasions, doctors were refused their requests to release the detainees in grave condition. According to one of the former detainees, when he was released from a detention centre and sent to a hospital, the ambulance that transported him had its tires perforated by unknown men in cars with tinted glass. According to a Tut.by publication citing an anonymous medical worker of the Minsk military hospital, about 60 patients with gunshot wounds were brought to the hospital on 9 and 10 August, several of them requiring assisted ventilation. One of the patients, a 60-year-old man, related that as he was walking through a crowd of protesters, the police arrived and the crowd started to disperse; as he could not run due to his age, he decided to surrender and raised his arms up. Shortly after that, he received a point-blank shot in his torso. The youngest of the hospitalized detainees was a 16-year-old boy in critical condition: the riot police had thrown an unidentified explosive device under his feet, rendering one of his thighs completely shattered. According to the medical worker, many of the patients brought to the military hospital had severe torso and chest penetrating traumas. According to a Naviny.by journalist, Alyona Shcherbinskaya, who was detained on 10 August and spent three days at the Okrestina detention centre, the female detainees were subjected there to repeated beating and humiliation by the female staff. Shcherbinskaya reports that a staff member by the name Kristina was among the most vicious ones there: she constantly insulted the detained women, forced them to bend forward and punched them in the stomach, forced them do squats naked and, at some point, \\"took insoles out of detainees' boots\\". The female detainees experiencing menstruation were ordered by her to throw away their sanitary napkins, which was justified by the \\"need to make sure there was nothing forbidden underneath\\". One of the detained women tore apart her coat and gave the cloth pieces to the inmates in need of a sanitary napkin replacement. However, the pieces didn't last for long and soon had to be replaced with toilet paper, which they ran out of shortly afterwards. According to Shcherbinskaya, the female detainees were taken out of their cells a few times per day and were forced to stay in line along the wall with their legs widely spread, and if the legs weren't considered to be spread wide enough by the staff, the women were punched in the groin area, including the ones on their period, which caused their sanitary napkin replacements to fall off. At the time of Shcherbinskaya's trial, which happened right in the detention centre, she was viciously beat up by Kristina after refusing to sign a falsified detention protocol. Also, Shcherbitskaya recalls that at some point she was taken to a corridor with naked men on their knees, foreheads on the wall and their hands tied behind their backs. The corridor was covered with blood, the male detainees were groaning, and the staff were screaming very loudly. In an interview to Naviny.by, a former Okrestina detainee reported that at some point an extremely violent beating of a woman was heard through a whole night. According to him, some people were dying inside the cells after the violent beatings, while all requests for medical help from their inmates were getting ignored by the Okrestina staff. On rare occasions, when medics were allowed to examine the suffering detainees and asked for permission to transport them to hospitals, they were refused to do so by OMON officers, who said \\"Let them die\\". The same applied to the people with diabetes. On several occasions, the detainees' smartphones were taken away and smashed into their heads. The detainees who refused to provide the unlocking passwords, were tortured by tear gas and had their fingers broken until the password was given. According to the former detainee, around 124 people were kept in a 30 square meters cell, which forced them to stay for up to 24 hours, while they were refused any water for 15 hours. He also noted that no inventorization was carried out during detainees' acceptance to the detention centre, which means their personal belongings, including money, could have been stolen. Some detainees were noticed to walk out of Okrestina without their shoes. According to the staff of the Minsk Clinical Emergency Hospital, most of the hospitalized protesters suffered from gunshot wounds and blast injuries, with the most severe cases involving amputations of the traumatized limbs. The detainees transported to the hospital from the Okrestina detention centre were diagnosed with closed-head injuries, concussions, and severe head and torso bruises. In some cases, severe arm fractures were registered, which, according to the medics, \\"looked as if they had been made on purpose\\". Some of the hospitalized male detainees were diagnosed with rectal fractures. On 11 August, Artyom Vazhenkov and Igor Rogov, members of the Open Russia organization who had come to Minsk to monitor the election, were detained by the police and brought to the Okrestina detention centre. In his interview to Radio Free Europe, entitled \\"We are re-educating you scum!\\", Vazhenkov related the numerous abuses to which he and the other detainees, some of them underage, were subjected by the detention centre's staff. Vazhenkov reported that each time the detainees asked for food or water or said they needed to go to the bathroom, they were met with verbal and physical aggression on the part of the centre's staff. The detainees were humiliated by being forced to undress to their underwear and stay in this condition both in the cell and during the trials, which were performed directly at the detention centre. According to one of the former Okrestina detainees, shortly after the detention, people had their clothes cut (including, in some cases, the underwear) and were numerically marked with a marker pen by the police, after which they were only referenced to by their assigned numbers. Some of the police officers involved made drawings on the detainees' bodies. In a Current Time TV video, entitled \\"They Treated Me Like An Animal\\", several released Belarusian detainees provided personal accounts of police abuse, which involved gang-rape and kill threats, severe beatings, tortures with cold water, food and water denial for more than 48 hours and forcing to sign a detention protocol under threats of torture. According to a 16-years-old former detainee, who had to be hospitalized in a state of induced coma after he was severely beaten and tortured by electrocution, the detainees were ordered to sing the anthem of OMON and, if they refused, they had truncheon hammered in their throats, and, on one occasion, a detainee was anally raped with a truncheon. A former detainee who was initially transported to the Savyetski District RUVD () reported that around 80 people were lined along a wall there and were forced to stay for 24 hours with their hands behind their heads, including the ones with broken hands, who were refused medical attention. According to him, the detainees were beaten there and threatened by police officers with execution by shooting, which they claimed they had direct orders to perform, and were allowed to sit only during a night for a total of 15 minutes. According to another former detainee who was initially transported to the Partyzanski District RUVD, the detainees there (around 30 in total) were severely beaten, taken to a basement and ordered to sing the anthem of Belarus on multiple occasions. A female former detainee who was transported to the Maskowski District RUVD reported that during the early stages of detention she was repeatedly beaten, accused of being a \\"protest coordinator\\" and demanded to name the people who paid her. In the RUVD, she was taken to a hall where the floor was covered with blood and vomit, was ordered to lay down and threatened to have her dreadlocks cut off. During interrogation by 7 police officers, she was demanded to tell who paid her for the subversion and at some point was knocked out of a chair, ordered to lay down and was beaten with truncheons each time her answers weren't considered satisfactory. After the interrogation, she was taken to a hall with about 40 or more detainees and had her clothes marked with an aerosol paint, which, as she learned later, was a message to other police officers meaning she was one of the most active protesters. At the Okrestina detention centre, she, along with other 35‚Äì40 women, was put in a four-people cell where she spent another 3 days. Another female former detainee reported that at some point she was taken to a six- people cell with 50 other detainees who were refused food and had no access to clean water. During her last night there, the Okrestina staff knocked on the cell door once in an hour, preventing the detainees from sleeping. The detainees there were nearly suffocating and restrained from talking in order to preserve as much oxygen as possible. When she was transported to a detention centre in Zhodzina, she received food for the first time in three days and heard local staff referring to Okrestina as Auschwitz concentration camp. Another female former detainee from Okrestina, who was arrested by 10 OMON officers as an independent observer during the elections and was put in a four-people cell with 35 other women, reported that all the detainees' requests for more air were met with an opened door and a splash of water. The detainees there were constantly humiliated and refused means of personal hygiene, such as sanitary napkins. During the night, when male detainees were taken out of their cells, she heard sounds of severe beatings and screams, and, in the morning, saw the corridor walls of the Okrestina covered with blood. Sergei Dylevsky, a steel worker at the Minsk Tractor Works who helped take protesters released from detention to a hospital, recalled that one of them had lost an eye after being beaten at the facility. This evidence angered Dylevsky and led to his joining the Coordination Council. On 11 August, Karina Malinovskaya from Grodno was detained by plainclothes men near her home and taken to the Grodno's Leninsky District RUVD where she was hard punched in the stomach while being pregnant. Despite informing the RUVD staff about her condition and the emergence of a stomach pain, she was initially denied medical help and was threatened to be beaten and have her other child taken away by the government in case she didn't comply with the police' orders. After about three hours, she was checked by the RUVD medical personnel who doubted the fact of her pregnancy and called an emergency only after Malinovskaya reminded them of their legal liability. At the city hospital, her pregnancy was confirmed, and the medical staff there insisted on immediate hospitalization, which the escorting police officers considered to be possible only with Malinovskaya being handcuffed to a bed. Presented with an alternative option of being set free in the morning after being transported to a local detention center and going through her trial, Malinovskaya agreed on a condition that she would not be beaten again. At the detention center, Malinovskaya was not beaten, but was brought to a mass beating of men, which she was forced to watch by the center's staff informed of her condition. After some time of this torture, which Malinovskaya compared to \\"something from a movie about the Gestapo\\", her body started to severely tremor, which frightened the guards and made them call an emergency. In a hospital, Malinovskaya was diagnosed with a cyst rupture and underwent a surgery, which eventually resulted in a pregnancy loss. In the aftermath, Malinvoskaya was contacted by the RUVD and demanded to sign a detention protocol describing her as \\"swearing, screaming and attacking people\\", which she refused. Eventually, she was sentenced to an administrative fee for participation in a \\"chain of solidarity\\" on 14 August. Violations of arrest and court procedures=Arrest procedure violations Arrests of the protesters were often conducted by people wearing masks or balaclavas and without IDs, with some of them wearing civilian clothes and bulletproof vests. Agents in civilian clothes, unofficially called \\"the quiet men\\" ( ‚Äî tikhari), not only arrested protesters in collaboration with the government troops, but also beat people, made operational video shooting and testified in courts. Their affiliation was often impossible to establish. \\" The employment of plainclothes police was admitted by the minister of internal affairs, Yury Karaev., while, according to Belarusian human rights activists, the only possible legal justification for such measures was special investigation activity. They also note that the OSCE guidance document on mass political meetings requires policemen to be easily identifiable. Numerous reports of arrests without introducing (name, rank, institution of the officer) and explanation of reasons of arrest were reported, despite the direct demand of the Belarusian law. Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that all such cases were justified by the \\"urgent needs\\". Arrest of Maria Kalesnikava was sometimes compared with abduction. Forced checks of passer-by's mobile phones were widely practiced without the prosecutor's or court orders. If the police officers or troops found photos from the protest rallies or subscription to anti-Lukashenko Telegram channels, the inspected person could be detained and/or beaten. Some non-protesters, including passers-by, bicyclists, journalists and election observers, were detained at the polling stations. Court procedure violations Many people detained in the first days after the election stated that their trials were extremely simplified and short, often being conducted right at the detention center. Some detained people were forced by the police officers with batons to kneel in front of judges and not to look at them. In some cases, names of the judges weren't announced, and the judgment was read out without the judge. Many trials were held behind closed doors. Police reports (protocols) were often reported to be full of mistakes, including confusion of names, places and circumstances, but the objections about these mistakes were seldom taken into consideration by the judges. It was reported that those who didn't agree with the police reports and refused to sign them could be beaten. An election observer who was detained at the polling station, was convicted on the basis of the report claiming that 2 hours after the detention she was shouting anti- government slogans in another place in Minsk. A detained Russian tourist was successively charged for protesting in two different parts of Minsk at the same time. At least three similar cases involving journalists were known: they were first charged on the basis of one police report, but after they argued that they were in another place at the stated time of detention, they were charged and convicted on the basis of another report. A woman in Minsk was found guilty with a social network photo acting as the only evidence. Prosecution witnesses, if any, testified remotely (via video communication services), anonymously or with changed names, and their faces were sometimes covered with mask or balaclavas. One of the charged journalists claimed that the witness who testified against him was given hints by a man nearby. In September, minister of internal affairs, Yury Karaev, offered the Belarusian parliament to legalize such practice in order to increase the security of the policemen. Defense lawyers reported obstruction by the government officials and violation of their rights, including intentional concealment of their clients' location and unannounced beginnings of trials. On 11 September, a judge of Zavodski District in Minsk, Zhanna Khvoinistskaya, stated in a judgment that having a contract with a lawyer was the evidence of guilt. Internal and international reactions * On 14 August, Alexander Barsukov, the deputy minister of Internal Affairs, denied the employment of torture by the security forces. On 16 August, Yuri Karaev, the Minister of Internal Affairs, stated that all cases of abuse of authority were going to be investigated after the stabilization of the situation in the country. On 17 August, Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, admitted some of the Okrestina detainees were beaten, but noted that those were only the ones who attempted to attack the Okrestina staff. * On 20 August, Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, issued a statement condemning the violence used against peaceful protesters and abuse of the detainees. * In a 21 August statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, it was noted that, despite the majority of the detainees being released, serious concerns about the missing protestors and the ones accused of criminal acts were still there. The statement underlined the lack of information about the detainees' status and called for immediate release of the unlawfully detained persons.

It is the oldest continuously operating synagogue in the Russian Far East. The synagogue is located in the historic district of Vladivostok, on Praporchik Komarov St. For 70 years, the synagogue building was property of the Soviet authorities, but in 2005, the building was returned to the Jewish community and restored. It was rededicated as \\"Bet Sima\\".  History  Until the 1917 February Revolution, Russian Jews had the ability (outside of the Pale of Settlement) to rent a building for use as a synagogue, without the right to own it. In 1911, the Jewish community of Vladivostok was abouit 160 men, and had a synagogue located at 19 Komarovska Street (Today 5 Praporchik Komarov Street). It was L√©onti (Le√Øb) Sem√Øonovitch (Chimanovitch) Skidelski (1845‚Äî1916) who built what is now Bet Sima Synagogue. He was a trader with the first guild, an honorary citizen of Vladivostok, sponsor of the Society of Study of the Amur Region and a patron of industry in Ussuri krai. On October 5, 1916, three days before his death, Skidelski laid the first stone for the \\"Synagogue of the Jewish Community of Vladivostok\\" (the name used at the time) near the previous location of the community. The construction was funded by private donations. At the time, Jews often had to ask permission to build a private building and then ask permission to use it as a house of prayer. By 1917, Judaism was legalized in Russia and the existing synagogue was allowed to operate as a place of worship, owned by the Jewish community. At the end of 1932 the synagogue was closed by Soviet authorities, the Jewish community was dissolved by law. The synagogue building was given to Vladivostok Confectionary Factory in 1933, first as a club and later as the store for the factory. The factory had the building until the early 1990s. In 1996, the building was declared an architectural monument of regional value.D√©cision du Kra√Ø de Primori√©/ –ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –î—É–º—ã –ü—Ä–∏–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä–∞—è ‚Ññ 314 –æ—Ç 27 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 1996 –≥–æ–¥–∞  Renaissance  On September 8, 2004 Sergei Darkine, Governor of Primorsky Krai, presented Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar with the legal documents giving the rights to use the building for free in perpetuity. The Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia later transferred that right to the local Jewish community in 2005. In February 2013 Shimon Varakin, Rabbi of Primorsky Krai and Vladivostok announced plans to renovate the synagogue based on new plans. The Jewish community in Vladivostok, which numbered about 300 at the time, received support from a businessman in Moscow for the project. In autumn 2013, the renovations began, finishing in June 2014. The re-dedication of the synagogue took place on December 18, 2015. The synagogue was renamed \\"Bet Sima\\" in honor of the mother of banker Vladimir Kogan, Seraphime (Sima) Kogan.

The wings had wooden structures and were ply-covered around the leading edges and on the undersides. Their covering was completed with fabric over all surfaces. Interplane struts were metal and the fabric- covered ailerons, fitted on both upper and lower wings, had metal structures. The fuselage was a fabric-covered steel tube structure. The engine mountings accepted several versions of the ADC Cirrus engine, the Cirrus II, Cirrus III or Cirrus Hermes. Instructor and pupil had separate open cockpits in tandem, equipped with dual controls. Its conventional landing gear was also steel, with oleo-rubber landing legs. Operational history Only two R-3 are known to have flown but one made an extended tour of Europe in the late summer of 1932, piloted by two Japanese university students supported by the Japan Aeronautical League of Students. For this tour extra tankage increased the R-3's endurance from about 3.5 hrs to 10.5 hrs.

Founded by Rabbi Yisroel Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim) in 1924, it was led by Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski.  History  Grodno in the early 20th century The organization was introduced at a meeting of rabbis in Grodno that had been organized by Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski in 1924. Rabbi Grodzinski was appointed head of the organization, which was based in Vilna, and remained active at this post for the rest of his life. Its goal was to help finance the yeshivos in Lithuania and Poland (most of which would currently be in Belarus), as well as provide for needy students and represent the interests of the yeshivos. During World War II, a major issue arose. Escaping the Communist Soviets that had taken over eastern Poland, many yeshivos traveled to Vilna, which would come under the Republic of Lithuania's government. However, in the center of World War II, the Vaad HaYeshivos understood that the war would soon reach Lithuania and the yeshiva students had to escape Europe. They, therefore, arranged Polish passports and visas to the West Indies and Japan for all the students, planning for the students to leave Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. For many, these efforts were for naught, as train tickets cost an exorbitant amount of money. While many refugees, including the Mir Yeshiva, got the money for tickets and were saved from the Holocaust, most of the students were forced to remain in Lithuania.

Biography Mashkoor Hussain Yaad was born in 1925, in Dabwali, Hisar of East Punjab (now part of Haryana). He went by the pen name \\"Yaad\\", and later added this to his name when he became a poet. At a young age, his family moved to Muzaffarnagar District in Uttar Pradesh, where his father became a police officer. He was married first in 1943. Two weeks after Partition in 1947, his house was attacked and 35 of his family members were killed, including his wife and his three-year-old daughter. Only Yaad and his father survived the attack, and both migrated to Multan, Pakistan. Yaad died in 2017 at the age of 90. On the occasion of his death, Shehbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Punjab at the time, publicly expressed his condolences and said that Yaad's contribution to Urdu literature will be remembered for a long time.  Literary career  Just before he graduated from school, Yaad became editor of the newspaper Pukar. In his capacity as editor, Yaad was able to closely observe India's independence movement and the Pakistan movement. He also met and interviewed leaders of these movements, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru. In Pakistan, his literary career was re-launched after he became Professor of Urdu at Government College, Lahore and published Azadi Ki Chiragh. Though not a member of Pakistan's Progressive Writers Association, he was friends with many of its members, especially Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi. Qasmi and Yaad even lived in the same neighborhood in Lahore, Samanabad's Zafar Colony, along with the poet and lyricist Qateel Shifai, also a close friend.

Youth C√¥t√© was born in Edmonton, Alberta to French-Canadian parents. His parents were Senator Jean C√¥t√© and C√©cile C√¥t√© (n√©e Gagnon). C√¥t√©'s father was a government land surveyor from Quebec who went west in 1903 to determine the frontier between Alaska and the Yukon, and he subsequently became active as a mining engineer in Alberta. C√¥t√©'s mother came from a wealthy Quebec City family who was a great patron of music. C√¥t√© was educated at Edmonton's Jesuit College and one friend recalled: \\"His French was impeccable ‚Äî just as one would expect of someone who studied with the Jesuits\\". In 1931, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science at Universit√© Laval. After graduation, C√¥t√© worked as a civil servant for the Alberta government and became involved in the Association canadienne-fran√ßaise de l‚ÄôAlberta group that campaigned to preserve French in Alberta. C√¥t√© also worked as a radio announcer for Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and served as the bilingual host on a radio show that played classical music every week. Starting in 1935, he attended the University of Alberta where he was awarded a LL.B. in 1938 and in 1939 joined the Law Society of Alberta. C√¥t√© was always proud to be both a westerner and a French-Canadian. As a member of a minority, C√¥t√© defined his sense of Canadian nationalism in civic terms instead of ethnic terms. C√¥t√© chose as his motto: \\"Faire ce qui doit etre fait\\" (\\"do what must be done\\"). Second World War  In 1939, he joined the Royal 22e R√©giment, better known as the Van Doos, as a lieutenant. On 8 December 1939, he sailed as a part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division that left Quebec City for Great Britain. C√¥t√©'s first duty in Britain was to prepare the lavish Christmas feast for the Van Doos, who wanted to feel as if they were still at home. In early 1940, Marshal Maurice Gamelin the commander of the French Army, visited Britain and wanted to see the famous Royal 22e R√©giment, which as the 22nd Battalion had won more decorations in the First World War than any other battalion in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. C√¥t√© was assigned as his guide, and afterwards Gamelin recommenced him as a promising young officer. He was promoted to warrant officer in March 1940 and then promoted to staff officer in July 1940 with the Anglo-Canadian VII Corps that had the responsibility of guarding the south-east coast of England against a German invasion. C√¥t√© was assigned to the VII Corps because of Gamelin's recommendation made six months earlier. A prot√©g√© of General Andrew McNaughton, the general officer commanding of the VII Corps and then of the First Canadian Army, C√¥t√© rose rapidly up the ranks. C√¥t√© was impressed to see Guy Simonds, a rising officer who is generally regarded as the most able of Canada's Second World War generals, create the curriculum for a Canadian Junior War Staff Course, single-handed. C√¥t√© described McNaughton as a highly intelligent soldier- scientist who was forever coming up with some new scientific idea and who was very popular with the men who served under him. However, C√¥t√© expressed much concern about whatever McNaughton, who had spent all of the First World War as a \\"gunner\\" (artilleryman) was actually qualified to be a field commander, noting that McNaughton had an obsessive personality for whom no detail was too small. C√¥t√© was astonished to see McNaughton call up Colonel John Ralston, the Minister of National Defence, to complain about the appearance of Canadian Army trucks on aesthetic grounds, saying he wanted Ralston to send more aesthetically pleasing trucks. In common with many other officers who served under McNaughton, C√¥t√© expressed much admiration for him as a man while also feeling that McNaughton's inability to delegate disqualified him from his chosen profession of field commander. McNaughton gave C√¥t√©'s career a major boost by sending him to study at a British Army staff course in September 1940. After graduating from the staff course in Minley Manor, in 1941 he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general of the 1st Division and then as chief of staff of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade. From May 1941 onward, C√¥t√© was assigned to the staff of Major-General George Pearkes, a highly decorated First World War veteran who had been awarded the Victoria Cross in 1917, and was now commadning the 1st Division. C√¥t√© was the only French- Canadian on Pearkes's staff, and found himself missing the cozy and French- speaking atmosphere of the Royal 22e R√©giment. To drive home the point, other staff officers sometimes told C√¥t√© to \\"speak white\\" when he tried to converse with them in French. C√¥t√© found Pearkes to be warm, sympathetic and very brave, but also found that Pearkes was intellectually outclassed by Simonds. In August 1942, C√¥t√© was promoted to deputy adjunct general for the I Canadian Corps commanded by Harry Crerar. In this capacity, he was marginally involved in the planning for the Dieppe raid staged by the 2nd Division on 19 August 1942. C√¥t√© recalled that the expectation was that the Dieppe raid was going to be a great success and that he together with the other officers were shocked with the raid ending in a debacle. Later in 1942, he was promoted to assistant adjutant general of the First Canadian Army. Much to his own surprise, C√¥t√© was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). In 1942, he visited Buckingham Palace to be presented with the MBE insignia by King George VI. In 1943, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and appointed assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, making him responsible for supplying the 15, 000 men of the division with all their needs, an extremely important if unglamorous job. C√¥t√© wrote in his 2006 memoirs R√©miniscences et Souvenances: ‚ÄúI believe we realized pretty quickly that I would be more useful in an administrative role than being in charge of operations, given my lack of experience in the field.‚Äù C√¥t√© described the 3rd Division as being better run and more honestly run than the 2nd Division. C√¥t√© stated that in the 2nd Division if ten jeeps were lost, the division's officers would ask for fifteen replacements whereas the 3rd Division never engaged in this sort of administrative corruption, always reporting its losses truthfully. In January 1944, C√¥t√© was of the few Canadian officers informed of the details of Operation Overlord and was told that the 3rd Division would be landing at a place code-named Juno Beach just beside the French village of Courseulles-sur-Mer in Normandy sometime in the spring of 1944. C√¥t√© recalled about the preparations for Overlord in R√©miniscences et Souvenances: \\"For example, we had to plan our routes in advance, even where no paths existed; we had to bring road signs with us to indicate which way soldiers should go and to identify reinforcement gathering places and the supply stations for water, gasoline, diesel and ammunition, and we had to locate the premises of the first small field hospitals and finally predetermine the location of a cemetery.\\" By May 1944, C√¥t√© reported that his preparations for Overlord were complete and he felt confident that he and his staff were capable of supplying the 3rd Division when it landed in France with all its needs. During the planning for Operation Overlord, C√¥t√© soon realized that General Rod Keller, the GOC of the 3rd Division, had a drinking problem and was not interested in operational details. Keller's chief of staff, Donald Mingay, set up his office in C√¥t√©'s office and the two largely by-passed Keller in planning the landing at Juno Beach. C√¥t√© called Keller a \\"conventional tactician\\" who was \\"very much a spit and polish officer who cut quite a figure in his battledress. We always cut a spare uniform for him, ironed and ready to go just in case. He cared for the division and was sensitive to any slight on its reputation. He was a very proud man and on top of the division's training.\\". As part of the preparations for D-Day, C√¥t√© insisted that the Catholic and Protestant chaplains attached to the 3rd Division all learn each other's prayers for the dead to ensure the prompt burial of those slain in battle. To prevent corruption, he also ensured that the paymasters in the 3rd Division all serve as assistant adjutants in action, thereby ensuring the paymasters would know exactly how men had been killed in action and prevent officers from claiming the wages of the \\"ghost soldiers\\". On D-Day, 6 June 1944, C√¥t√© landed with the 3rd Division on Juno Beach at about 11 am, four hours after the first landing. C√¥t√© remembered in a 2009 Interview: \\"I met the British beach group. They were having elevenses. Morning tea. I asked them to have the dead bodies removed from the beach. Not a good sight for morale. I‚Äôd been told by Corps headquarters that we had to take a lot of wooden crosses over (on the landing craft). I told them to stuff it.\\" C√¥t√© had a low opinion of Keller, observing that the responsibilities of command seemed to be too much for him, and that he was indecisive on D-Day. By contrast, C√¥t√© had a high opinion of Robert Wyman, the GOC of 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade whose \\"tough, no-nonsense\\" style and determination to move inland at once was a refreshing contrast to Keller's chronic indecisiveness. C√¥t√© helped establish the Canadian headquarters in the French village of B√©ny- sur-Mer. C√¥t√© later stated that Wyman \\"gave Keller much guidance which Keller appreciated\\". C√¥t√© commented that Keller was a weak leader, but he and the rest of the staff sought \\"to serve him as best we could\\". C√¥t√© stated that Keller's lack of leadership did not matter on D-Day because of the \\"division's brigadiers rock solid competent individuals\\" while the \\"performance of the brigades during and right after the landing was marvelous\\". During the Battle of Caen, which followed the D-Day landings, Keller collapsed under the stress, suffering a nervous break-down, and was relieved of command on 8 August 1944. C√¥t√© served with the 3rd Division during the Battle of Caen and in the Battle of the Scheldt. For courage under fire, C√¥t√© was mentioned in dispatches. In December 1944, he returned to Canada to be promoted colonel and given an array of senior jobs in the Department of National Defence in Ottawa as the vice- adjutant general of medical and dental corps. During this time, he met Lieutenant Madeleine Fr√©mont and married her on 16 June 1945 in Ottawa. Fremont was the daughter of the Quebec City lawyer Charles Fremont and the feminist Tha√Øs Lacoste-Fr√©mont. The couple had four children Lucie, Beno√Æt, Denyse and Michel. Diplomat and civil servant After the end of the war, C√¥t√© left the Army to purse a diplomatic career, joining the Department of External Affairs as a second secretary. In November 1945, he arrived in London as part of the Canadian delegation for the first ever general session of the newly founded United Nations. In 1946, C√¥t√© played an important role in writing the charter of newly formed World Health Organization. In 1947 and 1948, he served as the secretary-general of the Canadian delegation at the sessions of the United Nations, which were now being held in New York. At the 1948 fall sessions of the United Nations held in Paris, the Canadian delegation was headed by the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, and C√¥t√© served as one of his advisers. C√¥t√© met every Canadian prime minister from Mackenzie King to Stephen Harper. In 1949, C√¥t√© was stationed with the Canadian high commission in London, where he studied geopolitics at the Imperial Defence College, and then served as the legal adviser in the high commission based in Canada House. In 1952, he returned to Ottawa to take charge of the Consular Division and then served as the head of the Americas Division. In 1952, he also appointed legal counsel to the International Joint Commission in charge of waters shared by the United States and Canada. In 1955, he was appointed assistant deputy minister in the national resources sector of Northern Affairs department. During this time, he oversaw the restoration of the Fortress Louisbourg in Cape Breton Island, negotiated a treaty with the United States concerning migratory birds and worked with the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway. During the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the U.S. government wanted control of all three locks, but C√¥t√© during his negotiations with the Americans ensured that Canada had control of one of the locks and a say in the running of the other two. In 1963, he was appointed deputy minister of Northern Affairs. In 1965, he was appointed by Prime Minister Lester Pearson to head the committee that planned the Centennial celebrations of 1967 to mark the 100th anniversary of Confederation. From 1968 to 1972, C√¥t√© sat on the board of governors of the University of Ottawa representing Saint Paul University. During the time of campus protests at Canadian universities, his daughter Denyse, was invoked in the protests at the University of Ottawa while he sat on the board of the University of Ottawa. She recalled: \\"\\"I remember it because I was a leftie at the time. He was a very liberal man and we never argued. At one point he drove me to a demonstration at the University of Ottawa and said, 'Good luck with your revolution.' And I said, 'Good look with your repression.' The fact that I was a leftie, he didn't take it personally.\\" As a French-Canadian from Alberta, C√¥t√© was against Quebec separatism, seeing all of Canada as his homeland and rejected the concept that Quebec was the special homeland of French-Canadians. In 1968 after briefly working as a deputy minister at Veteran Affairs, he appointed deputy solicitor-general, making him in charge of overseeing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and as such he found himself in the eye of the storm during the 1970 October Crisis. During the October crisis, C√¥t√© was in charge of a task force that reported to the prime minister Pierre Trudeau with the responsibility of analyzing intelligence about what was happening in Quebec. C√¥t√© role as a deputy solicitor-general caused much tension within his family with one of his children supporting the FLQ as \\"freedom fighters\\". C√¥t√© himself was somewhat surprised by the Trudeau's use of the War Measure Act to fight the FLQ as he wrote in his memoirs: \\"The Armed Forces, fully armed, patrolled the streets of Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa and stood guard at the residences of important people. Unheard of in the 20th century!\\" In December 1970, C√¥t√© submitted a report to Trudeau that claimed the FLQ had a total membership of about 150 organized in 30 cells, and concluded: \\"The Task Force is convinced that the revolutionary thrust of groups in Canada is towards the total breakdown of government as a step towards establishing international socialism\\". C√¥t√© had a poor working relationship with the Solicitor-General Jean-Pierre Goyer, who was the only cabinet minister he criticized in his memoirs. Goyer appointed his mistress as his chief of staff despite her manifest lack of qualifications and awarded her various privileges such as a free pass with Air Canada allowing to fly anywhere she wanted at the expense of the taxpayers. Making things more awkward was the fact that Goyer was already married, thus forcing C√¥t√© to constantly lie to his wife when she called the solicitor-general's office inquiring as to where her husband was. C√¥t√© accused Goyer of having \\"clearly decided to exercise the functions of deputy minister, contrary to instructions he had received from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau\\", and resigned in protest in 1972 against his corruption. In 1972, he was appointed Canadian ambassador to Finland. He retired in 1975. Retirement After his retirement, he settled in Ottawa, where he became a member of Association des communaut√©s francophones d‚ÄôOttawa and was active in campaigning for Ontario to support French language secondary schools. C√¥t√©'s lobbying was successful and Ontario agreed to fund French language high schools. He was active on the board of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, where served as a director and governor. Denis St. Onge, the former president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society recalled: \\"He was very proud of his country and its flag. He was such a great guy\\". In 1991, his wife Madeline died. In 2004, the French government made him a Knight of the Legion of Honour. In 2014, he returned to France three times. On 20 April 2014, C√¥t√© returned to Normandy to attend the premiere of the film Code Secret:Les Carottes Sont Cuites, a documentary directed by the Montreal journalist Alain Stank√©. On 6 June 2014, he returned to Juno Beach at the age of 100 to take part in the ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day. On 11 November 2014, C√¥t√© returned to Juno Beach again to lay a wreath to honor the Canadians killed in the Normandy campaign, where his presence as the last living colonel who served in the Canadian Army in World War Two attracted large crowds. On 18 December 2014, a local thug and criminal named Ian Bush robbed C√¥t√©'s home and tied him up with a plastic bag around his head with the intention of killing him. C√¥t√© told the media at the time: \\"Some people think that if you‚Äôre 101 years of age, you crumble up and wonder, ‚ÄòOh why, what was happening.‚Äô No, I was just mad.\\" C√¥t√© was break to free and call the Ottawa police who arrested Bush. Bush was charged with robbery and attempted murder. DNA testing subsequently showed that Bush was responsible for a brutal triple murder in June 2007 of an Ottawa judge Alban Garon, his wife Raymonde, and their neighbour, Marie-Claire Beniskos. In another interview, C√¥t√© stated: \\"Life is such that when you see these things happen to you, you try to get out. The important thing is to concentrate on how to get out of the position in which you happen to be. If you‚Äôre afraid and paralyzed, you don‚Äôt move. I was never afraid. I was not afraid of the landing, the D-Day landing. I was not afraid of this attacker.\\" C√¥t√©'s neighbor, J. Blair Seaborn, told the media: \\"He had the wits about him to realize he had to get the damn bag off his head if he was going to live. He crawled across the floor to where he knew there was some scissors and cut the thing off. He had a good deal of presence of mind for someone who‚Äôs just been attacked by a much younger man. He didn‚Äôt panic. He did what was necessary. Even at 101 he was not intimidated\\". On 18 May 2017, Bush was found guilty of three counts of first degree murder relating to the triple murder of 2007. On 1 December 2017, Bush was found guilty of one count of attempted murder and one count of robbery relating to the December 2014 break-in of C√¥t√©'s home. Justice Robert Beaudoin stated when sentencing Bush: \\"I consider Ernest C√¥t√© to be a hero. He was certainly a hero when he landed on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. His friends and family would say that he's a hero every day of his life and throughout his career of public service. He most certainly was a hero on Dec. 18, 2014.\\" C√¥te died of natural causes on 25 February 2015. One of his friends, Louise Maffett said of him: \\"He was an old-school gentleman and with his death an era has passed.\\" His daughter Denyse described him: \\"Ernest C√¥t√© was of course an old-school gentleman. He belonged to this generation of men, always impeccably dressed...fond of rituals most probably acquired from his prolonged stays in Great Britain. He embraced passionately his new role as a single dad when his dear Madeleine passed away, facing the culinary challenges of his sister-in-law, initiating family get-togethers and taking care of children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces\\". In April 2015, the French government posthumously awarded C√¥t√© the Order of La Pl√©iade to honor him for his work in fighting for more French language schools in Ontario.

T. Light George Thomas Light (1820 ‚Äì 24 January 1896), commonly referred to as G. T. Light, was an organist, instrument maker and architect in the early days of the British colony of South Australia. History Light was born in England in 1820, a son of music teacher Thomas Light, and christened at St Andrews Church, Clifton, on 18 September 1820. He was employed in the fields of musical instrument maker and technician, optician, modeller and engineering draftsman, as well as being a more than competent keyboard player. He emigrated to South Australia, ship unknown, arriving in 1848 or early 1849. He married Marian Wilson in September 1850 at St Matthew's Church of England, Kensington; they would have six children, of whom four survived infancy. He worked as a piano tuner and foundry draftsman in Adelaide. :By another account, Light was born in 1838, was employed as a musical instrument maker and draftsman at a foundry in Bristol, England, before emigrating to South Australia around 1854 and died in 1911. None of these dates stands scrutiny. Light joined the Colonial Architect‚Äôs office in 1856 as a temporary draftsman, made a permanent appointment on 1 January 1857. He became assistant architect when Edward John Woods was appointed Architect-in-Chief in 1874. In 1879 Light took leave of absence, joining J. A. Hornabrook in a partnership, with offices in Santo's Building. Light's wife died in 1882, and he left the Department in 1883. In 1884 he joined in partnership with the newly-arrived R. G. Holwell (died 1906) as Light and Holwell, at the Old Exchange. The partnership was dissolved in August 1884 and Light moved to Western Australia, where his sons had settled.  Architect  ;Government Light designed the royal coat of arms ornament on the Treasury building designed by Edward A. Hamilton in 1858. In 1859 Light designed the court house and police station at Goolwa. He was also credited with the police station at Auburn. In 1873 he drew formal plans for a new Parliament House to a sketch by G. S. Kingston. They were not used, but he was appointed to the panel of judges who selected the winning design from the competition which was held subsequently. In the period 1874‚Äì1878 while he was with the Engineer-in-Chiefs office, he would have been largely responsible for many of the department's designs, including the Guard House, work on the Treasury Buildings and House of Assembly Chamber, General Post Office and the Library and Museum on North Terrace. They supervised erection of German-made prefabricated Palm House in the Botanic Gardens designed by Gustav Runge and opened in 1877. They designed the North Adelaide Primary School. Light is believed to have designed the south-west section of Government House, the Jervois wing of the State Library of South Australia, the Norwood police station. ;Private No records have been found relating to his work with Hornabrook. Light and Holwell designed St Mark's Church at Woodside. Light and Holwell were architects of the Parkside post and telegraph office, an elaborate complex with an attached hall designed to accommodate 500 people. It is likely he prepared the plans for the replacement St John's church in Halifax Street where Light was the first organist. These plans were presented by Holwell alone to the church committee in December 1884, as were the plans for the tower and other improvements to St George's Church, Gawler.  Musician  Light first came to public attention in September 1849, when he was giving recitals at the Pulteney Street school on Sundays after church service, presiding on the euphonicon, which instrument was reported as sounding like a pipe organ, and (erroneously) crediting its invention to Light though it may have been built by him in England before emigrating. By November 1849 he had established a workshop and showroom in Pirie Street, \\"adjacent Wilson's iron store\\" for manufacturing the euphonicon, and also had a Broadwood piano for hire. In 1853 he had a shop on Rundle Street east, \\"nearly opposite the Exeter Hotel\\", advertising his services as piano and harmonium repairer and tuner, later having such instruments for sale. By August 1855 he was also advertising his services as a music teacher, and moved his place of business to Franklin Street east. His first appointment as church organist was at St John's on Halifax Street until July 1852, when he moved to the Swedenborgian church on Carrington Street; at its first service playing on the euphonicon. Light was in 1854 the first organist employed by St Andrew's Church, Walkerville, presiding at the harmonium at the Walkerville School's annual festival and the debut of the North Adelaide Choral Society and many concerts at which C.

Lamp Cottage, also known as Rocky Roost, was a summer cottage on a small island on Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin. The cottage was designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright for boyhood friend, Robert M. Lamp (1866-1916), for whom Wright also designed the Lamp House in Madison. There was a cottage on the island by 1893, and there is some disagreement on whether or not Wright had something to do with its construction.http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Artifact%20Pages/PhRtS021.htm By the turn of the century, several cottages were constructed on the small island and it is known that in 1901‚Äì02, Wright tied the cottages together into one structure,John O.

Wisconsin Magazine of History, The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Vol. 72, No. 2, Winter, 1988-89, 104. which is the known cottage for Robert Lamp that appears in postcards and photographs. The cottage was a two-story tall building with horizontal siding and a wrap-around porch on the second floor. In 1902‚Äì03, a windmill was added on the island to bring water to the cottage. Evidence points toward the cottage burning in late 1934 to early 1935. According to Wright scholar, John O.

Its nearest higher peak is Snowfield Peak, to the west, and Styloid Peak rises to the east. Precipitation runoff from Mantis Peak drains into Neve Creek and McAllister Creek, both tributaries of Thunder Creek. With a steep north face sculpted by the Neve Glacier, relief is significant as the summit rises 4,000 feet above the head of Neve Creek valley in less than one mile, and the south side rises 5,400 feet above McAllister Creek valley in . The first ascent of Mantis Peak was made August 16, 1973 by Marilyn and Stan Jensen. \\"Distal Phalanx\\", the slightly higher twin summit, was first climbed on May 31, 1981, by John Roper and party, on the same day that he climbed Styloid Peak. Roper, being a doctor, named some of his many first ascents for anatomical parts of the body. Climate Mantis Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Northwest aspect of Mantis Peak and Distal Phalanx from Neve Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Ramsay (born 5 September 1942) is a Canadian statistician and Professor Emeritus at McGill University, Montreal, who developed much of the statistical theory behind multidimensional scaling (MDS). Together with co- author Bernard Silverman, he is widely recognized as the founder of functional data analysis. He wrote four influential books and over 100 peer-reviewed articles in statistical and psychometric journals. In 1998, the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) awarded him a gold medal for research in 1998. In 2012 the SCS awarded him with an honorary membership. He was president of the Psychometric Society in 1981‚Äì1982 and president of the SSC in 2002‚Äì2003. Over his career, \\"three of his papers were read to the Royal Statistical Society, and another won The Canadian Journal of Statistics 2000 Best Paper Award.\\" In retirement, as of 2010, he continued to hold adjunct appointments at Department of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa.personal home page hosted at mcgill.ca Family life James Ramsay was born in Prince George, British Columbia on 5 September 1942, but didn't long reside there. In his early years, the family spent time in Smithers, British Columbia, Richdale, Alberta, Flaxcombe, Saskatchewan, and Wainwright, Alberta. His father worked as a telegrapher on the Canadian National Railway. He has five children with his wife, Maureen. His son Tim Ramsay grew up to become a statistician, winning a Pierre Robillard Award while attending Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario; they have since collaborated on publications in their professional relationship. Education Ramsay was an avid reader of Charles Dickens by the age of 12. \\"Through literature I became interested in basically everything\\" except for mathematics, which he regarded during his high school years as trivial and non-interesting. He attended the University of Alberta for his undergraduate degree, studying literature, linguistics, and psychology, attaining a bachelor's degree in Education. While attending the University of Alberta, he aced an introductory course in statistics, which lead him to calculus, his first taste of advanced mathematics. \\"That was a real eye-opener to me; it just blew me away!\\" He degree program did not offer him many opportunities to take further math instruction, but his preferred learning style was autodidactic, and he often skipped lectures in order to read at home, where he could read as he chose. Upon graduating in 1964, his mentor, psychometrician Stephen M. Hunka encouraged him to apply to graduate programs at Berkeley, Illinois, and Princeton; with his relatively weak background in mathematics, he was surprised to be accepted by all three. He chose Princeton where he had a \\"hefty fellowship\\" from the Educational Testing Service (ETS). At Princeton, his formal supervisor was Harold Gulliksen. Ramsay's Princeton dissertation concerned MDS, \\"formalizing seminal contributions to the mathematical formulation\\" by Joseph Kruskal. During his time at Princeton, he had regular contact with research scientists at Bell Labs, including Joseph Kruskal, John Chambers (creator of the S programming language; core member of the R programming language project), and Douglas Carroll, a leading psychometrician of the era. Career Ramsay joined the Department of Psychology at McGill at a high ebb; at that time the department was associated with Donald Hebb (pioneering work in neural networks), Ronald Melzack (pain), Virginia Douglas (hyperactivity), and Dalbir Bindra (comparative and physiological psychology). His colleagues and collaborators over a long career include James V. Zidek (O.C.), Joseph Kruskal, Suzanne Winsberg, Melvin R. Novick, James B. Ramsey, Nancy E. Heckman, and Giles Hooker. Over the years Ramsay took sabbaticals at University College London, Grenoble, and Toulouse. His professional influences include Karl J√∂reskog, Frederic Lord, Duncan Luce, and Peter J. Huber. Interests With his background in English literature, Ramsay has long been an inveterate reader. Ramsay's favourite fiction author is George Eliot. \\"In my mind she stands head and shoulders above everybody else in the whole field of English literature, the giant among giants.\\" His favourite biography concerns Sir William Osler, born in rural Ontario, Canada in 1849, who went on to become one of the four founding fathers of Johns Hopkins Hospital, and made pioneering contributions to the system of medical residency. During his youth and adult years, Ramsay was an keen cyclist. At age 16 he completed a 1400 km journey though the Canadian Rockies, much of it on a one-track logging road that subsequently became the Yellowhead Highway. Later on, during his European sabbaticals, he sought out bicycle routes used in the professional tour. Due to his own misjudgement, he was once taken off the Col du Galibier by ambulance in an advanced state of hypothermia. Publications * Ramsay, J.O., Hooker, G., Campbell, D. & Cao, J. (2007).

The 1943 legislative session was unusual. The session opened on January 11. While there were only three Democrats in the Oregon State Senate that session, the chamber could not agree on a senate president. As the senior member of the senate, Strayer presided over the leadership debate. There were two Republicans competing for the senate president position. Senator William H. Steiwer of Fossil had 15 supporters, while Senator Dorothy McCullough Lee of Portland also had 15 supporters. As a result, there was a succession of 44 tie votes, before Lee withdrew from the race on condition that committee appointments be made jointly with Strayer breaking the tie if Steiwer and Lee disagreed on any specific appointment. Steiwer was elected senate president on the 45th ballot. Together Steiwer and Lee made the committee appointments as agreed. Strayer was appointed chairman of the engrossed and enrolled bills committee. He was also given a seat on the ways and means, rules, mining, resolutions, and revision of laws committees.

The 1945 legislative session began on January 8 with Strayer once again serving in the senate's small Democratic minority. During the session, he served as chairman of engrossed and enrolled bills committee and vice chairman of rules committee. He was also a member of ways and means, mining, resolutions, and revision of laws committees. Near the end of the legislature session, Strayer was re-appointed as chairman of the state department of geology and mineral industries oversight board, a position he had held since the board was established. The session lasted almost ten weeks, ending on March 17.\\"1945 Regular Session (43rd) January 8 ‚Äì March 17\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon State Archives, Salem, Oregon, accessed July 26, 2020.; \\"Standing Committees Listed for State Senate and House\\",Eugene Guard, Eugene, Oregon, January 12, 1945, p. 2.

As a result, he was unopposed in the general election.\\"Angell Files for Re- election\\",Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, March 4, 1946, p. 11.; {https://www.newspapers.com/image/94689707/?terms=%22William%2BH.%2BStrayer%22 \\"Both Parties May Nominate\\"],Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, October 19, 1946, p. 12. However, during the year a court case arose that questioned whether individuals serving on state boards and commission could concurrently serve in the state legislature. While Strayer was not specifically identified in the legal proceedings, as the chairman of the state's oversight board for the department of geology and mineral industries, the outcome of the case could have affected his ability to serve in the legislature.\\"Asks Comments About Sackett Be Stricken\\", Eugene Guard, Eugene, Oregon, February 5, 1946, p. 6.

After nine months of litigation, the court ruled that members of the legislature could not hold concurrent state administrative positions. It was expected that Strayer and the other two state senators affected by the decision would appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court. However, Strayer died less than a month after the decision, so no appeal was filed on his behalf.\\"Duel Office Holding Counted Out\\", Coos Bay World, Coos Bay, Oregon, September 23, 1946, p. 4.\\"Strayer Funeral at baker Tuesday\\",Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, October 23, 1946, p. 1.

He was buried in the Strayer family plot at Mount Hope Cemetery in Baker. His funeral was attended by six state senators representing Governor Earl Snell and the Oregon State Senate. Strayer had served in the Oregon State Senate for 32 years. When he died, he was finishing his eighth four-year term in the senate. That made him the longest- serving legislator in Oregon history at that time. Today, Strayer is the second-longest-serving legislator in Oregon history.Loew, Tracy and Jonathan Bach \\"Peter Courtney Keeps Senate Seat, Shattering Record for Longest Serving Oregon Legislator\\",Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, November 6, 2018.

It is manufactured by Chinese company Gamepad Digital (GPD), and crowdfunded just as its predecessor was. Announced in the first quarter of 2020, the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign officially kicked off on May 18, 2020 at a price of $779, and concluded on July 1, 2020 with over 3500 backers contributing over $2.8 million dollars. The GPD Win Max is rated to run AAA video game titles and emulate consoles from the sixth generation and earlier, with some support for consoles up to the eighth generation.  History  Following the GPD Win 2 in 2018, and the larger GPD Pocket 2 in 2019, GPD announced their largest device yet as the GPD Win Max. This device is the size of a Netbook, and retains GPD's signature embedded controller. The Win Max was leaked and received media coverage as early as April 2019, with conclusive coverage coming in April, 2020. After the conclusion of the Indiegogo campaign on July 1, 2020 the price of the Win max rose from $779 to $800 while remaining on sale via Indemand until July 15.  Design  With the Win Max being GPD's largest gaming device as of release, there was room for additions such a scissor switch keyboard which would support touch typing, similar to what is available on their GPD Pocket Range, as well as a touchpad, and an 8\\" screen. This unit also introduces GPD's first instance of clickable analog sticks, one of which has been moved inside the ABXY buttons, as well as buttons with a very similar style to the PlayStation Vita (with a layout and markings similar to the Xbox). The Win Max speakers have been moved underneath the unit towards the user. Access to the M.2 drive has been reduced, as the unit must be disassembled to change this drive. An ethernet port has been added to the right side of the device, which would prevent a user from effectively holding the console while this port is in use. This increase in size has also allowed an increase in cooling potential of the Max with dual fans and Heat pipes. Otherwise, the Win Max maintains a similar design to previous units with a milled magnesium aluminum alloy chassis and an ABS plastic shell. With the far side of the device providing access to two USB-A ports, four shoulder buttons, a USB-C port as well as a Thunderbolt 3 port, and a small reset button. The back panel also includes another change: the win series' first full-size HDMI port.  Performance  Release and Reception  Win Max units started shipping to Indiegogo backers on August 17, 2020.

History In the United Kingdom, provision for the care of the mentally ill began in the early 19th century with a large state-led effort. Public mental asylums were established in Britain after the passing of the 1808 County Asylums Act. This empowered magistrates to build rate-supported asylums in every county to house the many 'pauper lunatics'. Nine counties first applied, and the first public asylum opened in 1812 in Nottinghamshire. Parliamentary Committees were established to investigate abuses at private madhouses like Bethlem Hospital - its officers were eventually dismissed and national attention was focused on the routine use of bars, chains and handcuffs and the filthy conditions the inmates lived in. However, it was not until 1828 that the newly appointed Commissioners in Lunacy were empowered to license and supervise private asylums. Lord Shaftesbury, a vigorous campaigner for the reform of lunacy law in England, and the Head of the Lunacy Commission for 40 years. The Lunacy Act 1845 was an important landmark in the treatment of the mentally ill, as it explicitly changed the status of mentally ill people to patients who required treatment. The Act created the Lunacy Commission, headed by Lord Shaftesbury, to focus on lunacy legislation reform.Unsworth, Clive.\\"Law and Lunacy in Psychiatry's 'Golden Age'\\", Oxford Journal of Legal Studies. Vol. 13, No. 4. (Winter, 1993), pp. 482. The commission was made up of eleven Metropolitan Commissioners who were required to carry out the provisions of the Act;Wright, David: \\"Mental Health Timeline\\", 1999 the compulsory construction of asylums in every county, with regular inspections on behalf of the Home Secretary. All asylums were required to have written regulations and to have a resident qualified physician. A national body for asylum superintendents - the Medico- Psychological Association - was established in 1866 under the Presidency of William A. F. Browne, although the body appeared in an earlier form in 1841.Shorter, E. (1997), p. 34, 41 In 1838, France enacted a law to regulate both the admissions into asylums and asylum services across the country. √âdouard S√©guin developed a systematic approach for training individuals with mental deficiencies, and, in 1839, he opened the first school for the intellectually disabled. His method of treatment was based on the idea that the intellectually disabled did not suffer from disease. In the United States, the erection of state asylums began with the first law for the creation of one in New York, passed in 1842. The Utica State Hospital was opened approximately in 1850. The creation of this hospital, as of many others, was largely the work of Dorothea Lynde Dix, whose philanthropic efforts extended over many states, and in Europe as far as Constantinople. Many state hospitals in the United States were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the Kirkbride Plan, an architectural style meant to have curative effect. At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums.Shorter, E. (1997), p. 34 By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization was soon disappointed.Shorter, E. (1997), p. 46 Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population. The average number of patients in asylums kept on growing. Asylums were quickly becoming almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions,Rothman, D.J. (1990). The Discovery of the Asylum: Social Order and Disorder in the New Republic. Boston: Little Brown, p. 239. and the reputation of psychiatry in the medical world had hit an extreme low.Shorter, E. (1997), p. 65 In the United States and most other developed societies, severe restrictions have been placed on the circumstances under which a person may be committed or treated against their will as such actions have been ruled by the United States Supreme Court and other national legislative bodies as a violation of civil rights and/or human rights (see e.g. O'Connor v. Donaldson). Thus a person is rarely committed against their will and it is illegal for a person to be committed for an indefinite period of time. Criticism The dangers of institutions were chronicled and criticized by reformers almost since their foundation. Charles Dickens was an outspoken and high-profile early critic, and several of his novels, in particular Oliver Twist and Hard Times demonstrate his insight into the damage that institutions can do to human beings. Enoch Powell, when Minister for Health in the early 1960s, was a later opponent who was appalled by what he witnessed on his visits to the asylums, and his famous \\"water tower\\" speech in 1961 called for the closure of all NHS asylums and their replacement by wards in general hospitals: > \\"There they stand, isolated, majestic, imperious, brooded over by the > gigantic water-tower and chimney combined, rising unmistakable and daunting > out of the countryside - the asylums which our forefathers built with such > immense solidity to express the notions of their day. Do not for a moment > underestimate their powers of resistance to our assault. Let me describe > some of the defenses which we have to storm.\\" Scandal after scandal followed, with many high-profile public inquiries. These involved the exposure of abuses such as unscientific surgical techniques such as lobotomy and the widespread neglect and abuse of vulnerable patients in the US and Europe. The growing anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s led in Italy to the first successful legislative challenge to the authority of the mental institutions, culminating in their closure. During the 1970s and 1990s the hospital population started to fall rapidly, mainly because of the deaths of long-term inmates. Significant efforts were made to re-house large numbers of former residents in a variety of suitable or otherwise alternative accommodation. The first 1,000+ bed hospital to close was Darenth Park Hospital in Kent, swiftly followed by many more across the UK.

A relatively unknown figure until he publicised his teachings in Tunisia after the 2011 revolution, followers of al-Hazimi's views briefly wielded considerable power within the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He was arrested and imprisoned by Saudi authorities in 2015.  Views  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's \\"third nullifier of Islam\\" states that those who do not acknowledge the disbelief of a disbeliever commit an act of apostasy. Al-Hazimi extends the nullifier to those who refrain from excommunicating those considered \\"ignorant\\", a doctrine known as takfir al-‚Äòadhir (\\"excommunication of the excuser\\"). Critics argue takfir al-‚Äòadhir leads to an indefinite chain of excommunication. Al-Hazimi's affinity with Salafi jihadism has been debated by its supporters. Despite the adoption of takfir al-‚Äòadhir by elements of the movement, al-Hazimi has been described as \\"not himself a jihadi\\".  Life  Born in Mecca, al-Hazimi completed his bachelor's degree at Umm al-Qura University, majoring in the Quran and Sunnah. He also studied under Muslim scholars in the Great Mosque of Mecca, including in logic and Arabic grammar. He served as the imam of his local mosque in Mecca's Al-Zahir neighbourhood. Over the course of four visits to Tunisia between December 2011 and May 2012, al-Hazimi delivered a series of lectures promoting takfir al-‚Äòadhir in association with local Islamist organisations linked with Ansar al-Sharia. With their aid, al-Hazimi established the Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani Institute for Sharia Sciences in the country, a religious institute that instructed in his views. Several Tunisian adherents of al- Hazimi's positions later joined ISIS, disseminating the concept of takfir al-‚Äòadhir and becoming a potent ideological force within the group. In 2013, al-Hazimi uploaded several online lectures regarding takfir al-‚Äòadhir which were attacked by Turki al-Binali, a senior ISIS religious scholar who was the principal opponent of Hazimi influence on the organisation. In the following years, several Hazimis excommunicated ISIS' leadership and revolted against the group, who in turn labelled them as \\"extremists\\" and initiated a crackdown on the movement. On 28 April 2015, al-Hazimi was arrested in Saudi Arabia and later imprisoned.

The villa was commissioned by the powerful magnate, nobleman and art collector Ferdinando Vandeneynden, also known as Ferdinand van den Eynde,https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/489290https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/Eynde%2C%20Jan%20van%20denfrom the Carthusian architect Bonaventura Presti. History The villa was built at the end of 17th century as an \\"out of town\\" palace by the wealthy Flemish merchant and banker (who was awarded the title of Marquis of Castelnuovo and married the noblewoman Olimpia Piccolomini, nephew of Cardinal Celio) Ferdinando Vandeneynden, or Ferdinand van den Eynde, son of the wealthy merchant Jan van den Eynde, on the western slope of the Vomero hill, in what is now via Belvedere. The Netherlandish nobleman, whose father had chosen Naples as his residence and the place wherein establishing his own business (like many other powerful Northern European traders), had previously commissioned from a Carthusian monk the renovation of numerous patrician residences in the city (among which the Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano, which had been acquired by his father Jan); however, Villa Belvedere, which Van den Eynde ordered him to realize from scratch, is perhaps the only work entirely done by this architect-friar, whose name was Bonaventura Presti. Villa Belvedere in an old print The Vandeneynden palace was built between 1671 and 1673 according to the design of Presti. Located at the end of a long tree- lined avenue, with its entrance on the via del Vomero (via Belvedere), the building develops on two levels with a polygonal system with a courtyard closed on three sides, opening into a loggia to the west, in the direction of the hill of Posillipo. The whole project was based essentially on perspective, and it was strongly influenced by the surrounding landscape, with the Gulf of Naples to the south, and Posillipo to the west. The Vandeneynden palace became Villa Carafa di Belvedere in 1688, when Elizabeth, daughter of the Marquis Vandeneynden, who died of consumption in 1674, married Charles Carafa IV, Prince of Belvedere. The Carafas improved the villa by adding loggias overlooking the panorama of the gulf. Along the tree-lined avenue, which, as mentioned, constituted the access to the villa, sheds and stables were arranged, as well as an elegant eighteenth-century well in marble. Courtyard of Villa Belvedere The tuff necessary to carry out these alterations was taken from a part of the hill beyond the large terrace, wherein a cave was dug. The hole was later used as a cellar for the conservation of wine and meat. The cave was accessed via a well-shaped staircase which is still extant. Villa Belvedere was very popular among the Neapolitan upper classes and the local nobles, including the Bourbons; during the summer vacations of queen Maria Carolina of Habsburg-Lorraine, wife of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, magnificent parties were held, which attracted huge crowds. In fact, in the months of May and October, the villa was open to the public; so that on Thursdays and Sundays it was possible to attend musical concerts, and, later, even popular jousting and tournaments. The popularity of the villa did not decrease under French rule: the building was one of the favorite resorts of Gioacchino Murat. Inside the villa there was a precious collection of paintings and sculptures, which was assembled by Ferdinand, who in turn had inherited the prestigious collection of his father, while the vaults are still embellished with frescoes by artists such as Luca Giordano. Ferdinand van den Eynde's precious art collection (which included several paintings by Luca Giordano) was later inherited by the Carafas and the Colonnas, as his two daughters, Elizabeth and Giovanna (Joanna), married the heirs of the Carafa and Colonna families, respectively. Between the first and second half of the seventeenth century, through his commerce between Flanders and Naples (which included also artworks) Van den Eynde, an avid art collector and art dealer, favored the circulation in Naples of new tastes and stylistic currents. In his collection, therefore, there were also several works by notable foreign artists. As regards Giordano's paintings in Van de Eynde's collection, included in the dowries of his two daughters, in the The Lives of the Artists it is reported: > [A]mong these works (by Luca Giordano), noted as in a catalog, I learned > that those that belonged to D. Ferdinando Vandeneinden, were then assigned, > with the other rich furnishings among the very rich gifts, to two Princes, > namely that of Sonnino, whose name is D. Giuliano Colonna Romano, and to > that of Belvedere, whose name is D. Carlo Carafa, our Neapolitan, to whom > the aforementioned D. Ferdinando married his two beautiful, honest and noble > daughters  Architecture and current state of conservation  Embankment of Villa Belvedere The architecture of the villa, as it appears today, is the result of about five centuries of stratification, with works and adjustments that have followed one another according to taste, both of the architects and the clients involved. The contemplation of this building allows, even today, to recognize the original elements, as well as the extensions and modifications executed during the 18th century. The latter have exalted the idea of its relationship with nature, which was a fundamental aspect of the original project, and which survives today despite the most recent alterations. Villa Belvedere represents a unique example of the oldest history of its neighborhood, Vomero. It is around this structure, in fact, that the ancient Villaggio del Vomero developed. Over the centuries, there were numerous travelers who became fascinated with it, to the point of immortalizing it in painting, drawings and sketches. Designed to open up to the surrounding nature, it is today squeezed between the buildings that have deprived it of its greenery. However, the villa still faces the Gulf of Naples. Terrace of Villa Belvedere Comparing Duke Carafa of Noja's plan of 1775 with the view of the first Carafa's architects (ca. 1698), it is possible to discern the transformations that mark the passage from Palazzo Vandeneynden to Villa Carafa of Belvedere. It is possible to discern the progressive arrangement of the whole structure, starting from the entrance on the via del Vomero where an exedra was built (right in front of the ancient portal in peperino) to make it easier for carriages to access. The pre-existing avenue leads to a portico, which encloses a semi-elliptical courtyard facing the north facade of the building. The loggia is connected to the main floor and acts as an element of mediation between the avenue itself and the access to the building, without interrupting the perspective axis that from the entrance crosses the entire structure as well as the terrace garden. The garden, bordered by a peperino balustrade with marble columns, is surrounded to the east by a long portico closed by glass walls, used as a greenhouse. The rooms on the piano nobile are projected towards the panorama via the large level terraces placed to the side of the northern and southern elevations. Embankment of Villa Belvedere Of the prominence of Villa Belvedere we find numerous testimonies also in the eighteenth-century vedutismo of the city of Naples. The villa became in fact the symbol of the hill of Vomero, and foreign painters and engravers would represent it as a characteristic element. By the end of the 19th century, mutation began to involve progressive aggregation to a small extent. Those which were initially conceived as open but covered spaces, of mediation, but above all of adhesion between nature and constructed, started to get closed off according to the new housing needs. With available spaces now saturated, a series of interventions, with the aim of offering timely responses to specific needs, began. These have produced a building complex which is characterized by alterations typical of a general architectural degradation. Hemicycle of Villa Belvedere Further, at the beginning of the 20th century, Villa Belvedere, by now a condominium, lost its status as one of the few buildings on the Vomero hill. Construction of new buildings deprived the villa of its status as a 'paradise of delights' surrounded by greenery, and, over the years, buildings of all sizes and kinds rose, ousting its greenery, as the zone got progressively lotted out. New entrances to the villa were opened along the via Aniello Falcone, leveraging the few interstices spared by the urbanization. As mentioned, even today, albeit deeply mutated, the villa still interacts with the scenic view of the gulf, and represents a strong and living memento of Vomero's past.

Early years Dylevsky was born on 1 September 1989 in Minsk to working-class parents, who, , were employees at Minsk Tractor Works (MTZ). He studied machine construction at a technical college in Minsk and chose to become a steel temperer. 2020 election protests Following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election and continuing 2020 Belarusian protests in early August 2020, Dylevsky was angered by security forces' violent crackdown on protestors. He drove several protestors to hospitals and called for a strike at Minsk Tractor Works (MTZ). He was joined in the strike by workers calling for political prisoners to be release and for new elections, leading a group of 1000 workers on a march to the centre of Minsk. On 17 August he led a march of 5000 striking MTZ workers. On 18 August, Dylevksy stated that 50 people demonstrating in front of MTZ to support the workers were briefly detained. On 19 August, Dylevsky was chosen as one of the members of the presidium of the Coordination Council, which aims to coordinate a transition of political power from president Alexander Lukashenko who claims to have won the 9 August 2020 Belarusian presidential election. On 20 August, Alexander Konyuk, the Prosecutor-General of Belarus, initiated criminal proceedings against the members of the Coordination Council under Article 361 of the Belarusian Criminal Code, on the grounds of attempting to seize state power and harming national security. By 21 August, Dylevsky had become a \\"political star\\" according to the New York Times. Dylevsky stated that he considered the Belarusian industrial system to be inefficient and that the lack of oligarchs in Belarus was \\"far from being an achievement\\", since it meant that \\"sound\\" business people did not wish to invest in Belarus. Dylevsky stated that politics would be \\"the last thing [that he] would like to do\\" and then stated his intention to remove Lukashenko from power. He considers Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to be the legitimate president of Belarus.

The market operated from 1814 to 1966, and was Columbus's first city hall, from 1850 to 1872. It moved three times, each time into successively larger buildings. The third market stood the longest time, from 1850 to 1966, when it was demolished as part of the Market-Mohawk Urban Renewal project. North Market remains, the only one of four public markets left in the city. Attributes Central Street Market operating outside Central Market, 1939 The third, longest- lasting market was located on the west side of Fourth Street, between Town and Rich Streets, the current site of Columbus's Greyhound bus station. The first Central Market was a small building built of wood, 50 feet long. The second was larger, and had two stories. The third Central Market building, again two stories, was built of brick, had a central bell tower, and was 388 feet long and 37 feet wide. It had stalls for fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, and flowers. Farmers would arrive to set up stalls around 3-4 a.m., and the market's opening bell would ring at 6 a.m. Early meats sold here included squirrels, pigeons, doves, quail, and rabbits. Produce included peaches, pears, qinces, apples, blackberries, and cherries. Apple cider was sold at 5-7 cents per gallon. The building's second floor housed City Hall, including a council chamber and courtroom, with two neighboring jail cells and a guard room. Individual rooms held the offices of the mayor, city marshal, clerk, and surveyor. The building's 1930 remodel added the Tudor Revival half-timber trim commonly associated with the building. Central Market was surrounded on four sides and surrounding sidewalks with sheds and horse-drawn stands for farm stalls, selling the agricultural products that were an important part of Central Ohio's economy at the time. History Artist's conception of the first Central Market The first Central Market was located on High Street, south of Rich Street, built in 1814 and operated for two years. In 1817, Columbus City Council had a new market built on State Street, just west of High Street. Years later, the building was sold to John Young for use as the city's first gaming and pool hall. The city then purchased the third market building's land for $2,000, and constructed the building from 1849‚Äì50. The new space was desirable given its large amount of space for parking. The market building was designed with its second floor as the first official and permanent City Hall; before this there was no official space for the mayor and city council to meet. The state constitution, rewritten in 1850, created more power and duties for city mayors, also creating a need for a more formal space. Lorenzo English was the first mayor to take on these duties and operate from this new City Hall. In 1872, a new City Hall was dedicated on Capitol Square, removing the municipal functions of Central Market to the new building. Central Market in 1898 In 1930, the market was remodeled by Thomas Tully, with new dormers, half-timber trim, new roof lines, and heating and refrigeration installed. The market was thriving into the 1950s, as much of the population lacked refrigeration and needed to purchase smaller quantities of food more often. At its height, the market drew in 20,000 people on Saturdays and had 65 meat vendors. In 1950, the market celebrated its centennial; Governor Jim Rhodes stated it would not be redeveloped, as it had significant historic value. By the 1960s, as urban renewal became popular, and as the market was in need of repair, with tenants declining, Mayor James Sensenbrenner led the effort to remove it. One city councilman and several preservationists fought to save it for six years. City Council would indecisively revive and eliminate the market in sequential meetings. The market in the mid-20th century with its post-1930 half-timber trim The market was sold from the city to United Redevelopment Corp. as part of the Market- Mohawk Urban Renewal project. Many of the market's merchants moved to the then nearly empty North Market.https://www.dispatch.com/news/20170412/did-you-know- history-of-north-market On June 9, 1966, its demolition was scheduled, after a judge refused to spare the market. Merchants still operated out of the space into the last weeks of it standing. The demolition was complete by June 21, leaving only bricks and timbers. The closure of Central Market made North Market the sole remaining public market in the city. East Market stood on Mount Vernon and Miami Avenues from 1892 to 1947, while the West Market was built on Gift Street in Franklinton in 1889, and still stands, having been converted to a Boys and Girls Club in 1926.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1979: * A ruptured 2-inch gas line leaking caused a home to explode in Spokane, Washington on January 6, killing the homeowner. * On January 16, an explosion and fire destroyed five commercial buildings and damaged several other buildings in London, Kentucky. Two persons were injured. External corrosion was suspected as the cause. A prearranged pressure increase in the pipeline was also a factor. * On January 18 in Hocking County, Ohio a high pressure pipeline ruptured, killing a line repairman, and a supervisor. 6 other line repairman were also seriously injured. * On February 7, a Colonial Pipeline stubline ruptured in Hamilton, Tennessee, spilling about 152,000 gallons of petroleum product. The cause was from improper backfill of soil around the pipeline during its construction. * On March 2, at Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, Pump Station #6 located near the Yukon River in Alaska, the topping unit producing turbine fuel experienced a flame out of the flare stack which burns flammable tail gas from the unit. Automatic ignition apparatus did not function due to the extreme low temperature of -25F. A safety professional on staff was tasked with climbing the stack and re-igniting the flare manually. Once ignition was established, and before the safety professional could climb down from the top catwalk platform, station management ordered the combustion blower to be turned on and tail gas pressure to be increased from 3psi to 11psi. The action resulted in a surge through the knock out drum at the base of the stack, causing residual oil and naphtha to be blown up the stack, covering the top catwalk and approximately the top 60 feet of the stack in burning petroleum. The safety professional was severely burned and fell through the stack main access ladder components and iron work 115 feet to the ground. The occurrence did not result in a fatality, however, fire damaged the stack and petroleum contaminated the surrounding base area. * An 18-inch natural gas transmission pipeline failed underneath the Florida Turnpike in West Palm Beach, Florida, resulting in a 2-hour road closure. * On April 18, a 24-inch natural gas transmission pipeline pulled out of a compression coupling, during a line-lowering project under Iowa State Highway 181, in a rural area, near Dallas, Iowa. Within seconds, the natural gas ignited and burned a by area. Two cars, a pickup truck, and a trailer housing construction equipment were destroyed. A backhoe was damaged and windows were broken in a nearby farmhouse. Five of the eight injured workers were hospitalized. The gas company's accident records indicated that this 24-inch pipeline had experienced 12 previous failures since it was constructed. * On April 20, a series of explosions, and a fire, struck a Sunoco pipeline terminal in Toledo, Ohio. Some nearby residents fled their homes, and telephone service was disrupted. * On May 11, 2 explosions, and a following fire, killed 7 people, injured 19 others, and destroyed 3 buildings, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Soil erosion under an 8-inch cast iron gas main caused the main to break and release gas. * On May 13, a 36-inch Colonial Pipeline ruptured, releasing of fuel oil that damaged vegetation, and killed fish, near Spartanburg, South Carolina. Cracks made in the railroad shipping of the pipe before installation were the cause. * On May 19, tank truck drivers waiting at an Amoco terminal heard a bang, then saw a 3-foot side stream of gasoline pour down a nearby hillside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Train traffic on 2 nearby rail lines had to be stopped during the cleanup. * A \\"spud\\" dropped by a pile driving barge in the Gulf of Mexico near Pilottown, Louisiana ruptured a 4-inch natural gas pipeline on June 5. The escaping gas ignited, and seriously burned the barge. 4 crew members went missing and were presumed dead. * On June 10, the pilot of a helicopter reported sighting oil on the surface of the Atigun River near the route of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System's 48-inch crude oil pipeline. Repair crews found a 7-inch crack which passed through a longitudinal weld. Five days after the first leak, at 3:15 p.m. on June 15, the pilot of an Alyeska helicopter on a routine surveillance flight reported a leak north of pump station No. 12 near the Little Tonsina River. A crack near a wrinkle in the pipe was found there. The June 10 spill resulted in a release of approximately of crude oil; the June 15 leak resulted in a release of approximately of crude oil; these losses were estimated by Alyeska personnel at the leak site. The spills were too small to be verified by the Alyeska metering system. * A crack in a wrinkled section of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pipeline occurred at Pump Station 12 on June 15 on the south end of that pipeline in southern Alaska. About 1,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled. * On June 16, operator error at Colonial Pipeline caused a prior to installation rail shipping induced crack of 36-inch pipeline to rupture in Greenville County, South Carolina. 395,000 gallons of fuel oil were spilled, causing vegetation, fish, & wildlife kills. * A leaking pipeline released gasoline in Granger, Indiana, causing the evacuation of 400 people on July 3. * An anchor handling boat, PETE TIDE II, damaged an unmarked gas pipeline with a grappling hook offshore from New Orleans, Louisiana. Two of the crew were missing and presumed dead in the fire that followed. (July 15, 1979) * On July 25, an explosion and fire destroyed a duplex apartment house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Two persons were killed, and two persons were hospitalized for burns; adjacent houses were damaged. Earlier in the day, a crew from Mountain Bell Telephone Company (Mountain Bell) had been using a backhoe at the intersection of Bridge Boulevard and Atrisco Road to locate a telephone cable. The backhoe snagged a gas service line but the fact that it was pulled from a 1-inch coupling under the house was not discovered at that time. * A 34-inch Lakehead (now Enbridge) pipeline ruptured near Bemidji, Minnesota, leaking of crude oil on August 20. The pipeline company initially recovered 60 percent of the spilled oil. Later in 1988, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency required Lakehead to extract more oil using new technology; removal continued on, with studies still underway in the area. * On August 20, a bulldozer operating near Orange, Texas, was being used to clean a farm drainage ditch. The corner of the blade cut into a propane line, which crossed beneath the ditch. Propane at 350 psig escaped and was ignited within seconds. The resulting fire killed one person, injured another, and caused considerable property damage. * A crude oil pipeline ruptured and spilled oil into a creek new Walnut Grove, Missouri on August 25. of the creek were contaminated, and 32,000 fish killed. * On September 4, the M/V WHITEFACE struck a high-pressure gas pipeline on Lake Verret, near Pierre Part, Louisiana. A resulting explosion killed a crewman aboard the vessel. * On October 6, an explosion caused by liquefied natural gas (LNG) vapors destroyed a transformer building at the reception facility of the Columbia LNG Corporation, Cove Point, Maryland. Odorless liquefied natural gas leaked through an inadequately tightened LNG pump seal, vaporized, passed through approximately of underground electrical conduit and entered the substation building. One person was killed, and one person was seriously injured. Damage to the facility was estimated at about $3 million. The fire hydrants and deluge water spray system were inoperable after the explosion because the water main that supplied the system was broken at a flange above ground inside the substation. * On October 24, an explosion and fire destroyed the county clerk's office building and the adjoining courthouse building, gutted a connecting building which was under construction, and damaged the adjacent houses in Stanardsville, Virginia. Thirteen persons were injured and property was damaged extensively. The following NTSB investigation revealed that natural gas had leaked from a break in a 1 1/4-inch coated steel service line, which had been snagged by a backhoe which was being used to dig a footing for an addition to the county clerk's office building. * On October 30, a natural gas explosion and fire demolished a townhouse in Washington, D.C., and damaged nearby buildings and cars. No one was inside the townhouse at the time, but three persons in a stopped car were injured when debris from the explosion shattered a car window. After the accident, an inspection of the gas service line that served the townhouse revealed that it had been struck by excavating equipment. * On November 8, a pipeline contractor's ditching machine hit a 4-inch propane gathering line, in Sterling City, Texas. Propane under 500 psi escaped. Three hours later, a superintendent of the contractor attempted to start his pick up truck, located 650 feet from the leak. The starter of the truck ignited the propane, and the superintendent was severely burned, dying 40 days later. About 64,000 gallons of propane were lost or burned. No maps of the location of the pipeline ruptured were given to the contractor. * A natural gas transmission pipeline exploded in West Monroe, Louisiana on November 11, causing 3 subdivisions to be evacuated, and creating a crater 70 feet wide and 20 feet deep. There were no injuries. A gas pipeline explosion had taken place nearby 8 years before. * A 12-inch Amoco pipeline broke on December 11, near Waverly, Missouri, spilling about 8,400 gallons of crude oil. Temperature changes were blamed for the joint failure on the pipeline. * On December 16, military police at Marine Corps Base Quantico discovered fuel oil leaking into the Potomac River, near Chopawamsic Island. A leaking Plantation Pipeline 12 inch pipeline was the source, spilling between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons of fuel oil.

Search and optimization  Many problems in AI can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:Search algorithms:  * Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.Forward chaining, backward chaining, Horn clauses, and logical deduction as search:  * Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.State space search and planning:  Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.Moving and configuration space: * Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization. Simple exhaustive searchesUninformed searches (breadth first search, depth first search and general state space search):  * are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \\"heuristics\\" or \\"rules of thumb\\" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called \\"pruning the search tree\\"). Heuristics supply the program with a \\"best guess\\" for the path on which the solution lies.Heuristic or informed searches (e.g., greedy best first and A*): * , * , * , * , Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size. A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.Optimization searches:  particle swarm seeking the global minimum Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.Genetic programming and genetic algorithms: * , * .* Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).Artificial life and society based learning: *  Logic  LogicLogic: * , * , * is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planningSatplan: * , * , * and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.Explanation based learning, relevance based learning, inductive logic programming, case based reasoning: * , * , * , * Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logicPropositional logic: * , * * involves truth functions such as \\"or\\" and \\"not\\". First-order logicFirst-order logic and features such as equality: * , * , * , * adds quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy set theory assigns a \\"degree of truth\\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \\"Alice is old\\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. Fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \\"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy- logic inferences.Fuzzy logic: * Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscriptionDefault reasoning and default logic, non-monotonic logics, circumscription, closed world assumption, abduction (Poole et al. places abduction under \\"default reasoning\\". Luger et al. places this under \\"uncertain reasoning\\"): * , * , * , * are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics;Representing categories and relations: Semantic networks, description logics, inheritance (including frames and scripts): * , * , * , * situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);Representing events and time:Situation calculus, event calculus, fluent calculus (including solving the frame problem): * , * , * causal calculus;Causal calculus: * belief calculus (belief revision);\\"The Belief Calculus and Uncertain Reasoning\\", Yen-Teh Hsia and modal logics.Representing knowledge about knowledge: Belief calculus, modal logics: * , * Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.  Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning  Expectation-maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning: * , * , * , * Bayesian networksBayesian networks: * , * , * , * are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),Bayesian inference algorithm: * , * , * , * learning (using the expectation- maximization algorithm),Bayesian learning and the expectation-maximization algorithm: * , * , * planning (using decision networks)Bayesian decision theory and Bayesian decision networks: * and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).Stochastic temporal models: * Dynamic Bayesian networks: * Hidden Markov model: * Kalman filters: * Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \\"loops\\" (undirected cycles) can require a sophisticated method such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on Xbox Live to rate and match players; wins and losses are \\"evidence\\" of how good a player is. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve. A key concept from the science of economics is \\"utility\\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, decision theory and decision analysis: * , * and information value theory.Information value theory: * These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks: * dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.Game theory and mechanism design: *  Classifiers and statistical learning methods  The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\\"if shiny then diamond\\") and controllers (\\"if shiny then pick up\\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.Statistical learning methods and classifiers: * , * A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches. The decision treeDecision tree: * , * , * is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm. Other widely used classifiers are the neural network,Neural networks and connectionism: * , * , * , * k-nearest neighbor algorithm,K-nearest neighbor algorithm: * kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM),kernel methods such as the support vector machine: * Gaussian mixture model,Gaussian mixture model: * and the extremely popular naive Bayes classifier.Naive Bayes classifier: * Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \\"naive Bayes\\" on most practical data sets.  Artificial neural networks  neurons in the human brain. Neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \\"neuron\\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \\"fired\\"), casts a weighted \\"vote\\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \\"fire together, wire together\\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \\"concepts\\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \\"leg\\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \\"foot\\" that includes the sound for \\"foot\\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car. In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A; in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015. The study of non-learning artificial neural networks began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of Walter Pitts and Warren McCullouch. Frank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of linear regression. Early pioneers also include Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, Teuvo Kohonen, Stephen Grossberg, Kunihiko Fukushima, Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, Shun-Ichi Amari, Bernard Widrow, John Hopfield, Eduardo R. Caianiello, and others. The main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.Feedforward neural networks, perceptrons and radial basis networks: * * Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning (\\"fire together, wire together\\"), GMDH or competitive learning.Competitive learning, Hebbian coincidence learning, Hopfield networks and attractor networks: * Today, neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm, which has been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa,Seppo Linnainmaa (1970).

Online Backpropagation: * , * , * Hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. To summarize, most neural networks use some form of gradient descent on a hand- created neural topology. However, some research groups, such as Uber, argue that simple neuroevolution to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches. One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in \\"dead ends\\".  Deep feedforward neural networks  Deep learning is the use of artificial neural networks which have several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. Deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and others.Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016). Deep Learning. MIT Press. Online According to one overview, the expression \\"Deep Learning\\" was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986Rina Dechter (1986). Learning while searching in constraint-satisfaction problems. University of California, Computer Science Department, Cognitive Systems Laboratory.Online and gained traction after Igor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in 2000.Igor Aizenberg, Naum N. Aizenberg, Joos P.L. Vandewalle (2000). Multi-Valued and Universal Binary Neurons: Theory, Learning and Applications. Springer Science & Business Media. The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965. These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. In 1989, Yann LeCun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application, CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.Yann LeCun (2016). Slides on Deep Learning Online Since 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have won many visual pattern recognition competitions. CNNs with 12 convolutional layers were used with reinforcement learning by Deepmind's \\"AlphaGo Lee\\", the program that beat a top Go champion in 2016.  Deep recurrent neural networks  Early on, deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Recurrent neural networks, Hopfield nets: * * which are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence; thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning. RNNs can be trained by gradient descentP. J. Werbos.

Informatik, Technische Univ. Munich. Advisor: J. Schmidhuber. In 1992, it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems. Numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997.Hochreiter, Sepp; and Schmidhuber, J√ºrgen; Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9(8):1735‚Äì1780, 1997 LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC).Alex Graves, Santiago Fernandez, Faustino Gomez, and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber (2006). Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural nets. Proceedings of ICML'06, pp. 369‚Äì376. At Google, Microsoft and Baidu this approach has revolutionized speech recognition.Hasim Sak and Andrew Senior and Francoise Beaufays (2014). Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network architectures for large scale acoustic modeling. Proceedings of Interspeech 2014. For example, in 2015, Google's speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through Google Voice to billions of smartphone users.Ha≈üim Sak, Andrew Senior, Kanishka Rao, Fran√ßoise Beaufays and Johan Schalkwyk (September 2015): Google voice search: faster and more accurate. Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation, Language Modeling and Multilingual Language Processing. LSTM combined with CNNs also improved automatic image captioning and a plethora of other applications.  Evaluating progress  AI, like electricity or the steam engine, is a general purpose technology. There is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks AI tends to excel at. While projects such as AlphaZero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch, many other machine learning projects require large training datasets. Researcher Andrew Ng has suggested, as a \\"highly imperfect rule of thumb\\", that \\"almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.\\" Moravec's paradox suggests that AI lags humans at many tasks that the human brain has specifically evolved to perform well. Games provide a well-publicized benchmark for assessing rates of progress. AlphaGo around 2016 brought the era of classical board-game benchmarks to a close. Games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to AI in game theory. E-sports such as StarCraft continue to provide additional public benchmarks. Many competitions and prizes, such as the Imagenet Challenge, promote research in artificial intelligence. The most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, robotic cars, and robot soccer as well as conventional games. The \\"imitation game\\" (an interpretation of the 1950 Turing test that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human) is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark. A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. Unlike the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer. Proposed \\"universal intelligence\\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible. At an extreme, the test suite can contain every possible problem, weighted by Kolmogorov complexity; unfortunately, these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern-matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels.  Hardware improvements  Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large- scale commercial cloud AI. OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.

Gagliardo was referred to as the \\"Kansas Book Lady\\" for her efforts in promoting books and advocating for resources for teachers and parents. She held several prominent leadership roles in national organizations, including serving as the vice president of the National Parent Teacher Association and as president of the Association for Library Service to Children. Gagliardo's creation of a traveling book exhibit is credited with the start of book fairs in the United States. Early life and education Ruth Jane Garver was born in Hastings, Nebraska, on September 6, 1895. Her father, a traveling minister, died before her birth; her mother remarried when Ruth was seven and the family moved to Topeka, Kansas in 1910. Her mother inspired a love of literature in her and her brother and Ruth collected children's books as a young girl. In 1914, she graduated from Topeka High School, after serving as the school yearbook's editor-in-chief. After being trained to teach at a normal school, she taught at several rural schools. She developed the library of Culver High School, leading to its accreditation; since Garver didn't have a teaching certificate, she could no longer continue working at the school. She began her undergraduate degree at the University of Kansas in 1918, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English in 1922. Career After graduating from the University of Kansas, Gagliardo went to work as a reporter for the Emporia Gazette. In this role she also acted as a part-time personal secretary for editor William Allen White; White talked with many writers and politicians, ensuring that Gagliardo met them all. She covered art, music, and book events and devoted many columns to children's books, which made the Gazette one of the first newspapers to regularly review children's books. Gagliardo moved to Lawrence in 1925, becoming a freelance writer and raising her three children with her husband, Domenico Gagliardo. She maintained her close relationship with William Allen White, and when White died in 1944, she began efforts to start an award to honor him. The William Allen White Children's Book Award is awarded by a vote of Kansas schoolchildren; it was the first statewide children's choice book award established in the United States. In 1942 Gagliardo volunteered to write a book review column for the Kansas Teacher, an educational journal published by the Kansas State Teachers Association. The column ran for twenty-five years. She traveled throughout the state, bringing an exhibit of selected books to schools and libraries. Gagliardo's creation, the Kansas Children's Traveling Book Exhibit, is credited with beginning book fairs in the U.S. Her enthusiastic talks while touring with the 700 books often led to school officials committing to provide more funding for books. Gagliardo became a paid employee of the Kansas State Teachers Association in 1947, becoming the director of library services. Gagliardo became known as the \\"Kansas Book Lady\\" because of her tireless promotion of books through multiple venues, including speeches, newspaper and journal columns, and book reviews. From 1947 to 1955 she ran a monthly radio program focusing on books for the University of Kansas. She worked with many organizations to start book and reading programs, including UNESCO and the U.S. Department of State. Gagliardo was active in multiple professional organizations; some of her most significant roles were serving as the vice president for the National Parent Teacher Association as well as director of the National Parent-Teacher Magazine. She was very active in the American Library Association, chairing the Newbery and Caldecott Committee in 1962 and the following year serving as the president of the ALA's Children's Services Division (now called the Association for Library Service to Children). In 1960 she testified before the U.S. Congress as a witness arguing for the extension of the Library Services Act, saying the funding provided to libraries was \\"a means of equalizing opportunity for all children\\". She also served as the state representative for Kansas at the White House Conference on Children and Youth in 1950 and 1960. Her 1962 anthology Let's read aloud focused on the importance of families reading together. Gagliardo retired in 1966. Death and legacy In 1967, Gagliardo received a Distinguished Service Citation from the University of Kansas. She was inducted into the National Education Association Hall of Fame for American Women in 1976. Gagliardo died in Wichita, Kansas on January 5, 1980. After her death, author Mary Francis Shura discussed Gagliardo's legacy: Since 1964 the Ruth Garver Gagliardo School Library Scholarship has been awarded annually to a masters student by the Kansas Association of School Librarians.

Early life and education Willoughby was born on November 26, 1955. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from the University of Western Ontario before enrolling at the University of Waterloo for her Master's degree and PhD. Career Upon receiving her PhD, Willoughby joined the department of psychology at Brock University in 1995. As an assistant professor, she co-led a research project with Linda Rose-Krasnor aimed at studying children's language and literacy skills. The following year, Willoughby was appointed the inaugural director of the Brock Research Institute for Youth Studies (BRIYS) and received over $4 million in research funding to study youth development. As a result of her knowledge of yourh development, Willoughby and Eileen Wood were asked to co-edit Anastasia Goodstein's media education resource Totally Wired in 2008. She also received Brock's inaugural Graduate Mentorship Award in 2011. Beginning in 2011, Willoughby started to study the long term effects video games had on childhood development. She co-authored a lab-controlled study with Paul J. C. Adachi titled The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence? The study followed 42 college students as they played Conan Exiles, a violent game, or Fuel, a competitive game, for 12 minutes. They concluded that competitiveness, not violence, in video games may influence aggressive behavior. She collaborated with Adachi again in 2013 to complete a longitudinal, self-report study covering 1,771 high school students over four years. The paper, titled Demolishing the Competition: The Longitudinal Link Between Competitive Video Games, Competitive Gambling, and Aggression, re-affirmed their previous studies results that competition results in aggressive behavior, not violence. Encouraged by their findings, Adachi and Willoughby began to study the effects sports video games had on youth behavior. They found that youths who played sports video games were more likely to join them in real life. As a result of Willoughby's research, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research granted her $1.43 million to study youth risk-taking in 2016.

Geography Jiangjunmiao is located in the Junggar Basin near the border with Mongolia, on a mesa and at the top of an alluvial slope. There is a single dirt road which connects the ruins to the nearby city of Qitai, and the √úr√ºmqi‚ÄìDzungaria railway connects the site to Zhundong but offers no passenger service. The closest inhabited area is a remote nature park maintained by the county government which hosts the area's petrified forest. The area around the ruins is known as the \\"Jiangjun Gobi\\" in reference to the ruin. The site is located only from one of the 45√ó90 points, four sites on Earth located exactly between a geographical pole (the North Pole) and the Equator, as well as the Prime Meridian and International Date Line. Jiangjunmiao is the closest named location to the 45x90 point where the 45th parallel north and 90th meridian east converge. Temperatures in the area can reach in the summer months as westward winds blow hot air in from the Gobi Desert. History Jiangjunmiao was originally established as a temple memorializing Yangxigu, a Tang dynasty general who led an army against Turkic nomads in defence of the Silk Road and served as the yushidafu of the Beiting Protectorate around 789. According to legend, the army was successful in securing the area but while returning eastward all of the soldiers died of dehydration passing through the desert; Yangxigu and his men were buried where they were found, and Jiangjunmiao (\\"General Temple\\") was established at the burial site. Jiangjunmiao was abandoned some time during the 19th or 20th century. A number of structures including a wooden inn remained standing when palaeontologist Zhao Xijin visited the ruins in 1981, and by 2004 the only remaining structures in the village were a series of damaged mud walls. Geology=Coal mining Jiangjunmiao lends its name to the Jiangjunmiao mining area, which is part of the East Junggar coalfield. The average thickness of coal seams at and around Jiangjunmiao is . Palaeontology Monolophosaurus jiangi, discovered at and named for Jiangjunmiao Jiangjunmiao serves as a locality of the Shishugou Formation, a Late Jurassic formation. Beginning in 1981, Jiangjunmiao has served as an important palaeontological dig site and many dinosaur fossils have been discovered in the area, though the earliest finds date back to 1927 when Tienshanosaurus was discovered by Yuan Fu. The holotype specimens of Monolophosaurus and Sinraptor were discovered in the vicinity by researchers from the China-Canada Dinosaur Project. Fossils of Mamenchisaurus have also been found at the site. Before its name was finalized, Monolophosaurus was known alternatively as \\"Jiangjunmiaosaurus\\" and \\"Monolophosaurus jiangjunmiaoi\\" in reference to the ruins where it was found. Jiangjunosaurus was named in 2007 in reference to Jiangjunmiao. Various institutions have participated in digs at Jiangjunmiao including George Washington University, the Guangdong Museum, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Northern Arizona University, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.

Characters ; :A first-year high school student, Ayumu is a member of the shogi club. In love with Urushi Yaotome, he has vowed that will not confess his feelings until he beat her at the shogi. However, the relationship between the two has not progressed because he has never won. When he was a middle school student, he belonged to the kendo club, and his tactics to break through his opponent's defense were excellent, so his reputation in the club was high. Even in shogi, his defense tactics have become more prominent, but Urushi continues to read his moves. ; :A second-year student, Urushi is Ayumu's senpai in the shogi club.

He was long obscure, not being mentioned in any music dictionaries until 1989, but a 2019 world premiere recording of some his important piano works has gained him positive critical notice. Referring to the 20 Preludes, Op. 12, one commentator wrote: \\"As a listener, what stands out is how well-crafted and delightful these little works are ... how on earth it is that they only now have their world premiere recording?\\"Corymbus Career Barmotin was born in Saint Petersburg. His father was from Tambov peasant stock who had served in a grenadier regiment at the Imperial Palace. Barmotin's musical gifts were apparent from an early age, and his mother arranged for him to be taught by Mily Balakirev, who was then Director of the Imperial Chapel. He then studied composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov 1899‚Äì1901. He himself taught at the Imperial Chapel before going to teach at a school in Kherson, and then privately on his return to Saint Petersburg. From 1919-23 he was director of choral singing for the Baltic fleet, and 1923-25 taught at his alma mater, now known as the Petrograd Conservatory.Grand Piano RecordsShort biography (Russian) Barmotin is not mentioned in the main Western music dictionaries. Only in 1989 did he gain an entry in the Biographical Dictionary of Russian/Soviet Composers published in the United States,Records International but that provides only sparse and incomplete information. Death Barmotin's obscurity extended even to the details of his death. The date and circumstances of his death were unknown for many decades, which led some commentators to speculate that he suffered a dire fate at the hands of the Soviet regime in the 1930s. It was only in recent times that his death date of 5 April 1939 was established, based on a hand-written obituary found in the Saint Petersburg City Archives; but the place and circumstances of his death are still unknown.Naxos Records Works Much of Barmotin's music is for solo piano, including a Sonata in G-flat, 20 Preludes, Theme and Variations, suites and miscellaneous pieces. He also wrote three operas (one for children), a Violin Sonata, a Po√®me symphonique for orchestra, Hymn to Comrade Stalin, and October Victory, a march-cantata to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. Most of his work was published by such important houses as Mitrofan Belyayev and P. Jurgenson.

Early life  Radjamin Purba was born on 22 December 1928, on a small village named Bangunpurba, which was located in Haranggaol, Simalungun. He was born as the son of the couple Djaingon Purba and Rosmainta Saragih.  Military career  During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Purba worked as an employee in the government's office on Pematangsiantar. Following the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Purba resigned from his job and entered the fledgling armed forces of Indonesia with the rank of first lieutenant. A year later, in 1946, Purba was sent on a trip to study at the Military Academy in Jogjakarta. Two year later, he graduated from the academy, and became the member of a program to reduce the size of the army by retaining only professional soldiers. On November 1949, Purba became a liaison officer for Sumatran affairs in Jogjakarta. At the same time, he was also appointed as the member of the Central Joint Board for prisoner of war affairs. After the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, Purba was appointed as a military officer which handled personalia affairs. Following the implementation of the Re-Ra policy (Reorganization and Rationalization), Purba was demoted to Second Lieutenant in 1951. He was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1953 when he enrolled in the Military Law Academy. He graduated from the academy in 1956 with the rank of Captain and a law degree. He moved to Sumatra, and became a staff in the Regional War Authority of North Sumatra.  Regent of Simalungun = Inauguration  On 15 July 1960, Radjamin Purba was inaugurated as the Regent of Simalungun by Raja Junjungan Lubis, the Governor of North Sumatra at that time. His term was intended to end in 1966, but due to the crisis caused by the 30 September Movement, his term was extended until 1967. By the mid-1967, an election for the new Regent was held by the Regional People's Representative Council of Simalungun. The council unanimously voted for Radjamin Purba to serve his second term. Purba was inaugurated on 26 August 1967 by Marah Halim Harahap.

On February 1973, Purba's second term ended, and he was replaced by Colonel T.P.R. Purba. He moved to Jakarta, where he became the Inspector of the Headquarters for the Ministry of Internal Affairs. During an interview conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Mailan Damti Purba, Radjamin Purba stated that he wanted to dedicate his retirement life for the development of the Simalungun University. At 03.00 on 16 February 1977, Radjamin Purba died in Jakarta after suffering a heart attack following his trip from Bandung. The news of his death quickly spread to Simalungun. The members of the Partuha Maujana gathered and requested the central government in Jakarta to bury Radjamin Purba's body in Pematangsiantar. The central government refused to fulfill the request and buried him at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. The burial ceremony was done on 17 February 1977, and Radjamin Purba was posthumously promoted from Colonel to Brigadier General.  Legacy  A street in Simalungun is named after Radjamin Purba. A sports venue constructed in 2002 in Simalungun is named after him. A full body statue of Radjamin Purba is erected in the Simalungun University. The statue was inaugurated by Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia Mahfud MD on 18 May 2012. The Simalungun University named one of the halls of the university as the Radjamin Purba Hall. The hall was inaugurated on April 1984 by Purba's wife.  Personal life  Purba was married to Nana Kencana, a West Javanese aristocrat, in 1958. The marriage resulted in six children, namely Budi Raja Manggala, Darmayanti, Pandu, Suhaerani, Kurniaty, and Adi Rajadiningrat. Purba was a Protestant Christian.

Collection of the British Library. In the political history of Britain, placemen were Members of Parliament who held paid office in the civil service, generally sinecures, simultaneously with their seat in the legislature.  William and Mary  Placemen exerted substantial influence over legislation during the reign of William III and Mary II, who jointly acceded to the throne following the Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì89. Estimates of the number of placemen in Parliament during the 1690s vary, but the consensus among contemporary chroniclers converges around 100 or so (with a few outliers among government critics such as Samuel Grascome, who put the number far higher). As of 1690, William's court adopted an explicit policy directing placemen‚Äîwho, at that time, included customs officers as well as others with 'Pentions' or 'other Advantages' provided by royal largesse‚Äîto advance the Crown's interest in Parliament, particularly as regards voting supply. Rubini notes that this is not surprising, as placemen 'received some of what they voted as their reward'. A 1692 bill, which failed to pass, would have shortened the length of parliaments and banned officeholders from serving in Parliament. John Granville, apparently recalling the Self-denying Ordinance of 1645, called it a 'self-denying bill' in debate. An anonymous pamphleteer writing in 1698 about the selection of a speaker expresses exasperation with the 'well paid Forces' of the Crown as compared to the 'undisciplin'd Militia' of the country party: > 'Tis true, the ablest General alone, and without Troops, is insignificant: > But when regulated and well paid Forces have a bold and skilful Leader at > their Head, they must conquer; especially if those they encounter be an > undisciplin'd Militia just brought out of their several Counties. In many cases, placemen under William III exercised their control over Parliament simply by showing up: attendance at legislative sessions during William's reign was generally low, so a bloc determined to vote could pass its favoured measures by default. A provision included in a draft version of the Act of Settlement 1701 would have banned all placemen from serving in Parliament, but the language was ultimately omitted.

Its main purpose is to celebrate and preserve the history of the timber industry in the South Waikato District with which it has had a connection dating back to the 1900s.  History  Frank Sneddon, a former editor of the Putaruru Press, visited a small roadside timber museum on Vancouver Island, Canada, and on his return to New Zealand he suggested the establishment of a timber museum. Because of Putaruru's long association with the timber industry, Sneddon felt the town would be the ideal place to set up a museum. A public meeting was held on 4 May 1972 to gauge interest and the Timber Museum Society was subsequently formed. The Putaruru Jaycees were involved in the early stages and initially planned that the museum would be sited on the Putaruru Domain although this did not eventuate. Instead the Society took a 10-year lease commencing in 1974 of the P.T.Y. (Putararu Timber Industries Ltd) No 2 Mill for 10c per annum. This Mill, built in the 1940s was previously owned by Tuck and Watkins Ltd. Extremely rundown, the mill had to be virtually rebuilt by the Society for its purposes. In 1977, the Taupo Totara Timber (TTT) Company Mill was moved on site. The restored Tuck and Watkins Mill and the TTT Order Office were opened to the public in September 1981. The Cookhouse Cafe was opened in 1982. In 2007, the New Zealand Timber Museum took over the running of the site from the Society and in July 2007 presented a three-stage development plan to the South Waikato District Council. By 2010, Stage Two of the Trust's plans had been completed. The International Order of Hoo-Hoo is a timber industry \\"variety club\\" that was founded in the US in 1892 to foster activities that would benefit the industry and humanity. Members of the International Order attended the opening of a Hoo-Hoo club room at the Museum in April 2019. The room is located in the Sycamore Conference and Function Centre, named after life member of the Putaruru Museum Society, Cam Sycamore..  Collections  The museum holds a large number of unique exhibits and historical archives, including * photographic archives of local history from the early 20th century * wood craft from local and national artists * a number of restored historical buildings onsite * a local geology display * items relating to the timber industry in the local region from early European settlement * a display of native birds by the taxidermist Jane Yandle * a 200-year-old matai log  Buildings  The museum is the repository of several historic buildings that have been restored and which house several of the museum's collections.

The poem was later published by Raduga Publishers in 1923 and is regarded as a cultural poetic heritage among Russophones. It is based on an overgrown cockroach who assumed power over mankind and animals by bullying and threatening them, only to fall prey to a sparrow in the end. There are still confusions and speculations among critics whether Chukovsky had former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin in his mind before compiling the poem.

Protests in Belarus broke out before and after disputed 2020 Belarusian presidential election and the moment calling for Slipper Revolution, also known as Anti-cockroach protests was initiated by businessman and blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky referring to the poem. He compared Lukashenko to the cockroach by referring to the poem. The demonstrators and protesters also called for killing the cockroach with a slipper indicating Lukashenko as the Cockroach in a metaphorical reference to the poem. In the original poem, the cockroach is eventually eaten by a sparrow, while Tikhanovsky refers to a slipper signifying stamping on the cockroach.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1030‚Äì1034 in its catalogues. Plot A magician, aided by his assistant and two women dressed as pages, constructs a large tambourine from two hoops and a piece of cloth. The magician paints a face on the head of the tambourine, and magically extracts wine bottles and clothing, including old-fashioned dresses, from the face. Multiplying the pages into four, the magician throws the dresses upon them, and they perform a brief dance. Next the magician takes the frame of the tambourine (now without its head), and, suspending it from wires, makes one of the women rise up from it. He then disappears into the frame himself, to the astonishment of his servant, before returning for a final trick: separating the frame back into two hoops, he turns them into the wheels of a bicycle, and rides cheerfully away.

Comporta is one of the most exclusive summer destinations in Europe, which has earned the region the nickname as \\"the Hamptons of Europe\\". The region, which takes its name from the village of Comporta, spans the coastal areas of the Alentejan municipalities of Alc√°cer do Sal and Gr√¢ndola. Comporta has become a notable design center and home to a community of famous designers and artists, including fashion designer Christian Louboutin, architect Philippe Stark, designer Pierre Yovanovitch, painter Jason Martin, amongst others. Comporta is associated with its so- called \\"Comporta Style\\" (Estilo Comporta in Portuguese), the local architectural and design style characterized by traditional Alentejan architecture, Bohemianism, and contemporary, ecological design. History Carvalhal. The history of the region of Comporta is intimately linked to the history of the Herdade da Comporta (\\"Estate of Comporta\\" in English), a massive agricultural estate formally constituted in 1836, with origins in the 12th century, which originally consisted of the majority of the land and villages in the modern region of Comporta, made up of the coastal areas of the Alc√°cer do Sal and Gr√¢ndola municipalities. The area has traditionally been home to salt works, fishing communities, and rice fields. In 1991, after more than 150 years of operating as a purely agricultural estate, famous for its rice production, the Herdade da Comporta was reconstituted to develop its vast properties into an exclusive summer destination oriented towards ultra high- net-worth individuals, centered on design and sustainability, while continuing to operate as an agricultural estate and as steward to the large swathes of protected natural land owned and managed by the Herdade. Initially, the Herdade attracted high-networth personalities to the area through personal connections with the Esp√≠rito Santo banking family, which owned the Herdade. During this time, the Esp√≠rito Santo family invited high profile celebrities as guests such as Prince Albert of Monaco and Princess Caroline of Hanover. Following the collapse of the Banco Esp√≠rito Santo in 2014, courts ordered that the Esp√≠rito Santo family put the Herdade up for sale. In 2019, Paula Amorim, heiress to Portugal's largest fortune, concluded the purchase of the Herdade. Geography Quinta da Comporta. Praia do Pego. Comporta is located in the northwestern coast of the Alentejo, about an hour south of Lisbon. The majority of land in the region is protected from development as a nature preserve, while a significant portion is protected for traditional agricultural uses, such as rice fields and salt ponds. Restrictive development regulations were installed purposefully by the Herdade da Comporta and the municipal governments to both preserve the natural landscape of the region and ensure its exclusivity. The region of Comporta is located within 3 freguesias (civil parishes) within the Alentejan municipalities of Alc√°cer do Sal and Gr√¢ndola: Comporta, Carvalhal, and Melides. The following towns and villages are located within the region: *Comporta (village) *Carrasqueira *Possanco *Cambado *Pego *Carvalhal *Brejos da Carragueira *Torre *Melides *Muda *Pinheirinho *Sesmarias Beaches *Praia da Comporta *Praia do Carvalhal *Praia do Pego *Praia dos Brejos *Praia da Raposa *Praia do Pinheirinho *Praia da Gal√© Culture The Cais Palaf√≠tico in Carrasqueira. The development of the region by the Herdade da Comporta into a high-end destination in the 1990s, under the leadership of the Esp√≠rito Santo banking family, intentionally sought to attract notable artists, designers, and celebrities to the area, with the aim of building an exclusive artistic community for the jet-set. Notable artists and designers that reside in the region include fashion designer Christian Louboutin, architect Philippe Starck, painter Jason Martin, and art curator Marc-Olivier Wahler, among others. Comporta hosted an edition of the Wings for Life World Run in 2014. Christian Louboutin shot his 2013 collection at the Cais Palaf√≠tico in Carrasqueira. British painter Jason Martin established two art studios in Comporta in 2018, one in the village of Melides and the other in the middle of a natural reserve within the Herdade da Comporta. Comporta style The Comporta style, sometimes known as \\"Hippie Chic\\", is a local architectural and design style, developed by various architects and designers since the 1990s. The style is heavily influenced by traditional vernacular architecture of the Alentejo, ecological design, and regional arts and artisanry. Typical motifs include thatched roofing, straw plaiting, and Arraiolos rugs. Notable residents Aerial view of the Comporta Coast.

Personal Kieser was the son of a pastor. He learned the goldsmith's trade. In the early summer of 1609, through his marriage with Anna Christina Hoffmann, a painter's daughter, he received citizen's rights in Frankfurt am Main, worked as a goldsmith in Sachsenhausen and began to draw and engrave. From 1612 he illustrated and published books and produced illustrative prints in his publishing workshop with several engravers as assistants. Work His most important work is a Dance of Death after Holbein, consisting of 60 small-format etchings from 1617. Kieser is also known for the Thesaurus philopoliticus (German title: Politisches Schatzk√§stlein guter Herren und bestendiger Freund), a collection of copperplate engravings with city views, which Kieser and Daniel Meisner (1585‚Äì1625), originally from Bohemia, produced and successfully published. These engravings appeared in 16 books with 831 city images until 1631. Each picture has a motto in Latin and German, written by Meisner.

Owned by Humboldt Greig alongside WHUM (1240 AM), the station‚ÄîReading's first‚Äîtelecast from 1953 to 1956. It boasted the first ever high-powered UHF transmission facility, which spurred industry interest but also caused some technical issues; the station ultimately suffered from many of the same economic problems that befell other early UHF television outlets. Establishment On August 7, General Electric announced that it would supply the equipment for the WHUM-TV facility in a contract worth $450,000. After a \\"frustrating\\" clerical error at the FCC‚Äîthe assignment of an unsuitable channel 55 to Reading, prompting both of Reading's TV applicants to file for channel 61, only for the other to choose channel 33‚Äîthat ended any hope of being the first station to air, WHUM-TV was granted its construction permit in the first week of September. From there, the eagerness of WHUM owner Humboldt J. Greig took over; he planned to have bulldozers on the site the date the permit was awarded. While KPTV in Portland, Oregon, would be first to air, WHUM-TV's launch was looked at with interest by the industry because of its superior technical facility, introduction of UHF into an existing VHF market, and the presence of community antenna television systems that would redistribute the signal. Greig promised the station would operate in the black financially. As construction proceeded, WHUM-TV traveled the region with a mobile unit, giving demonstrations of television; promotional materials hyped the coming of the \\"world's most powerful television station\\" and boasted that channel 61 would have more power than all the TV stations in New York and Philadelphia combined. State police were necessary to manage the crowds who witnessed the erection of the mast, billed as taller than the Eiffel Tower. Tower construction was completed at the start of December. After delays in getting the station's wave guide transmission line‚Äîused instead of coaxial cable to avoid excessive line loss on the tall tower‚Äîto work to specifications, test patterns went out on February 9 and the station began telecasting as a CBS network affiliate‚Äîmatching WHUM radio‚Äîon February 22, making it the 10th UHF television station to air. The station had easy access to network coaxial cable, which already ran a block away from its studios. WHUM-TV boasted one of the most impressive facilities in early UHF broadcasting and was described by Television Digest as \\"the first high-powered UHF station\\". The tower rose from atop a site on Blue Mountain near Summit Station, delivering a signal with an effective radiated power of 260,000 watts‚Äîthen the highest in use at any UHF facility. The studios and offices in Reading's Tower Hotel were furnished with two remotely controlled cameras. In addition, WHUM-TV had the use of two satellite studios in Pomeroy's department stores at Wilkes-Barre and Harrisburg. The high-power facility was effective at sending signal over a wide area. However, signal strength was often not as high in Reading proper, leading to poorer pictures. Dealers often struggled to install television sets and antennas that received satisfactory signals from channel 61, particularly in Reading; they also learned that terrain shielding was much more severe to UHF signals than VHF. In addition to CBS programming, WHUM-TV presented 30 hours of local and live programming a week. However, some of it was rather cheap: the station's cooking program was hosted by a woman who did not know how to cook and relied on cookbooks at the local public library to prepare her show. Additionally, the station aired sports programming from WPIX New York, part of a regional daisy-chain hookup of 10 stations. Six months after signing on, the station almost faced calamity when a small plane clipped one of the guy wires supporting the WHUM-TV tower. After striking the wire, the plane crashed and burst into flames; both occupants died. A second outlet joined WHUM-TV two months later, when WEEU-TV (channel 33) began telecasting with NBC and ABC programs. WEEU-TV closed on June 30, 1955; (also republished in Broadcasting, July 4, 1955, p. 37) WHUM-TV began airing some ABC programming after channel 33 folded. Closure As more viewers tuned to the more powerful‚Äîand VHF‚Äîsignals of Philadelphia's network stations, channel 61 suffered. A financial reorganization of Eastern Radio Corporation was carried out early in 1956, with founder Greig ceding the job of general manager to Robert C. Magee. In late August, the specter of additional competition arose when the commission approved a proposal to return WLBR-TV, channel 15 at Lebanon, to the air, under the ownership of Triangle Publications; WHUM-TV had joined three UHF outlets in the Harrisburg area in protesting the transaction. The final blow, however, came not from economic troubles, but from above. On the afternoon of September 4, 1956, a lightning bolt struck the WHUM-TV tower and caused what was described as \\"extensive\\" damage to the waveguide and antenna; two days later, channel 61 announced its closure would be for good. The station announced it would retain the construction permit but sell off the equipment to meet financial obligations. VHF service was maintained by five stations in the former WHUM-TV coverage area. The large mast remained in place until 1958, when it was dismantled after being declared a \\"menace to aviation\\".

Life and work Hamza was based in Aley in the Gharb area southeast of Beirut in Mount Lebanon. His father Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Salih (d. 1482) was a disciple of the reformist Druze religious leader al-Sayyid Abd Allah al- Tanukhi and the imam of his mosque in Abeih. Hamza was one of two sons of Shihab al-Din, the other being Zayn al-Din Abd al-Rahman (d. 1491). Like al- Sayyid al-Tanukhi and the Buhturid emirs of the Gharb, the Sibat family were descendants of the Tanukh, an Arab tribe which was long established in the Gharb. Part of his work chronicled the Tanukh's history, before and after their acceptance and propagation of the Druze doctrine in the early 11th century. Hamza chronicled the medieval history of Mount Lebanon. His work was largely based on the chronicle of the Buhturid chronicler Salih ibn Yahya (d. 1435). Ibn Sibat continued the history of Mount Lebanon for the rest of the 15th century through the first years of Ottoman rule, which began in 1516. For the history of his own time, he relied on his personal observations. He is a principal source for the history of the Druze Ma'n dynasty of the Chouf in the closing years of Mamluk rule in the 1490s through 1516 and the first interactions of the Ma'ns and the Buhturids with the Ottoman conquerors. The 17th-century Maronite historian and patriarch Istifan al-Duwayhi and the 19th- century Maronite historian Tannus al-Shidyaq depended mainly on Hamza's chronicle for their histories of non-Maronite Mount Lebanon.

The team raced with a close connection to Ferrari in various grand touring championships from 2004 to 2008. Coppi, formerly a sponsor and backer of the JB Racing (later JMB Racing) team through his Giesse corporation, decided to go his own direction in 2004 and launch his own racing team in the FIA GT Championship, later expanding to the Italian GT Championship, European Le Mans Series, and International GT Open. GPC Sport also represented Maserati in the FIA GT3 European Championship. History A Ferrari 360 GTC of GPC Sport in 2004 Purchasing two new Ferrari 575 GTCs as well as two Ferrari 360 GTCs, the team employed several former Grand Prix drivers including Emanuele Naspetti and Gianni Morbidelli. Christian Pescatori, Jaime Melo, and Fabrizio De Simone scored class victories with the 360s, while the 575s finished on the overall podium three times, including at the Spa 24 Hours, finishing second in the teams' championship. The operation was expanded for 2005, adding the Italian GT Championship alongside their FIA GT campaign with the 575s, as well as Le Mans Endurance Series and Italian GT for the teams' 360s. The FIA GT campaign earned only a single podium in each class after several retirements, while the Italian GT program had several programs throughout the season. For 2006 GPC Sport abandoned their 575 program with Ferrari, instead investing in the new Ferrari F430 in the Le Mans Series as well as the new International GT Open series. Two class victories were earned in the Le Mans Series, including the first competition victory for the F430, as well as two overall wins in International GT. GPC also represented Maserati in the new FIA GT3 European Championship with the Maserati Trofeo Light. More victories came in 2007, a lone win in the Le Mans Series as well as two more wins in International GT Open. GPC Sport also had their only entry at the 24 Hours of Le Mans where their Ferrari retired. The team also sampled stock car racing with the Speedcar Series. The team trimmed down to just two entries in International GT in 2008 but were not victorious. Giampaolo Coppi would later go on to managing the Roma Racing Team after GPC Sport went bankrupt in 2008.

In the decoration he made liberal use of the royal badges of King Henry VIII and his first wife Katherine of Aragon, thus displaying his loyalty to the Tudor dynasty.Mercer, p.163 Assists William Warham In 1528 he assisted his near neighbour at Knole House in Kent William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, to fend off \\"a host of belligerent Kentishmen\\" demanding repayments from him, and the event appears to have assisted Clement's subsequent rise.Mercer, p.165 He was knighted in 1529 and served as Sheriff of Kent 1531-2.Mercer, p.165 In the opinion of Mercer (1995), Clement's patron was Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, of Hever Castle in Kent, father of Queen Anne Boleyn,Mercer, pp.165-6 and Clement's career suffered after the queen's execution in 1536 and the downfall of her family. Imprisoned in Fleet In 1534, following conviction in the Star Chamber, he was imprisoned in the Fleet for having used force, in his capacity as a justice of the peace for Kent, during a property dispute in Shipbourne between the rector and Robert Brenner of Hadlow, a servant of Sir Edward Guildford (father-in-law of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland). Clement had expelled Brenner with the assistance of a force of 200 men he had raised for the purpose,Mercer, pp.155,170 but the Star Chamber found that he was at fault for not having enquired sufficiently into the case before resorting to force. Clement appears to have been acting against the Guildford faction, formerly the pre-eminent family in Kent until replaced by the Boleyns.Mercer, p.171 Marriages & issue He married twice, but had no legitimate issue: *Firstly, at some time before 1510, to Anne Catesby (d.1528), a daughter of Sir William Catesby of Ashby St Ledgers in NorthamptonshirePer inscription on Clement's brass in Ightham Church (Anne his first wyfe daughtr of Sr Wyll'm Catesby of North'mptonshire Knyght) and a sister Metcalfe, Walter C., ed.

Priscilla \\"Mother\\" Baltimore (13 May 1801 ‚Äì 28 November 1882, died age 81) was an abolitionist and a social worker. She adopted orphaned children and assisted former slaves. She is also known as the founder of Brooklyn, Illinois. Early life She was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, in 1801, the child of a white slaveowner and one of his slaves. Her father sold her at age 10. Later, in St. Louis, she was bought by a Methodist missionary who allowed her to buy her own freedom. It took her seven years to earn enough money. Once free, she set out in search of her father. He had moved from Kentucky to southern Missouri. Having found him, she bought her mother from him. She brought her mother back to St. Louis. Founding of Brooklyn, abolitionism In 1829, she fled St. Louis, and Missouri (a slave state), crossing the Mississippi with eleven black families, and, on the opposite bank, founded Brooklyn, Illinois, described as a freedom village, according to local oral histories (a village where the inhabitants could, despite the \\"black codes\\" in law at the time, live more freely, including escaped slaves legally liable to recapture). She may have subsequently made the trip again; there are records of her in St. Louis in the 1830s. She helped found two African Methodist Episcopal Churches (AME churches), one (St. Paul's) in St Louis, and one in (Quinn Chapel) Brooklyn.

The land the families settled was owned by a white farmer named Thomas Osburn. In 1837 he and four other white landowners had it platted (had a cadastral survey carried out). There are records of Priscilla Baltimore living in Brooklyn in 1839, and in 1851, she bought lot 521, on Madison Street, in the second house east of 6th Street. She built a simple wood-frame house there. The site was studied in an archeological dig in 2014. In 1861, one \\"Pricilla Baltimore\\" (sic), occupation \\"washer\\", paid $500 as a \\"Free Negro Bond\\" to the State of Missouri. Brooklyn became a major place of Underground Railroad activity. Priscilla Baltimore's degree of involvement in this is not known, but she was a very active abolitionist at the time, and the Quinn Chapel, with which she was closely involved, was very active in helping escapees, as were a network of other strategically-placed AME churches. After the end of the US Civil War in 1865, Priscilla Baltimore was active in social and religious organizations helping freed slaves coming north. In 1873, Brooklyn voted to incorporate, the first American majority- black community to do so. When Priscilla Baltimore died in 1882, there were two articles written about her in the St. Louis Daily Globe-Democrat, an unusual amount of coverage for a black woman at that time, and the Quinn Chapel The location of her unmarked grave in was found again in 2008, The Brooklyn Historical Society fundraised and installed a headstone in 2010.\\"Newsletter\\" , Historical Society of Brooklyn Illinois, accessed 31 Oct 2010 Brooklyn is the only known black town founded in the US in the 1800s that survives as a living community.

Situated about east of Shaftesbury, the house and garden are at the very southern edge of Wiltshire, on the border with Dorset. The house is a Grade II listed building, while the gardens have a higher Grade II* listing on Historic England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. They have been described as Jellicoe's finest work. He worked at Shute House between 1969 and 1983 for the then owners, Michael and Anne Tree, returning to revitalise the garden for new owners in the mid-1990s, in what became his final work before his death in 1996. History Shute House has a central position in the small village of Donhead St Mary, about 250m northwest of St Mary's Church. A 16th-century rectory house survives as one range of the present house. In the early 18th century, a new range was added, of three bays and faced in ashlar. In the 1940s, the Church of England sold the rectory and it became a private home. Renamed Shute House in 1955, it was designated a Grade II listed building in 1966. In 1968, the house was bought by Lady Anne Tree, and her husband, Michael. Lady Anne, a sister of the 11th Duke of Devonshire, was a noted prison reformer and her husband, Michael, was the son of Nancy Lancaster, the interior designer. They had earlier lived at Mereworth Castle in Kent, and had a connection to Geoffrey Jellicoe though work he had undertaken for Nancy and Ronald Tree at Ditchley Park in the 1930s. By the time of his work at Shute House, Jellicoe had become one of England's most successful landscape gardeners. Training originally as an architect, he moved into landscape gardening in the 1930s, helping to establish the Institute of Landscape Architects and becoming the founding president of the International Federation of Landscape Architects. During a 60-year career, he designed a series of major gardens, both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. He also made a significant contribution to landscape gardening theory; exploring, in particular, links between design and the subconscious, in which he was much influenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, and the use of water in design. The joint work Jellicoe wrote with his wife, Susan Pares, Water: The Use of Water in Landscape Architecture, was published while he was engaged at Shute.  Gardens  The Trees commissioned Jellicoe to build a series of gardens around the house, which he undertook between 1969 and 1983. The result is reputed to have been Jellicoe's favourite design, and is considered by many horticulturalists to be his finest work. In the 1990s, the house was bought by John and Suzy Lewis, who persuaded Jellicoe to come out of retirement to undertake a restoration of the gardens which had deteriorated. The gardens at Shute focus on water. A natural spring, a source of the River Nadder, is divided into two channels. One is naturalistic, the other a straight, formal rill in which the water flows over a series of copper ledges, designed to create musical notes. The bubble fountains at the top of the rill are gravity- operated, and were inspired by examples Jellicoe saw in Kashmir. The two channels reunite in a bog garden at the end of the landscape. Jellicoe designed twin grottoes, influenced by William Kent, which flank the channels. Other elements in the garden include reconstructed fish ponds, a canal, a lily pool and a camellia walk. Sculptural components include statuary, bridges and an exedra. The gardens at Shute House were given Grade II* listed status on 18 August 2020. The listing followed a three-year collaboration between Historic England and the Gardens Trust to raise awareness and appreciation of important English gardens designed in the post-war period. The gardens are open for group visits by prior appointment.

It deals with movies about drug trafficking and drug cartels, usually but not exclusively fictitious ones. Although generally considered part of Mexican cinema, some narco peliculas are actually filmed in the United States, and could actually therefore be considered American films and part of American cinema as well. History Production of narco peliculas started to peak during the late 1970s, when such films like La Banda del Carro Rojo (The Red Car Band) were released. This film starred brothers Fernando and Mario Almada and Pedro Infante, Jr..https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315254/fullcredits It spanned two sequels.https://www.filmaffinity.com/us/film496927.html With the advent of VCR technology, around 1982, en masse production of narco peliculas began.https://expansion.mx/expansion/2011/09/14/la-verdadera-industria-del- cine-mexicano VCR technology allowed producers to recoup production money by filming low budget action films and not having to compete with Hollywood films for the Mexican moviegoers' money or sharing a portion of the movie's earnings with cinema chains by releasing these films straight to VCR. The sub-genre then became popular with Mexican audiences in the United States but films were released elsewhere as well, like in Puerto Rico, for example. In 1983, the narco pelicula, Lola the Truck Driver earned $1,000,000 in Mexico and $2,500,000 in the United States, being filmed with a $150,000 budget, making this movie one of the first of the sub-genre to become a monetary success for film producers. As of 2020, in the United States, narco peliculas were available on such television channels as Cine Mexicano, which was showing such contemporary narco films as La Venganza del Muerto, El Sanguinario de la Sierra, La Reina del Narco 2, El Vengador de un Gallero and Maldito Dinero.https://www.multichannel.com/pr-feed/all-the-action-movies-coming-out- this-june-on-cine-mexicano Plots Usually, narco films are about drug cartels fighting each other for territory, and-or police organizations that want to break them. Usually, the plot leads to an end-scene gang battle in which guns and sometimes knives and bombs are employed.

Biography  He was born to a long-established Proven√ßal family that operated a mill. His mother died giving birth to him. He initially attended a boarding school, then received his secondary education at the Coll√®ge Belzunce. It was there he first displayed an aptitude for art, which was encouraged by his drawing teacher. After completing his studies, he was admitted to the . During his time there, the school's Director, √âmile Loubon, took a special liking to him and helped promote his burgeoning career.√âmile Loubon @ Larousse He was already working as a teacher before he graduated. His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1865. That same year, he produced a large \\"Resurrection of Lazarus\\" for the church in Cadolive. A series of well-received exhibitions followed. Despite these successes, he resisted living in Paris. According to one of his fellow students, the sculptor Andr√©-Joseph Allar, this was due to his strong aversion for food cooked in butter rather than olive oil. Whether or not this was a serious reason can only be surmised. In 1868, he married Rose-Marie Pignatel. They would ultimately have ten children. His son, Adrien, became a priest and an amateur painter. His youngest son, √âmile, was killed at the Battle of Verdun. During the summers, he would paint en plein aire. In winter, he would not leave his studio, and used his spare time giving private lessons. He never ventured beyond the limits of Provence. He also did a great amount of volunteer work for the local Catholic churches and parishes; decorations, restorations, making posters, drawing architectural plans and the like. In 1910, he held a major retrospective; including most of his work up to that time. He died shortly after creating a large work featuring Saint John Vianney.

It was released August 14, 2020 by Tiny Ghost Records. Recorded between 2017 and 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee, the album was produced by Wilco's Pat Sansone and featured a number of well-known Nashville musicians as Swift's backing band, including British guitarist Robyn Hitchcock, Swift's partner. Production The album developed out of a long depressive period for Swift, when writing songs of her own had become increasingly difficult. Swift found listening to Dylan, and eventually singing her own version of his songs, to be \\"a way to have something to wake up for\\", she told an interviewer for the Irish Times. Beyond the quality of Dylan's songwriting, Swift said in an interview with Nashville Scene that she was drawn to Dylan's \\"supremely confident\\" attitude as an artist during a time when she was acutely depressed. Swift finished six of the eight songs in 2017, working with producer Pat Sansone at Nashville's Magnetic Sound Studio, but put the project aside without releasing the songs. She found the inspiration to complete the album in 2020 due to the worldwide Covid-19 quarantine as well as Dylan's own 2020 album, Rough and Rowdy Ways. Recording in home studios, Swift and her band completed two more covers, including a version of \\"I Contain Multitudes\\" from Rough and Rowdy Ways. Critical reception The album received largely positive reviews from critics. Mark Moody of Under the Radar called the album \\"truly a master class in interpretation.\\" Hal Horowitz of American Songwriter praised \\"Swift‚Äôs sweet, innocent, usually mellifluous voice\\", and called the album \\"a generally successful, instantly likeable meeting of voice, production and of course songs,\\" but also felt that none of the songs were \\"definitive ... Swift and Sansone‚Äôs approach to these Dylan chestnuts is more toned down than you might expect or anticipate.\\" Joe Breen, writing in the Irish Times, noted the difficulty in finding something new in such an often-interpreted musician as Dylan, and said that \\"rarely has he been covered so tenderly as on this quietly impressive (and wittily titled) collection.\\" Brittney McKenna of Nashville Scene wrote that Swift's vocals are \\"at once delicate and tough, recalling the sturdy sultriness of Cat Power or Jenny Lewis far more than Dylan‚Äôs own folky rasp.\\" Greil Marcus, writing in his monthly \\"Real Life Rock Top 10\\" column, called the album an \\"honorable\\" tribute to Dylan, though not as good as Bettye LaVette‚Äôs similar 2018 album Things Have Changed. He singled out Swift's version of \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\", calling it a \\"real transformation... Her high, clear voice highlights each syllable, letting you hear the words form, one seemingly following inevitably from the other, until they feel handed down, fragments of old songs now speaking to each other.\\" He also praised Hitchcock's guitar work: \\"never in the way, always on the verge of fading out, making you say, no, no, not yet.\\" Personnel * Vocals: Emma Swift * Producer, guitar, keyboards, bass, percussion: Patrick Sansone * Guitar: Robyn Hitchcock * Pedal steel: Thayer Serrano * Bass: Jon Estes * Drums and percussion: Jon Radford Track listReferences Category:2020 albums Category:Covers albums Category:Bob Dylan tribute albums Category:Tiny Ghost Records albums ","title":"Blonde on the Tracks"},{"id":"65039023","text":"Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah (born 5 June 1941) is a Jamaican author and journalist known for her promotion of Rastafari culture and history.

It was first published on July 7, 2020 through William Morrow and centers upon people struggling to survive while a highly infectious virus decimates Massachusetts. Two characters from Tremblay's 2017 novel Disappearance at Devil's Rock, Josh and Luis, appear in the novel. Synopsis The state of Massachusetts is under quarantine and curfew by the government due to a new virus that resembles rabies and is extremely infectious. These measures are only a stopgap, as hospitals are ill-equipped to deal with both virus victims and their regular capacity. People are terrified and it's only a matter of time before the emergency protocols become inadequate. The novel follows Natalie, a pregnant woman, and her friend Ramola \\"Rams\\" Sherman, a pediatrician, as they try to fight their way to the hospital to obtain the rabies vaccine. Natalie has been bitten by an infected neighbor while unsuccessfully trying to defend her husband, who was suddenly attacked. Development Tremblay began writing Survivor Song in 2018 and completed his final edits by fall 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. His inspiration for the book was to \\"take on a trope of horror, tweak it and ground it in reality\\" and has noted that he believes that \\"humanity's struggles with rabies through the centuries have led to most of the human monsters we‚Äôve created in folklore and myth\\". While writing Tremblay was initially concerned that some portions of the book would not seem realistic, specifically the conspiracy theories held by a group of right-wing militiamen. After the spread of COVID-19 and conspiracy theories surrounding the virus, he stated that \\"If anything, I probably should have given them more outlandish beliefs, based on some of the reactions to the coronavirus.\\" Publication Survivor Song was first released in the United States in hardback and ebook format on July 7, 2020 through William Morrow. An audiobook adaptation, narrated by Erin Bennett, was simultaneously released through HarperAudio. It was also published in the United Kingdom through Titan Books, also on July 7, 2020. Reception Multiple reviewers have drawn comparisons between the rabies-esque virus in Survivor Song and the COVID-19 pandemic, with the New York Times and Tor.com stating that it was a timely read. Writing for the New York Times, Justin Cronin stated that \\"City shutdowns, overrun hospitals, a bungled government response, public disorder, roving wing-nut militias, conspiracy theories ‚Äî it's all here, right down to long lines at Star Market. Before this winter, the whole thing might‚Äôve looked like escapist fancy. Now it looks like your Twitter feed.\\" Jason Sheehan of NPR praised the book, as he felt that \\"Survivor Song is a small horror story. A personal one.

Violated the Chinese government's censorship order On February 14, 2017, a knife attack occurred in Pishan County, Xinjiang. Only the Jiangnan Metropolitan News violated the Chinese government's censorship order and opened the news post function on this accident, allowing the outside to see the views of Chinese netizens on the attack. In response to this behavior, a researcher of China Department of Human Rights Watch argued that Chinese netizens attacked minority Uyghur Muslims without knowing the truth, and noted that China's internet censorship undermined its own goal.

History According to Binoy Ghosh, the kings of Karnagarh ruled over a zamindari that included Midnapore and the surrounding areas. The dynasty that ruled over Karnagarh included Raja Lakshman Singh (1568-1661), Raja Shyam Singh (1661-1668), Raja Chhotu Roy (1668), Raja Raghunath Roy (1671-1693), Raja Ram Singh (1693-1711), Raja Jaswant Singh ((1711-1749), Raja Ajit Singh (1749) and Rani Shiromani (1756-1812). The kings of Karnagarh belonged to the Sadgop community and had a close link with the rulers of Narajole. The last king of Karnagarh, Raja Ajit Singh died childless. His property went into the hands of his two queens, Rani Bhabani and Rani Shiromani. During the Chuar rebellion, the leader of the Chuars, Gobardhan Dikpati, occupied the palace. Both the queens met the king of Narajole, Raja Trilochan Khan. The latter provided them shelter and promised to recover their property. Rani Bhabani died in 1161 Bangabda (1754 AD) and Rani Shiromani handed over the entire property to Anandalal of the Narajole family even before she died in 1219 Bangabda (1812 AD). However, it must be noted that the British rulers were suspicious that Rani Shiromani had links with those involved in the Chuar Rebellion and for that she had to suffer considerably at their hands.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 86-90 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. There, however, are other sources that say that the Chuar Rebellion took place as a series of insurrections by people who lived off the jungles and a sort of primitive agriculture in the old Manbhum, Bankura and Midnapore districts between 1771 and 1809, generally under dispossessed zamindars that included Rani Shiromani of Karnagarh.Sengupta, Nitish, History of the Bengali-Speaking People, UBS Publishers‚Äô Distributors Pvt. Ltd., 2001. Pages 187-188. Geography=Location Karnagarh is located at . Area overview Paschim Medinipur district (before separation of Jhargram) had a total forest area of 1,700 km2, accounting for 14.31% of the total forested area of the state. It is obvious from the map of the Midnapore Sadar subdivision, placed alongside, is that there are large stretches of forests in the subdivision. The soil is predominantly lateritic. Around 30% of the population of the district resides in this subdivision. 13.95% of the population lives in urban areas and 86.05% lives in the rural areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Demographics According to the 2011 Census of India, Karnagar had a total population of 2,812, of which 1,392 (50%) were males and 1,420 (50%) were females. There were 387 persons in the age range of 0‚Äì6 years. The total number of literate persons in Karnagar was 1,257 (51.84% of the population over 6 years). .*For language details see Salboni (community development block)#Language and religion Karnagarh fort Karnagarh fort consisted of about 100 bighas of land, stretching for about 4 miles, that was surrounded by the Parang River. It was about 4 miles north of Midnapore. The inside of the fort was divided into two parts, the andar mahal for the royal family and the sadar mahal for others. The temples of Dandesvara and Mahamaya, the ruling deities of Karnagarh, were located to the south of the fort. Now, hardly anything, other than memory, remains. The Karnagarh family had two other forts nearby ‚Äì at Abasgarh and Jamdargarh. Culture David J. McCutchion mentions the Dandesvara temple as having a pirha larger than the main temple, measuring 13‚Äô 6‚Äù square + 25‚Äô square, built of laterite having stucco decoration.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, page 69 n.

When she was seven St Andrews School for Girls was started in Fife by the women's rights campaigner Madeline Daniell and Stewart was one of their first pupils. That school was later renamed as the St Leonards School. The year before she left in 1888 she was the day girls games captain. Stewart started five years away from the school where she passed exams organised by the Royal Academy of Music in singing in 1891. She won prizes at golf and tennis and she returned to St Leonards School in 1893 when the job of 'playground mistress' was created for her.

The franchise was introduced in 2012 with Dishonored. A sequel, Dishonored 2 was released in 2016. A standalone expansion to Dishonored 2, Death of the Outsider, was released in 2017. Common elements Dishonored is a series of action-adventure games played from a first-person perspective. In the games, the player explores vast sandbox levels to assassinate different targets or complete quests. The player assumes control of an assassin who has access to various supernatural powers, which can be used to navigate a level and defeat enemies. The player can collect runes to upgrade their superpowers, or equip bone charms to unlock further boosts. Dishonored is commonly described as a series of immersive sims. The player is given freedom how they approach their objectives. For instance, the player can use stealth to avoid detection, use powers to eliminate enemies without being noticed, or directly confront opponents using the weapons and the supernatural powers. It is possible for players to complete these games without killing a non-playable character. The series is often praised for its steampunk-inspired design; developer Arkane Studios added that the games were inspired by the Victorian style, drawing references from early 1800 to the early 20th century. Dishonored is set in the Empire of the Isles, in a world where technology and supernatural magic co-exist. The major locations in the Isles include Dunwall, the Empire's capital city which uses whale oil as the city's main fuel source, and Karnaca, which is powered by wind turbines fed by currents generated by a cleft mountain along the city's borders. In the main entries, the endings are dependent on the player's chaos level, which is governed by how many characters the player has killed. Games=Dishonored (2012) In the first game, Royal Protector Corvo Attano is framed for the assassination of Empress Jessamine Kaldwin. He allies with the Loyalists‚Äîa resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider, a supernatural being who grants him magical powers, to restore Kaldwin's daughter, Emily, to the throne. Dishonored is the first game developed by Arkane Studios after it was acquired by ZeniMax Media and the first game released by Harvey Smith, the co-creator of the Deus Ex franchise, after he joined Arkane in 2008. Arkane's offices in Lyon (led by studio founder Rapha√´l Colantonio) and Austin (led by Smith) were involved in the game's development. Dishonored was released in October 2012 for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and it received very positive reviews from critics and became one of the best-selling new video game intellectual properties in the 2010s. Subsequently, Arkane released two downloadable content packs, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, for the game. Both content packs feature the assassin Daud, who murdered Empress Kaldwin at the beginning of the game. Dishonored 2 (2016) In the second game, the witch Delilah Copperspoon, who claims to be Jessamine's older half-sister and the successor to the throne, topples Emily's rule. The player, who assumes control of either Corvo or Emily, visits Karnaca in search for clues behind Delilah's source of power and attempts to reclaim Emily's throne. Dishonored 2 was mainly developed by the Lyon office, with Smith serving as its director. Colantonio and the Austin studio shifted their focus to work on Prey. The game was released in November 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Like Dishonored, the game received very positive reviews upon release. In particular, the game was lauded for its level design, with critics singling out the level \\"Clockwork Mansion\\", in which the player transforms a mansion's layout by pulling levers, as its best. However, its physical sales struggled at launch. Dishonored: Death of the Outsider (2017) Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is Dishonored 2s standalone expansion. In the game, assassin Billie Lurks seeks assassin Daud as they set out to eliminate the Outsider. Marketed as a \\"standalone story\\" in the series, the game's story concludes the narrative arc established by the first game. It is not a full sequel to Dishonored 2 as the game is shorter, more linear and more focused. Many systems were streamlined and simplified. For instance, all superpowers are unlocked at the beginning of the game, and it does not feature a chaos system. It was released in September 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Future At QuakeCon 2017, lead designer Ricardo Bare said that the series was \\"resting\\". Co- director Dinga Bakaba later clarified in 2020, saying that the press had over- interpreted Bare's statement and added that he did not think \\"there was a decision to put [the] Dishonored series on hold\\".

After liberation in 1865 she became a teacher. Her husband William D. Gibbons (1825 ‚Äì June 28, 1886), an enslaved servant, became a highly successful Baptist minister in Charlottesville and Washington, D.C. Isabella Gibbons=Under slavery Isabella's birth date, place of birth, and parents are unknown. About 1850 she was purchased by William Barton Rogers, a professor of natural philosophy (science) at the University, and was his family's cook until 1853, She apparently was taught to read by Mrs. Rogers. In the early 1850s she \\"married\\" William Gibbons, also an enslaved laborer owned by a university professor. (Enslaved people could not legally marry in Virginia.) They had four children; one was named Bella. In 1853 Rogers was replaced as professor of natural philosophy by Francis Henry Smith, and Gibbons was the cook for Smith's family until 1863. She acted as nurse at the Confederate military hospital set up at the University. After emancipation She and her husband got their freedom when General Philip Sheridan's troops reached Charlottesville, bringing the Emancipation Proclamation with them, on March 3, 1865 (see Liberation and Freedom Day). She became a teacher at the Freedmen's School; its direct descendant is the Jefferson School. Newspaper reports speak positively of her: She received similar praise in 1867 and 1869. The last reference to her as a Charlottesville teacher is from 1874. Memorial to Enslaved Laborers The only known writing of Isabella is the following letter, published in the journal of the charity providing support to schools for freedmen, the New England Freedman's Aid Society. In all the several references to her in this publication her name appears as Gibbins. The sentences with italic added were inscribed in the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville. Her eyes, from the above photograph, were etched on the outside of the memorial. Rev. William D. Gibbons=Under slavery Issbella's husband William Gibbons (1825‚Äì1890) was, like his wife, born into slavery, in his case in Pen Park, Albemarle County, Virginia. His parents and first owners are unknown. In the 1840s, he was sold to Henry Howard, M.D., professor of anatomy and surgery at the University of Virginia, and he was then hired out to William McGuffey, who had married one of Howard's daughters. He served as butler. His owner allowed him to preach to students, even though this was against the law in Virginia; He \\"later recounted that he had become a minister in 1844, although we know little about this.\\" \\"He was a general favorite with all classes, and no one had more friends than he.\\" First Baptist Church of Charlottesville William was ordained a minister of the gospel in 1866; he was called a \\"lay minister\\" or \\"licentiate\\", although the meaning of the latter term is unclear. In 1867 he accepted a call to the pulpit at Charlottesville's first Black church, the First Baptist Church of Charlottesville. As of early 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation freed all the enslaved in Confederate territory, Black worshippers did not want any longer to be required to sit in the balcony of the First Baptist Church and to be outvoted routinely on issues of importance to them; they also felt that the minister discriminated against free blacks. The Church split into Black and White congregations with the same name in the same building, although at first the Black church was required under Virginia law to have a White minister and white trustees, so the same minister led both congregations. William was the church's first Black minister, after the Union military government made Virginia laws temporarily irrelevant. The Black church soon acquired its own home, the former Delevan Hotel, and was for a few years the Delevan Baptist Church. The school in which Isabella taught was housed in the church basement. Zion Baptist Church, Washington, D.C. According to his obituary, William came to Washington in 1867 and the following year was installed as pastor of the Zion Baptist Church; a different source says that William did not become minister in Charlottesville until 1870. The published history of the First Baptist Church of Charlottesville states that \\"from the information available it is impossible to establish accurately the dates of all of the eleven pastors of the church between 1863 and 1914.\\" It reports Gibbons' pastorate ended in 1870, after \\"about two years\\" of service. However, Isabella's sponsoring agency said in 1874 that it was in serious financial difficulty; they were closing schools and their monthly publication had become yearly. The Delevan Hotel building, housing both Isabella's school and William's church, was condemned and torn down in 1876 and a replacement was not ready until 1884. At the same time references to her as a teacher in Charlottesville disappear, references to William as a Washington pastor start to appear, so the couple may have moved to Washington about 1875, or the couple may have lived separately from 1870 to 1874. He held his position at the Zion Baptist Church until his death in 1886. Under him the church grew from 200 to 1,700 members. When he died in June 1886, 10,000 mourners attended his funeral, the Washington Post reported in a front-page story. The National Republican estimated the crowd at 5,000, adding that \\"it was almost impossible to get within a block of the building\\". The entire board of the church accompanied his remains to Charlottesville, where he was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. After her death in 1890, Isabella's remains were also taken from Washington to Charlotteville, and interred there.

One of the demo recordings, \\"I Want You\\", was heard by Berry Gordy, who decided the song would be a good fit for Marvin Gaye.

Taxonomy Bathyanthias was created by the British-German zoologist Albert G√ºnther (1830‚Äì1914) as a monotypic genus with B. roseus as its only species and with a type locality given as being off Pernambuco in Brazil and the type was collected on the Challenger Expedition of 1872‚Äì1876. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that the western Atlantic species within the tribe Liopropomini, including the genus Bathyanthias, form a monophyletic group with respect to the Indo-Pacific species currently classified as being within the genus Liopropoma. This further suggests that Bathyanthias is nested within Liopropoma, these studies indicate that more research is needed into the limits of the genus Liopropoma.

UPL was established in 1975 as a successor to Oxford University Press' Dhaka branch where Mohiuddin Ahmed was chief executive. Its success in the publishing industry led to winning the National Book Centre Award 16 times since 1981. UPL is also the first publisher in Bangladesh to export books, and its books are also found at the libraries of Ivy League universities in the US. As of 2018, UPL has published around 1,500 books.  History  Mohiuddin Ahmed was initially posted at the Karachi office of Oxford University Press. After the Bangladesh liberation war in 1971, he returned to Dhaka, where he became a roving editor of OUP, coordinating the editorial activities in the branches of Dhaka, Delhi, Karachi and the East Asian branch in Malaysia. In 1975, when the Dhaka office of OUP was closed down, Ahmed decided to start UPL as a successor of OUP, as he was the chief executive in the branch. Due to a lack of advanced command in Bengali literature, he focused on English language academic and research books. UPL signed a contract with OUP and Orient Longman to adapt school text books, initially starting with six books of OUP. As the successor of OUP, UPL also retained the local employees of the former. In 2018, a function was arranged to celebrate the 40th founding anniversary of UPL at the Bangla Academy auditorium. For the first time, UPL Excellence Award was accorded to 41 different authors, institutions and patrons. The function was attended by Bangladesh's finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, Kamal Hossain, Rehman Sobhan, Mahfuz Anam, Rubana Huq, Moudud Ahmed, and Anisuzzaman, among others.  Initiatives = Road to Bangladesh series  UPL's best known initiative is the Road to Bangladesh series, initiated in the early 1990s, which is an ongoing book series on Bangladesh Liberation War to portray different perspectives on the event. The level of accuracy and expertise of the books in this series have made them highly valued among scholars.  Adopt-a-Library  In 2017, UPL initiated the Adopt-a-Library program which is aimed at improving the reading habit of the youth in Bangladesh. In cooperation with Lift Up Asia and Asialoka Trust, the program is designed to increase the accessibility of books to the readers around the country. The program also lends support to the institution-based libraries of different \\"primary and secondary schools, colleges, young learners‚Äô centers, private and government universities, and madrassas\\". The scheme offers three bundles of books to the libraries to choose from, comprising 30 books each with a plan to increase the numbers in the future. The institutions would apply to the program website to receive one of the bundles and to get onto the waiting list while the donors would select an institution from the list and the number of bundles to sponsor. A confirmation of donation would result in the bundles reaching the institution. As of 2019, at least 1,200 institutions have responded to the program.

The practice is widespread in the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, including Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari districts, despite being illegal in India.  Overview  Sculpture depicting cockfighting during the Battle of Palnadu Fights between birds such as junglefowls and roosters are said to have been arranged in ancient India as a mode of entertainment. It is recorded that the outcome of the Battle of Palnadu (1178‚Äì1182) was decided by a rooster fight, following which cockfighting gained foothold in Andhra Pradesh. In the present day, cockfighting takes place in Andhra Pradesh and other parts of India such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Odisha. Roosters are specially bred for cockfights, with knives and blades tied to their legs. The fight typically results in the death of one of the birds. Roosters are trained for fights year-round and are worth as much as . Events which can last as long as three days are organized during Sankranti, with each event drawing thousands of people. In a 2019 investigation, The Washington Post called the practice the \\"Super Bowl of cockfighting\\".  Kukkuta Sastra  Kukkuta Satra () is a shastra dealing with cockfighting. There is no information about the author or when the book is written. Kukkuta Sastra recognises 50 types of cocks suitable for cockfighting. It prescribes the diet for the cocks raised for cockfighting, including but not limited to almond, cashew, pistachio, and meat. Kukkuta Sastra is diligently followed when cocks are raised for cockfighting in India.  Ban  Cockfighting has been illegal in India since the enactment of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in 1960. Subsequent judgements by the Supreme Court of India in 2015, and the Hyderabad High Court in 2016, upheld the ban. In January 2018, the Supreme Court allowed the sport to be held in a traditional way, without the use of knives and blades and without gambling or betting. Despite the ban, cockfighting is still popular in Andhra Pradesh, with an estimated amount over being wagered in the state during a three-day period in 2019. More than 200,000 roosters have been used in cockfights in the state.  Incidents  * In 2010, in West Midnapore of the state of West Bengal, a man was killed by his rooster, which pierced his neck with a blade attached to its leg. * In 2019, in Pragadavaram, Andhra Pradesh, a spectator succumbed to the injuries inflicted by a rooster. It reportedly sunk the blade tied to its leg into his abdomen during a cockfight. Popular culture * The plot of the 2011 Tamil-language film Aadukalam directed by Vetrimaran is centred around cockfights.

It's primarily a single lane highway, historically and economically important for connecting the plateau and western Santa Catarina with the coast. It is the main \\"artery\\" of the Itaja√≠ Valley and also one of the main access routes to the Port of Itaja√≠ (the main port in the region, being the second largest in the country in handling containers, acting as a port for export and draining almost all state production, where the main exported products are wood, ceramic floors, machinery, sugar, paper and tobacco, as well as imported products such as wheat, chemical products, motors and textiles) and the Navegantes airport (the largest of the state) Santa Catarina, also of great tourist importance). Currently, 73 km are being duplicated in the most important and busiest section, between the urban centers of Navegantes, Gaspar, Blumenau and Indaial, where the state's textile, glass, porcelain and metalworking industries are concentrated.

In the section that includes Veran√≥polis and Bento Gon√ßalves, known as Serra das Antas, there is an intense traffic of slow vehicles (trucks loaded most of the time) that join the few passing points and the precarious conditions of the asphalt end up leaving the slow traffic. There is also a lack of shoulder on this stretch, as the few escape areas that did exist were eventually used to build third lanes, in order to alleviate some of the traffic there.

The spirits of ancestors are believed to possess people during religious ceremonies such as weddings, or specially organized pujas. People in Bemni are concerned about their future. Climate change and the village's isolation make it near impossible to make money from the land. Unemployment is a huge problem and people talk about feeling \\"tension\\" like never before. Some educated young people only cautiously admit they believe in ghosts. Demographic The village has changed dramatically. Some of the villagers have left the village for a number of reasons such as work, marriage with stories of disappointment, loss and success. In 2003, there was no road in the village. People used to walk uphill to reach the village. There was no electricity or telecommunication, and schooling stopped at Grade Five. In the last eight years, the building of a road and new schools, and the installation of electricity and a telecommunication tower - infrastructures that have radically improved livelihoods.

To his astonishment, the candle refuses to cooperate, moving around the table and then growing to incredible height. Finally it moves so close that the newspaper catches fire. From the fire comes an apparition of a woman, with whom the traveler is fascinated. As he kneels to court her, she changes into a grotesque, shrouded ghost, who dances in a blurry haze and walks right through the enraged traveler. The traveler tries to attack the ghost, but only manages to shatter his dinner tray, to the amusement of the hotel staff.

It increases the penalties of certain offences under the 1974 Act and empowers the Secretary of State to secure supplies of petroleum and petroleum products.  Background  The safety, health and welfare of offshore workers in the United Kingdom's sector of the North Sea had been secured since 1971 by the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and its subsidiary legislation. The Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 was administered on behalf of the Health and Safety Executive by the Petroleum Engineering Division of the Department of Energy. By the late 1970s it was recognised that there was a potential conflict of interest between the roles within the Department of Energy as they applied offshore. The conflict arose because the Department of Energy was acting as both the offshore safety regulator and with the responsibility for developing the UK's energy resources. Furthermore, there were differences in approaches to safety specified in the Minerals Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. The regulations made under the 1971 Act were prescriptive and contained detailed guidance notes, which led to an approach to safety through the rigid application of the regulations. This contrasted with the goal setting approach espoused in the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. The conflict of interest was examined in the Burgoyne Report in 1980 which supported the existing offshore approach. Following the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, the 106 recommendations of the Public Inquiry by Lord Cullen proposed fundamental changes to the regulation of offshore safety. These included the preparation and publication of Safety Cases, the strengthening of Safety Management Systems, independent assessment and survey, legislative changes and changing the regulatory body. The Offshore Safety Act legally implemented many of the Inquiry recommendations. The regulation of offshore safety was transferred in 1991 from the Petroleum Engineering Division of the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive.  Offshore Safety Act 1992  The Offshore Safety Act 1992 (1992 c. 15) received Royal Assent on 6 March 1992. Its long title is: ‚ÄòAn Act to extend the application of Part I of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974; to increase the penalties for certain offences under that Part; to confer powers for preserving the security of supplies of petroleum and petroleum products; and for connected purposes.‚Äô  Provisions  The Act comprises 7 Sections and 2 Schedules: * 1. Application of Part I of 1974 Act for offshore purposes. The purposes of the 1974 Act were amended to include securing the safety, health and welfare of people working offshore; the safety, safe construction, operation, and prevention of accidents on or near offshore installations and pipelines; and securing the safe dismantling and disposal of installations and pipelines. The remaining provisions of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 were made relevant statutory provisions of the Offshore Safety Act. * 2. Application of Part I for other purposes. Securing the safe construction and operation, preventing release from, and protecting the public from, pipelines and pipeline incidents. * 3. Provisions consequential on sections 1 and 2. Amended legislation, mainly Sections that shall ‚Äòcease to have effect‚Äô. * 4. Increased penalties under Part I. Increases certain penalties prescribed in the Health and Safety at work etc. Act 1974. * 5. Directions for preserving security of petroleum and petroleum products. Empowers the Secretary of State to give directions to preserve the security of any offshore installation, onshore terminal or oil refinery. * 6. Corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland. The Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. * 7. Short title, repeals, commencement and extent. Most of the Act commenced at Royal Assent. * Schedule 1 Model Clauses Referred to in Section 3(2) Amendments to model clauses in Acts, Statutory Instruments, etc. * Schedule 2 Repeals Sections of certain Acts repealed. The Offshore Safety Act 1992 is still current (2020) legislation.  Subsidiary legislation  A number of key offshore regulations support the aims of the 1992 Act, these were enacted as Statutory Instruments. * The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992 Statutory Instrument 1992 No. 2885, these Regulations were repealed and replaced by: * The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 2005 Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 3117. * The Offshore Installations (Prevention of Fire and Explosion, and Emergency Response) Regulations 1995 Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 743. * The Offshore Installations and Pipeline Works (Management and Administration) Regulations 1995 Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 738. * The Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction etc) Regulations 1996 Statutory Instrument 1996 No. 913. * The Offshore Installations (Offshore Safety Directive) (Safety Case etc.) Regulations 2015 Statutory Instrument 2015 No. 398. The 1992 Act and the subsidiary legislation were enforced by the Offshore Safety Division (now Offshore Energy) of the Health and Safety Executive.  Certification and verification  The prescriptive offshore certification regime had been introduced by the Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974. A Certifying Authority inspected the design, construction and operation of an installation against published guidance. This regime continued after the passage of the 1992 Act. It was replaced in 1996 with a goal-setting verification scheme by the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction etc) Regulations 1996.  Later enactments  Health and Safety (Offences) Act 2008 (2008 c. 20) repealed Section 4 of the 1992 Act.

Soon after the partition of India in 1947, he stumbled upon the plans for an Operation Gulmarg, which were apparently Pakistani plans to attack the princely state of Kashmir, two months before they were to commence. Even though he conveyed the information to the Indian authorities, he was not taken seriously. Senior Indian officials including the-then Defence Minister of India Sardar Baldev Singh, Brigadier Kalwant Singh and the DGMO, Col. P. N. Thapar, were complicit in the delay in taking action on Kalkat's information. Kalkat's account also shows the complicity of some British officials in the 1947 invasion of Kashmir.  Early life  Onkar Singh Kalkat was a postgraduate in economics from the University of Delhi.  Military career  He joined the British Indian Army at the age of 24 and studied at the Defence Services Staff College. He saw operations in both the Northeast India and Burma between 1938‚Äì45, and in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 and then in 1971 when he was commander of the 14 Infantry, leading the recapture of 32 posts from the Pakistanis. He then worked first as an instructor and then as a Commandant at College of Combat, Mhow. He opted for voluntary retirement at the age of 54 in 1972. After retirement, for two years, he was the Chief Military Intelligence Officer in the Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India, working under Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;).  Pakistan's Invasion Plans  At the time of partition of India, Major Kalkat was the Brigade Major of the Bannu Frontier Brigade Group, in present-day Pakistan, under the Command of Brigadier C. P. Murry, a British officer; who were waiting to go back to India and England, respectively. It was then in August 1947 that Kalkat stumbled upon information related to Pakistan's invasion of Kashmir, Operation Gulmarg, that was to commence in October. Kalkat was authorised to open letters for Brigadier CP Murry in his absence. On 20 August 1947, Kalkat opened one such letter from General Frank Walter Messervy, and found attached the plans for Operation Gulmarg. Kalkat informed Brigadier Murry of the letter, who in turn told him to tell no one about the information in Pakistan as it could get him killed. However, soon afterwards, Kalkat was put under house arrest by the Pakistani Army suspecting that something was up. Kalkat escaped his captors, left Mir Ali Mirali, reached Ambala in Indian Punjab and, on 18 October 1946, headed to Delhi in a goods train. The following day he met senior military officials including Brigadier Kalwant Singh, Col. P. N. Thapar (then the Director of Military Operations) and Sardar Baldev Singh, the Defence Minister, and told them about what he knew of the impending attack. But no one took Major Kalkat seriously enough to take action and the \\"British-staffed intelligence directorate paid no heed to it\\". At that time, the \\"impending invasion\\" was being reported from multiple locations. Before leaving Pakistan, Major Kalkat, with the help of his Muslim friends and the District Commissioner of Mianwali district, had got his family out of Pakistan and sent to India. While Major Kalkat was searching for his family in East Punjab, the Operation Gulmarg began. It was then that the Indian authorities realised their mistake. Major Kalkat was traced only on 24 October. He was taken to Prime Minister Nehru who shouted at everyone for not taking an officer in a responsible position seriously: In 1983, Kalkat wrote a book called Far-flung Frontiers in which he described his experiences. The foreword of the book was written by Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, then a Brigadier, who agreed with Kalkat's narrative.  Publications  First published in 1983, The Far-Flung Frontiers by Major-General O.S.

Career  Following the completion of her doctorate, Zipser was awarded a Wellcome Trust grant for a postdoctoral project on a vernacular Greek medical text by John the Physician. Zipser produced the first critical edition and translation of the text, which was published by Brill in 2009, as John the Physician's Therapeutics: a Medical Handbook in Vernacular Greek. Zipser moved to RHUL funded again by the Wellcome Trust, including a University Award. In 2019, Zipser won a Collaborative Wellcome Award for a project that develops a methodology for the identification of medicinal plants and minerals. Zipser leads the project which is an international collaboration between Royal Holloway, Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, and the PTS Zurich and Haifa. Zipser established 'Simon Online', a crowd-sourced open-access Wiki edition of Simon of Genoa's clavis sanationis, a Latin-Greek-Arabic medical dictionary from the late thirteenth century CE. In 2019, Zipser analysed ransom notes from 1981 in the kidnapping and murder case of ten-year old Ursula Herrmann, which had gone cold. Zipser used her skills in linguistic analysis to profile the ransom notes in order to determine the kidnappers identity, comparing them with writing samples by Werner Mazurek, the man who was convicted. Based on her analysis, Zipser concluded that ‚ÄúI am sure it was not Mazurek‚Äù. Her conclusions were submitted to the state prosecutor's office by Ursula Herrmann's brother.

The pier was one of the first structures in the town to be installed with electric lighting in 1899. The pier suffered storm damage in 1977 and with repair costs of ¬£500,000, the pier was instead demolished the following year. Layout Manghall and Littlewood, who were respected engineers from Manchester, proposed the pier should stretch from the promenade to the pavilion and a total of to the end of the pier head, to create an overall length of around half a mile. The width would be between with the pier head widening to to accommodate a bandstand and a landing stage for steamboats. Shops would be located around the outside of a pavilion building that would have a capacity of 2,000 people. The pier consisted of around three acres of decking with a stage that was in depth. History=Planning Proposals for a West End Pier were made in 1878, when the West End Morecambe Pier Company proposed a structure. Fourteen years later on 18 November 1892, a consortium of businessmen from Morecambe and Bradford formed the Morecambe (Regent Road) Pier Company with ¬£20,000 () in capital. Around the same time, a rival pier company, the Alexandra Road Pier and Pavilion Company, registered on 14 December 1892 with a ¬£50,000 () capital and planned to build a promenade pier with a pavilion, concert hall and shops, creating a situation where two rival companies were planning on building a new pier close to the other. In 1893, the Board of Trade intervened and stipulated that both applications would be dismissed unless a mutual agreement between the two companies could be made, on the grounds that each planned pier would intersect with the other. The two companies subsequently met on 8 February 1893 with provisional agreement that one company, the Alexandra Road Pier and Pavilion Company, should take 750 shares in return for withdrawing their application. As part of the agreement, the Regent Road company would pay ¬£100 cash towards expenses incurred by their rival company, give them 500 shares and create a position for one of their directors. The Alexandra Road Pier and Pavilion Company was dissolved on 15 September 1896. Construction West End Pier, between 1895 and 1900 Construction for the pier was given Royal Assent on 29 June 1893 on the proviso that construction would commence within two years. Now named the West End Pier Company, work began in March 1895 with rapid progress reported by September 1895. For its construction, the pier required 1000 tons of iron, 26 tons of bolts and 3 tons of nails. Opening The pier was formally opened the following year on 3 April 1896 by Colonel William Henry Foster MP of Hornby Castle. The pavilion had not been completed by the time of the official opening, with work completed around Easter 1897 and following a successful summer, preparations to complete the remainder of the pier were made. The first 200 piles for the landing stage were driven in on 18 November 1897 with the last 198 piles driven in on 23 April 1898 for the pier head. The pier was one of the first structures in the town to be installed with electric lighting in 1899. 20th century The pier sustained storm damage in 1903 and 1907, the latter washing away of the extension and a fire in 1917 destroyed the pavilion. By October 1927 following another storm, the length of the pier had been reduced to around , half it's originally constructed length. Closure and demolition A storm in November 1977 destroyed a third of the pier, isolating the open-air dancing area. With repair costs estimated at ¬£500,000 (), it was considered too prohibitive and demolition occurred in 1978. No new piers were built to replace it.

By 19 May, the Malaysian Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah confirmed that 48% of the country's COVID-19 cases (3,347) had been linked to the Kuala Lumpur Tablighi Jamaat cluster. Event Between 27 February and 1 March 2020, the Tablighi Jamaat movement organised an international conference at the \\"Masjid Jamek Sri Petaling\\" in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The religious gathering was attended by approximately 16,000 attendees, including about 1,500 from outside Malaysia. Attendees shared food, sat close together, and held hands at the event. According to guests, the leaders of the event did not talk about COVID-19 precautions, but most attendees washed their hands during the event. Malaysian authorities were criticised for allowing the event to go forward. Spread The Sri Petaling Tablighi Jamaat gathering has been linked to more than 620 COVID-19 cases, making it the largest-known centre of transmission of the virus in Southeast Asia. At least six countries have traced their cases back to the Malaysia event; most of the 73 COVID-19 cases in Brunei have been linked to the event, as well as 22 in Cambodia, 13 in Indonesia, 10 in Thailand, 5 in Singapore, 2 in the Philippines, and 2 in Vietnam. By 13 March, the Malaysian Ministry of Health had revised the number of Malaysian Tablighi Jamaat participants from 5,000 to 14,500, raising concerns that more positive cases could be discovered. Of the 14,500 participants, 41 tested positive for COVID-19, which brought the total number of cases in Malaysia to 238. By 17 March, the Sri Petaling event had resulted in the biggest increase in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, with almost two thirds of the 673 confirmed cases in Malaysia linked to this event. On 29 March, the Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah announced that the Tabligh cluster had reached the fifth generation. By 19 May, Noor Hisham confirmed that 48% of Malaysia's COVID-19 cases (3,347) had been linked to the Sri Petaling tabligh cluster. Aftermath The Sri Petaling Tablighi Jamaat gathering coincided with a domestic political crisis that had been triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed on 24 February, which led to the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan coalition government and the resignation of Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad. Prior to the formation of a new Perikatan Nasional government under the leadership of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on 1 March, the Health Ministry would not have a minister for over two weeks until the appointment of Adham Baba on 10 March. During that time, there was only advice from the Health Ministry to minimise public exposure. In response to a rapid rise in cases, Malaysian health authorities from 11 March began tracking around 5,000 Malaysian citizens who were suspected of being exposed to COVID-19 during the Sri Petaling Tablighi Jamaat gathering. Many of the infected had returned to their respective states and communities, which had led to a surge in community transmissions throughout Malaysia. In mid-April, Adham criticized the former PH Government's handling of the Sri Petaling Tabligh Jamaat cluster. In response, Dzulkefy defended the PH Government's preparations for COVID-19 and suggested that Prime Minister Muhyiddin, the former Home Affairs Minister, was responsible for the outbreak since public gatherings like the Tabligh Jamaat would have come under his portfolio.

Demonstrations = 13 August 2020  On 13 August 2020, FACTS NZ and Kotahitanga Movement Aotearoa organised an anti- lockdown protest, that was attended by 60 people including Advance New Zealand co-leader and New Zealand Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika. The two groups held separate marches walking from Forum North to the WhƒÅngarei police station, when they arrived at the police station both groups delivered speeches in regard to the COVID-19 alert levels, Nationwide and Auckland lockdown(s). Afterwards the two groups combined and continued their demonstration walking along Walton and Dent Street which resulted in cars being stopped at traffic lights and roundabouts. There have been no known arrests in relation to this demonstration, however there was a police presence monitoring the protests to ensure they remained peaceful.  22 August 2020  On 22 August 2020 in Aotea Square, Auckland there was a COVID-19 anti- lockdown, anti-vaccination, anti-5G and anti-1080 protest organised by NZ Liberty March in which 150 people attended, the protest was peaceful and there were no significant issues or arrests made. The demonstrators used the handling of COVID-19 in Sweden as an example as what New Zealand should have done, discrediting those who said its handling of COVID-19 was horrible and criticised the government's lockdown policy. Some attendees also made health claims regarding COVID-19 but did not elaborate. A minimal amount of attendees wore masks, however all attendees stuck to those that resided with them keeping distance between protestors that did not reside with them.  29 August 2020  On 29 August 2020 in Aotea Square, Auckland there was an anti- lockdown, COVID-19 denying, anti-vaccination, anti-United Nations protest, in which 500 people attended including Advance NZ co-leader Jami-Lee Ross and New Conservative Party deputy leader Elliot Ikilei. Most protestors did not wear masks or adhere to social distancing requirements. 5 September 2020 On 5 September, several anti-lockdown protests were held throughout the country including Auckland, WhangƒÅrei, Wellington, New Plymouth, Tauranga, Rotorua, Nelson and Christchurch. The protest in Auckland's Aotea Square was organised by the NZ Liberty Movement, whose Facebook page reported 500 participants. The Auckland protest breached the Alert Level 2.5 ban on gatherings above ten people. In Rotorua, protesters, many of them claiming to be from the Advanced NZ party, gathered at Te Manawa, the intersection of Hinemoa and Tutanekai Streets. Some participants objected to wearing masks while others highlighted the financial and emotional damage caused by the lockdown.'  12 September 2020  On 12 September 2020, anti-lockdown, COVID-19 denying protestors again marched from Aotea Square in Auckland. The protest was organised by Advance New Zealand co-leader Billy Te Kahika who dubbed it the 'National Rally for Freedom'. It is estimated that over 1,000 protestors were in attendance, including Jami-Lee Ross, Advance New Zealand's other co-leader. Many signs labelled New Zealand a police state. Other protestors carried signs unrelated to COVID-19, including some advocating against vaccines and 5G.  10 October 2020  On 10 October, the Advance NZ party staged a \\"Rally for your Future\\" in Auckland's Aotea Square. The party's leader Jami-Lee Ross gave a speech claiming that New Zealand's freedoms were being eroded \\"in the name of the virus\\" and calling for people to vote for Advance NZ. Several signs read \\"COVID=Nazi Nexus\\" and that \\"Children are not for sale.\\" The NZ Liberty Movement, which had previously organised rallies with Advance NZ, did not participate in the \\"Rally for your Future\\" due to a breakdown in communication and coordination with the latter.

Harich-Schneider raised her daughters Lili and Susanne alone. Since the early 1920s, (the Proust translator) and Klabund were among her friends. She studied piano in Berlin with Conrad Ansorge. When she was already an established pianist, she took lessons with Wilhelm Klatte (1870-1930). In 1924, she made her debut at the first performance of Paul Hindemith's Suite 1922 at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. But she only moved finally from Frankfurt (Oder) to Berlin in 1927. From about 1929, she studied harpsichord with G√ºnther Ramin in Leipzig and then until 1935 with Wanda Landowska in Paris (summer courses). In 1930, she first performed publicly as a harpsichordist in Berlin. In 1930, she founded a fortnightly concert series of collegium for early music and began to study sources in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, which led to her later book Die Kunst des Cembalo-Spiels. From 1932 to 1940, she was professor and head of the harpsichord class at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin, where she also taught stylistics and chamber music. In 1940 she was dismissed there (as a catholic antifascist) in connection with politically motivated conflicts. In 1941, Harich-Schneider took advantage of an invitation to go to Tokyo in order to escape the grip of Nazi power. There she gave concerts and taught. Some time later she began to study Japanese language, writing and music. She had a love affair with the \\"master spy\\" Richard Sorge, whose activities she knew. After the war, she taught in Tokyo both at the US Army College and in the Court Music Department of the Imperial House of Japan (1947 to 1949). She published two standard works on Japanese music. In 1949, she went to New York, where she attended Japanese Studies at Columbia University and Sociology at The New School for Social Research. She received an award for her master's thesis The relations of foreign and native elements in the development of Japanese music - a case study. 1955 - she became a Guggenheim Fellow in that year - she taught harpsichord at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Vienna until 1972. In 1968, she was also awarded the Austrian Cross of Merit for Science and Art. In Japan she received the high Imperial Japanese House Order Order of the Precious Crown in 1977. Since 1941, Eta Harich-Schneider has also translated literary works from several languages into German, especially English (Shakespeare's sonnets). Her harpsichord and clavichord students included Carla Henius, Ren√© Clemencic and Christiane Jaccottet. In her autobiography Charaktere und Katastrophen,Charaktere und Katastrophen on WordCat she reports on her efforts to resist the increasing influence of Nazi-oriented functionaries and musicians on the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik by constitutional means until 1941. In addition, the book gives a nuanced account of the situation in the circle of Germans in Japan from 1941 until after 1945, not excluding human error, intrigue and tactical followers. It also reports on the situation of the Japanese population during the war (air raids). But even at the university in Berlin she was only partially successful in the 1930s - in the end, as an anti-fascist-oriented Catholic, she was pushed aside by intrigues, which she describes in detail in her autobiography. After the war, she was one of the leading authorities on Japanese music, with close contacts to the Japanese imperial house. Harich-Schneider died in Vienna in 1986 at the age of 88. Her daughter Lili Harich (24 May 1916 - 1960) was a soprano and her younger daughter (5 February 1918 - 1950) a writer.  Work  Harich-Schneider wrote books on the technique of harpsichord playing and Japanese music. She has made recordings of Baroque music, such as the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, BWV 988 in 1973 and the two-and three-part Inventions BWV 772-786 and 787‚Äì801, as well as recordings East Asian music.For example Buddhist Music, Shinto Music, B√§renreiter, Unesco Collection 1966 During her time in Berlin, she raised the playing of early music to a new level: \\"One would probably have liked to leave the amateurs their joy in the undemanding playing of the rediscovered music of earlier centuries, but with almost religious fanaticism they forced their bawling opinions on professional musicians.Harich-Schneider \\"Charaktere und Katastrophen\\", . She adds that Furtw√§ngler, for example, has been spoiled by this \\"immodest style bickering\\" of the lay public, which has spoiled his interest in early music.

It disappeared in a reorganization of 1914. Congo Free State Article 3 of the decree of 16 April 1887 provided for the Congo Free State to be divided into administrative districts headed by district commissioners, assisted by one or more deputies. The decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts, of which the first five were in the lower Congo region, including Stanley Pool District with its headquarters in L√©opoldville. A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows the Stanley Pool District stretching along the east bank of the Congo River upstream from the Livingstone Falls past L√©opoldville to just south of Lukolela. The district was named after Stanley Pool, a widening of the Congo above L√©opoldville. It was bordered to the south by the Cataractes District, to the east by the Kwango, Lualaba Kassai and Lac L√©opold II districts, and to the north by √âquateur District. The French territories were across the river to the west. Belgian Congo The Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo. On a 1910 map the Stanley Pool District had been renamed Moyen-Congo District, with various changes to the boundary. It was now bordered by the Bas-Congo District to the south, Kwango and Lac L√©opold II districts to the east, and √âquateur district to the north. A major reorganization in 1914 adjusted boundaries and grouped the districts into provinces. A 1926 map shows a new urban district of L√©opoldville had been created around the capital city, and Moyen-Congo District had been merged into Bas-Congo (south) and Lac L√©opold II (north).

He worked principally in portraiture but also painted many religious subjects for the Roman Catholic Church. He was appointed director of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura in Quito in December 1860 and served as director of the Escuela de Bellas Artes of the same city from 1872 to 1875.  Life  Cadena was born on 12 January 1830 in Machachi, in the province of Pichincha in Ecuador. His first studies were with Antonio Salas. Between 1852 and 1856, he was in Santiago de Chile, where he worked in portraiture and came under the influence of the French Neo-classical painter Raymond Monvoisin, who was living there. In 1854 the government of Jos√© Mar√≠a Urvina approved three bursaries of six thousand pesos to enable artists to travel to Italy to study. Cadena was the first to receive one of these grants, and in 1857 he travelled to Rome, where he enrolled at the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca and studied under Alessandro Marini. In 1860 he returned to Quito, and in December of that year, he was appointed director of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura there. His acceptance of the position was a condition of the scholarship he had received; he held it until December 1862. From 1872 to 1875, under the second presidency of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, he was director of the Escuela de Bellas Artes of Quito. He died in Quito in 1889.  Work  Cadena worked mostly as a portraitist. He also painted a number of religious canvases, among them a series of eight scenes of the Life of St. Augustine in the Convent of San Agust√≠n in Quito, commissioned in 1864, and a series of Mysteries of the Virgin of the Rosary for the in the same city, commissioned in 1888. Several of his works are in the Museo de Arte Moderno of the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana in Quito. Among them are a full-length portrait of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, a self-portrait, various nude studies and a Rapto de Deyanira. Hilandera campesina, a genre painting of a girl spinning, is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
