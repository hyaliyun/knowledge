History 9th Wonder founded It's A Wonderful World Music Group shortly after leaving the group Little Brother. The idea of starting his own label was given to him by a fiance of one of the members of his production team. The company initially had distribution from Warner Music Group under Asylum and Warner Bros. Records. However, creative differences between 9th and Asylum Records were the primary delay behind the release of his 2011 album The Wonder Years. He then left the company and sought distribution from Traffic Entertainment Group and The Orchard for the physical release of It's A Wonderful World's first offering, Big Remo's 2010 album Entrapment and his long-delayed The Wonder Years. In January 2008, 9th Wonder initially announced plans to start two independent record labels, Jamla and The Academy, under the It's a Wonderful World imprint. The names of the two labels referenced his background: The Academy referred to his position as a college professor, while Jamla was a nod to Motown Records' original name Tamla Records. Jamla originally consisted of Brooklyn rapper Skyzoo, 2005‚Äì06 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team player Quentin Thomas - better known as the moniker GQ, rapper Rapsody, R&B; singer Tyler Woods, and hardcore rapper Big Remo. The Academy consisted of rapper HaLo, singer Heather Victoria, Thee Tom Hardy, North Carolinian duo Actual Proof, TP & The Away Team. The Academy artists were later folded into the Jamla label. In 2012, It's A Wonderful Music Group obtained distribution from its current distributor, Empire Distribution. The first album released under the deal was Rapsody's debut The Idea of Beautiful. Jamla also had a short-lived joint venture deal with Buckshot's Duck Down Music to distribute albums by Skyzoo and The Away Team. In July 2010, 9th Wonder officially debuted his production team for IWWMG. The Soul Council consists of Khrysis, E. Jones, Fatin \\"10\\" Horton, Ka$h Don't Make Beats, AMP, Eric G., & 9th Wonder himself. In August 2014, 9th Wonder announced Nottz as being the newest member of The Soul Council. In November 2015, Hi-Tek was announced as the newest member of The Soul Council. Aside from 9th Wonder being the President and CEO, other members of Jamla hold executive positions as well. The Away Team member Sean Boog was named as label manager in 2013. In April 2015, recording engineer Young Guru was named as the Director of Operations. The Soul Council producer AMP is also the label's artwork director, while Khrysis is the label's in-house recording engineer as well as mixing and mastering engineer.

Appearance Aloiampelos ciliaris can always be identified by the tiny white \\"eyelashes\\" (=ciliaris) that circle the stem, at the base of the leaf. They can be differentiated from other Aloiampelos species by the way that the soft, white, hair-like teeth (=ciliaris) that grow along the margins of the leaves, extend all the way around the stem, at the base of the leaf. The fleshy leaves themselves are strongly recurved (helping to anchor the tall stems in dense thickets and assist the plant in climbing). The leaf sheaths are conspicuously striped green and white. These plants grow very quickly, producing long, thin, untidy stems that shoot upwards, producing large bright orange-red flowers once they reach the sun. If there are no nearby trees to act as host and support, it just forms a straggly shrub. The red flowers appear mostly from November to April. Distribution The recurved leaves can act as hooks, to anchor the plant's stem as it climbs through its natural thicket habitat or, in this case, up a garden fence. Aloiampelos ciliaris is naturally widespread in the coastal and thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape, flowing over the Western Cape border. Especially in dry river valleys where they grow in thorny forests, their long stems pushing rapidly upwards and out through the thicket canopy. Their recurved leaves act as hooks, allowing the plant to anchor itself in the thick vegetation. This species seems to have developed from a smaller, rarer, more delicate plant now classified as a subspecies, Aloe ciliaris subsp. tidmarshi, and to have spread out across the region relatively recently. The ancestral subspecies remains restricted to the Albany thickets of the Eastern Cape, between Grahamstown and Uitenhage. While Aloiampelos ciliaris was originally indigenous to the dry thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape, from the Baviaanskloof mountains to as far as the Ciskei, this adaptable species has been widely introduced and currently occurs across much of South Africa.http://redlist.sanbi.org/species.php?species=2206-56 They grow very easily from cuttings, and they have been planted in gardens all over South Africa. This is the fastest growing of all aloes and their relatives.http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/aloecilcil.htm An introduced population in Kenya was reported in 1950 by the botanist G. W. Reynolds (1950:353). Related species Aloiampelos ciliaris is one of the species in the genus that now grows throughout Southern Africa. Some other species are: Aloiampelos tenuior, Aloiampelos gracilis, Aloiampelos commixta, Aloiampelos juddii and Aloiampelos striatula.Brandham, P.E. and Carter, S. 1990.

It was unveiled on 12 August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of the composer's birth. Background Carl Heinrich Breidenstein (1796‚Äì1876) was Germany's first professor of musicology. He had held a post at Bonn University since 1823. In 1828 he had first expressed the idea of a monument to Beethoven in his native town. In 1832 he wrote an article suggesting the idea, \\"or, even better, a living memorial, one dedicated to art, Bildung, education, etc.\\" Up to that time it had not been German or Austrian practice to erect statues of great cultural figures. Friedrich Schiller had to wait until 1839; the first one of Mozart (in Salzburg, Austria) was not unveiled until 1842; and the first one of Beethoven in Vienna, the city he spent most time in, was most associated with, and died in, was not created until 1880. On 17 December 1835, the \\"Bonn Association for the Beethoven Monument\\", headed by the famous translator of Shakespeare, August Wilhelm Schlegel, issued a call for a permanent memorial to Beethoven, which was sent to all the principal musical publications in Germany, France, and England. King Ludwig I of Bavaria was enthusiastic, but the response was otherwise not very promising: in Paris, Luigi Cherubini promised a special fund-raising concert but later changed his mind; in London, Beethoven's friend Sir George Smart and Ignaz Moscheles gave a benefit concert at the Drury Lane Theatre, including the Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony, but it was poorly attended. Franz Liszt involved himself in the project in October 1839 when it became clear it was in danger of foundering through lack of financial support. Till then, the French contributions had totalled less than 425 francs; Liszt's own personal donation exceeded 10,000 francs. He contributed his advocacy and also his personal energies in concerts and recitals, the proceeds of which went towards the construction fund. One such concert was his last public appearance with Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, a pair of piano duo concerts held at the Salle Pleyel and the Conservatoire de Paris on 25 and 26 April 1841., p. 32. The sole condition of Liszt's involvement was that the sculptor of the statue of Beethoven should be the Italian, Lorenzo Bartolini. In the event, the contract was awarded to a German, Ernst Julius H√§hnel (1811‚Äì1891). The casting was done by Jakob Daniel Burgschmiet of Nuremberg. Liszt returned to the concert stage for this purpose; he had earlier retired to compose and spend time with his family. He also wrote a special work for occasion of the unveiling, Festival Cantata for the Inauguration of the Beethoven Monument in Bonn, S.67 (Festkantate zur Enth√ºllung des Beethoven-Denkmals in Bonn). Other musicians had been involved earlier: Robert Schumann offered to write a \\"Grande Sonate\\", have it published with gold trim and black binding, and use the proceeds of the sale for the building fund. His Obolen auf Beethovens Monument: Ruinen, Troph√§en, Palmen: grosse Sonate f√ºr das Pianoforte f√ºr Beethovens Denkmal, von Florestan und Eusebius (Small Contribution to Beethoven‚Äôs Monument: Ruins, Trophies, Palms: Grand Sonata for the Pianoforte for Beethoven‚Äôs Memorial, by Florestan and Eusebius) underwent some name changes. His publishers did not accept it in 1836, and so he revised it and had it published in 1839 as his Fantasie in C, Op. 17, with a dedication to Liszt. In the first movement, Schumann possibly alludes to a theme from Beethoven's song cycle An die ferne Geliebte (To the Distant Beloved) which if true, was also an allusion to his own \\"distant beloved\\", Clara Wieck, who was then separated from him in Paris, by order of her father Friedrich Wieck. In 1841 Felix Mendelssohn wrote his Variations s√©rieuses in D minor for the project. The unveiling was originally scheduled for 6 August 1843, but was postponed to 12 August 1845. On 12 May 1845, Schlegel died. His place as head of the organising committee was taken by the instigator of the idea, Heinrich Breidenstein. Beethoven Monument Hasty building of the Beethoven Hall The official unveiling of the Beethoven Monument was to be the high point of a 3-day Beethoven Festival. A month before the festival was due to commence, there was not a suitable venue to hold the expected 3,000 attendees. At Liszt's urgings, and only after he offered to bear the full cost himself, the committee engaged an architect and builders to construct the Beethoven Hall. By the time they finally started, they had less than two weeks to do this, and had to work around the clock to finish it on time. Fortunately, a little more attention had been paid to the musicians who were to perform the music. The orchestra was made up of players from provincial orchestras from the area. The double basses included the world famous Domenico Dragonetti, who had known Beethoven and was then 82, but was still an able performer. He was dead within less than a year. Opening celebrations Statue in Bonn by Ernst Julius H√§hnel The Beethovenfest (Beethoven Festival) started on Sunday 10 August 1845. Louis Spohr, who had known Beethoven, conducted the Missa solemnis and the 9th Symphony that evening. On the morning of the unveiling, Tuesday 12 August, the Mass in C major was performed in the Cathedral. Then the official unveiling was held. It was attended by a large number of prominent figures: King Frederick William IV of Prussia and his consort; Queen Victoria (as part of her first continental visit since acceding to the throne 8 years earlier) and Prince Albert; Archduke Friedrich of Austria; the composers Hector Berlioz, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Ignaz Moscheles and F√©licien David; the conductors Charles Hall√© and Sir George Smart; the baritones Josef Staudigl and Johann Baptist Pischek (1814-1873); the sopranos Jenny Lind and Pauline Viardot; and Lola Montez. Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn, who had both written major works for the piano to raise funds for the monument, were unable to be present. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin declined to attend as he detested bombastic public ceremonial.Russell Martin, Beethoven's Hair, 2000, p. 40 Richard Wagner did not attend, but he was certainly aware of the event, as he wrote to Liszt a week before the opening, proposing the erection of a similar statue to Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden. A parchment signed by all the visiting dignitaries was sealed in a lead casket inside the monument. This was followed by an afternoon concert: Liszt played the Emperor Concerto and conducted the Fifth Symphony, and Spohr led the Coriolan Overture, an aria from the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives, and the quartet and finale from Fidelio. It was originally proposed that Berlioz's Requiem would be played; Berlioz insisted that he, and only he, conduct the work if it were to be played at all, but this did not please the Bonn committee, so the plan was dropped. That evening there was a spectacular fireworks display. The next day, Wednesday 13 August, there was a concert lasting four hours: it included Liszt's Festival Cantata for the Inauguration of the Beethoven Monument in Bonn (given twice, once without the royal guests, and again after their arrival), Beethoven's Egmont overture, a piano concerto by Weber, Leonora‚Äôs aria from Fidelio, a Mendelssohn aria, and the song Adelaide. This was followed by a banquet for 550 guests at the Hotel Der Stern. The banquet was disrupted by the behaviour of Lola Montez, who danced on a table and embarrassed Liszt by insisting she was his guest at the celebrations and demanding a seat appropriate to her claimed status, thus upsetting a pre-organised seating arrangement. This scandalised the Bonn authorities, and it rebounded on Liszt himself, so much so that when Beethoven's centenary was celebrated in Bonn in 1870, he was not invited to attend. The monument itself Sir George Smart declared the facial features of the statue a good likeness of Beethoven, as did Ignaz Moscheles. But Beethoven's assistant Anton Schindler was contemptuous of it.

PAMM solution allows the trader on one trading platform to manage simultaneously unlimited quantity of managed accounts. Depending on the size of the deposit, each managed account has its own ratio in PAMM. Trader's activity results (trades, profit and loss) are allocated between managed accounts according to the ratio. Because currency trading and other forms of arbitrage achieve profitability within very narrow margins, typically, a PAMM system allows more money to be brought into play while distributing the risk of one trader across (usually) multiple investors. Example Assume that there are 3 managed accounts under trader's management: 1\\\\. USD account with deposit of $100,000 and ratio 9.3% 2\\\\. EUR account with deposit of ‚Ç¨400,000 and ratio 49.5% 3\\\\. GBP account with deposit of ¬£300,000 and ratio 41.2% Depending on funded amounts, different ratios are applied for managed account (for ratio calculation all amounts are converted in USD equivalent based on market rate). In case if, for example, a trader (money manager) decides to buy 10 million EURUSD, PAMM allocates the order between managed accounts according to its ratio. Each managed account has its own part of position and corresponding profit and loss. In current example, the first managed account will get position LONG 930,000 EUR/USD, the second - LONG 4,950,000 EUR/USD and the third - LONG 4,120,000 EUR/USD. Resulting profit & loss will be automatically calculated for each account depending on market prices. Overview The percent allocation management module is a form of piggybacking a large investor's money onto the smaller account of a trader. The trader's own money remains at risk, which theoretically reduces the chance of irresponsible management of the combined funds. PAMM is actually a more advanced descendant of \\"LAMM\\", which is a \\"lot allocation management module\\". In a LAMM trading system, if the trader buys one standard lot of a currency, each of the customers' accounts will also be increased with a standard lot of the currency, regardless of the relative size of the customer's account. This makes sense for accounts where the customer's assets are about the same size as the trader's, but it makes less sense when the customer's portfolio is much larger than the trader's. Thus, PAMM was developed as an alternative to LAMM. Alpari launched the PAMM service in 2008. Depending on currency with which the customer has funded their own account, the ratio calculation of each customer's share is typically converted to United States dollar amounts. This facilitates a more streamlined investor-trader relationship. Money allocation for traders and investors PAMM allocation In this infographic example, there are four investors, each with a different amount of risk capital that choose the same money manager. The money manager trades the entire capital, $100,000 total, on one master account (the money manager can only trade the accounts; no access to the investor's funds is permitted to withdraw funds). The money manager then makes a profit of $12,500, and because in this example the commission fee is 20%, that equals to $2,500 in commissions for the money manager. This leaves $110,000 in the master account. The $10,000 profit made will now be credited back to the investors accounts based on the percentage of their share of risk capital in the pool.

Her work, notable for its feminist and ecological themes, has won numerous awards. Known for her music for orchestra, chorus, chamber ensembles and the stage, she also teaches composition. Biography Janika Vandervelde was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, and grew up in nearby Green Lake, playing horn and piano starting at age five. She began composing in her teens. After undergraduate studies in music education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire, she relocated to the Twin Cities of Minnesota, earning a doctorate in composition from the University of Minnesota (1985), where her teachers included Dominick Argento and Eric Stokes. She has taught intermittently at the University of Minnesota School of Music, and teaches regularly at Hamline University and at the Perpich Center for Arts Education, a residential high school for the arts in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Vandervelde is the author of Music by Kids for Kids, a composition curriculum designed for computer labs equipped with MIDI keyboards, published by the American Composers Forum. She was associate conductor of the Mississippi Valley Chamber Orchestra, and also served as music director at Wesley United Methodist Church in Minneapolis. Compositions Vandervelde is known especially for her choral music, which has been commissioned and performed by groups such as Chanticleer, the Dale Warland Singers, and the Oregon Repertory Singers, and by conductors including Sir David Willcocks. She has composed more than 100 works for orchestra, choir, chamber ensembles, and soloists, as well as two operas, Hildegard (1989) and Seven Sevens (1993), and has written extensively for young audiences. Among the fruits of her three-year tenure as composer-in-residence for the Minnesota Chorale and two other Twin Cities organizations was Adventures of the Black Dot, a \\"choral storybook\\" for children, with story by Judy McGuire and staging by Kari Margolis. Recent projects include choral music for The Student, a collaboration with choreographer-director Vanessa Voskuil, and a 65-minute electronic soundscape for Diana Takes a Swim, a collaboration with dancer-choreographer Deborah Jinza Thayer. Vandervelde's work is published by Hothouse Press, earthsongs, Augsburg Fortress, Boosey & Hawkes, and Miela Harmonija. Reception Vandervelde's music has been warmly received. She has been called \\"a passionate experimenter and ingenious explorer of new sonorities\\" and \\"a composer whose style reflects a freely inquisitive artistic personality.\\" Most notably, the feminist musicologist Susan McClary argued that Vandervelde's piano trio \\"Genesis II moves metaphorically through a series of natural, cultural, and historical worldviews, holding them in tension and contradiction.\\" McClary also argued that \\"Vandervelde's use of a rhythmically insistent but harmonically ambiguous academic minimalism [expresses] female embodiment and pleasure.\\" McClary's feminist readings of Vandervelde's work, along with her readings of other composers, ignited a debate in musical criticism and scholarship. Genesis II (premiered and recorded by the Mirecourt Trio) is discussed at length in Take Note, an undergraduate music-appreciation textbook by musicologist Robin Wallace, published in 2014 by Oxford University Press; the work is part of the book's \\"core repertory.\\" Awards Vandervelde has won numerous awards for her work as a composer, including multiple Bush Artist Fellowships and McKnight Foundation Composer Fellowships. She is also a recipient of the Lili Boulanger Award from The Women's Philharmonic of San Francisco.

Lilac Time was produced by John McCormick (Moore's husband), and distributed by First National Pictures. The film is based on a 1917 Broadway play written by Jane Murfin and actress Jane Cowl, who adapted the story from a novel by Guy Fowler.\\"Production: 'Lilac Time' produced on Broadway in 1917.\\" IMDb, 20190. Retrieved: June 16, 2019. Lilac Time offers several phases, beginning with slapstick comedy elements, becoming an intense romantic film, then segueing into a spectacular aerial showdown. This was followed by a duel in the sky between Cooper's character and the \\"Red Ace\\" before returning to romantic complications. Plot Seven young English aviators are billeted at the Berthelot farm near the French front. One of the flyers, Philip Blythe (Gary Cooper) is a replacement pilot who falls in love with the farmer's daughter, Jeannie (Colleen Moore), She loves Philip, and on the morning before a dangerous mission he also declares his love for her. Philip is shot down, and Jeannie helps an ambulance crew to extricate his apparently lifeless body from the wrecked aircraft. The crew will not allow Jeannie to accompany Philip and cannot tell her where they are taking him. Jeannie obtains an address for the military army hospital where he is. When she visits, she is told that he has died from his wounds, based on incorrect records. Jeannie sends a bouquet of lilacs to his room in remembrance, and Philip, recognizing the flowers as her gift, painfully drags himself to his window in time to call her back to him.

For some scenes, the deserted village in Allaire, New Jersey were used for backdrops.Sitkus 2002, p. 42. In addition a portable machine shop serviced the seven Waco 10 biplanes purchased and leased by aerial coordinator Dick Grace for the production.Wynne 1987, p. 82. The crash scenes in Lilac Time turned out to be particularly difficult and hazardous. One scene called for Grace to crash and flip upside down in an aircraft. The second crash scene involved a crash-landing where the aircraft pirouetted on its nose and nearly hitting Opal Boswell, Moore's double, who scampered out of the way at the last moment. The third crash pitted a Waco 10 against a stand of eucalyptus trees that tore off the wings of the taxiing aircraft.Wynne 1987, pp. 82‚Äì83. Looking for realism, many extras cast as soldiers in the film had been actual World War I soldiers, in the ranks they portrayed. The chief stunt pilot, Dick Grace, had only finished doing stunt work on the Paramount film Wings (1927) nearly two months earlier. Grace sustained a severe neck injury in a stunt crash while making Wings but recovered in time for Lilac Time. Among those in the cast were Colleen Moore's brother Cleve (billed as \\"Cleve Moore\\") and her cousin, Jack Stone. Eugenie Besserer had played \\"Mrs. Goode,\\" a mother figure in Colleen's earlier film Little Orphant Annie, the first film to bring Colleen a measure of fame.\\"Progressive Silent Film List: 'Lilac Time'.\\" silentera.com. Reception Lilac Time had its opening in Los Angeles at the Carthay Circle Theatre where, in the lobby, among other promotional materials on display, was the wrecked fuselage of one of the aircraft that had been destroyed during the filming. The film cost one million dollars to produce, an amount equal to Moore's previous two films. The studio recouped the cost of the film within months. By the end of 1928, the film had out-performed Moore's earlier star vehicle Flaming Youth (1923). Lilac Time was released with a Vitaphone score and music effects, featuring the song \\"Jeannine, I Dream of Lilac Time,\\" but there was no spoken dialogue. The film premiered in New York City on August 3, 1928, and was released in the United States on October 18, 1928.Codori 2012, p. 204. Aviation film historian James H. Farmer in Celluloid Wings: The Impact of Movies on Aviation (1984), described Lilac Time, as \\"Overly sentimental; somewhat redeemed by the film's original aerial sequences, including several crashes; all of which were shot specifically for the production.\\"Framer 1984, p. 318. Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, inAviation in the Cinema (1985) had similar views about Lilac Time, noting, \\"of all the aviation films of the period, 'Lilac Time' stands out as one of the most sentimental ...\\"Pendo 1985, p. 82.

Individuals on the autistic spectrum experience difficulties with social communication and interaction and also exhibit restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Symptoms are typically recognized between one and two years of age. However, a lot of children are not finally diagnosed until they are older. Final diagnosis could still be given as an adolescent or even as an adult. The term \\"spectrum\\" refers to the variation in the type and severity of symptoms. Those in the mild range may function independently, while those with moderate to severe symptoms may require more substantial support in their daily lives. Long-term problems may include difficulties in performing daily tasks, creating and keeping relationships, and maintaining a job. The cause of autism spectrum conditions is uncertain. Risk factors include having an older parent, a family history of autism, and certain genetic conditions. It is estimated that between 64% and 91% of risk is due to family history. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. In 2013, the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5) replaced the previous subgroups of autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and childhood disintegrative disorder with the single term \\"autism spectrum disorder\\". Treatment efforts are generally individualized and can include behavioural therapy and the teaching of coping skills. Medications may be used to try to help improve symptoms. Evidence to support the use of medications, however, is not very strong. An estimated 1% of the population (62.2 million globally) are on the autism spectrum . In the United States it is estimated to affect more than 2% of children (about 1.5 million) as of 2016. Males are diagnosed four times more often than females. The autism rights movement promotes the concept of neurodiversity, which views autism as a natural variation of the brain rather than a disorder to be cured. Classification DSM-IV diagnoses that fall under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder in DSM-V Autism forms the core of the autism spectrum disorders. Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; unlike autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no significant delay in language development or cognitive development, according to the older DSM-IV criteria. PDD-NOS is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Some sources also include Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, which share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; other sources differentiate them from ASD, but group all of the above conditions into the pervasive developmental disorders. Autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS are sometimes called the autistic disorders instead of ASD, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism. Although the older term pervasive developmental disorder and the newer term autism spectrum disorder largely or entirely overlap, the earlier was intended to describe a specific set of diagnostic labels, whereas the latter refers to a postulated spectrum disorder linking various conditions. ASD is a subset of the broader autism phenotype (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact. A revision to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5), released May 2013. The new diagnosis encompasses previous diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS. Slightly different diagnostic definitions are used in other countries. Rather than categorizing these diagnoses, the DSM-5 has adopted a dimensional approach to diagnosing disorders that fall underneath the autism spectrum umbrella. Some have proposed that individuals on the autism spectrum may be better represented as a single diagnostic category. Within this category, the DSM-5 has proposed a framework of differentiating each individual by dimensions of severity, as well as associated features (i.e., known genetic disorders, and intellectual disability). Another change to the DSM includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual with an ASD diagnosis will be described in terms of severity of social communication symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests, hyper- or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli, and associated features. The restricting of onset age has also been loosened from 3 years of age to \\"early developmental period\\", with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities. Signs and symptoms Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent challenges with social communication and social interaction, and by the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These symptoms begin in early childhood, and can impact function. There is also a unique disorder called savant syndrome that can co-occur with autism. As many as one in 10 children with autism and savant syndrome can have outstanding skills in music, art, and mathematics. Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is more common and has been found to correlate with intellectual disability. Approximately 50% of those with ASD take part in some type of SIB (head-banging, self-biting). Other characteristics of ASD include restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). These include a range of gestures and behaviors as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual for Mental Disorders. Asperger syndrome was distinguished from autism in the DSM-IV by the lack of delay or deviance in early language development. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome did not have significant cognitive delays. PDD-NOS was considered \\"subthreshold autism\\" and \\"atypical autism\\" because it was often characterized by milder symptoms of autism or symptoms in only one domain (such as social difficulties). The DSM-5 eliminated the four separate diagnoses: Asperger Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Autistic Disorder and combined them under the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Developmental course  Most parents report that the onset of autism symptoms occur within the first year of life. There are two possible developmental courses of autism spectrum disorder. One course of development is more gradual in nature, in which parents report concerns in development over the first two years of life and diagnosis is made around 3‚Äì4 years of age. Some of the early signs of ASDs in this course include decreased looking at faces, failure to turn when name is called, failure to show interests by showing or pointing, and delayed imaginative play. A second course of development is characterized by normal or near-normal development in the first 15 months to 3 years before onset of regression or loss of skills. Regression may occur in a variety of domains, including communication, social, cognitive, and self-help skills; however, the most common regression is loss of language. Childhood disintegrative disorder, a DSM-IV diagnosis now included under ASD in DSM-V, is characterized by regression after normal development in the first 3 to 4 years of life. There continues to be a debate over the differential outcomes based on these two developmental courses. Some studies suggest that regression is associated with poorer outcomes and others report no differences between those with early gradual onset and those who experience a regression period. While there is conflicting evidence surrounding language outcomes in ASD, some studies have shown that cognitive and language abilities at age may help predict language proficiency and production after age 5. Overall, the literature stresses the importance of early intervention in achieving positive longitudinal outcomes.  Social skills  Impairments in social skills present many challenges for individuals with ASD. Deficits in social skills may lead to problems with friendships, romantic relationships, daily living, and vocational success. One study that examined the outcomes of adults with ASD found that, compared to the general population, those with ASD were less likely to be married, but it is unclear whether this outcome was due to deficits in social skills or intellectual impairment. Prior to 2013, deficits in social function and communication were considered two separate symptoms of autism. The current criteria for Autism diagnosis require individuals to have deficits in three social skills: social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing and sustaining relationships. Some of the symptoms related to social reciprocity include: * Lack of mutual sharing of interests: many children with autism prefer not to play or interact with others. * Lack of awareness or understanding of other people's thoughts or feelings: a child may get too close to peers without noticing that this makes them uncomfortable. * Atypical behaviors for attention: a child may push a peer to gain attention before starting a conversation. People with autism spectrum usually display atypical nonverbal behaviors: * Poor eye contact: a child with autism may fail to make eye contact when called by name, or they may avoid making eye contact with an observer. Aversion of gaze can also be seen in anxiety disorders, however poor eye contact in autistic children is not due to shyness or anxiety; rather, it is overall diminished in quantity. * Facial expressions: they often do not know how to recognize emotions from others' facial expressions, or they may not respond with the appropriate facial expressions. * Unusual speech: at least half of children with autism speak in a flat, monotone voice or they may not recognize the need to control the volume of their voice in different social settings. For example, they may speak loudly in libraries or movie theaters.  Communication skills  Communication deficits are due to problems with social-emotional skills like joint attention and social reciprocity. Difficulties with nonverbal communication skills such as poor eye contact, and impaired use of proper facial expressions and gestures are common. Some of the linguistic behaviors in individuals with autism include repetitive or rigid language, and restricted interests in conversation. For example, a child might repeat words or insist on always talking about the same subject. ASD can present with impairments in pragmatic communication skills, such as difficulty initiating a conversation or failure to consider the interests of the listener to sustain a conversation. Language impairment is also common in children with autism, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis. Many children with ASD develop language skills at an uneven pace where they easily acquire some aspects of communication, while never fully developing others. In some cases, individuals remain completely nonverbal throughout their lives, although the accompanying levels of literacy and nonverbal communication skills vary. They may not pick up on body language or social cues such as eye contact and facial expressions if they provide more information than the person can process at that time. Similarly, they have trouble recognizing subtle expressions of emotion and identifying what various emotions mean for the conversation. They struggle with understanding the context and subtext of conversational or printed situations, and have trouble forming resulting conclusions about the content. This also results in a lack of social awareness and atypical language expression. How emotional processing and facial expressions differ between those on the autism spectrum and others is not clear, but emotions are processed differently between different partners. It is also common for individuals with ASD to communicate strong interest in a specific topic, speaking in lesson-like monologues about their passion instead of enabling reciprocal communication with whomever they are speaking to. What looks like self-involvement or indifference toward others stems from a struggle to recognize or remember that other people have their own personalities, perspectives, and interests. The ability to be focused in on one topic in communication is known as monotropism, and can be compared to \\"tunnel vision\\" in the mind for those individuals with ASD. Language expression by those on the autism spectrum is often characterized by repetitive and rigid language. Often children with ASD repeat certain words, numbers, or phrases during an interaction, words unrelated to the topic of conversation. They can also exhibit a condition called echolalia in which they respond to a question by repeating the inquiry instead of answering. Behavioral characteristics  Autism spectrum disorders include a wide variety of characteristics. Some of these include behavioral characteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning skills to difficulties creating connections with other people. They may develop these difficulties of creating connections due to anxiety or depression, which people with autism are more likely to experience, and as a result isolate themselves. Other behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations including sights, sounds, touch, and smell, and problems keeping a consistent speech rhythm. The latter problem influences an individual's social skills, leading to potential problems in how they are understood by communication partners. Behavioral characteristics displayed by those with autism spectrum disorder typically influence development, language, and social competence. Behavioral characteristics of those with autism spectrum disorder can be observed as perceptual disturbances, disturbances of development rate, relating, speech and language, and motility. The second core symptom of Autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests. In order to be diagnosed with ASD, a child must have at least two of the following behaviors: *Stereotyped behaviors ‚Äì Most children with autism perform repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand flapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or sounds. These behaviors may occur constantly or only when the child gets stressed, anxious or upset. *Resistance to change ‚Äì Children with autism spectrum also tend to have routines and rituals that they must follow, like eating certain foods in a specific order, or taking the same path to school every day. The child may have a meltdown if there is any change or disruption to his routine. *Restricted interests ‚Äì Children may become excessively interested in a particular thing or topic, and devote all their attention to it. For example, young children might completely focus on things that spin and ignore everything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a single topic, such as the weather or sports, and talk about it constantly. *Sensory Processing Disorder ‚Äì Many people with Autism have difficulty processing complex combinations of emotional and sensory stimuli. Their inability to process this information in a timely manner produces an information pile up which will trigger a stress reaction. They must be able to escape the environment causing this information pile up or their stress reaction may escalate to a severe anxiety reaction or panic attack. This will ultimately result in an autistic meltdown. *Oversensitivity ‚Äì Many people with autism are overly sensitive to loud sounds, bright lights, strong smells, or being touched. = Self-injury = Self-injurious behaviors (SIB) are common in ASD and include head-banging, self-cutting, self-biting, and hair-pulling. These behaviors can result in serious injury or death. Following are theories about the cause of self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals: * Frequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors e.g. reward in return for halting self-injurious behavior. However this theory is not applicable to younger children with autism. There is some evidence that frequency of self- injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce this behavior. * Higher rates of self-injury are also noted in socially isolated individuals with autism * Self-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present * An abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior Causes While specific causes of autism spectrum disorders have yet to be found, many risk factors identified in the research literature may contribute to their development. These risk factors include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is possible to identify general risk factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific factors. Given the current state of knowledge, prediction can only be of a global nature and therefore requires the use of general markers. Genetics Hundreds of different genes are implicated in susceptibility to developing autism, most of which alter the brain structure in a similar way As of 2018, it appeared that somewhere between 74% and 93% of ASD risk is heritable. After an older child is diagnosed with ASD, 7‚Äì20% of subsequent children are likely to be as well. If parents have a child with ASD they have a 2% to 8% chance of having a second child with ASD. If the child with ASD is an identical twin the other will be affected 36 to 95 percent of the time. If they are fraternal twins the other will only be affected up to 31 percent of the time. As of 2018, understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles to an understanding that genetic involvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a small effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare variants appeared to be CHD8, but less than 0.5% of people with ASD have such a mutation. Some ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like fragile X syndrome; however only around 2% of people with ASD have fragile X. Current research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal cells in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, synapse formation and remodeling, and excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitter balance. Therefore despite up to 1000 different genes thought to contribute to increased risk of ASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the brain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain. Some of these genes are known to modulate production of the GABA neurotransmitter which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. These GABA-related genes are underexpressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand, genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain e.g. astrocytes and microglia, respectively, are overexpressed which correlates with increased number of glial and immune cells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the mTOR signaling pathway which supports cell growth and survival. All these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autistic spectrum, however, it can not be guaranteed that they are determinants for the development. Early life Several prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism. These risk factors include maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal age over 30, bleeding after first trimester, use of prescription medication (e.g. valproate) during pregnancy, and meconium in the amniotic fluid. While research is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism, each of these factors has been identified more frequently in children with autism, compared to their siblings who do not have autism, and other typically developing youth. While it is unclear if any single factors during the prenatal phase affect the risk of autism, complications during pregnancy may be a risk. Low vitamin D levels in early development has been hypothesized as a risk factor for autism. Disproven vaccine hypothesis In 1998 Andrew Wakefield led a fraudulent study that suggested that the MMR vaccine may cause autism. This conjecture suggested that autism results from brain damage caused either by the MMR vaccine itself, or by thimerosal, a vaccine preservative. No convincing scientific evidence supports these claims, and further evidence continues to refute them, including the observation that the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from routine childhood vaccines. A 2014 meta-analysis examined ten major studies on autism and vaccines involving 1.25 million children worldwide; it concluded that neither the MMR vaccine, which has never contained thimerosal, nor the vaccine components thimerosal or mercury, lead to the development of ASDs. Pathophysiology In general, neuroanatomical studies support the concept that autism may involve a combination of brain enlargement in some areas and reduction in others. These studies suggest that autism may be caused by abnormal neuronal growth and pruning during the early stages of prenatal and postnatal brain development, leaving some areas of the brain with too many neurons and other areas with too few neurons. Some research has reported an overall brain enlargement in autism, while others suggest abnormalities in several areas of the brain, including the frontal lobe, the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, the temporal lobe, and the corpus callosum. In functional neuroimaging studies, when performing theory of mind and facial emotion response tasks, the median person on the autism spectrum exhibits less activation in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of the brain than the median member of a properly sampled control population. This finding coincides with reports demonstrating abnormal patterns of cortical thickness and grey matter volume in those regions of autistic persons' brains. Brain connectivity  Brains of autistic individuals have been observed to have abnormal connectivity and the degree of these abnormalities directly correlates with the severity of autism. Following are some observed abnormal connectivity patterns in autistic individuals: * Decreased connectivity between different specialized regions of the brain (e.g. lower neuron density in corpus callosum) and relative overconnectivity within specialized regions of the brain by adulthood. Connectivity between different regions of the brain ('long-range' connectivity) is important for integration and global processing of information and comparing incoming sensory information with the existing model of the world within the brain. Connections within each specialized regions ('short-range' connections) are important for processing individual details and modifying the existing model of the world within the brain to more closely reflect incoming sensory information. In infancy, children at high risk for autism that were later diagnosed with autism were observed to have abnormally high long-range connectivity which then decreased through childhood to eventual long-range underconnectivity by adulthood. * Abnormal preferential processing of information by the left hemisphere of the brain vs. preferential processing of information by right hemisphere in neurotypical individuals. The left hemisphere is associated with processing information related to details whereas the right hemisphere is associated with processing information in a more global and integrated sense that is essential for pattern recognition. For example, visual information like face recognition is normally processed by the right hemisphere which tends to integrate all information from an incoming sensory signal, whereas an ASD brain preferentially processes visual information in the left hemisphere where information tends to be processed for local details of the face rather than the overall configuration of the face. This left lateralization negatively impacts both facial recognition and spatial skills. * Increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere which directly correlates with severity of autism. This observation also supports preferential processing of details of individual components of sensory information over global processing of sensory information in an ASD brain. * Prominent abnormal connectivity in the frontal and occipital regions. In autistic individuals low connectivity in the frontal cortex was observed from infancy through adulthood. This is in contrast to long-range connectivity which is high in infancy and low in adulthood in ASD. Abnormal neural organization is also observed in the Broca's area which is important for speech production.  Neuropathology  Listed below are some characteristic findings in ASD brains on molecular and cellular levels regardless of the specific genetic variation or mutation contributing to autism in a particular individual: *Limbic system with smaller neurons that are more densely packed together. Given that the limbic system is the main center of emotions and memory in the human brain, this observation may explain social impairment in ASD. *Fewer and smaller Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. New research suggest a role of the cerebellum in emotional processing and language. *Increased number of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebral cortex. These cells provide metabolic and functional support to neurons and act as immune cells in the nervous system, respectively. *Increased brain size in early childhood causing macrocephaly in 15‚Äì20% of ASD individuals. The brain size however normalizes by mid-childhood. This variation in brain size in not uniform in the ASD brain with some parts like the frontal and temporal lobes being larger, some like the parietal and occipital lobes being normal sized, and some like cerebellar vermis, corpus callosum, and basal ganglia being smaller than neurotypical individuals. *Cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) that are essential to formation and maintenance of connections between neurons, neuroligins found on postsynaptic neurons that bind presynaptic CAMs, and proteins that anchor CAMs to neurons are all found to be mutated in ASD.  Gut-immune-brain axis  Role of gut-immune-brain axis in autism; BBB ‚Äì blood brain barrier Up to 70% of autistic individuals have GI related problems like reflux, diarrhea, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, and food allergies. The severity of GI symptoms is directly proportional to the severity of autism. It has also been shown that the makeup of gut bacteria in ASD patients is different than that of neurotypical individuals. This has raised the question of influence of gut bacteria on ASD development via inducing an inflammatory state. Listed below are some research findings on the influence of gut bacteria and abnormal immune responses on brain development: * Some studies on rodents have shown gut bacteria influencing emotional functions and neurotransmitter balance in the brain, both of which are impacted in ASD. *The immune system is thought to be the intermediary that modulates the influence of gut bacteria on the brain. Some ASD individuals have a dysfunctional immune system with higher numbers of some types of immune cells, biochemical messengers and modulators, and autoimmune antibodies. Increased inflammatory biomarkers correlate with increased severity of ASD symptoms and there is evidence to support a state of chronic brain inflammation in ASD. *More pronounced inflammatory responses to bacteria were found in ASD individuals with an abnormal gut microbiota. Additionally IgA antibodies that are central to gut immunity were also found in elevated levels in ASD populations. Some of these antibodies may also attack proteins that support myelination of the brain, a process that is important for robust transmission of neural signal in many nerves. *Activation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy (by gut bacteria, bacterial toxins, an infection, or non-infectious causes) and gut bacteria in the mother that induce increased levels of Th17, a proinflammatory immune cell, have been associated with an increased risk of autism. Some maternal IgG antibodies that cross the placenta to provide passive immunity to the fetus can also attack the fetal brain. One study found that 12% of mothers of autistic children have IgG that are active against the fetal brain. *Inflammation within the gut itself does not directly affect brain development. Rather it is the inflammation within the brain promoted by inflammatory responses to harmful gut microbiome that impact brain development. *Proinflammatory biomessengers IFN-Œ≥, IFN-Œ±, TNF-Œ±, IL-6 and IL-17 have been shown to promote autistic behaviors in animal models. Giving anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-17 along with IL-6 and IL-17, respectively, have been shown to negate this effect in the same animal models. *Some gut proteins and microbial products can cross the blood- brain barrier (BBB) and activate mast cells in the brain. Mast cells release proinflammatory factors and histamine which further increase BBB permeability and help set up a cycle of chronic inflammation. Mirror neuron system The mirror neuron system (MNS) consists of a network of brain areas that have been associated with empathy processes in humans. In humans, the MNS has been identified in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and is thought to be activated during imitation or observation of behaviors. The connection between mirror neuron dysfunction and autism is tentative, and it remains to be seen how mirror neurons may be related to many of the important characteristics of autism. \\"Social brain\\" interconnectivity A number of discrete brain regions and networks among regions that are involved in dealing with other people have been discussed together under the rubric of the \\"social brain\\". , there is a consensus that autism spectrum is likely related to problems with interconnectivity among these regions and networks, rather than problems with any specific region or network. Temporal lobe Functions of the temporal lobe are related to many of the deficits observed in individuals with ASDs, such as receptive language, social cognition, joint attention, action observation, and empathy. The temporal lobe also contains the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the fusiform face area (FFA), which may mediate facial processing. It has been argued that dysfunction in the STS underlies the social deficits that characterize autism. Compared to typically developing individuals, one fMRI study found that individuals with high-functioning autism had reduced activity in the FFA when viewing pictures of faces. Mitochondria ASD could be linked to mitochondrial disease (MD), a basic cellular abnormality with the potential to cause disturbances in a wide range of body systems. A 2012 meta- analysis study, as well as other population studies have shown that approximately 5% of children with ASD meet the criteria for classical MD. It is unclear why the MD occurs considering that only 23% of children with both ASD and MD present with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities.  Serotonin  Serotonin is a major neurotransmitter in the nervous system and contributes to formation of new neurons (neurogenesis), formation of new connections between neurons (synaptogenesis), remodeling of synapses, and survival and migration of neurons, processes that are necessary for a developing brain and some also necessary for learning in the adult brain. 45% of ASD individuals have been found to have increased blood serotonin levels. It has been hypothesized that increased activity of serotonin in the developing brain may facilitate the onset of autism spectrum disorder, with an association found in six out of eight studies between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by the pregnant mother and the development of ASD in the child exposed to SSRI in the antenatal environment. The study could not definitively conclude SSRIs caused the increased risk for ASDs due to the biases found in those studies, and the authors called for more definitive, better conducted studies. Confounding by indication has since then been shown to be likely. However, it is also hypothesized that SSRIs may help reduce symptoms of ASD and even positively affect brain development in some ASD patients. Diagnosis Process for screening and diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder; ASD ‚Äì Autism Spectrum Disorder; M-CHAT ‚Äì Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers; (+) ‚Äì positive test result; (-) ‚Äì negative test result ASD can be detected as early as 18 months or even younger in some cases. A reliable diagnosis can usually be made by the age of two years, however, because of delays in seeking and administering assessments, diagnoses often occur much later. The diverse expressions of ASD behavioral and observational symptoms and absence of one specific genetic or molecular marker for the disease pose diagnostic challenges to clinicians who use assessment methods based on symptoms alone. Individuals with an ASD may present at various times of development (e.g., toddler, child, or adolescent), and symptom expression may vary over the course of development. Furthermore, clinicians who use those methods must differentiate among pervasive developmental disorders, and may also consider similar conditions, including intellectual disability not associated with a pervasive developmental disorder, specific language disorders, ADHD, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. Ideally the diagnosis of ASD should be given by a team of professionals from different disciplines (e.g. child psychiatrists, child neurologists, psychologists) and only after the child has been observed in many different settings. Considering the unique challenges in diagnosing ASD using behavioral and observational assessment, specific practice parameters for its assessment were published by the American Academy of Neurology in the year 2000, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in 1999, and a consensus panel with representation from various professional societies in 1999. The practice parameters outlined by these societies include an initial screening of children by general practitioners (i.e., \\"Level 1 screening\\") and for children who fail the initial screening, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment by experienced clinicians (i.e. \\"Level 2 evaluation\\"). Furthermore, it has been suggested that assessments of children with suspected ASD be evaluated within a developmental framework, include multiple informants (e.g., parents and teachers) from diverse contexts (e.g., home and school), and employ a multidisciplinary team of professionals (e.g., clinical psychologists, neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists). , psychologists would wait until a child showed initial evidence of ASD tendencies, then administer various psychological assessment tools to assess for ASD. Among these measurements, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) are considered the \\"gold standards\\" for assessing autistic children. The ADI-R is a semi-structured parent interview that probes for symptoms of autism by evaluating a child's current behavior and developmental history. The ADOS is a semistructured interactive evaluation of ASD symptoms that is used to measure social and communication abilities by eliciting several opportunities (or \\"presses\\") for spontaneous behaviors (e.g., eye contact) in standardized context. Various other questionnaires (e.g., The Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist) and tests of cognitive functioning (e.g., The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) are typically included in an ASD assessment battery.  Screening Screening recommendations for autism in children younger than 3 years are: * US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend universal screen of young children for autism due to poor evidence of benefits of this screening when parents and clinicians have no concerns about ASD. The major concern is a false-positive diagnosis that would burden a family with very time consuming and financially demanding treatment interventions when it is not truly required. USPSTF also did not find any robust studies showing effectiveness of behavioral therapies in reducing ASD symptom severity * American Academy of Pediatrics recommends ASD screening of all children between the ages if 18 and 24 months. The AAP also recommends that children who screen positive for ASD be referred to ASD treatment services without waiting for a comprehensive diagnostic workup. * The American Academy of Family Physicians did not find sufficient evidence of benefit of universal early screening for ASD * The American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society recommends general routine screening for delayed or abnormal development in children followed by screening for ASD only if indicated by the general developmental screening * Thee American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommend routinely screening autism symptoms in young children * The UK National Screening Committee does not recommend universal ASD screening in young children. Their main concerns includes higher chances of misdiagnosis at younger ages and lack of evidence of effectiveness of early interventions  Misdiagnosis  There is a concern about significant levels of misdiagnosis of autism in neurodevelopmentally normal children. This is because 18‚Äì37% of children diagnosed with ASD eventually lose their diagnosis and this high rate of lost diagnosis cannot be accounted for by successful ASD treatment alone. The common reasons parents understood as the cause of lost ASD diagnosis were new information about child (73.5%), diagnosis given so child could receive ASD treatment services (24.2%) to treat another developmental disorder, ASD treatment success (21%), and incorrect diagnosis (1.9%). Many of the children who were later found not to meet ASD diagnosis criteria then received diagnosis for another developmental disorder like ADHD (most common), sensory disorders, anxiety, personality disorder, or learning disability. Neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders that are commonly misdiagnosed as ASD include specific language impairment, social communication disorder, anxiety disorder, reactive attachment disorder, cognitive impairment, visual impairment, hearing impairment and normal behavioral variations. Some normal behavioral variations that resemble autistic traits are repetitive behaviors, sensitivity to change in daily routines, focused interests, and toe-walking. These are considered normal behavioral variations when they do not cause impaired function. Boys are more likely to exhibit repetitive behaviors especially when excited, tired, bored, or stressed. Some ways of distinguishing normal behavioral variations from abnormal behaviors are the ability of the child to suppress these behaviors and the absence of these behaviors during sleep. Listed below are some risk factors for ASD misdiagnosis: * Children diagnosed with PDD-NOS or a mild form of ASD which may be harder to distinguish from other developmental delays * Children diagnosed with ASD whose parents had no concerns about abnormal development in their child * Initial ASD diagnosis given by generalists (e.g. pediatricians, family physicians etc.), mental health providers, and schools rather than specialists in child neurodevelopmental disorders e.g. child psychiatrists or child neurologists  Prognosis  Few children who are correctly diagnosed with ASD are thought to lose this diagnosis due to treatment or outgrowing their symptoms. Children with poor treatment outcomes also tend to be ones that had moderate to severe forms of ASD, whereas children who appear to have responded to treatment are the ones with milder forms of ASD. Comorbidity Autism spectrum disorders tend to be highly comorbid with other disorders. Comorbidity may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make intervention/treatment more difficult. Distinguishing between ASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging, because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other disorders, and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult. * The most common medical condition occurring in individuals with autism spectrum disorders is seizure disorder or epilepsy, which occurs in 11‚Äì39% of individuals with ASD. * Tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant genetic condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs, is present in 1‚Äì4% of individuals with ASDs. * Intellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. Recent estimates suggest that 40‚Äì69% of individuals with ASD have some degree of an intellectual disability, more likely to be severe for females. A number of genetic syndromes causing intellectual disability may also be comorbid with ASD, including fragile X, Down, Prader-Willi, Angelman, Williams syndrome and SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability. * Learning disabilities are also highly comorbid in individuals with an ASD. Approximately 25‚Äì75% of individuals with an ASD also have some degree of a learning disability. * Various anxiety disorders tend to co-occur with autism spectrum disorders, with overall comorbidity rates of 7‚Äì84%. Rates of comorbid depression in individuals with an ASD range from 4‚Äì58%. The relationship between ASD and schizophrenia remains a controversial subject under continued investigation, and recent meta-analyses have examined genetic, environmental, infectious, and immune risk factors that may be shared between the two conditions. * Deficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following directions, being cooperative, and doing things on other people's terms. Symptoms similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be part of an ASD diagnosis. * Sensory processing disorder is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42‚Äì88%. * Starting in adolescence, some people with Asperger syndrome (26% in one sample) fall under the criteria for the similar condition schizoid personality disorder, which is characterised by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment and apathy. Asperger syndrome was traditionally called \\"schizoid disorder of childhood\\". Management There is no known cure for autism, although those with Asperger syndrome and those who have autism and require little-to-no support are more likely to experience a lessening of symptoms over time. Several interventions can help children with Autism. The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. Although evidence-based interventions for autistic children vary in their methods, many adopt a psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive, communication, and social skills while minimizing problem behaviors. It has been argued that no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Intensive, sustained special education or remedial education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis, developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focus treatment on a specific area of deficit. Generally, when educating those with autism, specific tactics may be used to effectively relay information to these individuals. Using as much social interaction as possible is key in targeting the inhibition autistic individuals experience concerning person-to-person contact. Additionally, research has shown that employing semantic groupings, which involves assigning words to typical conceptual categories, can be beneficial in fostering learning. There has been increasing attention to the development of evidence-based interventions for young children with ASD. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and the developmental social-pragmatic model (DSP). Although ABA therapy has a strong evidence base, particularly in regard to early intensive home-based therapy, ABA's effectiveness may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ of the person affected by ASD. The Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology has deemed two early childhood interventions as \\"well-established\\": individual comprehensive ABA, and focused teacher-implemented ABA combined with DSP. Another evidence-based intervention that has demonstrated efficacy is a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. A multitude of unresearched alternative therapies have also been implemented. Many have resulted in harm to autistic people and should not be employed unless proven to be safe. However, a recent systematic review on adults with autism has provided emerging evidence for decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression through mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. In October 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposed new evidence-based recommendations for early interventions in ASD for children under 3. These recommendations emphasize early involvement with both developmental and behavioral methods, support by and for parents and caregivers, and a focus on both the core and associated symptoms of ASD. However, a Cochrane review found no evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is effective in reducing behavioral problems associated with autism in most children with ASD but did help improve IQ and language skills. The Cochrane review did acknowledge that this may be due to the low quality of studies currently available on EIBI and therefore providers should recommend EIBI based on their clinical judgement and the family's preferences. No adverse effects of EIBI treatment were found. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects. Generally speaking, treatment of ASD focuses on behavioral and educational interventions to target its two core symptoms: social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors. If symptoms continue after behavioral strategies have been implemented, some medications can be recommended to target specific symptoms or co-existing problems such as restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs), anxiety, depression, hyperactivity/inattention and sleep disturbance. Melatonin for example can be used for sleep problems. While there are a number of parent-mediated behavioral therapies to target social communication deficits in children with autism, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of interventions to treat RRBs. There is some emerging data that show positive effects of risperidone on restricted and repetitive behaviors, but due to the small sample size of these studies and the concerns about its side effects, antipsychotics are not recommended as primary treatment of RRBs. Epidemiology While rates of autism spectrum disorders are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly by gender, with boys diagnosed far more frequently than girls. The average male-to-female diagnosis ratio for ASDs is 4.2:1, with 1 in 70 boys, but only 1 in 315 girls. Girls, however, are more likely to have associated cognitive impairment. Among those with an ASD and intellectual disability, the sex ratio may be closer to 2:1. Prevalence differences may be a result of gender differences in expression of clinical symptoms, with women and girls with autism showing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis. Autism prevalence has been estimated at 1‚Äì2 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000, and PDD-NOS at 3.7 per 1,000. These rates are consistent across cultures and ethnic groups, as autism is considered a universal disorder. Using DSM-V criteria 92% of the children diagnosed with a autism spectrum disorder per DSM-IV still meet the diagnostic criteria of an autism spectrum disorder. However if both Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Communication Disorder categories of DSM-V are combined, the prevalence of autism is mostly unchanged from the prevalence per the DSM- IV criteria. The best estimate for prevalence of ASD is 0.7% or 1 child in 143 children. Relatively mild forms of autism, such as Aspergers as well as other developmental disorders were included in the recent DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. ASD rates were constant between 2014 and 2016 but twice the rate compared to the time period between 2011 and 2014 (1.25 vs 2.47%). A Canadian meta- analysis from 2019 confirmed these effects as the profiles of people diagnosed with autism became less and less different from the profiles of the general population. In the US, the rates for diagnosed ASD have been steadily increasing since 2000 when records began being kept. While it remains unclear whether this trend represents a true rise in incidence, it likely reflects changes in ASD diagnostic criteria, improved detection, and increased public awareness of autism. United States In the United States it is estimated to affect more than 2% of children (about 1.5 million) as of 2016. According to the latest CDC prevalence reports, 1 in 59 children (1.7%) in the United States had a diagnosis of ASD in 2014, reflecting a 2.5-fold increase from the prevalence rate in 2000. Prevalence is estimated at 6 per 1,000 for autism spectrum disorders as a whole, although prevalence rates vary for each of the developmental disorders in the spectrum. History Controversies have surrounded various claims regarding the etiology of autism spectrum disorders. In the 1950s, the \\"refrigerator mother theory\\" emerged as an explanation for autism. The hypothesis was based on the idea that autistic behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity, lack of warmth, and cold, distant, rejecting demeanor of a child's mother. Naturally, parents of children with an autism spectrum disorder suffered from blame, guilt, and self-doubt, especially as the theory was embraced by the medical establishment and went largely unchallenged into the mid-1960s. The \\"refrigerator mother\\" theory has since continued to be refuted in scientific literature, including a 2015 systematic review which showed no association between caregiver interaction and language outcomes in ASD. Leo Kanner, a child psychiatrist, was the first person to describe ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder in 1943 by calling it 'infantile autism' and therefore rejected the 'refrigerator mother' theory. Another controversial claim suggests that watching extensive amounts of television may cause autism. This hypothesis was largely based on research suggesting that the increasing rates of autism in the 1970s and 1980s were linked to the growth of cable television at this time. Society and culture=Caregivers Families who care for an autistic child face added stress from a number of different causes. Parents may struggle to understand the diagnosis and to find appropriate care options. Parents often take a negative view of the diagnosis, and may struggle emotionally. In the words of one parent whose two children were both diagnosed with autism, \\"In the moment of diagnosis, it feels like the death of your hopes and dreams.\\" More than half of parents over the age of 50 are still living with their child as about 85% of people with ASD have difficulties living independently.  Autism rights movement  The autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of those without autism; and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \\"high-functioning\\" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \\"low-functioning\\" autistic people. Academic performance The number of students identified and served as eligible for autism services in the United States has increased from 5,413 children in 1991‚Äì1992 to 370,011 children in the 2010‚Äì2011 academic school year. The United States Department of Health and Human Services reported approximately 1 in 68 children at age 8 are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) although onset is typically between ages 2 and 4. The increasing number of students with ASD in the schools presents significant challenges to teachers, school psychologists, and other school professionals. These challenges include developing a consistent practice that best support the social and cognitive development of the increasing number of students with ASD. Although there is considerable research addressing assessment, identification, and support services for children with ASD, there is a need for further research focused on these topics within the school context. Further research on appropriate support services for students with ASD will provide school psychologists and other education professionals with specific directions for advocacy and service delivery that aim to enhance school outcomes for students with ASD. Attempts to identify and use best intervention practices for students with autism also pose a challenge due to overdependence on popular or well-known interventions and curricula. Some evidence suggests that although these interventions work for some students, there remains a lack of specificity for which type of student, under what environmental conditions (one-on-one, specialized instruction or general education) and for which targeted deficits they work best. More research is needed to identify what assessment methods are most effective for identifying the level of educational needs for students with ASD. A difficulty for academic performance in students with ASD, is the tendency to generalize learning. Learning is different for each student, which is the same for students with ASD. To assist in learning, accommodations are commonly put into place for students with differing abilities. The existing schema of these students works in different ways and can be adjusted to best support the educational development for each student. The cost of educating a student with ASD in the US is about $8,600 a year more than the cost of educating an average student, which is about $12,000. Employment About half of people in their 20s with autism are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. Among those on the autism spectrum who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by lost productivity in the job market. Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children. Adding content related to autism in existing diversity training can clarify misconceptions, support employees, and help provide new opportunities for autistics.

Location The quarry is located in the town of Bathgate in West Lothian, Scotland. Geologically, it sits fairly central to the middle of the fossil-rich Scottish Central Lowlands. The site is dominated by volcanic tuff and limestone, and layered silica deposits, indicating the presence of a hot spring associated with volcanism.Benton, M.

Fossils The quarry was most active in the 1830s and 1840s. During these years it yielded some interesting fossils of Carboniferous plants and eurypterids, though this was not uncommon for quarries in the area. When the quarry closed, the place was forgotten until fossil hunter Stan Wood found fossils of primitive tetrapods there in 1984. The quarry was bought by Wood for fossil collection, and yielded extremely interesting finds, including a huge sample of both terrestrial and marine fossil arthropods, examples of several classes of fishes and early amphibians. The latter include multiple examples of Balanerpeton (a temnospondyl), Silvanerpeton and Eldeceeon (basal anthracosaurs). A single specimen of a small animal named Westlothiana has variously been interpreted as an anthracosaur, a proto-amniote and possibly even the oldest known reptile.Smithson, T.R. & Rolfe, W.D.I.

History Prince County Hospital traces its history to the early 1900s when it was the first hospital in Prince Edward Island to be located outside of Charlottetown. It was originally located on St. Stephen Street near Summerside's central business district but was replaced in 1951 by a facility located on Beattie Avenue. This facility was replaced in 2004 by the present facility located on a 27-acre property on Roy Boates Avenue in the city's north end. Beattie Avenue was named to honour Grace Beattie, RN who was the first administrator of the hospital. Roy Boates Avenue was named to honour Roy Boates, a previous Director of Pharmacy at the hospital. Roy owned and managed a community pharmacy in Prince Edward Island from 1949 to 1974. He served on the executive of The Canadian Pharmacists Association and was on the Executive Council of The PEI Pharmacists Association for 20 years being president twice. In 1967 he was the first person in PEI to receive the Robins Bowl of Hygeia award for community service. In 1981 he went to Gambia under the auspices of CUSO (Canadian University Service Overseas) and served as Chief Pharmacist in Gambia. He initiated, supervised and implemented a new drug system. He was responsible for two hospitals, 16 health centers, 17 dispensaries, and 54 sub dispensaries. He also opened two new medical stores stocked with supplies from the Canadian Mission Relief Fund.

The name was meant to distinguish these ships from ‚Äúprotected cruisers‚Äù which had become accepted in the 1880s. A protected cruiser did not have side armor on its hull like a battleship or ‚Äúarmored cruiser‚Äù but had only a curved armored deck built inside the ship ‚Äì like an internal turtle shell ‚Äì which prevented enemy fire penetrating through the ship down into the most critical areas such as machinery, boilers, and ammunition storage. An unprotected cruiser lacked even this level of internal protection. The definitions had some gray areas because individual ships could be built with a protective deck that did not cover more than a small area of the ship, or was so thin as to be of little value (the same was true of the side armor on some armored cruisers). An unprotected cruiser was generally cheaper and less effective than a protected cruiser, while a protected cruiser was generally cheaper and less effective than an armored cruiser (with some exceptions in each case). Note: The British classified cruisers and 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class, then sloops and gunboats. These rankings were based on size and firepower but not armor layout‚Äîin 1900 the British Royal Navy had protected cruisers ranging from the 1,800-ton to the 14,000-ton , larger than any armored cruisers or even most battleships. Also, the term \\"unarmored\\" could be used in contemporary references to mean both protected and unprotected cruisers. Examples Unprotected cruisers included medium-sized ships such as the Spanish and Chinese Kai Che down to smaller ships of about 1,000 tons. A small unprotected cruiser was little different from a large gunboat (for instance, at the Battle of Manila in 1898 the American was larger than the Spanish unprotected cruisers of the , and was equivalent to a small British protected cruiser, however the US Navy classified Concord as only a gunboat.)Conway's 1860‚Äì1905 Such ships could be known by alternate names depending on the preference of each navy. For instance, the British Royal Navy tended to refer to larger gunboats/small cruisers as ‚Äúsloops‚Äù. The designation ‚Äúunprotected‚Äù made sense only after the development of protected cruisers in the 1880s. Many ships designed earlier had essentially the same features and size range; for instance, the Spanish , the French and the Dutch ships were also to be called unprotected cruisers. Steel-hulled cruisers had been preceded by iron-hulled (but not armored) ships and composite (iron and wood)-hulled ships, which were originally termed cruisers, frigates, or corvettes. Most of these ships retained sailing rig and were useful for colonial duties, where dockyards and coal supplies were often inadequate. Some of these older ships were fairly large, for instance . The cruisers meant for colonial duty, like gunboats, were not built for high speed. The French unprotected cruiser Milan (1885) was distinct in appearance and role, with the recognition that cruisers were more useful as scouts and commerce raiders if they were faster than ironclad battleships. In the 1880s and 1890s fast, small unarmored cruisers could also be listed as ‚Äúavisos‚Äù, ‚Äúdispatch boats‚Äù (if the ship was fast enough to be useful for carrying messages, in the era before wireless), or ‚Äútorpedo cruisers‚Äù (a term derived from ‚Äútorpedo gunboats‚Äù, again the distinction being mainly of larger size). Different contemporary reference works may use more than one of these terms for the same ship. Decline All of these terms faded from use because the design of these ships became obsolete. By World War I, there was no need to produce unprotected cruisers since fast ‚Äúlight‚Äù cruisers could be given not only protective decks but side armor (over the pre-dreadnought era, effective armor could be made thinner with less weight due to advances in steelworking technology). The speed and firepower difference between even a small light cruiser and a gunboat had made these categories permanently distinct. Wireless technology had eliminated message-carrying roles, and specialized torpedo craft were made much lighter and faster (destroyers). When discarded terms such as ‚Äúsloop‚Äù, ‚Äúfrigate‚Äù and ‚Äúcorvette‚Äù were used again, it was for small anti-submarine convoy escort craft.

He was the son of Marcus Boucquet, a painter little known. Descamps supposes he must have visited Italy, as his works exhibit a manner that partakes little of the taste of his country. He painted historical subjects, and was also esteemed as a portrait painter. His works are distributed in the different churches of the towns in Flanders. They are well composed, and, like those of most of the artists of his country, are well coloured. In the great church of Nieuport are two altar-pieces by this master, one of which, representing 'The Death of St. Francis,' is particularly admired; and in the town-house there is a large picture by him, considered as his principal work, representing 'The Judgment of Cambyses.' The principal altar-piece in the church at Ostend is by Boucquet: it represents the Taking down from the Cross. He died at Furnes in 1677.

The nine tests in CFS examine various areas of cognitive function, including: * Short-term and long-term verbal memory * Short-term and long-term spatial memory * Visuomotor functioning (eye-hand coordination) * Visuospatial function * Perception * Attention, reaction time and vigilance (visual and auditory). The CFS takes advantage of the precision and rigor of computer technology, whilst retaining the wide range of ability measures demanded from a neuropsychological battery. In contrast to other cognitive test batteries and in addition to its psychometric measures, the later versions of CFS includes detailed recording of every step of the full response process in all tests (collection of qualitative data to support interpretation of every psychometric outcome).

The brothers were arrested and sentenced in 2000, being released in 2006. A power struggle within the Hamilton mafia had been the result of several attempts made on Pat's life in the 2010s, Angelo being killed in 2017, and finally Pat being killed in 2020. Early history In 1937, Angelo Musitano, who was also known as the \\"Beast of Delianova\\", fled illegally from Delianuova, Italy to Canada after killing his sister Rosa and her partner after he believed she had disgraced the family by becoming pregnant out of wedlock; he lived under the name of Jim D'Augustino upon arriving in Canada. In 1940, an Italian court convicted Angelo in absentia to 30 years in prison. In 1965, Angelo was extradited to Italy to serve his sentence. Angelo Musitano had two nephews, Anthony \\"Tony\\" and Dominic Musitano. In 1978, Dominic Musitano, owner of a Hamilton haulage company, Rocco Luppino, and Angelo Natale, president of the Ontario Haulers Association, were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion after police uncovered a protection racket on Ontario's independent trucking industry; after a five-year legal battle, they were acquitted in 1983. In January 1983, Tony was sentenced to 15 years in prison for bombing a number of businesses in Hamilton, including bakeries. While in prison, he orchestrated the murder of Toronto mobster Domenic Racco of the Siderno Group, who violated their cocaine trade agreement by dealing behind Musitano's back, and also owed the Musitano family as much as $500,000. Tony Musitano befriended inmate Billy Rankin at Millhaven Institution in Kingston who was due to be released in December that year. Giuseppe \\"Joey\\" Avignone, nephew of Tony and Dominic Musitano, often visited Tony in prison to discuss details of the plot, which were secretly recorded by the police. Rankin was released on December 7, and given \\"the okay\\" by Dominic Musitano. On December 10, 1983, Racco got into a car in front of his Mississauga apartment with Rankin, Dominic Musitano and Peter Majeste, thinking it was to discuss potential drug trade, but was taken to a railway track and killed. In March 1984, Dominic and Tony Musitano, Avignone and Rankin were arrested. Dominic Musitano received six years for being an accessory after the fact to murder. Tony Musitano, already in prison on the bombing charges, was sentenced to 12 years concurrently, Avignone got five years and Rankin was sentenced to 12 years, all three pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit murder. Tony was granted full parole in 1990. Dominic Musitano's two sons Pasquale \\"Pat\\" or \\"Fat Pat\\" and Angelo \\"Ang\\" Musitano joined their father in organized crime. By 1992, the Hamilton-Wentworth Police estimated that the family was earning $14 million per year through various aspects of illegal gaming. Pat Musitano was charged in 1992 after an attempted arson of the Collins Hotel in Dundas, Ontario, the home of eight individuals at the time. He was not convicted. Pat Musitano was president of P&L; Tire Recycling Inc. in 1992; he was found guilty of failing to make his Mount Hope tire dump conform to the Ontario fire code. According to documents obtained by the Toronto Star, \\"he and his father created a fire hazard with an illegal tire dump in Mount Hope and then tried [without success] to get $3 million to $5 million of tax dollars to clean it up\\". They were later handed a $1.8 million fine from the Ministry of the Environment for its cleanup of the site, a fine Pat dodged with a 1993 bankruptcy claim. The crime family was led by Dominic until his death on August 13, 1995 from a heart attack at the age of 57. Pat Musitano took over as boss of the family. In 1997, Pat Musitano was in charge of a sports betting ring which brought in as much as $100,000 in bets per week; his cousin Joey Avignone also led a network for distributing illegal gambling machines in bars. According to John Ross who was a Hamilton police sergeant, Pat Musitano was \\"a decidedly blue-collar mobster who loved cars, hung out in restaurants, wore dark sunglasses and dressed up in suits ... He was Tony Soprano before Tony Soprano was on television\\". Papalia hit and arrests Pat Musitano (left) and Angelo Musitano pictured in 1998. The two brothers had ordered the murder of rival mob boss Johnny Papalia. Also later in 1997, the family ordered the hits of Johnny Papalia, to whom the Musitanos owed $250,000 to cover bookmaking debts. The theory was that it was less expensive to have Papalia removed; the family paid $3,000 plus some cocaine for the hit. The family subsequently ordered the hit on Papalia's right-hand man, Carmen Barillaro. The hitman for both murders, and for the 1985 murder of Salvatore Alaimo who owed gambling money to the Musitano crime family, was Kenneth Murdock. In November 1998, Murdock pleaded guilty to three counts of second degree murder, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and named Pat and Angelo as the men who had ordered the murders; he also said that Angelo had been waiting in the vehicle outside during the Barillaro murder. The motive for the \\"hit\\" was self-protection. Pat was convinced that Barillaro would target him in retribution for the Papalia killing, so he and Murdock acted first. According to Murdock, the Musitano brothers had also been fed up with being a satellite (crew) of the Buffalo family and having to pay tribute money to the family. Murdock also claimed that he was waiting for Pat Musitano to approve the murders of four Luppino crime family members Natale Luppino and Vincenzo Luppino (the two sons of Giacomo Luppino) and Domenic Violi and Giuseppe Violi (the two sons of Paolo Violi). In a later interview with journalist Peter Edwards, Murdock claimed that Pat Musitano had \\"ordered\\" him to enter a coffee house with a machine gun to shoot all of the leaders of the Luppino-Violi group; that would probably have included Dominico and Giuseppe (Joey) Violi. Musitano's goal was to become the \\"godfather\\" in the Hamilton area, according to Murdock, who said that he did not refuse but never did proceed with the plan. Also revealed by Murdock was that Pat Musitano had discussed with Montreal mob boss Vito Rizzuto and Gaetano Panepinto about Rizzuto investing in Ontario. Eventually, the Canadian intelligence agencies were convinced that the Musitano brothers did not act alone in the murders of Johnny Papalia and Carmen Barillaro. In February 2000, the Musitano brothers were sentenced to 10 years for conspiracy in the murder of Barillaro in a plea bargain arrangement instead of their initial first-degree murder charges. No action was taken against either in relation to the Papalia or the Alaimo murder. In 2004, both brothers were denied parole. In October 2006, the Musitano brothers were both released from prison. Angelo was re-arrested in March 2007 for a parole violation. He was held in the minimum security Frontenac Institution until June 2007 when the parole board decided not to return him to prison. Murdock was also later released on parole in 2011 after serving 13 years in prison. In an interview with journalist Peter Edwards, Murdock explained the rationale for his involvement with Angelo and Pat Musitano. He had worked for their father, Domenic Musitano and said that \\"I promised to take care of his kids\\" ... that was the dumbest mistake I ever made\\". Domenic died in 1995. Angelo Musitano hit and investigation Since the brothers' release, the police had little involvement with the family for some years. Then, in September 2015, Pat Musitano's 2013 Ford Edge was set on fire in a suspected arson; his home also sustained minor damage. On May 2, 2017, Angelo Musitano was shot dead in his truck in the driveway of his home in Waterdown, Ontario, in broad daylight at the age of 39. Surveillance video showed a Ford Fusion in front of the home and a heavy-set man shooting Angelo. The vehicle was later found abandoned; it had been stolen previously. Almost two months later, on June 26, 2017, Pat Musitano's home was shot at multiple times during the night; no one was injured. Hamilton Police did not receive cooperation from the family; Pat refused police protection. Before his death, Angelo wrote a faith-based book called I Found Him, claiming that starting a family and finding religion \\"changed him.\\" According to James Dubro, \\"The underboss of Buffalo [Domenico Violi] ordered the hit on Angelo... It was a move against the Musitanos and they would have needed Buffalo's approval. On January 11, 2018, investigations into Angelo Musitano's death revealed four vehicles were involved, and that he was stalked in the days leading up to his murder. On January 23, news reports from a press conference indicated that police believed that Angelo's murder and a Woodbridge, Ontario killing of veterinary technician Mila Barberi while she sat in her car with her boyfriend, two months earlier in March 2017, not previously considered to be related, appeared to have been carried out by the same individual based on footage of the shooter and the car used from surveillance cameras at the two locations. Detective-Sergeant Peter Thom of Hamilton Police stated \\"there is similar evidence, the same MO and the black Honda coupe.\\" According to York Regional Police, Barberi was not likely the intended target. Barberi's boyfriend, Saverio Serrano, who was shot in the arm, was discovered to have connections to the 'Ndrangheta through his father, Diego Serrano of Vaughan, who was sentenced to four years and six months in prison on two counts of drugs conspiracy and one possession of proceeds of crime on January 15, 2018. The elder Serrano was an associate of crime figure, Antonio Sergi of Toronto, who was killed two weeks after Barberi's murder. Police did not find a link between Angelo's and Barberi's murders and the shooting of Pat Musitano's house in June 2017. On 13 September 2018, real estate agent Albert Iavarone was shot outside his home in Ancaster, Ontario, a similar fashion as in the Musitano murder. Sources involved in the investigation said it was possible that the shooting was in retaliation for the previous actions against the Musitano family (specifically the hit on Angelo, according to some sources). In any event, it was part of a Mafia struggle in Hamilton according to several news outlets. A Toronto Star summary added that the latest hit came in \\"the midst of a dispute between two Niagara Region groups of mobsters who are both tied to the New York State (Buffalo) mob. Iavarone had no criminal record but was known to police as an associate of known mobsters in Hamilton. However, as of 15 September 2018, police had \\"not explained his alleged connection to the criminal underworld and have not determined if it was a factor in his death\\", according to CBC News. On 20 September 2018, the police task force (Hamilton, York and RCMP under Project \\"Scopa\\") arrested Jabril Abdalla Hassan in Hamilton, and issued Canada-wide arrest warrants, and later international warrants for Michael Cudmore and Daniel Tomassetti who had both fled to Mexico in May 2017 and January 2018 respectively; a $50,000 reward for information leading to their arrests was also offered by police. Jabril Abdalla Hassan had already been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit murder in both the Musitano and Barberi murders, and attempted murder on Serrano. Cudmore was captured on surveillance camera at both murders with the same black Honda. Daniele Ranieri of Bolton, Ontario is believed to be connected to orchestrating the murders; he was found dead in Mexico in March 2018. On September 16, 2020, Cudmore was found dead in Mexico. Weakened position and hits on Pat Musitano On April 17, 2019, Tony Musitano died in Caledonia, Ontario of natural causes at the age of 72. Pat Musitano took over as the head of \\"what was once one of Hamilton's most notable crime families alongside the Papalias and the Luppinos\\". On April 25, 2019, Pat Musitano was shot four times outside his lawyer's office in Mississauga, sustaining life-threatening injuries; he was taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. By May 1, 2019, he was no longer in critical condition, and was released from hospital on May 8. A National Post report made no comment as to the probable culprits for the attempted hit on Pat Musitano, but said that the \\"family's enemies are known to include criminal groups in Hamilton, Buffalo, Montreal and elsewhere, including the Luppino and Papalia crime gangs\\". Criminology professor Stephen Metelsky of Mohawk College provided this opinion to the Spectator: > \\"Given all the extenuating circumstances leading up to this, not just his > brother's death, but his house being targeted twice, his uncle passing away > ... I think that just opened up a ripe opportunity to speed up whatever > plans were underway to make a power play into Hamilton.\\" Former Hamilton police officer Paul Manning, who specialized in organized crime, also believed that the recent death of Tony Musitano was relevant to the attempted hit on Pat Musitano. \\"I think his protection just died\\". Manning said that the Buffalo mob may have been involved but Metelsky said that it could have been part of a local turf war. CBC News said that the 2013 death of Montreal mob boss Vito Rizzuto had \\"left the Musitanos to fend for themselves\\". Court records from a 2018 matter against Domenico and Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Violi of the Luppino crime family discuss a claim that the Musitanos were supporting the Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan who have roots in Montreal and Toronto. The records also refer to a September 2017 recording made by police indicating that Pat Musitano was already a marked man at that time, but provide no indication as to who had authorized the \\"hit\\": > \\"The [police agent] stated that [he] would have thought that ‚Äòthey‚Äô would > have gotten rid of [Pat Musitano] before his brother, [Angelo Musitano, > murdered in May 2017]. D Violi stated that 'they' wanted to show [Pat > Musitano]; that it was a message, D Violi thought. They had told D Violi > that ... [Pat Musitano] would be gone; that that would be one headache out > of the way\\". A 2019 CBC News report later quoted a Mafia expert as stating that \\"Rizzuto's death paved the way for upheaval in the underworld. There's a power struggle left from the vacuum from Rizzuto\\". A report by The Hamilton Spectator discussed a \\"resurgence of Mafia violence in Hamilton and surrounding areas that has most recently included the shooting of Hamilton mob boss Pat Musitano\\" but made no connection to the Luppino family. Sources contacted by CBC News led the site to state that \\"some sort of underworld power struggle is tearing through the region, as old scores are settled and players jockey for power in a time of unrest\\". Although Pat Musitano survived the 2019 attempt on his life, \\"He was a dead man walking,\\" according to Queen's University professor Antonio Nicaso. \\"In the world of the Mafia, revenge does not lapse. ... Mobsters can hold grudges for years, quietly hunting targets and harbouring festering feelings of revenge\\". On March 2, 2020, Giorgio Barresi, a former associate of Pat Musitano who had pleaded guilty to bookmaking in 1999, was shot to death in his Stoney Creek driveway. On July 10, 2020, Pat Musitano was shot to death beside his armour-plated SUV in broad daylight in the parking lot of a Burlington shopping plaza on Plains Road East, at the age of 52. Two other individuals sustained injuries. One sustained gunshot wounds, Musitano's bodyguard John Clary; the other individual was Musitano's cousin, Giuseppe (Pino) Avignone. A retired RCMP officer later told the Toronto Star that in his opinion, Musitano was betrayed; \\"otherwise, how would the killer know where to find him?\\" Since the deaths of his protectors (Vito Rizzuto in 2013 and Tony Musitano in 2019), Pat had been \\"living on borrowed time\\", former Hamilton police detective Paul Manning told the Toronto Star. Manning also said that at the time of Pat's murder, he had made enemies due to a scam that involved attracting investors to a gravel business. Pat's life had been at risk for some years according to the Toronto Sun: \\"Pat Musitano signed his death warrant on May 31, 1997, just minutes after longtime underworld chieftain Johnny Papalia hit the sidewalk dead ...\\". On July 17, two cars were burned and the word \\"rat\\" was painted on the garage of Avignone's home in Hamilton. In an interview with CBC News, criminologist Anna Sergi provided this \\"conjecture\\" about the incident at Avignone's home: it may have been a \\"sign that mobsters think Avignone either betrayed Musitano for another gang or broke the rule of omert√† ‚Äî the Mafia's code of silence ‚Äî and is speaking with law enforcement\\". Other sources led the CBC journalist to state that there would probably be \\"continued mob violence in Hamilton ... Musitano's killers may try to take over [as the Hamilton mob] ‚Äî but no one can prove who is responsible yet\\". On July 22, London police identified human remains found on July 19 as Grant Edward Norton, an Ingersoll man who had been reported missing on July 12 by his family, and later ruled the death as a homicide. According to the Hamilton Spectator, Norton was a partner in a construction company and Pat Musitano was a minority shareholder. The firm, Havana Group Supplies, was charged with six counts of illegal dumping and had been under investigation for fraud; Norton was facing seven fraud-related charges related to the dumping. There were no charges against Pat Musitano but according to the Spectator \\"It had been alleged in a court document that Musitano was receiving under-the-table payments for loads of soil that were being dumped ... in rural Flamborough\\". The company's principal pled guilty to fraud in March 2020 but Norton failed to attend court and a warrant was out for his arrest at the time that his body was found. In 2016, Norton had been convicted of several charges after he was found in possession of illegal drugs and packaging materials. On August 20, London police announced that Norton's murder had \\"no connection whatsoever\\" to Musitano's based on a \\"mountain of information\\".

He was known mainly for his landscapes with trees, Italianate landscapes with architecture, rivers and villages, city, coast and country views and architectural scenes. Life Adriaen Frans Boudewijns was born in Brussels where he was baptized in the St Nicolas Church on 3 October 1644. He was the son of Nicolas Boudewijns and Fran√ßoise Jonquin. He married Louise de Ceul on 5 October 1664. The couple likely remained childless. On 23 November 1665 he was registered at the same time as a pupil and master of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke. He was a pupil of the landscape painter and engraver Ignatius van der Stock.Adolphe Siret, Adrien- Fran√ßois Boudewyns, in: Biographie Nationale, Volume 2, pp. 788‚Äì795, Brussels, 1868 Square in a seaside town, with Pieter Bout On 16 December 1666 Boudewijns is recorded in Paris when he entered into a 3-year contract to work in the service of the Flemish painter Adam Frans van der Meulen.Adriaen Fransz. Boudewijns at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He is recorded as working with van der Meulen on the design of 12 Gobelins representing the months for French King Louis XIV. Van der Meulen executed the smaller figures and part of the landscapes. The remainder of the landscapes was completed by Boudewijns and Abraham Genoels, another Flemish painter active in Paris. Boudewijns also travelled with Genoels to make sketches of a castle near Brussels for a design of a tapestry for the King of France. While in Paris, Boudewijns engraved many of van der Meulen's compositions. He also made engravings after the work of Genoels, the Dutch artist Jan van Hughtenburgh and his own designs.Hans Devisscher. \\"Boudewijns, Adriaen Frans.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 February 2016 Boudewijns married the sister of Adam Frans van der Meulen called Barbe or Barbara on 12 January 1670.Adam Frans van der Meulen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The couple had two children of whom the oldest named Frans became a painter. Barbe Boudewijns died on 2 March 1674. Around this time Boudewijns must have returned home. He is documented in Brussels in 1677 when he was present at the baptism of his nephew Adriaen Frans on 4 June 1677. He married a third time in Brussels in 1670. Path in the forest He had a studio in Brussels where he received in 1682 Andreas Meulebeek as his pupil and the next year Mathys Schoevaerdts. His nephew Adriaen (Frans) became his pupil in 1694. He also trained his son Frans. It is believed that he was ruined during the bombardment of Brussels, the vicious artillery bombardment of Brussels carried out by French troops on 13, 14 and 15 August 1695 which caused the destruction of a third of the buildings in Brussels. He died in Brussels on 3 December 1719. Works=General Boudewijns was a landscape artist who produced paintings, drawings and prints. All surviving paintings are believed to have been painted after his return to Brussels from Paris. From his Paris years are mainly known his tapestry designs, drawings and engravings. Only a few of his paintings are dated.Adriaen Frans Boudewyns at Van Ham Auctions He often collaborated with other specialist painters who added the figures in his landscapes. Collaborations with Charles Emmanuel Biset, Pointi√© Dupont, his pupil Matthys Schoevaerdts and most frequently Pieter Bout are recorded. Paintings Landscape with ruins Boudewijns' work combines the Northern tradition of landscape painting with the Roman classicism exemplified by Claude Lorrain and Poussin. His landscapes often show landscapes bathed in a bright southern glow, occasionally with an ancient architectural element, against a lively and naturalist sky with clouds.Boudewijns, Adriaen Fransz at the Prado These Classical idealized landscapes became Boudewijns' trademark. His meticulous rendering of trees shows the influence of Gaspard Dughet.Adriaen Frans I Boudewyns and Mathys Schoevardts for the figures, A classical landscape with travelers and a shepherd crossing a river at Galerie Jan de Maere All his landscapes are meticulously painted and often peopled with figures painted by Pieter Bout. The landscapes of Boudewijns can generally be divided into three types. The first type resembles the work of the Sonian Forest school of landscape painters such as Jacques d'Arthois and Cornelis Huysmans. These painters from Brussels had a preference for depicting sand flats with deep lying roads surrounded by trees. These compositions show the landscapes in a bright light. A second type of landscape depicts Italianate architectural elements set in a flat landscape with a row of hills as a backdrop. Finally, he made a number of village and river landscapes that recall the style of Jan Brueghel the Elder in compositional structure and technical precision. Prints Boudewijns' many prints were based on paintings or designs of Adam Frans van der Meulen, Abraham Genoels and on his own designs.

The episode was written by Jake Coburn and directed by Lee Shallat-Chemel. It aired on Monday, October 25, 2010 on the CW. Easy J focuses on the return of Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) and the consequences she faces from her short visit to Manhattan while Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) hunts her down in the hope of maintaining her social order and eschewing any possible attempts by Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) to ruin her at the same time. Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) runs into unfortunate circumstances when she discovers that her new flame is also her college professor. Plot The episode begins with a Blair Waldorf dream sequence of Wait Until Dark with her as Audrey Hepburn being attacked. However, unlike in the film, her attacker is, strangely, a blond female. Blair awakes to find Serena with an unmade bed, messy hair, and adorning the same clothes from the previous day. Serena admits to having spent the night with \\"The Cab Stealer.\\", Colin Forrester (Sam Page). However, they spent the night talking of pop art in lieu of sleeping together. Serena says she refuses to be one of the women he hands off in a cab every morning. Blair explains her dream to Serena, who believes it to be about recently becoming Chuck's active target. Blair is unsure, however, and wonders aloud why the attacker would be female. After spending the night with Nate (Chace Crawford), Juliet Sharp (Katie Cassidy) departs early so as \\"not to be late to class.\\" Nate is disappointed, hoping to have spent more time with her. Via phone, Dan (Penn Badgley) assures him it's probably the truth. As Nate ends his call with Dan, getting in line to visit his Dad in prison, he spots a sheepish Juliet. Jenny returns to New York, only to face an angry Blair ‚Äì willing to do anything to make \\"Little J\\" leave town again. On her way to class, Serena spots her fling, Colin from the night before while entering the building. Irked, Serena is further thrown off by the revelation that he is her Psychology of Business professor, a fact that threats their relationship. Blair visits the Van Der Woodsen residence and runs into Jenny. Outraged that Jenny is breaking the rules about being \\"banished,\\" and after some verbal sparring, Blair grants her \\"amnesty 'till midnight\\" if Jenny refuses to be seen while in the city. Blair seeks out Chuck at Columbia, after a brief chat with Serena about the Cab Stealer turned Professor. She asks if he knows about Jenny Humphrey's return, and warns him it will damage his reputation as well as hers if the story about Jenny's virginity is outed; however, unknown to Blair, Chuck is responsible for Jenny's return to Manhattan, and remains nonchalant about the possibility of the truth being revealed. After talking to Chuck, Blair assigns her minions to stake-out the Van Der Woodsen residence, in order to make sure Jenny doesn't violate the terms of her Manhattan amnesty. Dan and Eric (Connor Paolo) find it strange when Jenny declines going out to one of her favorite venues, so she explains to them the terms of the agreement she made with Blair. However, Jenny ultimately reveals to Gossip Girl to whom she lost her virginity, and after a confrontation with both Chuck and Blair, decides to leave town again. At the episode's end, Chuck visits Blair in her apartment, and, after agreeing that the circumstances surrounding their breakup were beyond both their controls, the two agree to end their war, before they both destroy each other.

Dense areas of gas shielded by an evaporating gas globule can be conducive to the birth of stars. Evaporating gas globules were first conclusively identified via photographs of the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. EGG's are the likely predecessors of new protostars. Inside an EGG the gas and dust are denser than in the surrounding dust cloud. Gravity pulls the cloud even more tightly together as the EGG continues to draw in material from its surroundings. As the cloud density builds up the globule becomes hotter under the weight of the outer layers, a protostar is formed inside the EGG. A protostar may have too little mass to become a star. If so it becomes a brown dwarf. If the protostar has sufficient mass, the density reaches a critical level where the temperature exceeds 10 million kelvin at its center. At this point, a nuclear reaction starts converting hydrogen to helium and releasing large amounts of energy. The protostar then becomes a star and joins the main sequence on the HR diagram.

He is founder of the StudioLab pedagogy and former director of DesignLab at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. McKenzie's main interests are in new media, performance theory, and the role of art and technology in cultural research, contemporary processes of globalization, and emerging forms of social activism.McKenzie, J. (2010). ‚ÄòJon McKenzie‚Äô . Career=Degree Throughout his career McKenzie has achieved the following degrees: BFA (with honours) at the University of Florida, Department of Fine Arts (1984); MA (with honours) at the University of Florida, Department of English (1987); and finally a PhD at the New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, Department of Performance Studies (1996). McKenzie has held a number of professional positions including; Writing Instructor, Department of English, University of Florida (1985‚Äì1987); Assistant Professor, Department of Multimedia, The University of the Arts (1999‚Äì2001); and Associate and Full Professor, Department of English, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (2006‚Äì2007); Full Professor, Department of English, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Dean's Fellow for Media and Design and Visiting Professor of English at Cornell University.Jon McKenzie, Curriculum Vitae  Influences  During his time as an undergraduate at the University of Florida McKenzie was heavily influenced by the work of Professor Gregory Ulmer and his theories of applied Grammatology. By taking film classes with Ulmer and fellow Professor Robert Ray, McKenzie began to explore art informed by theories of relativity and psychoanalysis. This led to an interest in the deconstructive and grammatological projects of Jacques Derrida. The first lesson that Ulmer taught McKenzie was that even the most critical of theories, such as Marx and Freud, came from creativity and invention. Therefore, for McKenzie theory became a form of applied conceptual art. The second lesson Ulmer taught McKenzie was to approach the classroom as a performance space, a site where materials (bodies, ideas, media) could be mixed together to create pedagogical events.McKenzie, J., ‚ÄòStudioLab Umbrella‚Äô 13.05.10 Another influence for McKenzie has been performance artist Laurie Anderson as he was fascinated by the complexity and simplicity of her work. He wrote his master's theses on Anderson's United States Parts: I-IV where he explored Anderson's multimedia performance art using Derrida's notion of grammatological, generalised writing, while also trying to explore the relation of experimental performance and the highly normative theory of performativity articulated by Lyotard. In his essay ‚ÄòLaurie Anderson for Dummies‚Äô McKenzie analyses Anderson's performance stories from the Never Bible and her CD ROM, ‚ÄòPuppet Motel‚Äô; and how they are related to his interest in performative pedagogies.McKenzie, 1997: 30-50 The years at Florida shaped McKenzie's approach to theory and life and Ulmer's teaching left a big thumbprint on his mind. ‚ÄòThe experimental approach to theory is constant, the emphasis on generalised writing, multimedia, mixing them up. Anagrammatology‚Äô. McKenzie's concepts and views on performance theory Jon McKenzie has various views on performance theory. He refers to performance as having multiple definitions: performance as spectacle, performance as a machine's effectiveness, and a government representative's performance during speeches. All these concepts are becoming ‚Äòentwined‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003; 118) due to the different paradigms involved around the phenomena in defining what is performance. McKenzie describes the whole world as becoming a ‚Äòtest site,‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003; 120) in which everything is being tested as a performance. McKenzie believes that the world is entering ‚Äòan age of global performance.' He believes that performance has become globalized and that everything can be perceived as a performance. In the article, 'Democracy‚Äôs Performance,' he notes that ‚Äòperformance practices have gone digital... merging art, activism and technology to create electronic civil disobedience‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003; 117). According to McKenzie, performance studies is constantly ‚Äòcontesting‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003; 117) and expanding its own concepts through ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003; 117) ways of teaching and research. McKenzie considers the definition of performance in light of globalization to be ‚Äòtoo American‚Äô (McKenzie, 2006; 7) because it is problematically seen as universal, where, in actuality, each piece of performance is contextually unique. Another of McKenzie's theories, influenced by the work of Judith Butler, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and Herbert Marcuse, is that performance has formed a ‚Äòperformance stratum‚Äô (McKenzie,2003;117). This stratum involves the intersection of power and knowledge; although he admits that it has not ‚Äòfully installed itself‚Äô (McKenzie, 2001; 6); he has come to this conclusion by extending Michel Foucault's theories of discipline, in which he believes there needs to be a term to explain the different degrees of performance; cultural, organizational, and technological, although this term is only new due to the emergence of the globalization of performance; which is rapidly increasing. Referencing Friedrich Nietzsche, he also suggests that Gay Science might help us to develop a methodology that can be practiced within performance by interweaving paradigms and researching different types performance. In the article ‚ÄòDemocracy‚Äôs Performance‚ÄôMcKenzie, J., 2003: 'Democracy's Performance' The Drama Review 47:117-128. he suggests that global performance contains complex forces and affects; the effects being a system of barometers including the Eurobarometer, which are a group of demographic constituencies which take public surveys based on the performance of democracy in countries and regions across the world. The thoughts expressed in the article by McKenzie are extended thoughts based on research for his book Perform or Else.McKenzie, J., 2001: Perform or Else: from discipline to Performance(London: Routledge). McKenzie notes in ‚ÄòPerformance and Global Transference‚ÄôMcKenzie, J., 2001: 'Performance and Global Transference', The Drama Review 45:5-7. that cultural performances contribute to the contemporary process of globalization. Although he generally sees the globalization of performance as having a negative impact, he does see some positive aspects, such as: the emergence of universal human rights, establishment of the world court (international court of justice), annual conferences on global warming and the AIDS crisis, and the formation of Performance Studies International, co-founded by noted American feminist scholar Peggy Phelan. A unifying theme throughout all of McKenzie's work is researching what performance might mean in an attempt to build a clear and unique single definition that sums up various paradigms in performance studies globally. It is understood that his goal by publishing materials is to create an understanding of different theorists and researchers around the world and their different understanding of terms and approach to cultural performance and help solve problematic queries regarding to the definition of performance which is increasingly difficult as the further you research the more contradicting performance becomes to its previous definitions. This is established as his mission statement within ‚ÄòIs Performance Studies Imperialist?‚Äô(McKenzie, 2006).McKenzie, J., 2006:‚ÄòIs Performance Studies Imperialist?‚Äô,The Drama Review 50:5-8.  StudioLab  In 1996 McKenzie decided to tackle the question: ‚ÄòHow does an artist perform technologically?‚Äô With this performance in mind he taught ‚ÄòElectronic Performance‚Äô as a graduate course in the summer of 1996 and then in an undergraduate workshop in the autumn. McKenzie explains that ‚Äòthe focus of both workshops was to explore electronic performance as the cross of cultural performance (such as theatre, ritual and performance art) and technological performance (ranging from clocks and answering machines to computers and the internet). McKenzie explains that both humans and technologies perform: ‚Äòinterfaces are thus always joint performances‚Äô. McKenzie believed that it was critically important for his drama students to experience and experiment with new media. Student participation is a high expectation in McKenzie's classes and he has created a framework that allows students to add their own work.McKenzie, J., Interviewed about StudioLab The StudioLab is designed to take place in studio and computer lab environments, allowing students to develop critico-creative projects and digital skills using models drawn from cultural performance: theatre, performance art, ritual and practices of everyday life. In the studio, the students work in ‚Äòbands‚Äô to collaboratively conceive and develop performative aspects of their projects. StudioLab bands contain specialised players; one student might focus on imagery, another on text and another on interactive elements. However, in the lab, the same students work in different groupings called ‚Äòguilds‚Äô to develop the electronic elements needed by the bands. Guilds are technically monochromatic, composed of specialised players such as Photoshoppers, Hypertextualists and Interactivists. Individual guild members then bring their skills back to their bands in the studio, integrating them into projects. Moving between studio and lab, band and guild, these projects unfold through the interlacing of bodies, ideas and media. McKenzie's role in this process is one of producer giving his students advice on how to mix their tracks. The interlacing of the bands and guilds was an important discovery for McKenzie, for it took the collaboration to a higher level. One project McKenzie used was ‚ÄòInterface in Everyday Life‚Äô combining performance art and Donald Norman‚Äôs work on interface design. Students were given the opportunity to pick a common interface, explore the activities the design brings forth, and create a live performance from this exploration. They then tried to translate the performance back into a Web interface. Another project is a transformation of Brenda Laurel‚Äôs Computers as Theatre, which developed a theory of human-computer interaction using Aristotle's Poetics. Students created actual and virtual events by substituting another performance form for Greek tragedy: Kabuki, solo performance, Dada, Sumo as well as the theatre of Brecht, Artuad, Schechner and LeCompte. In this interview McKenzie was asked about his opinion about the validity of collaborative student Web projects. He explained that theatre has traditionally been a collaborative activity: ‚ÄòIf dramatic writing has traditionally been a solitary activity, producing theatre has always been collaborative: actors, costume and set designers, technical crews, etc. It's this collaborative dimension that makes theatre so applicable to creating new media, which requires integrating so many different skills and media. McKenzie believes that the model of individual genius that has dominated modern aesthetics is giving way to collaborative modes of creativity. For him, all creativity is social and recombinant‚Äô. McKenzie goes on to talk about the process of updating and maintaining a large website like StudioLab. He joked that ‚ÄòMaintaining a Website was artificial life!‚Äô He explains that the joke makes sense on two levels: First, anyone who builds and maintains a site knows that it takes some effort and if you want it to be really interesting, it takes a lot of effort so much that it can take over your life for a while. Second, the joke suggests Manuel De Landa's notion of inorganic life, which teaches us something important about human-computer interfaces, namely, that there are feedback loops and machinic processes everywhere, operating in all mediums‚Äîorganic and inorganic‚Äîand doing so at very different scales and temporalities. Machinic processes are more than tools, more than mediums even: at a general level, they make up everything. In sum: StudioLab is characterised by the circulation between studio and lab environments, by collaborative learning in different sociotechnical groupings and by the mixing and fine-tuning of physical, conceptual and multimedia elements. Jon McKenzie's second book published in 2019 Transmedia Knowledge for Liberal Arts and Community Engagement: A StudioLab ManifestoMcKenzie, J.,2019:Transmedia Knowledge for Liberal Arts and Community Engagement: A StudioLab Manifesto (London: Palgrave Pivot) provides an overview of his StudioLab pedagogy. McKenzie Stojniƒá In 2017, McKenzie co-founded the media performance group McKenzie Stojniƒáhttps://www.mckenziestojnic.org together with his spouse, performance theorist and artist Aneta Stojniƒá. Their first performance, \\"Thought Action Figures EPISODE 7: THE THINKERS,\\" premiered on 23rd May 2018 at Spring Festival in Utrecht This collaboration was part of Utrecht University's program Transmissions in Motion. McKenzie Stojniƒá operated at the intersections of art & life, theory & practice, playing & reality and episteme & doxa and performed across a variety of media. The main focus and means of their collaborative work was Thought Action Figures a.k.a. TAF. TAF is an original concept conceived by Jon McKenzieThe framework of this research can be found in McKenzie's Transmedia Knowledge for Liberal Arts and Community Engagement: A StudioLab Manifesto (London: Palgrave Pivot, 2019) and developed by McKenzie and Stojniƒá in a series of lecture-performances, comics, videos, talks, publications, workshops etc. They proposed TAFs as a new mode of thinking and performing in digital age. TAFs overcome the limitations of ideation and literacy for the benefits of figuration, digitally and transmedia knowledge. McKenzie explains: ‚ÄúWith transmedia knowledge, a new image of thought emerges: Thought-Action Figures, which are to digitality what ideas are to literacy, basic forms of thought and existence (recall that Plato interpreted Being as eidos). Thought-Action Figures are not limited to human figures: animals, plants, machines, systems, processes, materialities, symbols and other abstract entities‚Äîall become thought-action figures via transmediation, movement through mediums deemed material, spiritual, cultural, etc. within different ontologies.‚ÄùMcKenzie, J.,2019:35 . Aneta Stojniƒá elaborates: ‚ÄúTAFs are figures of thought as well as concrete objects that allow us to transform and perform ideas, concepts, and knowledge across different media and in variety of forms. TAFs are always created in relation, and they always produce meaning: that is what distinguishes them from simple objects. These relations are multiple, fluid, networked, transversal, and always in motion.‚ÄùStojnic, A.,\\"Psychoanalysis and Performance: Go Figure!\\" Room: A Sketchbook for Analytic Action Published literature=Definition McKenzie's most heavily cited work is the 2001 book Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance. In his book ‚ÄòPerform or Else,' McKenzie, J., 2001: Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance (London: Routledge). McKenzie questions whether there is a single and conclusive definition capturing all types of performance. In the first part McKenzie reviews the research area Performance Studies. Including how theatre transcended into performance as well as industries and corporations emergence into performance. Due to its complexity, there is no fixed definition of performance despite its vast field of research. McKenzie attempts to find a universal and coherent definition of performance and questions whether it is feasible to do so. He then explores why and how performance has emerged as a theoretical paradigm within the past century. He proves why there is a need for a single coherent definition of performance and shows how it goes beyond a concept of theory for theatre. McKenzie's research uses the 1986 NASA Challenger Space Shuttle shuttle flight as a case study linking his theory to that of Marcuse, Lyotard and Butler, and assesses its performative qualities. He challenges himself to create a meta-performance theory called ‚Äòperfumance‚Äô (McKenzie, 2001: 232). Perfumance is a neologism from McKenzie's research into finding a global definition for performance. A perfumance incorporates the sense of smell into performance, as performance as a manifesto with an alluring smell to it, that everyone is drawn to and pulled in and trapped, due to its complex meaning. McKenzie notes that ‚Äòperfumance emits emissions of the future‚Äô (McKenzie, 2001: 232). Meaning that it can finally end the ongoing discussion battle of performance; solving the problems of global communications. Politics In a platform about performance studies Jon McKenzie gives a speech titled ‚ÄòDemocratizing Torture: Three Scenarios‚ÄôMcKenzie, J., 'Performance and Performtivity', Seminar Workshop, Institute of Performance studies, Berlin Free University, Berlin, Germany, 2005. McKenzie addresses to the participants that society is ‚Äòdictated‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:1) by performance and that people are ‚Äòjudged‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:1) on whether their actions can be tested as performance according to the State of the art. Performance he continues has become to find an ‚Äòemergence of freedom‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:1) due to the large ‚Äòundetermined‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:1) field which overlaps other fields such as institutions and processes. He continues by saying that ‚Äòeverything and everybody‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:1) is being judged by its potential in performance and theorists are now beginning to predict the new performance hierarchies. He then begins to discuss three scenarios based on this new immergence of performance and democracy and what he predicts by using these three scenarios what the future entails because of this performance. The first being an extension of today's society he calls this ‚Äòclean torture‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:2) which entails; stun guns, stress position and highly public human rights initiatives. He calls this ‚Äòtorture as usual‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:2). He addresses the second scenario as ‚Äòsociety of the spectacle of the Scaffold‚Äô (McKenzie,2005:2) of which entails politicians becoming ‚Äòsecurity obsessed‚Äô(McKenzie,2005:2) because of the increasing danger of terrorism. This meaning the theatre of torture goes public as civilians begin to support ‚Äòenhanced interrogation techniques‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:2). The final scenario McKenzie discusses is ‚ÄòA world without torture‚Äô (McKenzie, 2005:2). He explores the avenues we need to explore to abolish torture on a global mass. He argues that international human rights have helped develop clean torture techniques rather than the brutal torture techniques developed in earlier decades. Society In 2005 McKenzie wrote another article titled ‚ÄòHacktivism and Machinic Performance‚Äô in which he attempted to define both terms in context to the social climate of today. He referred to his book ‚ÄòPerform or Else‚Äô when he defines Hacktivism: ‚Äòthe emergence of political activism within digital environments, primarily but not exclusively, the Internet‚Äô.The framework of this research can be found in McKenzie's 'Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance' (London: Routledge, 2001) McKenzie's goal has been to theorise the performance of hacktivism in hope of connecting his research on electronic civil disobedience to his ongoing performance research. Whilst being interested in cultural performances such as performance art and political theatre, McKenzie has focused on the relationships between cultural performance and ‚Äòhigh performance‚Äô technologies and ‚Äòpeak performance‚Äô organisations. As well as being interested in these three performances (cultural, organisations and technological) McKenzie is most interested in performance as the defining modality of power in contemporary society. He goes on to define machinic performances as ‚Äòarising when different processes ‚Äòrecur‚Äô or communicate across diverse systems, thereby creating performances that escape subjective control and even objective analysis...They happen at multiple sites through multiple agents, both human and technological. Machinic performances pose a real challenge to study, as to research a machinic performance is perhaps to become part of it‚Äô. McKenzie suggests that two areas where machinic performance was most visible are interface design and socio-technical systems. In new media interface design is primarily in discrete human-computer interactions, such as an exchange in front of an automated teller machine (ATM) or on a web page. The machinic performance is precisely the interaction between an individual and a PC or other device, each providing the other with information. From another perspective, however, McKenzie states that all human-computer interactions are actually close-ups of larger socio-technological systems. It is not simply one person standing at an ATM: it is a customer base interacting with a financial institution or even a whole client sector interacting with a multinational banking industry. McKenzie believes that socio-technical systems perform machinically: they entail communication across diverse structures and processes, and their ‚Äòevents‚Äô are not confined to discrete times and places, but are instead distributed across many performance sites. Speech In the article ‚ÄòDemocracy‚Äôs Performance‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003), McKenzie extends his discussion and research on performance he produced in ‚ÄòPerform or Else‚Äô (McKenzie, 2001) by discussing the definition of performance further. He begins this by using George W. Bush‚Äôs speech; his announcement of war on terrorism as a performance, he tests his speech to see, according to the term performance, whether it is indeed a performance as such. McKenzie goes on to discuss how performance has become involved in a power matrix and the ‚Äòwill to power‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003: 119) performance stratum. Through discussing this he gives his theory structure by using evidence linking the idea ‚Äòthe will to become in power‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003: 119) to performance through George Bush. He does this by showing how Bush's will makes his speech become a performance as he emphasizes his democratic views in order to gain the public's faith. McKenzie argues that Bush used a weak point in America by tackling the 9/11 attacks by blaming those responsible in a historical and philosophical perspective by linking the attacks of Al Qaeda and comparing these attacks to those of Pearl Harbor. Culture In the article ‚ÄòPerformance and Global Transference‚Äô (McKenzie, 2001) McKenzie analyses the impact of globalization on cultural performances. Commenting on previous research from the article ‚ÄòDemocracy‚Äôs Performance‚Äô (McKenzie, 2003) he continues his theory by saying that the stratum he has developed to make a clearer term for performance has not been ‚Äòfully installed‚Äô (McKenzie,2003:6) this being due to the emergence of globalization and the era we are heading into of global performance. His research in performance theory has inspired performance arts groups, such as Doorika, mentioned in the feminist theory journal Women & Performance.Mckenzie.J.,1995: 'Performance, Technology and the Lecture Machine,' Women & Performance, 7: 339-342.

From 1524 to 1752, Lahore was part of the Mughal Empire. Lahore touched the zenith of its glory during the Mughal rule from 1524 to 1752. The Mughals, who were famous as builders, gave Lahore some of its finest architectural monuments, many of which are extant today. From 1524 to 1752, Lahore was part of the Mughal Empire. Lahore grew under emperor Babur; from 1584 to 1598, under the emperors Akbar the Great and Jahangir, the city served as the empire's capital. Lahore reached the peak of its architectural glory during the rule of the Mughals, many of whose buildings and gardens have survived the ravages of time. Lahore's reputation for beauty fascinated the English poet John Milton, who wrote \\"Agra and Lahore, the Seat of the Great Mughal\\" in 1670. During this time, the massive Lahore Fort was built. A few buildings within the fort were added by Akbar's son, Mughal emperor Jahangir, who is buried in the city. Jahangir's son, Shahjahan Burki, was born in Lahore. He, like his father, extended the Lahore Fort and built many other structures in the city, including the Shalimar Gardens. The last of the great Mughals, Aurangzeb, who ruled from 1658 to 1707, built the city's most famous monuments, the Badshahi Masjid and the Alamgiri Gate next to the Lahore Fort. During the 18th century, as Mughal power dwindled, Lahore was often invaded, and government authority was lacking. The great Punjabi poet Baba Waris Shah said of the situation, \\"khada peeta wahy da, baqi Ahmad Shahy da\\" ‚Äî \\"we have nothing with us except what we eat and wear, all other things are for Ahmad Shah\\". Ahmad Shah Durrani captured remnants of the Mughal Empire and had consolidated control over the Punjab and Kashmir regions by 1761.For a detailed account of the battle fought, see Chapter VI of The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan by H. G. Keene. The 1740s were years of chaos, and the city had nine different governors between 1745 and 1756. Invasions and chaos in local government allowed bands of warring Sikhs to gain control in some areas. The Sikhs were gaining momentum at an enormous rate. In 1801, the twelve Sikh misls joined into one to form a new empire and sovereign Sikh state ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article on Lahore Notes Category:History of Lahore Category:Mughal Empire ","title":"Mughal period in Lahore"},{"id":"29114254","text":"Nathalie Tauziat was the defending champion, but lost to Anna Kournikova in the semifinals.

Ecclesiastic career In 1622, at only 24 years of age, Adalbert von Harrach was elected Archbishop of Prague with dispensation for not having yet reached the canonical age. He was consecrated and ordained in 1623 in the Sistine chapel by Cardinal Marcantonio Gozzadini. In 1626 he was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Urban VIII and in 1632 he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri where he served for 12 years. He was appointed Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prassede in 1644 and participated in the Papal conclave of 1644, which elected Pope Innocent X. Adalbert von Harrach participated in the Papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII and in 1663 he was elected Bishop of Trento with permission to retain both bishoprics (the other being Prague, which he had retained). As primate to the Kingdom of Bohemia Upon being elevated to Cardinal in 1626 he was made primate of the Kingdom of Bohemia and crowned Eleonora Gonzaga, wife of Emperor Ferdinand II of Austria, the following year in 1627. He became privy counsellor to Emperor Ferdinand III in 1637 and crowned the Emperor's first wife, Empress Marie-Anne. He was named Grand Master of the Order of the Cross with the Red Star in Bohemia, Silesia, and Poland and Chancellor of the University of Prague. Adalbert von Harrach was arrested at his palace when the Swedish took over a section of Prague in the precursor conflict to the Battle of Prague and lost a significant part of his wealth. He was eventually released after intercession by cardinal Jules Mazarin before Queen Christina of Sweden, with 15,000 √©cus and a letter written by him promising not to take revenge for Adalbert von Harrach's losses.S. Miranda: Ernst Adalbert von Harrach He visited Rome rarely; so much so that when he did in 1643, Pope Urban VIII is said to have considered it a bad omen (as the cardinal would only otherwise have visited had the pope died, requiring a papal conclave).Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) As it turned out, the pope wasn't far from being correct and died the following year. He became a representative of the new Pope and the Church to a number of royal courts. On behalf of the Pope he also crowned Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans (1646); Leopold and Eleonora Gonzaga, iuniore, third wife of Ferdinand II, as king and queen of Bohemia (1655); and Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (1656). He also blessed the marriage of King Philip IV of Spain with Mariana of Austria, daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III (1648) and accompanied the new queen, in the name of the emperor, to the frontier with Italy. Although he opposed the merger of the Charles-Ferdinand University, he participated in the ceremonial formalities bringing the two academies together in 1654. Final appointments and death Adalbert von Harrach participated in the Papal conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX and upon the election of the new Pope he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. On his return from the conclave he died on 25 October 1667 and he was buried in his family's crypt in Vienna.

Anthocyanins may provide protection for the plant against insects, diseases, and ultraviolet radiation. Some of these tomatoes have been commercialized under the names \\"Indigo Rose\\" and \\"SunBlack\\". Conventional breeding While tomatoes have the genes for producing anthocyanins, these genes are typically not expressed in the fruit in most commercial varieties. The result is that the pigments are limited to leaves and stems, where they are not eaten. As of the 2012 growing season, Oregon State University developed blue tomato seeds became commercially available under the cultivar name \\"Indigo Rose\\". The blue color is produced mostly by the anthocyanin petunidin on the outside of the tomato where the fruit is exposed to direct sunlight. The shaded side of the fruit is green when unripe, red when ripe, and the inside is red or deep pink. The tomatoes are small, about 2 inches across, round, and grow in clusters of 6 to 8. Flavor is described as slightly acidic. The vines are said to be indeterminate but compact, and disease resistant. While the concentration of anthocyanins is still very low compared to other fruits like blueberries, the pigments do improve the resistance of the fruits to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Biotechnology The conventionally-bred varieties are similar to the \\"blue\\" tomatoes that have also been developed at the John Innes Centre in the UK using gene splicing techniques, incorporating genes from snapdragons to increase the anthocyanin levels. While both the conventionally-bred and the engineered varieties exhibit altered expression of the same transcription factor of the MYB gene class which controls the anthocyanin biosynthesis, the engineered variety additionally produces the pigments in the flesh of the fruit rather than just the skin. This results in almost 100-fold higher concentration of anthocyanins in the engineered fruits compared to the conventional varieties. The inventors of the GM blue tomato, Jonathan D. G. Jones and Cathie Martin of the John Innes Centre, founded a company called Norfolk Plant Sciences to commercialize the blue tomato. They partnered with a greenhouse farm in Canada to grow blue tomatoes from which to create new commercial products.John Innes Centre 25 January 2014 Press Release: Bumper harvest for GM purple tomatoes Difference from black cultivars Many other tomato cultivars have names indicative of their dark color, such as Black Krim and Cherokee purple. These colours come from an altogether different process, whereby the chlorophyll is not efficiently degraded resulting in the accumulation of the pigment pheophytin in the fruit. This pigment combined with other carotenoids in the fruit, including beta-carotene and lycopene, produces a brown or black color.

The Courtray Design Biennale Interieur () is a major international design exhibition that takes place once every two years (in even years) in the Belgian city of Courtray (Kortrijk in Dutch). The first Interieur Design Biennale took place in 1968. The Biennale is organised by the Biennale Interieur npo. During the fair, producers and designers present their innovating interior products to a broad cultural, commercial and professional audience. Over the years, the fair has introduced a number of side activities such as the YoungDesignersFair, Design at Work, Exterieur, lectures and debates. Bot generated title -->  History  The first Design Biennale was held in 1968. The event took place in the 'Halls of Kortrijk', a new exhibition complex near the E17 highway. The event became more and more international during the following decades, and so it became one of the most important design biennales in Europe with international acclaim. At the 2012 Design Biennale, the exhibition space came to the city centre for the first time. During this Biennale, not only the halls in Kortrijk Xpo, but also the brand new Arts Centre in the Buda Factory were used to exhibit new design. A shuttle service connected both exhibition spaces. The Biennale ventured even more in the heart of the city in 2014 with sublime locations such as the Buda Factory, the Buda Tower, the Broelmuseum and the Broeltowers. In 2016, Interieur will be centred around Kortrijk Xpo and the site of the Vlasmuseum in the heart of Kortrijk.  Format  The aim of the Biennale Interieur npo is to promote creativity in product development and design, through the means of a major international Biennale, which offers an overview of the most recent developments and the most successful projects in product development and design. The 2012 fair will, for the first time in its history, take place both at the Expo halls and in the city centre, where activities are planned in the Buda Design Factory.

Ferebee (1849 - AFT 1883) was an African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church preacher and author, who was born into slavery on August 18, 1849, in a place called Big Ditch, in Currituck County, North Carolina. He wrote his biography of being born into a slave family, surviving the American Civil War, his imprisonment and later work for the church. He worked while very young, and escaped at a young age. He made a life for himself in education, politics, and religion. He led a full life and, along the way, endured many sufferings and hardships. A Brief History of the Slave Life of Rev. L.R. Ferebee, London R. Ferebee, 1882, ed. 1996, webpage: UNC-Fer.  Biography = Early life and slavery  When he was still quite young, Ferebee's mother was sold because she beat her master to the ground. Ferebee was moved with his mother and two other children, and remained with his family until was old enough to render services. He was then separated from his family and employed by a man named Edwin T. Cowles. Ferebee was still extremely young when he began to work. Because of Ferebee's youth, Cowles was extremely kind to him, and would not allow for him to be abused in any way.  Freedom and education  At twelve years old, Ferebee ran away with a group of Yankees, as they were called, who delivered him to his father, Abel M. Ferebee, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Together, they stayed in Elizabeth City until the Yankees announced that they were to travel to Newbern, NC. Figuring that moving to Newbern was safer than staying in Elizabeth City with the Civil War, both the Ferebees, and a large group of colored people, moved with the Yankees. Once in Newbern, still under the care of his father, young Ferebee started attending private school at a Christian church. By the time he was fifteen, he was the top student in his class and had become assistant teacher. While his health was starting to falter, at age thirteen, and his eyesight was beginning to fail him, he decided to take up a profession in religion. Soon thereafter, he was elected Superintendent of the Sabbath School, and then elected secretary of the church and Board of Trustees. One morning, on Ferebee's accord, a young man by the name of Miles Bartlette was sent back a year, into primary school. A few days after this event, Bartlette attempted to kill Ferebee. Bartlette stabbed a dagger through Ferebee's left shoulder blade, barely missing his heart. Ferebee did survive, but was forced to stay in his home until October, when he was allowed to return to school.  Early career  In 1867, when Ferebee was eighteen, his father moved him back to Elizabeth City. The summer after his move, he was called to Nixonton to take charge of a private school. He taught here for three years, until entering himself in a normal school. He stayed in school until he had almost mastered an English education. Once he felt he was ready, he started learning law, and Latin, with Judge C. C. Pool. After he had completed his learning with Pool, Ferebee moved to teach in his own schoolhouse. He earned himself a good reputation as a teacher by the time he was twenty. He traveled to many different counties as a teacher, and soon had become a \\"swift politician\\".  Political career  Ferebee soon became a popular Republican. In 1872, he was known to be a reliable politician, and he had married a young woman who was named Lucinda Smith. He continued to dedicate his time to politics. He had, because of his outspoken opinion, made himself many enemies in his party (both men of color, and white men). In the same year, he was married, he was rallied against by his political enemies. He was accused, by his peers, of stealing money from T.P. Wilcox. Ferebee was put through many court trials, and was continually found innocent. In the summer of 1873, the Democratic nominee for the Judge in the First District, Mills L. Eure was elected. After winning the election, Eure reopened the forgery case against Ferebee. Eure would not allow for Ferebee to present any evidence that proved him innocent, and the jury found him guilty. After twenty-seven days in prison, he was moved into a penitentiary, where he was to stay for four years.  Prison  While in penitentiary, Ferebee lost none of his religious reputation. He became the prison preacher. Meanwhile, the inmates and prison guards developed a strong liking to him, and would not abuse, or let others abuse him. After staying in the penitentiary for two years, he was chosen to go to the mountains and take up work there. He got to choose which of the inmates went with him, and after stewarding and cooking for the next five months, he was released.  Religious career  After his release from prison, he became determined to receive his preaching license, and in 1877, he succeeded. One year later, he applied to join the Annual Conference of the A.M.E. Zion Church. After deliberation by the Zion Church, he was received into conference and was assigned to Winston, North Carolina. There, he held charge for one year and a half. After his time in Winston, he was ordained by the church and in 1880, he was sent to Granville County, where he held charge for two years.  Late life  Ferebee was a preacher in Winston until his church was burned down. His last station was in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he wrote the narrative of his life, entitled \\"A Brief History of the Slave Life of Rev. L.R. Ferebee, and the Battles of Life, and Four Years of His Ministerial Life. Written from Memory. To 1882\\". The date of his death, after 1883, is unknown.

He is best known for presenting music programmes on Mercia Sound, Xtra AM, Heart FM, The Arrow (radio) and Radio Caroline. He was also a continuity announcer for Central Television. Early life and career Ted Elliott was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, England, and attended Eastwood High School for Boys where he set up a small radio station in a stationery cupboard with the now BBC Radio 2 Steve Wright (DJ). The station was heard at lunchtimes over the schools PA system. After turning down the opportunity to become an assistant golf professional for a love of music, he left school at the age of 17 and joined Mother Mistro Music Publishers in London where he worked as a song plugger, securing airplay on artist releases. Following a short spell at Campbell Connelly publishers, he joined Carlin Music in 1973 (where he was known as Eddie Elliott), and achieved airplay and promotional success for many hit records including titles by Elvis Presley, The Three Degrees, Electric Light Orchestra and George Benson. His biggest success for Carlin came when he switched the B-side of a Stylistics record to become the A-side. The 'promoted' track, \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in July 1974. In 1977, he was invited to join a new music division at Chappells Music Publishers and promoted the soundtracks of Saturday Night Fever and Grease, securing airplay, TV promotion and artist interviews. Radio and TV Having become a mobile DJ at weekends and keen to try his hand as a radio presenter, Elliott joined cable station Radio Basildon in 1980 presenting a variety of programmes and providing voice-overs for commercials. This led to an invitation to join Chiltern Radio as Commercial Producer where he was responsible for writing and producing all local advertising. He then joined BRMB in Birmingham in a similar role, before joining Mercia Sound in Coventry in a dual role as Commercial Production Manager and Presenter. When BRMB and Mercia jointly created a new medium wave station ‚ÄòXtra AM,‚Äô Elliott was asked to present the night time show between 10pm and 1am as well as a specialist rock and roll show on Saturday afternoons. He also produced The Noddy Holder Show. Spin off work included shifts as a Continuity Announcer at Central Television, and Elliott eventually left Xtra AM to take a full-time position with Central ITV. He also provided the voice-over announcements on the live Friday evening programme, Central Weekend. During this period he wrote Shapes (An Introduction To Shaped Picture Disc Singles) which was published in 1993. In 1994, Elliott joined the launch team of the regional station 100.7 Heart FM and presented the morning show between 10am and 1pm. In 2001 he joined a new rock station The Arrow which broadcast nationally on DAB digital radio and the Sky radio platform and in 2009 he joined Radio Caroline. Voice-overs and production Elliott's voice is heard throughout the UK, Europe and Middle East every day on a variety of radio and television commercials, documentaries and on-hold messages. He is also in demand as a 'Voice of God', providing pre recorded or live announcements at corporate events. While continuing to write and produce countless radio campaigns for many small advertisers and large brand names, he has written commercials for, recorded and produced many notable celebrities over the years including Frankie Howerd, Kenneth Williams, Alexei Sayle, Chris Tarrant and Sean Bean. Using his experience as a music publisher, Elliot has also negotiated the licensing of many well known music tracks for TV and radio advertisers.

Biography Helena Bulaja was born in Split, Croatia. She was educated in art history and comparative literature at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. She lives in Zagreb, Croatia.  Career Bulaja is active in digital art, design, art and film since 1994. In the early days of her career she worked as art director, designer and illustrator in several Croatian computer magazines (Computerworld Croatia, Net, Vidi), and in 1995 she started her digital artist career. In 1990s her interactive art projects, mostly occupied with metaphors, tele- presence and relation of the real world and cyber-space, were featured in magazines such as Hotwired, and presented at Ars Electronica arts and technology festival's Net Art selection in Linz, Austria in 1997.Interview with Helena Bulaja, part I: Tesla had Internet in his head!, at www.body- pixel.com The cartoon Regoch (2006) by Helena Bulaja, from Croatian Tales of Long Ago. In 2000 Helena Bulaja started an animated and interactive adaptation of fairytales from the book Priƒçe iz davnine (Croatian Tales of Long Ago) written by Ivana Brliƒá-Ma≈æuraniƒá, a Croatian writer for children (\\"the Slavic Tolkien\\"), and based on the Slavic mythology. Bulaja was the originator, editor-in-chief, manager, director and designer of the project. The project was presented at more than 30 international conferences and festivals dedicated to the interactive media, animation and film, and won several awards, including FlashForward Festival 2002 in San Francisco (category story), best multimedia award at Lucca Comics and Games in 2004, at International Family Film Festival in 2007 in Hollywood,Animirana bajka Helene Bulaja nagraƒëena na IFFI-u, Jutarnji list (in Croatian) and Zagreb City Award. The interactive animated project Croatian Tales of Long Ago was a new step in exploring the relation of the digital media and classical literature and was created by eight independent teams authors from all around the world (Australia, Germany, France, USA, Canada, England, Scotland...), whose work was coordinated on the Internet. Some of the animators, directors, musicians and other authors that contributed to the project are Nathan Jurevicius, Christian Biegai, Alistair Keddie, Laurence Arcadias, Ellen McAuslan, Mirek and Paulina Nisenbaum, Sabina Hahn, Edgar Beals, Katrin Rothe, Brenda Hutchinson, Leon Luƒçev, Sabina Hahn, Erik Adigard and many others. Each of eight teams transferred one of the eight fairy tales from the original Brliƒá's book to the digital media, with the complete artistic and creative freedom. Experimental interactive animated documentary Mechanical Figures, inspired by Nikola Tesla (2006‚Äì2009) With an international team of authors, since 2006 Helena Bulaja is developing her new project, experimental interactive documentary Mechanical Figures, inspired by the Serbian-American scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla. The film will be released in different media: as a linear theatric and TV documentary, a series of short films, as well as an interactive film for the Web and mobile devices such as iPhone and iPad. In the film, stories and thoughts about Tesla and creativity are told by some of the most intriguing and inspiring artists, thinkers, writers and scientists, like the film director Terry Gilliam, musician and artist Laurie Anderson, performance artist Marina Abramoviƒá, writer Christopher Priest, new media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, actor Andy Serkis, scientist and president of Kyoto University Hiroshi Matsumoto and others. The project is also questioning film as an art form in the time of technological development and the new media, and it leads the viewer through the process of creation, following the Tesla's legacy around the world from Zagreb, through London, Paris, Budapest, New York City, to Tokyo and New Zealand, capturing the present, past and the future of technological and social development initiated by some of Tesla's inventions. The project won MEDIA support for development, as first Croatian documentary film project. Recently Helena Bulaja started the development of a new animated project for TV and interactive media, The Cat Time Stories, that also won MEDIA development support as first Croatian animation project, based on short stories about cats and people written by Croatian writer Nada Horvat. The project was selected and presented at Cartoon Forum in September 2010 in Sopron, Hungary.Jutarnji list  Works = Animated films  * Croatian Tales of Long Ago (Priƒçe iz davnine, 2002‚Äì2006), a collection of animated and interactive films based on a fairy tale book written in 1916 by Ivana Brliƒá Ma≈æuraniƒá * Regoch (2006), short animated film from the multimedia project Croatian Tales of Long Ago * The Cat Time Stories (2009 ‚Äì ongoing), animated TV series based on stories by Nada Horvat * Tesla ‚Äì The Invention of a Dream (2015 ‚Äì ongoing), 3D animated ‚Äì director & script writer Branislav Brkic * Mechanical Figure_Inspired by Tesla (2005 ‚Äì ongoing), cross media experimental documentary  Cross media project and Documentary films  * Mechanical Figures_Inspired by Tesla (2005‚Äìongoing), experimental interactive animated cross media documentary inspired by Nikola Tesla  Cross media / Multimedia  * Classics of Croatian Literature, a series of CD-ROMs (1999‚Äì2002) * Croatian Tales of Long Ago (Part I and II), interactive CD-ROMs (2003‚Äì2006) * Stribor's Forest and Neva (deluxe editions) (2007‚Äì2008) * Oncology & I (2010‚Äì2013) * Mechanical FIgures_Inspired by Tesla (2005‚Äìongoing) Awards, nominations and honours *Croatian Tales of Long Ago **FlashForward Festival 2002 San Francisco, award in category story **Net Festival 2002, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil award in category story **Golden Award of Montreux 2003, Switzerland (CD-ROM \\"Croatian Tales, Part One\\") **Lucca Comics and Games 2004, Lucca, Italy (the best multimedia work) ** International Family Film Festival 2007, Hollywood, USA (best foreign short animation for \\"Regoch\\") **Kiklop Award, Pula Book Fair 2008, in two categories: best design and best children's book (for deluxe book edition of \\"Stribor's Forest\\") **Zagreb City Award 2003 **Festival international du film d'animation 2002, Annecy, France (\\"Quest\\" by Nathan Jurevicius and \\"Stribor's Forest\\" by Alistair Keddie were in competition for the best short film for the Internet) **Ottawa International Animation Festival 2002, Canada (interactive cartoon \\"How Quest Sought the Truth\\" by Nathan Jurevicius was a finalist in the Internet Film competition) **Ars Electronica 2002, Linz, Austria (the project \\"Croatian Tales\\" was in Net Projects competition) **FilmFest Hamburg 2002, Germany (Flash Award competition finalists in two categories: \\"Yagor\\" by Mirek Nisenbaum in the category \\"linear\\", and \\"Jaglenac & Rutvica\\" by Ellen McAuslan in the category \\"interactive\\") **FlashintheCan 2002, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (\\"How Quest Sought the Truth\\" was a finalist in the category \\"Cartoon\\") **FlashintheCan festival 2003, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (the project was a finalist in the category \\"Story\\") **SXSW Interactive 2003, Austin, Texas (the project was nominated for the best Web site in category \\"animation\\") **Festival Videoformes 2003, Clermont-Ferrand, France (the Web pages of the project were a finalist of the New Media competition) **Festival SICAF 2003, Seoul, Korea (the animated films \\"Stribor's Forest\\" and \\"How Quest Sought the Truth\\" were finalists of the Internet film competition) **Future Film Festival 2004, Bologna, Italy (the interactive animated film \\"How Quest Sought the Truth\\" was in competition of \\"Future Web Festival\\" ‚Äì films for the Internet) **Anti Film Fest 2004, Prague, Czech Republic (the cartoon \\"Fisherman Plunk and His Wife\\" by Laurence Arcadias was in the competition of the festival) **Imagimer 2005, Saint-Cast-le-Guildo, Brittany, France (the cartoon \\"Fisherman Plunk\\" by Laurence Arcadias was selected for the festival competition) **Euroshorts 2006, Warsaw, Poland (the cartoon \\"Regoch\\" by Helena Bulaja was in festival competition, experimental category) **Reel Women Int.

It is currently listed on the Canadian List of Lights as Light No. 620 and can be found on the [Canadian Hydrographic Service] Chart No. 2123.Inland Waters ‚Äì 2009 List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals  Architecture  This lighthouse was one of over 500 prominent lighthouses designed and built by William P. Anderson in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Original architectural drawings from 1882 depict four floors and an attached fog bell tower accessible from the fourth floor. Two floors were designed to be finished living space for the light keeper with the lower (still existing) stone caisson used as a cellar.  Current condition  The current skeletal tower and helicopter landing pad are often populated by an invasive non-native species of cormorant and sea gulls. A noise making apparatus was installed in an attempt to scare away these birds. There is no longer a fog signal at this site. The exposed location (particularly the south side) and northerly climate produced significant stresses on the original 1885 structure including fast moving ice during the winter months. The cement that surrounded the lighthouse's current stone caisson base has eroded on the south side revealing this ongoing damage. The mortar between the stone blocks has deteriorated and is in need of repair.

It is found in Europe. Description The wingspan is 17‚Äì20 mm. Adults are on wing in June and July, with a small second generation in late August and early September in some years. From late August the larvae feed on Saxifraga ragosoi, meadow saxifrage (Saxifraga granulata) and mossy saxifrage (Saxifraga hypnoides) including cultivars. They mine a number of leaves from the base upwards and hibernate in a hibernaculum in the heart of the plant. In spring, larvae feed externally on the plant and pupation takes place outside of the mine. Distribution Stenoptilia millieridactyla is found in France, Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Italy. Accidentally introduced to Great Britain in the 1960s and expanding its range. In Derbyshire the larvae have been found feeding on cultivars of mossy saxifrage in gardens.

Liu Xia was under effective house arrest in China as her husband, Liu Xiaobo, had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. She remained under house arrest until 10 July 2018, when she was allowed to travel to Germany for medical treatment. Biography Liu was formerly a civil servant in the Beijing tax bureau, and met her husband Liu Xiaobo while part of the Beijing literary scene in the 1980s.Boelinger, Mathias (8 October 2010). \\"Wife of Nobel Peace Prize winner talks about daily struggle\\", Deutsche Welle She married Liu Xiaobo while he was imprisoned in China in a labor re- education camp in 1996. Liu prefers to lead the solitary life of an intellectual. However, being the wife of an oft-imprisoned activist, she has been forced to act as his proxy in the public arena. She has been described as her husband's \\"most important link to the outside world.\\" Because she is the wife of one of China's most prominent human rights advocates, she also personally experiences pressures from Chinese authorities for publicly voicing opinions. Since his arrest, she has lived under constant surveillance. From the time of their marriage, during his several terms in prison, she has continued to speak out, although somewhat reluctantly, on issues of human rights both on her own and on his behalf.Jailed Chinese dissident wins Nobel Peace Prize, By Bill Schiller, 8 October 2010 The StarChina dissident's wife pleads for detained husband, By Lucy Hornby, 11 February 2009, Reuters Despite the pressures, she attempts to retain a life of normality. Liu Xiaobo's last sentence, of 11 years, was imposed after he helped write the 2008 political manifesto called Charter 08. Liu Xia begged her husband to not participate in drafting the document.Nobel Peace Prize Goes to Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo, By ANDREW JACOBS and JONATHAN ANSFIELD, Published: 8 October 2010 The New York Times After initially heeding her pleas, he went forward anyway, immersing himself for three years drafting and re-drafting the document, which he later persuaded more than 300 prominent workers, Chinese Communist Party members, and intellectuals to sign. The document was later \\"signed\\" by 10,000 users on the Internet. After it was announced that her husband had won the Nobel Peace Prize while he was imprisoned for an 11-year term for calling for multiparty elections in China, Liu Xia commented that ‚ÄúFor all these years, Liu Xiaobo has persevered in telling the truth about China and because of this, for the fourth time, he has lost his personal freedom.\\" She also said that she would visit him in jail and \\"give him a big hug\\". After visiting him, however, she was placed under house arrest and her mobile number deactivated. In May 2011, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) made a statement declaring that \\"The deprivation of liberty of Liu Xia, being in contravention to articles 9, 10 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is arbitrary, and falls within categories II and III of the categories applicable to the cases submitted to the Working Group\\" and called for an immediate end to the house arrest.https://www.nchrd.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/02/G1211232.pdf In late 2012, Liu Xia spoke briefly with journalists from The Associated Press who managed to visit her apartment. A video was later uploaded to Youtube showing another brief, unauthorized visit on 28 December 2012 in which Liu Xia and several persons converse briefly in her home. On 23 April 2013, she was allowed out to see her brother's trial, which Liu Xia felt was politically motivated. Her brother's lawyers said that the purported dispute had been resolved, but was brought back into court for some reason. Human rights activist Nicholas Bequelin asserted that this trial was therefore an act of attempted intimidation by the government in order to silence Liu Xia even further. During her brief stint out of her house, where she is allowed no internet, no phone, and few visitors, she found a welcoming crowd waiting for her. She shouted to them, \\"Tell everybody that I'm not free\\"; \\"I love you. I miss you.\\"; and she blew kisses. On 19 November 2013, she filed an appeal for Liu Xiaobo's retrial, a move that's been called \\"extraordinary\\" because the action could refocus the world's attention on China's human rights record. According to her attorney, Mo Shaoping, Liu Xia visited her husband in Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning and had gained his approval before filing this motion. In December 2013, a friend of hers, Hu, told BBC that three years of house arrest had thrown Liu into deep depression and a health professional had been prescribing anti-depressant medication for her. The Silent Strength of Liu Xia is a collection of 25 black-and-white photographs Liu Xia produced between 1996 and 1999 while her husband served his second stint in a labor re-education camp. It is the only exhibition of Liu Xia's photographic work in the United States. French scholar Guy Sorman, a longtime friend of Liu Xia and her husband, transported the prints out of China and curated the exhibition at the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies at Columbia University. In 2015, a bilingual collection of Liu Xia's poetry, Empty Chairs, was published by Graywolf Press. The poems in the collection span from 1983 to 2013. After her husband's death on 13 July 2017, no one knew her whereabouts for six months, although the Chinese government openly stated that she was \\"free\\". On 2 September 2017, she was reported to have returned to her Beijing home. Frank Lu Siqing, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, successfully spoke to Liu Xia on the phone for half an hour after calling her at her home in Beijing, South China Morning Post reports.Liu Xia, wife of late Chinese Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, ‚Äòback in Beijing‚Äô, South China Morning Post  House arrest after death of Liu Xiaobo  Although Liu Xia is not generally seen as a social activist in her own right, unlike her late husband, and has never been accused or convicted of any crime, she has endured house arrest without charges and subject to 24-hour surveillance since 2010, in contravention of Article 39 of the 1982 Constitution of China, which states that \\"the freedom of movement of any law-abiding Chinese citizen shall not be infringed\\", as well as Article 252 of the Criminal Prosecution Ordinance, which states that \\"any act of violating the freedom of communication of any law-abiding Chinese citizen is strictly prohibited\\". She is denied access to a phone or a computer. Since Liu's sea burial, neither Liu Xia nor her brother has been seen amidst reports that she had been forced to go on vacation in the southern province of Yunnan, so that she would not attend a memorial for her husband on the seventh day following his death, which had been held by various people abroad. Liu's friends in mainland China were reportedly subjected to house arrest as they prepared for a memorial ‚Äì some were detained after staging ceremonies at the seaside at Dalian. Media have reported that the area in which Liu Xia's residence is situated is under heavy guard by plainclothes officials, who threaten and manhandle journalists. Although NGOs, a number of foreign leaders, notably Angela Merkel, as well as British foreign secretary Boris Johnson have spoken out for Liu and her husband, urging the lifting of all restrictions on Liu Xia after her husband's death. On the other hand, Chinese officials state that Liu Xia is in fact free, contrary to reports by Western media and Liu's claim. Jerome Cohen, a professor at New York University and an expert in Chinese law and human rights, said he believed the rulers of one- party China would be reluctant to release Liu Xia in case she became a figurehead of resistance. Cohen also argued that \\"not only should foreign governments condemn China for its violations of human rights that led to Liu Xiaobo‚Äôs imprisonment and death, but they should also press the Chinese government to give Liu Xia, who has been put under severe illegal house arrest for the past seven years, the option to leave China. If she chooses to remain in China, the Chinese government should, in accordance with its international human rights obligations, immediately lift all the oppressive conditions that she has suffered\\". UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein announced at the United Nations headquarters on 20 July 2017 that he would meet with Chinese officials to push for assurances that Liu Xia would be allowed to leave China, countering Chinese claims that raising human rights concerns amounted to interference in domestic affairs. On 25 July 2017, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio penned an open letter to Liu Xia, \\"Current U.S. law gives the President of the United States the authority to impose visa bans and to freeze the assets of any foreign citizens who suppress basic human rights; surely the Chinese government's treatment of you and your husband meets this standard.\\" As chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Rubio also requested U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to meet with Liu Xia either at the U.S. embassy or her place of residence to understand her current situation and long-term wishes.  Photo gallery  Move to Germany  After Liu Xiaobo's ocean burial, Liu Xia, ‚Äî as said her friend Liao Yiwu, Chinese poet and dissident living in exile in Germany, ‚Äî had lived a while in Dali City in Yunnan province together with her younger brother Liu Hui, and when Liu Xia's friends and family had said that she returned to Beijing on 4 August 2017, German and US diplomats tried to visit her flat but were stopped by guards. German embassy diplomats said they would try to push the Chinese government to grant freedom of movement for Liu Xia, although Chinese officials said that Liu Xia was free and could move according to the Chinese law. In May 2018, Liao Yiwu reported with Liu Xia's permission that she was suffering debilitating clinical depression, after the Beijing government had broken multiple promises that she would 'soon' be free to travel, including, in early April 2018, an arrangement made by Heiko Maas, the German Foreign Minister, to facilitate her travel to Germany. Liao Yiwu spoke with Liu Xia on telephone on 8 April 2018 and they agreed that she would try to write an application at the German Embassy, but she cried, bursting into tears, that she had neither a computer nor smartphone to do it. At the same time, Liao Yiwu promised her that he would try to pressure German politicians with the help of Nobel laureate Herta M√ºller and other artists and writers in Berlin. Liao Yiwu again called Liu Xia on 30 April 2018 and asked for permission to publish their 8 April 2018 telephone record with her desperate cries to pressure politicians and society to help her leave China. Liu Xia left China and flew to Germany for medical treatment on 10 July 2018. The same day, her younger brother, Liu Hui, remaining in China, wrote in social media WeChat, that Liu Xia flew to Europe to start her new life there, and that he was grateful to all who were helping Liu Xia these past years. Liu Hui was sentenced to 11 years in prison on fraud charges in 2013, but released in 2015 on bail with stringent conditions. Chinese human rights activist Hu Jia said that Liu Hui, by remaining in China, was used as a hostage. Liu Xia has long insisted that her younger brother should leave China with her, due to fears that Liu Hui would used in China to limit her freedom of speech abroad.

He reigned from 1533 to 1535, when he was deposed by the dominant Portuguese and exiled to India. He later became a convert to Catholicism under the name Dom Manuel.C.F. van Fraassen (1987) Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 13. Reign Tabariji was the son of Sultan Bayan Sirrullah (also known as Abu Lais) and his first and primary wife, Nyaicili Boki Raja.C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 16. Nyaicili was the daughter of the King of Tidore; her brother Mir ruled that kingdom after the death of their father in 1526, which gave her increased political leverage. The Portuguese had previously arrived from Melaka in order to secure the spice trade and built a fort on Ternate in 1522-1523. They soon came to dominate the Ternatan court and manipulated the succession. All this led to great resentment among the Ternatan elite. The Portuguese captain Vincente de Fonseca and the Ternatan regent Pati Sarangi planned to assassinate the boy king Dayal who however managed to flee to Tidore. Now Dayal's half-brother Tabariji was placed on the throne by Fonseca. His step-father Pati Sarangi acted as regent since the Sultan was barely 15 years old.Georg Schurhammer (1977) Francis Xavier: His Life, his times - vol. 2: India, 1541-1545. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 250. After two years an incident occurred where Ternatan forces, opposing the interests of the Portuguese, attacked a newly Christianized settlement on Halmahera. This motivated the new captain Trist√£o de Ataide to depose Tabariji in favor of another half-brother, Hairun in 1535.Leonard Andaya (1993) The world of Maluku. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 120-1. The ex-sultan was exiled to the center of Portuguese power in Asia, Goa. Baptism and death While in Goa he befriended the Portuguese official Jord√£o de Freitas who influenced him in his conversion to Catholic Christianity. His baptismal name was Dom Manuel which he henceforth used. In 1544 Freitas was appointed new captain in Ternate by the authorities in Goa. When he sailed for Southeast Asia to take up his new position, he brought Tabariji with him. The idea was to depose Sultan Hairun and reinstall Tabariji. With a Christian ruler over the leading Malukan kingdom, the conversion of Maluku would apparently be facilitated. Leaving Tabariji in Melaka, Freitas proceeded to Ternate where he imprisoned Hairun and the Kapita Laut (sea lord) Samarau and persuaded the notables of the kingdom to accept Tabariji back. Hairun was brought to Melaka, but just as he approached the city, Tabariji suddenly passed away on 20 October 1545. According to a rumour, Hairun had him poisoned. In his will he gave over his realm to the King of Portugal, including Ternate and the dependent islands and territories Moti, Makian, Kayoa and Moro.Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 124-5. The will was later used by the Portuguese to argue that the Ternate rulers were their lawful vassals. ReferencesSources *Moffett, Samuel Hugh (2014) A History of Christianity in Asia, Vol. 2.

Although neither Karl Marx nor Friedrich Engels described how archaeology could be understood in a Marxist conception of history, it was developed by archaeologists in the Soviet Union during the early twentieth century. Becoming the dominant archaeological theory in that country, it was subsequently adopted by archaeologists in other nations, particularly the United Kingdom, where it was propagated by influential archaeologist V. Gordon Childe. With the rise of post-processual archaeology in the 1980s and 1990s, forms of Marxist archaeology were once more popularised amongst the archaeological community. Marxist archaeology has been characterised as having \\"generally adopted a materialist base and a processual approach whilst emphasising the historical-developmental context of archaeological data.\\" The theory argues that past societies should be examined through Marxist analysis, thereby having a materialistic basis. It holds that societal change comes about through class struggle, and while it may have once held that human societies progress through a series of stages, from primitive communism through slavery, feudalism and then capitalism, it is typically critical of such evolutionary typology today. Marxist archaeologists in general believe that the bipolarism that exists between the processual and post-processual debates is an opposition inherent within knowledge production and is in accord with a dialectical understanding of the world. Many Marxist archaeologists believe that it is this polarism within the anthropological discipline (and all academic disciplines) that fuels the questions that spur progress in archaeological theory and knowledge. This constant interfacing and conflict between the extremes of the two heuristic playing grounds (subjective vs. objective) is believed to result in a continuous reconstruction of the past by scholars (McGuire 1992, 2008).  Theory = Social evolution  The Marxist conception of history‚Äîwhich originated within Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884)‚Äîholds that society has evolved through a series of progressive stages. The first of these was primitive communism, which Marxist theorists believed was held by classless, hunter-gatherer societies. According to Marxist doctrine, most of these, however, evolved into slave-based societies, then to feudal societies, and then to capitalist societies, which Marxists note is the dominant form today. However, Marxists believe that there are in fact two more social stages for human society to progress through: socialism and then communism. Marxist archaeologists often interpret the archaeological record as displaying this progression through forms of society. This approach was particularly popular in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, and as archaeologist Bruce Trigger later wrote: > The dogmatism with which Soviet social scientists adhered to this scheme > contrasts sharply with the views expressed by Marx and Engels, who were > prepared to consider multilinear models of social evolution, especially with > regard to earlier and less well understood periods of human development.  Other  Marxist archaeology places an emphasis on learning how people lived and worked in the past. In attempting to do this, Marxist archaeologists working in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and following decades denounced what they saw as \\"artifactology\\", the simple categorising of artefacts in typologies, because they believed that it took archaeological focus away from the human beings who created and used them.  History = Precedents  When they were formulating Marxism in the mid-nineteenth century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote many books on the subject of history, but wrote little about archaeology, or how it could be understood within a Marxist framework. According to Trigger, the most relevant passage that Marx made about the subject was found in his epic study of political economy, Das Kapital, in which he had written that: > Relics of by-gone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the > investigation of extinct economic forms of society, as do fossil bones for > the determination of extinct species of animals. It is not the articles > made, but how they are made, and by what instruments, that enables us to > distinguish different economic epochs. Instruments of labour not only supply > a standard of the degree of development to which human labour has attained, > but they are also indicators of the social conditions under which labour is > carried on. In the Soviet Union Marxist archaeology was first pioneered in the Soviet Union, a state run by a Marxist government, during the 1920s. Upon taking power in the Russian Empire and reforming it as a socialist republic following the 1917 revolution, the Communist Party‚Äîas a part of their general support for scientific advancement‚Äîencouraged archaeological study, founding the Russian Academy for the History of Material Culture in 1919. Soon renamed the State Academy for the History of Material Culture (GAIMK) following the re-designation of the Empire as the Soviet Union, it was centred in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), and initially followed pre-existing archaeological theories, namely culture-historical archaeology. Following the ascent to power of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union in 1924, there was an increased focus on academics bringing their findings in line with Marxist theories. As a part of this, the government prevented Soviet archaeologists from contact with their foreign counterparts, and archaeologists were encouraged to understand their information within the framework of history developed by Marx and Engels. In 1929, a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894‚Äì1976) published a report entitled For a Soviet History of Material Culture in which he outlined a framework for Marxist archaeology. Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology was criticised as being inherently bourgeois and therefore anti-Marxist, and following its publication there was a trend to denounce those archaeological ideas and work that had gone before, exemplified at the Pan-Russian Conference for Archaeology and Ethnography held in 1930. Soon, Ravdonikas and other young Marxist archaeologists rose to significant positions in the archaeological community of the Soviet Union, with notable Marxist archaeologists of this period including Yevgeni Krichevsky, A. P. Kruglow, G. P. Podgayetsky and P. N. Tret'yakov. According to later archaeologist Bruce Trigger, these young archaeologists \\"were enthusiastic, but not very experienced in Marxism or in archaeology.\\" In the 1930s, the term \\"Soviet archaeology\\" was adopted in the country to differentiate Marxist archaeology as understood by Soviet archaeologists from the \\"bourgeois archaeology\\" of other, non-Marxist nations. Allying it firmly with the academic discipline of history, this decade saw the publication of many more archaeological books in the Union, as well as the start of what would become the country's primary archaeological journal, Sovetskaya arkheologiya, and the opening up of many more archaeological units in universities. In Latin America In Latin America, a form of Marxist archaeological thought known as \\"social archaeology\\" developed during the 1970s, based primarily in Peru and Venezuela but with some influence in Ecuador. It was pioneered by Luis Lumbreras in Peru and by Mario Sanoja and Iraida Vargas in Venezuela.  In the western world  In 1935, the influential Australian archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe visited the Soviet Union. Prior to this he had already begun looking at societies from the perspective that they developed primarily through economic means, having begun to reject culture-historical archaeology in the late 1920s. According to archaeologists Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, \\"Following the upsurge in theoretical discussion that followed the initial impact of the New Archaeology, there has been a reawakening of interest in applying to archaeology some of the implications of the earlier work of Karl Marx, many of which had been re-examined by French anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s.\\"  References  Bibliography   Category:Marxist theory Category:Archaeological theory ","title":"Marxist archaeology"},{"id":"29114774","text":"Gemini Movies (previously known as Teja TV) is a Telugu language Indian Television movie channel offered by Sun Network.

It flows in a south-north direction from Lake Amaramba/Lake Chiuta and is the largest tributary of the Ruvuma River. It joins the Luambala River at . The river valley is reported to be only above sea level. North of Lake Chiuta, those on the west bank call it the Msambiti River. At one point, the Lugenda splits into several streams with islands between them, some of whom are populated such as the island Achemponda.

The tribal people, inhabiting the river valley for several thousand years, are mainly the Yao and Makua tribals. Other groups residing here are Ngoni, Marave and Matambwe people. Etymology The etymology of the word Lugenda in Yao language, a Bantu language spoken by the Yao people (East Africa) in Africa}, has the literal meaning ‚Äúa large river.‚Äù Geography Boys of Yao tribals of Central Africa in their camouflage during initiation ceremony The Lugenda River, which joins the main Ruvuma River system in its lower reaches from the south east, rises near Lake Chilwa, from the small Lake Chiuta (). The river flows for a length of before it joins the Ruvuma River at Negomano village. Its origin is marked by a narrow wooded ridge (a sand bar ridge which is high and 9,000 years old)) that separates the swamps on the southern side of Chuta Lake from the Lake Chilwa. The stream at the outlet of the Lake Amaramba is about wide. It is a swampy water body between its origin from the Chitwa Lake and Lake Amaramba. Mecula Mountain () is the central mountain in the valley. The mountain is rich in vegetation and is considered an important botanical area of the preserve in the valley. The Legunda River and Mecula Mountain are thus the important tourist destinations in Mozambique's northern province. The river has a complex flow pattern. It flows in the westerly direction through \\"Pandanus palm-braided channels\\". On the east, its flow is through rocky gorge with the entire river vanishing into \\"slot canyons\\" displaying broad sandy waterways. This is the location of the breeding colonies of globally threatened African skimmers. The headwaters of the Lugenda River are in Lakes Chilwa and Chiuta on the border between Mozambique and Malawi, from where the river flows northeast along inferred depressions ultimately joining the Ruvuma River, on the Mozambique / Tanzania border, flowing to the Indian Ocean. The flow contribution from the Lugenda River to the Ruvuma River is estimated to be . Most of the basin area of the river lies in the Niassa Province where the irrigation potential is reported to be . It is a slow-moving river and often appears, as it emerges from the Lake Amaramba, as a lake due to its large expanse of water. The river valley has fertile alluvial soil with good water resources as it is fed by many perennial streams on both banks. The perennial water sources in the valley thus have good cultivation to sustain its inhabitants. Tobacco is grown on the river banks. Wild fig and other species of trees are also found in the valley. The river is bridged at Luambala where its width is about . Mineral resources The river valley formed by the Lugenda River, which flows within deep banks, is rich in iron ore intercalated in quartz and granite rock formations. Crystallized lime carbonate is also found. Coal is extracted from two coal fields, located on both sides of the river, one close to the Pemba Bay and the other near Itule town. Iron ore is extracted from large areas to the west of the Pemba Coalfield. Gold is also found in the valley in upper reaches of the Rarico River, a tributary of the Lugenda River. History The river valley, and the Nissa Wild Life Preserve enclosed within it, has a history linked to World War I. Germans, under the command of General Von Lettow-Vorbeck, crossed the Ruvuma River at Negomano and entered the Portuguese held Mozambique in search of food for his troops. In December 1917, after crossing the river, the general with his army marched south along the Lugenda River and arrived at Metarica. One of the battalions dispatched towards the Mecula Mountain in search of food had to fight a fierce battle with the Portuguese. Witnesses to this battle are seen in the form of a few graves on the hill slopes at Mecula, the district capital of Nissa. Ecology Lugenda River Valley, formed by the river, is part of the rich ecological corridor comprising the Messalo and Rurumana Lugenda, Messalo and Rumana rivers, which form the Niassa National Reserve and Lurio conservation area. This route is being developed for game and ecotourism envisaging fishing, wildlife viewing, boat rides and so forth. An inselberg Lugenda Wilderness Camp, which is part of the Wildlife Preserve, is on the eastern bank of the Lugenda river, amongst the Ngalongue Mountains (inselbergs); inselberg is a common international term used to define isolated rock hill, knob, ridge, or small mountain that rises abruptly from a gently sloping or virtually level surrounding plain.Inselberg, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 29 Nov. 2009. The camp is an integral component of the African wildlife ecosystem. Safaris are arranged from this camp for visits to the African wilderness. The camp has 16 east-African styled tents, a well turned out accommodation for visitors. Pemba Airport is the nearest airport to the Wilderness Camp and air services are operated by CFA Air Charters with light aircraft. At the eastern edge of the river, the camp has dirt roads, fairly well maintained for the purpose of safari tours to facilitate wild life tracking. Canoeing is a popular sport in the river, apart from climbing of the inselbergs in the park area from the \\"bush fly camps\\" along the river. There is also a proposal to set up another ecotourism camp on the Lugenda River, about away from Lichinga. ;Fauna and flora African wild dogs Niassa Reserve, named after the province where it is situated, covers an area of . It has the endemic Johnston‚Äôs impala, Niassa wildebeest and Boehm‚Äôs zebra. The reserve also has wild dogs and 800 to 1000 lions. It has 400 species of birds, out of which four species are globally threatened. Taita falcon, southern banded snake-eagle, African skimmer and Starling‚Äôs woodpecker are the bird species found, apart from the rare African pitta. Forty species of fish have been recorded in the river, which sustains a substantial fishing industry providing economic sustenance to the local people. It has a rich population of hippos. Crocodiles are reported in deep pools in the river. Canoe safari is reported to be a success. A new species known as girdle lizard has been recorded. The mountainous forests of the preserve harbour a large number of silver hornbills, buffalo and herds of wild elephants. Black heron, black rough- winged swallow, emerald-spotted dove, green-winged glossy starling, iladadah, little egret, Shelley's francolin, South African pochard, and spot-headed weaver also frequent the area. The Niassa Preserve as such is formed of 95% of the preserve‚Äôs biomass is vegetation. It has 21 types of plant species and 191 species of trees and shrubs.

She was also served in the British intervention in Russia in 1919, and was scuttled in the Dvina River on 16 September 1919. Design Intended as a shore bombardment vessel, M27s primary armament was a single 9.2 inch Mk VI gun removed from the HMS Theseus. In addition to her 9.2 inch gun she also possessed one 12 pounder and one six pound anti-aircraft gun. She was equipped with a four shaft Bolinder two cylinder semi-diesel engine with 560 horse power that allowed a top speed of eleven knots. The monitor's crew consisted of sixty nine officers and men. Construction HMS M27 ordered in March, 1915, as part of the War Emergency Programme of ship construction. She was laid down at the Sir Raylton Dixon & Co. Ltd shipyard in March 1915, launched on 8 September 1915, and completed in November 1915. World War 1 M27 served with the Dover Patrol from December 1915 to December 1918. In early 1916, M27 had her main 9.2in gun removed, as it was required for artillery use on the Western Front, and a QF MK I/II gun from HMS Redoubtable was fitted in lieu. This was later replaced by a MK VII gun. Russia M27 next saw service, along with five other monitors (M23, M25, M31, M33 and HMS Humber), which were sent to Murmansk in May 1919 to relieve the North Russian Expeditionary Force. Prior to departure to Russia, M27 had her main armament replaced by a BL triple Mk IX gun, and her 12pdr (76mm) QF Mk 1 gun replaced by a QF AA gun. In June, 1919, M27 moved to Archangel and her shallow draught enabled her to travel up the Dvina River to cover the withdrawal of British and White Russian forces. M27 and her sister ship M25 were unable to be recovered when the river level fell and were scuttled on 16 September 1919 after running aground. References * *Dittmar, F. J. & Colledge, J.

Muscat, and starring Val Kilmer and Dylan Neal. Kilmer plays a stranger who walks into a small town's police station, confesses to murder, and is interrogated by detective Alexander Black (Neal). Filmed in Canada. Plot A stranger walks into a small town's police station during a rainstorm on Christmas Eve. He tells the desk sergeant that he wishes to confess to murder, after which the desk sergeant points a handgun at him and calls for his colleagues to restrain him with handcuffs. The stranger refuses to reveal his name, preferring to be known as \\"Mr. Nobody.\\" After the stranger provokes them, the officers are about to assault him as detective Alexander Black walks in. The stranger states that he will confess to six murders, and when he describes each murder, the officers graphically die in the same way he explains though the stranger himself remains incarcerated. While the officers panic, the stranger notices a dedication text on detective Black's golden-metal pen and remarks upon it, drawing the suspicion of Detective Black, who received the pen from his murdered daughter, Mary Black. The officers think that the stranger could be a suspect whom they arrested a year ago when they were investigating the disappearance of Mary Black. Unable to prove his guilt, they tortured and beat him to get a confession, though he continually maintained his innocence. However, they realize that the victim of their violence should still be in a coma that resulted from their brutal torture, stationed at a medical facility. The officers telephone the facility and discover that the victim had died earlier that evening, at the same time as the stranger entered the police station, which proves that the stranger is not who they thought he is. Despite this new evidence, the officers believe that the stranger is a vengeful spirit of the previously tortured man. Detective Black talks about superstition and his experiences in Gulf War, while the remaining officers continue to die in ways that mirror the acts they committed against the now-dead suspect a year earlier, until only detective Black remains. Detective Black apologizes to the stranger for killing an innocent suspect, but the stranger says that he was the one who murdered his daughter. Detective Black then stabs his daughter's golden-metal pen inside his own ears to avoid hearing the stranger's confession. Black's dead daughter then appears. She tells him she knows the name of the stranger and whispers into his deaf ear. Black shoots the stranger with a shotgun and causes him to fall through a window. After the stranger's death, Christmas Day arrives and Detective Black sees his daughter leave up the stairs, presumably leaving to the afterlife.

Great Inn) ( Meg√°lo Pandoche√≠o) is the largest caravansarai on the island of Cyprus and is considered to be one of the finest buildings on the island.. Located in the capital of Cyprus, it was built by the Ottomans in 1572, the year after they had seized Cyprus from the Venetians. In the centre of the open courtyard is a mosque with a fountain for pre-prayer ablutions. It became the first city prison under British administration. After spending most of the 1990s being restored, the inn has been revived as a thriving arts centre, consisting of several galleries and workshops. There are also several courtyard cafes and souvenir shops..  History  According to historical records, the building was built in 1572 under the auspices of Muzaffer Pasha, the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, and was modelled after Koza Han in Bursa. The building was reportedly built upon the remains of an older one. However, archaeologist Tuncer Baƒüƒ±≈ükan attributes the construction of the inn to his successor, Sinan Pasha, as Muzaffer Pasha had been appointed as the governor of Tripolitania on 26 August 1571. There is one surviving letter from Selim II about the inn, where, upon being informed that some shops had been demolished to build a caravansarai, he ordered that if the caravansarai was not profitable for the vakƒ±f, it should be demolished and replaced with new shops.. Journalist Ahmet Tolgay, however, has written that Muzaffer Pasha ordered the construction and oversaw the groundbreaking of the building before being executed. According to ƒ∞sl√¢m Ansiklopedisi, Muzaffer Pasha requested an architect for the reconstruction of Cypriot fortresses from Constantinople. The architect that was sent, named Bostan, could have constructed B√ºy√ºk Han. Initially, the caravansarai was known as \\"Yeni Han\\", \\"the New Inn\\". It also became known as \\"Alanyalƒ±lar Hanƒ±\\", \\"the Inn of those from Alanya\\", as it was frequented by merchants from Alanya. However, when the smaller Kumarcilar Han was built opposite the Asmaaltƒ± Square, it became known as \\"the Great Inn\\" (B√ºy√ºk Han) in the 17th century. Upon the British takeover in 1878, the inn was restored for use as a prison. It was used as the Central Prison of Nicosia between 1892 and 1903, when the prison was moved to a new building west of the Pedieos. In the years 1900 and 1901, when the British administration left the building, the shops at the back were extended up to the point where they met the road, with the permission of the Evkaf Administration. Between 1903 and 1947, the building was used as an inn. Between 1947 and 1962, it became a refuge for poor families where they could rent rooms cheaply..  Architecture  The inn has two floors and a more or less square shape; its dimensions are 50.67 m by 45.25 m. There is a large inner courtyard which is surrounded by the rooms that have colonnades with cross vaults in front. There are 68 rooms in both floors, with the ones at the ground floor being historically used for commerce and the ones at the first floor historically used for accommodation. There are also 10 one-storey shops behind the colonnade at the eastern entrance.. The entrance to the inn is through two doors at the east and the west. The main door is located at the eastern side and opens to Asmaaltƒ± Square. There are hexagonal or octagonal stone chimneys placed above fireplaces in each room; Rupert Gunnis found these chimneys idiosyncratic and claimed that they could originate from the medieval building that once stood at the site. In the middle of the inner courtyard is a special type of masjid known is Turkish as k√∂≈ük mescidi (\\"mansion masjid\\"). The stones that were used to build this masjid are believed, according to Baƒüƒ±≈ükan, to have come from other buildings. The masjid corresponds to similar masjids built in Anatolian caravansarais such as Koza Han in Bursa or R√ºstem Pa≈üa Hanƒ± in Edirne during the 13th‚Äì17th centuries. In 1927, George Jeffery noted that the masjid was used as a hayloft. There is a grave that lies to the southwest of the masjid. This grave is traditionally held to belong to either a high-standing person who died whilst worshipping in the masjid or Muzaffer Pasha himself who is traditionally held to be executed. However, Baƒüƒ±≈ükan draws attention to the pasha's appointment to Tripolitania and says that it is a myth that he is buried there. The grave was historically used as a place for offering, though this use ended \\"a long time ago\\"..

Located in the Nyasa plateau, it is north of Lake Chiuta. The lakes are separated by a sandy ridge and a channel links the two lakes. On the western side of the channel, the connecting waterway is known as the River Msambiti while on the eastern side, it is known as the Lugenda River.

At its upstream end, Lake Chiuta feeds it through a long link channel. During the rainy season, the two lakes become one mass of water spread area. The outlet of the lake leads to the Lugenda River, which in turn joins the Rovuma River, a larger river system. The Amaramba Lake exhibits a feature of a wide river. However, the lake has a narrow width as compared to the Lake Chiuta on the upstream which has a triangular shape. The lake waters are a sustaining source of fresh water for the people in the region for growing crops and providing the means of inland transportation. The combined lakes, during the annual flood season, also make the land fertile through deposition of enriching silt. Flora and fauna Lake Amaramba shown feeding into the Lugenda River at the bottom The lake system (both Chiuta and Amaramba) had in the past very rich wild life but during the civil war suffered severe poaching and hunting. Aqua fauna in the lake also suffered due to overfishing caused by migrants from Malawi. Following this destruction, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Oxfam GB initiated measures to stop the illegal practices. A participatory approach involving people of the area, the local and provincial government and the Coastal Security Commission, was evolved to address the adverse ecological aspects created in the past, with the objective of enhancing production from the lake system without resorting to overuse of the resources of the lake. ;Revival measures The five-year programme envisaged for revival of resources of the ecosystem of Lake Chiuta-Amaramba area, through a participatory approach, involves several measures. The first of these is to prevent resource overuse and introduce measures for increasing productivity to enhance economic conditions of the community thriving on the lake's resources. Establishing a formal lake reserve in Lake Chiuta-Amaramba would preserve the lake's fish and waterbirds and would increase aquatic resources for rightful use by the local community. Also of importance would be establishing checks and balances on the quality and quantity of produce removed from the lake. Protection of the surrounding forest area through an appropriate wildlife management mechanism would permit for diversification of wildlife species which would promote the base structure of the rural livelihood. The final revival measure of the program consists of creating an environment to market local products. History In 1882, Henry E. O'Neill, H.B.M. Consul to Mozambique and 1885 recipient of the Royal Geographical Society Gold Medal, surveyed the area and subsequently published, Journey from Mozambique to Lake Shirwa, and discovery of Lake Amaramba itemizing nine villages and hamlets, named after their chiefs, at the lake's shores. Five of these were upon the eastern (Napulu, Cheinlola, Chekungwa, Chemaunda and Chengogwe), three upon the western (Akumhumbwa, Chemina and Chemataka), and one was located at the northern extremity (Akamtundu). The south-eastern shore of the lake is populated by Lomwe Makua. Currently, the nearest town to the lake is Cacova on its western side. ReferencesBibliography * Further reading * Thieme, Michelle L.

They follow the Rule of St Benedict, and co-operate with the apostolic mission of the Church through educational activities and hospitality. There are eight monasteries of nuns in six countries, united by a central Government. History=The Cistercian Order In the 11th century, three Benedictine monks, Ss Robert of Molesme, Alberic and Stephen Harding, sought to follow the Rule of St. Benedict in all its fulness. Along with a group of other monks who shared this vision of simplicity, austerity and fraternal life, they went to C√Æteaux in Burgundy, where the 'New Monastery' was established in March 1098. They became known as Cistercians. The new monastery struggled at first, but in 1112, St. Bernard arrived with 30 of his male relatives and friends. Their arrival was to give Citeaux new life and energy. Soon the monastery grew so much that new foundations were made, including Clairvaux in 1115, of which St. Bernard was to be the Abbot. Although St. Bernard was not one of the founders, he was to play a key role in the development of the new Order. By the time of his death in 1153, there were 353 monasteries of the order throughout Europe. Many women wished to follow the Cistercian ideal and many houses were established including several in French Flanders. The French Revolution and the Bernardines of Esquermes Manuscript from Notre Dame des Pres, Douai, showing St Bernard and a nun The Abbeys of Notre Dame de la Brayelle at Annay (1196), Notre Dame de la Woestine at St. Omer (1217), and Notre Dame Des Pr√®s in Douai (1221) were three Cistercian houses for women in Flanders. In common with many monasteries in the area, the sisters were known as Bernardines. Following the French Revolution in 1789, the three abbeys were suppressed in 1792. Their goods were confiscated and the members dispersed. However this was not to be the end of the Cistercian ideal for three determined sisters. Dame Hippolyte Lecouvreur (1747‚Äì1828) from Les Pr√®s, together with her blood sister Dame Hombeline Lecouvreur (1750‚Äì1829) from Annay and Dame Hyacinthe Dewismes (1760‚Äì1840) from La Woestine met together in 1799 with the sole aim of re-establishing their Cistercian life. They settled in the small village of Esquermes, a suburb of Lille. Here they were able to begin to live their monastic life again. As a way of earning a living and to show their utility in a r√©gime that was still hostile to religious, the sisters opened a school. Before the Revolution, two of the Abbeys had had small schools for the education of young girls, so this work was in direct continuity with their origins. Educational activities remain part of the charism of the Bernardines to this day. In 1806, building work began on the new monastery. It took 30 long years to reestablish their official statutes and interior rule which drew heavily on their Cistercian customs. The official erection of the Monastery of Notre Dame de la Plaine took place on May 28, 1827. By this time they had been joined by several other women, including two nuns from their former abbeys.  The First Hundred Years Esquermes in the 19th CenturyThe sisters were joined by many young women who shared in their ideals and the ‚Äònew‚Äô monastery grew. A young chaplain who exercised disproportionate power in the life of the community imposed his own rule of life on the community, preventing them from following some of their Cistercian usages but the sisters clung to their customs and lived their Cistercian Rule in secret. In 1846, at the invitation of the Archbishop of Cambrai, they established a monastery and school in that town. During this time, the schools and monasteries at Esquermes and Cambrai prospered, and had a considerable influence in the area. However anticlericalism persisted in France, and the sisters foresaw the possibility of further difficulties with the authorities. This led them to found ‚Äòrefuge‚Äô communities, first in Belgium (Ollignies, 1883), and then in Slough in England (1897), Bonsecours in France (1904). The original intention at Esquermes had never been to establish a congregation, but the founding of new monasteries required new structures and new Constitutions, which were approved by Rome in 1909. In 1904, following anticlerical laws, the sisters were expelled from Esquermes and took refuge in the other houses of the Order. Ollignies in Belgium became the Mother House.  Later Developments The new code of Canon Law of 1917 opened the door for the Bernardines to refind their Cistercian identity. New Constitutions were approved in 1937, which recognized the Bernardines as Cistercians. In 1955, official approval from Rome enabled the sisters to take Solemn Vows as Cistercian nuns. Spiritual links with both the Cistercians of the Strict Observance and the Common Observance were firmly established. Following the call of Pope Pius XII, monasteries were founded in Hamamatsu, Japan (1954) and Goma, Congo (1960). The Bernardines were able to return to France and the Mother House was transferred to the Monastery of Notre Dame de La Plaine, St Andr√©-lez-Lille (1948).  Spirituality= Cistercian Spirituality and Vows Hyning CommunityBernardine Cistercians follow Christ according to the Gospel, guided by the Rule of St Benedict. Written in the sixth century, the Rule sets out a way of seeking God in community, through a life of prayer and service of others. The Opus Dei or Divine Office is central to the day. Cistercians seek God together, having all things in common, living in simplicity, in relative silence and solitude. Hospitality is a key Benedictine value; those who arrive at the monastery to share in the prayer and peace are never turned away. The writings of the Cistercian Fathers and Mothers, particularly those of the 12th and 13th century including St Bernard and St Aelred transmit the values of the founding Cistercians and continue to be a source of spiritual riches for the Bernardines today. Bernardines Cistercians make the three traditional Benedictine vows : STABILITY ‚Äì a commitment to live where God calls, rooted in the Gospel; OBEDIENCE ‚Äì accepting to listen to the voice of God and others and to be under the authority of a Prioress, and mutual obedience to the others in the community; CONVERSION OF LIFE ‚Äì the turning of one‚Äôs whole life to God, striving to become more Christ-like. Included in this are consecrated chastity and poverty. The Blessed Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, has an important role in the spirituality of the Order. Contemplation of the Virgin Mary in the light of scripture leads to contemplation of the mysteries of Christ. All Bernardine monasteries are dedicated to Our Lady. Prayer The Divine Office at the Monastery of Our Lady of Hyning Liturgical and personal prayer is at the heart of the life of the Bernardine Cistercians. The sisters meet five times daily for the Offices of Lauds (morning prayer) Terce (at about 9 a.m) Midday Prayer, Vespers (Evening prayer) and Vigils before retiring. The last Office of the day, Vigils, combines both the elements of traditional Vigils, (night watching in the hope of the coming day) and Compline (thanking God for the day that has passed and praying for a peaceful night.) The office of Vigils ends with the singing of the Salve Regina by candlelight. Each morning, the Sisters are united around the table of the Eucharist at Mass, which is the source and summit of the day. Liturgical prayer is nourished by personal prayer. Lectio Divina, the prayerful and meditative reading of scripture, opens the sisters to the Word of God and allows it to act in their lives. Considerable time each day is allocated to Lectio Divina and other forms of personal prayer.  Structures= Government The General CouncilThe historical development of the Bernardine Order resulted in it having a central government, based at the Mother House at the Monastery of Notre Dame de La Plaine, St Andr√©-lez-Lille. The Prioress General is responsible for the overall administration of the order, aided by a General Council of four other sisters, the Secretary General and the Bursar General. Together they look at important issues arising in the order. Each Community has a local Prioress who is responsible for the day-to-day running of her own community; she is assisted by a local council. A General Chapter of the order takes place every six years at which the Prioress general and her Council are elected. The Chapter consists of the Prioresses of all communities, the general Council, the Secretary General and the Bursar General and elected delegates of the monasteries. The Chapter also debates important issues. It holds the supreme authority of the Order; in between chapters, this authority is delegated to the Prioress general and her Council. The monasteries are not autonomous, and sometimes sisters move between communities according to need.  Formation First Vows of a SisterFormation of new candidates takes place in their own country. After a period of enquiring, a candidate can be admitted as a postulant. The postulancy lasts between six months and two years. She then becomes a novice, for a further eighteen months to two years. During these stages, the person is initiated into the life and traditions of the Order and with the help of the Novice Mistress, seeks to discern if this is what God is calling her to. The novice may then make a commitment as a vowed sister (profession) for a period of time between three and nine years. She is known as a Junior Professed. At the end of the period of temporary profession, the Junior Professed then makes Solemn Profession, committing herself to follow God in the Bernardine Cistercian way of life until death. Current monasteries The Church at La Plaine, the Mother House There are currently eight Bernardine monasteries: *Monastery of Notre-Dame-de-la-Plaine (Mother House) Saint-Andr√©-lez-Lille, France *monast√®re Notre-Dame-des-Petites-Roches, Saint-Bernard-du-Touvet, Is√®re, France *Monastery of Stella Maris, Mikkabi, Japan *Monastery Notre Dame du Lac, Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo *Monastery of Our Lady of Hyning, Warton, near Carnforth, England *Monastery of Our Lady of Bafor, Di√©bougou, Burkina Faso *Monastery of Our Lady and St Bernard, Brownshill, Stroud, England A prefoundation in Asia.  Activities icon Studio The search for God through a life of prayer is the first activity of all Bernardine monasteries, but each monastery also has a variety of activities. The key Benedictine principles of education and hospitality remain at the heart of the charism of the Order. Two monasteries have schools, and other monasteries maintain educational activities through leading retreats, catechesis, writing icons and initiating others in this art, spiritual accompaniment etc. All Bernardine monasteries have guest houses were guests can share in the peace and prayer of the community and have a break from the business of everyday life. Other activities, according to community, include raising animals, (cows, poultry, sheep), kitchen garden, making altar breads, secretarial work, monastic shops, and the usual work of administration and maintenance that is found in any community.  Oblates and Lay Associates Two Bernardine Oblates make their commitment, Le Touvet Lay people who wish to deepen their faith by drawing from the riches of Cistercian spirituality may become oblates of any Bernardine community. A temporary promise is made, followed by a life promise to live the Christian life inspired by the Rule of St Benedict. The practical living out of this commitment is adapted to the life and circumstances of each oblate, but in general they remain in close contact with one of the monasteries. Groups of Lay Cistercians are also emerging in some countries.

The condition impacts much of a patient's life, including personal safety, memory, and views by others. Those who have active seizures live with the fact that they can have a seizure at any time. Those whose seizures are controlled by medication live with the underlying side effects and the need to remember to take the medication at the correct times. Mental health=Cognition Most people with epilepsy have normal cognition levels at most times. When not during or immediately proceeding a seizure, a person with epilepsy generally is physically and mentally capable of everything a non-disabled person can do. But a seizure can be disruptive to the process of normal life. During the seizure, depending on the type, the patient may be totally or partially unconscious, and out of commission to perform normal activities. Following the seizure the patient may be confused and disoriented for a period of time. The patient may also require rest after the seizure.Epilepsy: Information for You and Those Who Care about You By Elaine Wyllie: page 122 Following a seizure, many people do not have memory of a period of time immediately before the seizure. Depression Depression is very common among people with epilepsy, with rates as high as 20% for those whose seizures are successfully controlled, and 60% for those with uncontrolled seizures. Suicide is ten times as likely for people with epilepsy than it is for others.Epilepsy: Information for You and Those Who Care about You By Elaine Wyllie: page 124 Personal safety Personal safety is a major concern for persons with epilepsy. When sudden loss of consciousness occurs without warning, the patient is at risk for personal injury and possibly causing injury to others through loss of control or awareness of one's own body. Many activities of daily living can be dangerous for people with epilepsy, such as bathing, cooking, or walking up or down steps. These can be remedied by taking showers as opposed to tub baths, cooking with a microwave oven rather than an open flame, and living on a ground level.Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: pages 258 Certain high-risk sports, such as swimming, scuba diving, or snorkeling are considered dangerous for people with epilepsy. But they pose a level of danger for all participants. They can be equally safe for people with epilepsy and others if carried out with proper safety precautions.Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: pages 257-58 Driving The operation of a motor vehicle can be hazardous for people with epilepsy because the driver can lose consciousness behind the wheel, and therefore, control of the vehicle, putting themselves and the public at risk. For those whose seizures are successfully controlled, many of the medications have side effects that cause drowsiness, also impacting driving. As a result, many countries and states place restrictions on driving such as a necessity to be seizure-free for a period of time before being allowed to drive. Social issues Epilepsy can have tremendous social issues for patients. Social acceptance from others is a common challenge. Though persons with epilepsy are otherwise just like anyone else, there are stigmas associated with epilepsy that can affect one's acceptance among others. Depression is common due to impaired social acceptance. Employment Many people with epilepsy have trouble with employment due to safety performing job duties, loss of work time during and after seizures, and transportation to and from a place of employment. Children with epilepsy The social stigma can stand in the way, as the child is more prone to bullying.Epilepsy: The Ultimate Teen Guide By Kathlyn Gay, Sean McGarrahan: page 42 Epilepsy can force a child to be left out of activities common for children to be involved in, such as sports.Epilepsy: The Ultimate Teen Guide By Kathlyn Gay, Sean McGarrahan: page 44 Epilepsy can affect a child's education. The child may be forced to miss a lot of school due to seizures. The seizures can impair a child's ability to memorize learning materials.

Culiac√°n, Sinaloa  Carlos Arellano F√©lix was born in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. The city of Culiac√°n belongs to the capital of Sinaloa estado (state), northwestern Mexico (Culiacan, 2019). Culiac√°n is situated on a small coastal plain approximately 200 feet above sea level (Culiacan, 2019). It lies on the Culiac√°n River, approximately 50 miles inland from Gulf California. Culiac√°n is known to be a significant early base for Spanish expeditions and now is a regional commercial and service centre for a variety of manufactured goods (Culiacan, 2019). Culiac√°n also offers financial and administrative support for mines in the mountains that extract minerals such as zinc, gold and lead. Goods grown on crops within the valley are exported to the United States (Culiacan, 2019). The Tijuana drug cartel was originally formed in the 1960s in Sinola, Mexico, predominately delivering heroin and marijuana from Sinaloa to the United States (Jones, 2016).

They are cosmopolitan in distribution and are distinguished from others in the superfamily by a combination of characters. Like all other planthoppers, they suck phloem sap of plants. Some species are known to communicate with vibrations through the plant stems. Communication may be with mates, or with ants that tend the nymphs, protecting them and gathering honeydew secretions. Adults of some species have brightly coloured forewings which are tougher and known as tegmina unlike the membranous hindwings which are used for flight. Although a few can be identified by their coloration, most species requires dissection and examination under a microscope with access to literature on already described species. There are two sub-families within the family. In the subfamily Flatinae, the body of adults is flattened laterally and the tegmina are tent-like. In the Flatoidinae, the body is not laterally compressed and the tegmina are not as tent-like and sometimes held horizontally. The wing venation is distinctive in that the veins in the anal region are nodose, and the costal area has numerous cross veins. The antennae are small and the first segment is collar-like and small. The second segment is longer and ends in a bulge and a flagellum arises from it. They have two ocelli. Nymphs have a tail of waxy filaments.

That is, a complex number z_0\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} belongs to the escaping set if and only if the sequence defined by z_{n+1} := f(z_n) converges to infinity as n gets large. The escaping set of f is denoted by I(f). For example, for f(z)=e^z, the origin belongs to the escaping set, since the sequence :0,1,e,e^e,e^{e^e},\\\\dots tends to infinity.  History  The iteration of transcendental entire functions was first studied by Pierre Fatou in 1926 The escaping set occurs implicitly in his study of the explicit entire functions f(z)=z+1+\\\\exp(-z) and f(z)=c\\\\sin(z). The first study of the escaping set for a general transcendental entire function is due to Alexandre Eremenko who used Wiman-Valiron theory . He conjectured that every connected component of the escaping set of a transcendental entire function is unbounded. This has become known as Eremenko's conjecture. There are many partial results on this problem but as of 2013 the conjecture is still open. Eremenko also asked whether every escaping point can be connected to infinity by a curve in the escaping set; it was later shown that this is not the case. Indeed, there exist entire functions whose escaping sets do not contain any curves at all.  Properties  The following properties are known to hold for the escaping set of any non-constant and non-linear entire function. (Here nonlinear means that the function is not of the form f(z)=az+b.) * The escaping set contains at least one point. * The boundary of the escaping set is exactly the Julia set. In particular, the escaping set is never closed. * For a transcendental entire function, the escaping set always intersects the Julia set. In particular, the escaping set is open if and only if f is a polynomial. * Every connected component of the closure of the escaping set is unbounded. * The escaping set always has at least one unbounded connected component. * The escaping set is connected or has infinitely many components. * The set I(f)\\\\cup {\\\\infty} is connected. Note that the final statement does not imply Eremenko's Conjecture. (Indeed, there exist connected spaces in which the removal of a single dispersion point leaves the remaining space totally disconnected.)  Examples = Polynomials  A polynomial of degree 2 extends to an analytic self-map of the Riemann sphere, having a super- attracting fixed point at infinity. The escaping set is precisely the basin of attraction of this fixed point, and hence usually referred to as the **basin of infinity**. In this case, I(f) is an open and connected subset of the complex plane, and the Julia set is the boundary of this basin. For instance the escaping set of the complex quadratic polynomial f(z) = z^2 consists precisely of the complement of the closed unit disc: :I(f) = {z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\colon z > 1 }. Transcendental entire functions Escaping set of (exp x ‚àí 1)/2. For transcendental entire functions, the escaping set is much more complicated than for polynomials: in the simplest cases like the one illustrated in the picture it consists of uncountably many curves, called hairs or rays. In other examples the structure of the escaping set can be very different (a spider's web). As mentioned above, there are examples of transcendental entire functions whose escaping set contains no curves. By definition, the escaping set is an FœÉŒ¥ set; that is, a countable intersection of FœÉ sets. It is neither GŒ¥ nor FœÉ.

There are important exhibits recounting the major contribution of Lord Trenchard to the founding and development of the RAF, some of which were originally housed in a small museum in his name at RAF Upavon. The museum also records the background to apprentice training at the Halton camp through examples of the tools, work and test pieces completed by apprentices, and the exploits of some of those who were trained there. The museum has two complete aircraft, many models of aircraft, a number of aero engines, weapons and other equipment on display. There are a large number of photographs, a mock up of barrack rooms, and the uniforms worn by those stationed at Halton Camp over the years.

In 1973, she was awarded the first ever Golden Guitar, for writing \\"Lights on the Hill\\". She was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown in 1983. The 2020 documentary film Slim and I told the story of her life and musical partnership with Dusty. The McKean-Dusty musical partnership produced over 100 albums, sold eight million records in Australia alone, and earned 45 Golden Guitars. Biography=Early life and career Joy McKean was born in Singleton in the Hunter Region, New South Wales on 14 January 1930. As an infant, McKean lived on the dairy farm belonging to her mother's family. Her father was a country school teacher and the family moved around to several regional centres during her youth. Her mother and their father, who was a steel guitar player, encouraged an interest in different types of music, including country performers Jimmie Rogers and the Carter Family. Joy learned the accordion, piano and steel guitar, while younger sister Heather McKean learned the ukulele and both took up yodeling. McKean also contracted polio as a child and was treated in Sydney by the famous Sister Kenny. McKean first performed on the radio for the first time around the age of 10 on Sydney's 2GB radio station. Later McKean and her sister, Heather McKean (born February 20, 1932), sang for the Sydney University Revue, while a student at the university. By the age of 18, in the 1940s, she was performing live with her sister Heather on their own half-hour Saturday radio show on 2KY as the McKean Sisters, noted for their yodelling harmonies.http://www.abc.net.au/rural/nt/content/201001/s2792424.htm The Melody Trail starring the two sisters ran from 1949 until 1956. The McKeans began recording, and from 1951 with Rodeo Label they cut such trademark hits as \\"Gymkhana Yodel\\" and \\"Yodel Down The Valley\\". During this time, Joy McKean first met Slim Dusty, introduced by radio DJ Tim McNamara in Sydney. Marriage and musical partnership with Slim Dusty Joy McKean married Slim Dusty (real name David Kirkpatrick) in 1951 (becoming Mrs Kirkpatrick, but retaining Joy McKean as her stage name). Sister Heather met Reg Lindsay, whom she married in 1954 and the sisters began solo careers and partnerships with two of Australia's leading male country music singers. McKean was Dusty's wife and manager for over 50 years, creating a hugely successful body of work.Slim Dusty documentary is pure joy, in more ways than one; SMH; Sep 10, 2020 Dusty and McKean had two children: Anne Kirkpatrick and David Kirkpatrick who are also accomplished singer-songwriters. The family began annual round Australia tours in 1964 ‚Äì encompassing a 30,000 mile, 10-month journey which was the subject of a feature film, The Slim Dusty Movie in 1984. Dusty attained international success with his 1957 hit \\"A Pub With No Beer\\", and remained at the forefront of Australian country music from that time until his death in 2003. Together they produced more than 100 albums, sold eight million records in Australia alone, and earned 45 Golden Guitars. McKean developed a flair for melody and musical storytelling with vivid evocative imagery. She was awarded the first ever Golden Guitar award in 1973, for writing \\"Lights on the Hill\\", performed by Dusty.http://www.abc.net.au/rural/nt/content/201001/s2792424.htm, Other popular songs written by McKean for her husband include: \\"Walk A Country Mile\\", \\"Indian Pacific\\", \\"Kelly's Offsider\\", \\"The Angel Of Goulburn Hill\\" and \\"The Biggest Disappointment\\".http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 McKean was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1991 for \\"service to the entertainment industry\\".

His reign marks the first attempt by the Siamese to subjugate the island kingdom. As recorded by Wang Dayuan in 1349, a Siamese fleet consisted of 70 junks descended upon the island kingdom. The heavily fortified city managed to withstand the siege of the Siamese until the fleet fleeing with the arrival of Chinese ships; this incident was recorded by a Chinese merchant named Wang Dayuan in his own account, the Daoyi Zhilue. At the same time, the increasingly powerful Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, began eyeing the growing influence of the tiny island kingdom. Under the leadership of its ambitious warlord, Gajah Mada, Majapahit started to embark on overseas expansions against all kingdoms of Nusantara including the remnants of the Srivijaya. In 1350, Hayam Wuruk ascended to the throne of Majapahit. The new king sent an envoy to Singapura demanding the submission of the tiny kingdom. Sri Wikrama Wira refused to do so and even sent a symbolic message threatening to shave the Majapahit king's head should he proceed to Singapura. The furious Majapahit king ordered an invasion with a fleet of 180 main warships and innumerable small vessels. The fleet passed through the islands of Bintan, from where the news spread to Singapura. The defenders immediately assembled 400 warships to face the invasion. Both sides clashed on the coast of Singapura in a battle that took place over three days. The Javanese were largely inexperienced in naval warfare, and were completely overwhelmed and forced to flee.

The film tells three distinct episodic stories using the same actors, Estelle Taylor and Marc McDermott. Long thought to be a lost film like many other Fox Film productions from this period, a copy of this movie is now in the collection of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.Progressive Silent Film List: While New York Sleeps at silentera.com Plot As described in a film magazine, in the first story a suburban wife (Taylor) has married a wealthy man (Locke) in the belief that her first husband (McDermott), a cad, had been killed. While the second husband is away, her first husband appears and demands money for his silence. A struggle ensues after a burglar (Southern) enters the home to rob it, and the burglar shoots the first husband. The wife, hearing her second husband arriving in his car, takes the revolver in her hand as the burglar escapes, telling her second husband that she shot a burglar (the body of her first husband). The second episode is a recital of the badger game with the vamp (Taylor), the man (McDermott), and his friend (Southern), and includes a scene depicting the Frolic at Ziegfeld Follies. The third episode involves a tragedy that takes place in New York's Lower East Side. Cast *Estelle Taylor as A Wife / The Vamp / The Girl *William Locke as Her husband *Marc McDermott as Strange Visitor / The Man / The Paralytic *Harry Southern as Burglar / Friend / His Son *Earl Metcalfe as The Gangster Reception According to author Aubrey Solomon, this film was Fox's biggest moneymaker for the year 1920 with a profit of $192,000. While this would seem to conflict with the enormous success of Fox's Over the Hill to the Poorhouse (1920), the latter film did not achieve its largest rentals until it went into full release in 1921.Solomon, p. 54.

Internet freedom impacts everyone that uses the Internet. People use it to voice their opinions on topics that they are passionate about. This is where digital rights come into play. People should be able to express what they are passionate about on the internet, and it is just as important that we have freedom of information which allows anyone to look up anything they like. If this wasn't here, imagine writing a paper and not having access to the information online that you need. With internet freedom, the government or service providers can't censor information. The Obama administration worked on making Internet freedom a human right. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pushed for this in 2010 tried to put it on the agenda of the United Nations Human Rights Council. However, not everyone thinks this way. Some people believe that Internet freedom is not a human right. They think this because putting something like Internet freedom as a human right could weaken what human rights stand for. Going along with this, people pay for, own, and operate these servers and saying someone has a right to them which makes it a claim of entitlement. Countries such as China and Russia limit what their citizens can watch and view on the Internet. For the past decade Net neutrality has been discussed and whether it should stay the same. \\"In June 2012, it was declared a human right by the United Nations Human Rights Council.\\" Some countries have attempted to ban certain sites and or words that would limit internet freedom. \\"Since the 1990s, European regulators have held American technology firms to higher standards of privacy and competition than American regulators have required them.

In the United States, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech even on the internet. As long as statements are not slanderous, they can be posted to the internet legally. In today's society, more and more fake information is being posted online prompting many people to not believe what they read on the internet. This is troublesome because many people today use the Internet for their daily news and weather, as opposed to television. This change has continued throughout the past decade and will continue to increase. It allows for the increased flow of information and allows information to be obtained faster than ever before. Events such as elections and disasters are known about within seconds rather than hours or days.

Gordon Melton and James R. Lewis, on the Family International. Sex, Slander, and Salvation consists of 17 chapters made up of essays and research papers revolving around the Family International religious movement. The introduction was written by James R. Lewis. Critical reception Robert Balch, critiquing the book in a 1996 issue of Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, wrote that the book suffered from a \\"methodological flaw running throughout the book.\\" According to Balch sources of information were limited exclusively to committed members and Family literature failing to triangulate it with ex-member testimony. Balch also expressed concern about the scholars being subjected to impression management by the Family thus skewing their research data. Balch concluded that it was a book worth having for the information on the Family but also for the \\"serious questions it raises about bias in the way new religions are studied.\\" Richard Singelenberg discussed the book in a review he wrote for the Journal of Contemporary Religion; he wrote favorably on it but identified two flaws he found in the book. One of these was the repeated characterization of law enforcement actions as \\"Gestapo Methods\\", including one time where it said the \\"Nazi jackboots are alive and well.\\" Singelenberg also expressed concern at the paying of \\"scanty attention to the movement's doctrines on Judaism\\" and that there was no excuse for \\"excluding a thorough and detached analysis\\" of the movement's alleged anti-semitic beliefs. Despite these flaws Singelenberg concluded the book was a \\"reliable portrait of a movement in constant flux.\\" Singelenberg lamented the fact that Sex, Slander, and Salvation was published just before David Berg's death and the Love Charter's reorganization of the Family International. Singelenberg emphasized the two events would be sure to have \\"profound effects\\" on the Family. James D. Chancellor, a Christian researcher who undertook his own study of The Family, wrote in Toward Reflexive Ethnography: Participating, Observing, Narrating (2001) that \\"a number of insightful articles\\" in Sex, Slander and Salvation were among \\"the most useful sources\\" he had consulted at the beginning of his own research. Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi in the 2001 book Misunderstanding Cults characterized the work as \\"made-to-order PR efforts (with a few scholarly papers which got in by honest mistakes on the part of both authors and editors)\\" and just one of the \\"extreme examples of the literature of apologetics that has dominated NRM research for years.\\" Media Homes Stephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs would later allege the use of \\"media homes\\" during the course of the researchers' studies for Sex, Slander and Salvation. \\"Media homes\\" were described by Kent and Krebs as follows: \\"Hand-picked individuals living in these well-funded facilities went through rehearsals about how to portray themselves and the group to media, scholars, and others who might scrutinize them.\\" Kent and Krebs also noted question-and-answer pamphlets produced by the group to prevent members from \\"revealing sensitive information about the group.\\" References Category:The Family International Category:Sociology books Category:Religious studies books Category:1994 non-fiction books Category:American essay collections ","title":"Sex, Slander, and Salvation"},{"id":"29115552","text":"Maine School Administrative District 7 (MSAD 7) is an operating school district within Maine, covering the town of North Haven.

Feilberg 1839-1919). In 1864, Feilberg together with August Sachtler took over the photographic studio in Singapore known as Sachtler & Co. Soon afterwards, together with E. Hermann Sachtler, he established a branch office in Penang. In 1867, Feilberg set up his own studio in Penang and, the same year, exhibited 15 views of Penang and Ceylon at the Paris World Exposition. He also produced a 10-part panoramic view of Penang taken from Edinburgh House. The earliest photographs of eastern Sumatra were taken by Feilberg in 1869. Considered to be of excellent quality, they include integrated group portraits of workers on tobacco plantations such as the one at Arendsburg. They are presented in three albums entitled \\"Views\\" at the Royal Tropical Institute.Mattie Boom, \\"Fotografie in de Sumatra-albums van Paul Sandel\\", Bulletin van het Rijks Museum, Jaargang 53, 2005, nummer 3.

In September of that year, he joined an expedition with C. de Haan who had been appointed by the Dutch East Indies government to explore the area in the interior around Lake Toba where he photographed the landscape and the Batak people, including the hierarchical princes. Photographing Lake Toba was an achievement akin to the discovery of Lake Victoria in 1858. Despite numerous obstacles, Feilberg was able to record the geography of the region, a feat highly appreciated by de Haan who spoke of the beauty of the landscape. In the 1880s, he again worked as a photographer in Singapore.Khoo Salma Nasution, \\"More than merchants: a history of the German-speaking community in Penang, 1800s-1940s\\", Areca Books, 2006, page 34. .

He was Professor of Political Economy at University College London, co-founder of what is now Henley Business School and Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford. Biographical sketch As an undergraduate at Brasenose, Noel Hall achieved a first in Modern history and distinction in the Oxford University Certificate in Social Anthropology (1925), after which he was granted a Commonwealth Fund (Harkness) fellowship to study economics at Princeton where he was awarded Artium Magister (1926). He taught at University College London (UCL) from 1927‚Äì38, where he recruited Hugh Gaitskell as an assistant lecturer. Hall was UCL's Professor of Political economy from 1935 to 1938, when he was appointed Director of the newly created National Institute of Economic and Social Research (1938‚Äì43). In World War II he served in a senior position at the Ministry of Economic Warfare and then led the War Trade department at the British embassy in Washington. Noel Hall stayed in the US after the war to make a study of interest rates at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study and on his return to Britain was the founding Principal of the Administrative staff College, Henley.

He co-founded and served as the first chief editor of Musica Britannica, producing scholarly editions of British music hitherto unavailable. He published critical editions of operas by Handel, Purcell and John Blow. After working in the music department of the BBC, Lewis became professor of music at the University of Birmingham (1947‚Äì68) and was principal of the Royal Academy of Music in London (1968‚Äì82). As a conductor Lewis played a role in the baroque music revival of the mid 20th century by directing performances of several Handel opera revivals, and making commercial premiere recordings of works from the 17th and 18th centuries.

Retrieved 18 November 2017 There was a military tradition on both sides of the family, which the young Lewis did not follow: his musical talent became clear from his early years and he was sent to Salisbury Cathedral choir school, and at the age of eight he became a chorister at St George's Chapel, Windsor. At the age of 13 Lewis attended the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), London, studying composition with William Alwyn. He won a scholarship to Wellington College, from where, in 1932, he went to Peterhouse, Cambridge. There, according to The Times, he was \\"one of the most brilliant of his generation to have come under the influence of E.J.Dent\\".\\"Obituary: Sir Anthony Lewis\\", The Times, 7 June 1938, p. 16 A scholarship enabled him to spend some months studying in Paris with Nadia Boulanger in 1934. He graduated the following year as BA and MusB. BBC, wartime and postwar In September 1935 Lewis joined the music staff of the BBC under the corporation's director of music, Adrian Boult. He produced a favourably-received series of programmes, Handel in Rome, and took over the pioneering educational series, The Foundations of Music, for which he sometimes conducted or played the organ as well as producing.\\"The Foundations of Music\\", BBC Genome.

At the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts his choral Overture, consisting of vocalise for an eight-part unaccompanied choir was premiered in 1938. During the Second World War Lewis joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, serving in the Middle East. In addition to his official duties he helped to organise, and conducted, concerts for the troops. After the war, Lewis returned to the BBC in 1946. His brief was to plan and take charge of the music in the new Third Programme. The Times commented, \\"its famously high musical standards were substantially due to Lewis's combination of scholarly curiosity and painstaking efficiency\\". Birmingham and Musica Britannica In 1947, at the age of 32, Lewis joined the faculty of the University of Birmingham as Peyton and Barber Professor of Music, a post he held for 21 years. In The Musical Times his former student and later colleague Nigel Fortune noted that as well as \\"developing an academically fertile department\\", Lewis conducted \\"a wide range of music in professional concerts and with university forces\\", in demanding modern works such as Les noces and Cantata Profana. At Birmingham, Lewis continued his efforts to revive Baroque music. In live performance he set high standards for performances of choral and stage works.Scott, David. \\"Lewis, Sir Anthony\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press.

Lewis was an early proponent of the revival of Handel operas, which for 200 years had been generally regarded as unstageable.Thicknesse, Robert. \\"A Handel on the heart\\", The Times, 3 June 2003, p. 17 During his early years as professor at Birmingham, Lewis approached the Royal Musical Association with a proposal to launch a national edition of British music, making available scholarly editions of otherwise generally unpublished scores. He contended: The proposal was agreed, and resulted in the inception of Musica Britannica in 1951. Lewis was its general editor, assisted by Thurston Dart. In its first 20 years the undertaking produced more than 30 volumes. In 1954 Lewis was appointed chairman of the music advisory panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain, holding the post until 1965. While at Birmingham, Lewis married Lesley Lisle Smith (b. 1924) on 10 September 1959. There were no children. Royal Academy of Music In 1968 Lewis was appointed principal of the RAM on the retirement of Sir Thomas Armstrong. His biographer Michael Pope observes that the balance between academic and artistic work that characterised Lewis's life was now tilted away from pure scholarship: \\"for the next fourteen years he presided over many important developments in an institution where the emphasis was on performance and composition.\\" He was concerned at a perceived split in the musical profession between musicologists and performers, and maintained, \\"each should look to the other for help, for between them they could enable a great advance to be made in the interpretation of music\\".\\"Prof Lewis condemns split in music world\\", The Times, 4 January 1968, p. 6 The Times judged the post to be well suited to Lewis's talents, and one that he filled with distinction.

In 1982 Lewis retired from the RAM. He died at his home in Haslemere the following year, at the age of 68.

(Another saying: he was born in the city of Hankou, but his family moved to Changsha when he was four years old.) He attended the Ningxiang No. 4 High School. After graduating from Peking University in 1954, he was dispatched to the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In 1992, he moved to Boulder, Colorado, United States. Role in Chinese culture On Li's role in Chinese culture, Professor Yu Ying-shih of Princeton University has written, \\"Through (his) books he emancipated a whole generation of young Chinese intellectuals from Communist ideology\\" Li Zehou himself writes that \\"our younger generation longs to make a contribution to the fields of philosophy and that they are searching [for new avenues] to meet the nation's general goal of modernization as well as the challenge to answer the question about what direction the world is heading.\\"From M.E Sharp,Inc., book publishers, \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\", Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000, Pages: 3 ‚Äì 19 Critic of Chinese government response to Tiananmen Square As a result of his criticism of the Chinese government's response to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he was labeled a \\"thought criminal\\" and confined to house arrest for three years. Following substantial U.S. official and academic pressure, the Chinese government granted Professor Li permission to visit the United States in 1991. Subsequently, the U.S. government granted him permanent resident status. Since 1992, Professor Li has held numerous academic positions, including appointments at Colorado College, the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin, Swarthmore College and the University of Colorado Boulder.A biographical introduction from a Source Cultures in the 21st Century:Conflicts &Convergences; A Symposium Celebrating the 125th Anniversary of The Colorado College 4‚Äì6 February 1999 Philosophy of the human being An overriding goal of Li Zehou's work has been to promote a philosophy of the human being that was not only based on the materialistic and historical realities as analyzed and posited by Karl Marx, but which also supported the view of Immanuel Kant as to the individual's intellectual, moral and aesthetic capacities. As a core element in his analysis, he incorporates the thinking of the greats of Chinese philosophy as well. This blended and fundamentally optimistic view of humankind was a counterbalance to the views of humans during and after the Cultural Revolution. Li Zehou's analysis of Marxist philosophy and political theory developed the following philosophical concepts: Practical philosophy of subjectivity The \\"Practical Philosophy of Subjectivity\\" is the study of the human being on two levels, each level with its own internal additional two sub-levels of content: 1) that of humankind, with both a techno-social structure and a \\"cultural-psychological\\" formation; and, 2) that of the individual, at once a member of a society, a social class, an ethnicity, etc., and at the same time a distinct body and mind. These four dimensions interact and are interwoven. With this construct of \\"Subjectivity\\", the most fundamental dimension is the technosocial. \\"Human beings first need to ensure their bodily existence before they can occupy themselves with other matters\\". But the cultural-psychological aspect, ritual, communal and linguistic dimension separates humans from animals.\\"A Supplementary Explanation of Subjectivity\\" (originally published in 1987), M.E Sharp,Inc., from Summaries of Essays published in \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\", Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000, Pages 26‚Äì31,translated by Peter Wong Yih Jiun Motor thinking Motor Thinking is the conscious coordination of using a tool. To elaborate, the use of tools is not an instinctive biological activity, but rather one \\"attained and consolidated through a long period of posteriori learning from experience\\". The Motor Thinking process creates self-consciousness arising from the attention paid to tool making. Transmission of tool based activities to others, using primitive language, results in semantic thinking: \\"The forms of motor thinking gradually made way for the forms of language-led thought\\". Coupled with primitive language, motor thinking ultimately results in the creation of a \\"vague, common consciousness of being a community\\". which develops into the \\"symbolic tools of shamanic rites and ceremonies resulting in the establishment of primitive human society‚Ä¶ fundamentally different from that of the animals\\".An Outline of the Origin of Humankind (Originally published in 1985), M.E Sharp,Inc., Summaries of Essays published in \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\", Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000 Pages 20 -26 translated by Peter Wong Yih Jiun. Chinese aesthetics and the relation to freedom Li identifies four features that sum up his views on Chinese aesthetics. The concept of Music/Joy (‰πê: Yue/Le) holds a central place in Chinese culture, \\"Music is joy\\". Music has a civilizing effect and \\"prevents human emotions from developing in an animal-like fashion\\". Music causes \\"people to be on good terms with each other, promoting harmony in society\\". Music is linear, flows in time, and expresses emotion. From this linearity derives the second feature of Chinese aesthetics ‚Äì the importance of the line in Chinese art. Li recalls that Immanuel Kant also felt was the superior aesthetic visual format. (Chinese art also emphasizes the expression of emotion and pays particular attention to rhythm, rhyme and flavor.) He then goes on to describe the third element which is the blending of feeling and reason: \\"imaginative reality is more significant than sensible reality.\\" Finally, he lists the \\"union of heaven and humankind\\" and describes it as the \\"fundamental spirit of Chinese philosophy...the relation between human and human, and between humankind and nature.\\" He then proclaims that \\"to roam with the arts\\" is essential to the attainment of freedom. Freedom is neither heaven-sent nor given at birth as Rousseau suggested. Freedom is established by humankind ... \\" For Li, aesthetics are important!\\"A few Questions Concerning the History of Chinese Aesthetics\\" (originally published in 1985), M.E Sharp,Inc., Summaries of Essays published in \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\" Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000, pages 66‚Äì78 translated by Peter Wong Yih Jiun. Impact on conventional Chinese thought Li also wrote critiques of contemporary Chinese thought in the second half of the 1980‚Äôs. Li Zehou‚Äôs 1987 essay \\"The Western is the Substance, and the Chinese is for Application\\", turned conventional contemporary Chinese thought on its head. Li stated that Western Learning encompasses technology as well as conceptual systems and philosophies including Marxism and is the pluralistic and diverse technosocial basis of modern-day China's reality. Li Zehou concluded that the Chinese application should adapt Western Learning with Chinese traditions, influencing but not dictating the results. To paraphrase, the goal of this examination synthesis should preserve in ethics the strength and splendor of giving precedence to others before oneself; should preserve the value of intuition within the process of reasoning, and should preserve the rich Chinese culture with regard to the handling of inter-human relationships.\\"The Western is the Substance and the Chinese is for Application\\" (Originally published in 1987), M.E Sharp,Inc., Summaries of Essays published in \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\" Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000 Pages 32‚Äì39, In \\"Dual Variation of Enlightenment and Nationalism\\", Li Zehou argues that all modern concepts such as freedom, independence human rights, which were discarded after 1919, and all Chinese traditions should be analyzed and investigated. He wrote that following a relatively long period of peace, developing prosperity and modernization, China would benefit from an examination of the West's \\"centuries of experience in political-legal theory and practice such as the separations of the three powers\\". He foresaw that the concept of freedom limited by law would protect the weak and prevent Party officials standing above the law.\\"Dual Variation of Enlightenment and Nationalism\\" (Originally published in 1987), M.E Sharp,Inc., Summaries of Essays published in \\"Contemporary Chinese Thought\\" Volume 31, Number 2 / Winter 1999‚Äì2000 Pages 40 to 43 Selected works *History of Chinese Aesthetics (), with Liu Gangji, China Social Sciences Press, 1984 (volume 1) and 1987 (volume 2) *The Path of Beauty: A Study of Chinese Aesthetics, Oxford University Press, 1988 *Four Essays on Aesthetics: Toward a Global Perspective, with Jane Cauvel, Lexington Books, 2006 *The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition, with Maija Bell Samei, University of Hawai'i Press, 2010 ReferencesExternal links *\\"Modernization and the Confucian World\\", Colorado College's 125th Anniversary Symposium on Cultures in the 21st Century: Conflicts and Convergences, address given February 5, 1999 *\\"Li Zehou And The Marxist Reconstruction Of Confucianism\\", High Culture Fever, UC Press Ebooks *Interview with Li (in Chinese), Shanghai Review of Books, October 2010 Category:1930 births Category:People's Republic of China historians Category:Chinese expatriates in the United States Category:People from Ningxiang Category:Living people Category:Writers from Changsha Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:Hunan First Normal University alumni Category:Peking University alumni Category:Historians from Hunan Category:Educators from Hunan Category:Philosophers of art Category:Philosophers from Hunan ","title":"Li Zehou"},{"id":"29115790","text":"Lawrence John Cannon (November 18, 1852 - January 30, 1921) was a Canadian lawyer and judge.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Although the church is not open for regular worship, it still hosts occasional special services, such as Pentecost and Christmas services for the Living Brook BeneficeLiving Brook Benefice . History The church originated in the 12th century, its tower, nave walls, and the west wall of the chancel remaining from that time. The chancel was extended in the 13th century, and at the same time a parapet and new windows were added to the tower. After the Reformation, the church became unused. In the 16th century it became a ruin, the bells and lead were sold, and it was partly demolished. During this time the chancel was used as a dog kennel, and the tower as a pigeon house. The church was extensively repaired in about 1622, the south door and windows in the nave and chancel date from this period. Further repairs and alterations to the chancel were undertaken in 1808, and again in 1854, the latter by E. F. Law. There were more restorations in 1901 and 1976. The church was declared redundant on 1 March 1972, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 12 April 1976. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in coursed limestone rubble, the dressings are in ironstone and the roof is slate. Its plan consists of a nave, chancel and west tower. The nave measures by , the chancel by , and the tower is internally square. The tower is about high and is in three stages. In the centre of each side is a pilaster buttress. On the north side in the bottom stage is a blocked round-arched doorway, and an external piscina. The middle stage has small round-headed windows. In the upper stage there are two single- light bell openings on the east face, and a two-light bell opening on each of the other sides. The parapet is battlemented. The east window has three lights and contains Perpendicular style tracery inserted in the 19th century. Over the window is a date stone inscribed with the date 1808, and flanking it are buttresses. In the north wall of the chancel is a blocked doorway with a Tudor arch, and a two-light mullioned window at a high level. In the south wall is a three-light window, two blocked windows, and a blocked priest's doorway with a round arch. In the nave is a four-light window on the north side, and in the south wall a Tudor-arched door flanked by two-light windows. Interior The chancel arch is Norman in style. It is completely rendered, other than the string courses between the tops of the piers and the bases of the arches. When the rendering was removed from the string courses by the Upper Nene Archaeological Society, it was discovered that they were decorated with carvings. The carvings include sawtooth patterns, lozenge motifs, and depictions of a snake and birds. It has been suggested that they are in Viking style, and were possibly re-used from a former churchyard cross. However this has been refuted by Kathryn Morrison who expresses the opinion that the carvings date from the late 11th or early 12th century, and that an earlier date is \\"impossible\\". She also states that \\"the suggestion that the carvings are from a churchyard cross is difficult to substantiate\\". Elsewhere in the church, the chancel contains a sedilia, a piscina and an aumbry. The font is inserted into the north pier of the tower arch, and consists of a bowl on a polygonal stem. Also in the church are two hatchments, and memorials. There is one bell, cast by Henry Penn of Peterborough in 1710. The church plate includes a cup and paten dated 1860.

Some of these include Mudharabah (profit sharing), Wadiah (safekeeping), Musharakah (joint venture), Murabahah (cost plus finance), Ijar (leasing), Hawala (an international fund transfer system), Takaful (Islamic insurance), and Sukuk (Islamic bonds). Sharia prohibits riba, or usury, defined as interest paid on all loans of money (although some Muslims dispute whether there is a consensus that interest is equivalent to riba).Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: pp. 3‚Äì6Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: pp. 216‚Äì226 Investment in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles (e.g. pork or alcohol) is also haraam (\\"sinful and prohibited\\"). By 2014 around $2 trillion in financial assets, or 1 percent of total world, was sharia-compliant, concentrated in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Iran, and Malaysia. Principles To be consistent with the principles of Islamic law (Shariah) and guided by Islamic economics, the contemporary movement of Islamic banking and finance prohibits a variety of activities: * Paying or charging interest. \\"All forms of interest are riba and hence prohibited\\".Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: pp. xv‚Äìxvi Islamic rules on transactions (known as Fiqh al-Muamalat) have been created to prevent use of interest. * Investing in businesses involved in activities that are forbidden (haraam). These include things such as selling alcohol or pork, or producing media such as gossip columns or pornography.The Islamic Banking and Finance Database provides more information on the subject. * Charging extra for late payment. This applies to mur√¢ba·∏•ah or other fixed payment financing transactions, although some authors believe late fees may be charged if they are donated to charity, or if the buyer has \\"deliberately refused\\" to make a payment. * Maisir. This is usually translated as \\"gambling\\" but used to mean \\"speculation\\" in Islamic finance. Involvement in contracts where the ownership of a good depends on the occurrence of a predetermined, uncertain event in the future is maisir and forbidden in Islamic finance. * Gharar. Gharar is usually translated as \\"uncertainty\\" or \\"ambiguity\\". Bans on both maisir and gharar tend to rule out derivatives, options and futures. Islamic finance supporters (such as Mervyn K. Lewis and Latifa M. Algaoud) believe these involve excessive risk and may foster uncertainty and fraudulent behaviour such as are found in derivative instruments used by conventional banking.Mervyn K. Lewis, Latifa M. Algaoud: Islamic Banking, Cheltenham, 2001 * Engaging in transactions lacking \\"\`material finality\`. All transactions must be \\"directly linked to a real underlying economic transaction\\", which generally excludes \\"options and most other derivatives\\". Money earned from the most common type of Islamic financing‚Äîdebt-based contracts‚Äî\\"must\\" come \\"from a tangible asset that one owns and thus has the right to sell‚Äîand in financial transactions it demands that risk be shared.\\" Money cannot be made from money. as \\"it is only a medium of exchange.\\"Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 12Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 275 Risk and return on distribution to participants should be symmetrical so that no one benefits disproportionately from the transaction.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 89Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 86 Other restrictions include * A board of shariah experts is to supervise and advise each Islamic bank on the propriety of transactions to \\"ensure that all activities are in line with Islamic principles\\".Lewis, M.

Mahmud el-Gamal found interpretations most strict in Sudan and least in Malaysia.) Islamic banking and finance has been described as having the \\"same purpose\\" (Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance), or having the same \\"basic objective\\" (Mohamed Warsame), as conventional banking but operating in accordance with the rules of shariah law. Benefits that will follow from banning interest and obeying \\"divine injunctions\\"Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 11 include an Islamic economy free of \\"imbalances\\" (Taqi Usmani)‚Äîconcentration of \\"wealth in the hands of the few\\", or monopolies which paralyze or hinder market forces, etc.‚Äîa \\"move towards economic development, creation of the value added factor, increased exports, less imports, job creation, rehabilitation of the incapacitated and training of capable elements\\" (Saleh Abdullah Kamel). Other describe these benefits (or similar ones) as \\"principals\\" or \\"objectives\\" of Islamic finance. Nizam Yaquby, for example declares that the \\"guiding principles\\" for Islamic finance include: \\"fairness, justice, equality, transparency, and the pursuit of social harmony\\".Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 53 Some distinguish between sharia-compliant finance and a more holistic, pure and exacting sharia-based finance.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 236 \\"Ethical finance\\" has been called necessary, or at least desirable,Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 198 for Islamic finance, as has a \\"gold-based currency\\".Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 192 Zubair Hasan argues that the objectives of Islamic finance as envisaged by its pioneers were \\"promotion of growth with equity ... the alleviation of poverty ... [and] a long run vision to improve the condition of the Muslim communities across the world.\\" ;Criticism Modernist/Minimalist critic Feisal Khan argues that in many ways Islamic finance has not lived up to its defining characteristics. Risk-sharing is lacking because profit and loss sharing modes are so infrequently used. Underlying material transactions are also missing in such transactions as \\"tawarruq, commodity murabahas, Malaysian Islamic private debt securities, and Islamic short-sales\\". Exploitation is involved when high fees are charged for \\"doing nothing more substantial than mimicking conventional banking /finance products\\". Haram activities are not avoided when banks (following the customary practice) simply take the word of clients/financees/borrowers that they will not use funds for unIslamic activities.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 112 Others (such as convert Umar Ibrahim Vadillo) agree that the Islamic banking movement has failed to follow the principles of shariah law, but call for greater strictness and greater separation from the non-Muslim world. Overview of products, contracts, etc. Banking makes up most of the Islamic finance industry. Banking products are often classified in one of three broad categories,Hussain, M., A. Shahmoradi, and R. Turk. 2014. \\"Overview of Islamic Finance,\\" IMF Working Paper (forthcoming), International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC. two of which are \\"investment accounts\\":Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: pp. 329‚Äì330 * Profit and loss sharing modes‚Äîmusharakah and mudarabah‚Äîwhere financier and the user of finance share profits and losses, are based on \\"contracts of partnership\\".Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 96 * \\"Asset-backed financing\\", (also known as trade-based financing\\" or \\"non-PLS financing\\"),Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 90 \\"debt-like instruments\\" which are based on \\"debt-based contracts\\" or \\"contracts of exchange\\". They are structured as sales and allow for \\"the transfer of a commodity for another commodity, the transfer of a commodity for money, or the transfer of money for money\\". They involve the financing \\"purchase and hire of goods or assets and services\\", and like conventional loans repayment is deferred, increased, and made on a \\"fixed- return basis\\". Unlike conventional loans, the fixed return is called \\"profit\\" or \\"markup\\", not \\"interest\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 87 According to Feisal Khan, \\"virtually every\\" Islamic banking advocate argues that these \\"non-non-participatory\\" forms of finance are acceptable only as \\"an interim measure\\" as Islamic banking develops, or for situations such as small and personal loans where participatory financing is not practical. Faleel Jamaldeen states that debt-based contracts are often used to finance not-so- minor purchases (homes, cars, etc.) for bank customers.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 153 These instruments include mark-up (murabaha), leasing (ijara), cash advances for the purchase of agricultural produce (salam), and cash advances for the manufacture of assets (istisna'). the third category consists of * Modes based on contracts of safety and security, include safe-keeping contracts (wadi‚Äôah) for current deposits (called checking accounts in the US), and agency contracts (wakalah). Current account deposits are regarded as trusts or safe-keeping and offer the depositors safety of their money against the bank's guarantee to return their funds on demand. (A current account the customer earns no return, but sources do not agree over whether the bank is allowed to invest the account funds.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 330 According to one report, in practice no examples of 100 percent reserve banking are known to exist.) ;Non-banking finance Islamic non-banking finance has grown to encompass a wide range of services, but as of 2013, banking still dominates and represented about four-fifths of total assets in Islamic finance.Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB). 2014. Islamic Financial Services Industry Stability Report. Kuala Lumpur: IFSB. The sukuk market is also a fast-growing segment with assets equivalent to about 15 percent of the industry. Other services include leasing, equity markets, investment funds, insurance (takaful), and microfinance. These products‚Äîand Islamic finance in general‚Äîare based on Islamic commercial contracts (aqad i.e. a commitment between two parties) and contract law,Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 89 with products generally named after contracts (e.g. mudaraba) though they may be combinations of more than one type of contract. Profit and loss sharing While the original Islamic banking proponents hoped profit-loss sharing (PLS) would be the primary mode of finance replacing interest-based loans, long-term financing with profit-and-loss-sharing mechanisms is \\"far riskier and costlier\\" than the long term or medium-term lending of the conventional banks, according to critics such as economist Tarik M. Yousef. Yousef and other observers note that musharakah and mudarabah financing have \\"declined to almost negligible proportions\\".Iqbal, Munawar, and Philip Molyneux. 2005.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press In many Islamic banks asset portfolios, short term financing, notably murabaha and other debt-based contracts account for the great bulk of their investments. Mudarabah A \\"mudarabah\\" (profit sharing) contract is a kind of partnership where one partner (rabb-ul-mal) gives money to another (mudarib) for investing in a commercial enterprise. The \\"sleeping\\" rabb-ul-mal party provides 100 percent of the capital. The mudarib party provides its expertise and management.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 91 Profits generated are shared between the parties according to a pre-agreed ratio‚Äîusually either 50%-50%, or 60% for the mudariband 40% for rabb-ul-mal. If there is a loss, the first partner \\"rabb-ul-mal\\" will lose his capital, and the other party \\"mudarib\\" will lose the time and effort invested in the project. The structure of mudaraba is very similar to that of venture capital where the venture capitalist finances the entrepreneur who provides management and labor, so that both profit and risk are shared. Such participatory arrangements between capital on one hand and labor and management on the other, reflect the view of Islamic banking proponents that under Islam the user of capital would not bear all the risk/cost of a failure. And that this would result in a balanced distribution of income and prevent financiers from dominating the economy.Musharakah & Mudarabah By Mufti Taqi Usmani  Limited Liability central-mosque.comUsmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: pp. 17‚Äì36  Musharakah (joint venture)  Musharakah is a relationship between two or more parties that contribute capital to a business and divide the net profit and loss pro rata. Unlike mudarabah, there may be more than two partners and all the providers of capital are entitled (but not required) to participate in management. Like mudarabah, the profit is distributed among the partners in pre-agreed ratios, while the loss is borne by each partner in proportion to respective capital contributions.THE DECLINING BALANCE CO- OWNERSHIP PROGRAM. AN OVERVIEW Guidance Residential, LLC  2012 This mode is often used in investment projects, letters of credit, and the purchase or real estate or property. Musharakah may be \\"permanent\\" (often used in business partnerships) or \\"diminishing\\" (often used in financing major purchases, see below). In Musharaka business transactions, Islamic banks may lend their money to companies by issuing \\"floating rate interest\\" loans, where the floating rate is pegged to the company's individual rate of return, so that the bank's profit on the loan is equal to a certain percentage of the company's profits. Use of musharaka (or at least permanent musharakah) is not great. In Malaysia, for example, the share of musharaka financing declined from 1.4 percent in 2000 to 0.2 percent in 2006Asutay, Mehmet. 2007. Conceptualization of the second best solution in overcoming the social failure of Islamic banking and finance: Examining the overpowering of the homoislamicus by homoeconomicus. IIUM Journal of Economics and Management 15 (2) 173Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: pp. 322‚Äì23 Diminishing Musharaka A popular type of financing for major purchases‚Äîparticularly housing‚Äîis Musharaka al- Mutanaqisa (literally \\"diminishing partnership\\"). A musharaka al-mutanaqisa agreement actually also involves two other Islamic contracts besides partnership‚Äîijarah (leasing by the bank of its share of the asset to the customer) and bay‚Äô (gradual sales of the bank's share to the customer). In this mode of finance the bank and the purchaser/customer start with joint ownership of the purchased asset‚Äîthe customer's sharing being their down- payment, the banks share usually being much larger. The customer leases/rents the asset from the bank‚Äîbank assessing (at least in theory) an imputed rent for use of the asset‚Äîwhile gradually paying off the cost of the asset while the bank's share diminishes to nothing. If default occurs, both the bank and the borrower receive a proportion of the proceeds from the sale of the property based on each party's current equity. This method allows for floating rates according to the current market rate such as the BLR (base lending rate), especially in a dual-banking system like in Malaysia. However, at least one critic (M. A. El-Gamal) complains that this violates the sharia principle that banks must charge \`rent\` (or lease payment) based on comparable rents for the asset being paid off, not \\"benchmarked to commercial interest rate[s]\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 103  Asset-backed financing  Asset-backed or debt-type instruments (also called contracts of exchange) are sales contracts that allow for the transfer of a commodity for another commodity, the transfer of a commodity for money, or the transfer of money for money. They include Murabaha, Musawamah, Salam, Istisna‚Äôa, and Tawarruq.  Mur√¢ba·∏•ah  Murabaha is an Islamic contract for a sale where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or \\"cost-plus\\" priceTurk, Main Types and Risks, 2014: p. 31 for the item(s) being sold. In Islamic banking it has become a term for financing where the bank buys some good (home, car, business supplies, etc.) at the request of a customer and marks up the price of that good for resale to the customer (with the difference clearly stated to the customer) in exchange for allowing the customer/buyer to defer payment. (A contract with deferred payment is known as bai-muajjal in Islamic jurisprudence.) Murabaha has also come to be \\"the most prevalent\\" or \\"default\\" type of Islamic finance. Most of the financing operations of Islamic banks and financial institutions use murabahah, according to Islamic finance scholar Taqi Uthmani,Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 65 (One estimate is that 80% of Islamic lending is by Murabahah.) This is despite the fact that (according to Uthmani) \\"Shari‚Äòah supervisory Boards are unanimous on the point that [Murabahah loans] are not ideal modes of financing\\", and should be used when more preferable means of finance‚Äî\\"musharakah, mudarabah, salam or istisna‚Äò‚Äîare not workable for some reasons\\". Murabahah is somewhat similar to a conventional mortgage transaction (for homes) or hire purchase/\\"installment plan\\" arrangements (for furniture or appliances), in that instead of lending a buyer money to purchase an item and having the buyer pay the lender back, the financier buys the item itself and re-sells it to the customer who pays the financier in installments. Unlike conventional financing, the bank is compensated for the time value of its money in the form of \\"profit\\" not interest, and any penalties for late payment go to charity, not to the financier. Economists have questioned whether Murabahah is \\"economically indistinguishable from traditional, debt- and interest-based finance.\\" Since \\"there is principal and a payment plan, there is an implied interest rate\\", based on conventional banking interest rates such as LIBOR. Others complain that in practice most \\"muraba·∏•ah\\" transactions are merely cash-flows between banks, brokers and borrowers, with no actual buying or selling of commodities. ;Bai' muajjal, also called bai'-bithaman ajil, or BBA, (also known as credit sale or deferred payment sale) In Bai' muajjal (literally \\"credit sale\\", i.e. the sale of goods on a deferred payment basis), the financier buys the equipment or goods requested by the client, then sells the goods to the client for an agreed price, which includes a mark-up (profit) for the bank and is paid either in installments over a pre-agreed period or in a lump sum at a future date. The contract must expressly mention cost of the commodity and the margin of profit is mutually agreed. Bia'muajjal was introduced in 1983 by Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad. Because in Islamic finance the markup in murabahah is charged in exchange for deferred payment, bai' muajjal and murabahah are often used interchangeably, (according to Hans Visser),Visser, Islamic Finance, 2013: p. 66 or \\"in practice ... used together\\" (according to Faleel Jamaldeen).Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p.160 However, according to another (Bangladeshi) source, Bai' muajjal differs from Murabahah in that the client, not the bank, is in possession of and bear the risk for the goods being purchased before completion of payment. And according to a Malaysian source, the main difference between BBA (short for bai'-bithaman ajil) and murabaha‚Äîat least as practiced in Malaysia‚Äîis that murabaha is used for medium and short term financing and BBA for longer term. ;Bai' al 'inah (sale and buy-back agreement) The Faisal Islamic Bank in Khartoum. Bai' al inah (literally, \\"a loan in the form of a sale\\"), is a financing arrangement where the financier buys some asset from the customer on spot basis, with the price paid by the financier constituting the \\"loan\\". Subsequently, the asset is sold back to the customer who pays in installments over time, essentially \\"paying back the loan\\". Since loaning of cash for profit is forbidden in Islamic Finance, there are differences of opinion amongst the scholars on the permissibility of Bai' al 'inah. According to the Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance, it \\"serves as a ruse for lending on interest\\", but Bai' al inah is practised in Malaysia and similar jurisdictions.The emergence of Islamic financing based on the Syariah concept of Tawarruq AZMI and Associates 2008 Bai al inah is not accepted in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) but in 2009 the Malaysian Court of Appeals upheld it as a shariah-compliant technique. This was a demonstration of \\"the philosophical differences\\" in Shariah between these \\"two centers of Islamic finance\\", according to Thomson Reuters Practical Law.  Musawamah  A Musawamah (literally \\"bargaining\\") contract is used if the exact cost of the item(s) sold to the bank/financier either cannot be or is not ascertained. Musawamah differs from Murabahah in that the \\"seller is not under the obligation to reveal his cost or purchase price\\",Visser, Islamic Finance, 2013: p. 67 even if they do know it. Musawamah is the \\"most common\\" type of \\"trading negotiation\\" seen in Islamic commerce.  Istisna  Istisna (also Bia Istisna or Bai' Al-Istisna) and Bia-Salam are \\"forward contracts\\" (customized contracts between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date). They are also contracts made before the objects of sale comes into existence,Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 136 and should be as detailed as possible to avoid uncertainty.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 159Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 162 Istisna (literally, a request to manufacture something) is a \\"forward contract on a project\\" and unlike Bia- Salam can only be a contract for something manufactured, processed, or constructed, which would never exist were it not for the contract to make it. Also unlike bia salam, # The price need not be paid in full in advance. Financing payments may be made in stages to purchase raw materials for manufacturing, construction materials for construction of a building. When the product/structure is finished and sold, the bank can be repaid. # The contract may be canceled unilaterally before the manufacturer or builder starts work. # It is not necessary that the time of delivery be fixed. Examples of istisna in the Islamic finance world include: * projects and residential properties financed by the Kuwait Finance House under construction as of 2012.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 158 * the Barzan project, the \\"biggest financing operation in the energy sector carried out by Qatar Petroleum\\" uses Istisna and Ijara and as of 2013, had US$500M \\"earmarked\\" for it. Bai Salam Like istisna, Bai Salam (also Bai us salam or just salam) is a forward contract in which advance payment is made for goods in the future, with the contract spelling out the nature, price, quantity, quality, and date and place of delivery of the good in precise enough detail \\"to dismiss any possible conflict\\".Turk, Main Types and Risks, 2014: p. 64Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 128 Salam contracts predate istisnaEl-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 81 and were designed to fulfill the needs of small farmers and traders.Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 133Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 161 The objects of the sale maybe of any type‚Äîexcept gold, silver, or currencies based on these metals. Islamic banks often use \\"parallel\\" salam contracts and acting as a middleman. One contract is made with a seller and another with a purchaser to sell the good for a higher price. Examples of banks using these contracts are ADCB Islamic Banking and Dubai Islamic Bank. ;Basic features and conditions of a proper salam contract # A salam transaction must have the buyer paying the purchase price to the seller (the small farmer or trader, etc. being financed) in full at the time of sale. # Salam cannot specify that a particular commodity or a product come from a particular place‚Äîwheat from a particular field, or fruit from a particular tree as this would introduce excessive uncertainty (gharar) to the contract. (The specified crop or fruit might be ruined or destroyed before delivery.)Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 130 # To avoid dispute, the quality and quantity (whether weight or volume) of the commodity purchased must be fully specified leaving no ambiguity. # The exact date and place of delivery must be specified. # Any exchange of gold, silver, wheat, barley, date, or salt on a deferred basis in salam is a violation of riba al-fadl and forbidden. # Salam is a preferred financing structure and carries higher order of shariah compliance than contracts such as Murahabah or Musawamah.  Ijarah  Ijarah, (literally \\"to give something on rent\\") is a term of Islamic jurisprudence,Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 109 and a product in Islamic banking and finance resembling rent-to-own. In traditional fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), it means a contract for the hiring of persons or services or \\"usufruct\\" of a property generally for a fixed period and price. In Islamic finance, al Ijarah usually refers to a leasing contract of property (such as plant, office automation, motor vehicle), which is leased to a client for stream of rental and purchase payments, ends with a transfer of ownership to the lessee, and otherwise follows Islamic regulations. Unlike a conventional lease, the financing party of a sharia-compliant Ijara must buy the asset customer wants to lease and take on \\"some of the commercial risks (such as damage to or loss of the asset) more usually associated with operating leases\\". There are several types of ijarah: ;Ijarah thumma al bai' (hire purchase) Ijarah thumma al bai\` (literally \\"renting/hiring/leasing followed by sale\\") involves the customer renting/hiring/leasing a good and agreeing to purchase it, paying both the lease/rental fee and the purchase price in installments so that by the end of the lease it owns the good free and clear. This involves two Islamic contracts (very much like \\"Diminishing Musharaka\\" above): # an Ijarah that outlines the terms for leasing or renting over a fixed period; # a Bai that outlines the terms for a sale to be completed by the end of the term of the Ijarah. It is very important from the standpoint of shariah law for the Ijarah and Bai not to be combined, but to be two separate contracts. An example would be in an automobile financing facility, a customer enters into the first contract and leases the car from the owner (bank) at an agreed amount over a specific period. When the lease period expires, the second contract comes into effect, which enables the customer to purchase the car at an agreed price. (This type of transaction is similar to the contractum trinius, a legal maneuver used by European bankers and merchants during the Middle Ages to sidestep the Church's prohibition on interest bearing loans. In a contractum, two parties would enter into three (trinius) concurrent and interrelated legal contracts, the net effect being the paying of a fee for the use of money for the term of the loan. The use of concurrent interrelated contracts is also prohibited under Shariah Law.) ;Ijarah wa-iqtina Ijarah wa- iqtina (literally, \\"lease and ownership\\" also called al ijarah muntahia bitamleek) also involves a ijarah followed by sale of leased asset to the lessee, but in an ijara wa iqtina contract the transfer of ownership occurs as soon as the lessee pays the purchase price of the asset‚Äîanytime during the leasing period. An Islamically correct ijara wa iqtina contract \\"rests\\" on three conditions: # The lease and the transfer of ownership of the asset or the property should be recorded in separate documents. # The agreement to transfer of ownership should not be a pre-condition to the signing of the leasing contract. # The \\"promise\\" to transfer the ownership should be unilateral and should be binding only on the lessor. ;ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma In a \\"forward ijarah\\" or ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma Islamic contract (literally \\"lease described with responsibility\\", also transliterated ijara mawsufa bi al thimma), the service or benefit being leased is well-defined, but the particular unit providing that service or benefit is not identified. Thus, if a unit providing the service or benefit is destroyed, the contract is not void. In contemporary Islamic finance, ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma is the leasing of something (such as a home, office, or factory) not yet produced or constructed. This means the ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma contract is combined with a Istisna contract for construction of whatever it is that will provide the service or benefit.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 158 The financier finances its making, while the party begins leasing the asset after \\"taking delivery\\" of it. While forward sales normally do not comply with sharia, it is allowed using ijarah provided rent/lease payment do not begin until after the customer takes delivery. Also required by sharia is that the asset be clearly specified, its rental rate be clearly set (although the rate may float based on the agreement of both parties). ;Ijarah challenges Among the complaints made against ijara are that in the practice some rules are overlooked, such as ones making the lessor/financier liable in the event the property rented is destroyed because of unforeseeable circumstance (Taqi Usmani);Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p. 167 that ijara provides weaker legal standing and consumer protection for foreclosure than conventional mortgage (Abu Umar Faruq Ahmad); and less flexibility for customers who wanting to sell property (such as a car) and repay the loan before its completion (not allowed as the customer does not own the property) (Muhammad Akram Khan).Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 349 Tawarruq Both a Reverse Murabaha (aka Tawarruq) and conventional loan provide a customer with cash in return for deterred repayment, but while a conventional loan is simpler and involves fewer fees, a tawarruq does not violate sharia law (according to some jurists). A Tawarruq (literally \\"turns into silver\\", or \\"monetization\\")El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 34 contract/product is one where a client customer can raise immediate cash to be paid back later by buying an asset that is easily saleable, paying a marked up price with deferred payment and then quickly selling the asset to raise cash. An example of this would be a customer wishing to borrow $900 in cash having their bank buy $1000 worth of some commodity (such as iron) from a supplier, and then buying the iron from the bank with an agreement that they will be given 12 months to pay the $1000 back. The customer then immediately sells the metal back to the bank for $900 cash to be paid on the spot, and the bank then resells the iron. (This would be the equivalent of borrowing $900 for a year at an interest rate of 11 percent.) While tawarruq strongly resembles a cash loan‚Äîsomething forbidden under orthodox Islamic law‚Äîand its greater complexity (like bai' al inah mentioned above) mean higher costs than a conventional bank loan, proponents argue the tangible assets that underlie the transactions give it sharia compliance. However, the contract is controversial with some (also like bai' al inah). Because the buying and selling of the commodities in Tawarruq served no functional purpose, banks/financiers are strongly tempted to forgo it. Islamic scholars have noticed that while there have been \\"billions of dollars of commodity-based tawarruq transactions\\" there have not been a matching value of commodity being traded. In December 2003, the Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League forbade tawarruq \\"as practiced by Islamic banks today\\".El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 72 In 2009 another prominent juristic council, the Fiqh Academy of the OIC, ruled that \\"organized Tawarruq\\" is impermissible. Noted clerics who have ruled against it include Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya and Ibn Taymiyya. On the other hand, Faleel Jamaldeen notes that Islamic banks using Tawarruq as of 2012 include the United Arab Bank, QNB Al Islamic, Standard Chartered of United Arab Emirates, and Bank Muamalat Malaysia.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 156 Charitable lending Taqi Usmani insists that \\"role of loans\\" (as opposed to investment or finance) in a truly Islamic society is \\"very limited\\", and that Shariah law permits loans not as an ordinary occurrence\\", but only in cases of dire need\\".Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 159 ;Qardh-ul Hasan A shariah-compliant loan is known as Qardh-ul Hasan, (also Qard Hasan, literally: \\"benevolent loan\\" or \\"beneficence loan\\"). It is often described as an interest-free loan extended to needy people.Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 196 Such loans are often made by private parties, social service agencies, or by a firm as a benefit to employees, rather than Islamic banks. Quoting hadith, some sources insist that in addition to not \\"charg[ing] interest or any premium above the actual loan amount\\", the lender may also not gain \\"any advantage or benefits\\" from the loan, even \\"riding the borrower‚Äôs mule, eating at his table, or even taking advantage of the shade of his wall‚Äô\\".Takaful.com. \\"Origins and Operations of Takaful System\\", Retrieved 15 December 2007 from http://www.takaful.com.sa/m1sub2.asp . This view is based on fatwa of the Shariah Advisory Board of al-Rajhi Bank, dated April 2001; cited in However, other sources state that the borrower is allowed pay an extra if the extra is optional and not stipulated by contract. Some financial institutions offer products called qardh-ul hasan to lenders which charge no interest but do charge an additional management fee. There are also savings account products called qardh-ul hasan, (the \\"loan\\" being a deposit to a bank account) where the debtor (the bank) may pay an extra amount beyond the principal amount of the loan (known as a hibah, literally gift) as a token of appreciation to the creditor (depositor). These also do not (in theory) violate orthodox sharia if the extra was not promised or pre-arranged with the account/loan agreement. Contracts of safety, security, service These contracts are intended to help individual and business customers keep their funds safe. Hawala Hawala (also Hiwala, Hewala, or Hundi; literally transfer or sometimes trust) is a widely used, informal \\"value transfer system\\" for transferring funds from one geographical area to another, based not on movement of cash, or on telegraph or computer network wire transfers between banks, but on a huge network of money brokers (known as \\"Hawaladars\\") located throughout the Muslim world. According to the IMF, a hawala transaction typically transfers the value of money (or debt) but not corresponding cash, from one country to another. Unlike other Islamic financial products, hawala was not started as an alternative to conventional banking transfers since electronic wire transfers have not been found in violation of sharia, and Islamic banks also use electronic wire transfer. However, hawala has the advantage of being available in places wire transfer is not and of being able to avoid trade-related levies on the recipient such as customs duties and consumption taxes. The hawala network operates outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial channels, and remittance systems, but predates it by many centuries. In the first half of the 20th century it was gradually replaced by the instruments of the conventional banking system, but became a \\"substitute for many banking products\\", as Muslim workers began to migrate to wealthier countries to seek employment in the late 20th century, and sought ways to send money to or secure a loan taken out by their family back home. Dubai has traditionally served as a hub. Hawala example transaction; see text for an explanation Each hawala transaction takes place entirely on the honour system, and since the system does not depend on the legal enforceability of claims, it can operate even in the absence of a legal and juridical environment. Hawaladars networks are often based on membership in the same family, village, clan, or ethnic group, and cheating is punished by effective ex-communication and \\"loss of honour\\"‚Äîleading to severe economic hardship. Hawaladars are often small traders who work at Hawala as a sideline or moonlighting operation. Hawala is based on a short term, discountable, negotiable, promissory note (or bill of exchange) called \\"Hundi\\". The Hawala debt is transferred from one debtor to another. After the debt is transferred to the second debtor, the first debtor is free from his/her obligation. As illustrated in the box to the right, (1) a customer (A, left-hand side) approaches a hawala broker (X) in one city and gives a sum of money (red arrow) that is to be transferred to a recipient (B, right-hand side) in another, usually foreign, city. Along with the money, he usually specifies something like a password that will lead to the money being paid out (blue arrows). (2b) The hawala broker X calls another hawala broker M in the recipient's city, and informs M about the agreed password, or gives other disposition instructions of the funds. Then, the intended recipient (B), who also has been informed by A about the password (2a), now approaches M and tells him the agreed password (3a). If the password is correct, then M releases the transferred sum to B (3b), usually minus a small commission. X now basically owes M the money that M had paid out to B; thus M has to trust X's promise to settle the debt at a later date. Transactions may completed in as little as 15 minutes. Kafala Kafala (literally \\"guarantee\\", \\"joining\\" or \\"merging\\") is called \\"surety\\" or \\"guaranty\\" in conventional finance. A third party accepts an existing obligation and becomes responsible for fulfilling someone's liability. At least sometimes used interchangeably with himalah and za‚Äôamah. There are five \\"Conditions Of Kafala\\": Conditions Of The Guaranteed, of the Guarantor, of the Object Of Guarantee, of the Creditor, and of Sigah For Constituting the Contract. There are different kinds of Kafala: Kafalah Bi Al-Nafs (Physical Guarantee) and Kafalah Bi Al-Mal (Financial Guarantee), with three types of financial guarantee: kafalah bi al-dayn (guarantee for debt), kafalah bi al-taslim (guarantee for delivery), and kafalah bi al-dark. Rahn Rahn (collateral or pledge contract) is property pledged against an obligation.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:97 It is also used to refer to the contract that secures a financial liability, with the actual physical collateral given another name‚Äîmarhoon. According to Mecelle, rahn is \\"to make a property a security in respect of a right of claim, the payment in full of which from the property is permitted.\\" Hadith tradition states that the Islamic prophet Muhammad purchased food grains on credit pledging his armor as rahn. * Types of rahn can be described in terms of who possesses them: Al-rahn al-heyazi (where the creditor holds the collateral); Al-rahn ghair al-heyazi (where the collateral is held by the debtor); Al-rahn al-musta'ar (where a third party provides the collateral). * They can also be described by subject type: Rahn al-manqul (moveable (manqul) property, such as vehicles), Rahn ghair al-manqul (immoveable property (ghair manqul), such as land, buildings).  Wakalah  A Wakalah is a contract where a person (the principal or muwakkel) appoints a representative (the agent or wakil) to undertake transactions on his/her behalf, similar to a power of attorney. It is used when the principal does not have the time, knowledge or expertise to perform the task himself. Wakalah is a non-binding contract for a fixed fee and the agent or the principal may terminate this agency contract at any time \\"by mutual agreement, unilateral termination, discharging the obligation, destruction of the subject matter and the death or loss of legal capacity of the contracting parties\\". The agent's services may include selling and buying, lending and borrowing, debt assignment, guarantee, gifting, litigation and making payments, and are involved in numerous Islamic products like Musharakah, Mudarabah, Murabaha, Salam and Ijarah. Types of wakalh include: general agency (wakalah 'ammah), specific agency (wakalah khassah), limited or restricted agency (wakalah muqayyadah), absolute or unrestricted agency (wakalah mutlaqah), binding wakalah (wakalah mulzimah), non-binding wakalah (wakalah ghair mulzimah), paid agency, non-paid agency, etc. An example of the concept of wakalah is in a mudarabah profit and loss sharing contract (above) where the mudarib (the party that receives the capital and manages the enterprise) serves as a wakil for the rabb-ul-mal (the silent party that provides the capital) (although the mudarib may have more freedom of action than a strict wakil).  Deposit side of Islamic banking  From the point of view of depositors, \\"Investment accounts\\" of Islamic banks‚Äîbased on profit and loss sharing and asset-backed finance‚Äîresemble \\"time deposits\\" of conventional banks. (For example, one Islamic bank‚ÄîAl Rayan Bank in the UK‚Äîtalks about \\"Fixed Term\\" deposits or savings accounts). In both these Islamic and conventional accounts the depositor agrees to hold the deposit at the bank for a fixed amount of time.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 105 In Islamic banking return is measured as \\"expected profit rate\\" rather than interest. \\"Demand deposits\\" of Islamic financial institutions, which provide no return, are structured with qard al-hasana (also known as qard, see above in Charitable lending) contracts, or less commonly as wadiah or amanah contracts, according to Mohammad O. Farooq. Restricted and unrestricted investment accounts At least in one Muslim country with a strong Islamic banking sector (Malaysia), there are two main types of investment accounts offered by Islamic banks for those investing specifically in profit and loss sharing modesJamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: pp. 253‚Äì54‚Äîrestricted or unrestricted. * Restricted investment accounts (RIA) enable customers to specify the investment mandate and the underlying assets that their funds may be invested in, * unrestricted investment accounts (UIAs) do not, leaving the bank or investing institution full authority to invest funds as \\"it deems fit\\", with no restrictions as to the purpose, geographical distribution or way of investing the account's funds. In exchange for more flexible withdrawal conditions, a UIA fund may combine/commingle pools of funds that invest in diversified portfolios of underlying assets. While investment accounts can be tailored to meet a diverse range of customer needs and preferences, funds in the account are not guaranteed by Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM) or also known as Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (MDIC) internationally. Some have complained that UIA accounts lack transparency, fail to follow Islamic banking standards, and lack of customer representation on the board of governors. Some institutions have hid poor performance of their UIAs behind \\"profit equalization funds\\" or \\"investment risk reserves\\", (which are created from profits earned during good times). \\"It is only when an Islamic financial institution approaches insolvency that the UIAs come to know that their deposits have eroded over the period.\\"Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 320 Demand deposits Islamic banks also offer \\"demand deposits,\\" i.e. accounts which promise the convenience of returning funds to depositors on demand, but in return usually pay little if any return on investment and/or charge more fees. =Qard= Because demand deposits pay little if any return and (according to orthodox Islamic law) Qard al- hasana (mentioned above) loans may not have any \\"stipulated benefit\\", the Qard mode is a popular Islamic finance structure for demand deposits. In this design, qard al-hasan is defined as \\"deposits whose repayment in full on demand is guaranteed by the bank,\\" with customer deposits constitute \\"loans\\" and the Islamic bank a \\"borrower\\" who pays no return (no \\"stipulated benefit\\")‚Äîin accordance with orthodox Islamic law.Ziauddin Ahmad, \\"Islamic Banking: The State of the Art\\", IDB Islamic Training and Research Institute, 1994.

However, according to Islamic jurisprudence, Qard al-hasana (literally, \\"benevolent loan\\") are loans to be extended as charity to the needy who will be required to replay the loan only (at least in some definitions) \\"if and when ... able\\".Munawar Iqbal and Philip Molyneux, Thirty Years of Islamic Banking: History, Performance and Prospects, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), p. 39, cited in This puts account holders in the curious position‚Äîaccording to one skeptic (M. O. Farooq)‚Äîof making charitable loans with their deposits to multi-million or billion dollar profit-making banks, who are obliged by jurisprudence (in theory) to \\"repay\\" (i.e. to honor customers' withdrawals) only if and when able. A further complication is that at least some conventional banks do pay a modest interest on their demand/savings deposits. In order to compete with them, Islamic banks sometimes provide an incentive of a Hibah (literally \\"gift\\") on the balance of the customers' savings accounts. In Iran, qard al-hasanah deposit accounts are permitted to provide a number of incentives in lieu of interest, including: # \\"grant of prizes in cash of kind, # reductions in or exemptions from service charges or agents‚Äô fees payable to banks, and # according priority in the use of banking finances.\\" Like dividends on shares of stock, hibah cannot be stipulated or legally guaranteed in Islam, and is not time bound. Nonetheless, one scholar (Mohammad Hashim Kamali) has complained: > \\"If Islamic banks routinely announce a return as a ‚Äògift‚Äô for the account > holder or offer other advantages in the form of services for attracting > deposits, this would clearly permit entry of riba through the back door. > Unfortunately, many Islamic banks seem to be doing precisely the same as > part of their marketing strategy to attract deposits.\\"Mohammad Hashim > Kamali. Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence [Islamic Texts Society, 3rd Ed., > 2003], p. 45, cited in = Wadiah and Amanah = Two other contracts sometimes used by Islamic finance institutions for pay-back-on-demand accounts instead of qard al- hasanah, are Wadi'ah (literally \\"safekeeping\\") and Amanah (literally \\"trust\\"). (The Jordan Islamic Bank uses Amanah (trust) mode for current accounts/demand deposits, the bank may only use the funds in the account at its \\"own risk and responsibility\\" and after receiving permission of the account owner.) Sources disagree over the definition of these two contracts. \\"Often the same words are used by different banks and have different meanings,\\"Volker Nienhaus, \\"The Performance of Islamic Banks: Trends and Cases\\", in: Chibli Mallat (Ed.), Islamic Law and Finance (London: Graham & Trotman), pp. 129‚Äì170, 131, cited in and sometimes wadiah and amanah are used interchangeably.Maulana Shamsud Doha, a Shariah expert with the Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited cited in Regarding Wadiah, there is a difference over whether these deposits must be kept unused with 100 percent reserve or simply guaranteed by the bank. Financialislam.com and Islamic-banking.com talk about wadiah deposits being guaranteed for repayment but nothing about the deposit being left the untouched/uninvested. Reuters Guide to Islamic finance glossary, on the other hand, states that in wadia \\"... the trustee does not have rights of disposal.\\" But according to Reuters there is a contract called Wadia yadd ad daman which is used by Islamic Banks \\"to accept current account deposit\\", and whereby the bank \\"guarantees repayment of the whole or part of the deposit outstanding in the account when repayment is due\\", and nothing about not having rights of disposal. (Two other authors, Vicary Daud Abdullah and Keon Chee, also talk of a contract with a guarantee of safe-keeping but which may be invested and not kept locked up called Wadiah yad dhamanah, apparently a different spelling of yadd ad damanh‚ÄîArabic for \\"guarantee\\"). Sources also differ on Amanah. Financialislam.com says it is a trust and an Islamic bank cannot use these funds for its operations, but Islamic-banking.com says a bank can if it \\"obtains authority\\" of depositor. Reuters talks about amanah needing to be \\"guarded and preserved\\". Abdullah and Chee, refer to amanah as a type of wadiah‚ÄîWadiah yad amanah‚Äîthat is property deposited on the basis of trust or guaranteeing safe custody and must be kept in the banks vaults. (All sources note that the trustee of amanah is not liable for loss of the property entrusted if there is an \\"unforeseen mishap\\" (Abdullah and Chee), \\"resulting from circumstances beyond its control\\" (financialislam.com), or unless the trustee has been in \\"breach of duty\\" (Reuters).)Mohammad Hashim Kamali. Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence [Islamic Texts Society, 3rd Ed., 2003], p. 335, cited in (According to Mohammad Obaidullah, Amanah is \\"unacceptable\\" as an \\"approach to deposits\\", but wadiah or qard are acceptable).Obaidullah, op. cit., 44. cited in Other sharia-compliant financial instruments= Sukuk (Islamic bonds)  Sukuk, (plural of ÿµŸÉ Sakk), is the Arabic name for financial certificates developed as an alternative to conventional bonds. They are often referred to as \\"Islamic\\" or \\"sharia-compliant\\" bonds. Different types of sukuk are based on different structures of Islamic contracts mentioned above (murabaha, ijara, wakala, istisna, musharaka, istithmar, etc.), depending on the project the sukuk is financing.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: p. 214 Instead of receiving interest payments on lent money as in a conventional bond, a sukuk holder is given \\"(nominal) part- ownership of an asset\\" from which he/she receives income \\"either from profits generated by that asset or from rental payments made by the issuer\\". A sukuk security, for example, may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company seeking to raise money from the sukuk issuance (and held in a Special Purpose Vehicle), so that sukuk holders can collect the property's profit as rent. Because they represent ownership of real assets and (at least in theory) do not guarantee repayment of initial investment, sukuk resemble equity instruments, but like a bond (and unlike equity) regular payments cease upon their expiration. However, in practice, most sukuk are \\"asset-based\\" rather than \\"asset-backed\\"‚Äîtheir assets are not truly owned by their Special Purpose Vehicle, and (like conventional bonds), their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: P. 210 The sukuk market began to take off around 2000 and as of 2013, sukuk represent 0.25 percent of global bond markets. The value of the total outstanding sukuk as of the end of 2014 was $294 billion, with $188 billion from Asia, and $95.5 billion from the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council According to a paper published by the IMF, as of 2015 the supply of sukuk, fell \\"short of demand and, except in a few jurisdictions, issuance took place without a comprehensive strategy to develop the domestic market.\\"  Takaful (Islamic insurance)  Takaful, sometimes called \\"Islamic insurance\\", differs from conventional insurance in that it is based on mutuality so that the risk is borne by all the insured rather than by the insurance company. Rather than paying premiums to a company, the insured contribute to a pooled fund overseen by a manager, and they receive any profits from the fund's investments. Any surplus in the common pool of accumulated premiums should be redistributed to the insured. (As with all Islamic finance, funds must not be invested in haram activities like interest- bearing instruments, enterprises involved in alcohol or pork.) Like other Islamic finance operations, the takaful industry has been praised by some for providing \\"superior alternatives\\" to conventional equivalents and criticized by others for not being significantly different from them. Omar Fisher and Dawood Y. Taylor state that takaful has \\"reinvigorate[d] human capital, emphasize[d] personal dignity, community self-help, and economic self- development\\". On the other hand, according to Muhammad Akram Khan, Mahmud El- Gamal, the cooperative ideal has not been followed in practice by most takaful companies‚Äîwho do not give their holders a voice in appointing and dismissing managers, or in setting \\"rates of premium, risk strategy, asset management and allocation of surpluses and profits\\".Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 409El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 170 In a different critique, Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui argues that cooperation/mutuality does not change the essence of insurance‚Äînamely using the \\"law of large numbers\\" to protect customers.Siddiqui, Mohammad Najatuallah \\"Islamic banking and finance in theory and practice: A survey of the state of the art.\\" Islamic Economic Studies, 13 (2) (February): pp. 1-48 As of the end of 2014 \\"gross takaful contributions\\" were estimated to be US$26 billion according to INCIEF (International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance). BusinessInsurance.com estimates the industry will reach $25 billion in size by the end of 2017. Islamic credit cards Sources dispute whether a truly shariah-compliant credit card has been developed. According to scholar Manzur Ahmad, despite their efforts, (at least as of 2008), Muslim scholars have not been able to find a legal basis in classical jurisprudence for an Islamic parallel of the credit card.Ahmad, Manzur. 2008. Credit cards ki shari'i hathiyat [Legal position of credit cards]. Urdu. Fikro Nazar (Islamibad) 45 (4) (April‚ÄìJune): pp. 83‚Äì125.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 255 Other scholars (Hossein Askari, Zamir Iqbal and Abbas Mirakhor) also agree that (at least as of 2009), attempts to devise \\"some sort of 'Islamic credit cards'\\" have found \\"no instrument that is compatible with shariah that can offer the same service as the conventional credit card\\".Askari, Hossein, Zamir Iqbal and Abbas Mirakhor (2009. New Issues in Islamic finance and economics: Progress and challenges. Singapore: John Wiley & Sons (Asia) p. 135) Among other complaints, critics note that credit cards encourage people to go into debt and to buy luxuries ‚Äî both unIslamic activities. Despite this, there are credit cards claiming to be shariah-compliant, generally following one of three arrangements, according to Lisa Rogak: # A bank provides a line of credit to the cardholder and charges a monthly or yearly usage fee tied to the outstanding balance of the line of credit. # A customer is allowed to buy an item with a card, but in the instant that the card goes through, the bank purchases the item before selling it to the cardholder at a higher price. # A lease-purchase agreement where the bank holds title to the purchased item until the cardholder makes the final payment. Another source (Beata Paxford writing in New Horizon) finds Islamic credit cards based not one of three but one of five structures: # ujra (the client simply pays an annual service fee for using the card) # ijara (card as a leased asset for which it pays installments on a regular basis) # kafala (the bank acts as a kafil (guarantor) for the transactions of the card holder. For its services, the card holder is obligated to pay kafala bi ujra (fee)). # qard ( the client acts as the borrower and the bank as a lender). # bai al-ina/wadiah (The bank sells a product at a certain price which is the pool of means available for the client from its credit card. And then the bank repurchases the item from the client at a lower price. The difference between the prices is the income of the bank. In this model, the client would have a ceiling limit of money it could spend.) According to yet another source, (Faleel Jamaldeen), Islamic \\"credit cards\\" are much like debit cards, with any transaction \\"directly debited\\" from the holder's bank account.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012: 107 According to Maryam Nasuha Binti Hasan Basri, et al., Islamic credit cards have played an important role in \\"the development and success of Islamic banking in Malaysia\\". Banks in that country offering Islamic credit cards as of sometime after 2012 include Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, CIMB Islamic Bank Berhad, HSBC Amanah Malaysia Berhad, Maybank Islamic Berhad, RHB Islamic Bank Berhad, Standard Chartered Berhad, Am Islamic Bank Berhad.  Islamic funds  Islamic mutual funds‚Äîi.e. professionally managed investment funds that pools money from many investors to purchase securities that have been screened for sharia compliance‚Äîhave been compared with \\"socially responsible\\" mutual funds‚Äîboth seeking some combination of high returns/low risk like conventional funds, but also screening their holdings according to a non-profit seeking criteria. Islamic funds may also be unit trusts which are slightly different from mutual funds. The funds may hold equity and/or sukuk securities and/or own real estate. Before a company's shares or other holdings can be purchased by a fund, the firm must be screened according to the sharia # to filter out any company whose business involves industries or types of transactions that are prohibited by Islamic law (alcohol, tobacco, pork, adult entertainment industry, gambling, weapons, conventional banks and insurance companies) but also # to make sure the company isn't \\"engaged in prohibited speculative transactions (involving uncertainty or gambling), which are likely leveraged with debt\\", the company's \\"financial ratios\\" must be examined to meet \\"certain financial benchmarks\\". Islamic equity funds were launched in the early 1990s, and began growing fairly rapidly in about 2004. As of 2014 there were 943 Islamic mutual funds worldwide and as of May 2015, they held $53.2 billion of assets under management. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia dominate the sector with about 69% of total assets under management. According to a 2015 study by Thomson Reuters, the market for Islamic funds has much room to grow as there is a \\"latent demand\\" for Islamic investment funds of $126 billion which \\"could rise to $185.1 billion by 2019\\". That survey of fund managers and investment firms found \\"an estimated 28 percent\\" of investors wanted to invest in sukuk-owning mutual funds, 21% in equity-owning funds and 15% in funds owning real estate. Benchmarks to gauge the funds' performance have been established by Dow Jones and the FTSE Global Islamic Index Series. (Dow Jones established the first Islamic investment index. There are now \\"thousands\\" of Dow Jones Islamic indices varying by size, region, strategy, theme. These include fixed-income indices.) At least in the earlier part of the 2000s, equity fund performance was not impressive. According to a study by Raphie Hayat and Roman Kraeuss of 145 Islamic equity funds from 2000 to 2009, the funds under-performed both Islamic and conventional equity benchmarks, particularly as the 2007‚Äì08 financial crisis set in. The study also found fund managers unsuccessful in their attempts to time the market. (An earlier study done by Said Elfakhani et al. before the 2007‚Äì08 financial crisis showed \\"no statistically significant difference\\" between Islamic and conventional funds in performance.) A disadvantage Islamic funds have compared to conventional ones is that since they must \\"exclude companies with debt-to-market capitalization\\" above a certain ratio (which the industry has set at 33 percent), and since a fall in the price of the stock raises its debt-to-market capitalization ratio, falling stock prices may force a fund to sell stocks, \\"whether or not that was the best investment strategy\\". This puts the fund at risk of being forced into \\"buying high and selling low\\".El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 12 = Sharia indices = * Credit Suisse HS50 Sharia Index * Dow Jones Islamic Market IndexDow Jones Islamic Market Index * Dubai Shariah Hedge Fund IndexDubai Shariah Hedge Fund Index * FTSE Sharia Global Equity IndexFTSE Sharia Global Equity Index * Jakarta Islamic Index, Indonesia * MSCI Barra Islamic IndexMSCI Barra Islamic Index * S&P; BSE 500 Shariah IndexS&P; BSE 500 Shariah Index Islamic derivatives While \\"almost all conservative Sharia scholars\\" believe derivatives (i.e. securities whose price is dependent upon one or more underlying assets) are in violation of Islamic prohibitions on gharar,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p. 111 global standards for Islamic derivatives were set in 2010, with help of Bahrain-based International Islamic Financial Market and New York-based International Swaps and Derivatives Association. This Tahawwut/\\"Hedging Master Agreement\\" provides a structure under which institutions can trade derivatives such as profit-rate and currency swaps.iran-daily.com (click on \\"Islamic Derivatives Standards Set\\") 2 March 2010 Attempts to unify various swap documentation and has \\"strong parallels\\" to the 2002 ISDA Master and Schedule of the conventional banking industry.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 170 Tahawwut has not being widely used as of 2015, according to Harris Irfan, as the market is \\"awash\\" with \\"unique, bespoke ... contracts documenting the profit rate swap\\", all using \\"roughly the same structure\\", but differing in details and preventing the cost saving of standardization.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: pp. 174‚Äì75 According to critic of Islamic finance El-Gamal, the Islamic finance industry has \\"synthesized\\" Islamic versions of \\"short and long sales as well as put and call options\\", (options are a \\"common form\\" of a derivative). The Islamic finance equivalent of a conventional call option (where the buyer has the right but not the obligation to buy in the future at a preset price, and so will make a profit if the price of the underlying asset rises above the preset price) are known as an urbun (down-payment) sale where the buyer has the right to cancel the sale by forfeiting her down-payment.El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 181 The Islamic equivalent of the \\"premium\\" in a conventional call option is known as a \\"down-payment\\", and the equivalent of the \\"strike price\\" is called the \\"preset price\\". A put option (i.e. where the seller has the right but not the obligation to sell at a preset price by some point in the future, and so will profit if the price of the underlying asset falls) is called a \`reverse urbun\` in Islamic finance. Short-selling (though not technically a derivative) is also forbidden by conservative scholars because the investor is selling an item for which he never became the owner. However \\"some Shariah-compliant hedge funds have created an Islamic-short sale that is Shariah-certified\\". Some critics (like Feisal Khan and El-Gamal) complain it uses a work-around (requiring a \\"down-payment\\" towards the shorted stock) that is no different than \\"margin\\" regulations for short-selling used in at least one major country (the US), but entails \\"substantially higher fees\\" than conventional funds. Wa'd Wa'd (literally \\"promise\\"), is a principle that has come to underpin or to structure shariah-compliant hedging instruments or derivatives. Conventional hedging products such as forward currency contracts and currency swaps are prohibited in Islamic Finance.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 144 Wa'd has been called \\"controversial\\" or a mimicry of conventional products and \\"'Islamic' in form alone\\". A \\"Double Wa'd\\" is a derivative that allows an investor to invest in and receive a return linked to some benchmark, sometimes ones that would normally be against shariah‚Äîsuch as an index of interest-bearing US corporate bonds. The investor's cash goes to a \\"special purpose entity\\" and they receive a certificate to execute the derivative.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 151 It involves a promise that on an agreed day in the future the investor will receive a return linked to whatever benchmark is chosen. Several features of the double wa'd (allegedly) make the derivative sharia-compliant: * a special purpose entity where the investor's cash goes to avoid commingling, * a shariah-compliant asset that is liquid and tradable‚Äîsuch as shares in a big company (like Microsoft) that has low levels of interest bearing debt (high levels being against shariah)‚Äîpurchased with the investor's cash. * a contract involving two mutually exclusive promises (hence \\"double\\"): # that on an agreed day in the future the investor will receive a return linked to a given benchmark; # that the bank will purchase the investor's asset \\"for a price equal to the benchmark\\"Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 152 So despite the fact that benchmark involves non-compliant investments, the contract is not \\"bilateral\\", because \\"the two undertaking promised are mutually exclusive\\", and this (proponents say) makes it in compliance with shariah.Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 153 In 2007, Yusuf DeLorenzo (chief sharia officer at Shariah Capital) issued a fatwa disapproving of the double wa'dIrfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: pp. 155‚Äì60 in these situations (when the assets reflected in the benchmark were not halal),Irfan, Heaven's Bankers, 2015: p. 159 but this has not curtailed its use. =Put and call options= Like the Islamic equivalent for short sales, a number of Islamic finance institutions have been using the down-payment sale or urbun as an sharia-compliant alternative to the conventional call option. In this mode the Islamic equivalent of the option \\"premium\\" is known as a \\"down-payment\\", and the equivalent of the \\"strike price\\" is called the \\"preset price\\". With a conventional call option the investor pays a premium for an \\"option\\" (the right but not the obligation) to buy shares of stock (bonds, currency, and other assets may also be shorted) in the hope that the stock's market price will rise above the strike price before the option expires. If it does, their profit is the difference between the two prices minus the premium. If it does not, their loss is the cost of the premium. When the Islamic investor uses an urbun they make a down-payment on shares or asset sale in hope the price will rise above the \\"preset price\\". If it does not their loss is the down-payment which they have the right to forfeit. A put option (where the investor hopes to profit by selling rather than buying at a preset price) is called a \`reverse urbun\` in Islamic finance. ;Criticism The urbun and reverse urbun has been criticized by Sherif Ayoub, and according to El-GamalEl-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p. 92 and Feisal Khan, the procedure has many critics among scholars and analysts. Microfinance Microfinance seeks to help the poor and spur economic development by providing small loans to entrepreneurs too small and poor to interest non-microfinance banks. Its strategy meshes with the \\"guiding principles\\" or objectives of Islamic finance, and with the needs of Muslim- majority countries where a large fraction of the world's poor live, many of them small entrepreneurs in need of capital. (Many of them also among the estimated 72 percent of the Muslim population who do not use formal financial services,Honohon, Patrick. 2007. \\"Cross-Country Variations in Household Access to Financial Services.\\" Presented at the World Bank Conference on Access to Finance, Washington, D.C., 15 March 2007, p. 1 often either because they are not available, and/or because potential customer believe conventional lending products incompatible with Islamic law). According to the Islamic Microfinance Network website (as of circa 2013),Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p. 301 there are more than 300 Islamic microfinance institutions in 32 countries, The products used in Islamic microfinance may include some of those mentioned above‚Äîqard al hassan, musharaka, mudaraba, salam, etc. Unfortunately, a number of studies have found Islamic microfinance reaching relatively few Muslims and lagging behind conventional microfinance in Muslim countries. Chiara Segrado writing in 2005 found \\"very few examples of actual MFIs [Microfinance institutions] operating in the field of Islamic finance and Islamic banks involved in microfinance\\". One 2012 report (by Humayon Dar and coauthors)Dar, Humayon A. Rizwan Rahman, Rizwan Malik and Asim Anwar Kamal, ed. 2012. Global Islamic finance report 2012. London: Edbiz Consulting. found that Islamic microfinance made up less than one percent of the global microfinance outreach, \\"despite the fact that almost half of the clients of microfinance live in Muslim countries and the demand for Islamic microfinance is very strong.\\" An earlier 2008 study of 126 microfinance institutions in 14 Muslim countriesKarim, \\"Islamic microfinance\\", 2008: p. 1 found similarly weak outreach‚Äîonly 380,000 members out of an estimated total population of 77 million there were \\"22 million active borrowers\\" of non- sharia-compliant microfinance institutions (\\"Grameen Bank, BRAC, and ASA\\") as of 2011 in Bangladesh, the largest sharia-compliant MFI or bank in that country had only 100,000 active borrowers. (Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank and microfinance banking, and other supporters of microfinance, though not part of the Islamic Banking movement, argue that the lack of collateral and lack of excessive interest in micro-lending is consistent with the Islamic prohibition of usury (riba).)Gabriel Rozenberg, Nobel prizewinner using micro-credit for macro benefit, The Times, 16 December 2006.Zeeshan Hasan, The Redefinition of Islamic Economics, The Daily Star, 27 August 1994.

Fossils have been found from the Nova Olinda Member of the Aptian-age Crato Formation in the Araripe and Lima Campos Basins of northeastern Brazil. Named in 2003, Susisuchus is the sole member of the family Susisuchidae, and is closely related to the clade Eusuchia, which includes living crocodilians. The type species is S. anatoceps, known from a single partial articulated skeleton that preserves some soft tissue. A second species, S. jaguaribensis, was named in 2009 from fragmentary remains. Discovery Size of S. anatoceps and other Brazilian Cretaceous crocodylomorphs The genus Susisuchus was first erected with the description of the type species S. anatoceps in 2003. S. anatoceps was found in the Aptian- age Crato Formation in the Araripe Basin, and was the first crocodyliform to be described from the formation. The holotype skeleton is the most complete known specimen of Susisuchus, including most of the bones except for those of the hindlimbs, and even traces of soft tissue. The specimen is thought to have been a desiccated carcass before it was buried and later fossilized. A second species, S. jaguaribensis, was named in 2009 from the Lima Campos Basin about from where the skeleton of S. anatoceps was uncovered. A new crocodyliform specimen from the Crato Formation was described in 2009. It can be distinguished from the two other crocodyliforms known from the formation, Araripesuchus and the trematochampsid Caririsuchus, on the basis of characteristics of the fibula and proportions of the femur and tibia. Since the limb elements differ from all other known crocodyliforms from the Araripe Basin, the specimen was tentatively classified as cf. Susisuchus sp. Description The holotype specimen of Susisuchus anatoceps includes a skull and lower jaw, forelimbs, parts of the axial skeleton, and some osteoderms. There are traces of soft tissue around both forelimbs and the digits of the right hand. S. jaguaribensis is known from far less material, but the fragmentary remains are enough to diagnose the species. Both species have a contact between the squamosal and parietal bones that is situated on the posterior border of the supratemporal fenestra, a hole in the skull table. Osteoderms Segmentation of dorsal osteoderms over time in advanced neosuchians (Susisuchus second from left). Susisuchus has a dorsal shield of osteoderms that is similar to those of the more derived clade Eusuchia, which includes living crocodilians. Susisuchus was one of the first mesoeucrocodylians to have a tetraserial paravertebral shield, which is formed from the dorsal osteoderms to make the back more rigid. In a tetraserial paravertebral shield, there are four separate rows of paravertebral osteoderms (osteoderms near the midline of the back). Earlier mesoeucrocodylians such as Bernissartia have biserial paravertebral shields, in which there are only two rows of paravertebral osteoderms. These two rows of large osteoderms became segmented into four smaller rows in Susisuchus. Susisuchus also has two rows of accessory osteoderms to either side of the paravertebral osteoderms which are not part of the shield. The segmentation of the paravertebral shield allowed for a greater degree of lateral flexibility in the trunk of Susisuchus. This flexibility would have enabled lateral undulation while swimming, resulting in greater efficiency in locomotion. Because the width of the paravertebral shield was not compromised by this segmentation, the back would remain rigid enough to overcome the forces encountered during high- walking, or walking semi-erect. However, the ability to high-walk would have restricted the size of Susisuchus. If Susisuchus grew any larger than , the forces encountered during high-walking would have been too great for the paravertebral shield to counteract. Classification Possible resting postures of S. anatoceps at various depths Susisuchus is closely related to Pachycheilosuchus from Glen Rose, Texas, United States, and Isisfordia from Winton, Queensland, Australia. All three genera are highly derived Early Cretaceous mesoeucrocodylians. In the initial description of Susisuchidae, Isisfordia was considered a possible member of the family, although the genus had not yet been named. However, with its naming in 2006, Isisfordia was placed within Eusuchia as the most basal member of the clade, while Susisuchus was placed outside Eusuchia as its sister taxon. Below is a cladogram from Salisbury et al. (2006) showing the relationships of Susisuchus and Isisfordia within Mesoeucrocodylia: Susisuchus has amphicoelus thoracic, lumbar and caudal (tail) vertebrae, meaning that the ends of the centra of these vertebrae are concave. The presence of this feature in a crocodyliform with a tetraserial paravertebral shield is unusual, and has been used to erect the family Susisuchidae, of which Susisuchus is the only member. Susisuchus can be considered a transitional form because it has a tetraserial paravertebral shield characteristic of eusuchians, but retains more primitive amphicoelus vertebrae characteristic of more basal crocodylomorphs. With the description of S. jaguaribensis as a second species of Susisuchus, the genus has been phylogenetically redefined as a node-based taxon including the last common ancestor of Susisuchus anatoceps and Susisuchus jaguaribensis and all of its descendants.

It was established as the Government Technical College in 1893 at Maradana, Colombo. In 1906 with renamed as Ceylon Technical College, it was the center for study of science such as chemistry, physics, biology and all technical training and development special in the areas of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. The Maradana Technical College Building has become a landmark of Colombo. When the Ceylon University College was established in 1921, the science section of the Ceylon Technical College was transferred to form the Department of Science, at the new University college which was affiliated to the University of London. The Technical College began preparing students for the external degrees in Engineering of the University of London since 1933 as well as for associate membership examinations of the professional institutions of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1942 the Ceylon Technical College was separated from the Education Department and was made the Ceylon Technical College Department. Several years later began courses in accountancy and commerce. Soon after in 1950 the engineering courses were transferred to the newly established Faculty of Engineering of the University of Ceylon. In 1966 the engineering technicians courses were transferred to the Institute of Practical Technology. In 1964 it was absorbed into the Department of Technical Education and Training over the next decades the several technical colleges were established around the country and the existing junior technical colleges where upgraded. Coming under the Department of Technical Education and Training, the principal technical college remained at Maradana, retain the name Maradana College of Technology along with 32 colleges of technology, and technical colleges today come under the purview of the Ministry of Tertiary Education & Training however it is currently under the Ministry of Youth Affears.

Freedman. Based on the French fairy tale by Charles Perrault, the film is the second remake and third version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical, which originally aired on television in 1957. Adapted from Oscar Hammerstein II's book, Freedman modernized the script to appeal to more contemporary audiences by updating its themes, particularly re-writing its main character into a stronger heroine. Co-produced by Whitney Houston, who also appears as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, the film stars Brandy in the titular role and features a racially diverse cast consisting of Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Bernadette Peters, Veanne Cox, Natalie Desselle, Victor Garber and Paolo Montalban. Following the success of the 1993 television adaptation of the stage musical Gypsy (1959), Houston approached Gypsy's producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron about starring in a remake of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella for CBS. However, development was delayed for several years, during which time the network grew disinterested in the project. By the time the film was greenlit by Disney for ABC, Houston felt that she had outgrown the title role, which she offered to Brandy instead. The decision to use a color-blind casting approach originated among the producers to reflect how society had evolved by the 1990s, with Brandy becoming the first black actress to portray Cinderella on screen. Among the most significant changes made to the musical, several songs from other Rodgers and Hammerstein productions were interpolated into the film to augment its score. With a production budget of $12 million, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ranks among the most expensive television films ever made. Heavily promoted to re-launch the anthology series The Wonderful World of Disney, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella premiered on ABC on November 2, 1997 to generally lukewarm reviews from critics. While most reviewers praised the film's costumes, sets and supporting cast, particularly Peters, Alexander and Goldberg, television critics were divided over Brandy and Houston's performances, as well as Disney's more feminist approach to Brandy's character. Cinderella proved a major ratings success, originally airing to 60 million viewers and establishing itself as the most-watched television musical in decades, earning ABC its highest Sunday-night ratings in 10 years. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was nominated for several industry awards, including seven Primetime Emmy Awards, winning one for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program. The program's success inspired Disney and ABC to produce several similar musical projects. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella is regarded by contemporary critics as a groundbreaking film due to the unprecedented diversity of its cast and Brandy's role.  Plot  Cinderella grows distracted while waiting upon her stepmother and two stepsisters in the marketplace, where she meets a charming young man. Despite being apprehensive about introducing herself to him at first, the pair bond upon realizing that both are dissatisfied with their sheltered home lives. After being scolded for speaking to a stranger, Cinderella returns to her step family's aid before realizing the young man is Prince Christopher. The Prince returns to the palace, where he is apprehended by his valet Lionel for once again visiting the kingdom disguised as a commoner, and learns that his parents, Queen Constantina and King Maximillian, plan to host a ball in order to find her son a suitable bride, an idea he strongly protests because he would rather marry for love. At Lionel‚Äôs suggestion, Constantina and Maximillian compromise that should Christopher not be successful in choosing a bride at the ball, he be allowed to find one on his own terms. Back at their own home, Cinderella wishes to attend the ball herself but her stepmother ridicules the idea, advising her that a prince would never be interested in her and to remain grateful for her current life. Solely determined to bolster their own wealth and social status by marrying the prince, Cinderella's step family leaves for the ball, leaving Cinderella home alone. Cinderella is soon visited by her Fairy Godmother for the first time, who encourages her to go to the ball; she magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into footmen and a coachman, mice into horses, and her rags into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. With her Fairy Godmother's warning that the spell will only last until midnight, Cinderella leaves for the ball. Yet to be impressed with any of the young women he meets, including Cinderella's Stepsisters, Christopher is growing weary until Cinderella arrives, and the pair instantly start dancing much to the annoyance of Cinderella‚Äôs step family, who can‚Äôt help but feel that the unidentified princess is familiar. Cinderella grows dismayed and wishes to leave when the King and Queen ask her about her background, but her Fairy Godmother encourages her to stay. The clock strikes midnight as Cinderella and the Prince share their first kiss, but Cinderella flees on foot while the spell is reverted, leaving behind a single glass slipper. With his parents' blessing, Christopher declares that he will marry whomever fits the slipper, even if it means trying it on every maiden in the kingdom. When Cinderella‚Äôs step family return home, they begin sharing embellished recounts of their evening. Cinderella explains that she can only imagine what it must have been like and they briefly bond over the memory, only for the Stepmother to soon recognize Cinderella as the mysterious princess with whom the Prince danced with, and insisting that she will never be more than a common girl. With final encouragement from her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella finally decides she will run away from home. When the Prince and Lionel arrive at Cinderella‚Äôs home, the Stepmother locks Cinderella in the kitchen hoping to keep her hidden. Cinderella‚Äôs step family ‚Äì including the Stepmother ‚Äì try on the slipper with little success. Lionel demands that the kitchen be unlocked and searched, and the Prince discovers Cinderella in the courtyard about to run away. When Christopher recognizes Cinderella from the marketplace, he tries the slipper on her foot and it fits perfectly. In the end, Cinderella and the Prince soon marry in a grand ceremony, while the palace gates close on her step family, forcing them to watch from outside.

Songwriters Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II originally wrote Cinderella as a musical exclusively for television starring Julie Andrews, which aired in 1957 to 107 million viewers. The telecast was remade in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren, airing annually on CBS from 1965 to 1972. The idea to remake Cinderella for television a second time originated as early as 1992, at which time producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron first approached the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization about obtaining the screen rights to the production. Further development was inspired by the success of CBS' adaptation of the stage musical Gypsy (1993) starring Bette Midler which, in addition to being credited with reviving interest in the genre, Zadan and Meron had also produced; CBS executive Jeff Sagansky asked Zadan and Meron to start brainstorming ideas for a follow-up shortly after Gypsy premiered. The day after Gypsy's original broadcast, Whitney Houston's agent Nicole David asked the producers if they were interested in developing a similar project starring her client, to whom they suggested Cinderella with Houston playing the titular role. CBS originally intended to air the completed film by the end of the 1994-1995 television season, but the project was continuously delayed. The network grew disinterested in favor of other titles by 1996, while Houston herself was already committed to several other projects. Zadan explained that, because of her popularity, Houston \\"had so many other concrete things that she was doing that 'Cinderella' took a back seat\\". The singer eventually aged to the point at which she no longer felt suitable for the role of Cinderella. Houston explained that by the time she became a wife and mother, she was not \\"quite feeling like Cinderella\\" anymore, believing that portraying the ingenue would require significant \\"reaching\\" for herself as an actress. alt=By the late 1990s, Disney had grown interested in reviving their long-running anthology program The Wonderful World of Disney. Hoping to relaunch the series using \\"a big event\\", Disney CEO Michael Eisner approached Zadan and Meron about potential television projects; the producers suggested Houston's Cinderella, which Eisner green-lit immediately. After relocating their production company, Storyline Entertainment, from CBC to Disney Studios, Zadan and Meron re-introduced the project to Houston. Agreeing that Cinderella required a certain \\"naivete ... that's just not there when you're 30-something\\", the producers suggested that Houston play Cinderella's fairy godmother instead, a role she accepted because it was \\"less demanding\\" and time consuming. For the titular role, Houston recommend singer Brandy, a close friend, in her first major film appearance. Brandy had been starring on the sitcom Moesha at the time but was still relatively new to television audiences, despite her success as a recording artist. Houston believed that Brandy possessed the energy and \\"wonder\\" to play Cinderella convincingly, admitting that their fictional relationship as godmother and goddaughter translates \\"well on-screen because it starts from real life\\"; when Houston telephoned Brandy to offer her the role, she introduced herself as her fairy godmother. Brandy, who identified \\"Cinderella\\" as her favorite fairy tale, was the first person of color to portray the character on screen, with both Brandy and Houston becoming the first African-American actresses to play their respective roles in any screen adaptation of the fairy tale, although an all- black modern-day re-telling of \\"Cinderella\\" entitled Cindy had premiered in 1978. Brandy likened being hand-selected for Cinderella by a performer she idolizes to a real-life fairy tale, accepting the role because she already had successful singing and acting careers, in addition to relating to the main character in several ways. The fact that Cinderella is traditionally depicted as white did not discourage Brandy from pursuing the role. Having grown up watching Caucasian actresses portray Cinderella, Houston felt that 1997 was \\"a good time\\" to cast a woman of color as the titular character, claiming the choice to use a multi-cultural cast \\"was a joint decision\\" among the producers, who agreed that every \\"generation [should] have their own 'Cinderella'.\\" Executive producer Debra Martin Chase explained that, despite enjoying Warren's performance as Cinderella, she and Houston \\"realized we never saw a person of color playing Cinderella\\", explaining, \\"To have a black Cinderella ... is just something. I know it was important for Whitney to leave this legacy for her daughter.\\" Chase hoped that the film mirroring an evolving society \\"will touch every child and the child in every adult\\", encouraging \\"children of all colors [to] dream.\\" One Disney executive would have preferred to have a white Cinderella and black Fairy Godmother and suggested singer- songwriter Jewel for the titular role. The producers refused, insisting that \\"The whole point of this whole thing was to have a black Cinderella.\\" Zadan maintains that Brandy was the only actress they had considered for the role, elaborating, \\"it's important to mention because it shows that even at that moment there was still resistance to having a black Cinderella. People were clearly still thinking, 'Multicultural is one thing, but do we have to have two black leads?\\" Robert Iscove was enlisted as the film's director, with Chris Montan and Mike Moder producing alongside Zadan and Meron. Houston was retained as an executive producer, alongside Chase. The film was co-produced by Walt Disney Telefilms, Storyline Entertainment and Houston's own production company BrownHouse Productions, becoming the latter's first project and Houston's executive producing debut. The film has a total of five executive producers: Houston, Chase, Zadan, Meron and David R. Ginsburg. Houston remained heavily involved in the film's production aspects, despite being relegated to a supporting acting role, retaining final approval over all creative decisions, particularly its multiracial cast. In addition to developing a good relationship with each other, the producers established a strong rapport with Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization President Ted Chapin. Although they were originally concerned that the organization would dismiss the idea of a multi-cultural cast, they were surprised when the company did not protest whatsoever. Mary Rodgers and James Hammerstein, relatives of the original composers, also approved this casting decision, with Mary maintaining that the production remains \\"true to the original\\" despite contemporary modifications to its cast and score, and James describing the film as \\"a total scrambled gene pool\\" and \\"one of the nicest fantasies one can imagine. James also believes Hammerstein would have approved of the color-blind casting, claiming he would have asked why the process took as long as it did. Meron believes that the organization was so open due to Houston's involvement, explaining, \\"Whitney was so huge at that time; to a lot of executives she was popular entertainment as opposed to being defined by her race.\\"  Writing  Television writer Robert L. Freedman became involved with the project as early as 1993. Although he had not written a musical before, Freedman was fond of Warren's version and drawn to the opportunity to work with Zadan and Meron, whose plans to remake Cinderella he had first read about in a Variety article. Aware that the film could potentially be groundbreaking, Freedman, Zadan and Meron collaborated on several new ideas for the remake, among them ensuring that Cinderella \\"was defined by more than falling in love\\", providing her with her own story arc that is beyond simply finding a love interest. The Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization allowed the filmmakers an unusual amount of freedom to modify the musical's script, among these changes making Cinderella a more active heroine; Meron credits Freedman with \\"giv[ing] her a little bit more of a backbone\\", ultimately developing the character into a more independent woman. Instead of making each character more modern, Zadan opted to \\"contemporize the qualities of the characters\\" instead. Freedman was more concerned with writing a film suitable for young girls in the 1990s than writing a multi-cultural film, inspired by stories about his wife being affected by women's representation in films when she was growing up. In a conscious decision to update the fairy tale for a modern generation, Freedman sought to deconstruct the messages young girls and boys were subjected to in previous versions of the fairy tale, explaining, \\"We didn't want the message to be 'just wait to be rescued\\", and thus altered the story to \\"reflect current ideas about what we should be teaching children.\\" Attempting to eliminate the element that Cinderella is simply waiting to be rescued by the prince, Freedman explained, \\"I'm not saying that it's the most feminist movie you'll ever see, but it is compared the other versions.\\" His efforts apply to both Cinderella and the prince; while Cinderella pines for independence from her stepfamily and actively disagrees with her stepmother's opinions about gender roles in marriage, the prince protests the idea of being married off to simply anyone his parents choose. Freedman continuously re-wrote the script between 1993 and 1997, particularly concerned about whether or not Houston would like his teleplay. Despite quickly earning approval from the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, Houston typically took longer to make decisions, and although the producers sent and continuously reminded her about the script, it remained unread for several months. Since Houston was still slated to play Cinderella at the time, production was unable to proceed without her involvement. In a final attempt to earn Houston's approval, Meron and Zadan enlisted Broadway actors to perform a read-through for the singer, namely La Chanze as Cinderella, Brian Stokes Mitchell as the prince, Theresa Meritt as the Fairy Godmother and Dana Ivey as the Stepmother. They hosted the table- read at the Rihga Royal Hotel in New York City, one of Houston's favorite locations at the time. Houston arrived at the reading several hours late, by which time some of the actors had grown frustrated and weary. Houston remained silent for most of the reading, barely engaging with the participants until the end of the table read when she finally declared her approval of the script and eventually sent the actors flowers to apologize for her tardiness. Houston believed strongly in the story's positive moral \\"that nothing is impossible and dreams do come true,\\" encouraging the filmmakers to imbue their version of Cinderella \\"with a 90s sensibility but to remain faithful to the spirit of the original.\\" Freedman identified Houston's eventual re-casting as the Fairy Godmother as a moment that instigated \\"the next round of rewriting\\", adapting her version of the character into a \\"worldly-wise older sister\\" to Cinderella, as opposed to the \\"regal maternal figure\\" that had been depicted prior. Houston described her character as \\"sassy, honest and very direct ... all the things that you'd like a godmother to be.\\" Houston found the most impressive part of the remake to be \\"the lessons youngsters can learn about dreams and self-image\\". According to Ray Richmond of Variety, Freedman's teleplay is faster in pace and contains more dialogue than previous versions, although A Problem Like Maria: Gender and Sexuality in the American Musical author Stacy Ellen Wolf believes that the teleplay borrows more from the 1957 version than Joseph Schrank's 1965 version due to sharing much of its humor, dialogue and gender politics with Hammerstein's book. Despite being more similar to the original musical than the 1965 remake in style and structure, the script's \\"values and tone\\" have been updated. The New York Daily News journalist Denene Millner observed that although the remake is \\"not all that different from the original\\", its version of Cinderella is more outspoken, the prince is more interested in finding someone he can talk to as opposed to simply \\"another pretty face\\", as well as \\"a hip fairy godmother who preaches self-empowerment\\" as a result of its \\"'90s flair\\". The remake reflected a changing society, containing themes discussing self-reliance and love. According to George Rodosthenous, author of The Disney Musical on Stage and Screen: Critical Approaches from 'Snow White' to 'Frozen', \\"traces of sexism\\" were removed from the script in favor of creating \\"a prince for a new era\\" while maintaining its \\"fundamental storyline\\"; this version of the story emphasizes that the prince has fallen in love with Cinderella because she is funny and intelligent, in addition to being beautiful. Freedman granted the prince \\"a democratic impulse\\" that drives him to spend time among the citizens of his country in the hopes of better understanding them. Cinderella and the prince are also shown meeting and developing an interest in each other prior to the ball, lessening the \\"love at first sight\\" element at the behest of the producers, by having Cinderella and the prince meet and talk to each other first, an idea that would be reused in subsequent adaptations of the story. Cinderella has a conversation with the prince in which she explains that a woman should always be treated \\"like a person. With kindness and respect\\", which some critics identified as the studio's attempt to make the film more feminist. Cinderella was provided with a more empowering motive in that her fairy godmother reminds her that she has always been capable of bettering her own situation; she \\"just didn't know it\\" yet. According to Entertainment Weekly contributor Mary Sollosi, none of the script's dialogue requires that any of its cast or characters be white, with the film also lacking references to the races or ethnicities of the characters whatsoever. The Los Angeles Times critic Howard Rosenberg wrote that the prince's inability to recognize that some of the women trying on the glass slipper in his search for Cinderella are white as part of \\"what makes this \\"Cinderella\\" at once a rainbow and color-blind, a fat social message squeezed into a dainty, glass slipper of a fable.\\"  Casting  Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was the first time the \\"Cinderella\\" story was adapted for a racially diverse cast, having been conceived in this format from inception. The producers hoped that the cast's diversity would enhance the film's \\"universal appeal\\" and interest children of all ethnicities. The casting directors recruited performers from various entertainment facets, spanning the Broadway, television, film and music industries. Casting the stepmother proved particularly challenging since most of the white actresses considered for the role felt uneasy about acting cruelly towards a black Cinderella; Bette Midler was among several actresses who declined. Bernadette Peters was ultimately cast as Cinderella's stepmother, her second villainous role after originating the Witch in the stage musical Into the Woods (1986). Peters' stepmother was adapted into a more comical version than previous incarnations of the character due to the actress' comedic background. Jason Alexander was cast as the prince's valet Lionel, an entirely new character created for comic relief. Alexander accepted the role despite being paid significantly less than his Seinfeld salary because, in addition to hoping to earn Zadan and Meron's favor for the title role in a potential film adaptation of the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979), he hoped that Cinderella would positively impact the future of television musicals. Describing the project as both a major opportunity and responsibility, Alexander acknowledged that Cinderella's failure to succeed could potentially jeopardize the future of musical films altogether. Furthermore, Alexander insisted that Lionel be different from his Seinfeld character George Costanza, despite Freedman originally writing several in-jokes that alluded to Alexander's most famous role, prompting him to revise several of the actor's scenes accordingly. Whoopi Goldberg accepted the role of Queen Constantina because Cinderella reminded her of a period when television specials were \\"major event[s]\\" before home video made such programs available and re-watchable at virtually any time, and hoped that the film would re-introduce the tradition of watching it live and \\"become part of the fabric of our lives again.\\" Goldberg found the film's colorful cast to be reflective of \\"who we are\\", describing it as \\"more normal\\" than all-black or all-white casts. Victor Garber, who was cast as King Maximillian, also enjoyed the film's multicultural cast, describing the fact that his character has an Asian son with an African-American queen as \\"extraordinary\\". The actor concluded \\"There's no reason why this can't be the norm.\\" Casting the prince was significantly more time consuming, with Chase likening the process to searching for the owner of Cinderella's glass slipper. Auditions were held in both Los Angeles and New York. Several well-known actors auditioned for the role, including Wayne Brady, Antonio Sabato, Jr., Marc Anthony and Taye Diggs, the latter of whom was highly anticipated due to his starring role in the musical Rent at the time. The final actor to audition for the film, Paolo Montalban was ultimately cast as Prince Christopher in his film debut; Montalban had been an understudy in Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical The King and I at the time. Despite being late for the final day of auditions, Montalban impressed the producers with his singing voice. Montalban enjoyed this version of the prince character because \\"he isn't just holding out for a pretty girl ... he's looking for someone who will complete him as a person, and he finds all of those qualities in Cinderella.\\" Company alumna Veanne Cox and television actress Natalie Deselle, respectively, were cast as Cinderella's stepsisters. Cosmopolitan's Alexis Nedd wrote that the film's final cast consisted of \\"Broadway stars, recording artists, relative unknowns, and bona fide entertainment superstars.\\" Due to the well-known cast, tabloid newspapers often fabricated stories of the cast engaging in physical altercations, particularly among Brandy, Houston and Goldberg, all of which were proven false. This version of Cinderella was the first live-action fairy tale featuring color-blind casting to be broadcast on television, boasting one of the most diverse ensemble casts to appear on television at the time.  Music  Freedman's final teleplay is 11 minutes longer than previous adaptations, in turn offering several opportunities for new songs, some of which the producers felt necessary. Disney asked the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization to be as open about changes to the musical's score as they had been about the script and cast. Music producers Chris Montan and Arif Mardin were interested in combining \\"Broadway legit with Hollywood pop\\", re-arranging the musical's original orchestration in favor of achieving a more contemporary sound by updating its rhythm and beats. Montan, who oversees most of the music for Disney's animated films, had been interested in crossing over into live- action for several years and identified Cinderella as one of the first opportunities in which he was allowed to do so. The musicians were not interested in completely modernizing the material in the vein of the musical The Wiz (1974), opting to simply \\"freshen\\" its orchestration by incorporating contemporary rhythms, keyboards and instruments, similar to the way in which the studio approaches animated musicals. Although filmmakers are usually hesitant to interpolate songs from other sources into adaptations of Rodgers and Hammerstein's work, Ted Capin, President of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, challenged the producers to conceive \\"compelling reasons\\" as to why they should incorporate new material into the remake, allowing the filmmakers significant freedom on the condition that the additions remain consistent with the project. Three songs not featured in previous versions of the musical were added to augment the film's score, each of which was borrowed from a different Rodgers and Hammerstein source; these additions are considered to be the most dramatic of the changes made to the musical. \\"The Sweetest Sounds\\", a duet Rodgers wrote himself following Hammerstein's death for the musical No Strings (1962), was used to explore the lead couple's initial thoughts and early relationship upon meeting each other in the town square, performing separately until they are united. The filmmakers found this song particularly easy to incorporate.alt=Middle-aged woman with long, curly hair wearing a black sleeveless dress.\\"Falling in Love With Love\\", which Rodgers wrote with lyricist Lorenz Hart for the musical The Boys from Syracuse (1938), was adapted into a song for Cinderella's stepmother, a character who seldom sings or expresses her innermost feelings in previous adaptations of the fairy tale. She advises her own daughters about love and relationships, warning them not to confuse love with marriage. The filmmakers wanted to prove that Stepmother is not simply \\"an evil harridan\\" but rather a \\"product of bitter experience\\", for which Freedman himself suggested \\"Falling in Love With Love\\". Despite concerns that Hart's \\"biting\\" lyrics would sound too abrasive against the rest of the score, James, Hamerstein's son, was very much open to the idea. While Mary, Rodgers' daughter, was initially against using \\"Falling in Love With Love\\", she relented once Peters was cast as the Stepmother, feeling confident that the Broadway veteran was capable of \\"put[ting] a different kind of spin on it.\\" The filmmakers also agreed that it would be wasteful to cast Peters without allowing her to sing. According to Peters, the song demonstrates her character's disappointment in her own life, exploring why she has grown so embittered and jealous of Cinderella. Performed while they prepare for the ball, the song was offered \\"a driving, up-tempo arrangement\\" for Peters. Although its original melody is retained, the music producers adapted the waltz into a \\"frenetic Latin-tinged number in duple meter\\" more suitable for the conniving character. The filmmakers agreed that Alexander deserved his own musical number due to his experience as a musical theatre performer, and decided to combine the Steward's \\"Your Majesties\\" with the Town Crier's \\"The Prince is Giving a Ball\\" from the original musical into an elaborate song-and-dance sequence. Broadway lyricist Fred Ebb was recruited to contribute original lyrics to the new arrangement \\"that melded stylistically with the Hammerstein originals.\\" Despite the fact that Hammerstein's will states that altering his work is prohibited, James believes his father would have appreciated Ebb's contribution since the songwriter had been known to enjoy collaborating with new lyricists. Houston's Fairy Godmother was expanded into a more musical role by having the character preface the film with a downtempo rendition of \\"Impossible\\". Describing herself as familiar with the \\"flavor\\" of Rodgers and Hammerstein's material, Houston opted to perform their songs simply as opposed to her signature pop, R&B; or gospel approach. Zadan and Meron wanted Houston to end the film with a wedding song for Cinderella and Christopher. Although the producers agreed that Houston's character would sing the film's closing number, selecting a song for Houston proved a challenge. Few songs remaining in Rodgers and Hammerstein's repertoire were deemed suitable until they re-discovered \\"There's Music in You\\", a little-known song from the film Main Street to Broadway (1953), in which the songwriters play themselves. Despite being covered by singer Bing Crosby, \\"There's Music in You\\" remained obscure for 40 years until its re-discovery. The original song lacked a bridge and was deemed inferior to Houston's trademark vocals, thus it was combined with the bridge from \\"One Foot, Other Foot\\" from Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical Allegro (1947). Additionally, samples of \\"Impossible\\" and the wedding march were interpolated into its melody. Mary described the completed song as \\"Whitney- fied\\". Meron maintains that these adjustments helped the composition resemble a \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein song that sounds like a new Whitney Houston record\\". Capin considered \\"There's Music in You\\" to be a \\"perfect\\" addition to the original score because, when combined with \\"The Sweetest Sounds\\", it \\"bookends Cinderella with songs about music\\" while demonstrating how Cinderella has matured throughout the course of the film. Mary said about the new arrangements, \\"I'm crazy about what they've done with the music ... They save the original sound while updating it.\\" Rob Marshall choreographed and staged the film's musical numbers, which he credits with teaching him how to choreograph dance sequences for motion pictures. Brandy learned to waltz for the role, a task which took her two weeks to perfect. To film the \\"Impossible\\" musical sequence, Houston rode on a wooden pulley to simulate the effect that she was flying alongside Cinderella's pumpkin carriage. Brandy found the recording process \\"challenging\\" because the film's songs were different than any material she had recorded before, explaining that she was nervous since her \\"voice wasn't fully developed\\", especially in comparison to her idol Houston and at times struggling to project. Houston would encourage the singer to \\"Sing from your gut\\" as opposed to singing from her chest in order to get her to sing louder. Goldberg, who is not primarily known as a singer, also provided her own vocals for the film, by which some of the filmmakers and cast were pleasantly surprised; Goldberg found the process somewhat difficult due to being surrounded by several professional singers, namely Houston, Brandy and Peters. The studio originally planned to release an original soundtrack featuring the film's music. However, this idea was abandoned due to conflicts between Houston and Brandy's respective record labels.  Filming  Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was the first of the three versions of the musical to be shot on film. Principal photography began on June 23, 1997 and was completed over a 28-day period, primarily on stages 22 and 26 at Sony Picture Studios in Culver City, California, which had been the location of MGM Studios during what is now revered as \\"the golden age of the movie musical.\\" With a then-unprecedented production budget of $12 million, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella is one of the most expensive television films ever made; some media publications dubbed the program \\"the most expensive two hours ever produced for television.\\" In September 1997, Disney Telefilms president Charles Hirschhorn identified the film as the studio's most costly upcoming project. According to A. J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly, the film's budget was approximately four-times that of a typical television film. Disney granted the producers this amount because they felt confident that the film would eventually make its budget back once it was released on home video. Zadan agreed that \\"We've only been able to make [expensive musicals] because of the home-video component. The show loses money, and the home video [market] makes back the money that you lose.\\" alt=Middle-aged African-American woman with dreadlocks, looking away from the camera and smiling with her right cheek rested upon her folded hands.The film's costumes were designed by Ellen Mirojnick, who aspired towards making them \\"both funny and stylish\\" in appearance. The main characters were dressed in costumes that complimented their roles and personalities, the stepfamily's \\"loud\\" dresses in contrast to Cinderella's warmer, more neutral tones. Meanwhile, the royal family wears different shades of purple, a color often associated with royalty. In order to give Cinderella's ballgown a \\"magical look\\", Mirojnick combined blue and white detailing into the dress, in addition to incorporating a peplum, a design element that had not been used in previous versions of the gown. Cinderella's \\"glass slippers\\" were made of shatterproof acrylic as opposed to glass, and only one pair was designed to fit Brandy's feet; the shoe the prince discovers and carries on a pillow in search of its owner was designed to be extremely small in order to give it the appearance of being \\"incredibly delicate\\", with Iscove describing it as \\"too small for any human\\" foot. In addition to Cinderella herself, Mirojnick costumed all female guests attending the prince's ball in various shades of blue, ranging from aqua to sapphire; Meron believes that Mirojnick's use of color in the characters' costumes distracts from the various skin colors of the film's actors. Meanwhile, the villagers' costumes range in style from \\"nineteenth-century peasant chic to '40s-esque brocade gowns with exploding collars, bustles, and ruffles.\\" The costume department originally created fake jewelry for Goldberg's character, which consisted of rhinestones for her to wear during the film's ballroom and wedding sequences. However, the actress insisted that the film's queen should wear real jewelry instead and personally contacted jeweler Harry Winston to lend the production millions of dollars worth of jewels, which ultimately included a 70-carat diamond ring and a necklace worth $9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Winston supplied the set with three armed guards to ensure that the jewelry remained protected at all times and was safely returned at the end of filming. The Brooklyn Paper estimates that Goldberg wore approximately $60 million worth of jewelry for the film. The film's sets were designed by Randy Ser, while art direction was headed by Ed Rubin, who opted to combine a \\"bright and bold\\" color palette with \\"a great deal of subtlety\\". Iscove identified the film's time period as \\"nouveau into deco,\\" while also incorporating influences from the work of Gustav Klimt. Prince Christopher's palace was built on the same location as what had been the yellow brick road from the film The Wizard of Oz (1939), thus the palace's courtyard bricks were painted yellow in homage to the classic film. Due to the film's child-friendly message, children and family members of the cast and crew visited the set regularly, including Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown and husband Bobby Brown. Mary and James often visited, as well as Chapin. During a scheduled visit in July, approximately midway through the filming process, Mary and James previewed early footage of the film and met the cast. Hailing the sets as \\"the most incredible\\" she had ever seen, Mary described Brandy as \\"a sweet, wonderful young woman ... I love the fact that millions of children are going to hear her sing 'I can be whatever I want to be.' What better message could we send than that?\\" Towards the end of filming, the producers realized that they did not have enough money to pay for extras and additional costs, and Disney refused to loan any more money to the production. The producers agreed to finance the remainder of the project using their own money, while Goldberg volunteered to donate the rest of her daily salary to completing the production. Release= Marketing and premiere  Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was heavily promoted as the centerpiece of the newly revived Wonderful World of Disney; Disney themselves have referred to Cinderella as the \\"grande dame\\" of the anthology, while Jefferson Graham of the Chicago Sun-Times touted the film the \\"crown jewel\\" of the revival. The same newspaper reported that Cinderella was one of 16 upcoming television films commissioned for the series. One of ABC's promotional advertisements for Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella featured a black-and- white scene from the original 1957 broadcast in which Andrews sings \\"In My Own Little Corner\\", which transitions into Brandy singing her more contemporary rendition of the same song, its \\"funkier orchestration\\" sounding particularly noticeable opposite Andrews' original. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella premiered on October 13, 1997 at Mann's Chinese Theatre, which Houston attended with her husband and daughter. The film's impending premiere coincided with the launch of the official Rodgers and Hammerstein website, which streamed segments from the upcoming broadcast via RealVideo from October 27 to November 3, 1997. These segments were again interpolated with excerpts from the 1957 version. A public screening of the film was hosted at the Sony Lincoln Square Theatre in New York on October 27, 1997. Most of the film's cast ‚Äì Brandy, Houston, Cox, Garber, Desselle and Montalban ‚Äì was present; Goldberg and Alexander were unable to attend.  Broadcast and viewership  Houston originally hoped that the film would earn a theatrical release. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella premiered on November 2, 1997 during The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC, 40 years after the original broadcast. Disney CEO Michael Eisner introduced the program. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was a major ratings success, breaking several television records much like the original did. The telecast aired to over 60 million viewers who watched at least a portion of the film, becoming the most-watched television musical in several years and earning more viewership than 1993's Gypsy. According to the Nielsen ratings, Cinderella averaged a 22.3 rating and 31 share (although it was originally estimated that the program had earned only an 18.8 rating), which is believed to have been bolstered by the film's strong appeal towards women and adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Translated, this means that 31 percent of televisions in the United States aired the premiere, while 23 million different households tuned in to the broadcast. Surprisingly, 70 percent of Cinderella's total viewership that evening consisted of females under the age of 18, specifically ages two to 11. The broadcast attracted a particularly high number of younger audience members, including children, teenagers and young adults, in turn making Cinderella the television season's most popular family show. In addition to being the most- watched program of the evening, Cinderella remained the most-watched program of the entire week, scoring higher ratings than the consistently popular shows ER and Seinfeld. The film became ABC's most-watched Sunday night program in more than 10 years, as well as the most-watched program during the network's two-hour 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm time slot in 13‚Äì14 years, a record it broke within its first hour of airing. AllMusic biographer Steve Huey attributes the film's high ratings to its \\"star power and integrated cast\\". Additionally, the popularity of Cinderella boosted the ratings of ABC's television film Before Women Had Wings, which premiered immediately following the program and consequently earned a rating of 19, retaining much of its viewership from Cinderella's broadcast. ABC's chief researcher Larry Hyams recalled that few \\"predicted the magnitude of Cinderella's numbers\\". ABC re-aired the film on February 14, 1999 (Valentine's Day), which was watched by 15 million viewers. Fuse broadcast Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella on November 2, 2017 in honor of the film's 20th anniversary, naming the television special A Night Of Magic: 20th Anniversary of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. The network also aired \\"Cinderella\\"-themed episodes of Brandy's sitcom Moesha and the sitcom Sister, Sister in commemoration. Home media Shortly after the film's premiere, audiences soon began demanding a swift home video release, which the studio soon began bringing to fruition. Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella was released on VHS February 10, 1998, which became the highest- selling home video release of any made-for-television film at that time, selling one million copies its first week. By February 1999, the video had sold more than two million copies. According to Zadan, musical films struggled to sell well on home video until Cinderella was released. The film was released on DVD on February 4, 2003. In July 2020, fans and Brandy herself began heavily petitioning on social media to have the film added to the streaming service Disney+, which currently streams several other Disney- produced film versions of the fairy tale.  Reception = Critical response  Playbill's Rebecca Paller reviewed the New York screening as \\"overflowing with star performances, lavish sets\\" and \\"lush rainbow-hued costumes\\", describing its score as \\"fresher than ever.\\" According to Paller, the screening resembled a Broadway tryout more than a film preview since the audience reportedly applauded at the end of every song. Praising its sets, costumes, choreography and script, Paller concluded \\"everything about the TV play worked\\", predicting that both young and adult audiences will find the program memorable. Although well-received by audiences, Cinderella premiered to generally lukewarm reviews from most critics, who were critical of some of its songs, cast and feminist approach, at times deeming it inferior to the 1957 and 1965 versions. Some purist fans were less impressed with the contemporary arrangements of Rodgers and Hammerstein's original music. Critics have softened towards the film over time, which has earned 86% on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. Praising its score and faithfulness to the source material, Eileen Fitzpatrick of Billboard called the film a \\"sure to please\\" remake while lauding Brandy's performance, joking that the singer \\"slips into the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway-like score as easily as Cinderella fits into the glass slipper\\". Fitzpatrick went on to write that the supporting cast lacks \\"a weak link\\" entirely, finding it obvious that Houston enjoyed her material and commending the contributions of Peters, Alexander, Goldberg, Garber, Cox and Deselle. New York entertainment critic John Leonard praised the cast extensively, highlighting the performance of Brandy whom the writer said possesses \\"the grace to transfigure inchoate youth into adult agency\\" while complimenting the work of Houston, Montalban, Peters, Goldberg and Alexander, the latter of whom the critic identified as a reminder \\"that he belonged to musical theater before he ever shacked up with Seinfeld's slackers.\\" Leonard also praised the actors' musical performances, particularly Peters' \\"Falling in Love with Love\\", but admitted that he prefers the songs used in Disney's 1950 animated adaptation of the fairy tale. In addition to receiving praise for its overall craftsmanship and musical format, critics appreciated the film's color-blind cast. Describing the film as \\"Short, sweet and blindingly brightly colored\\", TV Guide film critic Maitland McDonagh wrote that Cinderella is \\"overall ... a pleasant introduction to a classic musical, tweaked to catch the attention of contemporary youngsters.\\" McDonagh observed that the color-blindness of the entire cast spares the film from potentially suffering \\"disturbing overtones\\" that otherwise could have resulted from images of an African-American Cinderella being mistreated by her Caucasian stepmother. Despite calling the supporting cast \\"unusually strong\\", the critic felt Brandy and Houston acted too much like their own selves for their performances to be considered truly compelling. alt=Teresa Talerico, writing for Common Sense Media, praised the film's costumes, sets and musical numbers while lauding Peters, Goldberg and Houston's performances, but found the choreography stiff. In a mixed review, The New York Times journalist Caryn James found the film's multi-racial cast and incorporation of stronger Rodgers and Hammerstein material improve Cinderella overall, but admitted the production fails to \\"take that final leap into pure magic\\", dismissing it as \\"a cobbled-together 'Cinderella' for the moment, not the ages.\\" While lauding Brandy and Montalban's efforts, James described the film's feminist re-writes as \\"clumsy\\" and accused it of wasting Houston's talent. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe complained that despite its \\"visual charm\\" and strong performances, the film lacks \\"romance, warmth, and a bit of snap in the dance department\\", failing to become \\"anything more than a slight TV outing that feels more Nickelodeon than Broadway.\\" Describing the film as \\"big, gaudy, miles over the top and loads of fun\\", Variety's Ray Richmond found some of its aspects distracting and opined that the entire project \\"could have been toned down a notch and still carried across plenty of the requisite spunk.\\" While praising Brandy's subtlety, Richmond found Houston's interpretation of the Fairy Godmother to be an overzealous, \\"frightening caricature, one certain to send the kids scurrying into Mom's lap for reassurance that the good woman will soon go away.\\" Similarly, television critic Ken Tucker, writing for Entertainment Weekly, praised Brandy and Alexander but found that Houston \\"strikes a wrong note as a sassy, vaguely hostile Fairy Godmother\\" while dismissing Montalban as \\"a drearily bland prince\\" and describing most of the musical numbers as \\"clunky\\", predicting that children \\"will sleep through\\" the film. Although Houston and Brandy's on-screen pairing was highly anticipated, the supporting cast of Peters, Goldberg and Alexander ultimately garnered most of the program's praise. Television critic Howard Rosenberg, in a review for the Los Angeles Times, described Brandy's singing as superior to her acting, resulting in \\"a tender, fresh Cinderella\\". Attributing most of the \\"magic\\" to Alexander, Peters and Goldberg, Rosenberg was unimpressed with Montalban and Houston, who he described as \\"pastel as a prince can get (although it's not his fault the character is written as a doofus)\\" and \\"not much of a fairy godmother\\", respectively. For Entertainment Weekly, Denise Lanctot praised the musical numbers and choreography but found Brandy's performance underwhelming, describing it as \\"oddly vacuous\\" and \\"Barbie-doll blank\\" while criticizing her singing. However, she called Montalban \\"perfectly charming\\" and \\"The real fairy tale\\". Despite praising Houston, Montalban, Alexander and Peters, People's Terry Kelleher found Brandy's vocals inferior to Houston's and \\"lack[ing] the vocal command and emotive power to\\" support the film's ballads. Harlene Ellin of the Chicago Tribune wrote that, despite its aesthetics and color-blind casting, the film \\"lacks the requisite charm and spark\\", concluding that the production \\"doesn't capture the heart\\" despite its beauty. While praising the performances of Houston, Peters and Montalban, Ellin joked that \\"Cinderella's glass slippers are far too big for Brandy\\", criticizing her acting while saying that the singer \\"delivers her lines so timidly and flatly that it's hard to stay focused on the story when Brandy is on the screen\\", concluding that her co-stars \\"only makes her weak acting all the more glaring\\", and causing her to wonder how the film would have turned out had Houston been cast as the lead instead. The Oxford Handbook of The American Musical editor Raymond Knapp believes that Brandy's sitcom experience negatively affected her acting, writing that she often overreacts and delivers lines \\"as if they were punch lines rather than emotionally generated phrases.\\" Theater director Timothy Sheader found the production \\"harsh and unmagical\\". In 2007, theatre historian John Kenrick dismissed the film as \\"a desecration of Rodgers & Hammerstein's only original TV musical\\" despite its popularity, advising audiences to only watch the previous versions of the musical. In its year-end edition, TV Guide ranked the program the best television special of 1997. The diversity of the cast prompted some members of the media to dub the film \\"rainbow 'Cinderella'\\", Laurie Winer of the Los Angeles Times summarized that the film's cast \\"is not just rainbow, it's over the rainbow\\", observing that \\"the black queen (Goldberg) and white king (Victor Garber), for instance, produce a prince played by Filipino Paolo Montalban\\" while \\"Cinderella withstands the company of a white stepsister (Veanne Cox) and a black one (Natalie Desselle), both, apparently, birth daughters of the mother played by Bernadette Peters.\\" A writer for Newsweek believed that Brandy's Cinderella falling in love with a non-black prince reflects \\"a growing loss of faith in black men by many black women\\", explaining, \\"Just as Brandy's Cinderella falls in love with a prince of another color, so have black women begun to date and marry interracially in record numbers.\\" The Sistahs' Rules author Denene Millner was less receptive towards the fact that Brandy's Cinderella falls in love with a non-black prince, arguing, \\"When my stepson who's 5 looks at that production, I want him to know he can be somebody's Prince Charming.\\"  Awards and nominations  The film received several accolades. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special. At the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1998, the film was also nominated for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program, Outstanding Choreography, Outstanding Costume Design for a Variety or Music Program, Outstanding Directing for a Variety or Music Program, Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special, and Outstanding Music Direction, ultimately winning one for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program, which was awarded to Julie Kaye Fanton, Edward L. Rubin and Randy Ser. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was the 13th most nominated program at that year's ceremony. The film also won an Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design ‚Äì Awards Show, Variety, Music, or Non-Fiction Program, awarded to Ser. Freedman's teleplay was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Children's Script. Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella was nominated for three NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special, while both Brandy and Goldberg were nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Television Movie or Mini-Series. Peters was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, while Alexander was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television.  Impact  ABC began discussing the possibility of Disney producing more musical films for the network shortly after Cinderella's premiere, originally commissioning its producers to develop similar musicals to broadcast every November. Bill Carter of The New York Times predicted that the success of the broadcast \\"will mean more musicals for television, probably as early as\\" 1998. Similarly, Bert Fink of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization said that the program's ratings will most likely \\"have a salubrious effect on\\" the future of television musicals. Hirschhorn interpreted the film's success as an indication that \\"there is a huge family audience out there for quality programming,\\" expressing interest in eventually \\"fill[ing] in the ground between feature animated musicals and Broadway\\". Cinderella's producers immediately began researching other musical projects to adapt for the Wonderful World of Disney, with the network originally hoping to produce at least one similar television special per year, announcing that songwriter Stephen Schwartz had already begun writing a musical adaptation of Pinocchio. In his book The Cambridge Companion to the Musical, author Nicholas Everett identified Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella among important television musicals that \\"renewed interest in the genre\\" during the 1990s, with Playbill recognizing it as \\"the resurgence of televised movie musicals\\". According to Zadan, Cinderella's success \\"helped secure a future for musicals in the 'Wonderful World of Disney' slot\\", whose film company Storyline Entertainment started developing new musicals for the series shortly afterward, including Annie (1999). Although the stage musical Annie had already been adapted as a film in 1982, the film was considered to be a critical and commercial failure. Inspired by the success of Cinderella, Zadan and Meron saw remaking the musical as an opportunity to rectify the previous adaptation's errors. They enlisted Cinderella's choreographer Rob Marshall to direct and making the orphans ethnically diverse. According to Vulture.com entertainment critic Matt Zoller Seitz, both productions \\"stood out for their lush production values, expert control of tone, and ahead-of-the-curve commitment to diverse casting.\\" However, the Los Angeles Times' Brian Lowry observed that few of the series' subsequent projects achieved the ratings that Cinderella had, with viewership for later programming being rather inconsistent. Following the success of the film, the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization and Disney discussed possibly adapting the production into a touring stage musical by 2001, but the idea never materialized. Various elements from Freedman's script were incorporated into the 2000 national tour of Cinderella, which is considered to be the first time the musical was adapted into a legitimate Broadway-style production. A Broadway adaptation of the musical premiered in 2013, in which several songs from the 1997 film are re-used, including \\"There's Music in You\\". Additionally, Montalban has reprised his role as the prince in both regional and touring productions of Cinderella, some of which have been directly based on or inspired by the 1997 film. Cinderella has become widely revered as one of the best film adaptations of the fairy tale. The Daily Telegraph deemed the 1997 adaptation \\"The final of the trio of classic Cinderella remakes\\". Entertainment Tonight ranked the film the third greatest adaptation of the fairy tale. Highlighting the performances of Montalb√°n, Peters and Houston, Entertainment Weekly ranked Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella the fourth greatest adaptation of the fairy tale, ahead of both the 1965 (10th) and 1957 (sixth) versions, with author Mary Sollosi calling it one of \\"the 11 best-known film adaptations of the tale\\". In 2017, Shondaland.com crowned the film \\"one of the most inclusive, expensive ... and ultimately beloved TV movies of all time.\\" Kelsie Gibson of PopSugar wrote that the film is superior to Disney's other princess-themed offerings from the 1990s.  Cultural significance  Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is considered to be a \\"groundbreaking\\" film due to its diverse cast, particularly casting a black actress as Cinderella. A BET biographer referred to the production as a \\"phenomenon\\" whose cast \\"broke new ground.\\" Following its success, Disney considered adapting the fairy tale \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" into a musical set in Spain featuring Latin music, but the idea never materialized. Brandy is considered to be the first African-American to play Cinderella on-screen. Newsweek opined that Brandy's casting proved that \\"the idea of a black girl playing the classic Cinderella was [not] unthinkable\\", calling it \\"especially significant because\\" Disney's 1950 film \\"sent a painful message that only white women could be princesses.\\" Brandy's performance earned her the titles \\"the first Cinderella of color\\", \\"the first black Cinderella\\" and \\"the first African-American princess\\" by various media publications, while Shondaland.com contributor Kendra James dubbed Brandy \\"Disney's first black princess\\", crediting her with proving that \\"Cinderella could have microbraids\\" and crowning her the Cinderella of the 1990s. James concluded, \\"for a generation of young children of color, 'Cinderella' became an iconic memory of their childhoods, of seeing themselves in a black princess who could lock eyes and fall in love with a Filipino prince.\\" Similar to the film, the stage adaptation has consistently demonstrated color-blind casting. In 2014, actress Keke Palmer was cast as Cinderella on Broadway, becoming the first black actress to play the role on Broadway. Identifying Brandy as one of her inspirations for the role, Palmer explained, \\"I feel like the reason I'm able to do this is definitely because Brandy did it on TV\\". According to Ruthie Fierberg of Playbill, Brandy's performance \\"immortalized the role on screen\\", while Hollywood.com's Jeremy Rodriguez ranked her seventh out of \\"10 Actresses Who Played Cinderella Like Royalty\\", praising her for introducing \\"a more independent version of the classic character.\\" Fuse TV dubbed Brandy's performance as Cinderella \\"iconic\\" and \\"arguably the most groundbreaking portrayal at time,\\" inspiring the character to become more diverse in the following years. Essence's Deena Campbell credited the singer with \\"inspiring other young girls to be Black Cinderellas\\". Media criticism professor Venise Berry found Brandy's casting and performance to be a \\"wonderful opportunity to reflect the true diversity in our society\\", writing, \\"I think that Brandy will help African-American females see there are other possibilities that their lives can blossom into something good, and you don't have to be white for that to happen,\\" in turn making the classic story more accessible \\"to little black girls\\" who had believed that ascending into a life of privilege was only possible for white people. Writing for Nylon, Taylor Bryant called the film both \\"An Underrated Classic\\" and \\"One of the most important moments in [film] history\\". Applauding the film for providing minorities with \\"the chance to see themselves depicted as royalty for perhaps the first time\\", Bryant identified Brandy as a princess for black girls to \\"fawn\\" over, which Disney would not revisit until The Princess and the Frog (2009). Similarly, Martha Tesema wrote in an article for Mashable that \\"seeing Brandy as Cinderella on screen was groundbreaking\\" having \\"grown up in a time where future Disney characters like Tiana did not exist and the reason why didn't cross my mind‚Äîuntil this Cinderella. Seeing a princess with box braids like mine and a fairy godmother like Whitney ... gave me and girls who looked like me a glimpse at an early age of why it is necessary to demand representation of all types of people playing all times of roles in films.\\" Ashley Rey, a writer for Bustle, opined that the film \\"helped show the world that black and brown faces should have just as much of a presence in fairytale land as white faces do.\\" Martha Tesema, a writer for Mashable, called the film \\"the best live-action princess remake\\", writing that it \\"deserves just as much praise now as it did then.\\" Tesema credits its ethnic diversity with making the film as \\"enchanting\\" as it is, continuing that the production \\"invites you to accept these [characters' races] as just the way they are for a little over an hour and it's a beautiful phenomenon\\". Furthermore, the writer opined that future live-action remakes should watch Cinderella for reference. In an article for HuffPost, contributor Isabelle Khoo argued that despite the constant remakes that Hollywood produces \\"no fairy tale adaptation has been more important than Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Cinderella.'\\", citing its diverse cast, combating of sexist stereotypes often depicted in other Disney films, and empowering themes that encourage children to make their own dreams come true as opposed to simply \\"keep on believing\\" among \\"three important reasons the 1997 version has maintained relevance today.\\" Khoo observed that the film continues to be constantly praised in social media by fans who had grown up with the film for its diversity, concluding, \\"With so much talk about the lack of diversity in Hollywood these days, Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Cinderella' is a shining example of the diversity we need.\\" Similarly, Elle writer R. Eric Thomas crowned Cinderella \\"One of the Most Important Movies of the '90s\\". Describing it as \\"effortlessly, even unintentionally, progressive\\", Thomas wrote that the film \\"forecast a world with far more possibility; it's a film made for the future.\\" Crediting the film with establishing both Brandy and Houston as \\"icons\\", the writer concluded that Cinderella teaches \\"about the limitless nature of storytelling. That in stories, there are no constraints; the only limit is your imagination. And once you learn that, you don't unlearn it\\", representing its theme that nothing is impossible. Mandy Len Catron, author of How to Fall in Love with Anyone: A Memoir in Essays, believes that the film remains \\"The only truly diverse version of the fairy tale\\" as of 2017. In 2019, Rob Marshall, the film's choreographer, announced that Halle Bailey, an African-American R&B; singer, would play Princess Ariel for his live action/CGI adaptation of The Little Mermaid. The following year, when Brandy was asked if she had any advice for Bailey, she said, \\"I think she needs to understand that she has everything that it takes to do everything that she's meant to do. I think that she needs to keep positive people around her and to also stay positive and to not live her life for anyone but herself. And I mean that in a way where sometimes in this industry, we can get caught up in what everybody thinks that we should do. But she should stay true to herself. I believe that her staying true to herself is the reason why she's in a great position to do all of the things that she's meant to do. And I think that she's such a positive role model already. So I just wish her all the best. I absolutely love Halle and I love Chloe. I see so much of myself in Halle. Oh my God.\\" See also *Cinderella, Rodgers and Hammerstein's original 1957 television musical on which the film is based, starring Julie Andrews in the title role *Cinderella, Disney's 1950 animated musical adaption of the fairy tale *Cindy, ABC's 1978 re-imagining of the Cinderella fairy tale featuring an all-black cast ReferencesExternal links * Category:1997 television films Category:1997 films Category:1997 fantasy films Category:1997 musical films Category:1990s romance films Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:American musical fantasy films Category:American romantic fantasy films Category:Disney television films Category:1990s feminist films Category:Films about weddings Category:Films based on Charles Perrault's Cinderella Category:Films directed by Robert Iscove Category:Films shot in Los Angeles County Category:Musical film remakes Category:Musical television films Category:Musicals by Rodgers and Hammerstein Category:Television remakes of films Category:Films based on musicals Category:Films based on Cinderella ","title":"Cinderella (1997 film)"},{"id":"29116226","text":"The Linograph Company Building, also known as the Englehart Manufacturing Company Building and RiverWalk Lofts , is a historic building located in downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States.

History The Linograph Company Building was designed by two prominent Davenport architects. The original building was the work of the architectural firm of Clausen & Kruse. The 1949 addition was the work of Arthur Ebeling. The building was an industrial facility for the company, which made typesetting machines, or the Linograph. The machines were distributed internationally, as well as across the country, and they \\"contributed significantly to the advancement of the typesetting process.\\" with The company occupied the building until 1944 when it was sold to a competitor, Intertype Corporation and Englehart Manufacturing Co. In 1954 The Salvation Army acquired the building, and used it for a variety of purposes, including an Adult Rehabilitation Center, which relocated in 2004. MetroPlains Development of St. Paul, Minnesota bought the building in July 2007, and started converting the building into loft apartments in October of the same year. The $8 million project was completed in 2009. Architecture The building is a four-story, rectangular structure built of concrete on a raised concrete foundation. Extensions were added to the east of the original structure, which altered the building's main entrance. Some of the windows were filled in over the years, but large windows were placed in the building's fenestration during the 2009 renovation. A loading dock on the south side of the building was covered over at some point.

Maguire batted and threw right-handed. She also played under the name of Dorothy Chapman. Career summary An All-Star catcher, Dorothy Maguire was one of the sixty original members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. While only a modest hitter at the plate, Maguire displayed considerable skill in handling pitchers and an ability to understand the strategy of the game. She achieved a playoff berth in six of her seven seasons in the league, including the championship teams in 1943 and 1945, though she played with three different teams based in four different cities, because the league shifted players as needed to help teams stay afloat. Her life was full of energy, excitement, and risks unfamiliar to many women through the years, as she worked in cabbage fields during the Great Depression, raised horses, worked in factories, and drove taxi cabs in Cleveland during World War II. She was dubbed Mickey after Detroit Tigers catcher Mickey Cochrane, due to her tenacity to accomplish any task she set out to do and her amazingly warm-hearted spirit. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was introduced in the spring of 1943, featuring young women with both athletic ability and feminine appeal. During World War II, Philip K. Wrigley was in charge both of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club. Wrigley decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. Arthur Meyerhoff, Wrigley's advertising director, was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities, as well as a projected budget was developed. Hundreds of girls were eager to play in the new league, and 280 were invited to final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Of those, sixty were selected as the first women to play on the first four teams: the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team had fifteen players, a manager, a business manager and a female chaperone. Players in the AAGBBL made between $50 and $125 a week during a three-month, 108-game season, which were generous in comparison to those for other work at the time. The average full-time worker made $1,299 a year in the 1940s, according to one estimate, or about $25 a week. Most AAGPBL games were played at night, including the All-Star game of the inaugural season on July 1, 1943, which also was the first contest played under artificial illumination at Wrigley Field in Chicago.SABR Project ‚Äî Doris Sams biography by Jim Sargent The league made an auspicious debut, averaging about 1,000 fans per game in 1943, while attracting about 210,000 for the entire year. Early in the 1944 season, it became evident that the war would not force major league baseball to disband, and Wrigley lost interest in the project. During the offseason, Wrigley sold the league to his Chicago advertising executive, Arthur Meyerhoff. It was under Meyerhoff management that expansion and the publicity campaign of the AAGPBL reached its peak. The circuit excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans, but by 1954, attendance dropped to only 270,000, dooming the league to extinction. It was a neglected chapter of sports history, at least until 1992, when filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her film A League of Their Own, a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL that brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league.Absolute Michigan ‚Äì Michigan History: Sluggers in Skirts Maguire was born Dorothy Maime McAlpin in LaGrange, Ohio, and grew up playing sandlot ball with her neighborhood kids at an early age, most of them boys, but did not start participating organized baseball until she was 16. At this time, a tool shop in Elyria, Ohio made special arrangements to work around child labor rules so that she could play with them. She then joined the Erin Brew, a perennial champion fastpitch team based in Cleveland, where she was discovered by an AAGPBL scout. She was invited to assist to final tryouts at Wrigley Field. Following a week and a half of drills, she was allocated to the Racine Belles, a team managed by hockey legend Johnny Gottselig. Maguire enjoyed a good first season. She shared catching duties with Irene Hickson, while the Belles claimed the first Championship Title in the league's history. Racine was characterized by strong pitching, solid defense, timely hitting and speed on the bases. Mary Nesbitt posted a 26‚Äì13 record in the regular season, while Joanne Winter finished with an 11‚Äì11 mark to give Racine a strong one-two pitching staff. The offensive was led by Eleanor Dapkus, who hit a league-lead 10 home runs. The speedy Sophie Kurys stole a league-best 44 bases and scored 60 runs, while Margaret Danhauser, Maddy English, Edythe Perlick and Claire Schillace could be counted on for their bats and solid defense. In the Championship Series, the Belles defeated the Comets, winners of the second half, 3 games to 0. Maguire hit .269 in 70 games, driving in 33 runs while scoring 34 times. She also appeared in the All-Star game during the midseason, which was played between two teams composed of Belles and Comets players against Blue Sox and Peaches players. Two new teams joined the league in 1944, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes. Maguire started the season with the expansion Chicks as their regular catcher, appearing in 109 of the 117 games of her team. She married Tom Maguire, who was reported killed in action during wartime in the month of June. Maguire received a call just before a game from her Mother, but kept the news to herself and entered the field of play. After completing the game, she reported the news to the press. Then, she received a couple of letters from him in August from a hospital in Italy, explaining that he had not been identified for that time and was presumed dead. This event provided partial inspiration for the character of catcher Dottie Hinson, portrayed by actress Geena Davis in the film A League of Their Own. That season, Maguire dropped to .191 with 40 runs and 39 RBI, but her biggest strength was the ability to handle pitchers and call the game, while showing a solid defense and a strong throwing arm. The Chicks were a well balanced squad that counted with talented pitchers as Josephine Kabick (26-19) and Connie Wisniewski (23-10). The offensive support came from Merle Keagle, who led the AAGPBL hitters with seven home runs and 145 total bases, while hitting .264 with 47 RBI. A daring base runner, Alma Ziegler established at second base as a flashy defender who made outstandings plays routinely, being considered the spark plug of the team. With Max Carey at the helm, the Chicks went 30‚Äì26 in the first half of the year, but dominated the second half (40-19) and had the best overall record (70-45). They then went on to win the Championship Title, beating Kenosha in seven playoff games. Although the Chicks won the title, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. In fact, the Chicks were forced to play all seven games of the series at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium because the Brewers were using the Borchert Field in Milwaukee. In addition, the high ticket prices charged for AAGPBL games failed to encourage significant fan support. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the Chicks moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season. Two teams were added in the AAGPBL's 110-game 1945 regular season, the Fort Wayne Daisies and the Grand Rapids Chicks. Maguire continued her stellar play with the Chicks at Grand Rapids, helping her team to reach the playoffs. She also contributed with a .159 average in 99 games, driving in 20 runs while scoring 35 times. The Chicks finished third with a 60‚Äì50 record, but lost in the first round to Rockford, three to one games. In 1946 the AAGPBL acquired franchises for two more teams, the Muskegon Lassies and the Peoria Redwings. A four-team minor league also was established in Chicago as the Chicago Girls Baseball League (CGBL), while the spring training camp was moved to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Maguire was dealt to the Lassies in order to establish the new team, which was managed by Buzz Boyle. She posted career-numbers in hits (74), runs (42) and RBI (47), while hitting a .218 average in 101 games, a pretty good performance considering Muskegon finished sixth the eight-team league with a losing record of 46‚Äì66.1946 Muskegon Lassies In April 1947, all of the league's players were flown to Havana, Cuba, for spring training. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in Havana because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. City ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games in Havana than did the Dodgers. Maguire saw little action with the Lassies that year, but still to manage a .216 average with 28 runs and 24 RBI in just 75 games due to an injury. Muskegon improved considerably under new manager, Bill Wambsganss, to win a close pennant race with a fine 69‚Äì43 record, backed by a strong performance from outfielder/pitcher Doris Sams, who hit a third-best .280 average with 31 runs and 41 RBI in 107 games, and posted an 11‚Äì4 pitching record with a respectable 0.93 earned run average, to finish second only to Grand Rapids' Mildred Earp (.068). Sams was named Player of the Year, but Muskegon fell in the first round of the playoffs, dropping 3 of 4 games to Racine.1947 Muskegon Lassies All-American Girls Professional Baseball League ‚Äì Photo Gallery For the 1948 season, the AAGPBL expanded to a historical peak of ten teams divided into Eastern and Western Divisions. That year, Maguire returned in good form, playing all but one game for her team. She hit a career-low .155 (58-for-373) with 58 runs and 30 RBI in 124 games, but recorded career-numbers in at-bats and game appearances. Muskegon remained strong, finishing 67‚Äì58 for the second-best record in the eastern division, but fell in the first round of the playoffs to Grand Rapids by a 3‚Äì1 margin.Leave It to the Girls: Excerpt from the 1948 Muskegon Lassies Year Book, by Prudie M. Bretting Maguire was divorced in 1947. After married George Chapman in 1949, she decided to retire at the end of the season. Used sparingly, she hit .148 in only 17 games. Muskegon, now managed by Carson Bigbee, fell back to sixth place (46-66) in the eight-team league, but won a wild card playoff berth. The Lassies took the first round from Kenosha, two to zero games, but were swept in the next round by Grand Rapids in three games.1949 Muskegon Lassies After baseball Following her baseball career, Mickey raised six children from 1950 to 1959 with husband George but became a single mother in 1963. According to author Dan Gutman, Dorothy and George Chapman's son Rick Chapman tried out for the Kansas City Royals in 1970. She also entered into horse training as a hobby, to become a distinguished horsewoman at a high level. In the 1960s, she was well known for her championships in the Central Ohio Saddle Club Association with Chico's Flame, one of the best Morgan horses. In many ways, she characterized the quality of athlete and the type of woman who helped make history, and her contributions will never not be forgotten. She died in Spencer, Ohio, at the age of 62. Dorothy McAlpin Maguire Chapman was inducted into the Ohio Hall of Fame in 2010. She also is part of Women in Baseball, the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, which was inaugurated on November 5, in honor of the entire league rather than individual baseball personalities. Since then, the Hall of Fame has organized a series of special programs and events to honor the historic role of women in baseball. In 2006, the Mother's Day slate was highlighted by the unveiling of an outdoor statue paying tribute to the legacy of the AAGPBL. In total, over 50 women baseball figures attended the event, including former AAGPBL members and younger players as Ila Borders and Julie Croteau. The Statue, named At Bat, was created by sculptor Stanley Bleifeld from a picture of Mickey taking her batting stance. The commemorative outdoor sculpture is located in what is known as Cooper Park, just a few yards away from a pair of existing statues that honor the Brooklyn Dodgers' 1955 World Series championship.MLB.com ‚Äì Mother's Day at baseball mecca: Women in baseball to be celebrated this Sunday in Cooperstown Career statistics Batting { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!AB!!R!!H!!2B!!3B!!HR!!RBI!!SB!!BB!!SO!!BA!!OBP!!SLG -align=center  595  1906  222  370  30  16  3  185  243  206  149  .194  .273  .231 } Fielding { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"9\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!PO!!A!!E!!TC!!DP!!FA -align=center  574  1922  525  190  2637  56  .928 } All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

He was also the owner of Premier League football club Leicester City from 2010 until his death in a helicopter crash at the King Power Stadium in Leicester.  Career  Vichai was the founder and CEO of King Power Duty Free, an operator of duty-free shops. In December 2009, King Power received the royal warrant from King Bhumibol of Thailand in a ceremony attended by Vichai. He was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 5th richest man in Thailand, reportedly worth US$4.9 billion, as of 28 October 2018. The first football match Vichai watched in England was the 1997 League Cup Final between Leicester City and Middlesbrough, which may have attracted him to the club. In August 2010, the Asia Football Investments consortium including Vichai and his son Aiyawatt purchased English Football League Championship club Leicester City. He succeeded Milan Mandariƒá as chairman of the club in February 2011 while continuing as owner, and Aiyawatt became the vice chairman. In July 2011, the club's formerly named Walkers Stadium was renamed the King Power Stadium. Leicester City went on to win the 2015‚Äì16 Premier League title after starting the season as 5000/1 rank outsiders. Shortly before the 2016‚Äì17 season, Vichai gifted 19 players a BMW i8‚Äîat ¬£100,000 each‚Äîas a gift for winning the title. In May 2017, he bought his second football club, OH Leuven in Belgium.  Personal life  Vichai was born into a Thai Chinese family. His father, Wiwat Raksriaksorn (Chinese name: Buy Li Meng; ) immigrated to Thailand from Fujian, China.https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/v-vichai-how-leicester-citys-thai-owner- became-billionaire-blessing-prayer-1554828 Vichai was married to Aimon Srivaddhanaprabha, with whom he had four children: Voramas, Apichet, Aroonroong, and Aiyawatt. In 2012, the King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej bestowed the family the new surname of Srivaddhanaprabha, which means \\"light of progressive glory\\". He was awarded an honorary doctorate as a Doctor of Laws by the University of Leicester in 2016. As a young man, Vichai had studied in Taiwan and the United States. In his spare time Vichai was an avid polo player, and owned the VR Polo Club in Bangkok. He was the president of Ham Polo Club in London from 2008 to 2012. Vichai believed that Leicester City F.C.'s success or failure was affected by karma, and he therefore endeavoured to build Buddhist temples and support Buddhist monks to accumulate good karma. Vichai had a good relationship with the Thai monk and his fellow monks, who often blessed the team players, either in England or at the monks' home temple in Thailand, Wat Traimit. The monks flying in to see the players of the team became a common sight. In 2015, Aiyawatt became ordained as a Buddhist monk for a month. In April 2019, The Asian Awards honoured him with the Outstanding Contribution to the Community Award.  Death  On 27 October 2018, Vichai's AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter crashed outside the King Power Stadium shortly after taking off from the pitch. Eyewitnesses described seeing the helicopter spinning before crashing and creating a fireball. The next day, it was confirmed that Vichai--along with the other two passengers and the pilots--had died in the crash. Numerous tributes were laid to Vichai outside the King Power Stadium by players along with fans of Leicester City and other football clubs. In accordance with Thai burial customs, Vichai's funeral lasted for eight days, beginning on 3 November.

St. Lola) is a two-person band based in Nashville, Tennessee. Band members include singer/songwriter/musician/author, Cindy Morgan Brouwer, and songwriter/producer/engineer/musician, Jeremy Bose. St. Lola was birthed out of the need for both artists to have a venue to release their own penned songs that may have been viewed as having little commercial potential for other artists. The band members have together written over 20 number one songs, and have written songs for other artists, including Uncle Kracker and Clay Aiken, among others. Morgan and Bose have collaborated on songwriting for over a decade and began work on St. Lola's first EP, Little Breaks/Little Bends, in 2007. The EP, released in 2008, contains the following tracks: #Sunny #Happy #He‚Äôs In Love #Don‚Äôt Say #Oil and Water #Fix The duo‚Äôs first full-length album, High Atop the Houses and the Towns, was released October 5, 2010. Containing 11 tracks in total, all tracks from their original EP were included on the full-length recording, except for the tracks Happy and Oil and Water. The group's first full-length album has a sound that may be described as piano based alternative pop with a moody electro ambiance to it. Virtually all songs on the album deal with relationships and people, some with a positive outlook and several with a more somber view. The album's first single, \\"Hold Me\\", was featured on an episode of Pretty Little Liars, airing on ABC Family. The B-side of the single, \\"Don't Say\\", had previously been aired on the television series One Tree Hill, on The WB Television Network. The band is currently on the Nettwerk Records label. Brouwer, who has sold millions of albums as a Contemporary Christian Music artist, continues to release music in the CCM genre as a solo artist under the name of Cindy Morgan (her maiden name).

ARPA was launched in the 1970s after the Antiquities Act of 1906 was declared ‚Äúunconstitutionally vague‚Äù. The Antiquities Act was unable to protect historical sites from criminal looting. Several attempts by the federal land- managing agencies and prosecutors to use this act resulted in judges saying that it was unconstitutionally vague making it unenforceable.(Harmon 172) ARPA regulates access to archaeological resources on federal and Indian lands. Uniform regulations were issued by the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Department of Defense. Archaeological resources are defined as \\"Any material remains of human life or activities which are at least 100 years of age, and which are archaeological interest.\\"(King 252) Also defined is \\"Of archaeological interest\\" which is \\"Capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaption, and related topics.\\"(King 252) ARPA forbids anyone from excavating or removing archaeological resources from federal or Indian land without a permit from a land managing agency.

The building was built as a Congregational Church. History The Congregational Church established a congregation in Davenport in 1839 as First Congregational Church and in 1861 it was reorganized as Edward's Congregational Church. The denomination was never large or broad-based in the city and was supported in part by the American Home Mission Society. In 1857 the German Congregational Church was founded with a handful of members. They merged with Bethlehem Congregational Mission in 1909 and formed Berea Congregational Church. Berea was the congregation that built this structure. In 1964 Berea merged with Sunnymead Evangelical and Reformed Church and became Faith United Church of Christ. They occupied the Sunnymead facility in northwest Davenport. This building became First Bible Missionary Church, and it has changed congregations since. It has always housed small Protestant congregations. Architecture The church building is constructed of brick on a rock-faced stone basement. The structure was designed in no clearly definable architectural style. with It is a cross- gabled building with a tower in the angle on the east side. The exterior bricks are painted white, and the primary ornamentation of the building are narrow, molded stringcourses and its stained glass windows. It is defined more by its plain surface areas and clean, sharp lines. Also of note are the variety of window shapes employed on the building. Other features include short cornice returns, a pedimented roof dormer and palladian-like arrangement of the windows on the east side, all of which suggests Neoclassicism that was popular at the turn of the 20th-century.

He currently resides in Jamestown, Rhode Island. Education and early career Housberg received his Bachelor of Fine Arts (1975) and Master of Fine Arts (1979) degrees from Rhode Island School of DesignRISD Views Fall 2005 Page 18 where he has also served as an instructor at various times during 1978-1997. While he was at RISD, Housberg studied glass under artist Dale Chihuly and in 1972, a year after it was founded, he studied at the Pilchuck Glass School in Stanwood, Washington. Early in his career, Housberg studied painting, but was drawn to glass for its atmospheric color. He began working in stained glass but eventually moved to work in kiln formed glass as an alternative to the lead structure of traditional stained glass. After his graduate work at RISD, he studied in England with Patrick Reyntiens, a pioneer in contemporary stained glass and the author of The Technique of Stained Glass. This experience was made possible by a scholarship he received from the New York Experimental Glass Workshop, now known as Urban Glass in Brooklyn, New York. In 1986, as a Fulbright Scholar, Housberg worked at the International Center for Glass Research (CIRVA) in Marseille, France. He spent his time exploring various glass techniques such as fusing, slumping, and kiln-casting. This endeavor was supported in part by a donation of glass from Bullseye Glass in Portland, Oregon, a pioneer in the manufacturing of fusible glass. Work Housberg is noted for his inventive applications of glassworking technologies in architectural settings. Central to his work are the tactile qualities of glass and the expression of its materiality. Although Housberg continues to explore and implement multiple techniques in his work, he is best known for his architectural installations consisting of colorful kilnformed tiles with a sawtooth relief. Housberg's work was profiled in the multimedia documentary series, NetWorks Rhode Island, in 2016. Architectural installations Housberg‚Äôs first large architectural commission was in 1990 from The Dreyfus Corporation for the MetLife Building in New York City. This work was done with the architecture firm Swanke Hayden Connell Ltd. of New York and incorporated cast glass fabricated in conjunction with Fenton Art Glass. The 8'h x 21'w wall is of Dreyfus's iconic lion, standing in tall grass. His second major commission was in 1993 for Pfizer Inc in Groton, CT where he worked with the architectural firm CUH2A Inc., Princeton, NJ. The work was for four 12‚Äôh x 11‚Äôw walls, each depicting a season. Four Seasons is made of cast and laminated glass.

This 14‚Äôh x 40‚Äôw work was commissioned by the U.S. General Services Administration Art in Architecture Program. In 2001, Housberg completed his first installation to use his signature sawtooth glass tiles. The 12‚Äôh x 9‚Äôw backlit, kilnformed glass wall is in the lobby of The Peninsula Chicago.

Plot  Kurogane Taito is a freshman in Miyasaka High. Ever since an injury to his leg (a snapped tendon) that prevented him from practicing karate, which he had excelled in since elementary school, he has always believed that he was an ordinary, regular guy. However, due to a promise exchanged with a beautiful Vampire (Most Ancient Sorcerer) Saitohimea nine years ago which he has forgotten about, he is in fact no longer ordinary. Nine years ago, Saitohimea injected him with a poison, which prevents him from dying as long as he doesn't die seven times within fifteen minutes. Shortly after his change, a boy named Kurenai Hinata attacked them with a demon and killed Taito six times in rapid succession. In order to prevent him from killing Taito outright, Saitohimea agreed to leave with Hinata and allow Taito's memory to be wiped. Subsequent to this, Saitohimea was experimented on and imprisoned in a dimension with no sound or light whatsoever, and Taito continued with his life as a normal human. Taito has recently been having a recurring dream concerning Saitohimea, although he is unable to remember her name. After saving Andou Mirai from being hit by a truck he is himself killed, however due to his conditional immortality, he survives. After his body picks up and reattaches his head, he begins to remember more details about Saitohimea and eventually recalls her name, which allows Saitohimea to regain her powers and escape from her prison. By this point, Taito has realized that not only are his most recent injuries healed, but his previous leg injury is also healed. He is attacked by the Church but is able to survive and he makes his way to the playground where he and Saitohimea met previously, where they are reunited. Along with unlikely allies, Kurenai Gekkou, Miyasaka High's student council president and genius who is bent on avenging his parents as well as Andou Mirai, Gekkou's cute lightning demon familiar, Taito and Saitohimea have to contend against Gekkou's younger twin brother, Kurenai Hinata, who seeks to resurrect the powerful Vampire (Most Ancient Sorcerer) Bahlskra. Unknown to them, their destinies were already woven and foretold in an ancient prophecy of epic proportions.  Characters  ; : :A light-blue hair 16-year-old freshman of Miyasaka High, the protagonist of the story, Kurogane Taito used to excel in karate when he was young, but later had to give it up due to a leg injury. Since then, he had believed himself to be an ordinary, regular guy. However, his memories of an event nine years ago were sealed up, during which he had made a contract with the beautiful Saitohimea and acquired an extraordinary ability which grants him a conditional form of immortality. At the start of the story, he manages to regain those memories after a certain incident and goes on to reunite with Saitohimea. He later acquires further powers and swears to protect Saitohimea from the Tenma (Â§©È≠î). One of the powers he acquires is a familiar in the form of a cat, this familiar, called Nyankichi, required a certain amount of blood to be summoned which was impossible for a normal human to give without dying. The familiar enabled him to cast spells which allowed him to see in the dark as well as a magic which curses other magic, therefore sealing them. While Tenma is normally translated as evil spirit or demon, in the story, it is a special existence different from the conventional evil spirit. He gradually remembers the feelings he had for Saitohimea and realizes he is falling in love with her as she is with him. ; / : :Excluding the sealed up Bahlskra, Saitohimea is the last of the Vampires. In the story, 'Vampire' is used as the furigana reading of 'Most Ancient Sorcerer' (ÊúÄÂè§„ÅÆÈ≠îË°ìÂ∏´). Saitohimea is described to have mischievous crimson eyes, pink lips, and lavender colored hair which ends in a spectrum of colors. Since she was born, everyone around her has sought and hunted her for her powers, except for Taito, whom she fell in love with and subsequently formed a contract with. In order to revive the dead Taito, she exchanged most of her powers in order to revive him, but still retains a large amount compared to humans. She later joins Miyasaka High as a student, and together with Taito, becomes part of Gekkou's student council and takes on the name of Himea Saito. ; : :Kurenai Gekkou, a freshman and also the student council president of Miyasaka High, is a self-proclaimed genius. Nine years ago before the starting tumeframe of the story, due to a certain deed committed by his younger twin brother, Hinata, Gekkou was prompted to constantly seek out power, initially driven by the fear for his life, and later motivated by the prospects of revenge. Gekkou is demonstrated to be quick-witted and highly intelligent. He wields an ancient fencing-like sword known as Spell Error, and is trained in several traditional arts of exorcism. As the student council president, he has made a contract with the lightning demon Mirai and is tasked to be the guardian of the Holy Ground (ËÅñÂú∞)( a location with certain special properties over which Miyasaka High was built). He claims Mirai as his property and is very possessive over her. His superiority complex is often shown by his self proclamation of Genius, and belief that he is stronger than his brother. ; : :Also a student of Miyasaka High despite her age, Mirai is a lightning demon that takes on the form of a cute, 14-year-old bish≈çjo. Initially tasked to kill Gekkou, she later went on to form a contract with him as she became unable to release her powers without his consent. While she is considered to be an upper-class demon of noble blood, most of her powers are usually sealed away by Gekkou and can only be re-activated with his permission, upon which her hair will turn golden and her body will be wrapped in a vortex of lightning. She is described to be excessively boisterous and annoying to Gekkou, though on the flip side, she is often irritated by Gekkou's apparent indifference to her existence. Her favorite pastime is reading manga and drawing, whilst her favourite drink is Dr. Cinnamon. ; : :A girl with medium length hair, Haruka is the classmate and childhood friend of Taito. She carries romantic feelings for Taito. Her role is revealed to be of an observer later in the story, though she only knows this when her other personality is in control. Her other personality lacks emotion compared to her counterpart and is aware of the events around her. ; : :Younger identical twin brother of Gekkou. Described to be cold and emotionless, he sees all other humans, including his own brother, as inferior to himself. He wields several powers, including the ability to summon different contracted demons and dimensional beings to do his bidding. Hinata wants to capture Saitohimea for a particular reason. ; : :A powerful sealed up Vampire (Most Ancient Sorcerer) at the start of the story. He has deep ties to Saitohimea. It is later revealed that Bahlskra is an alternate personality. Saitohimea created him to fend off her loneliness, and by defeating Bahlskra was the first part of a certain magic called Bliss completed. ; : :A delinquent of Miyasaka High. Due to the fact that her memory of a demon attack in school was not erased, she decided to become the secretary of Gekkou's student council, much to his discontent. She has a friendly rivalry with Gekkou. ; : :A powerful half-elf spell breaker from the world of elves. His power is oriented towards seals and barrier construction. Serge has golden hair and deep blue eyes and possesses a friendly disposition. The desire to save their mother from the wounds and damages incurred from the Church's experiments prompted him and Hasga to join Gekkou's student council in the human world, after they have helped rescue their mother, Ela of the East. He was influenced by Taito, causing him to seal his mother rather than destroy her, against his original intentions and her pleas. ; : :A powerful half-elf spell breaker from the world of elves. His power is oriented towards destruction which also includes seals and barriers and magic. The younger brother of Serge, Hasga has deep blue hair and golden eyes and possesses a temperament disposition. The desire to save their mother from the wounds and damages incurred from the Church's experiments prompted him and Serge to join Gekkou's student council in the human world, after they have helped rescue their mother, Ela of the East. ; :A young German girl of the Temperon Crowely group. She has silver hair tied up into twin tails, and is skilled in the Japanese sword and flame magic. She appears to have some ties to Gekkou. ; : :7th student council president of Miyasaka High who is currently an agent of the Military. Usually dressed in a suit with a red tie and wears gloves. He is a formidable opponent who is sent to supervise, build up the current student council, and keep them in check. It was due to him that Izumi was allowed to remain in the Student Council without erasing her memory. His ability is strong enough to counter the weakened Saitohimea. He appears to have some ulterior motive. ; :Familiar of Taito from another dimension. His former name is . Taito got to him through a fragment of the fountain of knowledge acquired from Edeluka. In exchange for Taito's blood daily, he grants Taito two powers: Night vision and spell displacement. ; :Powerful female elf who is the mother of Serge and Hasga.

Because Moore's part in the film was so different from the roles she had become known for following Flaming Youth, there was an outcry against her. Forgotten was that, before her success in Flaming Youth, the vast majority of her roles had been dramatic in character, a few even tragic. She had not only played mothers, but mothers who had lost children (Broken Chains) and mothers who died (Dinty). Still, her performance generally was well received. The film, however, was not as big a success as her previous few comedies, and so Sally was lined up to follow So Big. Moore wrote in Silent Star that upon meeting Edna Ferber some years after the film, the author gave her approval of Moore's performance.

It was founded in 2004 by several foundations and shut down in 2013. The organization supported grantees and other non-governmental organizations in their efforts to collaborate, engage policy makers, and bring issues to the attention of the media. Its last President was Nancy Soderberg.\\"Biographical Information: Ambassador Nancy E. Soderberg\\", The Hill, 2010. History The Connect U.S. initiative was founded in 2004 by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Open Society Institute, and Rockefeller Brothers Fund to unite and support a growing number of U.S.-based organizations that work on international affairs. The Ford Foundation joined the collaborative in 2005, the Atlantic Philanthropies joined in 2008, the Ploughshares Fund joined in 2009, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York joined in 2010. The Connect U.S. Fund operated as a project of the Tides Center. The initiative had emerged from a series of meetings among the founding partners in 2002 and 2003 when they discovered that they faced similar challenges, such as \\"limited public and private resources for foreign policy advocacy, media focus on a narrowly defined security agenda, and the absence of informed and empowered constituencies on global issues to hold policy makers accountable\\". The foundations agreed that \\"a collaborative fund, to which each would contribute, might provide an important incentive to collaboration among NGOs, and thereby enhance the collective impact of advocacy efforts. They thus created the Connect U.S. Fund and embarked on two rounds of grantmaking, from 2004 through 2006.\\" In November 2006, Eric P. Schwartz joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its first executive director.U.S. State Department. \\"Biographical Information Eric P. Schwartz\\", 2009. He developed a program of grant-making and operations designed to promote a vision of responsible U.S. global engagement during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. In early 2009, Eric Schwartz left to join the U.S. State Department as the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration, and Ambassador Nancy Soderberg joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its new President. She served until it shut down in 2013. Overview  The Connect U.S. Fund was managed and administered by the Tides Center. The Connect U.S. Council provided policy and program guidance for the Connect U.S. initiative, and was composed of representatives from each of the supporting foundations. The Council was supported by the Connect U.S. Fund professional staff and operated as a project of the Tides Center. Through a program of grant-making and operations designed to foster stronger collaboration among non- governmental organizations active on foreign policy issues, the Connect U.S. Fund sought to advance a vision for responsible U.S. global engagement in an increasingly interdependent world. The Fund supported a community of foundations and non-governmental organizations working together to enhance the effectiveness of their collective advocacy efforts. Key issues In 2012, the Connect U.S. Fund was focusing on four key issues: * Human rights: Encourage strong American leadership in multilateral human rights instruments and institutions, including support for the work of the International Criminal Court; strengthening UN human rights mechanisms; securing ratification of at least one ‚Äúcore‚Äù human rights treaty; and a U.S. government structure to prevent genocide and respond to mass atrocities. * Climate change: Urge U.S. leadership in addressing the climate crisis through making smart investments at home and in the developing world and by promoting innovative solutions for reducing emissions. This includes eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies and galvanizing investment in adaptation, clean technology, and forest protection in the developing world. *Development: Support for international financial and trade reform as a means for global poverty alleviation, including U.S. support for international financial transparency, international financial institution reform, trade preference reform, and export-led growth in the developing world, ensuring U.S. civilian agencies have the funds, capacity, and knowledge needed to conduct development, stability operations, and diplomacy effectively in order to strike a better balance between the civilian and military responsibilities in these areas. * Security: U.S. support for arms control treaties, a fissile material cut-off, and efforts to secure vulnerable nuclear materials  References  Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Ireland Born about 1575 in Dublin, nothing is known of Quin's early life before he travelled to study law at the Jesuit University of Ingolstadt in Germany around 1590. Although Quin referred to his Dublin origins in his work, his Irish family cannot be identified. The Stuarts rewarded him with property in Ireland, but there is no direct evidence that he returned to his native country. Quin wrote in English, Latin, French, and Italian, a polyglot combination that was a hallmark of his output. He is one of the earliest modern Irish writers to have had original work printed in English and of this small group he is notable for producing several (albeit slim) volumes that included works of court poetry, history, biography and philosophy. Scotland Having, for unknown reasons moved to the Calvinist University of St Andrews in Scotland, in 1595 Quin was presented to James VI, who was charmed with his manner and his verse. He further recommended himself to the king's favour by giving him some poetic Anagrams of his own composition that were based on James's name in four languages. The good impression which Quin made was confirmed by his presenting the king, on New Year's Day 1596, with an oration about his title to the English throne, a subject that was increasingly controversial as Elizabeth I grew older and yet had no official heir. The political implications of his poetry led to Quin's appearances at court being tracked by the English agents of Sir Robert Cecil who was sent a copy of Quin's Anagrams in 1600.John Flood ed., The Works of Walter Quin: An Irishman at the Stuart Courts, Dublin, Four Courts Press, 2014. Because of this controversy, the Edinburgh printer, Robert Waldegrave, refused, to print a book on the subject which Quin prepared in February 1598. He was at the time reported to be \\"answering Spenser's book, whereat the king is offended\\".The reference is to the fourth book of Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, where the king's mother, Mary Queen of Scots, was denounced under the name of Duessa. Meanwhile, Quin had been taken into the service of James VI as tutor to his sons, and he gave proof of his loyalty by publishing, in 1600, Sertum Poeticum in honorem Jacobi SextiWalter Quin, Sertum Poeticum in honorem Jacobi Sexti serenissimi ac potentissimi Scotorum Regis. A Gualtero Quinno Dubliniensi contextum, Edinburgh, Robert Waldegrave, 1600. The volume consists of some of Quin's early anagrams on the king's name, with Latin odes and epigrams, and English sonnets, addressed to members of the royal family and the rescuers of James VI during the Gowrie Conspiracy. An extravagant sonnet on Sir William Alexander (afterwards Earl of Stirling) appeared in the first edition of the latter's Tragedie of Darius (1603). In 1604 Quin celebrated the marriage of Sir William with an epithalamium and two sonnets. England Quin migrated with king James to England in 1603 where he was employed as a music teacher in the household of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. As part of the prince's circle Quin contributed Italian verses \\"In lode del autore\\" to Thomas Coryat's Odcombian Banquet (1611). In common with many other poets of the time, he lamented his young patron's death; these elegies were printed in Joshua Sylvester's Lachrym√¶ Lachrymarum (1612).Two of these poems were reissued in Mausoleum, Edinburgh, Andro Hart, 1613. Quin subsequently became a tutor to Prince Charles. For Charles's use he compiled Corona Virtutum principe dignarum ex varijs Philosophorum, Historicorum, Oratorum, et Poetarum (1603), a neo-Stoic florelegium on virtue culled from the work of Justus Lipsius with accounts of the lives and virtues of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.Walter Quin, Corona Virtutum principe dignarum ex varijs Philosophorum, Historicorum, Oratorum, et Poetarum floribus contexta et concinnata, London, John Bill, 1613, 1617. This was reissued at Leyden in 1634, and appeared in Stephen de Melle's Syntagma Philosophicum, Paris, 1670, v. 336‚Äì481. In The Memorie of the most worthy and renowned Bernard Stuart, Lord D'Aubigni, renewed (1619), Quin produced a biography of Bernard Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny, a Franco- Scottish hero who he believed was unduly neglected despite his importance to military affairs in France, Italy, and England (where he had fought for Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth).Walter Quin, The Memorie of the most worthy and renowned Bernard Stuart, Lord D'Aubigni, renewed. Whereunto are added Wishes presented to the Prince at his Creation, London, George Purslow, 1619. In the preface, Quin states that he had collected materials in French for a prose life of his hero but they proved inadequate for his purpose so A Short Collection of the most Notable Places of Histories is appended, together with a series of poems addressed to Prince Charles. On Charles I's marriage to Henrietta Maria in 1625 Quin published In Nuptiis Principum incomparabilium, congratulatory verses in Latin, English, French, and Italian.Walter Quin, In Nuptiis Principum incomparabilium, Caroli Britannici Imperii Monarch√¶ ‚Ä¶ et Henriett√¶ Mari√¶ Gratulatio quadrilinguis, London, George Purslow, 1625. Appropriately, French poetry was to the fore for a French bride and Quin rejoiced in the union of the rose of England with the lily of France. Around this time he returned to historical biography with a French prose account of the memorable sayings of Henri IV, the new queen's father.Now London, British Library MS Royal 16 E XLI (manuscript). This was Quin's last extended work. Ten Latin lines signed \\"Walt. O‚ÄîQuin Armig.\\" are prefixed to Sir Thomas Herbert's Travels (1634). Quin died in London in 1640. Family Another son of Quin's, James (1621‚Äì1659), born in Middlesex, obtained a scholarship at Westminster, and was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1639. He graduated B.A. in 1642, and M.A. in 1646, and was elected a senior student. As an avowed royalist he was ejected from this position by the parliamentary visitors in 1648. Anthony √† Wood, who was acquainted with him, often heard him \\"sing with great admiration.\\" His voice was a bass, \\"the best in England, and he had great command of it ‚Ä¶ but he wanted skill, and could scarce sing in consort.\\" He contrived to obtain an introduction to Cromwell, who was so delighted with his musical talent that, \\"after liquoring him with sack,\\" he restored him to his place at Christ Church. But in 1651 he was reported to be insane and he died in October 1659 and was buried in the cathedral of Christ Church. James Quin contributed to the Oxford University collections of Latin verse issued on the return of the king from Scotland in 1641, and on the peace with the Dutch Republic in 1654.

Kray) is a 2010 Russian drama film directed by Alexei Uchitel. The film was nominated for the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was also selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards but it didn't make the final shortlist. Plot At the end of World War II, thousands of former Soviet POWs, repatriated from Germany, were sent to Siberia by Stalin, to be ‚Äòre- educated.‚Äô The Edge is set in one such labour camp, on the edge of a dense forest. Despite being a war hero, Ignat, a disgraced Red Army train engineer, is sent to the camp as punishment for destroying the fastest train in the Soviet Union during a reckless race. Upon arrival at the camp, Ignat quickly establishes a reputation for devotion to the labor camp's one railway engine. The railway line goes no further west than the camp because a bridge was washed out just before the start of the war. On a hunch, Ignat follows the line west, swims the river at the washed out bridge, and continues down the railway line. He soon discovers an abandoned railway steam engine trapped on the wrong side when the bridge washed out. Living inside the cab is a young German woman, Elsa, surviving by hunting and gathering. Ignat and the woman start out fighting each other and are unable to communicate due to the language barrier. Eventually they start to work together, both in repairing the steam engine to run, and effecting makeshift repairs to the washed out bridge. They arrive back in camp with the awful looking steam engine and continue to work together on repairs. Elsa and Ignat become isolated from camp people. Ignat for his devotion to his newly found railway engine, and the German woman simply by hatred for Germans from the war. Camp members summon the distant political commissar, who arrives by special train. The commissar is brutal, shooting and killing a Russian woman accused wrongfully of sleeping with the Germans. He locks up Elsa in a boxcar attached to his train and departs the camp. When Ignat learns Elsa has been taken away, he chases down the commissar on the train engine found in the woods, running on parallel tracks. Further back, the camp's main train engine, carrying many of the camp members, is also chasing down the commissar's train, angry over the brutality they witnessed. Ignat's train is faster, he manages to get ahead of the commissar's train in a winter race through the woods. He stops the Commissar by cutting him off at a rail junction, and knocks him out. Later the arriving train with much of the camp personnel find the commissar and send him packing down the rail line on a bicycle. The final scene shows Ignat and Elsa making their escape on a pump type railway hand car, to start a new life elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

It was probably written in the 6th century Byzantine Palaestina Prima. Textual tradition The text is known from three Greek manuscript copies written between the 14th and 16th centuries, and one Coptic‚ÄìArabic bilingual translation from the late 14th century. The first modern edition of the Coptic text was published in 1900/1901. The Greek text was first described in 1931, but published for the first time only in 2007. Origin and authorship The text was originally written in Palaestina Prima and in the Greek language. The Coptic manuscripts names its author as Apa Seba (Arabic: Saba), referring to Saint Sabas of Palestine (439‚Äì532). Internal evidence, however, leads to a somewhat later dating of the text, in the second half of the 6th century. It has been hypothesized that it was written by a follower of Sabas, possibly a monk in the monastery of Mar Saba, which had been founded by Sabas. A certain anti- philosophical polemic tendency expressed by the text can be related to the Origenist controversies of the mid-6th century, in which Mar Saba had played an important role.Bandt, S.4‚Äì8. Contents The anonymous author of the treatise declares he was prompted to the study of the secret meanings of the letters by the words of the Apocalypse, I am the Alpha and Omega, and that he subsequently received a vision about them on Mount Sinai. The author proposes a re-modelled Greek alphabet reduced to 22 letters on the model of the 22 letters of Hebrew (discounting Xi Œû and Psi Œ®), and with the Hebrew letter names. He then interprets these letters as symbolic figures of 22 works of divine creation in the biblical Creation according to Genesis, and of 22 corresponding works of salvation by Christ, elaborating this theory through descriptions of the various letters and interpretations of their shapes. This is followed by an account of the history of the alphabet, which weaves together elements of Greek mythology and the Hebrew Bible as well as several Jewish and pagan texts: according to this account, the Hebrew alphabet was first handed down to mankind by divine inspiration during the generation of Enoch, but was lost during the Confusion of Tongues. God subsequently revealed the Greek alphabet on a tablet of stone, which, after the Deluge, was brought to Phoenicia and Greece by Cadmos. A long section of the text is devoted especially to the letter Waw and its Greek equivalent, Digamma (called Episemon in the treatise), the numeral sign for \\"6\\". This sign is interpreted as a special symbol of Christ. At a later point in the text, this idea is further connected to the interpretation of all three extra-alphabetic numeral signs of Greek (\\"Episemon\\" for 6, Koppa for 90, and Sampi for 900) as symbols of the Holy Trinity, i.e. Christ, the Holy Ghost and God the Father respectively.Bandt, p.41. The final chapters of the treatise engage in speculation about more general topics, including the history of mankind ‚Äì whose key events are related symbolically to the sequence of vowels and consonants in the alphabet ‚Äì, a discussion of Christology dealing with issues related to the Council of Chalcedon, and reflections upon the name of Adam.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 March 1982, and was vested in the Trust on 30 October 1985. The church is built of flint and has a Norman north door. The door has single columns which are headed by simple scallop- shaped carvings with fan-shaped leaves in the scallops. The short embattled west tower has a tiled pyramidal roof. It contains three bells which were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough following fire damage to the bells which previously hung there; another source lists four, including a bell from the Salisbury foundry of c.1400. The windows in the nave and Early English chancel and low tower also date from the 13th century. The tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. Inside are the Royal Arms of 1636. The font is of a style popular in the 15th century, although it was made in 1833. The funerary hatchment is also from the 1830s. The church was restored in 1833 by Thomas Henry Wyatt, during which the roof of nave was raised. In 1933 the parish of St George was combined with St Mary's, the other church in the village, which continues in use. In 1988 the church was used as a location for the filming of the BBC television series First Born with Charles Dance ringing the church's bells.

A representative from the United Farm Workers Union, saying that the union would like to set up an information table on the church lawn and pass out information about the struggles of Cesar Chavez, who had organized the union.

The film follows the adventures of a skiptracer and his girlfriend as they attempt to repossess a radio that has not been paid for. Unbeknownst to them, a bag of stolen jewels has been concealed inside the radio by a gang of criminals. Plot Bill Lannigan (John Dilson), boss of Skip Tracers Ltd., a skiptrace agency which tracks down people who have not kept up payments on their purchases, gives his agent Jimmy Parker (James Dunn) an ultimatum: he has thirty days to become as successful as his competitor, Miles Hanover (Dave O'Brien), or he will be fired. Jimmy and his girlfriend Mary Mulvaney (Frances Gifford), the daughter of a policeman, try to repossess a radio from Lulu Driscoll (Rita La Roy), who has not kept up her payments. Jimmy is unaware that stolen jewels have been hidden inside the radio. These jewels were stolen from a famous movie star named Connie Hill (Anna Lisa). Since Jimmy is persistent and forces his way into Lulu's hotel room to take the radio, Lulu calls the police and they arrest both him and Mary and put them in jail. Meanwhile, Hill's manager, John Lawrence (William Hall), strongly suspects that her fianc√© Steve Brady (George Douglas) is involved in her jewel theft. Lawrence and Hill listen in on a conversation between Brady and a man called Duke Jurgens (Paul Bryar) as they talk about a share in the robbery. Lawrence hires Skip Tracers to get the jewels back and Lannigan tells Hanover, Jimmy's competitor, to handle the case. Released from jail, Jimmy decides on a whim to marry Mary. He puts a down payment on a house and they buy furniture from a widow who is selling the contents of her house cheaply. Jimmy then goes to find Lulu to retrieve both the radio and the jewels but discovers that she's moved. Meanwhile, Hanover sees Brady being abducted by Jurgens and his gang. The gang goes to Lulu's new residence to find the missing jewels. When they discover Hanover spying on them, they tie him up, while both Lulu and Brady are bound and put in the trunk of a stolen car. As Jurgens and his men rummage through the house trying to find the jewels, they are interrupted by Jimmy coming for the radio. Jurgens gives Jimmy the radio just to get rid of him. As Jimmy puts the radio in his trunk, the bag of jewels falls out the back. Jimmy recognizes the stolen car parked outside the house as another on his list of skiptrace items, so he takes the stolen car and sends Mary home with their car. Jurgens and his men chase after Jimmy, ending with the police stopping both vehicles. Jimmy's new father-in-law is one of the policemen, and Jimmy shows him he has found the jewels and will get the reward money from the insurance company. He and Mary return to their new home, where they find they were double-crossed by the woman who sold them their furniture: it was all repossessed by skiptracers.

Critical reception The Daily News of New York wrote: \\"The presentation of 'Hold That Woman,' is better than the production. That the picture has been put together with as little expense as possible is evident but it is invested with humor and clever situations. And the acting is all right\\". Dunn's performance earned complimentary reviews.

A brief mention in The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky, observed: \\"Dunn with his oldtime fire keeps the proceedings rolling merrily along and as this, too, is out and out melodrama Mr. Dunn is kept quite active\\".

Overview Chinese annals contain a number of references to the Guifang, the earliest are the records in the Bamboo Annals which state that during the Shang Dynasty a people known as the G«îir√≥ng (Jung) () had already been attacked by the Zhou leader Jili in 1119 BCE, the thirty-fifth year of the Shang King Wu Yi. Historians believe that the Guirong were identical to the Guifang.Nicola Di Cosmo, The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China//The Cambridge History of Ancient China, p. 919 The name Guifang appeared during the reign of the King Kang of Zhou (r. 1005/03‚Äì978 BCE). They were probably a people located northeast of the initial Zhou domain. According to the Xiao Yu Ding (Â∞èÁõÇÈºé) bronze vessel inscriptions, cast in the twenty-fifth year of King Kang (979 BC), after two successful battles against the Guifang, captured enemies were brought to the Zhou temple and offered to the king. The prisoners numbered over 13,000 with four chiefs who were subsequently executed. Zhou also captured a large amount of booty. The Yijing or \\"Book of Changes\\" mentions a Shang King, probably Wu Ding (r. 1250-1192 BCE),Creel (1970), p. 232. fighting against the Guifang, \\"attacked the Demon region, but was three years in subduing it.\\"tr. James Legge, The I Ching, p. 196. Later authors including Sima Qian, Ying Shao, Wei Zhao and Jin Zhuo ,Sima Qian, \\"Shiji\\", Bo-na, 1958, Ch. 110, p. 1a without citing any arguments, stipulated that Xunyu or Guifang were the terms designated for nomadic people who during the Han dynasty were transcribed as Xiongnu in Chinese. This view was also held by the Tang dynasty commentator Sima Zhen.Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on the history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", p. 276 As a result of phonetical studies and comparisons based on the inscriptions on bronze and the structure of the characters, Wang Guowei came to the conclusion that the tribal names in the annalistic sources Guifang, Xunyu, Xianyu, Xianyun, Jung, Di, and Hu designated one and the same people, who later entered history under the name Xiongnu.Wang Guowei, \\"Guantang Jilin\\" (ËßÄÂ†ÇÈõÜÊûó, Wang Guowei collection of works), Ch.2, Ch. 13Taskin V.S., 1968, \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", \\"Science\\", Moscow, p.10 The Shang state had a system of writing attested to by bronze inscriptions and oracle bones, which record Shang troops fighting frequent wars with neighboring nomadic herdsmen from the inner Asian steppes. In his oracular divinations, a Shang king repeatedly showed concern about the fang (Êñπ) groups of barbarians outside his inner tu (Âúü) regions in the center of Shang territory. A particularly hostile Tufang group from the Yanshan region is regularly mentioned in divinatory records. Another Chinese ethnonym for the animal husbandry nomads was ma (È©¨) or \\"equine\\" barbarians mentioned at the Shang western military frontier in the Taihang Mountains, where they fought and may have used chariots. The exact time period when the oldest phonetization of the name \\"Hun\\" had the form Guifang remains only vaguely determined: Sima Qian stated that in the earlier pre-historic period the Huns were called Hu and Jung (Pinyin Rong), in the late pre-historic period they were called Xunyu, in the literate period starting with the Shang Dynasty when they were called Guifan, in the following Zhou Dynasty (1046‚Äì256 BC) they were called Xianyun. From the start of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), the Chinese annalists called them Xiongnu.Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian Ch. 1, l. 4b, Ch. 110, l. 1a, notesTaskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", p. 10  References = Citations  Sources *  See also  * Ethnic groups in Chinese history Category:Ancient peoples of China Category:Shang dynasty ","title":"Guifang"},{"id":"29117639","text":"Tenerife prior to the Castilian conquest.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History St Martin's originated as a chapel of ease, and what now remains was the chancel of a medieval parish church. It was probably altered in the 14th or the 15th century. In 1866 a new church was added to it, and it became the south aisle of that church. This enlargement was designed by Samuel Pountney Smith, and cost ¬£1,600 (). In 1973 most of the work carried out in 1866 was demolished, leaving a single-cell building. The arcade of the 1866 building has been retained, it has been blocked, and forms the north wall of the present building. A bell formerly in the church is now the Sanctus bell in St Alkmund's Church, Shrewsbury. It was cast in 1720 by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester. The church was declared redundant on 1 June 1973, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 14 November 1974. Architecture=Exterior The building is constructed in sandstone with a tile roof. The nave and chancel form a single cell. The south side of the church contains two buttresses, three square-headed windows with two or three lights, a round-arched priest's door from the 12th century, and a 19th-century doorway. On the north side is the former nave arcade in three bays into which 20th-century three-light windows have been inserted. At the west end are round-arched windows, and a doorway that formerly led to the tower staircase. The east end contains a two-light window. Interior Many of the carved wooden fittings were made by Rev E. D. Poole, the vicar of the church in the 19th century. These include the altar table and the reredos, the choir stalls, the pews, the lectern and the pulpit. On each side of the altar are boards containing the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer. The octagonal stone font dates probably from the 16th century; it has a 19th- century base and cover. The oak parish chest dates probably from the 17th century. To the left of the south door is a royal coat of arms, and on the east wall is a pair of benefactors' boards. The monuments include a stone coffin slab from the 14th century carved with the bust of a man above a foliated cross. There are a variety of war-related memorials inside: *Plaque to Flora Constance Kelly, missionary wife of a former Rector, who died a victim of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. *Roll of Honour to men of the parish who served in World War I. *Stained-glass window in south wall to Lance Corporal William Williams, Welsh Guards, killed in action in World War I in 1918, as well as to Edward and Marie Williams and Stephen Lacey, all three men said to be longstanding friends. External features In the churchyard is a sundial that was originally a churchyard cross. It is dated 1638, is octagonal and is constructed in sandstone. It consists of a chamfered base and two steps, on which is a baluster and a copper dial plate. It is listed at Grade II. The churchyard contains a war grave of a soldier of World War I, Also buried in the churchyard, within a family grave, are the ashes of Archdeacon the Earl of Cavan (died 1950), a chaplain veteran of the same war. The parish war memorial, in the form of a marble cross listing the dead from both World Wars, including a local World War I soldier named Martin Luther (ironic in a war against Germany), stands in the churchyard.

Completed in 1929, the ship was initially assigned to the China Station and was transferred to the Africa Station in 1935. During the Second World War, Bridgewater spent most of her time on convoy escort duties off the West African coast although she did play a minor role in the Battle of Dakar in 1940. She was replaced in that role before the end of the war by more modern ships and was relegated to training duties in the UK. The ship was reduced to reserve shortly after the end of the war and was sold for scrap in 1947. Construction and design HMS Bridgewater was ordered from Hawthorn Leslie on 19 September 1927, one of two Bridgwater-class sloops ordered from Hawthorn Leslie that day.Hague 1993, p. 6. The Bridgewaters were intended as replacements for the Flower-class sloops, and were to combine the role of peacetime patrol work at distant overseas stations (with the Bridgewaters being specifically intended for service in the Persian Gulf) with a wartime role as minesweepers.Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, p. 55.Hague 1993, pp. 10‚Äì11. Bridgewater was long overallHague 1993, p. 23. and between perpendiculars,Parkes 1931, p. 76. with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boiler. The turbines developed a total of and were designed to give a maximum speed of . The main armament consisted of a pair of QF four-inch (102 mm) Mk V guns on the ship's centreline, one forward and one aft, with the forward gun on a high-angle mount, capable of anti-aircraft fire and the second gun on a low-angle mount, for anti-surface use only. Two 3-pounder saluting guns were also carried, while the anti-submarine armament initially consisted of four depth charges. The ship's crew consisted of 96 officers and ratings.Brown 2007, p. 24. Bridgewater was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie's Tyneside shipyard on 6 February 1928 and was launched without ceremony on 14 September. Bridgewater reached a speed of during sea trials and was commissioned on 14 March 1929. In 1938, the aft four-inch gun was replaced by one on a high-angle mounting and the two saluting guns were exchanged for a pair of quadruple Vickers anti-aircraft (AA) machineguns mounts. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the ship had been fitted with ASDIC, and the depth charge outfit was increased to 15 charges.Brown 2007, p. 23. Service While ordered for service in the Persian Gulf, both Bridgewater and her sister ship were first deployed to the China Station. In early August 1930, Bridgewater ferried troops of the Green Howards to Hankou, formerly site of a British concession, in response to threats posed by the fighting of the Central Plains War to foreigners. In 1931 Bridgewater, along with the survey ships and carried out a survey of the shallow area of the South China Sea known as the Dangerous Ground as part of a search for potential secret seaplane bases in case of war.Hancox and Prescott 1995, p. 37. In August 1931 she took part in the search for the missing cargo ship , which had been sunk by a typhoon off Taichow Island. Bridgewater remained on the China Station until 1935, when she joined the Africa Station (later known as the South Atlantic Station). The ship returned to Devonport Dockyard on 1 September 1936 for a month's refit and then returned to Simonstown. Bridgewater had her second high-angle four-inch gun installed during a refit there. It was interrupted by the Munich Crisis of September 1938 when she was ordered to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The ship later resumed her refit and remained in South Africa until she returned to Devonport for another refit on 13 April 1939. It was completed on 17 May when Bridgewater began a leisurely cruise back to South Africa and arrived there in August.Hague 1993, pp. 23‚Äì24. Second World War When the Second World War began in the following month, the ship was briefly transferred to Freetown for convoy escort duties before returning to South Africa. She returned to Freetown in January 1940 and remained there until she needed her bottom cleaned in June.Hague 1993, p. 24. On 13 September, Bridgewater rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French, and resumed her former duties after its unsuccessful conclusion.Rohwer 2005, pp. 38, 42. The lack of docking facilities in Freetown forced the ship to return to Simonstown to have her hull cleaned in February 1941 and January 1942. In July, she escorted a convoy to the UK and then began a lengthy refit that saw her Vickers .50 machine guns replaced by a pair of Oerlikon light AA guns, a Type 271 surface-search radar was installed and she also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Bridgewater returned to Freetown on 9 October, having covered Convoy OS 42 en route. In December, she escorted the badly damaged light cruiser to Trinidad and returned in January 1943. The ship escorted Convoy SL 136 to Liverpool and began a refit at Southampton that was intended to prepare her for convoy work with the 40th Escort Group in the Atlantic Ocean. Bridgewaters radar suite was upgraded with an improved Type 271Q radar and the addition of a Type 291 aircraft search radar. Her light AA armament was augmented by another pair of Oerlikons and she received a Hedgehog anti- submarine spigot mortar. However, the ship proved to be too worn out for her intended duties and she was transferred to the 3rd Submarine Flotilla where she served as a target ship for the rest of the war. Bridgewater was reduced to reserve in July 1945 at Ardrossan and was subsequently used for static bomb trials. The ship was sold for scrap on 22 May 1947 and subsequently broken up at Gelliswick Bay, Milford Haven by Howells.

Equations  The Beer-Lambert law states that there is a logarithmic dependence between the transmission (or transmissivity), T, of light through a substance and the product of the absorption coefficient of the substance, Œ±, and the distance the light travels through the material (i.e. the path length), ‚Ñì. The absorption coefficient can, in turn, be written as a product of either a molar absorptivity of the absorber, Œµ, and the concentration c of absorbing species in the material, or an absorption cross section, œÉ, and the (number) density N of absorbers. (see Beer Lambert Law link for full derivation) BSA linearity : A = \\\\varepsilon \\\\ell c Spectroscopy with a variable pathlength cell takes advantage of Beer-Lambert law to determine concentrations of various solutions. By knowing the molar absorbtivity of the material and varying the path length, absorption can be plotted as a function of path length. See sample plot to the right: By taking a linear regression of the linear plot above an expression relating Absorbance, A, slope, m, pathlength and concentration can be derived. A linear equation of two variables can be derived, : y=mx+b by equating in terms of units we get, : A=m\\\\ell+b Since the slope of the line is in units of Abs/Pathlength, slope can be expressed as, : m={A \\\\over \\\\ell} by inserting into Beer‚Äôs Law we get, : m=\\\\varepsilon c This is the slope spectroscopy equation.  Applications  Variable pathlength techniques can be applied in any situation where Beer‚Äôs law can be applied. It provides an analytical method that averages out minor variations in sample preparation consistency. It also provides a means to calculate concentrations without calibrations curves or serial dilution of samples. Variable pathlength absorption spectroscopy is typically used when highly reproducible data is a necessity. This can be in the fields of medicine, biotechnology, pharmacology, and drug discovery. It is particularly useful in the protein purification stage of biotechnology where accurate concentrations of various proteins are required or in crystallography. Determining the relative ratio of protein to DNA is common practice and can be calculated by finding the slope at the corresponding absorption peaks and taking their ratio. This method is used to find the purity of a sample containing these two types of molecule.  Experimental methods  In ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy or spectroscopy in general a 1 cm pathlength cuvette is used to measure samples. The cuvette is filled with sample, light is passed through the sample and intensity readings are taken. The slope spectroscopy technique can be applied using the same methods as in absorption spectroscopy. With the advent of accurate linear stages, variable pathlength absorption spectroscopy is easily applied experimentally. Other experimental methods include using ratios of slopes to build extinction coefficient spectra. This is possible because application of slope spectroscopy allows the scientist to keep concentration levels constant and vary path lengths.  Background subtraction  Base line no base line Variable pathlength absorption spectroscopy uses a determined slope to calculate concentration. As stated above this is a product of the molar absorbtivity and the concentration. Since the actual absorbance value is taken at many data points at equal intervals, background subtraction is generally unnecessary. The image on the right is a linear plot showing both the background corrected data and the raw data. This shows that the absorbance values on the plot are offset by an equal amount and the slope of the two plots are equal. Thus, the concentration calculated from the two plots is equal. Other scalar components that contribute to the absorbance of a given sample like contaminants on the cuvette or a different cuvette material also are averaged out during the slope measurement. The technique is also applicable for in line measurements for TFF and chromatography applications.

The series was published in Japan by Fujimi Shobo and serialized in Monthly Dragon Age magazine. The manga has been distributed in English by Tokyopop. The story is about an immortal girl, Seine Miyazaki, and an orphan boy, Tatsuya Tsugawa, who gets involved with her. Plot After both his parents died in an accident, Tsugawa Tatsuya is now left with millions in inheritance that he cannot use. In the weeks after, he is still mourning and thinking about his father's last words, \\"A Tsugawa family's man must be a man of great caliber\\". However, Tatsuya is not confident he can fulfill his father's last wish. One day a week after the accident, he meets Seine Miyazaki, a strange girl who seems to enjoy being bullied. Tatsuya believes he can help her although his friends only see her as a masochist pervert, and Seine herself told him to mind his own business. Seine hunts creatures of the sea, a kind of parasitic bug that controls humans and influences them to do hateful things. She possesses an immortal body and a beast called AiON that is used to lure and devour the bugs from inside the human host. She and the bugs naturally have an impulse to kill each other on contact. Even so, Tatsuya still cannot just leave her alone. He wants to help her. Characters=Main Characters ; : (Drama CD) :Miyazaki Seine is a 300-year-old girl with an immortal body who Tatsuya invites to live in his home; before that she lived in a cardboard box in a park. In the first episode, Seine looks like a masochist because she seems to like being bullied. Actually, she becomes close to people who are infected by \\"mushis\\", a kind of parasitic, mind-controlling bugs, in order to hunt them. Her hunting ways go against the kind and pacifist Tatsuya's beliefs. Her motive is to avenge her foster father Shimon's death by killing the people of sea, the mermaids. She controls a black snake called Aion that lives inside her. Her weakness is her inability to swim. Tatsuya at first calls her \\"Miyazaki-san.\\" She tells Tatsuya to call her \\"Seine\\" since \\"Miyazaki\\" is just made up; \\"Seine\\" merely sounds most like her real name. She claims to only love Shimon, but she is slowly warming up to Tatsuya. ; : (Drama CD) :After the death of his parents in a car accident, Tatsuya tries to live to fulfill his father's last wish of becoming a \\"high caliber\\" man. After \\"saving\\" Seine from bullying, he insisted on trying to help her even after finding out the real goal of Seine. He is kind, optimistic and believes in other people's good side which is sometimes an obstacle in Seine's revenge. He is a bad cook, but Seine somehow is not bothered by his food. He has a crush on Seine and wants to be acknowledged as a \\"high caliber\\" man by her. ;Nagisa Yoshiyuki :Nagisa is a girl in Tatsuya's class, a long time acquaintance, and would probably like to get closer to Tatsuya, but Nagisa has had violent allergic reactions whenever she is in Tatsuya's house ever since Tatsuya found a lost puppy (soon to be Crokette). She stays away from the house and the dog, effectively putting some distance between him and her, even though she loves him. She is the fourth person shown in the story to be infected by a \\"mushi\\". ;Minato-kun :Minato-kun is a boy in Tatsuya's school, friend to both Tatsuya and Nagisa. Nagisa asks him to keep her allergy to dogs confidential. ;Shizuki (Pistis Sophia) :Shizuki is the older sister of the \\"Akuma Twins\\". Being the older, she is sarcastic, lazy, and smart, but she has a weak body; she can get sick and tired easily, cannot swim in pools as a result of the chlorine, and almost was killed by Tatsuya's food. She has an immortal body and has lived for centuries. She gave immortal bodies to Seine and Shimon. Her former name was \\"Pistis Sophia\\" but she changed because it was \\"stupid\\". She is a Oyaji- con (she is attracted to \\"handsome\\" grown up men). The name Pistis Sophia is a character from an earlier work of Yuna Kagesaki's: Chibi Vampire, who is actually their younger sister Psyche. Shizuki and her sister call Seine \\"Sehne\\". ;Yuzuki :Yuzuki is Shizuki's younger sister. She is the opposite side of her sister: her body has superhuman strength, she is diligent and a good cooker but is a little dumb. She is good-hearted and satisfies her Onee-sama's orders. She also has an immortal body and has lived for centuries. She is a Lolicon (she get excited by children, especially girls) to the point to kissing every children on their mouth upon seeing them. ;Shimon :Shimon was Seine's third foster father and the one person who showed her kindness when she was young. He was known as a magician in his time and was also known to be 1700 years old (about 300 years ago in present time of the story). He bore the \\"Aion\\" mark, just like Seine does at the present time, but he had it across the right shoulder and was able to use Aion's power for his own, unknown, reasons. Seine is bent on revenge after the mermaid ate Shimon, but after Ariel said that they would \\"return\\" Shimon to Seine she just spit onto Seine's forehead, causing her to go into a coma-like sleep. ;Minagi :Tatsuya's first cousin, once-removed, an elementary school aged girl. Her parents were the second and third ones shown in the story to be infected by a \\"mushi\\". ;Tsukasa :Tsugawa family lawyer, responsible for managing Tatsuya's money until he gets old enough. Tatsuya calls him his \\"brother\\", which he explains as foster- brother since Tsukasa was in the house so much in earlier years. When he was first seen, he had been knocked unconscious by the Akuma twins and took a long time to regain consciousness. Creatures of Sea ;\\"Mushis\\" :\\"Mushi\\" is the name of any kind of mind controlling bug. They infect humans by touch or bite. An infected human has a normal life until they see Seine's face, then they develop an irrepressible rage toward her and a desire to kill her. Seine usually refrains from destroying the mushi before the infected human kills her once, otherwise the desire to kill her remains even after the mushi is removed. ;Mermaids :They are Seine's prey. They are 7 in all. As of the start of the story, Seine believes she has killed one of them. Up to chapter 32, five of them have been introduced and named. ;Sheila :The youngest of the mermaids; she is despised by all her older sisters except for Ariel. Seine thought she had killed her some 300 years before, but Ariel restored her body almost entirely, leaving her badly scarred about the neck and unable to talk, but with the ability to change herself to have legs and walk about on land. She was introduced as a new transfer student; and Tatsuya is given the assignment of teaching her sign language. Her true goal is infect a lot of people to order to take revenge on Seine for leaving her without her voice. She falls in love with Tatsuya. ;Anoshu :The fourth of the mermaids. A bit of a dimwit, and not entirely a bad sort. ;Enati :The third of the mermaids. Possesses Simon's skull, and supposedly all his knowledge. ;Bella :The second of the mermaids. She is sadistic, heartless and cruel. She is respected (feared) by her younger sisters, with Sheila fearing her the most. The only one she fears is her older sister Ariel. ;Ariel :The first mermaid and the eldest of them all. Ariel is also biggest of them and the most powerful. Only being overcoming for her \\"Father\\". She is the only one who is nice to Sheila and gave her a new body to replace the one that she had lost. She admits to loving Sheila more than she loves her other sisters. Manga On July 2, 2010 Tokyopop announced it had acquired a title license for Aion's release in North America at Anime Expo with a first volume release set at January 8, 2011. Tokyopop released three volumes total before closing its North American publishing division in April 2011. It remains unclear if the series will ever be picked up again by another licenser for North American release. Reception Reviews on the manga were mixed, overall Anime News Network gave the first two volumes a C rating while ANN praised the story's \\"fantastical mix-and-match of ideas\\" and \\"Lively conversation and psychological gamesmanship in the later chapters\\" however, it was also seen to have plain artwork and too many subplots. The second volume also was said to focus too much on secondary characters with no plot advancement. Newsarama called the artwork of the series so far \\"definitely appealing\\" and states it has great deal of potential with occasionally quite creative angles. Newsarama also goes on to say that the relationship is left unexplained between the two main characters and although the questions being put forward are intriguing they are not really suspenseful and that sort of slow build between the two main characters can sometimes make it difficult to judge a series solely by its first volume. The Manga Critic did a short take on the first volume calling it \\"maudlin, nonsensical, and boring\\" with bad artwork the bottom line being that the story is both predictable and emotionally flat, making it a tough sell for all but the most ardent Chibi Vampire fans. Sequential Tart gave the first two volumes both a grade of 7, saying that the first book was a solid set up for the series and has a lot of possibilities on where it can go, the review goes on to say that the plot has a serious flaw in having Tatsuya's parents and aunt and uncle out of the picture fast to get him and Seine living together in the same house. The second volume had more mixed feelings with the focus on Seine and learning more about her background and relationships being good but the fan service at the start of the volume being questioned.

Plot After getting out of prison, Danny Kean (James Cagney) shocks the gang he leads by quitting. He wants his first stint in jail to be his last, and he has always dreamed of becoming a newspaper reporter. He hands leadership over to Jerry \\"the Mug\\" (Ralf Harolde), even though he suspects Jerry sold him out. Al McLean (Ralph Bellamy), the city editor of the sleazy Graphic News, had offered him a job when he got out, but when Danny shows up, Al is reluctant to take him on. Just then, Al's boss, Grover (Robert Barrat), laments that nobody has gotten a photograph of Hennessy (G. Pat Collins), a fireman who responded to a fire at the fireman's own house, found the dead bodies of his wife and her lover, and barricaded himself in the ruins with a gun. Danny sneaks in, pretends to be an insurance adjuster to lull Hennessy's suspicions, and steals his wedding picture. As a result, Danny is made a staff photographer. When some journalism students take a tour of the Graphic News (an example of everything not to do), Danny is attracted to Pat Nolan (Patricia Ellis). She goes out on a date with him, much to the annoyance of \\"sob sister\\" reporter Allison (Alice White), who makes it quite clear that she wants Danny too, though she is Al's girlfriend. A complication arises when Danny discovers that not only is Pat's father, Casey (Robert Emmett O'Connor), a police lieutenant, but Casey was the one who shot him (six times) and caught him. Naturally, Casey orders his daughter to stay away from Danny. However, Al gets him to change his mind by arranging for another newspaper to print a flattering story about him that gets him promoted to captain. When a woman is scheduled to be executed at Sing Sing, the Graphic News is the only paper not invited. Danny steals the invitation of another reporter, but finds that it is not transferable. However, Captain Nolan is in charge of the proceedings and lets him in. Casey takes a picture of the woman in the electric chair using a hidden camera strapped to his ankle (echoing the real-life photo taken of murderer Ruth Snyder in 1928). The other reporters find out and inform the police. A wild car chase ensues, but Danny delivers his prize to Grover and is handsomely rewarded. The photograph is printed on the front page. However, Pat breaks up with him after her father is demoted as a result. Al arranges for Danny to hide from the angry police at Allison's apartment, as she will be out of town covering another story. She returns early and eagerly embraces an uninterested Danny. Al comes in at that moment, and Danny loses his best friend. Danny takes to drinking to drown his sorrows. Al tracks him down and apologizes; he has found out about Allison. Al announces he has quit drinking (which had lost him jobs at all the respectable newspapers) and quit the News. They find out that Jerry the Mug has killed two policemen during a robbery and is the target of a massive manhunt. They realize that if Danny can find him, the scoop will get them jobs at any paper. Danny tracks Jerry down and pretends to be on his side. The police find his hideout without Danny's help, and a fierce shootout ensues. Danny secretly takes photographs of Jerry's last moments as he's being shot. When the police break in, Danny claims that he was working undercover for Nolan, which earns him a promotion back to captain. Danny and Pat are reunited, and the inside story is Danny and Al's passport to jobs on the Daily Record.

A native of New York, Houghton came to New Mexico when it was still a Mexican territory, and became a successful merchant. Though lacking any legal education, he was appointed Chief Justice when New Mexico was occupied by the United States in 1846 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1850, Houghton led an anti-slavery faction in the drafting of New Mexico's proposed constitution during its first attempt at statehood. His service as Chief Justice ended in 1851, and he practiced law in Santa Fe, as he would during much of his life, and also served as a district attorney during the American Civil War. Houghton was again appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of New Mexico Territory from 1865 to 1869. He made numerous political enemies, and his rulings regarding property confiscated during the Civil War were widely criticized as contrary to basic legal principles. After his replacement on the bench, Houghton spent his last years in private legal practice. Early life and business Houghton was born in New York in 1811.. Sources do not specify where in New York he was born or lived. He attended college and then worked as a civil engineer. Houghton arrived in New Mexico in 1843, traveling over the Santa Fe Trail on a trading expedition. ; ; . He entered into a mercantile partnership in Santa Fe with brothers Eugene and Thomas Leitensdorfer, doing business as E. Leitensdorfer & Co. from 1844 until 1848, when it went bankrupt.; . Prior to its failing, it was considered the leading mercantile house west of the Missouri River.. Among the goods Houghton sold, he is credited with introducing steel point pens; only quill pens were previously in use in New Mexico. . Houghton also began a partnership with Jared W. Folger in 1847, operating as Houghton & Folger.. Chief Justice of the New Mexico provisional government: 1846‚Äì1851 Houghton was appointed the U.S. consul in Santa Fe in 1845.. He was serving in that capacity when Santa Fe was occupied by the United States Army in August 1846, shortly after the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The military governor, General Stephen W. Kearney, quickly formed a civilian provisional government, and on September 22, 1846, appointed Houghton as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court alongside two associate justices.; (providing date, and identifying the appointing document: Ex. Doc. #60, page 22, page 176). Like both of his colleagues, Houghton had no legal training, though he read law as a hobby and continued to study it while serving on the bench.; . As a consequence of Houghton's ignorance of the law, the court's record-keeping was inadequate and irregular, and he also issued no rules of practice to guide attorneys in his court.. In the two terms he would ultimately serve on the bench, Houghton apparently filed only one written opinion.. Most of the bar of New Mexico at the time, however, was even more ignorant of basic legal principles than Houghton.. Even apart from those limitations, the court's functioning was frequently impaired by the military's interference with its orders.. In 1847, Houghton presided over several trials for treason resulting from the Taos Revolt, an insurrection against the American occupation that culminated in the assassination of Governor Charles Bent. gives a detailed description of the insurrection and its consequences; see also and . Houghton's dramatic sentencing of conspirator Antonio Maria Trujillo to death by hanging has been frequently noted by historians:For historians taking special note of Houghton's sentence, see, e.g., (\\"The sentence imposed by the court is worthy of a place in this connection, as it is the only sentence of the kind passed by any court in the history of New Mexico\\"); (\\"If not the trial, certainly the sentence imposed upon Trujillo will live as one of the most interesting in New Mexico history ...\\"); (\\"Judge Joab Houghton's sentence is not only the earliest, but one of the most eloquent of the many such condemnations pronounced by New Mexico's territorial judiciary.\\"). It is not certain, however, whether the sentence was ever carried out., claims that Houghton himself joined a petition for clemency on Trujillo's behalf, and that acting Governor Donaciano Vigil pardoned him after President James K. Polk declined to get involved. Torrez, in \\"The Revolt and Treason Trials of 1847,\\" reports that a \\"diligent search has found no primary evidence of Trujillo's execution or any evidence of any official actions taken by Colonel Price, but all indications are that Price subsequently exercised the pardon or at least ordered Trujillo released.\\" But see (\\"Trujillo was hanged at Sante Fe, New Mexico, on April 16, 1847, but the historical record contains none of the details of that event.\\"). Houghton was strongly opposed to slavery and believed its introduction to New Mexico would have a detrimental effect on its people and industries. These views made Houghton extremely unpopular with members of Congress from southern states.. In New Mexico's first bid for statehood, Houghton led a faction of anti-slavery delegates in the 1850 constitutional convention. Commanding the majority, Houghton wrote much of the constitution himself, which contained a declaration against slavery and a total rejection of land claims by Texas to portions of New Mexico.. Houghton's main political rival in the statehood issue, Richard Hanson Weightman, viciously attacked Houghton in public speeches and filed charges with the military governor asking for Houghton's removal. Houghton responded by challenging Weightman to a duel. The duel proceeded and ended anticlimactically. Weightman fired first but missed Houghton. Houghton, being partially deaf, did not hear the command to fire. Before Houghton could take his shot, the seconds intervened and forced Weightman to make an apology of sorts.; . Their political dispute was largely rendered moot when the bid for statehood was ended by the Compromise of 1850, which instead organized New Mexico Territory, and provided that the issue of slavery would be decided by popular vote. Between judicial appointments: private practice, political rivalries, and wartime prosecutions Houghton's service as Chief Justice ended March 1, 1851; the incoming governor of the newly formed Territory, James S. Calhoun, believed the provisional court to have been abolished by Congress.. Houghton's removal from the court possibly increased his enmity towards Calhoun, who was a pro-slavery southerner. Houghton tried to have him removed as governor, in part by alleging that Calhoun took sides with wealthy natives and Catholic Church officials against American residents.. Calhoun died the following year. Houghton also made an enemy of his successor as Chief Justice, Grafton Baker, and was one of many who actively sought Baker's removal. In 1853, Houghton appeared as a litigant in Baker's court, in a case involving a debt charged to the Leitensdorfer partnership. Baker ruled against him.. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed Baker's decision.Leitensdorfer v. Webb, . After leaving the bench, Houghton practiced law in Santa Fe, and helped form the Historical Society of New Mexico.. He was appointed Superintendent of Public Buildings on January 15, 1853, and designed the plans for the new capitol building. Its construction halted in 1857 due to lack of funds; it would not be completed until 1889, when it was repurposed as a federal courthouse that is still in use, as the Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse.. In 1861, he was appointed Register of the United States Land Office in Santa Fe; he served in that position until 1868.; . At the start of the American Civil War, Houghton took the lead in rallying support for the Union and against Texas, which had seceded.. He was named the wartime district attorney for New Mexico on September 19, 1861; he zealously got indictments for treason against several prominent citizens who he believed were southern sympathizers, but was unable to obtain any convictions.. Justice of the Territorial Supreme Court, 1865‚Äì1869 On December 21, 1865, Houghton was nominated by President Andrew Johnson to the Territorial Supreme Court, as an associate justice presiding over the Third District.Journal of the executive proceedings of the Senate of the United States of America, 1864-1866, THURSDAY, December 21, 1865. Houghton maintained a residence in Santa Fe, outside of his district, for which he was accused of ignoring the legal requirements of his position.. Houghton was also widely denounced for his handling of numerous lawsuits involving property confiscated during the American Civil War.. Among the most criticized aspects of these rulings, often attributed to his poor understanding of the law, were Houghton's assumption of jurisdiction over property in El Paso, Texas, and his insistence that the confiscation proceedings could proceed ex parte and tried without a jury.. Houghton's court consequently earned the reputation of being a mere \\"prize court\\".. In January, 1869, the territorial Legislative Council addressed a memorial to the president requesting that Houghton be replaced.; . Upon taking office, President Grant replaced the entire court, appointing Abraham Bergen to Houghton's seat.. Later life and death Houghton subsequently practiced law in Santa Fe until 1874, when he moved to Las Vegas, New Mexico.; . He died there on January 31, 1876.

The suggestion that the site originates in the Iron Age is currently unproven. Pottery found on site has been Roman or later in date. Geophysical fieldwork is planned in the near future,(date?) hopefully that will inform the debate about the castle's chronology. Pronounced ‚ÄòBynol‚Äô Castle, the current earthworks appear to demonstrate a Norman motte and bailey castle of considerable natural strength. It is likely that Gilbert of Breteuil, after the Norman conquest, acquired a block of manors centred on Broad Hinton and built the castle to oversee them. The 'motte', now severely mutilated by later quarrying, measures approximately 52 metres in diameter by 3 metres high, and its ditch is 2.3 metres deep. The inner enclosure has a bank and ditch 3.4 metres high dividing it from the outer enclosure, with a causeway entrance.

Dating from the 5th century BC, it is considered to be one of the oldest situla objects of the northern Illyrians found in the Eastern Hallstatt zone. The vessel has three rows of relief that show the ordinary life of the ruling class and also reflect the religious understanding of the world in that time. It is on display in the National Museum of Slovenia.

The film is a four-hander, starring Walls, Cathleen Nesbitt, Athole Stewart and Yvonne Arnaud. It is a screen version of the witty and sophisticated comedy of manners play of the same title by Frederick Lonsdale, which had been a big critical and popular success when premiered at London's Globe Theatre in 1929, with Stewart and Arnaud cast in the roles which they would recreate in the film. A surviving review of the film notes favourably: \\"Glittering, superficial, but very skilful...superbly played.\\" Plot Over the course of their marriage, Geoffrey Lymes (Walls) has become increasingly exasperated by the shallowness and superficiality of his wife Anne (Nesbitt). He despairs of her ridiculous affectations, social-climbing aspirations and constant embarrassing attempts in company to show herself as an elegant, cultured sophisticate. He feels trapped in a relationship where, as he observes, a wife \\"does nothing to entitle her husband to divorce her, but a thousand things that entitle him to murder her\\". Geoffrey's old college friend Ernest Melton (Stewart) and his French wife Elma (Arnaud) arrive at the Lymes' country home for a weekend visit. Ernest is an archetypal upper-class twit, wealthy but not overly bright, and completely cowed and dominated by the self- assured and outspoken Elma. He too finds married life less than satisfactory. Anne immediately goes into full desperate-to-impress mode and, to Geoffrey's amusement, Ernest seems completely charmed and captivated by her ludicrous airs and pretensions, while Anne is thrilled to have found an appreciative audience. Geoffrey meanwhile is strongly attracted to the feisty Elma, and his interest is apparently reciprocated. As the pair discuss their respective spouses with withering scorn, they realise that all four are married to the wrong person. They hatch a plan to throw Anne and Ernest together as much as possible in the hope that they will compromise themselves. Matters reach a head when it appears that Ernest and Anne are about to run away together. Geoffrey sees this as the perfect opportunity to achieve his aims without any blame attaching to himself or Elma. He confronts Ernest in feigned outrage, expressing his shock and disgust at his friend's conduct, while slyly stressing that if Ernest and Anne wish to be together, he can do nothing to prevent it and will give Anne a divorce. To Geoffrey's astonishment, the confused Ernest says that while he finds Anne pleasant and amusing, he does not love her and there has never been any question of the two eloping. The tables are turned, as Geoffrey is forced to admit to Ernest that he and Elma are in love.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French participants responded to the question, \\"Which books have remained in your memory?\\" (Quels livres sont rest√©s dans votre m√©moire?). The list includes both classic novels and genre fiction (Tolkien, Agatha Christie, A. C. Doyle), as well as poetry, drama and nonfiction literature (Freud's essays and the diary of Anne Frank). There are also comic books on the list, one album from each of these five francophone series: Asterix, Tintin, Corto Maltese, Blake and Mortimer and Gaston. The large number of French novels of the list is due to the demographics of the surveyed group. (Likewise, comparable lists by English language sources‚Äî- such as the two lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels published in 1998, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded‚Äî- disproportionately favor British and American authors.

The company became part of Manchester Collieries in 1929 and some of its collieries were nationalised in 1947. Geology The company's collieries were on a part of the Manchester Coalfield whose coal seams were laid down in the Carboniferous period, where some easily accessible seams were worked on a small scale before the Industrial Revolution, and extensively from the mid-19th century until the middle of the 20th century. The Coal Measures lie above a bed of Millstone Grit and are interspersed with sandstones, mudstones, shales, and fireclays. The most productive seams are in the lower two thirds of the Middle Coal Measures where coal is mined from seams between the Worsley Four Foot and Arley mines. The Coal Measures generally dip towards the south and west. Numerous small faults affect the coalfield. History In the 1840s, John Darlington leased the mineral rights of land belonging to Astley Hall and sank a pit, Astley Colliery, which subsequently became the site of Gin Pit Colliery. It was near other old shafts on Meanley's Farm. Coal had been mined in Astley before this date, on an old enclosure map North Lane was titled the \\"Coal Road\\" and later was known as \\"North Coal Pit Lane\\". In 1847 Darlington's company was known as Astley and Bedford Collieries, which had offices at Bedford Lodge in Bedford, Leigh. Gin Pit's name suggests it, or its predecessor, had horse driven winding gear and was on the site of even older coal workings. The colliery site was isolated from roads resulting in Darlington building a narrow gauge tramway worked by horses to transport coal from his pit to a basin on the Bridgewater Canal at Marsland Green. In 1851 Darlington attempted to sell his colliery, tramroad, cranes and tipplers on the canal to the Bridgewater Trustees but the operation was eventually sold to Samuel Jackson, a salt merchant and owner of Bedford Colliery or Milner's Pit which he had bought from W. E. Milner around the same time. Jackson's lease was for coal from the Worsley Four Foot mine and he was required to sink two shafts 14 feet in diameter with no workings under Astley Hall. A lease of 1857 committed the company to paying the lessors of Astley Hall a minimum annual rent of ¬£1,000 and royalties for the Bin mine of ¬£70 \\"per foot thick per Cheshire acre\\", for the Crombouke ¬£95, the Brassey ¬£70, and the Six Foot ¬£95. The lease expired in 1896. By the time the Astley Hall estate was sold in 1889, Astley and Tyldesley Collieries had paid a total of ¬£90,526 for these mines and the Worsley Four Foot mine. The deeper mines, the Seven Feet and the Trencherbone, were not included in the 1857 lease. These coal seams produced steam coal, household coal and coal for Tyldesley's gasworks. About 500 tons of coal per day was raised from the older pits. The Bedford Colliery closed in 1864 and the company concentrated its operations closer to Gin Pit. Deep pits The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) opened a line from Eccles to Wigan via Tyldesley and the Tyldesley Loopline via Leigh to Kenyon Junction in 1864, providing the impetus for the rapid exploitation of coal reserves to the south of the railway line. Jackson's Astley and Tyldesley Coal and Salt Company sank two shafts at St Georges Colliery, commonly known as Back o' t' Church, to the south of Tyldesley Station. In 1866, Nook Colliery No 1 Pit, south of Darlington's original Gin Pit was sunk. The company also sank a pit at Cross Hillock south of the Leigh to Manchester road in near Higher Green Lane but flooding caused it to close by 1887. The deep collieries replaced the older pits in the area. A new shaft was sunk at Gin Pit in 1872 and a second shaft a year later at Nook Pit. St George's No 3 pit was sunk in 1883 and by 1899 Nook No 3 was in operation. In about 1888 it was discovered that miners employed by George Green's Tyldesley Coal Company had exceeded the boundaries of the company's lease and extracted coal south of Well Street which belonged to Astley and Tyldesley Collieries. Lengthy litigation followed resulting in a ¬£3,000 fine for Green's company. The company was a major employer in the area. In 1896 Nook Pit employed 480 men below ground and 125 workers on the surface. Household and manufacturing coal was produced from the Binn and Crumbouke mines. Gin Pit was smaller employing 240 underground workers and 55 on the surface. Gas coal, household and steam coal was mined from the Crumbouke and Six Foot mines. There were 629 underground workers and 137 surface workers at St Georges colliery producing gas coal, household and steam coal from the Brassey, Crumbouke, Six Feet, Seven Feet and Trencherbone mines. The surface workers included women who sorted coal on the screens at the pit brow. In 1900 the company became the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company, and in 1914 Nook No 4 Pit was sunk. Nook became the largest colliery on the Manchester Coalfield. Jackson's Sidings were built by the LNWR and extended to Gin and Nook Pits and, on the early tramroad, a locomotive replaced the horses. The company built its own standard gauge mineral railway which exchanged traffic with the LNWR at Jackson's Sidings southwest of Tyldesley Station. Coal was wound to the surface at St George's Colliery, Nook and Gin Pit. Coal for Tyldesley was sold from the landsale yard at St George's and there were smaller yards at Nook and Gin Pit but considerable quantities of coal were sent elsewhere by rail from Jackson's Sidings and by barge from Marsland Green to Partington on the Manchester Ship Canal. There was a brickworks at Nook Colliery and sheds and facilities for servicing the industrial locomotives at Gin Pit. Gin Pit had a sawmill and supplied pit props to neighbouring collieries. As a result of poor economic conditions, Astley and Tyldesley Collieries merged with other local colliery companies in 1929, becoming part of Manchester Collieries, whose Western Division consisted of John Speakman's Bedford Colliery, Fletcher, Burrows and Company of Atherton and Astley and Tyldesley Collieries. On nationalisation in 1947 the coal pits belonging to Manchester Collieries became part of the No 1 Manchester Area of the National Coal Board's (NCB) North Western Division. In 1961, the area became the NCB's East Lancashire Area. Gin Pit closed in 1955 and Nook Pit closed in August 1965. Locomotives The earliest locomotives that worked on the colliery railway system were a narrow gauge engine that worked the tramway to the Bridgewater Canal possibly named \\"Gordon\\" and \\"Tyldesley\\", a 6-coupled Manning Wardle saddle tank locomotive, bought in 1868 and renamed \\"Jackson\\" in 1872. A 2-2-0 tender locomotive \\"Lady Cornwall\\" was sold to George Peace in 1874 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's works at Miles Platting at a cost of ¬£150 and was later rebuilt as tank engine. In 1875 Manning Wardle supplied \\"Maden\\", a 6-coupled tank engine and \\"Astley\\" another 6-coupled tank locomotive was bought from Sharp Stewart in 1886. The second \\"Tyldesley\\", another 6-coupled tank engine was bought in 1894 from Peckett with \\"Jackson\\" taken in part exchange. The company bought three 0-6-0 side tank locomotives from Lowca Engineering in Whitehaven, \\"T.B. Wood\\" in 1897, \\"James Lord\\" in 1903 and \\"George Peace\\" in 1906. Two unique 0-8-0 side tank locomotives, \\"Maden\\" in 1910 and \\"Emanuell Clegg\\" in 1924 were built by Naysmith Wilson at Patricroft. Lord Street, Gin Pit village Gin Pit village Gin Pit Colliery was isolated from both Astley and Tyldesley centres. The company built the terraced houses of Gin Pit village to accommodate the workers. Some of the workforce had migrated from Staffordshire. The village streets, Peace Street, Maden Street and Lord Street, are named from former company directors as were the colliery locomotives. The first houses were built around 1874 and more added by 1909. The Astley and Tyldesley Miners' Welfare Club was built by the Miners Union and remains in the village as a social and sports club.

Mobile objects are normally tracked from an external frame considered fixed. Other frames can be defined on those mobile objects to deal with relative positions for other objects. Finally, attitudes or orientations can be described by a relationship between the external frame and the one defined over the mobile object. The orientation of a vehicle is normally referred to as attitude. It is described normally by the orientation of a frame fixed in the body relative to a fixed reference frame. The attitude is described by attitude coordinates, and consists of at least three coordinates. While from a geometrical point of view the different methods to describe orientations are defined using only some reference frames, in engineering applications it is important also to describe how these frames are attached to the lab and the body in motion. Due to the special importance of international conventions in air vehicles, several organizations have published standards to be followed. For example, German DIN has published the DIN 9300 norm for aircraftLuft- und Raumfahrt; Begriffe, Gr√∂√üen und Formelzeichen der Flugmechanik; Bewegungen des Luftfahrzeugs und der Atmosph√§re gegen√ºber der Erde (adopted by ISO as ISO 1151‚Äì2:1985). Earth bounded axes conventions Representation of the earth with parallels and meridians World reference frames: ENU and NED Basically, as lab frame or reference frame, there are two kinds of conventions for the frames: *East, North, Up (ENU), used in geography *North, East, Down (NED), used specially in aerospace This frame referenced w.r.t. Global Reference frames like Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF) non-inertial system. =World reference frames for attitude description= To establish a standard convention to describe attitudes, it is required to establish at least the axes of the reference system and the axes of the rigid body or vehicle. When an ambiguous notation system is used (such as Euler angles) the convention used should also be stated. Nevertheless, most used notations (matrices and quaternions) are unambiguous. Earth Centered Earth Fixed and East, North, Up coordinates. Tait‚ÄìBryan angles are often used to describe a vehicle's attitude with respect to a chosen reference frame, though any other notation can be used. The positive x-axis in vehicles points always in the direction of movement. For positive y- and z-axis, we have to face two different conventions: * In case of land vehicles like cars, tanks etc., which use the ENU-system (East-North- Up) as external reference (World frame), the vehicle's (body's) positive y- or pitch axis always points to its left, and the positive z- or yaw axis always points up. World frame's origin is fixed at the center of gravity of the vehicle. NavCommand. Software to Operate and Configure iMAR Inertial Measuring and Surveying Systems. Operation and User Instructions. St.Ingbert 2007, str.11‚Äì12. http://www.imar-navigation.de/download/nav_command_en.pdf * By contrast, in case of air and sea vehicles like submarines, ships, airplanes etc., which use the NED-system (North-East-Down) as external reference (World frame), the vehicle's (body's) positive y- or pitch axis always points to its right, and its positive z- or yaw axis always points down. World frame's origin is fixed at the center of gravity of the vehicle. * Finally, in case of space vehicles like space shuttles etc., a modification of the latter convention is used, where the vehicle's (body's) positive y- or pitch axis again always points to its right, and its positive z- or yaw axis always points down, but ‚Äúdown‚Äù now may have two different meanings: If a so-called local frame is used as external reference, its positive z-axis points ‚Äúdown‚Äù to the center of the earth as it does in case of the earlier mentioned NED- system,Exploration: Local Reference Orbiter Attitude (September 18, 1995) (article no more available since 2007) but if the inertial frame is used as reference, its positive z-axis will point now to the North Celestial Pole, and its positive x-axis to the Vernal EquinoxExploration: Inertial Reference Orbiter Attitude (October 3, 1995) (article no more available since 2007) or some other reference meridian. Frames mounted on vehicles Specially for aircraft, these frames do not need to agree with the earth-bound frames in the up-down line. It must be agreed what ENU and NED mean in this context. =Conventions for land vehicles= RPY angles of cars and other land vehicles For land vehicles it is rare to describe their complete orientation, except when speaking about electronic stability control or satellite navigation. In this case, the convention is normally the one of the adjacent drawing, where RPY stands for roll-pitch-yaw. =Conventions for sea vehicles= RPY angles of ships and other sea vehicles As well as aircraft, the same terminology is used for the motion of ships and boats. Some words commonly used were introduced in maritime navigation. For example, the yaw angle or heading, has a nautical origin, with the meaning of \\"bending out of the course\\". Etymologically, it is related with the verb 'to go'.Etymology online dictionary It is related to the concept of bearing. It is typically assigned the shorthand notation . =Conventions for aircraft local reference frames= RPY angles of airplanes and other air vehicles Coordinates to describe an aircraft attitude (Heading, Elevation and Bank) are normally given relative to a reference control frame located in a control tower, and therefore ENU, relative to the position of the control tower on the earth surface. Coordinates to describe observations made from an aircraft are normally given relative to its intrinsic axes, but normally using as positive the coordinate pointing downwards, where the interesting points are located. Therefore, they are normally NED. These axes are normally taken so that X axis is the longitudinal axis pointing ahead, Z axis is the vertical axis pointing downwards, and the Y axis is the lateral one, pointing in such a way that the frame is right-handed. The motion of an aircraft is often described in terms of rotation about these axes, so rotation about the X-axis is called rolling, rotation about the Y-axis is called pitching, and rotation about the Z-axis is called yawing. Frames for space navigation Different reference systems for coordinates in space For satellites orbiting the earth it is normal to use the Equatorial coordinate system. The projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the celestial equator. Similarly, the projections of the Earth's north and south geographic poles become the north and south celestial poles, respectively. Deep space satellites use other Celestial coordinate system, like the Ecliptic coordinate system. Local conventions for space ships as satellites If the goal is to keep the shuttle during its orbits in a constant attitude with respect to the sky, e.g. in order to perform certain astronomical observations, the preferred reference is the inertial frame, and the RPY angle vector (000) describes an attitude then, where the shuttle's wings are kept permanently parallel to the earth's equator, its nose points permanently to the vernal equinox, and its belly towards the northern polar star (see picture). (Note that rockets and missiles more commonly follow the conventions for aircraft where the RPY angle vector (000) points north, rather than toward the vernal equinox). On the other hand, if the goal is to keep the shuttle during its orbits in a constant attitude with respect to the surface of the earth, the preferred reference will be the local frame, with the RPY angle vector (000) describing an attitude where the shuttle's wings are parallel to the earth's surface, its nose points to its heading, and its belly down towards the centre of the earth (see picture). Frames used to describe attitudes Normally the frames used to describe a vehicle's local observations are the same frames used to describe its attitude with respect to the ground tracking stations. i.e. if an ENU frame is used in a tracking station, also ENU frames are used onboard and these frames are also used to refer local observations. An important case in which this does not apply is aircraft. Aircraft observations are performed downwards and therefore normally NED axes convention applies. Nevertheless, when attitudes with respect to ground stations are given, a relationship between the local earth-bound frame and the onboard ENU frame is used.

While many graded reader books are written for native speaker children, more often they are targeted at young adults and above, since children's books are already widely available and deal with topics not relevant to more mature language learners. Graded readers can be adapted from literary classics, films, biographies, travel books, etc., or they can be original works written at a less demanding language level. Although they employ simplified language, graded readers do not necessarily lack narrative depth or avoid complex themes; often, they cover the same range of \\"serious\\" themes as books written for native speaker audiences. Graded readers are written with specific levels of grammatical complexity in mind and with vocabulary that is limited by frequency headword counts. For example, Level 1 in a series might be restricted to 500 headwords, Level 2 to 600 headwords, and Level 3 to 700 headwords. Simple English Wikipedia is designed along similar lines. Other factors taken into consideration when selecting titles to publish, or determining levels, might include the number and range of characters; the complexity of the plot; the expected background of the target audience; compliance requirements for certain markets (regarding e.g., sex, dating, religion, gender roles and sexuality, etc.), among other factors. Graded readers are not to be confused with Basal readers, such as Dick and Jane, which tend to target specific language features, and therefore are more like textbooks in nature.

The main mission of this day-use park is the preservation of the riparian habitat along Oak Creek. Red Rock State Park serves as an environmental education facility for the public and for school or private groups, and provides limited passive recreational opportunities. Natural history Red Rock State Park includes a stretch of Oak Creek, which upstream flows through the famous Oak Creek Canyon in Coconino National Forest. The rich riparian zone along the creek supports a diverse array of species. Trees in this habitat include Fremont cottonwood, Arizona sycamore, velvet ash, and Arizona alder. Oak Creek supports rare native fish, several frog species, and the threatened Sonora mud turtle. Away from the creek the dominant trees are velvet mesquite, netleaf hackberry, Utah juniper, and alligator juniper. Bird species found in the area include the common black hawk, wood duck, and common merganser. Lower Oak Creek, which includes the state park, has been designated an Important Bird Area. Large mammals include the cougar, coyote, mule deer, collared peccary, and river otter. Introduced species found in the park include giant reed, tamarisk, Johnson grass, and tumbleweed. Cultural history Red Rock State Park was previously a part of a ranch, Smoke Trail Ranch. In 1941 it was purchased by Jack Frye, then- president of Trans World Airlines, as a southwestern retreat for himself and his wife Helen. Helen Frye maintained the property for many years after Jack's death in 1959. In the early 1970s she sold to a real estate development company, who planned to build a resort complex. The deal fell through from lack of funds. In 1976 the property was transferred to Eckankar, a new religious movement that Helen Frye belonged to, who planned a private retreat for their members. In the fall on 1980 a group of friends hiking along Oak Creek were informed by an Eckankar representative that they were trespassing on private property. The group happened to include Bruce Babbitt, then- governor of Arizona. Concerned about loss of public access along waterways, Babbitt researched the property and noted its potential for a full-fledged state park. After determining the willingness of all parties involved, Babbitt pursued a three-way land exchange: Eckankar would sell of the Smoke Trail Ranch to Anamax Mining Company, who would donate the land to the state in exchange for of Arizona State Land Department property they had been leasing in Pima County. Since state law only provided for such exchanges within a county, the Arizona Legislature had to pass new legislation allowing trans- county trades. The enabling law and the transfers were completed in 1981. Development was slowed by budget cuts in the following years and a new land exchange with the federal government involving Red Rock and Lake Havasu State Park. Red Rock State Park opened to the public and was dedicated on October 19, 1991. Motion picture Red Rock State Park has been featured in movies such as Rocky Mountain (1950), Fort Defiance (1950), Red Mountain (1951), Escape from Fort Bravo (1953), Fort Massacre (1957), A Distant Trumpet (1963) and The Hallelujah Trail (1965).Maddrey, Joseph (2016).

The disaster occurred during the launching of a new boat: sixty-four people, mainly children were drowned in the river. Events The disaster took place at the launching of the sea-going riverboat the John and William from Chambers' boatyard on the Masbrough side of the River Don. The boat was built for Messrs. Henry and Edward Cadnam of Pitsmoor, Sheffield. On the occasion of the launching of a boat it was common to invite local people to celebrate the launch. Local teachers and schoolchildren came along and a gala was planned. It was customary at this yard to invite people to stand on the boat during the launch to enjoy the rush into the water. Upwards of 100 people (some accounts say 150), mainly children from 11 to 16, were standing upon the boat during the launch. Owing to the narrow river channel, boats at this yard were launched sideways. As the boat slid down the slipway towards the water, the people on board rushed towards the river side of the boat to get a better view of the boat hitting the water. This caused the boat to overbalance on its keel, throwing the people on the deck into the river. The boat landed on top of many of the people who had been thrown into the river, drowning them. Although members of the gathering managed to rescue some, sixty-four people died in the disaster, either instantly, or not long after being retrieved from the river. Fifty of those who died were children. Several families lost two or even three members. The losses cut across social classes. Several of the children who died were the sons of wealthy local businessmen, including sons of both partners of the iron founders Yates Haywood. Indeed, one casualty had just turned 21 and come into significant property. The majority, however, were children of ordinary families of the local area. Aftermath A grand jury was sitting at Rotherham on the day of disaster. This was adjourned after news of the disaster reached them so that the gentlemen sitting on the jury could survey the scene of the disaster. The later coroner's inquest sat at the Angel Inn in Rotherham. They spent the first four hours going from house to house to see the bodies of the dead. After that evidence was heard from various witnesses. The jury found that the disaster was an accident. After the disaster ¬£200 was raised to assist with relieving the poorer bereaved families, and to build a memorial to the dead. Memorials Memorials to the disaster were built next the Walker mausoleum in Masbrough, and in the Rotherham parish church (now Rotherham Minster). The Masbrough memorial along with the mausoleum is now in a state of disrepair and is subject to a local appeal for renovation.

It was nicknamed the 'worthiest jewel of the city' and played a very active role in the inception of the modern Greek Enlightenment movement.Bardu (2007): 2 Background Moscopole, now Voskopoj√´, a small village in south Albania, was an 18th-century city inhabited predominantly by Aromanians. It became a center of Greek culture, with Greek being the language of education in the local schools, as well as the language of the books published by the local printing house, founded either in 1720 or in 1731. Seemingly it was the second printing press founded in the Ottoman Empire, after the also Greek printing press in Istanbul. Education was so actively promoted, that the city emerged as a leading center of Greek intellectual activity. An educational institution, called The Greek College, was active in the city as early as 1700.Lloshi (2008) p.103 Its first director, Chrysanthos, was a monk from Zitsa, while, in 1724, Ioannina born scholar, Nicolaos Stigmis, became schoolmaster.Peyfuss (1976): p. 116 After 1730 and for a short period, Ioannis Chalkeus an Aristotelian philosopher also taught in the school. During that time the teaching staff included scholars from various ethnic backgrounds: Aromanian, Greek and Albanian. History In 1738, Sevastos Leontiadis, a scholar and priest from Kastoria (now Greece), was put in charge.Kekridis (1989): p. 41 It was during his directorate that the school was upgraded and endowed with additional classes. In 1744 the school was named New Academy and in 1750 it was re-housed in a new, imposing building. In accordance to 18th-century Greek educational mores, a school could only acquire the title 'Academy' if it achieved a higher standard of educational quality and prestige.Kekridis (1989): p. 42 Similar educational institutions this period were operating in a number of urban center in the Ottoman Empire: Bucharest, Ia≈üi, Ioannina, Istanbul (Constantinople).Peyfuss (1976): p. 116 It was also alternatively called Ellinikon Frontistirion ( Greek College). In 1750 Theodore Kavalliotis, already a member of the teaching staff since 1743, became the headmaster of the New Academy. Kavalliotis was instrumental in establishing the reputation of the Academy, which, under his direction, reached its floruit.Kekridis (1989): p. 282 Becoming the virtual soul of the Academy, Kavalliotis taught grammar, poetry, philosophical disciplines, and theology. Moreover, with the purpose of meeting class needs, he wrote a number of introductory manuals in Greek, as well as treatises and other material, necessary for teaching, many of which are still preserved in unpublished manuscripts.Bardu (2007): 4-5 Apart from Kavalliotis, another teacher of the New Academy was the owner of the Academy‚Äôs printing press, Gregory Konstantinidis (not to be confused with Gregory of Durr√´s), who was also responsible for the printing of the books that were taught.Peyfuss (1976): p. 117 He taught from 1745 to 1748.Kekridis (1989): p. 44 The printing house had notably close ties to the Monastery of Saint Naum, near Ohrid. Notably 19 publications from Moscopole's printing press, mainly religious ones, appeared after 1760. The last known publication of the press was the Introduction to Grammar by Kavalliotis. Aftermath The New Academy, was destroyed during the first wave of destruction of Moscopole, by Muslim Albanian bands in 1769.Sakellariou (1997): p. 268. Although the city never rose to its former glory, a new Greek school was established at the end of the 18th century whose headmaster at 1802 was Daniel Moscopolites. This school functioned the following decades, thanks to donations and bequests mainly by baron Simon Sinas, a member of the Moscopole diaspora.Sakellariou (1997): p. 308 The school functioned until the 1916 wave of destruction, and his last director was Theophrastos Georgiadis.Kekridis (1989): p. 29 Notable alumni *Daniel Moscopolites *Konstantinos Tzechanis ReferencesSources  * * Further reading * * Category:Education in the Ottoman Empire Category:Modern Greek Enlightenment Category:Moscopole Category:1743 establishments in Europe Category:1769 disestablishments Moscopole Category:1743 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"New Academy (Moscopole)"},{"id":"29120466","text":"is a Japanese actress, voice actress, and narrator who is most famous for the role of Sazae Fuguta from the long-running family anime Sazae-san. She is also known for voicing Yoshiko in Sally the Witch and Osomatsu Matsuno in Osomatsu- kun (1966). Biography=Early life and career Midori Kat≈ç was born on 15 November 1939 in Tokyo Prefecture, which would later become Tokyo Metropolis four years after her birth, in the Empire of Japan.„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÊñáÊò•„Äè2009Âπ¥1Êúà29Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅpp.134-138 She was educated at in Suginami ward and , the now-defunct school of the troupe.Profile at Kouenkai Info She originally wanted to be an actress in shinpa, but she was unable to perform any of the required arts, and she expected that it would change if it was taught at a low price. Several of the students she was in the same graduating class with included actresses Chieko Baisho and . In 1959, the Japanese national broadcasting organization NHK was recruiting tarento for television, and Kat≈ç subsequently moved the NHK's actor training school. The following year in April 1960, she made her broadcast debut in NHK's Tenshi no Heya, and in the same year, she was also the founder of a theatrical troupe called \\"Sanju Jinkai\\". She was also a member of three voice acting offices: the Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society, and Sigma Seven.Profile at Koushihaken After the expiration of her three-year priority contract with NHK, Kat≈ç met a producer at Toei Doga (later Toei Animation) and started her career as a voice actor in anime television. She voiced the titular character of Osomatsu-kun, Yoshiko Hanamura in Sally the Witch, and Kan-chan in The Genie Family. She also performed the song in a commercial for Meiji Milk Chocolate (a chocolate bar manufactured by Meiji Dairies) that is best known for the Chocolate wa Meiji phrase. Sazae-san In 1968, Kat≈ç was cast as the titular character of Sazae-san, Sazae Fuguta. She participated at the audition with the intent to audition for another character, Katsuo Isono, and wanted to voice him and Sazae, but it was vetoed. She was asked to step down from all other anime work, and no longer played any anime characters other than Sazae. Although the series is now long-running, Kat≈ç would later recall in 2009 that she initially thought it would last only three months. For about 10 years since the broadcast started, Kat≈ç played freely and ad libitum, but later decided to use scripts after self-reflecting that the scriptwriters are not actors if they are not writing every word. This was because Kazue Takahashi, who was the second voice actor of Katsuo, was able to do his words perfectly without being affected by Kato's ad libitum acting. During the fifteenth anniversary of Sazae-san around 1984, Kat≈ç had an opportunity to meet the writer of the original Sazae-san manga, Machiko Hasegawa. Kat≈ç told Hasegawa, \\"Sensei, watashi, this year, it's just bad\\", and Hasegawa told her, \\"I'm sure there's something good to come\\". This was the only time Kat≈ç ever met Hasegawa before the latter's death on 27 May 1992. In 2009, Kat≈ç and her Sazae-san co-star Ichir≈ç Nagai made brief cameo appearances in the fourth live-action adaptation of Sazae-san, Kat≈ç appearing as a female employee. Kat≈ç told Oricon Style that she had not appeared in drama for the past 45 years and felt nervous during her appearance. She was invited to the held on 25 October 2012, where she exchanged words with then-Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. Kato introduced herself as \\"Sazae\\", believing that she would be recognized with just the nameplate, and the Emperor and Empress responded with a smile. After the Crown Prince Naruhito and his younger brother the Prince Akishino said that they were watching Sazae-san, Kato said \\"Dad, mom, I'm thrilled, I don't want to go home anymore. Officials from the Imperial Household Agency reported that Aiko, Princess Toshi was able to recognize Kat≈ç's voice as Sazae's.„Ç¢„Éã„É°Â•Ω„ÅçÊÑõÂ≠êÊßò Â£∞ÂÑ™„ÅÆ„Äå„Çµ„Ç∂„Ç®„Åß„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„ÅæÔΩû„Åô„ÄçËÅû„Åã„Çå„Çã, Josei Seven In 2013 Guinness World Records recognized Sazae-san as the longest running animated series, surpassing The Simpsons which went on air in 1989.

Charles was the son of Jean Delorme (a professor at Montpellier University), who was the primary doctor to Marie de' Medici. This ultimately opened doors for Charles' medical career soon after he graduated from the University of Montpellier in 1607 at the age of 23. He first came to Paris after graduation to practice medicine under the watchful eye of his father, until he was ready to practice as a regular doctor on his own. There are no records of his marriages, except that he married for the third time at the age of 78. This wife died within a year.Astruc, p. 363 Charles was the personal physician to several members of the royal family of the House of Medici from 1610 to 1650. He was the main doctor to Louis the Just after his father retired and additionally became the primary physician to the king's brother Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans starting in 1629.Tibayrenc, pp. 680‚Äì681.

A special journal, \\"La Chronique Medicale,\\" informs us that in the seventeenth century a physician named Charles de Lorme was attached to the person of three kings‚Äî Henri IV, Louis XIII, and Louis XIV. This physician enjoyed great renown and he owed this to his essays. He was very reputable in his profession as a doctor.Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology, Volume 1 By Joseph Thomas He acquired the friendship of Cardinal Richelieu and Chancellor Pierre S√©guier, who granted him a pension.  Biography  One biography describes him as having nice features including a good complexion, and a strong distinct voice. He also had an excellent volubility of language, elegant ease of speech, and a good memory. He was generally open-minded, had a great wit, and spoke with authority. Charles claims he was a direct descendant of Jacques de L'Orme, one of those who worked on the reform of the Custom of Bourbonnais.Bernardin, pp. 1‚Äì2 Through his father's influence, a professor at the University of Montpellier, he learned Latin, Greek, Spanish and Italian. He also influenced Charles' education in the medical field. Charles did nine theses while he was a student at the University of Montpellier. They were in Latin and Greek and were published and sold in Paris in 1608.Bernardin, pp. 3‚Äì7 The following are some of these theses. * Convient-il d'employer les m√™mes rem√®des avec les amants qu'avec les d√©ments? *: Should one use the same remedies for lovers as are used for the insane? * Une fi√®vre pestilente peut-elle √™tre intermittente? *: Can pestilential fever be intermittent? * La guimauve est-elle un √™tre vivant, et a-t-elle les propri√©t√©s que lui accordent Dioscoride et Galien ? *: Is the althaea officinalis a living being, and does it have the properties which Pedanius Dioscorides and Galen ascribe to it? The following were four theses, dedicated to the Chancellor de Sillery, that Charles wrote after October 30, 1607. * La vie des rois, des princes et des grands est-elle moins expos√©e √† la maladie et plus longue que telle des gens du peuple et des paysans? *: Are the lives of kings, princes and great men less exposed to disease and longer than common people and peasants? * Les v√©sicants sont-ils bons pour les douleurs arthritiques? *: Are blister-causing agents good for arthritis pain? * Peut-on pr√©parer un poison qui tue √† une √©poque d√©termin√©e? *: Can one prepare a poison that kills at a certain time? * Est-il permis, quand une femme enceinte souffre d'une maladie aigu√´, de lui prescrire des abortifs? *: Is it permissible, when a pregnant woman suffers from an acute illness, to prescribe her an abortion? De Lorme is credited with the invention of the medico della peste costume worn by plague doctors in Europe's lazarettos in the 17th century. The costume included a beak filled with perfumes and hat and vestments made of Levantine leather, all intended to prevent a doctor from becoming ill with bubonic plague when visiting sick patients in quarantine.\\"Plague Doctor\\", Piece of the Month, Museo de Sanidad, Madrid. Mineral baths and spas Jean de Lorme, Charles' father, was one of two doctors from Moulins that introduced Bourbon-Lancy as a spa town to Europe. Charles was the heir to his father's interest in the spa town, however for some unknown reason promoted the rival spa town of Bourbon-l'Archambault. Charles profited hugely from promoting the spa in this town. He was accused with the proverb d'avoir pris pension des habitants pour y faire aller bien du monde (\\"to have boarded the inhabitants in order to make the world go well\\") because of his enthusiasm for this rival spa. Charles gave the spa of Bourbon-l'Archambault its excellent reputation in the European upper class.  Antimony  Charles became wealthy in a medical practice of prescribing a concoction of antimony to Henry IV, Louis XIII, Cardinal Mazarin, and Madame de S√©vign√© as a health-preserving, health-restoring and life extending preparation.Sneader, p. 57 This concept was originally started by Basil Valentine in his work Currus Triumphalis Antimonii (\\"The triumphal chariot of antimony\\"); who obtained the idea of medical benefits from Paracelsus (1480‚Äì1541). Charles claimed \\"qui plus en boira, plus il vivra\\" (He who drinks more will live more). Some of the patients to whom he prescribed this concoction were Guez de Balzac, who lived to the age of 70, Nicolas Boileau- Despr√©aux, who lived to the age of 75, and Daniel Huet, who lived to the age of 91.

The artwork was published in magazines or sold as watercolor paintings, rather than included in an edition of the novels. Early life and family life He was born in Peel on the Isle of Man in 1856 or 1857, the son of Lauris and Eliza Clark. In 1889 he married Agnes Roberts (born 1872), and their children were David (born 1891), Dora (born 1891), Constance (born 1893), Grace (born 1895), Josephine (born 1897), Rose (born 1898), Joseph Cecil (1900‚Äì1989), Cecil William (1900‚Äì1989), Alice Ivy (1906‚Äì1927), and Joseph (born 1911). Around 1892, Clark moved with his family to Chichester in West Sussex. Career Wilkins Micawber from David Copperfield Clark had many occupations during his lifetime, including designer of cigarette cards and postcards, and as a fore-edge painter principally specializing in characters from the works of Charles Dickens. He worked for Punch for only one day and then as a freelance artist until 1900. Clark's illustrations from Dickens first appeared in 1887 in Fleet Street Magazine, with two published collections appearing shortly after as The Characters of Charles Dickens (1889) and Some Well Known Characters from the Works of Charles Dickens (1892). Early in the twentieth century five sets of postcards based on his Dickens drawings were published, as well as seven sets of non- Dickensian comic cards. From 1927 Clark earned his living from watercolor sketches, mainly of Dickens' characters, which he sold to and through the London book trade. Frederic G. Kitton referred to Clark in his book Dickens and His Illustrators (1890), by which time Clark's watercolors were already being bought by major Dickens collectors.Kitton, Frederic G.

Marxism analyzes and critiques the development of class society and especially of capitalism as well as the role of class struggles in systemic economic, social and political change. It frames capitalism through a paradigm of exploitation and analyzes class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development (now known as \\"historical materialism\\") - materialist in the sense that the politics and ideas of an epoch are determined by the way in which material production is carried on. From the late 19th century onward, Marxism has developed from Marx's original revolutionary critique of classical political economy and materialist conception of history into a comprehensive world-view. There are now many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory. Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Some schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and its offshoots are the most well-known Marxist schools of thought as they were a driving force in international relations during most of the 20th century.  Marxism  Karl Marx Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain social phenomena within any given society. It assumes that the form of economic organization, or mode of production, influences all other social phenomena‚Äîincluding wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a base and superstructure. As forces of production improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As Karl Marx observed: \\"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or‚Äîthis merely expresses the same thing in legal terms‚Äîwith the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution\\".A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859). Introduction. These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of the class struggle.Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. Marx's Theory of Change. . Friedrich Engels Under the capitalist mode of production, this struggle materializes between the minority (the bourgeoisie) who own the means of production and the vast majority of the population (the proletariat) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that social change occurs because of the struggle between different classes within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that capitalism exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a proletarian revolution. In a socialist society, private property‚Äîin the form of the means of production‚Äîwould be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs‚Äîthat is, production would be carried out directly for use. As Friedrich Engels said: \\"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\\".Socialism, Utopian and Scientific (1882). Chapter three. Marxian economics and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for falling rates of profit by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The socialist system would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' revolution. According to Marxian crisis theory, socialism is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \\"Men make their own history\\". The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). Classical Marxism is the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by Marx and Engels as contrasted with later developments in Marxism, especially Leninism and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Orthodox Marxism is the body of Marxism thought that emerged after the death of Marx and which became the official philosophy of the socialist movement as represented in the Second International until World War I in 1914. Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the productive forces) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. feudalism, capitalism and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new economic systems. As a term, orthodox Marxism represents the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.Luk√°cs, Georg. What is Orthodox Marxism?. Marxism Internet Archive (1919): \\"What is Orthodox Marxism?\\". \\"Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the 'belief' in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a 'sacred' book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method.\\"  Leninism  Vladimir Lenin Leninism is the body of political theory developed by and named after the Russian revolutionary and later Soviet premier Vladimir Lenin for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat as political prelude to the establishment of socialism. Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early 20th-century Russian Empire. Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class. In 1903, Lenin stated: > We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better > society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a > handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of > their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the > work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions > and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called > socialist society. The teachings about this society are called > 'socialism'.\\"To the Rural Poor\\" (1903). Collected Works. vol. 6. p. 366. The most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat‚Äîas is traditional to Marxism‚Äîare the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \\"Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!\\" The other distinguishing characteristic of Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the social democratic parties of the time, a loose, multi-tendency organization, was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of democratic centralism.  Left communism  Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first two congresses. Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, Rosa Luxemburg has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek, Otto R√ºhle, Karl Korsch, Amadeo Bordiga and Paul Mattick. Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.  Council communism  Council communism is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both libertarian Marxism and libertarian socialism. In contrast to social democracy and Leninism, the central argument of council communism is that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the reformist and the revolutionary Leninist ideologies, with their stress on respectively parliaments and institutional government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and vanguard parties and participative democratic centralism on the other). The core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by workers' councils composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run authoritarian state socialism/state capitalism. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.  Trotskyism  Leon Trotsky Trotskyism is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist Leon Trotsky, a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Opposed to Stalinism, Trotskyism supports the theory of permanent revolution and world revolution instead of the two stage theory and socialism in one country. It supported proletarian internationalism and another communist revolution in the Soviet Union which Trotsky claimed had become a degenerated worker's state under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the dictatorship of the proletariat. Struggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the Left Opposition and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the Fourth International, a Trotskyist rival to the Communist International. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders. Trotsky's followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist‚ÄìLeninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought‚Äîforemost is the theory of permanent revolution. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own bourgeois-democratic revolutions. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. With power in its hands, the proletariat would then continue this revolution permanently, transforming it from a national bourgeois revolution to a socialist international revolution. Another shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and subsequently from the Soviet Union. As a consequence, Trotsky defined the Soviet Union under Stalin as a planned economy ruled over by a bureaucratic caste. Trotsky advocated overthrowing the government of the Soviet Union after he was expelled from it.  Marxism‚ÄìLeninism  Joseph Stalin Marxism‚ÄìLeninism is a political ideology developed by Joseph Stalin which according to its proponents is based in Marxism and Leninism.Lisichkin, G. (1989). \\"Mify i real'nost'\\" . Novy Mir (3): 59. The term describes the specific political ideology which Stalin implemented in the Soviet Union and in a global scale in the Comintern. There is no definite agreement between historians of about whether Stalin actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin.Butenko, Aleksandr (1996). \\"Sotsializm segodnya: opyt i novaya teoriya\\" . Zhurnal Al'ternativy (1): 2‚Äì22. It also contains aspects which according to some are deviations from Marxism such as socialism in one country.Contemporary Marxism, issues 4‚Äì5. Synthesis Publications, 1981. p. 151. \\"[S]ocialism in one country, a pragmatic deviation from classical Marxism\\".Erik, Cornell (2002). North Korea Under Communism: Report of an Envoy to Paradise. Routledge. p. 169. \\"Socialism in one country, a slogan that aroused protests as not only it implied a major deviation from Marxist internationalism, but was also strictly speaking incompatible with the basic tenets of Marxism\\". Marxism‚ÄìLeninism was the ideology of the most clearly visible communist movement and is the most prominent ideology associated with communism. It refers to the socioeconomic system and political ideology implemented by Stalin in the Soviet Union and later copied by other states based on the Soviet model (central planning, collectivization of agriculture, communist party-led state, rapid industrialization, nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy and the theory of socialism in one country)Andrain, Charles F. (1994). Comparative Political Systems: Policy Performance and Social Change. Armonk, New York: M. E. Sharpe. p. 140. whereas Stalinism refers to Stalin's style of governance (cult of personality and a totalitarian state).Isaac Deutscher, Isaac. (1961). Stalin: A Polityical Biography (2nd ed.). Chapters 7‚Äì9.Plamper, Jan. (2012). The Stalin Cult: A Study in the Alchemy of Power. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism was the official state ideology of the Soviet Union and the other ruling parties making up the Eastern Bloc as well as the parties of the Communist International after Bolshevization. Today, Marxism‚ÄìLeninism is the ideology of several parties around the world and remains the official ideology of the ruling parties of China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam.Cooke, Chris, ed. (1998). Dictionary of Historical Terms (2nd ed.). pp. 221‚Äì222, 305. At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev made several ideological ruptures with his predecessor, Joseph Stalin. First, Khrushchev denounced the cult of personality that had developed around Stalin, although Khrushchev himself had a pivotal role in fostering decades earlier. Khrushchev rejected the heretofore orthodox Marxist‚ÄìLeninist tenet that class struggle continues even under socialism, but rather the state ought to rule in the name of all classes. A related principle that flowed from the former was the notion of peaceful coexistence, or that the newly emergent socialist bloc could peacefully compete with the capitalist world, solely by developing the productive forces of society. Anti-revisionism is a faction within Marxist‚ÄìLeninism that rejects Khrushchev's theses. This school of thought holds that Khrushchev was unacceptably altering or revising the fundamental tenets of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, a stance from which the label anti-revisionist is derived. Maoism takes its name from Mao Zedong, the former leader of the People's Republic of China. It is the variety of anti-revisionism that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the dictatorship of the proletariat, it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for socialist revolution called protracted people's war in what he termed the semi-feudal countries of the Third World and that relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics which he called contradictions. Hoxhaism, so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman Enver Hoxha, was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but it grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called Three Worlds Theory put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that socialism had never existed in China at all.  Maoism  Mao Zedong Maoism () is the theory that Mao Zedong developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the Republic of China and later the People's Republic of China. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism is that the peasantry are the revolutionary vanguard in pre- industrial societies rather than the proletariat. This updating and adaptation of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism‚ÄìLeninism adapted to pre-industrial China. The claim that Mao had adapted Marxism‚ÄìLeninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole.Lenman, B. P.; Anderson, T., eds. (2000). Chambers Dictionary of World History. p. 769. From the 1950s until the Chinese economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, Maoism was the political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China and of Maoist revolutionary movements throughout the world. After the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union claimed to be the sole heir and successor to Joseph Stalin concerning the correct interpretation of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and ideological leader of world communism. In the late 1970s, the Peruvian communist party Shining Path developed and synthesized Maoism into Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMaoism, a contemporary variety of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism that is a supposed higher level of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism that can be applied universally.Bullock, Allan; Trombley, Stephen, eds. (1999). The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought (3rd ed.). p. 501.  Libertarian Marxism  Libertarian Marxism is a broad range of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism,Pierce, Wayne.Libertarian Marxism's Relation to Anarchism. \\"The Utopian\\". 73‚Äì80. emerged in opposition to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and its derivatives, such as Stalinism, Maoism and Trotskyism.Marot, Eric. \\"Trotsky, the Left Opposition and the Rise of Stalinism: Theory and Practice\\". Libertarian Marxism is also critical of reformist positions, such as those held by social democrats.The Retreat of Social Democracy ... Re-imposition of Work in Britain and the 'Social Europe'. Aufheben. Issue No. 8. 1999. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France,Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian Communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007. emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation. Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.Chomsky, Noam. \\"Government In The Future\\" Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture. Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as autonomism, workerism council communism, left communism, Lettrism, Luxemburgism, the Johnson-Forest tendency, the New Left, Situationism, Socialisme ou Barbarie, world socialism and workerism. Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on anarchism, especially post-left and social anarchists. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, Raya Dunayevskaya, C. L. R. James, Antonio Negri, Cornelius Castoriadis, Maurice Brinton, Guy Debord, Daniel Gu√©rin, Ernesto Screpanti and Raoul Vaneigem.  Western Marxism  Western Marxism is a current of Marxist theory that arose from Western and Central Europe in the aftermath of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia and the ascent of Leninism. The term denotes a loose collection of Marxist theorists who emphasised culture, philosophy and art, in contrast to the Marxism of the Soviet Union.  Key Western Marxists  Georg Luk√°cs = Georg Luk√°cs (13 April 1885 ‚Äì 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic, who founded Western Marxism with his magnum opus History and Class Consciousness. Written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923, the collection of essays contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy. The book also reconstructed aspects of Marx's theory of alienation before the publication of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, in which Marx most clearly expounds the theory. Luk√°cs's work underlines Marxism's origins in Hegelianism and elaborates Marxist theories such as ideology, false consciousness, reification and class consciousness. = Karl Korsch = Karl Korsch (15 August 1886 ‚Äì 21 October 1961) was born in Tostedt, near Hamburg, to the family of a middle-ranking bank official. His masterwork Marxism and Philosophy, which attempts to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, earned him condemnation from the Third International. Korsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity‚Äîin the words of the day, becoming \\"vulgarized\\"‚Äîwithin the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. In his later work, he rejected Orthodox Marxism as historically outmoded, wanting to adapt Marxism to a new historical situation. He wrote in his Ten Theses (1950) that \\"the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction\\" and that \\"today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias\\".Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism Today = Antonio Gramsci = Antonio Gramsci (22 January 189127 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the Communist Party of Italy. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment by the Italian Fascist regime. These writings, known as the Prison Notebooks, contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, critical theory and educational theory associated with his name such as: * Cultural hegemony as a means of maintaining the state in a capitalist society * The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class * The distinction between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and civil society (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent * \\"Absolute historicism\\" * The critique of economic determinism * The critique of philosophical materialism = Herbert Marcuse = Herbert Marcuse (19 July 1898 ‚Äì 29 July 1979) was a prominent German- American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School. Marcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and Freud, Eros and Civilization and his 1964 book One- Dimensional Man) resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as \\"the father of the New Left\\", a term he disliked and rejected. = Jean-Paul Sartre = Jean-Paul Sartre (21 June 1905 ‚Äì 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on individualistic existentialism. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of S√∏ren Kierkegaard with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work Critique of Dialectical Reason. Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, calling him \\"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\\". = Louis Althusser = Louis Althusser (16 October 1918 ‚Äì 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a longtime member and sometimes strong critic of the French Communist Party. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory and humanism and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism. His essay Marxism and Humanism is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like \\"human potential\\" and \\"species-being\\", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of \\"humanity\\". His essay Contradiction and Overdetermination borrows the concept of overdetermination from psychoanalysis in order to replace the idea of \\"contradiction\\" with a more complex model of multiple causality in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of hegemony). Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation. The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on Sigmund Freud's and Jacques Lacan's concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.  Structural Marxism  Structural Marxism is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.  Neo-Marxism  Neo-Marxism is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of Friedrich Engels, which focused on dialectical idealism rather than dialectical materialism. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more libertarian. Neo-Marxism adds Max Weber's broader understanding of social inequality, such as status and power, to orthodox Marxist thought.  Frankfurt School  The Frankfurt School is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the Institute for Social Research (Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung) of the University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The term \\"Frankfurt School\\" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them‚Äîit is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves. The Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after World War I and by the rise of Nazism in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions. Max Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in Herbert Marcuse's Freudo-Marxist synthesis in the 1954 work Eros and Civilization). Their emphasis on the \\"critical\\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism, crude materialism and phenomenology by returning to Immanuel Kant's critical philosophy and its successors in German idealism, principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on negation and contradiction as inherent properties of reality.  Marxist feminism  Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that private property, which gives rise to economic inequality as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression. According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations‚Äîthat is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production. Gender oppression is class oppression and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like racism) because it serves the interests of capital and the ruling class. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as wage work in order to support their position.  Marxist humanism  Marxist humanism is a branch of Marxism that primarily focuses on Marx's earlier writings, especially the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 in which Marx develops his theory of alienation, as opposed to his later works, which are considered to be concerned more with his structural conception of capitalist society. It was opposed by Louis Althusser's \\"antihumanism\\", who qualified it as a revisionist movement. Marxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue‚Äîthe Manuscripts of 1844 were published only in 1932. They stress that there is continuity between these early writings and the economic theory of Marx's Capital and that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to properly understand his later works.  Marxist theology  Although Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized religion including Christianity, some Christians have \\"accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective\\". Some of the resulting examples are some forms of liberation theology and black theology. Pope Benedict XVI strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican condemning acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian James H. Cone wrote in his book For My People that \\"for analyzing the structure of capitalism. Marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality, and thereby help Christians to see how things really are\\".  Autonomist Marxism  Autonomism is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties. Autonomist Marxists, including Harry Cleaver, broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework‚Äîit focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a 21st century empire.  Analytical Marxism  Analytical Marxism refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent among a half-dozen analytically trained English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the September Group of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself \\"Non-Bullshit Marxism\\". In the words of David Miller, it was characterized by \\"clear and rigorous thinking about questions that are usually blanketed by ideological fog\\".  British Marxist historians  The British Marxist historians were a circle of scholars that originated in the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1930s, eventually forming the Communist Party Historians Group in 1946. They shared a common interest in \\"history from below\\" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included Maurice Dobb, Dona Torr, A. L. Morton, Rodney Hilton, E. P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm, George Rud√©, Christopher Hill, Dorothy Thompson, John Saville, Victor Kiernan and Raphael Samuel. While some members of the group (most notably E.P. Thompson) left the party after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed great emphasis on human agency, cultural experience and the subjective determination of history, while growing increasingly distant from determinist views of materialism. E. P. Thompson famously engaged Louis Althusser in The Poverty of Theory,Thompson, E. P., (1978). The Poverty of Theory & other essays Merlin, 1978. . arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.  Austro-Marxism  Austro- Marxism was a school of Marxist thought centered in Vienna that existed from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1930s. Its most eminent proponents were Max Adler, Otto Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding and Karl Renner. It was influenced by contemporaneous intellectual trends, including the prominence of neo-Kantianism and positivism in philosophy and the emergence of marginalism in economics. The group confronted issues such as the problem of the National Question within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the rise of the interventionist state and the changing class-structure of early 20th century capitalist societies.  Praxis School  The Praxis school was a dissident Marxist humanist philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by Western Marxism. It originated in Zagreb and Belgrade in the SFR Yugoslavia, during the 1960s. Prominent figures among the school's founders include Gajo Petroviƒá and Milan Kangrga of Zagreb and Mihailo Markoviƒá of Belgrade. From 1964 to 1974 they published the Marxist journal Praxis, which was renowned as one of the leading international journals in Marxist theory. The group also organized the widely popular Korƒçula Summer School in the island of Korƒçula.  De Leonism  De Leonism is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by Daniel De Leon. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party of America which exists to the present day. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against democratic socialist movements‚Äîespecially the Socialist Party of America‚Äîand consider them to be reformist or bourgeois socialist. De Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like social justice movements.  Eurocommunism  Beginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe such as the Italian Communist Party under Enrico Berlinguer and the Communist Party of Spain under Santiago Carrillo tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name Eurocommunism was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.Kingsley, Richard, ed. (1981). In Search of Eurocommunism. Macmillan.  Post-Marxism  Post-Marxism represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure. Marxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as \\"Marxism\\". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the Classic Maya collapse (c. 900 A.D.) ‚Äì without mentioning Marxism by name.

It was built for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, carrying that railroad's number 25. The locomotive is named in honor of its builder, William Mason, who built around 754 steam locomotives at his Mason Machine Works firm in Taunton, Massachusetts, from 1853 until his death in 1883. The engine had been one of the oldest operable examples of the American Standard design, and is the fourth oldest Baltimore and Ohio locomotive in existence, the oldest being the 0-4-0 no. 2, the Andrew Jackson from 1836, second oldest is the no. 8 0-4-0, John Hancock built later that same year, and the third being the 0-8-0 no. 57, Memnon of 1848 (The preserved Tom Thumb and Lafayette engines are replicas built by the road for exhibition purposes in 1926 and 1927, respectively). While operable, William Mason had been one of the oldest operational locomotive in the world, and the second oldest in the western hemisphere, after Robert Stephenson's 1831 John Bull built in 1831 for the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which is the world's oldest surviving operable steam locomotive.  History and career  The engine was built by William Mason for the Baltimore and Ohio in 1856, most likely for passenger service. The engine, while not given a name (the road had ended the practice of naming locomotives at the time no. 25 was built), was the road's second engine to be numbered 25, replacing an earlier 4-4-0 of that number built by William Norris in 1839. Among the engine's notable features is the \\"three-point suspension,\\" where unlike most earlier locomotives (i.e. the road's Lafayette), which the front bogie has its wheels closely spaced, the number 25's bogie had its wheels spread apart, with the cylinder mounted horizontally between them. While the engine was not the first to have this design, it represented a major improvement in locomotive design which would come to define the \\"American Standard\\" locomotive. Another, similarly revolutionary design was the engine's smokebox. Unlike earlier designs, such as that of the General, built a year earlier, the number 25 had its smokebox sitting on a \\"saddle\\" which carried the cylinders. This design further lowered the engine's center of gravity and made re-boilering easier. The number 25 was the road's first engine to have this smokebox design, as well as the road's first engine to have Stephenson link motion valve gear.  Retirement and exhibition William Mason on display between Best Friend of Charleston and a Pennsylvania Railroad K4 streamliner at the 1939 New York World's Fair The number 25 served on the Baltimore and Ohio for nearly forty years. The locomotive is one of the engines that pulled the train which carried Abraham Lincoln from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington, D.C., for his inauguration in 1861.A picture of the engine with this information is on display at the Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee. It was renumbered to 55 in 1882 and was retired in 1892 when it was placed in storage. Fortunately, the Baltimore and Ohio had greatly favored its locomotives, and preserved its best examples, including number 25. The engine was displayed at the Chicago's World Fair of 1893, then at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904. In 1927, the number 25 was given the name William Mason in honor of its builder, and was exhibited at the railroad's own Fair of the Iron Horse, then at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and finally in 1948 at the Chicago Railroad Fair. During 1951, the engine was loaned to the Erie Railroad, operating as a traveling exhibit as part of the railroad's centennial celebration. When not being exhibited, it remained in storage until 1953, when it was placed on display in the newly opened Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum, where it currently remains. William Mason in film Typically, when a locomotive is placed in a museum, it becomes a static exhibit there, often never to operate again. Such was not the case with the William Mason. It had remained operable during the 1950s, when it was used in movies, most notably The Great Locomotive Chase in 1956, and Raintree County a year later. After these performances it returned to the museum, seemingly never to operate again. However, in 1998, the locomotive was restored once more to operating condition for use in the movie, Wild Wild West. After that, it continued to appear in films such as Tuck Everlasting and Gods and Generals. In February 2003, the roof of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum's roundhouse, where the William Mason was usually displayed, had collapsed from a major snowstorm. While many engines and rolling stock sustained considerable damage from the collapse, the William Mason was not in the roundhouse at the time, having been removed for inspection by the Federal Railroad Administration, and thus escaped damage. Current Status In November 2004, after the roundhouse was rebuilt, the museum reopened, with the William Mason returning to display in the roundhouse shortly thereafter. The museum operated the William Mason on select weekends in October until 2014 - after which the engine was taken out of service for its 1472-day inspection. During the inspection, it was found that the engine's firebox crown sheet would have to be replaced for the engine to continue to operate, the cost of which exceeded the budget allocated for the engine's restoration.http://www.rypn.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t;=41147&p;=266276#p266276http://www.railpictures.net/photo/610211/ Thus, the museum instead opted for a cosmetic restoration, with the engine receiving a new livery of green (a different shade from that worn post-1999) with red and gold lining. This livery, based on the layers of paint uncovered from the engine during restoration, is believed to be closer to that originally worn by the engine. The restored engine was returned to display in the roundhouse in September, 2017.http://www.borail.org/William-Mason- Restored.aspx  References External links *William Mason Information Page Category:Individual locomotives of the United States Category:Baltimore and Ohio locomotives Category:4-4-0 locomotives Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1856 ","title":"William Mason (locomotive)"},{"id":"29120729","text":"Koyunbaba statue in Osmancƒ±k, √áorum Province, Turkey.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn. There has been a church on the site since no later than the 12th century although the present building mostly dates from the 16th century. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History A church has existed on the site from no later than the 12th century and was possibly founded by Robert de Lacy. The present building mostly dates from the early 16th century although there are traces from the late 12th or early 13th century in the north arcade of the nave. The building probably underwent significant restoration in the 16th century. A font was donated to the church by Lawrence Towneley in 1590. In 1815, repairs were made to the north arcade by Thomas Taylor. The building underwent restoration by E. G. Paley in 1856‚Äì57, and a further restoration in 1889‚Äì91 by Paley, Austin and Paley. In the latter restoration the north aisle was removed and replaced by a double aisle, an organ chamber and vestries were added, the church was reseated, and screens, choir stalls, a pulpit and an altar were added; this restoration cost nearly ¬£7,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). In 1988 the church was designated a Grade I listed building. The Grade I listing is for buildings \\"of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed of wrought stone in the Perpendicular and Late Perpendicular styles. Its plan consists of a nave with a south and a double north aisle, a chancel, chapels to the north and south of the chancel, vestries, an organ chamber and a tower to the west. There is a porch to the south. The south windows are straight-headed with four arched lights; the clerestory has three-light windows. The five-light east window has cinquefoil heads and rectilinear tracery. The north aisle has two- and three-light windows. The tower is high. It has square buttresses of four stages at the western corners. The three-light belfry windows are pointed and transomed, with tracery in their heads. The tower parapet is crenellated with gargoyles below, to the north and south. The doorway to the tower has a pointed head. The porch to the south has a niche in its gable, and a sundial in place of a finial. Its entrance has a pointed arch and chamfered orders. Inside there is a stone bench on either side of the entrance. Interior and fittings The 16th century baptismal font The nave measures by . The north and south arcades have four bays; the north has round piers with moulded bases and capitals and the south has octagonal columns, also with moulded bases and capitals. There is an inner and an outer aisle to the north, separated from each other by an arcade of four pointed arches and octagonal piers. The font is octagonal with concave sides, each featuring a shield. The shields contain symbols of the Passion and the initials of Lawrence Towneley. The pulpit is constructed of oak on a stone base. The chancel measures by . It has a narrow opening into the north aisle. Its arcades to the north and south have octagonal piers and three pointed arches of two chamfered orders. The Banastre chapel to the north, and the Barnside chapel to the south, are both separated from the aisles by oak screens. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Six of them date from 1814, cast by Thomas Mears of London. The remaining two were given to the church in 1900 by Thomas Hyde of Colne. Churchyard The churchyard lies mostly to the south of the church. The oldest dated gravestone is from 1606. There is a medieval stone cross to the south-east of the building. It consists of a square block topped with an octagonal shaft and an octagonal block. The cross has a Grade II listing.

Georgy Andreyevich Baklanoff, known as Georges Baklanoff (sometimes spelled Baklanov; 6 December 1938) was a Russian operatic baritone who had an active international career from 1903 until his death in 1938. Possessing a powerful and flexible voice, he sang roles from a wide variety of musical periods and in many languages. He was also highly praised by audience and critics for his acting abilities. Baklanoff's early career was spent performing with major theatres in Russia; including the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theatres. In 1910 he began performing with important opera houses internationally, and became a member of both the Boston Opera Company (1910-1915) and the Vienna State Opera (1912-1914). From 1917-1928 he was the leading baritone in Chicago and in 1928-1929 he was a member of the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company. From 1932 until his death in 1938 he was a member of Theatre Basel. He also appeared as a guest artist with important theatres internationally. Early life, education, and career in Russia Baklanoff was born Alfons-Georg Bakkis in Riga, Latvia. In 1892 he moved to Kiev after the death of his parents. He initially planned to pursue a career as a lawyer, and studied law at both Kiev University and Saint Petersburg State University. His studies were interrupted due to financial difficulties resulting from the theft of his assets by his legal guardian; a man who eventually committed suicide. He then entered the Kiev Conservatory, and after graduating studied singing for two more years in St. Petersburg with the Russian tenor Ippolit Pryanishnikov. He pursued further training in Milan, Italy in 1902 with Vittorio Vanza. Baklanoff made his professional opera debut in 1903 in Kiev in the title role of Anton Rubinstein's The Demon. That same year he joined the newly formed Zimin Opera. In 1905 he became a member artist at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow where he notably created the title role in the world premiere of Sergei Rachmaninoff's The Miserly Knight and Lanciotto Malatesta in Rachmaninoff's Francesca da Rimini on 24 January 1906.Steve Griffiths, Review of vocal scores of Rachmaninoff's Francesca da Rimini and The Miserly Knight. Musical Times, 136(1825), 148 (1995). From 1907-1909 he was committed to the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. There he sang the role of Fyodor Poyarok in the Moscow premiere of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya. Rise to international success In 1910 Baklanoff made debuts with three important companies, the Boston Opera Company (as The Miserly Knight), the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (as Verdi's Rigoletto), and the Royal Opera House in London (as Rigoletto and Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca). Although he never again performed at the Met, he returned frequently to Boston for performances up through 1915. In 1911 he sang Rigoletto for his debut at the Komische Oper Berlin and the title role in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin for his first performance in France at the Th√©√¢tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris. He was soon after engaged as a guest artist at the Paris Opera, the Frankfurt Opera, and with theatres in South America. From 1912-1916 he was a member of the Vienna State Opera. In 1914 he sang in the posthumous world premiere of Amilcare Ponchielli's I Mori di Valenza at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. Career in Chicago and Philadelphia left From 1917-1921 Baklanoff sang with the Chicago Opera Association and from 1922-1928 he performed with the Chicago Civic Opera. In Chicago he sang in the United States premieres of Henry F√©vrier's Monna Vanna (1918), Xavier Leroux's Le chemineau (1919, title role), and Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden (1923); all at the Chicago Auditorium.

The limestone ossuary measures c. high by long and is housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.The Ossuary of Joseph Caiaphas, K. C. Hanson's HomePage It has been suggested that it belonged to Joseph, son of Caiaphas, known as the High Priest of Israel Caiaphas in the New Testament. This identification is disputed. According to the Canonical gospels, Caiaphas was the major antagonist of Jesus. It should be distinguished from the less ornate Miriam ossuary, which came to light in June 2011. The latter is a looted, though authenticated artifact from the Valley of Elah, bearing the inscription: \\"Miriam daughter of Yeshua son of Caiapha, priest of Ma‚Äôazya from Beit Imri\\". The chamber tomb was discovered by construction workers in November 1990. It was located in the Peace Forest, near the North Talpiot neighborhood.Zvi Greenhut, 01-Jan-2004, Discovery of the Caiaphas Family Tomb The workers' superintendent reported it to the Israel Antiquities Authority after the tomb‚Äôs roof was opened by a bulldozer, to reveal the rock-hewn loculi burial cave. The burial was typical of the Second Temple period (516 BCE and 70 CE) in Jerusalem, and one of many in the Jerusalem necropolis which may be encountered as far south as the Arab village of Sur Baher. The four cave niches contained twelve ossuaries, of which six had been disturbed by grave robbers.Time Magazine, 24 Aug. 1992, Caiaphas' Cave One very ornate ossuary contained the bones of two infants, two teenage boys, an adult woman and a man of about 60. Besides the detailed etching, there were traces of bright orange paint. It was inscribed \\"Yehosef bar Qayafa\\" on the long side,The Caiaphas Ossuary (1st Century CE): View and Inscription. University of Minnesota and \\"Yehosef bar Qafa\\" on the narrow side. The bones were eventually reburied on the Mount of Olives. Background  Christ before Caiaphas The High Priest is depicted tearing his robe in righteous indignation at Jesus' perceived blasphemy - Cappella Scrovegni a Padova, Giotto di Bondone, Life of Christ Caiaphas is generally accepted, even by otherwise skeptical scholars, as an historical figure.\\"And Caiaphas is an historic personality, known and named as such by Flavius Josephus, which cannot be said of Jesus, as the forged passage in the \\"Antiquities of the Jews\\" (18:63) long ago has been recognized as such by even the most conservative students.\\" Georg Brandes, Jesus: A Myth, trans. Edwin Bj√∂rkman (New York: Albert and Charles Boni, 1926), p. 46. According to The New York Times and a number of Biblical scholars, if authentic and attributable to high priest Caiaphas, the ossuary is an important confirmation of the New Testament account, and facilitates understanding of the historical Jesus.VanderKam, James C. From Joshua to Caiaphas: high priests after the Exile, Fortress Press, 2004. pp. 435-436 Charlesworth, James H. Jesus and Archaeology, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2006. pp. 323-329The Caiaphas Ossuary Great archaeology, 2010. p. 1 More generally, the contents of the burial cave increase knowledge of ossuary inscriptions and burial customs of the Second Temple period. In June 2011, archaeologists from Bar-Ilan and Tel Aviv Universities announced the recovery of a stolen ossuary, plundered from a tomb in the Valley of Elah. The Israel Antiquities Authority declared it authentic, and expressed regret that it couldn't be studied in situ. It is inscribed with the text: \\"Miriam, daughter of Yeshua, son of Caiaphas, Priest of Ma‚Äôaziah from Beth ‚ÄòImri\\". Based on it, Caiaphas can be assigned to the priestly course of Ma‚Äôaziah, instituted by king David. Authenticity Since the original discovery, the identification with Caiaphas has been challenged by some scholars on various grounds, including the spelling of the inscription, the lack of any mention of Caiaphas's status as High Priest, the plainness of the tomb (although the ossuary itself is as ornate as might be expected from someone of his rank and family), and other reasons.

He was one of the first Italians to take up and develop Mahatma Gandhi's theories of nonviolence and was known as \\"the Italian Gandhi\\".Incontro con il \\"Gandhi\\" italiano, La Stampa, 22 giugno 1968\\"Il Gandhi italiano\\", Panorama No.372, 1973 Life=Early life, 1899‚Äì1920 CapitiniNational Association of Friends Aldo Capitini (1968) was born in Perugia in 1899. His father was a municipal official and his mother a tailor. From an early age Capitini became interested in philosophy and literature. Until the age of 17 years he was interested in the Futurism and nationalists who supported intervention of Italy in World War I. From 1918‚Äì1919 he abandoned modernism and nationalism for humanitarian, pacifist and socialist causes. He was committed to the study of the Latin language and Greek literature. Capitini was physically fragile and fell ill, discovering solidarity with those who suffered \\"the last\\".Capitini 1990: 11 A long illness in his youth led to his religious conversion and the radical change of his political views. Of this period he said, \\"During World War I was a teenager, but I followed the tragedy of humanity. ... Moreover, I suffered a long painful illness and was unable to work. Thus, I understood the limitations of my activist culture in the fibres of my being, which gave paramount value to action, to violence, and to enjoyment, and I felt a deep interest in, and solidarity with, the problems of those who suffer, those who cannot act, and those who are overwhelmed. I would need to envisage a reality where suffering people were perfectly well, and not thrown on the edge of civilization, waiting for death and nothingness. This is how my religious search really started\\". In 1919 he acquired the Technical Institute diploma, then, in 1924, he enrolled into the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, completing his master's degree in Philosophy in 1928. Under Fascism, 1922‚Äì1945 His encounter with Gandhi's nonviolence in the late 1920s defined his style and methods of action. He became a follower of Gandhi's nonviolence and a vegetarian.Capitini 1990: 74 Capitini's religious conversion did not follow the traditional course, which he eventually abandoned when the Catholic Church signed the Lateran Treaty with the Fascist dictatorship in 1929. This made Catholicism the state religion and strengthened the prestige and power of Mussolini, with the Catholic Church becoming an indirect support to his government. As a result, Capitini significantly disassociated with the Catholic Church and became even more committed to his anti-fascist activities.Movimento Nonviolento n.d. From then on, Capitini tried to promote the reform of religion (starting from the Catholic, expanding to other denominations), with the aim of religion focussing on persons and their needs. He proposed that all religions should go beyond their dogmatism and their authoritarian structure to be at the service of marginalized people and those who had no voice in society. In 1930, he began working as a Secretary at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He became close to anti-Fascist students, as a professor being a conscientious objector. In 1933 the director of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, the philosopher and Fascist intellectual Giovanni Gentile, asked Capitini to join the Fascist Party. Capitini refused and was dismissed. He then applied himself to nonviolent non-cooperation. In order to survive, he returned to his family in Perugia, where he undertook private lessons until the end of World War II in 1945. Capitini adopted the propagation of anti-Fascism as an important personal commitment from 1933 to 1943. To achieve this he met with groups of young people, especially in central Italy. This activity was facilitated by the publication of three books on philosophy and religion. The books were able to pass Fascist censorship because of the ambiguity of their titles, which addressed religious themes. Their publication was supported by the liberal philosopher Benedetto Croce, who, even though in disagreement with the Fascist regime, enjoyed a certain degree of freedom because of his international reputation. Capitini was imprisoned twice for five months for his anti-fascist activities from 1942 to 1943. In July 1944, with Emma Thomas (an English Quaker), Capitini founded the Centro di Orientamento Sociale (Centre for Social Orientation). The Centre began its activities in Perugia with free discussions open to all, about local issues problems and national and international political and economic problems. It was successful and spread to other cities, including Ferrara, Florence, Bologna, Lucca, Arezzo, Ancona, Assisi and Naples, but it failed to establish itself permanently because of the indifference of the Left and the hostility of the Christian Democratic Party.Website of Aldo Capitini (Italian) Post-war, 1946‚Äì1968 Capitini, despite his anti-fascist efforts, did not want to be part of the Cold War division of the world, mainly because he did not share many of the aspects of these two world views. He therefore remained isolated and was not able to play an institutional role in the nascent Italian Republic. Nevertheless, from the end of World War II until his death, he was involved in a number of important areas: religious, civil, social and political. Furthermore, he promoted Social Guidance Centres, the Movement of Religion, the Italian Vegetarian Society, and the Association for the Protection and Development of Public Schools. Additionally he became the most important exponent of nonviolence in Italy. In particular, he organized the creation of associations, groups, magazines, national events, public meetings, seminars and conferences. In 1946, he arranged the first meeting on religious problems at that time. Representatives of different currents of religious, political, social, religious scholars, and free researchers were involved. With this conference, he wanted to examine the Italian situation and to find a synthesis between social and religious life. In 1947, he held a second seminar, always with the same issues. In the same year, he also held a third symposium. As a result of these important meetings, the Religious Movement was established. Its aim was the struggle for religious freedom in Italy, the promotion of conferences; an association of ex-priests to assist those in difficulty to the discrimination of the Church; and publishing and distribution of books and pamphlets on religious problems. In 1948, the Religious Movement held the first Italian congress for religious reform in Rome. In 1950, Capitini organized the first Italian conference in Rome on the subject of conscientious objection. Capitini attended the World Congress of Religions for Peace Foundation, held in London in 1950. He proposed the establishment of a Nonviolent Religious International Movement; nevertheless the suggestion was not accepted. He protested against the appeal made by the meeting to religious leaders, saying that leaders are responsible for compromise of states and wars, and that the Congress had to address directly appeal to people individually. Capitini participated in the Congress of Vedanta in London in 1951. The theme was \\"Peace, unity of the world, the spiritual community\\". In January 1952, Capitini promoted an International Conference for Nonviolence in Perugia. At the end of the meeting, he created an International Coordinating Center for Nonviolence. In the same year he held another conference in Perugia to study nonviolence with respect to plant and animal life. The outcome of the conference was the creation of the Italian Vegetarian Society, with Capitini as President and based in Perugia. The vegetarian society became a collective effort after twenty years based on Capitini's personal wishes. However, forty years after his death, the Vegetarian Society continues its activities in the same way, the only difference being its change in name to the Italian Vegetarian Association. In 1953, Capitini also held the first West-East Asia Conference in Perugia. The aim of the meeting was to highlight the similarities between Asia and western countries, especially from nonviolence perspective. Therefore, the effort was to avoid repeating the mistakes of a history of oppression, conquests and wars. In 1954, Capitini held a seminar of lectures and discussions on the methodology of Gandhi in Perugia. The peace flag flown from a balcony in Italy He became a professor of pedagogy at the University of Cagliari in 1956 and in 1965 granted a transfer to the University of Perugia with the same chair. In 1961, with the help of other political forces of the Left, Capitini promoted a 24 km March for Peace and the Brotherhood of Peoples from Perugia to Assisi in 1961, in the context of international tension. Its purpose was to state the wish that 'peace is prepared in time of peace' and to awaken this awareness in public opinion. The event, held in September, was successful and was attended by thousands of people. The success of the March convinced the promoters of the need for continued collaboration in the commitment for peace. The march has been repeated many times since 1961, the most recent in 2011, 50 years after the first one. \\"The Perugia-Assisi Peace March\\", Paolo Andruciolli, rassegna.it, 14 May 2010 (Italian) Out of the 1961 march, a federation of associations and peoples was born, giving life to the Italian Advisory Council for Peace, Capitini was appointed as President. Nonviolent people, who also participated in it, constituted their own independent group: the Nonviolent Movement for Peace, Secretary Capitini. Capitini organized the National Conference on Disarmament Affairs in Florence in 1962, and held a seminar on techniques of nonviolence in Perugia in 1963, with the participation of leaders of the Committee of 100. Inspired by the peace flags used on British peace marches, Capitini got some women of Perugia hurriedly to sew together coloured strips of material for the 1961 peace march. The Story of the Peace Flag (Italian) The use of the flag became widespread with the Pace da tutti i balconi (\\"Peace from every balcony\\") campaign in 2002, a protest against the impending war in Iraq and is now used by peace organizations throughout the world. In 2003, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the opinion of leading advertising executives that it had become more popular than the Italian national flag.\\"Bandiera della pace pi√π popolare del tricolore\\", Corriere della Sera, 20 February 2003 (Italian) The original flag was kept by Capitini's collaborator, Dr. Lanfranco Mencaroni, at Collevalenza, near Todi. In 2011, plans were announced to transfer it to the Palazzo dei Priori in Perugia.Perugia Today (In Italian) At the 12th Congress of War Resisters' International in Rome in 1966, Capitini gave a paper on International nonviolence and permanent revolution. Two meetings in Perugia were the first congresses of the Nonviolent Movement for Peace. Capitini introduced a report, on the attempts of political, and social revolution, favoring the method of violence and thinking to transform society by the simple grabbing of power. He tried to prove that a nonviolent revolution is much more effective and lasting, partly because it avoids the risks and distortions of the authoritarian practices related to violence. Capitini promoted A.D.E.S.S.P.I. (Associazione per la difesa e lo sviluppo della scuola pubblica italiana [Association for the protection and development of the Italian public school]). This association was launched to defend and promote the rights of everyone to an education. In particular, the Association defended the freedom of teaching by attempting to make formal education similar to the confessional. To achieve this, the Association was the guarantor and controller of legislative and administrative power. The Association was a very active and efficient in pursuing its goals and Capitini was very active supporter and promoter of the initiatives. Among those people he engaged were Danilo Dolci (a social activist, sociologist, popular educator and poet, known for his opposition against poverty, social exclusion and the Mafia in Sicily), and Lorenzo Milani (a priest and educator known for his civic education of the poor, and for his fight against injustice and violence). Capitini died on 19 October 1968 following the after-effects of surgery. Ideas Although Capitini remained a religious man his belief were counter-current to the institutional Church who condemned him and his books. The Catholic Church began a complex process of change and openness to the world with the Second Vatican Council (1962 to 1965); however Capitini was not able to see the fruits of this change, dying a few years later. However, in relation to its vision of 'open religion', the most significant and important innovations introduced by the Catholic Church appeared to him to be timid. The philosophical and religious thoughts of his training were based on, the results from the meeting with Claudio Baglietto (philosopher, and conscientious objector who died in exile in Switzerland), and some components that Fortuna2002: 17 defined in his essay to be integral parts of the Kantian criticism (for the primacy of the moral law), idealism (Georg W.F.Hegel, Benedetto Croce, Giovanni Gentile), Marxian analysis and Gandhian spirituality. To these elements, the political scientist and philosopher Norberto Bobbio (1984) added the influence of Giacomo Leopardi (poet and writer) and Giuseppe Mazzini (politician and philosopher). Capitini, as he wrote in his 'Letters of Religion', published posthumously in the book The Power of All,Capitini 1969 to escape the trap of traditional religions and to form his own ideas of religion and inspiration for his deeds, he was forced to go back 'to the teachers of religious life'.Capitini 1969: 326 that he identified with Jesus Christ, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi and Mazzini. For Capitini, it was necessary that the religious dimension of each person was translated into concrete action in public life. His engagement in politics was always astute and constant, while not wishing to have any specific affiliations with political parties. The first example was his rejection of the fascist card and then his fight against Fascism. At the end of the World War II, he wrote the 'Manifesto of the Liberal socialism', together with the philosopher and political scientist Guido Calogero. Their effort was to combine the best ideas of the liberal school with those of socialism. While he did not choose the path of party politics Capitini undertook an intense political life, gaining experience at the Centre for Social Orientation (CSO) and by making decisions in the field of education and pedagogy for a free and non-confessional public school. The author of this essay considered the most original contribution of Capitini to society and to the intellectual world that he attended, was the concept of 'open religion'. It was an idea so cool and innovative to be rejected and regarded with suspicion from the beginning. With the concept of 'open religion' the philosopher of Perugia wanted to introduce radical changes to the dogmas and practices of traditional religions, and wished to build bridges between Western philosophy and Eastern schools of thought (especially Buddhism). Finally, Capitini wanted to transform society by focussing on the spiritual and material needs of persons, also taking into account their libertarian and egalitarian pressures. Nonviolence is the main instrument of change, becoming a lever of social change in the path of improvement that does not exclude anyone. For Capitini, the nonviolence that he put into practice was a product derived from this religious aspiration. Capitini recognized the re- establishment of religion to be an important historical problem, then taking this as a key point of nonviolence. He did not want to empty the religious institutions, but wanted to overcome them instead, re-establishing full consciousness so that politics could be understood as a religious act. His reform of religion was addressed to political action both at a personal and society level. In light of these considerations it is possible to claim that there types of nonviolence exist, 'religious' and 'secular'. Religious nonviolence can be understood as a lifestyle. It is an opening to existence, freedom, development of all people, opposition to oppression and destruction, and as final point it is active resistance. A way of being and living in relationships with others who, before becoming valuable as social action (external to us), must penetrate into our consciousness and be part of us. Meanwhile, secular nonviolence can be understood to be a pragmatic choice to resolve conflicts. Nonviolence becomes an effective method that provides better results, or less damage than, those of violent acts. In this case, the 'minimum' requirement is fulfillment of the two cornerstones of nonviolence: not to use physical violence, nor to offend the dignity of others for the duration of the conflict. In the former, the attitude is related more to the idea of nonviolence expressed by Capitini and Gandhi, in the latter it is possible to identify the contributions of Western scholars, in fact, in the Western academic approach there is the idea of observing the connections between nonviolence and power (the analysis to obtain and maintain power). The Manifesto of Liberal Socialism was outlined by the philosopher Calogero in 1940.Eurostudium 2005 In this manifesto, Calogero collected the ideas of opposition to Fascism by Capitini and other intellectuals. Capitini and Calogero sought to join the best elements of liberalism and socialism. They combined freedom and justice to provide a remarkable insight that could overcome Marxist socialism and reactionary liberalism. The Liberal Socialism movement decided to give him a party ticket, in contrast Capitini decided not to join the party, because he wanted it to perform political lobbying. Capitini's development of nonviolence In the history of nonviolence in Italy, Capitini was the main protagonist, being defined as 'the Italian Gandhi'.Bergagna 1968 Capitini approached nonviolence in the late twenties and in 1931 Gandhi visited Italy for a few days.Pisu 2006 Capitini drew many lessons from Gandhian philosophy; he developed an overarching perspective where nonviolence became the source of inspiration for many of its activities and achievements. His work was also inspired by the concept of persuasion and openness. For Capitini the term persuasion, in the sense of complete conviction, indicated faith, and the deep belief in certain values and commitments. He believed that individual acts, according to the criteria of its profound consciousness, can create value and find something that is worth more than material existence and formal spirituality. Persuasion, a word which Capitini took from the philosopher Carlo Michelstaedter of Gorizia,Capitni 1990: 23‚Äì27 is the ability to pursue one's own ideals with tenacity, and the power of nonviolence, a gentle power, however determined. The opening is the opposite of the conservative and authoritarian vision of Fascism; it is the elevation of the soul toward God. For Capitini, individuals have to open to 'all human beings, to all people, even to things'.Capitini 1990: 13 In some way, he wished that society, the Church and, traditions were opened up to a dimension of freedom and a gift to all. First of all, through the idea of nonviolent non-cooperation he found the strength to refuse the card for entry to the fascist party, losing his job at the University. Initially he developed the concept of omnicracy, the power for all, meaning that each person has the right to participate in government and control of public power through meetings, assemblies, and meetings with politicians and those who held institutional roles. These meetings had to be public, informing people what was happening and what decisions were being taken. In 1948, Pietro PinnaUfficio Nazionale per il Servizio Civile [National Bureau for Civil Service] n.d. listened to Capitini at a conference sponsored by the Movement of Religion in Ferrara. In the aftermath of that occurrence, Pinna matured his choice of conscientious objection. He was the first post-war objector. Pinna underwent a first process and a first conviction in 1949 and served Capitini as testimony in his favor. Capitini mobilized to help young Pinna to his choice of conscientious objection. For this initiative Capitini called on the support of his intellectual friends and Members of the Italian Parliament. The role of religion in Capitini's work His key religious ideas were: *co- presence, *open religion, *you-all people, *'free addition', and *non- mendacity. Capitini identifies the idea of co-presence in the value of all, together. However this does not negate personal individuality, instead to be together embraces each creature and saves them, bringing them towards the full realization of the good. Moreover, in the co-presence next to the dead are the live, engaged in one enterprise to overcome the logic of violence. Capitini wanted that reality to become a space of freedom for everybody. Co-presence needs to be implemented together with all beings, living or not, to create values and freedom from all violence and evil. To do this, all institutions and philosophies must be open. Religion is no exception to this rule, or rather religion, especially the Catholic religion, must be open to people in a free and selfless way, because every being is ‚Äòsacred‚Äô, every being deserves love and absolute respect. The act of faith is therefore a free act, an open giving. Consequently, there is no need for an institution to serve as a means for salvation. Capitini \\"testifies the superficiality of any institution wishing to present itself as a gateway\\".Fortuna 2002: 25 It follows that in an open religion perspective, the distinction between priests and ordinary believers does not make sense, because God will enter the lives of everyone. Capitini‚Äôs prophetic religion radically refutes traditional religion and designates it as a new reality achieved through concrete actions.Vigilante 2000 According to the insights of Capitini, traditional religions need to be rethought and reformed deeply. He identifies four main reasons to understand with a reasonable likelihood because religions have lost their aptitude to be innovative and must radically transform to society and mankind: a) many facts that constituted the historical basis of religion have proved to be incorrect; b) many ideas, deemed to be central and fundamental rules, have not proved to be the most feasible and practicable, c) the essence of religion is no longer considered the adherence to formal rituals and loyalty to the institutions in their crystallized power; d) religions rather than being prophetic and playing a role in social change, have often proved to be a prop of the established power and an element of conservation, both in social and political patterns.National Association of Friends of Aldo Capitini (n.d.) The concept of \\"free addition\\" indicates the difference with traditional religions. Open religion is drawing nearer to people. It is a spontaneous gift, a giving of oneself from within and thus free gift and pure offer. With the concept of \\"free addition\\" Capitini adds value, a positive trend, an improvement to human life from the persons closest to him. The religious life of Capitini is a life open to you-all, where it is possible to meet God through ‚Äòyou‚Äô. God is open to all and creates a relationship. Thus, people and all beings can build a journey of justice and freedom in daily life. In this path, nonviolence and non-lie (no lies about peoples' intentions or actions) are the means to foster this new religiosity effectively. Capitini was one of the first scholars in Italy to understand the significance of relations between East and West. He was probably favoured in this comprehension from having adhered to the idea of nonviolence introduced by Gandhi. In the religious thoughts of Capitini there are many references to Buddhist philosophy. The scholar Vigilante2010 states, in his paper, that there are many similarities between Capitini religiosity, and Buddhism. Capitini lived the experience of suffering as the way to religious conversion. Suffering in Buddhism is a significant feature of the four 'noble truths'. Furthermore, Buddhists view the subject as unthinkable outside of a relational situation with the entire system of living beings. The Buddhist world is interdependent, living beings are interconnected and the salvation of each is possible only with the salvation of others. The respect for life, all life forms, and the desire not to hurt others are also important. Buddhism is aware that the reality is very different from what it ought to be; however mankind has the resources (internal and otherwise) to meet the challenges of reality. Capitini is fully within this vision, it is the vision of nonviolent commitment. Finally, Buddhism has two relevant features for Capitini: a) it teaches universal brotherhood, the attention to the suffering and the equality of all living beings, b) Buddhism is a religion that is not based on authority or on the divinity of its founder, but the effectiveness of its teachings. The latter point ties together theory and practice, thereby Buddhism was a fertile ground for reflection and action of the philosopher from Perugia. Assessments of his life Of Capitini, Fortuna said \\"it is enough to give a rapid glance at the titles of Capitini's books and see how many times the words 'religion', 'religiosity' and 'religious' appear to realize that such an insistence not only cannot be random, but testifies to the fundamental and decisive option.\\"Fortuna 2002: 17 Without religious motivation Capitini would not have been pushed so hard to act in the social and political life. Nonviolence, and non-cooperation are the means he used to achieve his goals of social change and religious innovation. Capitini did not enter into the mechanism of political parties; in a bipolar Italian system (communism vs. capitalism) he did not take sides, defining himself as a 'left-wing independent', actively engaging in politics. It was never an indifference, according to the negative definition given to that term by Antonio Gramsci.Gramsci n.d. He was opposed and condemned by the traditional Catholic Church, and was regarded as a utopian dreamer for his idea of nonviolence and for his insight to tackle conflicts through nonviolence. Of him Bobbio said, '\\"that was a Gandhian in the land of Machiavelli, a religious heretic in the land of the Counter Reformation (and the associated indifference), a pacifist, religious, and moreover, in a country where a tradition of thought and action pacifist has never existed, \\"even to the point that the \\" great slaughter \\"of the first Italy in World War II caused \\"feelings of nonviolent tremors' comparable to occurring in the European context'.Bobbio 1969 cited in Mercurelli 2008‚Äì2009: 52 There is a great consistency of thought with the personal life of Capitini. Moreover, within Capitini exists a vaster intuition and a greater and more perfect vision of the needs of mankind. The discovery of nonviolence makes this an unbeatable view of finding the means for its realization. These instruments are perfectly in line with his philosophy and his way of seeing things. From this was born a fruitful 'marriage' of dozens of initiatives, publications, and writings. His commitment involved many people, associations, and groups. On his ability to act, he generated new patterns of comparison, analysis and action. The most striking demonstration of the validity of his significant commitment is demonstrated by the legacy he left. Forty-three years after his death, the Italian Nonviolent Movement is still in existence, the Nonviolent Action magazine and his meaningful insights are still valid today, being able to draw the attention of scholars and intellectuals who have the expertise to fully assess Capitini's legacy. In addition, there has been a wide spread of nonviolence and its methods, and in Italy the first degree-oriented peace research, was established by the University of Pisa and Florence in the academic year 2001‚Äì2002. On the other hand, it must be said that civil Italian society still has to acknowledge the idea of nonviolence as an operational tool for conflict transformation, in order to become an overwhelming majority, and the route of religious change remains very long and difficult. On the whole Capitini has made a significant and real contribution to the development of nonviolence, starting from its condition of 'free religious' and this commitment has not disappeared. The socialist politician Pietro Nenni said a short sentence, it summarizes in a clear, effective and illuminating manner the uniqueness, diversity and commitment of Capitini. On the death of Capitini he wrote: '‚Ä¶ Aldo Capitini was counter-current during the time of Fascism and then again in the post-Fascism era. Maybe it is too much for one human life, however beautiful it is‚Äô.Nenni 1983: 228 Writings *1937 Elementi di un'esperienza religiosa, (Elements of a Religious Experience, Outlined his religious philosophy and presented the theoretical foundations of the principles of nonviolence.), Laterza, Bari. *1942 Vita religiosa, Cappelli, Bologna. *1943 Atti della presenza aperta, Sansoni, Firenze. *1947 Saggio sul soggetto della storia, La Nuova Italia, Firenze. *1948 Esistenza e presenza del soggetto in Atti del Congresso internazionale di Filosofia (II Vol.), Castellani, Milano. *1948 La realt√† di tutti, Arti Grafiche Tornar, Pisa. *1948 Religious Problems Today *1949 Italia nonviolenta, (Nonviolent Italy), Libreria Internazionale di Avanguardia, Bologna. *1950 Nuova socialit√† e riforma religiosa, (New Social Relations and Religious Reform), Einaudi, Torino. *1951 L'atto di educare, La Nuova Italia, Firenze. *1955 Religione aperta, (Open Religion), Guanda, Modena. *1956 Colloquio corale, Pacini Mariotti, Pisa. *1956 Open Revolution *1957 I Argue the Religion of Pius XXII *1958 Aggiunta religiosa all'opposizione, Parenti, Firenze. *1958 Danilo Dolci on nonviolence *1958 The experience of Danilo Dolci *1959 Conscientious Objection in Italy *1961 Battezzati non credenti, (Non-Believing Baptized), Parenti, Firenze. *1962 On the Road to Peace *1962 Nonviolence Today *1964 Founded the magazine Nonviolent Action, which became the official organ of the Nonviolent Movement. *1964 Civic Education in School and Social Life *1965 Religious Life *1967 Le tecniche della nonviolenza, (The Techniques of Nonviolence), Feltrinelli, Milano (rist.

Traditionally, they are considered a pariah group by the Arabs and their name has been used as a catch-all term covering other pariah groups as well, such as the  øAwƒÅzim of eastern Arabia and the JibƒÅliyya of the Sinai. Many groups labelled Hutaym call themselves RashƒÅyida .William C. Young (1997), \\"From Many, One: The Social Construction of the RashƒÅyida Tribe in Eastern Sudan\\", Northeast African Studies, New Series 4(1): 71‚Äì108. Hutaym (plural HitmƒÅn) is sometimes incorrectly spelled ·∏§utaym or al-Hutaym. The standard pronunciation in Peninsular Arabic is ihtƒìm. It comes from the adjective ahtam and means \\"a man whose two front teeth are broken off at the root\\", that is, one who cannot trace his ancestry. A member of the tribe is called a Hutaymƒ´. The main sections of the tribe are ƒÄl BarrƒÅk, ƒÄl QalƒÅdƒÅn, ƒÄl ShumaylƒÅn, Ma·∫ìƒÅbira, NawƒÅmisa and FuhayqƒÅt. The head of ƒÄl BarrƒÅk is traditionally chief of the whole tribe.H. R. P. Dickson (1967 [1949]). The Arab of the Desert: A Glimpse into Badawin Life in Kuwait and Sau ædi Arabia. London: George Allen and Unwin. App. XVII, p. 606, lists 22 different sections and their sheikhs as of 1941. There is little reliable information on the origins of the Hutaym, which is consistent with the name's being a derogatory term applied by outsiders to socially low-ranking groups. The Arab tribes regard them as neither Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅnite nor  øAdnƒÅnite and thus not true Arabs by descent, and refuse to intermarry with them. One story, however, attributes their pariah status to an act of incest by the eponymous ancestor Hutaym, who was presumably an Arab. Another account makes them descendants of the Ban≈´ HilƒÅl. James Raymond Wellsted, who visited them in the early 1830s, speculated that they were the Ichthyophagi mentioned by classical authors.Richard F. Burton (1882), \\"The Ethnology of Modern Midian\\", Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature of the United Kingdom 12: 249‚Äì330. The Hutaym regard themselves as kin of another pariah group, the SharƒÅrƒÅt. Both groups breed dromedaries and are thus more respected than the ·π¢ulayb, a pariah group that breeds donkeys. They are regarded as superior hunters to the Bedouins (noble Arab nomads), but inferior to the ·π¢ulayb. They also raise sheep and goats. The Hutaym of the coast are fishers. The Hutaym live mainly around Khaybar and the ·∏§arrat Khaybar lava field has also been called the ·∏§arrat Hutaym. They also live in the Naf≈´d and the oasis al-Mustajidda and have migrated into the TihƒÅma to the south. Groups labelled Hutaymƒ´ are also found in Egypt, Sudan and the islands of the Red Sea, although it is not clear whether these groups are actually related to peninsular Hutaym. The Hutaymƒ´ camel traders of Kassala have intermarried with the Beja. The term Hutaym first appears in Arabic literature around 1200, then again in Ottoman tax records of the early 16th century. They were one of the five tribes of the sanjak of Gaza who paid tribute to the sultan. A record of 1553 states they habitually raided the sanjak of Ajlun and had to be put down. By the 19th century, as recorded by several European travellers, the term being used to describe a low caste and not a specific tribe. The English poet Charles Montagu Doughty travelled through Hutaymƒ´ territory in 1877‚Äì1878 and wrote about his experience in Travels in Arabia Deserta. He considered them more robust than the Bedouins but less dignified. The British Admiralty's Handbook of Arabia, written for the Arab Revolt during World War I in 1916, denigrated them as soldiers but admitted that they openly resisted the Rashƒ´dƒ´ Emirate (Britain's adversary) and even raided the outskirts of the Rashƒ´dƒ´ capital, ·∏§ƒÅ æil.

Biography Born in Zagreb on 9 February 1926, Vrhovec first became politically engaged during World War II, during which he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Partisans (1941‚Äì1945). After the war, Vrhovec enrolled at the University of Zagreb and graduated from the Faculty of Economics. Upon graduation, Vrhovec started working at the Zagreb-based daily Vjesnik, where he soon became editor of the newspaper's Wednesday edition (), which was at the time the company's most popular edition (he had two stints in the position, 1956‚Äì1957 and 1959‚Äì1963). He also spent several years working as Vjesnik's correspondent from the United Kingdom (1957‚Äì1959) and the United States (1963‚Äì1967). Upon returning to Zagreb in 1968 he was appointed chief editor at Vjesnik, position he held until 1970 when he was replaced by Milovan Baletiƒá. In the late 1960s Vrhovec became more seriously involved in politics and quickly rose to high- ranking positions in the Party following the downfall of the Croatian Spring movement in the early 1970s, as a prot√©g√© of Vladimir Bakariƒá's faction within the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH). Between 1972 and 1974 he was a member of the SKH Central Committee and from 1974 to 1978 served as member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). As a member of the Central Committee he submitted a proposal to Milka Planinc to arrest and charge members of the Croatian Spring, including Franjo Tuƒëman, Marko Veselica, Dra≈æen Budi≈°a, ≈†ime ƒêodan, Vlado Gotovac, and Hrvoje ≈†o≈°iƒá. His next office was the highest point of his political career as he served as Yugoslav Minister of Foreign Affairs from May 1978 to May 1982 under Prime Minister Veselin ƒêuranoviƒá and during the last two years of Josip Broz Tito's reign before his death in 1980. As minister of foreign affairs, Vrhovec spent the first two years of his term accompanying Tito during his travels abroad. Following Tito's death Vrhovec was in charge of shaping Yugoslavia's foreign policy, in which he promoted the idea of improving relations with the West and opening up the country to foreign investments. He reportedly talked with Ronald Reagan several times in the early 1980s about the possibility of introducing multi-party democracy and market economy reforms in Yugoslavia. Despite this, the economic reform commission chaired by Vrhovec from 1985 to 1986 made little mention of democratization. After serving a full four-year term, Vrhovec was appointed to the post of chairman of the League of Communists of Croatia, and from May 1984 to May 1989 he represented SR Croatia in the 9-member Presidency of Yugoslavia, a collective body functioning as head of state. In the latter half of the 1980s Vrhovec was one of the first Yugoslav politicians who were openly opposed to Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's nationalist policies, at the time when Milo≈°eviƒá's rise to power began. He was also one of the key people involved in the organisation of the 1987 Summer Universiade, the biggest sporting event hosted by Zagreb. After his term ended, Vrhovec effectively retired from politics. Vrhovec died at the Sisters of Charity Hospital in Zagreb on 15 February 2006 and was buried at Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb on 21 February 2006.

It is the fourth book in the pentalogy \\"The Secret Series\\", and is the sequel to This Book Is Not Good for You, If You're Reading This, It's Too Late, and The Name of this Book is Secret. The book is based on the sense of sight as the other books are based on scent, sound, and taste. It acts as the continued part of This Book Is Not Good For You, starting just after Cass eats the magic \\"Time-Travel\\" chocolate and falls into a coma, searching for her ancestor, the Jester, to find out what the Secret of immortality is, as she recently became the new Secret-Keeper of the Terces Society. Meanwhile, Max- Ernest tries to save Cass with a special monocle, as the book centers around the sense of sight. One of the most major secrets revealed in the story is that Pseudonymous Bosch may possibly be Max-Ernest, as the later described in the story that he saw his future self writing about him and Cass. As it is unlikely Bosch actually went on the adventures Max-Ernest went on with Cass, it is possible he simply based Max-Ernest on himself as a child. He also tells the story of when he nearly drowned in a jar of mayonnaise, describing how when he was a baby an old pea had gotten stuck in the folds of his thigh, causing him to scream and cry all the time. One day, however, at a restaurant, a waitress takes him to quiet him, discovers the pea, and washes him out in a very large jar of mayonnaise to get it out. However, he sinks to the bottom, and she is unable to get him out. However, the head chef rescues him, and squeezed the pea out of his thigh. Ever since then, Pseudonymous Bosch has had a morbid fear of mayonnaise, and a warm affinity for sous chefs.  Plot  The story starts off with Cass awakening somewhere unknown to her, in an unknown time (she later finds she is in fact 500 years in the past), not knowing who she is, where she came from, or what she is doing. She sees a young boy stuck in a tree, and tries to rescue him, only to hear him repeatedly shouting the word \\"Goat!\\", evidently frightened. He runs down the road to his father, but neither of them even look at the girl. Confused, the girl walks up to a puddle, only to see that she has no reflection, realizing that she must be invisible, and that the boy was shouting \\"Ghost,\\" not \\"Goat.\\" Meanwhile, Max-Ernest visits Cass in the PICU section of the hospital, where Cass lies in bed comatose. Max-Ernest, though evidently depressed over his friend comatose, (and the fact that the Tuning Fork won't help him create the antidote for Cass) with his only other friend Yo-Yoji away in Japan has overcome his \\"fear/allergy\\" of chocolate and eats several bars in a matter of seconds. Back to Cass, she realizes she has somehow traveled in time and arrived in the Renaissance/Middle Ages. She also realizes she's invisible, not dead. At the streets, she meets a Seer, who can see her because she has something called the \\"Second Sight\\", obtained by an object called the Double Monocle (as this book centers around the sense of sight). She also does some fortune telling with a deck of tarot cards with Cass, showing her that the Ace of Wands card is upside down, meaning that an old wrong must be righted. The Seer gives a suggestion that maybe something has been stolen or she has stolen something. She then shows Cass the Fool card, with a picture of a fool, coincidentally the one that she saw while in the streets. When the Seer introduce her name as Clara or Cassandra, Cass' memories came back, making her remember about the Magician, the Jester, the Secret etc. She realizes she's on a mission to find the Secret, since she is the new Terces Society Secret Keeper. The Seer disappears but leaves Cass the Double Monocle. Meanwhile, Max-Ernest goes to visit Pietro, who is playing Tarocchino with the circus crew. Pietro introduces the idea of tarot cards that has involvement in Cass' coma, which confuses Max-Ernest. Pietro explains that the Ace of Wands card is upside down, which refers to the fact that the Tuning Fork should be returned to their principal, Mrs. Johnson. He explains the Fork wants to be returned to its owner, so that is why it won't work. Lastly, Pietro tells Max-Ernest that he \\"must bring her home from her head\\" with mind reading. Back to Cass, she experiments with the Double Monocle, which she finds out that she could see through walls. When a parade comes to the streets announcing that the Duke is to give gifts of riches to the King, Cass, taking advantage of her invisibility climbs onto the parade, believing that it'll lead her to the palace, where she could find the Jester. The parade is raided by Anastasia and her bandits, who returns the jewels and riches to the poor. She also discovers a lodestone that attracts a lot of metal which she keeps. Back at school, when Max-Ernest is about to return the Tuning Fork to Mrs. Johnson, he meets the new secretary Opal, who pranks him into not knocking on Mrs. Johnson's door, resulting in her scolding him. The principal is dressed like a queen, because of the upcoming Ren-Faire, a Renaissance themed fair. Max-Ernest sees that Mrs. Johnson is wearing the lodestone as a necklace, who she explains that her great great aunt Clara was wearing it. At the palace, Cass sees a man telling a creature to sleep in the dog kennels. The creature is Mr. Cabbage Face. When she calls out his name, the homunculus looks at her, meaning that he could see Cass. Cass realizes if Mr. Cabbage Face is here, then Lord Pharaoh, the founder of the Midnight Sun (evil alchemists who go murderous lengths to seek immortality) is too. Cass also realizes that in the Tale of Mr. Cabbage Face, the author got the place where the homunculus stayed in the palace wrong. It wasn't a pigsty, but a dog kennel. Meanwhile, Benjamin Blake arrives from his old school, the New Promethean, completely changed. He is now wearing a tuxedo and owns the Double Monocle. He eats lunch with Max-Ernest, Daniel-not- Danielle and Glob in the Nuts Table. Benjamin reveals a note stuck on Max- Ernest's back, saying a strange message. At the kennels, Cass talks with the homunculus after giving him some leftover chicken as he was starving. When Cass gets the homunculus to speak a bit, the Jester arrives and carries own the conversation as notated in The Tale of Cabbage Face: A Gothic Tale. The Jester frees the homunculus before he is caught and sent to the dungeon, which is the place where the chamber pots are emptied. At Max-Ernest's house, Max- Ernest's parents announce that they are expecting a baby boy, overwhelming Max-Ernest. At the dungeon, Lord Pharaoh suddenly arrives and bumps into an invisible Cass, causing the Double Monocle to fall off. Lord Pharaoh uses it and realizes the presence of Cass. Lord Pharaoh confiscates all of Cass' belongings (just a triangle of Senor Hugo's chocolate which he took to investigate) and throws Cass into a cell with the Jester. Cass reveals to the Jester that she is invisible and is his great great.........granddaughter. He first disregards it as madness but slowly believes her. At school, Max-Ernest decodes the message and reveals a troubling \\"LORD PHARAOH LIVES\\" (probably because Lord Pharaoh ate Cass' chocolate). At school, Amber invited Max-Ernest for a fortune telling session and when telling him that he is in love with Cass, Benjamin reads her mind and reveals to everyone that she lied, breaking her reputation. Benjamin reveals to Max-Ernest that he can mind read and agrees to read Cass' mind, like Pietro said. Max-Ernest would have to act an injury while Benjamin sneaks in. Meanwhile, Anastasia frees everyone in the dungeon and flees to her campsite. At the hospital, the janitor notices Cass whispering \\"The Secret....what is the Secret...\\" but decides not to report it immediately. Then, Max-Ernest charges into the Emergency Room screaming because he has an \\"epileptic fit with the combined result of his allergy to vinyl and a cardiac arrest with the effects of white coat syndrome\\". But Max- Ernest's cover is blown, resulting in him to go back to Cass' room, just as Benjamin was about to see something. At home, Max-Ernest receives an Email from Yo-Yoji telling him that the school Benjamin went to is run by the Midnight Sun, Dr. L being principal. Max-Ernest sees why Benjamin was so eager to find out what was in Cass' mind. At the campsite, the bandits are ambushed by the soldiers. At school, Max-Ernest eavesdrop Benjamin and Amber talking. Amber was begging Benjamin to let her try the monocle. Eventually she lunges and grabs Benjamin's monocle, and sees through walls and almost catches Max- Ernest. Max-Ernest discovers that Benjamin has no mind reading powers, it's just his monocle. Benjamin tries to get the monocle back but Max-Ernest runs with it. He trips and Opal catches the monocle and reports Benjamin and Amber to the principal and sends Max-Ernest to the nurse's office. Opal leaves her purse there, giving Max-Ernest the chance to get the monocle. At the campsite, the other soldiers and their dogs search for Cass. The homunculus saves her by letting the dogs chase him. He also leaves Cass the treasure chest. In the treasure chest, Cass finds the lodestone and the Jester and Cass save them by throwing the a sword onto the lodestone the Jester uses it to play a trick where Cass throws a sword, instantly attracted to the magnet and making the soldiers beg for forgiveness, as they thought something supernatural had occurred. At the hospital, Max-Ernest could not find Cass as she has left the hospital because there is nothing the doctors could do. Max-Ernest uses the monocle to see himself in the mirror, revealing his future self eating massive amounts of chocolate and writing a book. It seems as if Pseudonymous Bosch is Max-Ernest because of his love of chocolate and being a writer. At the campsite, Anastasia discovers the truth - that the Jester has befriended an invisible girl. Cass draws herself on a scroll with some clay. Anastasia leaves and the Jester promises Cass that he will find the Secret from Lord Pharaoh and make clues for her to find. At Cass' house, everything is mess and disorganized as Melanie is depressed. Melanie, Larry and Wayne go out, leaving Max-Ernest to look over Cass, still comatose. Max-Ernest makes a very very long talk to Cass, and plays Yo-Yoji's guitar tunes from his pc. But it turns out Yo-Yoji was actually in Cass' bedroom and was playing the chords live. Suddenly, the power goes out, revealing to be Benjamin who cut the power lines. Benjamin breaks into Cass' house and demands the monocle. Just as a fight was about to start, someone throws Yo-Yoji's guitar on Benjamin, knocking him out. It is revealed to be Cass who threw the guitar. Cass had awoken because of Max-Ernest's speech, Yo-Yoji's heavy metal and the sudden jolt of electric when Benjamin cut the power. Max-Ernest ties him up just in time when Melanie, Larry and Wayne return. Meanwhile, Max-Ernest's brother is born, and is named Paul-Clay. At the Ren-Faire, Glob live-blogs his famous food blog, typing down all kinds of events. But at 11:35 AM, Glob writes in his blog that when he went down to the river bank where there is smoke because he thought there was a barbecue there, he witnesses the Midnight Sun chanting the word \\"SECRET\\" over and over again near a fire with a very bright ball. He then sees Ms. Mauvais drink from a goblet and giving it to an invisible Lord Pharaoh to drink. The Midnight Sun catches Glob spying and he flees, before hiding in a cave under a hamburger-shaped rock. Back in the fair, the trio and a cured and normal dull Benjamin are at a camera obscura, viewing the fair. When they leave, Cass goes into a tent and the Seer has a conversation with her. When she comes out and goes back in again, there is no Seer inside, but a robot who tells fortunes. The robot gives her cards with things that the Seer said, but the words turn into normal things after Cass reads it. At the joust, an armored man called Sir Unknown (Lord Pharaoh) battles Yo-Yoji. the armored man tells the Master of Arms that he represents Mary Queen of Scots (Ms. Mauvais). Just then, Opal tells everyone the joust will stop because a student had participated in the joust and Yo-Yoji had to leave. As Mrs. Johnson bestows Unknown as winner, he snatches the lodestone from her neck, since he knows the Secret is on it. The rest of the Midnight Sun (disguised as guards) flee as Mrs. Johnson demands that the lodestone is returned to her or else the trio will be expelled. At the camera obscure, Opal reveals himself to be Owen, the accent changing spy of the Terces Society which explains why he told off Amber and Benjamin, not Max-Ernest and why he left the purse for Max-Ernest to rummage into. Then, at the Camera Obscura, Cass uses the monocle and sees that the Jester is there, since if she doesn't wear the monocle she couldn't see him. Suddenly, Daniel-not-Danielle calls Max-Ernest and tells him about Glob's emergency blog post. The trio rush to the riverbank mentioned in the blog post and while Max-Ernest and Yo-Yoji rescue Glob, whom eats a lot of Cass' special trail mix, Cass rushes to the mentioned fireplace, where she meets Sir Unknown, whom reveals himself to be Lord Pharaoh, invisible. Lord Pharaoh demands Cass to tell him how the lodestone works, but Cass distracts him by throwing the monocle and running away with the lodestone. Max-Ernest then hears Cass' calls of help and Yo-Yoji comes out, uses a branch from a tree to trip Lord Pharaoh over and hang him upside down. At Medieval Days Restaurant that night, Cass, Max-Ernest, Yo-Yoji, Paul-Clay and Benjamin have dinner. The trio try to solve the message said to be written on it by the Jester but fails. Later, at the fire station, Max-Ernest comes with Paul-Clay's toy which has magnetic powder on it. The lodestone attracts all of the powder and is covered by powder except a lining of silver that spells \\"AS ABOVE SO BELOW\\". Cass is disappointed with the result until the postman comes and gives a trunk to Cass. He explains that the trunk has been to all 7 continents in the world and the recipient is her. When the postman leaves, Cass finds out that the password combination to unlock the trunk is \\"AS SO\\" and unlocks it, revealing treasure from the chest Anastasia stole earlier. When she goes home, Melanie finds a scroll with a drawing of Cass on it, which was the one she drew 500 years ago, and she tells her there is a scrap of papyrus stuck on it. Cass snatches the papyrus, knowing the Secret is on it an rushes into her room to read it, but the papyrus is rapidly turning into dust. The story ends here to be continued in the next book.

History It was designed in 1907 by Wac≈Çaw Szymanowski for its planned erection on the centenary of Chopin's birth in 1810 but its execution was delayed by controversy about the design, then by the outbreak of World War I. The statue was finally cast and erected in 1926. Encyklopedia powszechna PWN (1976), vol. 4, p. 372. The members of the jury who selected the winning project included such figures as Antoine Bourdelle, J√≥zef Pius Dzieko≈Ñski and Leopold M√©yet.

According to local legend, the next day a handwritten sign was found at the site which read: \\"I don‚Äôt know who destroyed me, but I know why: so that I won‚Äôt play the funeral march for your leader.\\" After the end of the war, the monument was rebuilt. Architect Oskar Sosnowski designed the pedestal and basin, which are made of red WƒÖchock sandstone. The inscription on the pedestal reads: The Statue of Fryderyk Chopin, destroyed and plundered by the Germans on 31 May 1940, rebuilt by the Nation. 17 October 1946. Another inscription engraved on the monument is a quote from Adam Mickiewicz's narrative poem Konrad Wallenrod: Flames will consume our painted history, sword-wielding thieves will plunder our treasures, the song will be saved... The original mould for the statue, which had survived the war, made it possible to cast a replica, which was placed at the original site in 1958. Since 1959, free piano recitals of Chopin's compositions have been performed at the statue's base on summer Sunday afternoons. The stylized willow over Chopin's seated figure echoes a pianist's hand and fingers, and the Polish eagle's head on the right end. A 1:1-scale replica of Szymanowski's statue stands in Hamamatsu, Japan. There are also preliminary plans to erect another replica along Chicago's lakefront, in addition to a different sculpture commemorating the artist in Chopin Park.Chopin Monument in Chicago Szymanowski's statue was the world's tallest Chopin monument until the unveiling, on March 3, 2007, of a slightly taller, modernistic bronze in Shanghai, China.

Liu, who was backed by former Czech president V√°clav Havel and anti-apartheid activist and cleric Desmond Tutu, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, received the award among a record field of more than 200 nominees. The decision, while widely praised by foreign intellectuals and politicians, was quickly condemned by the Chinese government and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also denounced the award and what they regarded as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China‚Äîon the Internet, television and in print media. The government strongly denounced the award and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest. The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate. Liu's wife was put under house arrest before the decision of the Nobel Committee was announced. Chinese diplomats moved to pressure other countries not to attend the award ceremony, which was scheduled for 10 December. The diplomatic missions of democratic countries in Oslo received warning letters from their Chinese counterparts; the deputy foreign minister also warned countries of \\"the consequences\\". In December, the Chinese Foreign Ministry continued the rhetorical assault, stating \\"more than 100 countries and international organisations [had] expressed explicit support of China's position\\". In the end, 46 countries attended of the 65 invited (the People's Republic of China and 19 other nations declined invitations). China's official news agency, Xinhua, attacked the West for its \\"Cold-War or even colonial mentality\\" and for daring to \\"regard themselves as the judge, the teacher [who] assume that they can forever distort the fact and block the truth by using political maneuvers.\\" Strong rhetoric and denunciations of the West continued from official sources until after the ceremony. Liu was the first person of Chinese nationality to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the first to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.
