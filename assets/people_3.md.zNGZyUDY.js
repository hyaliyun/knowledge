It the site of Basel Minster, in the Swiss city of Basel. The fort was abandoned or destroyed shortly after its construction, before the end of the 1st century BC, with the Roman conquest of the Alps and the establishment of the province of Gallia Belgica. By the early 1st century AD, there was a small vicus on the hill built on top of the ruins of the oppidum, possibly the origin of the name Basilia, from a toponym villa Basilia \\"estate of Basilius\\". In the mid-3rd century, the ruined oppidum was rebuilt as a Roman castrum, fortified with an encircling wall in c. 270. The vicus was abandoned, and the hill served as part of the Roman fortifications of the Rhine against the advancing Alamanni throughout the 4th century. The name Basilia for the Roman fortification is first mentioned in 237/8, and is named by Ammianus Marcellinus as a base used by Valentinian I in his campaign in Gaul in the 360s. The castle was abandoned after the death of Flavius Aetius in 454 and was probably once again in ruins by the 6th century, when the Alamannic settlement was established that would grow into the medieval city of Basel. The first Basel cathedral was built on the site in the early 9th century (replaced by an early Romanesque structure in c. 999-1025, and by the current late Romanesque church in the 12th century). The site was excavated by Furger-Gunti in the 1970s. There is an older undefended La T√®ne site at Basel Gasfabrik, not far from the oppidum, which was abandoned after the fort was completed.

It was written by Ewa Cichon and produced by Ewa Cichon and Kay Headley who also plays the role of the father-Cassius Paterson, who is the main character in the film. Light Decision was presented at the Cannes Film Festival 2010 Short Film Corner. Background Writer and Producer Ewa Cichon first came up with the idea for the film in 2008, when knife crime in London was on the rise. With each press report of another murder, there always seemed to have been someone stating that \\"lessons must be learnt...\\", which eventually became the theme of the film Light Decision ‚Äî How many \\"lessons\\" do we have to learn before we finally decide to do something? Production In April 2009, Juriaan Booij, an RCA graduate and a filmmaker best known for his documentary about a sinking nation of Tuvalu \\"King Tide\\", was filming his graduation short film \\"Conformists\\". Juriaan cast Kay Headley and Tom Bonington, both actors who went on to star in 'Light Decision'. Ewa Cichon had been asked to take stills from the set and that's how Ewa and Juriaan met. Having been very impressed with Juriaan's style as a director, Ewa and Kay set up a meeting with him and \\"Conformists\\" Director of Photography Justin Brown for August 2009 to discuss the script for \\"Light Decision\\". Principal photography commenced on 6 October 2009, when the beginning of the film had been shot. After finding a new DOP (Tom Turley), the filming continued in November 2009. By the end of January 2010 the film had been edited by Kay Headley and Ewa Cichon with input from the director. Kay Headley composed the music for the film and designed the sound. In March 2010, the film had been entered to Cannes Film Festival Short Film Corner and the London Film Festival.

The imago is active by day and rests on its forelegs and mid-legs only, with the hindlegs raised over the abdomen. It is occasionally attracted to light. Eggs are laid singly on either side of a leaf, near the margin, or on a petiole of bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus). When hatching the larva are colourless and chew through the top of the egg, leaving the rest uneaten. They soon become green matching the colour of their foodplant and live on the upper side of a leaf under a slight web, occasionally moving to a fresh leaf. The pupa ia initially green and darkens with successive colour changes before becoming iridescent. It is in an open network cocoon which is attached to a stem; often low down.

History  The line was built by the Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig Railway Company (German: Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipziger Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), with construction starting on 24 January 1838. It was the first German railway that passed through several countries, in addition to the kingdoms of Prussia (Magdeburg, Halle) and Saxony (Leipzig), it also crossed the Duchy of Anhalt-K√∂then. Opening dates: *29 June 1839: Magdeburg‚ÄìSch√∂nebeck (14.9 km) *9 September 1839: Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìSaale bridge near Calbe (12.4 km) *19 June 1840: Saale bridge‚ÄìK√∂then (22.6 km) *22 July 1840: Halle‚ÄìK√∂then (35.7 km) *18 August 1840: Halle‚ÄìLeipzig (33.2 km) Finally on 18 August 1840 the whole line from Magdeburg to Leipzig was opened. As the Magdeburg station in Leipzig was adjacent to the Dresden station, passengers between Magdeburg and Dresden (the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway opened in 1837) changed trains here. Later a short connecting line was built for the transfer of coaches. Between Halle and Leipzig the line passed from Prussia to Saxony. The section of the line in Saxony was operated under contract by the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company. On 29 April 1874, the Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig Railway Company purchased the Saxon section of the line with effect from 1 January 1875. Duplication of the line from Magdeburg Leipzig, which had started in 1842, was completed on 15 January 1843. On 1 November 1843 regular freight services commenced. In 1873 a line opened to connect Magdeburg‚Äôs two stations. Magdeburg‚Äôs walls prevented a joint station being built. There was a station for trains to Wittenberge and Hamburg with the Leipziger station serving trains on the Magdeburg-Leipzig line and trains to Berlin, Braunschweig and Halberstadt. On 1 June 1876 the Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig Railway Company was taken over by the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company, which was nationalized by Prussia under an act of 20 December 1879. The Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig line came under the management of the K√∂nigliche preu√üischen Eisenbahndirektion Magdeburg (Royal Prussian railway directorate of Magdeburg). From 1 April 1895 it came under the management of the new railway directorate of Halle-Leipzig. On 1 May 1912 the Prussian part of the Leipzig Hauptbahnhof was opened, leading to the closure of the Magdeburger station. On 1 April 1920, the Magdeburg-Leipzig line went along with the other German state railways was merged into Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen (German Railways), which on 30 August 1924 became Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (German Railway Company). E 44 046 at Leipzig Hbf, one of the electric locomotives introduced in the 1950s In 1920 electrification of the section between Halle and Leipzig began, with the first electric locomotive operating on it on 19 December 1922. Electrification from Magdeburg to Leipzig was completed on 7 October 1934. In 1946, the electrical installations were dismantled as reparations. On 1 September 1955, electric trains started running again between Halle and K√∂then, after the Soviet Union returned some electric locomotives. Electrification was restored between K√∂then and Sch√∂nebeck on 29 December 1955, between Sch√∂nebeck and Magdeburg on 12 January 1957, and the final section between Leipzig and Halle on 20 December 1958. Operations  Currently, the section between Magdeburg and Halle is served by Regionalbahn trains that run hourly and are made up of three double-deck carriages with control cars and propelled by class 143 electric locomotives. Trains on line S1 of the Mittelelbe S-Bahn between Magdeburg and Sch√∂nebeck, run between Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof and Magdeburg-Buckau on separate tracks. This service is operated with class 425 EMUs, which were modernised in 2015. Furthermore, the line is used Regional-Express services every two hours to Erfurt and every two hours between Magdeburg and Sch√∂nebeck by Regional- Express services to Aschersleben. Lines S3 and S5X of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland run between Halle and Gr√∂bers or Wahren with Bombardier Talent 2 multiple units. The S5X service to Gr√∂bers runs on the mainline tracks and then uses the Erfurt‚ÄìLeipzig/Halle high-speed railway towards Leipzig/Halle Airport. In addition InterCity trains on IC lines 56 and 55 operate together providing an hourly service, stopping only in Magdeburg Hbf, K√∂then, Halle Hbf, Leipzig/Halle Airport and Leipzig Hbf.

The story was first published in Focus Philippines in 1984 and is part of the author's first short story collection, Woman With Horns and Other Stories (New Day Publishers, 1987). The US edition of Woman With Horns and Other Stories was published in 2020 by PALH/Philippine American Literary House. The title refers to a fictional character named Agustina Macaraig, an Ubecan widow, rumored to have horns. Brainard's character was inspired by fanciful folklore from Cebu, Philippines,where she grew up in and which inspired her to create the setting of many of her stories - Ubec, which is Cebu backwards. Summary The story is set in 1903 a year after the tumultuous Philippine-American War. America was busy sending American administrators to their newly acquired colony in the Pacific. One of those who went to the \\"Islands\\" and who ended up in Ubec was a New York City doctor and widower, Gerald McAllister. As the Public Health Director of Ubec, he carries on with his duties of establishing a vaccination program to stop a cholera epidemic. His initial meeting of the beautiful and sensual widow, Agustina Macaraig, disturbs and irritates the doctor. It is his assistant, Dr. Jaime Laurel, who reminds him that life is more than work: \\"Friend, you don't know how to enjoy life. Look at the sun turning red, getting ready to set spectacularly. It is a wonderful afternoon, you walk with a friend, you talk about beautiful women, about life...\\" It is Agustina Macaraig who eventually teaches Gerald McAllister to love and live once more.

He was one of Nigeria's most famous public servants as a result of the \\"Udoji Award\\" and his various roles in the government and private sector. Udoji commanded respect both nationally and internationally as an honest, disciplined and intellectually alert public administrator and private sector operator. He received his education at the University of Cambridge in England and later the Economic Institute of the World Bank in Washington. He held the traditional title of Igwe, was a recipient of the Commander of the most distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George by the British Crown in 1959, Commander of Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFR) in 1963, and became a Papal knight of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great in 1975. Udoji was one of Africa's most distinguished administrators who had the rare and remarkable opportunity to serve in not only the colonial, military and civilian governments in Nigeria but also in the country's expanding private sector. He was the first African administrative officer to serve in the British Colonial government. Over the course of his government career he served in the ministries of finance, health and commerce, and was head of service in the former Eastern Region, Nigeria. He was part of the Constituent Assembly of 1977-78 that worked on the 1979 Constitution of Nigeria (Second Republic) and served as the official Constitutional Adviser, to the Eastern Nigerian delegation to the Nigerian Constitutional Conference in London. Udoji was also the first Nigerian to serve as Chairman of a multinational corporation in Nigeria and his success in that position opened the way to other Nigerians: Christopher Abebe in UAC, Michael Omolayole in Lever Brothers, Gamaliel Onosode in Cadbury and Jamodu in PZ. He helped found the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and served as its first Chairman from 1981 to 1986 in conjunction with his service as the second Chairman of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) from 1982 to 1987. Between 1974 and 1993, he was either the chairman or on the board of at least 13 major corporations, including Citibank Nigeria, The Nigerian Tobacco Company, R.T. Briscoe, Michellin, Motor Tyre Service Company, Wiggins Teape, Udoji United F.C., and Solgas Petroleum. He played a pivotal role in the shaping of the post-civil war history of Nigeria. A celebrated administrator, teacher, lawyer and businessman, Udoji, also positively impacted other countries of the African continent, during his eventful life as a United Nations consultant. For his contributions he received numerous honors and traditional titles including having schools, roads, and a government building named in his honor. In 1995 he published his memoirs, titled \\"Under Three Masters\\" and some of his speeches and correspondences as, Which Way Nigeria?: Selected Speeches of Chief J.O. Udoji (2000, Ibadan, Spectrum). Upon His passing, Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State stated \\"Udoji was a legend, a selfless Nigerian and a devout Christian who took care of the down-trodden, the widows and the poor. His death will create a lacuna that will be very difficult to fill.\\"  Early life and education  Udoji was born in 1912 to the Ezemba-Dogbu Udoji family in Ozubulu, Ekusigo LGA of Anambra State. He held the title of Igwe in Ozubulu. A man of great learning and vast experience, Udoji started formal education at St. Michael's Catholic School, Ozubulu (1920‚Äì26), went to St. Charles Training College, Onitsha (1929‚Äì31) before heading to Kings College, Cambridge University, England (1945‚Äì48) and being called to the Bar, Gray's Inn, London in 1948. He was also at the World Bank, Washington between 1955 and 1956. Udoji received a graduate and post graduate degree from Cambridge University. Prior to attending King's College in Cambridge, he worked as a teacher in schools in the Eastern and Western region including Ibadan Grammar School and Abeokuta Grammar School. He also served the secretary in charge of the Western Nigerian provinces.  Public service  On his return from England, Udoji joined the Colonial Administrative Service and was made an assistant district officer in Ado Ekiti before being posted as district officer for Egbado. As colonial administrative officer he had a distinguished service in Ondo and Abeokuta provinces of the country. In 1954, he was transferred to the Eastern region and made the permanent secretary in the ministries of Health, Commerce, Finance and Establishments. In 1959, Udoji's exemplary dedication to duty, his remarkable intellectual capacity and his integrity made him rise up to the level of Head of the Region‚Äôs civil service, Chief Secretary to the Premier of the Eastern Region, Dr Michael Okpara, as well as Secretary to the Executive Council. He remained in that position until the 1966 Nigerian coup d'√©tat. Following the coup he went into private legal practice (1966‚Äì68) and served as a Ford Foundation Consultant in Administration and Management (1968‚Äì72). In 1972, during Nigeria's oil boom period, he was assigned by the Yakubu Gowon administration to head a review commission of the civil service standards and compensation in the country. The commission made recommendations such as an increase in the salaries of public servants, civil servants training, a unified and integrated administrative structure, elimination of waste and removal of inefficient departments and introduction of an efficient civil service on the basis of management by objective. The commission also recommended the establishment of an Ombudsman in the country. The commission's report was portrayed in subsequent years as a salary review commission though the original intent was to study and make sweeping recommendations on the public service including the recommendation of an objective or goal oriented management style. This salary increases are known today as the \\"Udoji Award\\".  International Service  Widely traveled, Udoji served as the Chairman of the Africanisation Commission of the East African Community, covering Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania (1963). He also served as a consultant to the United Nations Conference on the Management of Public Enterprises held in Yugoslavia (1969), and served in Swaziland (1970) as sole Commissioner for the country's Localization Commission, functioned as Secretary-General of the African Association for Public Administration and Management (1972‚Äì75) and was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to review and re-organise Uganda's Public Service in 1991. He was part of the Constituent Assembly of 1977-78 that worked on the 1979 Constitution of Nigeria and was also President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) from 1981 to 1986 and President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) from 1982 to 1987.  Business Career and Family  In the Nigerian first republic, Udoji represented the regional governments in some of the latter's financial concerns such as Hotel Presidential, Enugu and Port Harcourt and Independence Breweries, Umuahia.

He completed his pilot training in the United States of America. Upon returning to Britain, he joined No. 122 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Turnhouse, and flew Spitfires. With the squadron he flew patrols over the Firth of Forth. He moved with them when they were reposted to RAF Hornchurch in the south of England. He then flew sorties over northern France. In July 1942, Giddings flew from the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, situated in the Mediterranean, to Malta. In August he joined No. 246 Squadron RAF and provided air support for the convoys involved in Operation Pedestal. On 1 October 1942, he was regraded to the rank of Pilot Officer on probation. During that month he flew as many as four sorties a day, and shot down at least two enemy aircraft, including an Italian Macchi C.202, and damaged numerous others. He was involved in the defence of the island from the Axis powers until November 1942, when he was injured during an accident. He was taking off when a truck appeared on the runway in front of him. He crashed into it at high speed and broke a wrist and an arm. He then returned to England to recuperate. On 1 November 1943 he was promoted to Flight Lieutenant, and on 1 September 1945 this was made permanent. He later was given seniority from 1 September 1945. During the summer of 1944, he was made a flight commander in No. 118 Squadron RAF. With them he flew the Spitfire IX.

He then spent five years as a Staff Officer at RAF Fighter Command, during which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1952 Birthday Honours. He was then appointed as Commanding Officer of a wing based at RAF Waterbeach. He held this position from 1954 to 1956. He was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1956, as part of the new-year promotions, and was awarded a Bar to his AFC the following day. His next appointment was to Central Fighter Establishment and he commanded their tactics wing. His next flying role was as Commanding Officer of No. 57 Squadron RAF that flew the Handley Page Victor.

Later life and death Giddings was an independent panel inspector with the Department of Environment between 1979 and 1991. During this time he presided over many inquiries concerning motorway expansion. He presided over the year-long inquiry in May 1982 concerning the extension of the M1 motorway to link with the A1(M). At the time it was the longest inquiry ever held. He also chaired the inquiry concerning the Archway Road A1 extension in North London. The expansion would have led to the demolition of almost 200 houses and was strongly opposed. During this inquiry he and his family received a number of threats and an attack on their home. This led to Gidding's resignation from the department in 1991. Giddings died on 5 April 2009. Personal life In 1946 he married Elizabeth McConnell, who survived him. They had four children; two sons, and two daughters. Giddings was an accomplished pianist.

During the 1950s and 1960s, several different priorities from different agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, a competing railroad with the Erie, wanted to condense (along with the Erie) services and share trackage because of financial troubles. Secondly, the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city, which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops. This, however, was not implemented during the 1950s, as proposed. Instead, the Erie reconstructed the stations at downtown Passaic and Clifton.Yanosey, pg 40 However, although its on the same alignment, the station at Lake View, the 1885 depot was not replaced and remained in use until 1963. Third, the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights-of-way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic (right where Passaic Park station and BE Drawbridge were located). The Lake View station site in the late winter of 2011 After the merge on October 17, 1960, between the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Erie, the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street, Passaic. This time, the newly formed Erie-Lackawanna went forward with it, beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch through Lyndhurst, Passaic and Clifton. The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill, and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position, and soon put up for sale price of $0.00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic. After the abandonment, Lake View station, along with Clifton, Passaic and Passaic Park stations were abandoned and the tracks torn up. Although all the passenger trains were re- routed through Passaic and Clifton along the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Boonton Branch, portions of the track from XW Tower in Paterson to Lake View were to be retained for use by freights. , the tracks remain through Lake View, but the station itself has been removed since Autumn 1967.

Its plot is based on the Byzantine-Arab conflict (7th‚Äì12th centuries) and describes in political verse the efforts of a young Byzantine akrite warrior to rescue his father from captivity. Date and text The Song of Armouris is written in unrhymed fifteen-syllable political verse,Horrocks (1996), p. 153 and consists of 197 lines.Beaton (1996) p. 47 There are two surviving manuscripts of the ballad, one in St. Petersburg dating to the 15th or 16th century, and one in the Topkapi Palace collection in Istanbul dated 1461. Thus far, only the St. Petersburg text has been published in full.Beck (1971), p. 55Beaton (2004), p. 205 The texts of the two manuscripts are remarkably similar to each other, ruling out a provenance from a contemporary oral tradition, but it is clear that the text derives from earlier oral sources.Beaton (1996) p. 44 From its linguistic features and content the poem probably dates from the 11th century, making it one of the oldest surviving Byzantine heroic poems and one of the earliest evidences for the modern Greek vernacular.Markopoulos (2008), pp. 171, 258 Plot summary The plot describes the campaign of a young man, named Arestis or Armouris Armouropoulos (\\"son of Armouris\\"). Although under-age, he accomplishes feats of strength, required by his mother for him to ride on his father's stallion. Crossing the Euphrates with the aid of an angel, he fights an army of Saracens (Arabs) single-handed, \\"for a day and a night\\". He is victorious, but gets unhorsed and loses his mace in an ambush. He pursues the Saracen who captured the horse into Syria. Upon reaching him, Armouris cuts off his arm and orders him to go to his emir and announce his arrival. When Armouris' father, who is being held captive by the Saracens, sees the horse, he recognizes it and assumes that his son is dead.Petsopoulos (2001), p. 20Beck (1971), p. 53Beaton (2004) p. 82 The Saracen emir, whose chivalry is exemplary, reassures the father and orders a search to be made for the missing son. The father writes to him to cease slaughtering Saracens, so that he will be treated with mercy, but Armouris refuses unless his father is freed, and threatens to rampage across Syria. The Emir, alarmed, finally agrees to let Armouris' father go and offers him his daughter in marriage in order to secure peace.Beaton (2004) p. 83 Contents and style The Byzantine-Arab conflicts that lasted from the mid-7th to the early 11th century provide the context for Byzantine heroic (\\"acritic\\", from the akritai border guards) poetry, written in the vernacular Greek language. Along with the better-known epic romance Digenis Akritas, the Song of Armouris ranks among the most important and oldest of these works. Various hypotheses have been made on the origin of the main character's name and the events that inspired the original poem. The Byzantinist Henri Gr√©goire, who dated the work to the 9th century, proposed that the poem reflects the aftermath of the Arab sack of Amorion in 838, and that Armouris is Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867), during whose reign the Arab raids into Anatolia were decisively beaten back (at the Battle of Lalakaon in 863). According to Gr√©goire's interpretation, the one- armed Saracen of the song is Umar al-Aqta (\\"Umar the one-handed\\"), the emir of Melitene who was defeated and killed at Lalakaon.Kazhdan (1991), p. 183Beck (1971), p. 54 G. Veloudis on the other hand equated Armouris with Umar himself, believing that tales of him survived in Byzantine folk legend, and that in subsequent times, when the exact circumstances were no longer known, the emir, whose title was rendered as amiras in Greek, became Armouris.Beck (1971), pp. 54‚Äì55 Although Armouris' plot is complex, the narrative is fast- moving and lively. And while the style is plain it has considerable descriptive power. The poem contains much of the formulaic texture of oral poetry. According to its style, the original composition of the Song of Armouris may well date to an earlier period than Digenis Akritas, since features of oral epic composition and a certain archaic poetical economy found there are more marked.Petsopoulos (2001), p. 21 See also * Digenes Akritas * Acritic songs ReferencesSources * * * * * * * External links *Œ§Œø Œ¨œÉŒºŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒëœÅŒºŒøœçœÅŒ∑.

He was replaced by Patrick Abba Moro in the cabinet announced in July 2011. Early career Iheanacho was born in Imo State. He attended the University of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom where he obtained a Master of Science degree in International Transport, and also earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in General Management from the University of Bradford. He joined the navy, retiring with the rank of Captain. Business career Iheanacho's latest position as Chairman of Poseidon Commodities Trading Ltd. in London ended in legal disputes with employees and was handled by the Employment tribunal in London. Iheanacho became Managing Director of Genesis Worldwide Shipping Company, and Chairman/CEO of Integrated Oil and Gas. As Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shipping Companies Association, in July 2004 he praised the cabotage law that had been passed a few years earlier, but called for a more consistent policy and greater financial support from the government to build up the Nigerian shipping industry, including creation of a national carrier. As Vice President of the Indigenous Ship Owners Association of Nigeria, in August 2007 he praised the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, and called for stability in its leadership. Iheanacho gained international visibility at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development where he was an external consultant on global shipping and marine transportation. Speaking in February 2010 about a report from the International Maritime Bureau which ranked Nigeria second only to Somalia in terms of piracy risk, he called for a stronger naval presence in coastal waters. In March 2010 he called for deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry, and criticized the N700 billion annual subsidies to this sector which he said were appropriated before providing any benefit to the people. Political career Iheanacho was nominated for a ministerial position in November 2008, despite criticism that he is from the same town as Kema Chikwe, Nigeria's ambassador to Ireland, and Chuka Odum, then Minister of State for Environment, Housing and Urban Development. Later his nomination was dropped. He was again nominated for a ministerial position in March 2010, and was said to be the choice of the National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Vincent Ogbulafor. Shortly after being appointed Minister of Interior, Iheanacho toured the Medium Security Prison in Kuje, Abuja, where he found many unfinished projects and demanded action. He also said his ministry would work with the ministry of justice to speed up the trials of over 30,000 prison inmates still waiting trial, and to allow for release of inmates who had nor been tried after three or more years in jail. In April 2010 he inaugurated the Nigeria Civil Defence College for Peace Disaster Management, Katsina, an institution for training security personnel. On 18 April 2011, the Jonathan administration suspended Iheanacho from his post as Minister of Interior one day after Jonathan had been reelected. The reason was said to be \\"a number of lapses in the political leadership of the ministry traceable to his personal and official conduct\\". The decision to suspend rather than dismiss the minister was unusual, but was not immediately explained.

In some vertebrates (including humans before puberty) it is composed of three parts: the ilium, ischium, and the pubis. The two hip bones join at the pubic symphysis and together with the sacrum and coccyx (the pelvic part of the spine) comprise the skeletal component of the pelvis ‚Äì the pelvic girdle which surrounds the pelvic cavity. They are connected to the sacrum, which is part of the axial skeleton, at the sacroiliac joint. Each hip bone is connected to the corresponding femur (thigh bone) (forming the primary connection between the bones of the lower limb and the axial skeleton) through the large ball and socket joint of the hip. Structure The hip bone is formed by three parts: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. At birth, these three components are separated by hyaline cartilage. They join each other in a Y-shaped portion of cartilage in the acetabulum. By the end of puberty the three regions will have fused together, and by the age 25 they will have ossified. The two hip bones join each other at the pubic symphysis. Together with the sacrum and coccyx, the hip bones form the pelvis. Ilium Ilium (plural ilia) is the uppermost and largest region. It makes up two fifths of the acetabulum. It is divisible into two parts: the body and the ala or wing of ilium; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum. The body of ilium forms the sacroiliac joint with the sacrum. The edge of the wing of ilium forms the S-shaped iliac crest which is easily located through the skin. The iliac crest shows clear marks of the attachment of the three abdominal wall muscles. Ischium The ischium forms the lower and back part of the hip bone and is located below the ilium and behind the pubis. The ischium is the strongest of the three regions that form the hip bone. It is divisible into three portions: the body, the superior ramus, and the inferior ramus. The body forms approximately one-third of the acetabulum. The ischium forms a large swelling, the tuberosity of the ischium, also referred to colloquially as the \\"sit bone\\". When sitting, the weight is frequently placed upon the ischial tuberosity. The gluteus maximus covers it in the upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position. Pubis The pubic region or pubis is the ventral and anterior of the three parts forming the hip bone. It is divisible into a body, a superior ramus, and an inferior ramus. The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum. The body forms the wide, strong, medial and flat portion of the pubic bone which unites with the other pubic bone in the pubic symphysis. The fibrocartilaginous pad which lies between the symphysial surfaces of the coxal bones, that secures the pubic symphysis, is called the interpubic disc. Pelvic brim The pelvic brim is a continuous oval ridge of bone that runs along the pubic symphysis, pubic crests, arcuate lines, sacral alae, and sacral promontory.Multiple citations to \\"(J Bridges)\\" embedded in text. False pelvis, pelvic inlet, and ramus The false pelvis is that portion superior to the pelvic brim; it is bounded by the alae of the ilia laterally and the sacral promontory and lumbar vertebrae posteriorly. The true pelvis is the region inferior to the pelvic brim that is almost entirely surrounded by bone. The pelvic inlet is the opening delineated by the pelvic brim. The widest dimension of the pelvic inlet is from left to right, that is, along the frontal plane. The pelvic outlet is the margin of the true pelvis. It is bounded anteriorly by the pubic arch, laterally by the ischia, and posteriorly by the sacrum and coccyx. The superior pubic ramus is a part of the pubic bone which forms a portion of the obturator foramen. It extends from the body to the median plane where it articulates with its fellow of the opposite side. It is conveniently described in two portions: a medial flattened part and a narrow lateral prismoid portion. The inferior pubic ramus is thin and flat. It passes laterally and downward from the medial end of the superior ramus. It becomes narrower as it descends and joins with the inferior ramus of the ischium below the obturator foramen. Development and sexual dimorphism Plan of ossification of the hip bone. Left hip bone, external surface. The hip bone is ossified from eight centers: three primary, one each for the ilium, ischium, and pubis, and five secondary, one each for the iliac crest, the anterior inferior spine (said to occur more frequently in the male than in the female), the tuberosity of the ischium, the pubic symphysis (more frequent in the female than in the male), and one or more for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum. The centers appear in the following order: in the lower part of the ilium, immediately above the greater sciatic notch, about the eighth or ninth week of fetal life; in the superior ramus of the ischium, about the third month; in the superior ramus of the pubis, between the fourth and fifth months. At birth, the three primary centers are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum, the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis being still cartilaginous. By the seventh or eighth year, the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium are almost completely united by bone. About the thirteenth or fourteenth year, the three primary centers have extended their growth into the bottom of the acetabulum, and are there separated from each other by a Y-shaped portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two or more centers. One of these, the os acetabuli, appears about the age of twelve, between the ilium and pubis, and fuses with them about the age of eighteen; it forms the pubic part of the acetabulum. The ilium and ischium then become joined, and lastly the pubis and ischium, through the intervention of this Y-shaped portion. The male pelvis, formed by left and right hip bones, sacrum, and coccyx. The female pelvis is wider than the male pelvis to accommodate childbirth. At about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of the remaining portions, and they join with the rest of the bone between the twentieth and twenty-fifth years. Separate centers are frequently found for the pubic tubercle and the ischial spine, and for the crest and angle of the pubis. The proportions of the female hip bone may affect the ease of passage of the baby during childbirth. Muscle attachments Several muscles attach to the hip bone including the internal muscles of the pelvic, abdominal muscles, back muscles, all the gluteal muscles, muscles of the lateral rotator group, hamstring muscles, two muscles from the anterior compartment of the thigh. Abdominal muscles *The abdominal external oblique muscle attaches to the iliac crest. *The abdominal internal oblique muscle attaches to pecten pubis. *The transversus abdominis muscle attaches to the pubic crest and pecten pubis via a conjoint tendon Back muscles *The multifidus muscle in the sacral region attaches to the medial surface of posterior superior iliac spine, the posterior sacroiliac ligaments and several places to the sacrum. Gluteal muscles *The gluteus maximus muscle arises from the posterior gluteal line of the inner upper ilium, and the rough portion of bone including the iliac crest, the fascia covering the gluteus medius (gluteal aponeurosis), as well as the sacrum, coccyx, the erector spinae (lumbodorsal fascia), the sacrotuberous ligament. *The gluteus medius muscle: originates on the outer surface of the ilium between the iliac crest and the posterior gluteal line above, and the anterior gluteal line below. The gluteus medius also originates from the gluteal aponeurosis that covers its outer surface. *Gluteus minimus muscle originates between the anterior and inferior gluteal lines, and from the margin of the greater sciatic notch. Lateral rotator group *The piriformis muscle originates from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament and part of the spine and sacrum. *The superior gemellus muscle arises from the outer surface of the ischial spine *The obturator internus muscle arises from the inner surface of the antero-lateral wall of the hip bone, where it surrounds the greater part of the obturator foramen, being attached to the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium, and at the side to the inner surface of the hip bone below and behind the pelvic brim, reaching from the upper part of the greater sciatic foramen above and behind to the obturator foramen below and in front. It also arises from the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane except in the posterior part, from the tendinous arch, and to a slight extent from the obturator fascia, which covers the muscle. *The inferior gemellus muscle arises from the upper part of the tuberosity of the ischium, immediately below the groove for the obturator internus tendon. *The obturator externus muscle arises from the margin of bone immediately around the medial side of the obturator foramen, from the rami of the pubis, and the inferior ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the medial two-thirds of the outer surface of the obturator membrane, and from the tendinous arch. Hamstrings *The long head biceps femoris arises from the lower and inner impression on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the semitendinosus, and from the lower part of the sacrotuberous ligament; *The semitendinosus arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps femoris; it also arises from an aponeurosis which connects the adjacent surfaces of the two muscles to the extent of about 7.5 cm. from their origin. *The semimembranosus arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium Anterior compartment of thigh *The rectus femoris muscle arises by two tendons: one, the anterior or straight, from the anterior inferior iliac spine; the other, the posterior or reflected, from a groove above the rim of the acetabulum. *The sartorius muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior iliac spine, Shoulder muscles *The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches to the iliac crest and several places on the spine and ribs. Clinical significance=Fractures Fractures of the hip bone are termed pelvic fractures, and should not be confused with hip fractures, which are actually femoral fractures that occur in the proximal end of the femur. Preparation for childbirth Pelvimetry is the assessment of the female pelvis in relation to the birth of a baby in order to detect an increased risk for obstructed labor. Evolution of the pelvis in animals The hip bone first appears in fishes, where it consists of a simple, usually triangular bone, to which the pelvic fin articulates. The hip bones on each side usually connect with each other at the forward end, and are even solidly fused in lungfishes and sharks, but they never attach to the vertebral column. In the early tetrapods, this early hip bone evolved to become the ischium and pubis, while the ilium formed as a new structure, initially somewhat rod-like in form, but soon adding a larger bony blade. The acetabulum is already present at the point where the three bones meet. In these early forms, the connection with the vertebral column is not complete, with a small pair of ribs connecting the two structures; nonetheless the pelvis already forms the complete ring found in most subsequent forms. In practice, modern amphibians and reptiles have substantially modified this ancestral structure, based on their varied forms and lifestyles. The obturator foramen is generally very small in such animals, although most reptiles do possess a large gap between the pubis and ischium, referred to as the thyroid fenestra, which presents a similar appearance to the obturator foramen in mammals. In birds, the pubic symphysis is present only in the ostrich, and the two hip bones are usually widely separated, making it easier to lay large eggs. In therapsids, the hip bone came to rotate counter-clockwise, relative to its position in reptiles, so that the ilium moved forward, and the pubis and ischium moved to the rear. The same pattern is seen in all modern mammals, and the thyroid fenestra and obturator foramen have merged to form a single space. The ilium is typically narrow and triangular in mammals, but is much larger in ungulates and humans, in which it anchors powerful gluteal muscles. Monotremes and marsupials also possess a fourth pair of bones, the prepubes or \\"marsupial bones\\", which extend forward from the pubes, and help to support the abdominal muscles and, in marsupials, the pouch. In placental mammals, the pelvis as a whole is generally wider in females than in males, to allow for the birth of the young. The pelvic bones of cetaceans were formerly considered to be vestigial, but they are now known to play a role in sexual selection.Dines, James P., et al. \\"Sexual selection targets cetacean pelvic bones.\\" Evolution 68.11 (2014): 3296-3306.

It was used as part of the island's defense in World War II. History This obscure former military strip became famous during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Originally used as an emergency landing field for fighter aircraft, in 1941 Haleiwa Field had only an unpaved landing strip and very austere conditions. Haleiwa Field was mainly used to simulate real battle conditions for gunnery training. Those on temporary duty there had to bring their own tents and equipment. On 26 January 1945 the 14th Naval Construction Battalion completed the airfield14th NCB, NHHC, Seabee Museum Archives, Port Hueneme, Ca with a paved runway and it became a busy reliever base for fighter aircraft patrolling the islands. A World War II era photo depicted a Bell P-39 taxiing past a temporary wooden control tower and another wooden building at Haleiwa. Pearl Harbor Attack On December 7 the Japanese heavily strafed the aircraft at Wheeler Field and few were able to get airborne to fend them off. Haleiwa was an auxiliary field to Wheeler and contained a collection of aircraft temporarily assigned to the field including aircraft from the 47th Fighter Squadron. A total of eight Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and 2 Curtiss P-36 Mohawk pursuit planes were at the field on the morning of December 7. 2nd Lt. George S. Welch and 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor, both P-40 pilots, were at Wheeler when the attack began. They had previously flown their P-40B fighters over to the small airfield at Haleiwa as part of a plan to disperse the squadron's planes away from Wheeler. Not waiting for instructions the pilots called ahead to Haleiwa and had both their fighters fueled, armed and warmed up. Both men raced in their cars to Haleiwa Field completing the 16-mile trip in about 15 minutes. With their P-40s, now warmed up and ready, they jumped into their cockpits. The crew chiefs informed them that they should disperse their planes. \\"The hell with that\\", said Welch. Ignoring the usual pre-takeoff checklists the aircraft took off down the narrow airstrip. Once in the air they spotted a large number of aircraft in the direction of Ewa and Pearl Harbor. Only then did they realize what they were up against. ‚ÄúThere were between 200 and 300 Japanese aircraft,\\" said Taylor; \\"there were just two of us!\\" The two P-40's engaged the aircraft attacking Ewa Mooring Mast and shot down five Japanese planes. They then returned to Wheeler to replenish their ammunition. While there, another wave of dive bombers appeared and Lt. Taylor raced back into the air. His P-40's cockpit was damaged as a Japanese plane chased him. Lt. Welch was able to down the plane following him and they both returned to Wheeler. Lt. Welch was credited with a total of four Japanese planes shot down and Lt. Taylor downed two. Just as suddenly as it began, the sky was empty of Japanese aircraft. Taylor and Welch were both awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Welch and Taylor's dramatic ride and takeoff were shown in the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora! A total of nine Japanese aircraft were shot down by pilots from the Haleiwa field during the Pearl Harbor attack, four by 2nd Lt. Welch and two by 2nd Lt. Taylor, who flew P-40B Tomahawks equipped with twin .50 caliber machine guns. Flying P-36A gunnery trainers stripped of their .50 caliber machine gun and equipped only with a single .30 caliber machine gun to be used for target training, 1st Lieutenant Lewis M. Sanders was credited with shooting down one of the attacking Japanese aircraft, while 2nd Lieutenants Harry W. Brown and Phillip M. Rasmussen were each being credited with shooting down the remaining two attacking aircraft. All five pilots were later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for their bravery and valor during the attack. Postwar use After the war Haleiwa Fighter Strip was reused as a civilian airport. It was apparently abandoned between 1947‚Äì1961. Little of Haleiwa Field remains today, although the area is not completely abandoned. The remains of the single runway that was paved during World War II can still be seen but the tarmac is severely compromised by weed growth. The area is currently being used as a motion picture location for various TV shows and movies. Homeless squatters have occupied camps in the heavily overgrown areas. On the north end of the runway still stands the foundation of the control tower and concrete slabs from building foundations. The land, called Puaena Point, remains undeveloped and is owned by Kamehameha Schools. Sometimes called \\"Police Beach\\", there was a proposal for development in 2000. It is marked on maps as Puaena Beach Park, but not easily accessible. An ancient surfing area around the point for experts, is accessed from Haleiwa Beach Park off of Kamehameha Highway, Hawaii Route 83.

The boy struggles with his sexual orientation as well as the need for honesty when his beloved role model asks him to lie. The book was a Lambda Literary Award finalist for LGBT Children's/Young Adult literature,Gonzalez, Antonio. \\"Finalists Announced for the 22nd Annual Lambda Literary Awards.\\" Lambda Literary Foundation.

March 1, 2010. This is the second young adult novel focusing on LGBTQ teens by author P. E. Ryan, whose first effort in the genre was 2008's Saints of Augustine.\\"Interview with Patrick Ryan/P.E. Ryan, the Author of Saints of Augustine and Send Me.\\" Ready When You Are, C.B. December 23, 2008. As Patrick Ryan, he wrote Send Me, a novel for adults. Plot synopsis The book is written in the first person singular from the perspective of its 15-year-old narrator, Garth Rudd. The Rudds live in Richmond, Virginia. Garth's father died in a boating accident two years earlier, leaving his middle-class family to shoulder his many debts. Now living on the edge of poverty, Garth's mother, Sonja, works two jobs to support the family and Garth tries to earn spending money and save for college by working as a janitor of sorts at a downtown department store for a condescending supervisor. Wanting to be a veterinarian when he is older, Garth volunteers at a local animal shelter caring for dogs and cats. Garth has repeated nightmares about his father's death, and is unhappy about his short height (he is only tall). Prior to the novel's opening (although this scene is related in flashback), Garth came out to his best friend, Lisa, about his homosexuality. Shortly thereafter, Garth (in flashback) tells his mother that he is gay. But his mother, worried that her short, slight teenage son might be gay bashed, tells Garth not to tell anyone else that he is gay. The novel opens when Mike Rudd, the twin brother of Garth's deceased father, arrives at the Rudd home. Mrs. Rudd and Lisa are somewhat cold and distant toward Mike, but Mike and Garth immediately become friends. Mike also realizes Garth is gay, and on a shopping trip Mike takes Garth into a gay bookstore. Garth meets an openly gay classmate, Adam Walters, in the store, and Mike arranges for Garth and Mike to watch a DVD of the motion picture Beautiful Thing together at the Rudd house. A short time later, Mike convinces Garth to go with him on a trip to a shopping mall in a suburb of Richmond where he intends to solicit donations to fight the disease \\"meninosis.\\" Garth quickly realizes that \\"meninosis\\" is not a real disease, but the presence of the boyish-looking Garth helps Mike raise hundreds of dollars in donations. Mike promises to give Garth a cut of the money, and Garth quits his job. Garth begins to feel guilty over the large number of lies he tells his mother and Lisa to cover up both what he is doing with Mike and his relationship with Adam. Garth justifies his actions by assuring himself that the money he is getting will go into his college fund and make his mother worry less, and that his mother's demand that he remain closeted is unjust. Mike's cons become more elaborate. He successfully convinces Garth to wear an old Scooby-Doo Halloween costume (which still fits, because Garth has not grown much taller in the past several years). He also successfully gets Garth to take two dogs from the animal shelter as well as his own elderly dog, Hutch, with them on a fundraising trip. They pretend to be raising money for a disease which strikes dogs. Adam and Garth watch the movie Chinatown together, and kiss. Shortly thereafter, Mike takes Garth to a run-down section of Richmond where Mike recruits a beautiful blonde woman and a bar patron to help with his latest scam. Mike rents a sports car and pretends to raffle off the vehicle at the Virginia State Fair. Adam, also visiting the fair, sees Garth with his uncle. When the scam goes wrong, Mike, Garth, and the beautiful woman are forced to flee the scene. Upset that she was duped to participate in a con, the woman sends her boyfriend to the Rudd house to confront Mike. Mike escapes the house, leaving Garth to defend himself against the angry man. Garth's mother witnesses the confrontation, and Garth is forced to tell the truth about what he and Mike have been doing. The novel concludes with Garth having to own up to his actions and resolve his conflicts with his mother. Garth must also come to terms with his Uncle Mike's cowardice and lies, and struggles to repair his friendships with Lisa and Adam. The novel contains a number of references to non-fiction people, things, and places, like the singer Sufjan Stevens, the films Beautiful Thing and Chinatown, the cartoon characters Scooby-Doo and Superman, and to places in and around Richmond, Virginia. It also mentions the Richmond Organization for Sexual Minority Youth (ROSMY), a real organization which offers support and leadership for LGBTQ youth in the Richmond area. Critical reception The reviewer in the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books was highly laudatory, noting that \\"Garth's relationship with Mike is the perfect catalyst for his coming of age: it allows him to put aside his childish expectations about ideal relationships in favor of an understanding of adults as complex, flawed people. [Details in the book] become symbols for the various aspects of hiding, immaturity, fear, compromise, and insight that accompany Garth's circuitous route to maturity with honor, making this a rich and offbeat novel about a young man coming into his own both because of and in spite of his family.\\"Coats, Karen. \\"In Mike We Trust (Review).\\" Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books. 62:8 (April 2009) p. 334.

Notable projects Slorach Residence Construction Date: 2009 The encompassing living environment of the Hamilton Courtyard House is achieved through the union of built form, spatial sequences, landscape and scale. Winter Park Winter Park, Doncaster, Victoria Construction Date: 1971 Winter Park was Graeme's first cluster housing project. It was designed and implemented in association with Merchant Builders Pty Ltd in 1971 and has subsequently remained a seminal departure from the traditional method of suburban subdivision. Winter Park is now on the Heritage Victoria list and in 2007 was adjudged by an expert panel, consisting mostly of architects, as one of the 29 most worthy buildings produced since the inauguration of the first AIA awards. The basic tenet of the cluster housing concept is that of a comprehensively planned development in which a group of houses are sited to optimise available land in a much more efficient and environmentally sensitive manner than that provided by the normal rectangular grid lot suburban subdivision. Excess land is aggregated to provide communal open space. Houses are sited to relate sympathetically with each other, to optimise privacy, solar orientation, views and physical conditions. The Plumbers & Gasfitters Union Building Plumbers and Gasfitters building front facade. Gunn, Graeme Construction Date: 1970 Located at 52 Victoria Street Melbourne, the Plumbers & Gasfitters Union building is known as the most persisting and noticeable landmark of Brutalism. The building was completed in 1970 by Graeme Gunn and his creative collaboration with Merchant Builders and landscape architect Ellis Stones.Architect Victoria RAIA VIC awards 2007, 54 The design itself was architecturally intended to be up to date.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p199 The facade is formed of concrete in bold expressionistic forms with dark smoked glazing that intensify the sculptural quality of the construction.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p203 Structurally designed to receive an extra floor when needed, the building consists of a car parking and mechanical services area, one main office floor housing the clients, conference room and lobby, and one office of lettable space.Architect , volume 3 number 14, August 1971 For the internal finishes, walls, concrete block work, and stud frame sheeted with plywood are painted. The addition of signage on the building is slightly unsympathetic to the building's initial character. Baronda Residence Baronda residence under construction. Gunn, Graeme Construction Date: 1968 The design is based on a 2700 orthogonal matrix using natural tree trunks, some 10 metres long farmed from a local plantation owned by Sir Roy Grounds and Ken Myer. The vertical and horizontal grid of the matrix defines the spaces, the floors of which radiate from the central staircase, each floor raise a half level above the previous and in a location 90-degree different from the one below. Services are minimal, there being no public utilities (gas, water, electricity or sewerage). The timber theme generated by the structure is continued with infill timber studs within the pole grid and clad internally and externally with timber boarding. The floors are EX 50x100 mm tongue and grooved planks spanning 1350 mm. These, in turn form the ceilings for those rooms having a full height below. Ceilings directly below the roof consist of sisal lining over 150mm square wire mesh. Some years ago the owner of this property and some of adjacent properties along the coast deeded the contiguous properties as part of a state park to the NSW government to ensure retention of the pristine coastal environment, reserved for public use only. Townhouses - 76 Molesworth Street, Kew Molesworth Street. Gunn Graeme Construction Date: 1968 Designed for family living these six concrete block, Brutalist style townhouses, consist of three bedrooms, two living areas and a double carport (now converted to a garage) with an open private courtyard.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p201 The building expresses simple construction materials of concrete for the main structure, timber for the roof structure and metal deck as the roof cladding. Off-form concrete balconies project from the concrete block building, with timber handrails.Architecture in Australia Townhouses, 76 Molesworth Street, Kew, Victoria, Volume 59, Number 5, October 1970. The Townhouses are significant as an important design progression in the re-thinking of suburban, cluster style living. The houses are included on the Schedule to the Heritage Overlay and Graded as \\"A\\" class. Today: This project retains many of its original features and remains structurally intact, and has only received minor upgrading of timber handrails and window frames.

In a career spanning 60 years, he is best known for his contributions to project housing with Pettit and Sevitt, the Wilkinson Award-winning Woolley House in Mosman, and his longstanding partnership with Sydney Ancher and Bryce Mortlock. He is regarded as being a prominent figure in the development of the Sydney School movement and Australian vernacular building.Ancher/Mortlock/Woolley website Retrieved 2010-04-14.  Personal life  Ken Woolley was born in Sydney on 29 May 1933. He attended Sydney Boys‚Äô High School and studied architecture at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1955. On graduation, he worked in the Government Architects Branch of the New South Wales Public Works Department. During this time he was the design architect for the Fisher Library at the University of Sydney and the State Office Block (now demolished). He joined Ancher Mortlock Murray & Woolley in 1964, just prior to Ancher's retirement. This practice has received all the major architectural awards and created numerous outstanding buildings which include the Australian Embassy in Bangkok, Town Hall House Sydney, the Park Hyatt at Campbell's Cove, the ABC Radio and Orchestra Centre at Ultimo, the Victorian State Library, the Control Tower at Sydney Airport, the Olympics and RAS Dome Exhibition and Indoor Sports Halls, the Olympic Hockey Stadium, the Sydney Convention Centre, Darling Harbour and the refurbishment of the Queen Victoria Building. The most recent recognition was to the State Library of Victoria with the 2006 Lachlan Macquarie Award for Heritage Architecture.

Woolley took on a growing number of outside projects while still working with the Government Architect. He generated a reputation in the field of housing, winning a low cost competition for an exhibition house with Michael Dysart, in 1958. Consequently, both architects were invited to submit designs for a display village of model project houses in Carlingford, in 1961, proving to be a successful event that signalled the architect designed project house to be a welcome alternative to the individually designed and standard range houses of the time. He began a working relationship with the project housing company, Pettit and Sevitt, the same year, creating house types of high quality design and construction.Australian Architects: Ken Woolley, Royal Australian Institute of Architects, 1985. pp. 15 \\"Split Level\\", \\"Lowline\\" and other early forms incorporated design principles through simple lines, natural features and an emphasis on functionalism. They were widely affordable due to the standardised usage of materials: brick veneer construction, Gyprock plasterboard interior wall cladding, Monier concrete tiles and Stegbar aluminium windows. They often used basic grids, rectangular planes, and flat roofs, and were always firmly grounded with room to be easily adapted to various sites and terrains.Archive relating to Pettit & Sevitt project homes, 1962‚Äì1977 Retrieved 2010-04-14. These sophisticated types underwent various levels of modifications as they were marketed through display villages and later sold to individual buyers, who had a consultation with the architect to discuss the interior and exterior details, as a part of the service. Through these modifications based on the clients‚Äô needs and clever marketing, these houses gained an unprecedented popularity with prominent architects worldwide. An axonometric drawing detailing the sidestepping walls of the Woolley House in Mosman. At the completion of the Woolley House in Mosman in 1962, a work he would become most famous for, Ken Woolley emerged as a leading figure in a regional romantic movement often referred to as Sydney School. This new movement combined the influence of organic architecture, brutalism and the arts and crafts movement together with elements of the International Style, and came to embody the harmonious relationships between man and nature as intimate domestic spaces in the Australian bushland. The basis of the Woolley House design was derived from a series of garden terraces, most of which were covered by sections of timber roof sloping parallel to the land. A geometric order was applied to the plan as a series of 12-foot square units that combine to make up the main central space. Natural materials were exploited, with neutral colour schemes of dark tiles, western red cedar boarding and panelling, and painted bricks, creating a feeling of warmth in the house. The open plan living spaces were connected with volumes containing variations of ceiling height and changes in direction, enabling floor areas to be narrow but for the feeling of space to still be maximised. The house won RAIA‚Äôs Wilkinson Award the same year it was completed. The house was gifted to the University of NSW in 2016 by the Hesketh family. Woolley joined the existing partnership of Sydney Ancher, Bryce Mortlock and Stuart Murray in 1964, and with Murray leaving the practice in 1975, as Ancher Mortlock & Woolley, the team went on to establish a reputation in the design of special purpose buildings. Notable examples are the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Ultimo Centre, the RAS Dome and Exhibition Hall and the Olympic Hockey Stadium at Homebush. In addition, Ken Woolley worked on notable concrete buildings (Newcastle University Union building and Macquarie University Union building), multi-housing projects (The Penthouses, Darling Point 1967) and buildings of structure and technology (Town Hall House and the Guided Missile Launching System Repair Facility), with many of them picking up various esteemed awards over the following two decades.Australian Architects: Ken Woolley, Royal Australian Institute of Architects, 1985. pp. 17 Among his many notable buildings in Sydney are the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Ultimo, the Garvan Institute of Medical Research building in Darlinghurst (featuring an iconic DNA-inspired helical staircase), Sydney University's Fisher Library, the Park Hyatt Sydney, the former State Office Block and buildings on the Olympic site. There is also the Victorian State Library and the Australian Embassy in Bangkok. Woolley was awarded the highest architectural honour in Australia when he received the RAIA Gold Medal in 1993.

Poor, of Maine, The New York Times, September 8, 1871, page 2 He was the older brother of Henry Varnum Poor of Standard & Poor's, who was his partner in some business ventures. John Poor was an articulate man standing 6 feet, two inches (1.9 m) tall and weighing over 250 pounds (110 kg). He learned the geography and commerce of northern New England during travels as a young man; and developed an early appreciation for the potential of railroads. His commanding presence was enhanced by early speaking experience as a teacher and attorney. He had a unique ability to assemble the necessary resources to build early railroads, although he left the routine work of operations to others. Early life John Poor was born in Andover, Maine to Dr. Silvanus Poor and Mary (Merrill) Poor. He became a school teacher at Bethel, Maine before undertaking the study of law. He was admitted to the Maine Bar in 1834 and established a law practice in Bangor, Maine with his brother Henry Varnum Poor. John Poor was inspired by his first viewing of a steam locomotive on the Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1834. Railroads John Poor promoted the concept of a railroad from Montreal to Portland, Maine. Montreal would gain access to an ice-free seaport while the Saint Lawrence River was frozen; and Portland would gain commercial opportunities from the transfer of Canadian exports in its harbor. Portland writer, critic, and investor, John Neal wrote of the necessity \\"to drive Boston out of the business and secure [a] monopoly.\\" Poor's vision was realized when Portland became the winter seaport of the transcontinental Grand Trunk Railway. The Montreal Board of Trade weighed the benefits of rail connection to Portland or Boston. Portland was 100 miles closer to Montreal and Portland was a half day closer to European ports; but Portland's population of 16,000 could hardly offer the financial support for railroad construction promised by Boston businessmen. As Boston representatives presented their case, John Poor made a legendary 300-mile (500-km) trip through the White Mountains during a February blizzard. Poor left Portland shortly after midnight February 5, 1845, but the wind driven snow made it very difficult to follow the road. His sleigh covered only 7.5 miles (12.5 km) to Falmouth, Maine in three hours. After breakfast at Leach's Tavern, he traveled 40 miles (65 km), and had frostbite on his nose and one ear by the time he reached South Paris, Maine at nightfall. He traveled to his home town of Andover on February 6, after obtaining help from residents of Rumford, Maine to break a path through snowdrifts higher than a horse's back. He then traveled another 40 miles (65 km) to reach Colebrook, New Hampshire, at midnight. Colebrook residents helped Poor carry his sleigh and lead the horses through Dixville Notch where howling winds formed a 20-foot snowdrift. Poor rested in Sherbrooke, Quebec before venturing forth through unbroken snow 18 inches (46 cm) deep in temperatures of -18 ¬∞F (-27 ¬∞C) and crossed the ice- covered Saint Lawrence river at dawn on February 9. After resting 3 hours in his Montreal hotel room, Poor addressed the Montreal Board of Trade as they considered a resolution in support of the railway to Boston. Poor convinced the Canadians to delay support of the railway to Boston, and subsequent debate resulted in approval of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad to Portland. Poor had frostbitten feet and developed pneumonia upon his return to Portland that spring. In 1846, Poor turned his attention to building locomotives for Portland's railway. After discussions with Norris Locomotive Works Poor organized, and became first president of, the Portland Company on August 8, 1846. Portland Company's locomotive erecting shops opened for business in October 1847. In 1849, John Poor purchased the American Railroad Journal, and his brother Henry Varnum Poor became manager and editor. Standard & Poor's traces its history back to this publication. John Poor began promoting a railway from Portland to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1850. He became a director of the European and North American Railway in 1867.New York Times July 19, 1867 The railway was completed a month after his death in 1871. He was president of the York and Cumberland Railroad in 1851, and president of the Penobscot and Kennebec Railroad in 1852. He died at his home in Portland, Maine, on September 6, 1871. He was president of the Portland, Rutland, Oswego and Chicago Railroad at the time.Eastern Argus Portland Maine September 6, 1871 His ambitious vision for Portland's rail connection with Chicago was never realized, but his European and North American Railway became the eastern end of the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Legacy The City of Portland passed the following resolutions in 1871 in respect to the memory of John A. Poor:Eastern Argus Portland Maine September 13, 1871 :\\"Resolved, that among the many laborious, energetic and far-seeing business men of Portland , to whom we are indebted for the consideration we now enjoy, both at home and abroad, the Honorable John A. Poor, who called away on Tuesday morning last, stood foremost - head and shoulders above the rest. :\\"As not merely a business man, but as a statesman, large-hearted, sagacious, indefatigable and self sacrificing, it was not for the present, but for the future, that he underwent such labor for nearly thirty years, as resulted in sudden death at the age of sixty-three, when the grandest of all his magnificent undertaking wanted but a few days of completion. :\\"Resolved, That to his labor, knowledge and foresight, we are indebted for the Atlantic & St. Lawrence Railway, now the Grand Trunk, whereby our valuation has nearly quadrupled since 1842, the season of our greatest depression and discouragement; :\\"For the opening of Commercial Street now lined on both sides with large business houses and resulting in the Marginal Way, one hundred feet in width, around our whole city, front and back, and over three miles in length, giving us an uninterrupted water front, worth million to us, in connection with our unrivaled harbor; :\\"For the opening of our Portland Works, where engines and cars of the best workmanship have been built, year after year in large numbers not only for the railroads of Maine, but for other and very distant regions, during the last twenty years; :\\"For the establishment of our Gas Works, after they had come to a full stop; And for much that has been done first and last for the flourishing Rochester Road, now on its way to New York; :\\"For the original movement, which resulted in the hydrographic survey of our state by that able and conscientious engineer, Walter Wells, whereby our whole country has been brought acquainted with the astonishing accumulation of water power within our territory for manufacturing purposes. :\\"Resolved, That to John A. Poor we are indebted for the project of out European and North American Railway, now nearly completed - as part of the Trans-continental and Inter- oceanic railway through Portland, Rutland, Oswego, and Chicago - which, had he lived, would soon be in successful operation, a great highway for the nations, opening the West, by a direct line, the nearest, safest and cheapest transportation, for five hundred million bushels of wheat which Baring Brothers have already provided a market for, and for whatever else the overflowing West may desire to be rid of; enriching the farmers and connecting the Old World with the New, China, Japan, and the East with all Europe, through our territory, leaving us to take toll both ways, and bringing the commercial world acquainted with our magnificent harbor, and our unequaled facilities for a large business; all the other enterprises mentioned, though successful, being but preliminary and subordinate to this, now so near its consummation. :\\"Resolved, That while we desire to bear sad testimony to the world of the departed, we cannot withhold our sympathy from his wife and child, thought we are aware that, for a season, their loss will be but aggravated by such evidence, because we believe that after a time it may be among the greatest of their earthly consolations.\\" The Liberty ship SS John A.

Pictures were taken 3.2 hours apart. Colombian Rainforest Distribution and habitat This sub-species, being the northernmost rainbow boa, is found in rainforests and drier coastal clearings in its range; southern Central America, Trinidad & Tobago and northern South America. More semi-arboreal when young, rainbow boas may climb into trees and shrubs to forage and avoid land predators, however, they become mostly terrestrial with age.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. .  Behavior  Rainbow boas, like all boas in the family Boidae, are non-venomous snakes that subdue their prey with constriction. Like most Boids, they have special heat-sensing pits on their faces that allow them to detect the body heat of their warm-blooded prey.ANIMAL BYTES ‚Äî Boa Constrictor\\". Seaworld.org. Retrieved 2010-04-15. While nocturnal, they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are low. They are active at dawn and dusk and feed on small mammals, birds and lizards using their heat- sensing abilities to hunt in the low light. Most rainbow boas will never need a prey item larger than a large rat, as with most snakes, rainbow boas can expand their jaw to allow the consuming of items larger than the jaw would normally open (see snake skull). Wild rainbow boas may bite when they feel threatened, as a defense. This bite can be painful, but is not dangerous. Care must still be taken against infection. Like all snakes, when in a shed cycle they will be more unpredictable and irritable due to the added stress of shedding and clouded sight.  Reproduction  Rainbow boas are solitary, associating only to mate. Boas are polygynous and ovoviviparous, thus males may mate with multiple females and give birth to live young. Females invest considerable maternal energy in their offspring since their young develop within the mother's body. The young are able to develop in a thermo-regulated, protected environment and they are provided with nutrients. Young are born fully developed and independent within minutes of birth. Parthenogenesis The effects of central fusion and terminal fusion on heterozygosity Reproduction in snakes is almost exclusively sexual. Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex determining chromosomes and females a ZW pair. However, it was recently shown that E. maurus is capable of reproducing by facultative parthenogenesis resulting in production of WW female progeny. The WW females were likely produced by terminal automixis (see diagram), a type of parthenogenesis in which two terminal haploid products of meiosis fuse to form a zygote, which then develops into a daughter progeny. This is only the third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage. Captivity This species does very well in captivity and is considered by many to be the easiest of all the Epicrates sp., to maintain, requiring slightly less humidity than the Brazilian variant. They primarily feed on mice and rats. Commonly categorized as an 'Intermediate' species to keep by reptile distributors and breeders in the pet trade, they become quite tame with regular handling. The species \\"Epicrates cenchria\\" and primarily the sub-species E. c. cenchria (Brazilian Rainbow) and E. maurus (Colombian Rainbow) are growing in popularity and are widely bred in captivity with very few being imported. Breeders are attempting to produce a variety of different color and pattern \\"Morphs\\" through selective breeding. This is done by encouraging the dominant and recessive genes that code for proteins involved in chromatophore development, maintenance, or function. In January, 2015, a six-foot Epicrates maurus \\"slithered out of the toilet in an office restroom in downtown San Diego,\\" California; it was uncertain as to who may have been its owner.

After seeing the work of his countryman Edvard Munch work when it was exhibited in Kristiania, Normann wrote to Munch asking if he would exhibit his work in Berlin. Munch was so overcome that he packed up his exhibition on 20 October 1892 and went to Berlin where Normann befriended him. Munch's work was placed in an exhibition which caused such a stir that the painters in Berlin split into two societies.

It combines source routing with routing along a virtual ring, and is based on the idea of \\"pushing Chord into the underlay\\". Concepts=Virtual ring SSR operates on a flat address space which is organized as a virtual ring. This is a popular concept in peer-to-peer overlay networks like Chord. The common knowledge about the ring structure enables nodes to route packets without knowing the topology of the underlying physical network. While the physical network can be very dynamic, the structure of the virtual ring remains rather static. Therefore, flooding the physical network can be avoided. Packets travel along the ring so that they decrease the virtual distance to the destination (that is, the absolute difference of the addresses). When each node knows its correct predecessor and successor in the virtual ring, delivery to the correct receiving node is guaranteed. The ring is said to be consistent. Often, routing is assumed to have a defined orientation in the ring, but that is merely a help to simplify theory. In practice, this is not necessary and even detrimental to performance. The finger table in Chord, which provides shortcuts in the virtual ring, is replaced by a route cache. Source routing In the physical network SSR utilizes source routing. Relaying nodes opportunistically cache the traversed part of the source route of a given packet. This facilitates the collection of routing information while inhibiting polluting of the nodes' route caches with outdated information. Route aggregation A node does not need to have the complete path to the destination in its route cache to make use of a cache line. Instead, the message is routed towards the physical nearest node that makes progress in the virtual ring. When the message arrives at this intermediate node, that node adds information from its route cache to the source route. This step is repeated as needed. When the message arrives at the final destination, after path optimization (using Dijkstra's algorithm) a route update message is sent to the originator node, thus updating the originators route cache. This technique facilitates the usage of fixed size route caches, which limits the per-node state and makes SSR a viable option for low memory environments. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) functionality While SSR is a complete routing protocol (cf. OSI model's network layer), it also provides the semantics of a distributed hash table. This reduces the overhead to having an overlay protocol on top of a traditional routing protocol and greatly expedites lookup operations in MANETs which otherwise would rely on flooding, provided the application supports (or is modified to support) key-based routing. The provided DHT functionality also can be used to implement scalable network services in the absence of servers. Algorithm overview=Bootstrapping (starting the network) Every node periodically broadcasts a \\"hello\\" message to its physical neighbors, notifying the neighbors of its existence. \\"Hello\\" messages include a list of the physical neighbors of each node. If the node finds itself included in the \\"hello\\" message of another node, it assumes a bidirectional connection, and adds the other node to its list of physical peers (to later use them for routing). The node also sends a \\"neighbor notification\\" message to its assumed successor, to join the virtual ring. If the contacted node detects that it is not the correct successor, it replies with a message containing its best guess for the successor of the inquiring node. This is repeated until the correct virtual neighbors are found. (For a detailed description of this process, called ISPRP, see. Another way of bootstrapping is linearization.) alt=Drawing of a virtual ring (upper half) and a physical network graph (lower half) Routing When a node routes a message # it looks in its route cache. If a route to the destination exists, it is used. # and no route to the destination is known, the node routes the message to a virtually close predecessor of the destination. This intermediate node then repeats the routing process. # and the node's route cache does not yet contain a matching route, as a fallback the node hands the message to its successor in the virtual ring. The virtual successor may not be physically close to the node, but the bootstrapping process should have established a route to it. As this fallback step is repeated, the message travels along the ring, eventually reaching the destination or being timed out. Classification SSR has reactive as well as proactive components, making it a hybrid routing protocol. Virtual Ring Routing is conceptually similar, the biggest difference being the usage of source routing in SSR compared to building up per-node state (routing tables) in VRR. Advantages * Message-Efficient: Only local broadcasts, no global flooding. * Low memory requirement. Little and limited state per node. * DHT functionality can expedite lookups or be used to build a server-less infrastructure. Disadvantages * The routes found may be longer than necessary. * The source routes add to the header size of the messages. Thus, less space is left for the payload.

It has been the centre of city life since the 14th century and takes its name from John Mackintosh, a local philanthropist. Notable buildings on John Mackintosh Square include the Parliament Building and the City Hall. History Map of Gibraltar in 1627, by Luis Bravo de Acu√±a: 1- Puerta de Espa√±a (now Landport Gate) 2- Castillo (Moorish Castle) 3- Hospital de San Juan de Dios (the old St Bernard's Hospital) 4- Plaza Mayor (now John Mackintosh Square) 5- Iglesia parroquial de Santa Mar√≠a la Coronada y San Bernardo (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned) 6- Calle Real (now Main Street 7- Puerta de √Åfrica (now Southport Gates) 8- Muelle Viejo (Old Mole) Originally known during the Spanish period as Plaza Mayor () (according to Alonso Hern√°ndez del Portillo in his work titled Historia de la Muy Noble y M√°s Leal Ciudad de Gibraltar ‚àí) or Gran Plaza () and afterwards as the Alameda (Spanish for an avenue lined with poplars, not to be confused with the Alameda Gardens), it opened out from the west of the Calle Real (now Main Street). Two buildings separated it from the Line Wall (Gibraltar's main sea wall during the Spanish period, which run from Landport to the foot of the South Mole): a large rectangular building to the west of the Square, and a smaller lower building to the south of it, the hospital and chapel of La Santa Misericordia (). During the first century of the British period, the square was used for military parades by the garrison and therefore known as the Parade or Grand Parade.(Bond, 47) In 1704, after the city's capture by an Anglo-Dutch fleet, the British converted the hospital and chapel of La Santa Misericordia into a debtors' prison. In 1753, a survey of Gibraltar went on showing a prison at the western end of the square. After the Great Siege, a colonnaded Georgian guardhouse was built on the southern side of the square. It was the Main Guard, the place from which all the sentries in Gibraltar were posted each evening. Some years later it hosted the Fire Brigade.(Benady, 17) After the move of the brigade to the new fire station at Victoria Battery in 1938, it became the Rates Office. Today the guardhouse houses the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. The square was also where military punishment in the form of floggings took place. The look of the square changed very much during the second decade of the 19th century, when its two most prominent buildings were constructed. In 1817 local merchants raised money by public subscription to construct a building to house the Exchange and Commercial Library. In 1807, Gibraltar merchants had founded a library in Bedlam Court, as they were denied membership of the Garrison Library,(Benady, 13) it being available only to members of the British garrison in the city (the Garrison Library functioned not only as a library, but as a club, owned and run by and for military officers; civilians were excluded, regardless of their prominence). Ten years later, in 1817, they built themselves a new building on the east side of the square, thus separating it from Main Street. It housed, not only a library, but also an auction room and became the meeting place of local merchants. In 1951, the building was refurbished to host the Legislative Council, which in 1969 become the House of Assembly. Since 2006, the building hosts the Gibraltar Parliament. View of the City Hall from John Mackintosh Square About the same time, in 1819, on the opposite side of the square, Aaron Cardozo, a prosperous merchant of Jewish Portuguese descent, built the grandest private mansion ever seen in Gibraltar. The three-storey house dominated the square. It was erected on the site of the old hospital and chapel of La Santa Misericordia and later prison. As a non Protestant, Cardozo was not legally allowed to own property in Gibraltar. However, as he had been a close friend of Horatio Nelson and had supplied his fleet, he was eventually granted a site to build a house in the Alameda on the condition that it be \\"an ornament\\" to the square. Its cost was about ¬£40,000.(Bond, 49) After his death in 1834, his mansion was rented out as a hotel, the Club House Hotel. It was bought in 1874 by Pablo Antonio Larios, a wealthy businessman and banker, Gibraltarian-born and member of a Spanish family, who completely refurbished the building. In 1922, his son Pablo Larios, Marquis of Marzales, sold the building to the Gibraltar colonial authorities, which intended to turn it into a post office. However, it eventually became the premises of the newly formed Gibraltar City Hall which now houses the Mayor's Parlour.(Benady, 19) The building later underwent multiple modifications (such as the addition of a new storey and an extension to the north) that altered the original symmetry of the building. In the mid 19th century the name of the square was changed to Commercial Square, being the site of a daily flea market and regular public auctions, as a result of which a Spanish name, Plazuela del Martillo, or more colloquially, El Martillo, was coined (\\"martillo\\" being the Spanish word for a gavel). Another popular name at the time was Jews Market. These epithets fell out of usage and the square is typically referred to as The Piazza, an Italian name created following the construction of a paved area in the centre of the square, probably introduced by Gibraltar's Genoese settlers. The name \\"John Mackintosh Square\\" was officially adopted in 1940. Fountains In 1571, an aqueduct was built to channel drinking water from the Red Sands in the south district to the city. A fountain at the northwest corner of the square (the steps now called Fountain Ramp, known in Spanish as Callej√≥n de la Fuente, to the north of where the City Hall is today) was supplied by this aqueduct. Although the aqueduct fell into disuse some years later, with the fountain drying up, the fountain head was refurbished in 1694. It was moved to Castle Street in 1887 and remained there until the 1960s.(Benady, 18) It was eventually re-erected on the Line Wall against Zoca Flank some to the northwest of its original location (Mather, 246) (four lion-headed vents were carved in the low part of the fountain, representing war, pestilence, death and peace). In 1869, a new fountain was erected by the Sanitary Commission, fed from wells in the isthmus that links The Rock with Spain to supply drinking water. It was inaugurated on 8 December by Lady Airey, wife of Governor Sir Richard Airey.(Mather, 248) However, the \\"Airey Fountain\\" became dry very soon and was replaced in 1879 by an ornamental fountain constructed to commemorate the stay of The 1st Duke of Connaught and Strathearn ‚Äî third son of Queen Victoria ‚Äî in Gibraltar.(Mather, 249) It was dismantled during the Second World War.(Bond, 48) The construction of an air-raid shelter beneath John Mackintosh Square (then known as Commercial Square) in 1939 (looking west). Air-raid shelter The construction of an air-raid shelter beneath John Mackintosh Square (then known as Commercial Square) in 1939 (looking east). In 1939 excavations were carried out for the construction of an air-raid shelter under John Mackintosh Square. These excavations revealed no prior building foundations, suggesting the Square has been an open plaza for its entire 600+ year history. Today, part of the underground shelter houses the square's public toilets. Events=Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II After the breakout of World War II a decision was made to enforce a mass evacuation from Gibraltar in order to increase the strength of The Rock as a fortress with increased military and naval personnel. This meant that only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay. In early June 1940, about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco. However, following the capitulation of the French to the German armies in June 1940 and the destruction of the French fleet at Mers el-Kebir by the British fleet, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government asked for all Gibraltarians to be removed.(Bond, 97) An opportunity for their removal soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived at Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating French servicemen rescued from Dunkirk. Once they had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take on all the evacuees. Although Crichton could not clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), he eventually agreed to do so. However, when the evacuees arrived in Gibraltar, the Governor, Sir Clive Liddel, did not allow them to land, fearing that once the evacuees were back on The Rock, it would be virtually impossible to re-evacuate them.(Bond, 98) Crowds gathered at John Mackintosh Square as the news of the orders not to land broke, speeches were made and two City Councilors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor Liddell to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived, and by 13 July the re-evacuation had been completed. Intervention of Joshua Hassan and Peter Isola before the United Nations In September 1963, Chief Minister Joshua Hassan, and Leader of the Opposition Peter Isola, travelled to New York City to intervene before the United Nations Decolonisation Committee as \\"petitioners\\" from Gibraltar. Crowds filled John Mackintosh Square as they gathered to wish them well and then again to welcome them back. Their homecoming took place on 24 September 1963 and was commemorated in the painting The Triumphal Welcome depicting the scene at John Mackintosh Square, authored by local artist Ambrose Avellano.'The Triumphal Welcome' , 3 September 2008, Panorama Gibraltar National Day symbolic release of 30,000 red and white balloons from the roof of the Parliament Building, National Day 2009. In 1992, John Mackintosh Square was the venue chosen by the then Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Joe Bossano, to celebrate the first Gibraltar National Day. This National Day is celebrated annually on 10 September to commemorate Gibraltar's first sovereignty referendum of 1967, in which Gibraltarian voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under Spanish sovereignty, or remain under British sovereignty, with institutions of self-government, overwhelmingly opting to remain British. However, the first National Day was so successful that the avalanche of people that turned up could not fit into John Mackintosh Square. Therefore, in 1993 the venue was changed to the larger Grand Casemates Square. This remained the main venue almost continuously until 2008 when the official celebrations were returned to John Mackintosh Square, with the Mayor conducting the main event and presenting the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour from the balcony of the City Hall.

In 2005 Blau joined the daily Haaretz and published a articles exposing alleged corruption by Ehud Olmert, then leader of Kadima Party, candidate for Prime Minister and later Prime Minister. This expos√© has led to a criminal investigation and to Olmert's indictment. Another investigation that led to a major police investigation was about Avigdor Liberman, head of Israel Beitenu party. Blau revealed that a company owned by Liberman's daughter, who was in her early twenties, received unexplained payment in the millions of dollars Other investigations focused on former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Former IDF Chief Moshe Yaalon, the Kabbalah Laam organization and more, such as an article about exploring his roots in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Israeli connections to a mine in Kosovo. IN 2014 Blau completed a fellowship at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. He has published articles and investigations in various publications, including AP, ProPublica, Washington Post, Quartz, The Nation, Mashable, Times of Israel and more http://www.uriblau.com/about-me. Blau is a member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ. He is a member of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize winning team for the Panama Papers project, and contributed to other global investigations such as the FinCEN Files. As part of that investigation he co-produced the BBC documentary \\"The Settlers‚Äô Billionaire Backer\\" https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000n75c about the role of Roman Abramovich owned companies in supporting settler group Ir David Foundation. Anat Kamm affair=Background In November 2008, Blau published a story in Haaretz saying that the targeted killing of one of two Islamic Jihad militants killed in Jenin in June 2007 had violated a prior ruling of the Supreme Court of Israel. The ruling had \\"heavily restricted the circumstances in which they were permissible, effectively saying that killing should not take place if arrest was possible.\\" The report reproduced two IDF memos classified as top secret, indicating that the IDF had ignored the Supreme Court ruling. Publications dealing with military affairs have to be submitted to the Israeli Military Censor; the censor approved the publication of this report. This fact would later be used as argument that no damage was done by the publication. Speculation began immediately about who Blau's inside source was. It took a year before attention focused on Anat Kamm, a former clerk in the office of a senior IDF commander. She had worked as a journalist before and after her military service. A week before Operation Cast Lead began (December 2008), Blau submitted to the censor an expos√© revealing he had possession of IDF military plans for the Operation. At first, the report was approved for publication. Then, just before it was distributed the censor changed its mind and Haaretz agreed to withdraw the story. Arrest of Anat Kamm In the year, leading up to Kamm's arrest, Blau also published another article regarding Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Gaby Ashkenazi. The reporter claimed that Barak, on becoming minister, had transferred his private consulting company to his three daughters, violating the regulation allowing such a transfer only if the daughters were actually employed by the company. Furthermore, the company which he gave to his daughters took in nearly $2-million from unknown sources after he entered the government. Blau also claimed that after leaving the army and joining the private sector, Ashkenazi approached Barak about entering into business with him. In September 2009, the Shin Bet negotiated a written agreement with Blau to hand over 50 classified documents and destroy his work computer. In return the IDF agreed not to pursue or prosecute his source. In December 2009, the Shin Bet secretly arrested Anat Kamm and began interrogating her. Eventually, she was accused of leaking as many as 2,000 documents to the reporter. Blau and Haaretz viewed the soldier's arrest as a violation of their agreement. Blau, who had left Israel on an Asian backpacking trip that same month of Kamm's arrest, decided to remain abroad pending resolution of the case and eventually ended up in London. The Shin Bet publicly announced that they want to question and perhaps prosecute him. He claimed journalistic privilege and refused to return until he has guarantees about the outcome of his case. On October 24, 2010 Uri Blau returned to Israel. Israelis have exhibited mixed feelings about Blau. Some view him as little better than a traitor out to harm the national security. Others support his work. A group of 12 senior Israeli journalists petitioned the government not to prosecute Blau if he returns from London and gives back any outstanding documents he may still possess. After Blau became the first journalist in Israel convicted for possession of classified information, Freedom House dropped Israel to ‚ÄòPartially Free‚Äô status in its 2013 ‚ÄúFreedom of the Press Index‚Äù. Indictment of Blau In March 2011 the Israeli Ministry of Justice announced its intention to put Blau on trial, subject to the hearing, charged with maintaining classified items without authorization. In May 2012 it was announced that he will be indicted for \\"possession of classified IDF documents.\\" In July 2012, Blau accepted a plea bargain that would see him sentenced to four months' community service but avoid serving any time in prison. He completed four months community service in January 2013, publishing an article about the experience in Haaretz newspaper in August 2013. Civil Lawsuit In April 2013 Kamm sued Haaretz, its publisher and Blau for allegedly operating in a negligence way that eventually led to her exposure as Blau's source https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-anat-kamm-suing-haaretz-for-revealing-her-as- papers-source-1.5236910.

Haaretz and Blau appealed to Israel's Supreme Court against that verdict. Their appeal was accepted. In January 2020 Supreme Court dismissed the District Court verdict in its entirety. As a gesture of good will Haaretz has agreed to participate in paying part of Kamm's legal fees, at the amount of $100,000 https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-settlement-of-suit-between- haaretz-and-anat-kamm-1.8399103.

The 10th Regiment saw action in the coastal campaign during the early years of the war, which culminated with the siege of Charleston. The 10th went on to fight the trench battles of Richmond, earning praise from Union generals and Ulysses S. Grant. The 10th was active at the war‚Äôs very end, when they blocked Robert E. Lee‚Äôs attempt to escape from Virginia. And, the 10th was present at Appomattox Court House when Lee surrendered to Grant. All told, the 10th regiment fought in twenty three battles and at least as many skirmishes. Formation of the Regiment The 10th Connecticut Infantry Regiment was originally formed from the 10th Connecticut Volunteers. After the Union loss at the first Battle of Bull Run, in the summer of 1861, volunteers poured into the Union army ranks. In September, members of the 10th regiment started arriving at Camp Buckingham in Hartford. Members of the 10th regiment came from Connecticut towns large and small, including, Hartford, New Haven, Derby, Manchester, Sprague, New London, Stamford and Greenwich. After a few months at Camp Buckingham, the 10th regiment headed down to Annapolis, M.D. for additional training before joining General Burnside‚Äôs North Carolina Expedition to blockade vital Confederate ports. Combat record=Battle of Roanoke Island (February 1862) Map of Roanoke Island, showing forts and fleet dispositions, February 7, 1862, on the left, and on the right, the battlefield where opposing armies met on February 8. Prepared by Lt. Andrews, 9th N.Y. Regiment. One of the first objectives for Burnside‚Äôs expeditionary force was to capture Roanoke Island in North Carolina. After a harrowing sea voyage through a violent storm, during which hundreds of Connecticut soldiers perished due to illness, the Tenth was put ashore on the North Carolina coast. The two-day battle for Roanoke Island started with Union gunboats bombarding the Confederate positions. The Tenth faced a daunting task trying to dislodge the 3,000 enemy defenders. Captain Pardee of the Tenth wrote, \\"They had three pieces of artillery fronting and commanding this clearing; and large numbers of riflemen perched in trees, behind the turfed walls and under all possible covers.\\" The Tenth along with the other Connecticut units made a determined advance and completely routed the Confederates. After the victory, the Tenth was recognized for their bravery and excellent soldierly actions by commanding General John G. Foster. The Tenth also won praise from their comrades in the 8th Connecticut Volunteers, being written about as \\"the gallant Connecticut Tenth\\". The Tenth sustained the heaviest losses in the Battle of Roanoke Island in North Carolina by any regiment engaged, with 56 soldiers killed or wounded. Battle of Newbern (March 1862) Battle of New Bern as illustrated in Harper's Weekly. 5 April 1862 After taking Roanoke Island, the next Union objective was to move up the Neuse River and attack a Confederate position at Newbern, North Carolina, a strategic coastal town, west of the Outer Banks. On the morning of March 13, General Burnside ordered the entire brigade to advance on the Confederate position. The Confederates had established a long line of impressive defensive fortifications manned by 7,000 soldiers and a large number of heavy artillery. Here, a heavy and sustained rifle fire from the Tenth Connecticut weakened parts of the Confederate line. This allowed the 8th Connecticut and 4th Rhode Island troops to charge and begin the rout of the enemy forces. Newbern was soon under Union control. In his report, General Foster praised the men of the Tenth, writing, \\"...(the Tenth) advanced..., in line of battle, fired with the most remarkable steadiness,..., giving and taking the most severe fire.\\" Action at Rawls Mills (November 1862) The Tenth remained in Newbern all throughout the summer of 1862. The next action for the Tenth came in November 1862, when the regiment was ordered to attack a rebel supply route near Rawls Mills, N.C. The Tenth was out in front of the Union troops, the first to take fire in leading the advance. Rebel troops were pushed back repeatedly as the Union troops marched through Williamston and continued on to capture Rainbow Fort on the Roanoke River. Two weeks later, the Tenth was back in Newbern having accomplished their mission. Battle at Kinston (December 1862) In December 1862, the Tenth moved out of Newbern to support General McClellan‚Äôs attack on the Confederate capital of Richmond and to cut off the Wilmington Railroad. The first encounter with the Confederate forces was near the Kinston Bridge over the Neuse River. The advance of the first two lines of Union troops was halted by the Confederate resistance and swamp terrain. Here, General Foster called on the Tenth to make a breakthrough. The Tenth pressed the attack through a hailstorm of bullets. They charged the Confederate positions, and, after half an hour of murderous, close-range, rifle-exchanges, the Tenth gained the upper hand. The Confederate lines collapsed. As they retreated, the Confederate troops set fire to the strategic Kinston bridge. Undeterred, the Tenth managed to douse the flames, capture the bridge and drive off the enemy forces. In this battle, the Tenth captured 100 Confederate soldiers and all of the Confederate artillery. This had been the most difficult fighting that the Tenth had experienced, thus far. The losses were large, both in officers and enlisted ranks. Of the three hundred and sixty officers and men sent into action, over a third were killed in action or died within four days of the battle. General Foster again hailed the Tenth as the \\"bravest among the brave\\". Battle of Goldsboro Bridge (December 1862) The Tenth was given no time to rest. The regiment moved on toward the town of Goldsboro, North Carolina Again the Tenth was at the front of the Union force. At Goldsboro the regiment destroyed Confederate railroad tracks and a burned a railroad bridge. With the mission accomplished, the Tenth returned to Newbern, having absorbed one fourth of all Union losses in this expedition. Assault on Fort Wagner (July 1863) Plan of Fort Wagner, with overlay showing armament During 1862, despite the Union Army advances along the Carolina coast, the Confederacy had largely succeeded in defending its territory, beating back the stronger Union forces with superior battlefield leadership. At the beginning of 1863, the Union Army was still in search of a major, morale-boosting victory. The Tenth finally moved out of Newbern, North Carolina, in January 1863. The regiment was ordered to St. Helena Island, South Carolina, near Charleston. The Union blockade of Charleston harbor was effective, but the city remained in Confederate hands. In early July, the Tenth was ordered to join a large-scale assault on Fort Wagner, situated on nearby Morris Island.This was part of the second Union attempt to capture Charleston. The Tenth‚Äôs main role in the assault was a successful diversionary action. The main attack force consisted of the African American troops of the 54th Massachusetts and the 6th Connecticut (as depicted in the motion picture Glory). The attack on Fort Wagner did not initially succeed, although Union forces did breach the fort‚Äôs defenses. After the attack, Union soldiers spent months digging trenches parallel to the Confederate lines. This tactic eventually proved a successful strategy as the Confederate troops abandoned Fort Wagner in early September. Down the Atlantic coast to St. Augustine, Florida In late October 1863, the Tenth was ordered down the Atlantic coast for rest and recuperation in St. Augustine, Florida. The men of the Tenth were able to regain their strength at St. Augustine, but the enemy was always nearby. In fact, twenty two soldiers of the regiment were captured and one soldier was killed during a Confederate ambush. The men of the 10th were escorting a wood chopping detail near the base when the Confederates attacked. On the James River, City Point and Bermuda Hundred (May 1864) As 1864 began, the Union Armies of the Potomac and the James were methodically pushing General Lee‚Äôs Army to the strong defenses of the Confederate capital of Richmond. During February 1864, Connecticut veterans of the war were given furloughs. Veterans of the Tenth arrived in New Haven on February 19 and then travelled to Hartford. They were warmly received and praised by town and state leaders. Veterans of the Tenth re-enlisted for another three years and new recruits joined the regiment. In May 1864, men of the Tenth Connecticut were back on the front line. The regiment was assigned to the Tenth Corps in the Army of the James. Their first mission was to take the strategic riverfronts at City Point and Bermuda Hundred in Virginia. The 10th regiment and accompanying Union troops accomplished this mission by moving quickly up the James River, surprising the Confederate forces, and landing unopposed. City Point, situated on the confluence of the James and Appomattox Rivers, would later become General Grant‚Äôs main headquarters and the Union‚Äôs staging area for the siege of Petersburg and Richmond. Battle of Fort Darling (Drewry‚Äôs Bluff) (May 1864) Confederate gun at Battery Dantzler, Drewry's Bluff. The next objective of the Union force was a march toward Richmond to encircle the Confederate capital. In their path stood Fort Darling, a strong defensive position on the James River, near Drewry‚Äôs Bluff and just south of Richmond. The assault on Fort Darling did not succeed. However, the Tenth fought bravely, mainly in rearguard action, protecting other Union regiments. Despite this setback, Union troops continued on toward Richmond. Repelling an attack on the march to Richmond In early October, the advancing Union army was suddenly counterattacked by Confederate cavalry and infantry units. The Tenth fended off the attack despite fighting with an exposed flank, as an adjacent New York regiment turned and ran when the Confederates charged. General H.M. Plaisted, commander of the Tenth Army Corps, wrote of the Tenth Connecticut, \\"In my opinion, the conduct of the Tenth Regiment, when the troops on its right broke and fled, saved the Army of the James.\\" Battle for Fort Gregg (April 1865) By early April 1865, Union forces were at the outer defenses of Petersburg. The Tenth was now poised to attack Fort Gregg, an intimidating defensive position, consisting of well constructed trenches and earthworks, backed up by many artillery pieces. On April 2 the Tenth, supported by the 100th New York Infantry, advanced toward Fort Gregg, facing murderous cannon and rifle fire. Many of the Tenth fell far short of their objective. But, the main body of the regiment reached the fort, and there began fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Connecticut flag was first to be placed on the parapet of the fort, and after the brutal struggle, the Tenth Connecticut emerged victorious. Victory came at a high cost; half of the Tenth‚Äôs assault force were either killed or wounded. After the battle, Major General John Gibbon, presented to the Tenth Connecticut, an ornate bronze eagle, resting on a globe to place atop the Connecticut state flag. This distinction went to the men of the Tenth for \\"...for gallant conduct in the assault on Fort Gregg...\\". Appomattox Court House (April 1865) Federal soldiers at the courthouse, April 1865 The men of the Tenth were pressed into action once again in pursuit of the retreating Robert E. Lee. Lee withdrew from Richmond to Danville, Virginia and looked to link up with General Johnston‚Äôs army in North Carolina. At dawn, on April 9, Lee tried to break through Union lines near Appomattox Station, 100 miles west of Richmond. After an initial surge forward by the Confederate troops, the Tenth and First Connecticut Cavalry blocked Lee‚Äôs escape. The war lost, Lee signed the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, just hours later, at Appomattox Court House. The 10th Connecticut was present. Record and legacy The Tenth Connecticut was mustered out of the Union Army on August 25, 1865. During the four-year war, the Tenth Connecticut saw service from 2,124 men.

Marajo Island Praia de S√£o Jo√£o - Maraj√≥ Island In 1991, Roosevelt published, Moundbuilders of the Amazon: Geophysical Archaeology on Marajo Island, Brazil, which detailed her work throughout the 1980s on pre- Columbian Marajoara culture.Book Review: Moundbuilders of the Amazon, The Society for Archaeological Sciences Bulletin. James I. Ebert (9/98). Her research team employed remote sensing geophysical surveys, together with excavation. The Marajo Island lies near the mouth of the Amazon River and contains evidence of pre-Columbian settlement. In this work, Roosevelt challenged the theory that the pre-Columbian Amazon was a \\"counterfeit paradise\\" unable to sustain increasingly complex human culture. Roosevelt posited that this pre-Columbian society was \\"one of the outstanding indigenous cultural achievements,\\" with a high population and territory, intensive subsistence agriculture, as well as public works.Mann, 1491. p. 335. These findings and arguments have led to continuing debates in South American archaeology and anthropology.Earthmovers of the Amazon, Science.Charles C. Mann. Vol. 287:786-789. 4 February 2000.

March 1997: Vol. 275, no. 5308, pp. 1948‚Äì1952. Roosevelt's investigation found evidence for human habitation in the Amazon much older than previously known, perhaps twice as old. Over a 1000-year period, about 10,000-11,000 years ago, humans used the cave and left behind unique projectile points, as well as evidence that they had transported plant seeds from far away to the site. They lived in a different way from the cultures of the earliest-known, Western Hemisphere big-game-hunters, relying instead on the rivers and forest.Mann, 1491. p. 338. Also suggesting a later human reoccupation at the site and along the nearby riverbank was evidence of 7,500-year-old pottery, which would make it the oldest, or among the oldest pottery found in the Americas. Roosevelt's findings suggested that the study of migration of humans into the Americas, as well as the development of civilization in the Amazon, needed to be revisited.'Discoveries in Clovis Cave Suggest Clovis Wasn't First\\", and \\"Anna Roosevelt Makes Headlines\\" Mammoth Trumpet.

It now serves as the administrative center and library for the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description and history The Katharine Seymour Day House is located in the Nook Farm area Hartford's Asylum Hill neighborhood, at the southwest corner of Farmington Avenue and Forest Street. It is just east of the Mark Twain House, and north of the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. The house is a 2-1/2 story stone structure, built out of a multicolored combination of brownstone and limestone. It is a fine local example of Queen Anne Victorian architecture, with a busy exterior in terms of color and organization, with projecting gables, dormers and porches. The interior features high quality woodwork, plasterwork and tile. Day House The house was designed by Francis H. Kimball, and was built for Franklin Chamberlin and completed the project in 1884.Sterner, Daniel. A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2012: 152. He is believed to have built the house as a rival to the adjacent Mark Twain House. Chamberlin had previously sold the adjacent land to Mark Twain on which his house was built. The house was later owned by Willie Olcott Burr, publisher of The Hartford Times newspaper. It was purchased by Harriet Beecher Stowe's grandniece Katharine Seymour Day in 1940, as part of a plan to preserve the surroundings of the Stowe House (which was also originally built for Chamberlin). Day established the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in 1941 as a nonprofit vehicle to preserve Stowe's legacy. The house now houses the center's administrative offices, and a research library containing many of Stowe's materials.

Career=Youth Bates was born at Frimley, Surrey, and was educated at Lord Wandsworth College, Hook, Hampshire. He joined Hampshire's under-10 academy team, and progressed through their youth ranks. Bates represented the England U-19 cricket team, playing one Youth Test match and ten Youth One Day Internationals. Bates played for England in the 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup.

Bates was an integral part Hampshire's team that won the 2010 Friends Provident T20. Veteran keeper Nic Pothas' injury meant that Bates played a lot of matches in 2011, and whilst his batting was rarely needed his tidy work behind the stumps and especially the pressure he created standing up to the likes of Dominic Cork and Chris Wood was vital to winning. For the 2013 season, Hampshire signed wicket keeper/batsman Adam Wheater from Essex, which limited Bates to mainly T20 and second II cricket for the following two seasons. As a result, he was released at the end of the 2014 season on expiry of his contract.http://www.alloutcricket.com/cricket/features/michael-bates- the-dichotomy-of-a-gloveman#w8fzW1IoGsQ5Yj3h.99 Somerset: 2015 After trials at Essex,http://www.express.co.uk/sport/cricket/564272/Cricket- Hampshire-Michael-Bates-Essex-Trials he signed for Minor Counties team Wiltshire.

Zwing and Twing are different spellings based on the local Swiss German dialect. The magistrate or Zwing(Twing)herr had legally binding rules and regulations in the exercise of low justice in his private jurisdiction. The Twingrecht, the right to judge and punish, was handed down orally until the late Middle Ages. A county court (or Twing/Zwing) included one or usually several villages. Origin The original term came from the Latin Districtus et bannus though Middle High German (' meaning force or violence and ban meaning command or prohibition). History Starting in the 13th century Zwing und Bann appears in contracts of sale and indicated that the land holder had \\"all powers other than death\\". There is no further clarification, though it appears that robbery and other serious crimes were intended to be handled by the higher courts. From this it would appear that the right included full sovereignty to the exclusion of the death sentence. But starting in the 15th Century, some legal battles show that the situation was not so clear at the mutual boundary between high and low justice. An additional source of conflict came about since the concept of Zwing und Bann could vary depending on the territories. In general, the Zwing/Twing is synonymous with the manor's village or an independent village. The Zwingherrschaft including the office of judge and the right to impose fines, pasture authority and a duty to protect individuals, and was therefore similar to a bailiff, though acting on a smaller level. The Lord took care of minor crimes and misdemeanors, civil matters involving property, inheritance and money debts. He was also the master of common land and water, he could make them available to farmers or to otherwise deny them access (\\"bann\\"). He reserved the right to fish, or could grant that right to individuals or the community. He could grant concessions or licenses to operate community buildings such as inns, mills, presses and forges (or, in the locations of some importance, to bakeries, butcher shops, tanneries and dye works) and compel his subjects to use them. When multiple owners shared the ban and a city court, the profit was proportional to the share of each. Starting in the Late Middle Ages Zwing und Bann, which had been handed down orally, was codified. This was a reaction to abuses of power by the overlords against the local leaders or peasant communities. According to the local Customs, the Twinggericht court had jurisdiction over cases of assault without too serious injuries (fractures, bleeding and bloodless wounds by stabbing, throwing, scratching and hitting, knife possession and burglary), breach of domestic peace, violations of honor and morality, border disputes, pastoral or forestry crimes (crop damage and trespassing) and could seize property. For medium- serious offenses, a distinction is based precisely on seriousness of the crime, for example \\"breaking the word of the oath peaceably\\" would go to the lower court, while \\"breaking the oath of peace by armed force\\" was within the jurisdiction of the high court. The court was usually composed of twelve lay people, was chaired by a representative of the lord (the Amtmann i.e. bailiff). The maximum penalty was three schillings for offenses against crops, up to three pounds for more serious offenses (injury or defamation) and even higher for repeat offenders.

Built about 1890, it is typical of houses that were once much more common the city's Asylum Hill neighborhood. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 29, 1979. Description and history 142 Collins Street is located in Hartford's Asylum Hill area, on the north side of Collins Street east of its junction with Summer Street, opposite the main complex of The Hartford Insurance Group. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a truncated hip roof and numerous projecting gables and dormers. The front facade has porches on the first and second levels, the upper one occupying only the central bay; both have decorative spindled woodwork friezes and turned supports. A projecting gable section to the right is finished with scalloped shingles, and has a two-window angled bay. The house was built in 1890, and is, with the neighboring house (built about 1870 in the Second Empire style, a study in architectural trends that took place during the development of Asylum Hill in the second half of the 19th century.

It is managed by the Fishlake National Forest and the Richfield District of the Bureau of Land Management. The Paiute Trail has over 2000 miles of primary and designated side trails. The main loop of the trail is approximately 240 miles long and covers four counties, Piute County, Beaver County, Sevier County, and Millard County in Utah. The Paiute Trail has trail heads in Marysvale, Circleville, Junction, Koosharem, Antimony, Angle, Monroe, Richfield, Joseph, Aurora, Salina, Annabella, Elsinore, Fillmore, and Kanosh. Most of these communities allow riding on the streets; the State of Utah now allows street-legal vehicles to run on the highway. The Paiute Trail also has trail heads at the Fremont Indian State Park and Museum. The Paiute ATV Trail Committee, a non-profit organization consisting of government, city, Sheriff, business owners and local citizens, aids in fund raising and management of the trail system. Exploring the Paiute ATV Trail The Paiute Trail system was formed by connecting old roads and trails crossing the Fishlake National Forest with intervening BLM-administered land. Sections of trail were constructed to complete the interconnecting #01 loop. The main #01 trail is 238 miles long, with over 2000 miles of marked side trails and forest roads that are open to ATVs and other recreational vehicles. Much of the Paiute Trail is open to SidexSide Vehicles greater than 50\\", but there are several two-track trails that are restricted to 50\\". Riders may see mule deer, elk, bear, mountain goats, cougars, coyotes, sage grouse, pine hen, pheasants, rabbits, rattlesnakes, wild turkeys, badgers, beavers, hawks, eagles, owls, porcupines, and bobcats. The main loop of the #01 trail is estimated to take approximately 25 riding hours to complete. However, riders could spend weeks traversing the side forest roads and trails. Riding Season Many parts of the Paiute Trail are closed seasonally. Riding typically starts in April in the lowlands with some the highest riding closed until mid-July. While spring riding is possible on the lower portions of the trail, snowdrifts usually close the trail over the Tushar Mountains, the Pavant Range and the Sevier Plateau until early July. This part of the trail remains closed until mid-to- late July. September and October provide some of the best riding weather on the Paiute Trail. At this time of year the days are brisk, the nights cool, the trees colorful, and the chance of precipitation is low. August is also a good time for the high country, although the lower portions of the trail can be hot. After October, storms may close the upper portions of the trail. Weather Because of the size of the trail system and the varied geography and altitude, weather can be very extreme, and fluctuate greatly even over the course of hours. Temperatures in excess of 100F in the valley floors can be encountered, while snow covers the trails at higher elevations. Rain storms can come in quickly, and because the mountain ranges can present limited visibility, without much notice. Riders should bring clothing for all types of weather that they may encounter. Fuel availability Gasoline is available in most of the populated areas along the trail system. Some of the smaller localities may have limited selection. Notably, Koosharem has only 83 octane gasoline available. While gasoline is generally available, some sections of the trail may exceed the fuel capacity of a vehicle, so spare fuel should be carried as a standard measure. As many portions of the trail climbing out of valley floors rapidly gain 6,000 feet or more of elevation, fuel consumption can be higher than expected. Events The Paiute ATV Trail is home to three ATV and SideXSide Jamborees. The Fillmore National ATV Jamboree, held each June with 14 choices of trail rides for 500 rider The National ATV Jamboree Rocky Mountain ATV Jamboree, held each September with over 70 guided trail rides and 650 riders. The Rocky Mountain ATV Jamboree The Paiute Trail UTV Jamboree held the second week of August has approximately 20 guided rides and approximately 600 riders. Map Sources There are multiple sources for maps of the Paiute Trail: * The Marysvale.org web site has a rough map of the trail system on its web page. * National Geopgraphic Map 708. * The Paiute Trail committee publishes a 60+ page map book. * Avenza maps has a digital map. * Official National Forest Service maps are available free of charge. Altitude Considerations While the valley floors can be as low as 4,000 feet, much of the trail system is at 10,000 feet or above. This has the potential to cause altitude sickness in persons not accustomed to the conditions. Motor vehicles lose power output at higher altitudes, and vehicles prone to vapor lock will be much more affected at higher altitudes.

BUilt in 1861, it is a prominent example of high-style Gothic Revival residential architecture, and is notable for the association of its first owner, Charles Perkins, with author Samuel Clemens. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 14, 1978, and is a contributing property to the Nook Farm and Woodland Street District. Description and history The Perkins-Clark House is located in a residential area of western Hartford, on the west side of Woodland Street near its junction with Niles Street. It is set on a large parcel overlooking the Park River to the west. It is a -story stuccoed structure, with a steeply pitched roof that has gables decorated with bargeboard, and multiple bands of chimneys with corbelled brick tops. The house was designed by Octavius and Augustus Jordan, according to principles put forth by Calvert Vaux and Andrew Jackson Downing for the construction of Gothic villas. It was built in 1861 for Charles Perkins, a lawyer whose clients included Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain), whose house stands on Farmington Avenue to the south. This stylish Gothic Revival house is the last residential building on Woodland Street, which was once lined with fashionable properties. In 1924 it was purchased by Judge Walter Clark, who undertook numerous alterations, although he was careful to match new buildings stylistically to the main house. The house now houses professional offices.

The official name for the camp is Kwan-li-so (Penal-labor colony) No. 14. The camp is commonly known as Camp 14. It is not to be confused with the Kaechon concentration camp (Kyo-hwa-so No. 1), which is located to the northwest. Description The camp was established around 1959 in central North Korea near Kae'ch≈èn county, South Pyongan Province. It is situated along the middle reaches of the Taedong river, which forms the southern boundary of the camp, and includes the mountains north of the river, including Purok-san. Bukchang, a concentration camp (Kwan-li-so No.18) adjoins the southern banks of the Taedong River. The camp is about in area, with farms, mines and factories threaded through the steep mountain valleys.North Korean Human Rights: Prison Camps in 2012..., ned.org; accessed October 30, 2014. The camp includes overcrowded barracks that house males, females, and older children separately, a headquarters with administrative buildings and guard housing. Altogether around 15,000 are imprisoned in Kaechon internment camp. Purpose The main purpose of the Kaechon internment camp is to keep politically unreliable persons classed \\"unredeemable\\" isolated from society and to exploit their labour. Those sent to the camp include officials perceived to have performed poorly in their job, people who criticize the regime, their children, anyone who was born in the camp, and anyone suspected of engaging in \\"anti-government\\" activities. Prisoners have to work in one of the coal mines, in agriculture, or in one of the factories that produce textiles, paper, food, rubber, shoes, ceramics, and cement. Livestock raising is considered the occupation of choice for the prisoners as it gives them the chance to steal animal food and pick through animal droppings for undigested grains. Human rights situation Witnesses have reported that prisoners interred in the camp are required to work for long periods, often from 5:30 to midnight. Even 11-year-old children have to work after school and thus rarely see their parents. Other reports describe prisoners being beaten and severely punished for minor infractions. Food rations are scant, consisting of salted cabbage and corn. The prisoners are emaciated; they lose their teeth, and their gums blacken. Many die of malnourishment, illness, work accidents, and the after-effects of torture. Many prisoners resort to eating frogs, insects, rats, snakes, and even cannibalism in order to try to survive. Eating rat flesh helps prevent pellagra, a common disease in the camp resulting from the absence of protein and niacin in the diet. In order to eat anything outside of the prison-sanctioned meal, including these animals, prisoners must first get permission from the guards. Imprisoned witnessesShin Dong-hyuk= In his official biography Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden, Shin Dong-hyuk claimed that he was born in the camp and lived there until escaping in his early twenties. In 2015, Shin recounted some of this story. Shin told Harden that he had changed some dates and locations and incorporated some \\"fictive elements\\" into his account. Harden outlined these revisions in a new foreword but did not revise the entire book. Shin said that he did not spend his entire North Korean life at Camp 14. Though maintaining that he was born there, he stated that, when he was young, his family was transferred to the less severe Camp 18, and spent several years there. He said that he was tortured in Camp 14 in 2002, as punishment for escaping from Camp 18. =Kim Yong= Kim Yong (1995‚Äì1996 in Kaechon, then in Bukchang) was imprisoned after it was revealed that the two men who were executed as alleged US spies were his father and brother. He witnessed approximately 25 executions in his section of the camp within less than two years.

Dugdale arrived at Aston Villa as a director when they were in the third division, having been relegated due to poor performances on and off the pitch. He left the club in 1982, the year they won the European Cup. Following several successful years as a director in the early-1970s, he was elected chairman in 1975, taking over the position from Doug Ellis, the package holiday businessman, before being replaced by Harry Kartz. Biography Dugdale was born on 29 March 1922, the son of Sir William Francis Stratford Dugdale, 1st Bt of the Noble House of Stratford, and Margaret Gilmour. Educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, he succeeded to the title of 2nd Baronet Dugdale, of Merevale and Blyth, co. Warwick [UK, 1936] on 18 April 1965. He fought in the Second World War, where he was mentioned in despatches, gaining the rank of Captain in the service of the Grenadier Guards. He was decorated with the award of Military Cross (M.C.) in 1943 for outstanding bravery whilst under fire. He fought at Anzio, and ended the war guarding the German generals at Nuremberg. He was a practising solicitor in 1949. He held the office of Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for Warwickshire in 1951 and office of Deputy Lieutenant (D.L.) of Warwickshire in 1955. He held the office of High Sheriff of Warwickshire for 1971. He held the office of Sheriff of Stratford-upon-Avon in 1976.

He was chairman of General Utilities plc between 1988 and 1999 and was made head of the National Water Council in 1983, helping then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the powerful Unions in the water industry. His position and the fact he was a distant relation of IRA terrorist Rose Dugdale, made him a target for the IRA. He lived in 2003 at Merevale Hall, Atherstone, Warwickshire and at 24 Bryanston Mews West, London, England.

Retrieved 15 April 2010.hermandadrociosevilla.com, passim. Retrieved 14 April 2010. In recent years the Romer√≠a has brought together roughly a million pilgrims each year.Eva D√≠az P√©rez, \\"Los excesos del Roc√≠o\\", El Mundo, 27 May 2001. Retrieved 14 April 2010.El Roc√≠o , Rough Guide to Spain. Retrieved 14 April 2010. The pilgrimage dates from 1653, when the Virgin of Las Rocinas was appointed patron saint of Almonte. Originally it took place on 8 September. Since 1758, the Virgin has been known as the Virgin of El Roc√≠o, and the pilgrimage has taken place on the second day of Pentecost. Structure of the pilgrimage The romer√≠a as such begins on Sunday before Pentecost. However, pilgrims come from throughout Andalusia (and, nowadays, from throughout Spain and beyond), and typically travel an additional one to seven days beforehand, either on foot, on horseback or in horse-drawn carriages (or, nowadays, in some cases, modern modes of transport such as all terrain vehicles), generally sleeping outdoors. Many count this travel as the most important part of the pilgrimage. The pilgrims travel in groups known as religious confraternities. They come from many directions: the Camino de los Llanos (Plains Way) from Almonte proper; the Moguer Way, from Moguer and Huelva; the Sanl√∫car Way from C√°diz, crossing the River Guadalquivir at El Bajo de Gu√≠a; and the Seville Way. The pilgrimage proper begins at noon on the Saturday. From then until nearly midnight, each confraternity travels from their property in the village of El Rocio to the Sanctuary where they present their \\"Simpecado\\", their copy of the Virgin, the oldest confraternities proceeding first. Each bears an emblem of the Virgin del Rocio (Holy Mother). At midnight, it is the turn of the original confraternity to carry their emblem to the shrine. This is known as the Almonte Rosary ceremony. At 10 a.m. on Whitsun Sunday, a Pontifical High Mass is said in El Real del Roc√≠o (next to the Sanctuary), where the Virgin was crowned in 1919. On Sunday night, everyone prays the Rosary by candlelight, as each confraternity goes up to the flat of El Eucaliptal next to El Real del Roc√≠o. Finally, the Immaculate Conception Emblem of Almonte is brought to the Shrine, at which point the Almontese carry the Virgin of El Roc√≠o out into the village streets. The timing of this event differs from one year to the next, so there is always a certain element of spontaneity to it. Then the journey home begins. Attire The pilgrims travel through the countryside, sometimes by cart or on horseback, in celebration of regional agrarian customs. Both the horse and the costume reflect the historic privilege offered the rural gentry. Men wear a costume called traje corto consisting of striped pants (pantal√≥n a rayas), a short jacket (chaquetilla corta), suspenders (tirantes), leather chaps (zahones), a wide brimmed cordoba hat (sombrero de ala ancha), riding boots (botas de montar). Women wear a costume called traje de faralaes. Women's attire varies more but usually consists of a flowing dress (traje de vuelos) with polka dots and ruffles (volantes), a fringed shawl (mantoncillos de flecos) and bracelets, loop earrings and flowers worn in the hair. Origins and brotherhoods The first historical document that exists on the Roc√≠o is collected in the \\"Libro de la Monter√≠a\\", which King Alfonso XI ordered to be written. It lists only two places close to El Roc√≠o: the primitive Hermitage of Santa Mar√≠a de las Rocinas and the Villa de Mures, currently Villamanrique. The aforementioned book in his folio 292v says that: \\"La Xara de Mures, which is the Alxarafe, is a good mountain of pig in yuierno\\", and in the folio 294v states that: \\" En tierra de Niebla ay una tierra quel dizen las Rocinas et es llana, et es toda sotos, et ay siempre puercos‚Ä¶ et se√±alada mjente, son los meiores sotos de correr cabo vn yglesia que dizen Sancta Maria de las Ro-√ßinas et cabo de otra iglesia que dizen Sancta Olalla \\". At the dawn of the 15th century, a hunter from Villamanrique, who at the time was called Mures, named Gregorio Medina, was in La Rocina on his hunting day and was lucky to find, among the howls of the dogs, in the hollow of a thousand-year-old olive tree, the sacred image of the Virgen del Roc√≠o. \\"The first reference to a Marian place of worship in the area dates from the first half of the 14th century and is found in Alfonso XI's Libro de la monter√≠a, in which to a \\"chapel of Sancta Mar√≠a de las Rocinas.\\" In 1587 Baltasar Tercero Ruiz founded a chapel in the hermitage. The original brotherhood of Almonte is already documented in 1640, in a testament granted before the scribe of Villa Almonte√±a, D. Juan Bautista Serrano, on 1 January 1640, by Juan de Medina \\"el Viejo\\". In 1653 the patron saint of the town of Almonte was proclaimed and from these years the name of Virgen del Roc√≠o began to spread, to the detriment of the previous one of Santa Mar√≠a de las Rocinas. It is at this time that the first filial brotherhoods are founded, among which is that of Villamanrique de la Condesa and the brotherhood of Pilas. Between the second half of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, a series of brotherhoods emerged in towns near the village, such as La Palma del Condado, Moguer or Sanl√∫car de Barrameda -although recent research alludes to this brotherhood as the oldest- Subsequently, the Rota and El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a arose, disappearing soon after the latter two during the Napoleonic wars, to be re-founded later. Throughout the 19th century, four other brotherhoods emerged: Triana, Umbrete, Coria del R√≠o and Huelva. Between 1880 and 1913, a time of great convulsions in Andaluc√≠a, no new brotherhood emerged, but from that last date until the beginning of the 21st century, dozens of new filial brotherhoods have been created, adding up to the 110 sisterhoods that currently exist. Thus, in the decade of 1910 the brotherhoods of San Juan del Puerto (1913), Rociana del Condado (1919) and Benacaz√≥n (1915) emerged. Two epochs of special founding effervescence are also noteworthy in this long period, the second republic, with nine new brotherhoods in just three years and especially the period that began with the Democratic Transition, since more than half of the present brotherhoods, standing out the time of the Andalusian autonomic process, between 1977 and 1982, with fifteen brotherhoods filiales and the cuatrienio 1984-1987, with fourteen new brotherhoods. Of the 107 brotherhoods existing in 2008 (including the Matriz de Almonte), 96 are Andalusians and eleven outside of Andaluc√≠a. Among the sisterhoods outside of Andaluc√≠a should be distinguished between those founded in lands close to Andalusia, such as Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Ceuta and Murcia and those located in the traditional lands of Andalusian emigration, such as Catalonia, Valencia, Islas Baleares or Madrid . In the latter or the foundation was run by Andalusians or the bulk of the brothers is made up of Andalusians or descendants of these. It should also highlight the existence of the sisterhood of Brussels, the result of the rociera devotion of a group of Andalusians from the abundant community of this origin in Belgium. In 2018, the number of sisterhoods rose to 121, the last one being the Hermandad de El Viso del Alcor (Seville). Regarding the importance of the brotherhoods according to the number of pilgrims, the largest are the Huelva, with about 14,000 pilgrims in 2010 and the matrix of Almonte which is also located in the environment of 10,000 pilgrims. After these would be the sisterhood of Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, with about 5,500 pilgrims, the Brotherhood of Emigrants of Huelva (founded initially in Germany by Huelva emigrants) with about 5,000, the Pilas, with about 3,500 and Moguer with just over 2000 pilgrims Later, with an estimated amount of pilgrims between 1,000 and 3,000, Trigueros, Triana, Villamanrique de la Condesa, Coria del R√≠o, Seville, Jerez de la Frontera, Gines, Rociana del Condado, Gibrale√≥n, San Juan del Puerto, Bonares and La Palma del Condado and Los Palacios. The rest of the groups, located in Andalusia or outside of it, would take less than 1,000 pilgrims each. Non-affiliated brotherhoods and other groupings There are nineteen non-affiliated brotherhoods constituted in public association and eight as private associations recognized by the sisterhood. Although there are five Andalusians among them, the majority have emerged in the field of Andalusian emigration, especially in the main areas of destination of this migratory current Catalonia and Madrid. There are also rociera groups without character of brotherhood recognized by the parent brotherhood, sixteen in Andalusia, nine in the rest of Spain and nine in other states of the world (of which five in Argentina and the other four distributed among Brazil, Puerto Rico, Bolivia and Australia) . Among the international ones, some are related to Andalusian collectivities (like some of the Argentine).

He remained in the state for the rest of his life. George Ellsworth Boomer (1862-1915) was an American socialist journalist, newspaper editor, and political activist. Boomer is best remembered as a key participant in the formation of the Socialist Party of Washington and as its candidate for the Governor of Washington in 1908. Biography=Early years George Ellsworth Boomer was born November 28, 1862 in Lewiston, Maine, the son of workers in a cotton mill.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle: A Memoir. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; pg. 17. Due to the family's poverty, Boomer himself soon went to work in the mills, taking a job which paid him 65 cents for each 12-hour day. Boomer attended school three months a year, as required by law, until he reached the age of 14, at which time he dropped out.\\"George E. Boomer,\\" The Commonwealth [Everett], whole no. 134 (July 24, 1913), pg. 4. Boomer worked for a time as a newsboy, a job which brought him into contact with the world of newspaper publishing. He eventually found a first job in the industry assisting with the production of the Greenback Labor Chronicle of Auburn, Maine. In the fall of 1882, Boomer moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he joined the newly organized International Typographical Union the following year. Boomer remained a member of that union throughout his life. He was a member of the Rhode Island Central Labor Union for 8 years and its president for 2. In June 1884, Boomer married Mary A. Vickery.Steven L., \\"Ungovernor, 1908: George Ellsworth Boomer,\\" Oly Blog, Olympia, WA. Retrieved April 15, 2010. Political career Cartoon of George Boomer from his 1908 gubernatorial campaign. Boomer joined the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in 1884. Boomer ran on the SLP's ticket for Governor of Rhode Island for the first time in 1893. Boomer also published the Providence SLP and trade unionist newspaper, Justice, for a period of three years. In 1895, Boomer again ran for Governor of Rhode Island, heading the SLP ticket.\\"Rhode Island: Interesting Sketch of the Late Elections,\\" The People [New York], vol. 5, no. 4 (April 21, 1895), pg. 1. Boomer received more votes than any other SLP candidate in the election, a total of 1,709 out of about 43,000 ballots cast (4%). In 1896, Boomer published an independent socialist newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland known as Uncle Sam. He came into contact with J.A. Wayland in this capacity and in 1897 relocated to Southeast Kansas to work on the editorial staff of Wayland's popular socialist weekly, The Appeal to Reason. It was in this capacity that he learned of a group of devoted socialists, organized as the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth (BCC), who sought to establish a socialist colony on the American frontier in the new state of Washington. Boomer was smitten with the idea and he departed for the West Coast in the spring of 1898, bringing with him the knowledge of newspaper promotion which he had garnered in Girard under Wayland's employ. Boomer took charge of the colony's newspaper, Industrial Freedom, and initiated Wayland-style folksy editorial patter to the front page, writing his column under the headline \\"Thoughts, by Your Uncle\\" while using the pseudonym \\"Uncle Sam.\\" Boomer was not long with the Equalty colony, however, soon departing rural Skagit County for a more close approximation of civilization in Tacoma when the colony refused to participate in political action. In December 1898 Boomer established a short-lived new socialist newspaper in Tacoma, the Spirit of '76, a publication supportive of the SLP. Boomer never joined the Social Democratic Party of America headed by radical trade unionist Eugene V. Debs and Victor L. Berger, instead forming his own socialist educational organization ‚Äî a group which maintained an independent existence until after the formation of the Socialist Party of America in the summer of 1901. Boomer would merge his local group into the Socialist Party shortly after its formation. In 1902, Boomer launched a new socialist weekly in Tacoma, The Sun.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle, pp. 17-18. He was elected to the first State Committee of the Socialist Party of Washington (SPW) and served two terms as the SPW's representative on the governing National Committee of the Socialist Party of America in 1902 and 1903. Although identified with the left wing of the party, Boomer was also recognized as a peacemaker, being dispatched to Utah by the National Committee in 1902 to help broker a truce between warring party factions in Utah. In 1903, Boomer, now married a second time to a woman 18 years his junior named Alice, headed east of the Cascades to Prosser, a small town in Central Washington. There he switched the political orientation of the town's newspaper, the Prosser Record, from the Democratic Party to the Socialist Party and continued to edit it until 1909. Boomer worked hard to modernize and expand his paper, moving to automated typesetting and expanding the paper from 4 pages to 8. Circulation grew to 4,000. During this interval Boomer also periodically contributed a column to The Socialist, the revolutionary socialist weekly published in Seattle by Hermon F. Titus, writing under the pen name \\"Uncle Sam.\\"Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle, pg. 18.

On the campaign trail in 1908, Boomer was rotten-egged by listeners hostile to his message in Ellensburg. The Boomers sold their newspaper in May 1909 and moved back across the Cascades to Seattle. There George Boomer edited at least one issue of The Wage Worker, Titus's successor to The Socialist established after the decision of Washington's left wing socialists to bolt the 1909 Convention of the Socialist Party of Washington and to form instead a new organization, the Wage Workers Party. Both the paper and the party proved to be short-lived. The Boomers, baby daughter Mildred in tow, moved to Leavenworth, Washington in 1910, where George worked as a printer. George Boomer in 1913, just two years prior to his death. Boomer moved to Bremerton, Washington in 1912 where he edited another local newspaper, the Kitsap County Leader. While soapboxing in the nearby town of Port Townsend, Boomer was attacked by a soldier from the nearby fort, an event which caused outrage in the Socialist community when the local judge refused to issue an arrest warrant for the attacker, instead declaring from the bench that the Socialists should all be thrown into the bay and that he would be glad to assist.News report in Everett Commonwealth, cited in O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle, pg. 18. In 1913, Boomer returned to Seattle where he helped to edit The Barbarian, a left wing satirical weekly. The following year he moved to Port Angeles, where he edited the Peninsula Free Press. Boomer made one last political run as the Socialist Party's candidate for U.S. Congress in Washington's 2nd District in 1914.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"George E.

Originally powered by a pulsejet engine, then later developed as an improved turbojet- powered aircraft, the Q-1 failed to win the favor of the USAF. However, the aircraft provided the basis of the GAM-67 Crossbow anti-radar missile. Design and development Shortly after its formation in 1948, the United States Air Force issued a specification calling for a new type of high-speed target drone. Required to be jet-powered to provide the most realistic training, the contract for the development of the drone was given to the Radioplane Company, later a division of Northrop. Powered by a single Giannini PJ39 pulsejet engine, the drone, given the designation RP-26 by the company and XQ-1 by the USAF, was a high-wing, rocket sled launched aircraft. Originally fitted with a large single vertical stabiliser, the design was modified to a twin tail configuration to provide additional clearance of its carrier aircraft. Recovery, following the conclusion of the drone's flight, was by parachute. Operational history The first flight of the XQ-1 prototype took place in 1950; 28 aircraft of the type were built. Although the aircraft proved to be mostly satisfactory, the thirsty nature of the pulsejet engine limited the drone's endurance to a mere 60 minutes.Yenne 2004, p.21. In an attempt to increase the potential flight time of the aircraft, one XQ-1 was re-engined with a Continental YJ69 turbojet replacing the pulsejet, becoming the XQ-1A; however it was determined that further improvements were needed, and so a major redesign of the type was undertaken. Known by the company as RP-50 and designated by the USAF as YQ-1B, the revised drone flew for the first time during 1953, being evaluated by the Air Force later that year. Using the YJ69 engine, the air intake for the jet was relocated to the nose of the aircraft, while the airframe overall was modified to increase the streamlining of the craft. The rocket-sled launch was abandoned in favor of air launching, with the Douglas DB-26 being the most common carrier aircraft. Six YQ-1Bs were built for evaluation; they proved trouble-free, no production order for the type was undertaken, the competing Ryan Q-2 drone having been selected for operational service instead; as a result, the Q-1 program was terminated. However, the YQ-1B airframe was used by Radioplane as the start of development of a new anti-radar missile, which would be tested by the U.S. Air Force as the GAM-67 Crossbow.Newcomb 2004, p.72.

Location The camp is in Pukchang County and Tukchang district, P'y≈èngan-namdo province in North Korea. It is situated along the middle reaches of Taedong river, which forms the northern boundary of the camp, and also includes the mountains south of the river.

Possibly these sections were completely separated earlier and therefore there are the two names Pukchang and Tukchang.‚ÄùCurious about Dukjang Gulag Where Jeong Ha Cheol Has Been Imprisoned?‚Äù, The Daily NK, December 14, 2005 While all the other political prison camps belong to the State Security Department, Pukchang camp is run by the Interior Ministry.The 9th International Conference on North Korea Human Rights and Refugees, Melbourne, March 20, 2009 (page 28) In some cases political prisoners were deported to Kaechon camp, while their relatives (parents, children, siblings, grandchildren) were deported to Pukchang camp. Only based on their kinship they are classified as politically unreliable and are imprisoned without any lawsuit or conviction. The camp is around in area‚ÄùNorth Koreas Hard Labor Camps‚Äú with interactive map, Washington Post, July 20, 2009 and is surrounded by a fence. There are several prison labor colonies with barracks for the prisoners and housing for the guards: the 4th, 5th, and 6th divisions. Family members are often allowed to live together.

Rules in Pukchang camp seem to be slightly less strict compared to the human rights situation in other political prison camps. But also in this camp, prisoners are shot in cases of escape attempts, theft of food or violations of instructions. Kim witnessed more than 100 public executions per year with prisoners being tortured and then shot or hanged as a deterrent to the other prisoners. The most common causes of death are malnutrition, work accidents and illnesses. Kim reported that in the 1990s her family only received of corn per month and occasionally some bean paste (Doenjang) or salt. * * In order to survive they had to search for edible plants, leaves and insects. * * She saw many bodies of starved or executed people lying all around the roads and even reported cases of cannibalism. Since the prisoners have to work 16‚Äì18 hours in the mines every day without any protection, after few years most suffer from pneumoconiosis and many die from it. Kim developed a pulmonary tumor because of the inhaled dust. Work accidents often lead to limb amputations. Many children have frostbite, because they have no shoes and have to go barefoot even in winter. Kim reported that the prisoners have no human rights and are treated at the guards‚Äô mercy. To humiliate the prisoners, the guards would force them to get on their knees, and then spit into the prisoner's mouths and make them swallow the spit. If prisoners do not immediately obey, they are savagely beaten. The prisoners are monitored almost continuously by security agents and are urged to spy on each other and to denounce other prisoners. Reported closure and re-opening According to some sources, the camp ceased operations in 2006. The satellite images however show that the mine inside the camp is still operating with civilian laborers. It is likely that some parts of the camp still hold political prisoners, but most of the former camp area has stopped functioning as a labor camp. In 2016 it was reported that camp 18 had either been re-opened or merged with camp 14 on the other side of the river. Satellite images showed a new security perimeter and increased activity in the area. There also seemed to be an operational ferry between the two camps, giving the suggestion that the camps may have merged.

It is known for its natural environment and also known as an area crossed by Alexander the Great. Later, after the Lal Masjid battle, Kuza Bandai and Bara Bandai became sympathetic to the Taliban movement. The village consists of Yusufzai Pakhtun tribes. It is one of Pakistan's Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA). Name The name of the village means \\"lower meadow.\\" A neighbouring village is known as Bara Bandai, which means \\"upper meadow.\\" \\"Meadow\\" on account of their greenery and \\"upper\\" or \\"lower\\" referring to the distance of the villages from either Mingora, Saidu Sharif or the mountainous areas of Swat. The ancient names of these villages are not known and are simply mentioned by location in old time books and scripts. Location Kuza Bandai is located at is about from Mingora (the main city of Swat) and Saidu Sharif (capital city of Swat). It is on the left bank of the Swat river in Nikpikhel. The acknowledged area of Nikpikhel varies from Bara Bandai and Ningolai village to Kala Kali village on the left bank of the river. Kuza Bandai is about from Kalam. On the other side of the village is a series of mountains that connect to other villages and finally ends the region of Swat valley. Beyond them is Dir district. On the right side lies the river Swat and after that Sangota, Manglawar and Fizagat villages. History Kuza Bandai was first mentioned by ancient Greek writers as the pass of Alexander the Great. After entering the subcontinent through the Himalayas, Alexander came to Swat, where his army rested for two days on the left bank of the river in Kuza Bandai. After Alexander, the Buddhists came and settled there . Ruins of ancient homes and small buildings built by Buddhists can be found in the mountains of Kuza Bandai and other nearby villages. Mahmood of Ghazni, the great Afghan Pakhtun conqueror came on his way to attack the Indian subcontinent, and defeated the Buddhist maharajahs there. Some of his army and Muslims from Afghanistan settled there, becoming known as old Swatis. They had lived there for about a century when the Yusufzai tribe came from Afghanistan and attacked the valley. It is said that the Yusufzai visited the area and liked it because of its greenery and so they decided to take it from the old Swatis by force. The Yusufzai tribe were famous for their fighting skills and bravery. They were engaged in many wars in Afghanistan. After the war, the Yusufzai caused the old Swatis to flee. The Yusufzais settled in the valley where they are today. During the rule of Mughal King Akbar, the Yusufzai in Swat were attacked three times by the Mughal emperor because the Mughals thought Yusufzais might be a danger to them, because they had left Afghanistan because of another Mughal emperor, Alagh Baig. The Mughal army lost all three battles and suffered heavy casualties. A graveyard in the Bunair district is known as the graveyard of Mughals. It hosts hundreds of Mughal soldiers who were killed in the war. After the defeat King Akbar made peace with the Yusufzais by establishing a personal relationship with Malik Ahmad Khan. In the late 18th century, the Yusufzai tribe of Swat refused to submit to the British Raj. The British sent an army of 32,000 soldiers, most of them Sikhs. According to the British, Sikhs were good warriors and could handle the martial race of Yusufzai Pakhtuns. The operation was planned to be completed in six weeks, but lingered on for six months and eventually resulted in a defeat for the British as the 35th Sikh regiment lost the defining battle with heavy casualties. Most of the soldiers were slaughtered by the Yusufzai, and those who escaped were unable to continue fighting. Following the battle the tribal chiefs of Swat sought to create their own state, as the area was not secure from the British, nor from the nawab of Dir district (a princely state at that time). Consequently, they held a jirga and decided to make Miangul Abdul Wadood their undisputed king. As he was a syed (a man from a holy race), no Pakhtun tribe wanted to go against him, leaving Swat a princely state.

It has been speculated that he may have contracted the disease as a result of a tick bite. Krogh was diagnosed with Lyme disease in the fall of 2009. He was immediately hospitalized at the Borreliose Centrum in Augsburg, Germany, and remained there for four weeks. However, he was by then already so weak from his illness that the physicians were unable to administer the recommended dosages of antibiotics. He received some palliative herbal remedies before he was discharged into the care of his family.

The National Hotel epidemic was a mysterious sickness which afflicted persons who stayed at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C. beginning in early January 1857.\\"The Washington Epidemic\\", New York Daily Times, March 23, 1857, pg. 2. At the time, the hotel was the largest in the city.Redman, Brian Francis (2009). \\"What Would Millard Do?\\", Findings of the Friends of Millard Fillmore, pg. 53. By some accounts, as many as 400 people became sick and nearly three dozen died. The illness was considered by some medical experts to have originated from an attempt to poison hotel boarders. It affected mostly patrons of the hotel's dining room and not those who frequented the bar. It began to spread more noticeably by the middle of January 1857. New cases of the illness began to decrease in number by the end of January 1857 and continued to abate until the middle of February. When the numbers of guests increased for the presidential inauguration of March 4, 1857, the sickness returned again forcefully. Symptoms The National Hotel epidemic manifested itself as a persistent diarrhea, which was often accompanied by an intense colic. Victims experienced sudden prostration along with nausea. The tongues of patients generally indicated an inflammation of the mucous membranes of their stomachs. Sufferers often complained of recurrences of symptoms even after leaving the National Hotel. Aside from a sudden onset of diarrhea, which happened generally in the early morning, vomiting occurred after the diarrhea ceased. Major George McNeir, 64, of Washington, D.C., dined at the National Hotel at the time of the first outbreak of the epidemic. Dr. Jas J. Waring was among the physicians who performed an autopsy on McNeir. He was the only person whose body was subjected to a post-mortem examination after he died from the sickness. Waring stated that there was no incubation period before the onset of McNeir's illness. He was affected by the time he went to bed following dinner, and the symptoms never left him until his death.National Hotel Epidemic, American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January 1858, Volume 69, Issue 1, pg. 97. Theories A physician quoted by Philadelphia's The Times newspaper vocalized the poison theory. However, dissenters contended that poisoned water was improbable because the National Hotel's water tank was used only for washing. Drinking water was brought to the establishment from a distance.\\"The Washington Epidemic\\", New York Daily Times, April 3, 1857, pg. 5. In an effort to eliminate rats from the National Hotel, arsenic was used. One of the poisoned rats was discovered in the water tank after guests became ill with the sickness.Columbia Historical Society of Washington, Vol. 57‚Äì59, 1961, pg. 120. The Mayor of Washington, D.C., together with a committee chosen by the board of health, submitted a report that denied that any mineral poisoning was ingested in the stomachs of victims of the epidemic. There was no evidence of inflammation of the intestines. The committee contended that the disease was transmitted by inhalation of a poisonous miasma that originated from the decomposition of vegetables and animals. They thought the infection entered the National Hotel from a sewer, which was connected to the Sixth Street sewer. A sewer builder noticed a sewer opening in the southwest corner of the National Hotel which connected with the sewer leading into the street. Through the opening proceeded a constant fetid gas, which was coming in rapidly enough to extinguish a candle flame, according to the individual's estimation. The committee looked without finding evidence of water poisoning, food poisoning, or arsenic poisoning.\\"The Washington Epidemic-Report of the Committee of the Board of Health\\", New York Daily Times, March 25, 1857, pg. 2.  Deaths  Among the three dozen or so deaths were several members of Congress: * Representative John Montgomery of Pennsylvania died in April 1857. * Representative John Quitman of Mississippi died in July 1858 from the disease's aftereffects. Quitman had also served as a major general during the Mexican War. * Former Representative David Robison of Pennsylvania died in June 1859 of complications from the disease he‚Äôd contracted at the hotel. James Buchanan's nephew also died due to this epidemic. He had originally been set to hold the position of the president's personal secretary.Walton, Jennifer. C-Span.

It is located on the eastern side of Park Avenue between 41st and 42nd streets, across from Grand Central Terminal to the north and adjacent to 110 East 42nd Street to the east. The Pershing Square Building was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by Sloan & Robertson in conjunction with York and Sawyer. It was erected within \\"Terminal City\\", a collection of buildings located above the underground tracks surrounding Grand Central, and makes use of real-estate air rights above the tracks. The building is located directly above the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station. The Pershing Square Building, as well as 110 East 42nd Street, were built on the site of the Grand Union Hotel. Construction started in 1921 and was completed in 1923. Ownership of the Pershing Square Building passed to several companies; the latest such change occurred in 2010, when SL Green Realty bought the building. It was made a New York City designated landmark in 2016.  Description  left The building was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by the firms of Sloan & Robertson and York & Sawyer. The design shares many elements with 110 East 42nd Street directly to the east, which was also designed by York & Sawyer.  Form  John Sloan's plan for the Pershing Square Building called for a U-shaped tower above a five-story rectangular base, used in many other New York City skyscrapers erected before the 1916 Zoning Resolution. Above that would be a 14-story middle section, with a recessed \\"light court\\" on the eighth floor, followed by a five-story top section and two recessed attic floors. The original plans called for shops and restaurants in the first floor and basement. The design was later changed to fit with the neighboring 110 East 42nd Street. As ultimately built, the structure rises from a square 7-story base with 3-story-high decorative arches on the lowest three floors. The tower above the seventh floor continues in a U-shaped configuration to the top floor. The second floor would be high and would be used as a banking floor. The 20 floors above it were to be used as office floors. The wall between the Pershing Square Building and 110 East 42nd was made of hollow tile, as a brick wall would have been too heavy for the foundation, and would have necessitated the removal of the top five or six stories of both buildings. Sloan also had to design the top floors in order to meet the conditions that the BSA had set in exchange for allowing the Pershing Square Building's zoning variance. For instance, since the cornice could not project more than from the building lot line, Sloan's design incorporated corbelling at the top of the facade, and a setback two-story attic above the 23rd floor. The 24th-floor attic is located about behind the building boundary and mostly consists of one story with a hip roof. There are also gable-roofed 25th-story penthouses at 41st and 42nd Streets. The attics, with their roofs made of red tiles, resembled \\"a villa on the hilltop\\", as described by architect Charles Downing Lay.  Facade  The building facade is clad in beige brick, with elaborate decoration designed by Sloan and produced by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company. The facade contains a similar color to that of 110 East 42nd Street, with tan-gray Ohio sandstone cladding, as well as similar arcades, vertical strips, and cornice design. Sloan's mixture of Romanesque and Renaissance Lombard detailing on the Pershing Square Building contrasted with the near-exclusive use of Italian Romanesque details on 110 East 42nd's facade. The Pershing Square Building was described as being among the \\"first skyscrapers in which brick cladding was used for decorative purposes\\", and the unprecedented material usage led the New York City Department of Buildings to publish a special report on the facade. The decorated terracotta tiles were manufactured by Atlantic Terra Cotta, which used small pieces to provide a similarity with the brick cladding. Atlantic Terra Cotta roughened the terracotta pieces before burning them so that they would appear to be a rough surface. The tiles' colors were characterized by Atlantic Terra Cotta's journal as \\"a soft gray fire-flashed with golden brown\\". The color spotting was meant to \\"tone the marked variations down into a softly harmonious play of color\\". Much of the ornamentation is located at the base, particularly around the banking facility on the second floor. These decorations include columns whose capitals depict dolphins, shields, and eagles. One of the figures at the fifth-floor level represents a Roman caduceator, or peace commissioner. He holds a caduceus in one hand as an emblem of office and, in the other, a cornucopia to suggest the benefits of a prospective peace.  Subway entrance  The New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station, serving the , is located directly underneath the northwest corner of the Pershing Square Building. Within the building, two stairs lead from Park Avenue to the subway station.  History = Site  The completion of the underground Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, and a corresponding increase in real-estate prices. Among these were the New York Central Building at 47th Street and Park Avenue, as well as the Grand Central Palace across 42nd Street from the present Pershing Square Building. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called \\"a great civic centre\\". In 1913, the Dual Contracts were signed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), two companies who operated parts of the present New York City Subway. A set of platforms at Grand Central, now serving the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (), was to be built diagonally under the building site as part of the agreement. At the time, the site under the proposed station was occupied by Grand Union Hotel, which was condemned via eminent domain in February 1914. The condemnation proceedings for the hotel cost $3.5 million (equal to $ million in ). To pay the station's construction cost, the Public Service Commission approved the construction of a 25-story building above the station. By May 1915, the building site had been excavated for the construction of the building. Despite the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required architectural setbacks to provide light to the streets below, the building plans conformed with the older zoning codes, which did not require setbacks. Though the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 42nd Street station opened in 1918, the site above the station was not developed as planned. The 25-story building's site, and the portion of Park Avenue immediately adjacent to it, was renamed Pershing Square in 1919 to honor World War I general John J. Pershing. The site was then proposed for use as an open plaza with a three-story memorial \\"Victory Hall\\", but the idea of a victory hall was opposed by Fiorello H. La Guardia, president of the New York City Board of Aldermen. The Transit Commission attempted to sell the building site in May 1920 for $2.8 million (equal to $ million in ), but no one placed a bid. Then in July 1920, a realty consortium headed by investor Henry Mandel offered $2.9 million for the hotel (equal to $ million in ), a proposal that was accepted. Other members of this consortium included the accountant Samuel D. Leidesdorf.  Planning and construction  110 East 42nd Street (left) and the Pershing Square Building (right) share what was believed to be New York City's tallest party wall By September 1920, Mandel had created the Pershing Square Building Corporation, of which he was majority stockholder. The corporation was headed by Leidesdorf. In January 1921, the Pershing Square Building Corporation received title to the site, with conditions that necessitated a subway entrance and a maximum building height and weight. Mandel gave the Bowery Savings Bank the eastern half of the hotel site, which would be developed into an office building at 110 East 42nd Street. As per the purchase agreement between the bank and the corporation, the structures were to contain interlocking structures, including what was believed to be the city's tallest party wall separating two buildings. Mandel hired architect John Sloan to create a design for a building, and Sloan had submitted preliminary plans by May 1921. According to Sloan's plans, the structure would contain no setbacks, contravening the 1916 Zoning Resolution. Though the Fifth Avenue Association filed a complaint with the city's Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) to enforce the zoning code, Sloan stated that the inclusion of setbacks would be structurally unsafe, expensive, as well as a contravention of the existing agreement. The BSA ruled in favor of the Pershing Square Building Corporation, as the footings had been laid before the zoning resolution was passed. As such, the Pershing Square Building was the last tall building constructed after the 1916 Zoning Resolution that did not contain setbacks or a front plaza. The firm York and Sawyer was designated as the building's new primary architects in September 1921, and Sloan received a $10,000 payment and architectural credit in return for giving his drawings to York and Sawyer (). The architects were also designing the adjacent 110 East 42nd Street. By the next month, the plans were finalized, and construction was imminent. That month, the opponents appealed the BSA's decision to the statewide Court of Appeals. In April 1922, S.W. Straus & Co. underwrote a $6 million mortgage loan for the building (equal to $ million in ). By then, excavation had been nearly completed, and the first lessees had already signed for space in the building. John York of York & Sawyer then requested that Sloan remain on the project to devise the preliminary plans. Sloan later sued York & Sawyer over the latter's failure to pay compensation, resulting in a $14,260 architect's fee being paid out to Sloan in 1928 (). Sloan would form a partnership with Thomas Markoe Robertson in 1923, and in addition to co- designing the Pershing Square Building, the pair would design the Pershing Square Building and several other New York City structures, including the Chanin Building and Graybar Building in the Grand Central area.  Later history  When the Pershing Square Building was completed in 1923, it immediately became popular among tenants, A mezzanine above the second floor, also designed by Sloan, was added in 1924 when Pacific Bank rented space in the building. The following year, in 1925, real estate operator Louis Frankel filed a lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court against Samuel Leidesdorf, alleging that he had been denied the profits from the Pershing Square Building's construction, and sought to have all stock in the Pershing Square Building Corporation transferred to him. The State Supreme Court subsequently ruled against Frankel. The Pershing Square Building was renamed the Continental Can Building when the American Can Company leased space in the 24th and 25th floors in 1945. This name was dropped in 1970, and the following year the Leidesdorf estate sold the Pershing Square Building to Prudential Financial. In 1977, Prudential sold the building to an anonymous West German investor for $24 million (about $ million in ) by transferring ownership to Suttom NV, a company based in the Netherlands Antilles. After Suttom NV sold the building in 1994, it passed through numerous ownerships, including GE Capital (1994), 125 Park Avenue LLC (1997); GE Capital subsidiary Watch Holdings LLC (1998); and Sri Six Operating Company (2004). The real estate firm Shorenstein Properties had a stake in Sri Six. SL Green, the owner purchased the building in 2010 from Shorenstein Properties. The Pershing Square Building received several renovations, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. The upper floors' masonry and windows were replaced; the ground-level facades at Park Avenue and 42nd Street were renovated; and the lobby was renovated with a new 42nd Street entrance in 2006‚Äì2008. In November 2016, the Pershing Square Building and ten other nearby buildings were designated historic landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.  Tenants  Vanderbilt Avenue, looking toward the western facadealt= A New- York Tribune article in January 1923 stated that, although the Pershing Square Building was not complete yet, its space was 60% leased. At the time, the lessees included International Paper and the Royal Baking Powder Company, as well as York & Sawyer's own offices. The second-floor banking space was leased by Pacific Bank in 1924, and the company added a mezzanine above the existing hall. Attorneys, realtors, and insurance and investment companies also took space in the building, as did those in the architecture and building construction industry. The Pershing Square Building served as a hub or offices for several transportation companies in the bus and aviation industries. In 1929, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad started using the Pershing Square Building as one of its waiting rooms for intercity buses, after its previous terminal at Pennsylvania Station had closed down. Besides American Airlines, other airlines such as Trans-Canada Air Lines and Northwest Airlines also rented space in the building. Manhattan Air Terminal, Inc. opened an airline ticket office in the Pershing Square Building's banking room mezzanine in 1972, selling tickets for flights on various airlines. There were numerous tenants who took space in the Pershing Square Building for several decades. These included Pacific Bank, who occupied the second and second-mezzanine floors starting in 1924; American Maize Products Company, which moved into the building in 1929; the company of advertiser William Esty, which rented the entire 23rd floor in 1930; and the executive offices of American Airlines, which rented four floors in 1943. From 1945 to 1970, the building was named for the American Can Company, who took up the 24th and 25th floors. The electronics company Philips started occupying space in the Pershing Square Building in the 1950s and still retained a presence in the building by 2016. Pandora Media and Robert Half International were among the other relatively recent companies who took space in the building, while Canon USA subsidiary MCS Business Solutions moved its headquarters to 125 Park Avenue in 1998. The furniture company Haworth moved to the Pershing Square Building in 2007, taking up the former banking floor and airline ticket office on the second floor and mezzanine.  Critical reception  The Pershing Square Building's brick-clad facade was unprecedented at the time of its construction, The architect Robert A. M. Stern, in his book New York 1930, called the use of brick ornamentation on the Pershing Square Building's brick facade \\"increasingly important\\" as the Lombard Revival architectural movement grew in New York City in later years. Later reviews were more critical; in 2013, the Real Estate Board of New York published a report claiming that the Pershing Square Building's design \\"was old-fashioned even before it was finished\\". Real Estate Weekly said in July 2016, prior to the building's landmark designation that November, that \\"The building is notably absent from the AIA Guide for New York City\\", a guidebook of architecturally significant structures in New York City.

Biography He was educated at the military academy in Hanover, and came to New York in 1826, with the intention of entering the Brazilian army. Unfavorable accounts of the conditions in Brazil induced him to remain in the United States, and he became well known as an engineer. In 1827 he made many surveys in Charleston, South Carolina, and vicinity for the Charleston & Hamburg Railroad and Canal Co., and in 1828 made the drawings for the first locomotive built by the Kembles in New York. His survey work was completed in 1830. 1833-1834 he was in the employ of the U. S. War Department, and superintended the laying of the foundations of Fort Sumter during the illness of the engineer in charge of the work. After making surveys for railroads in various parts of the country, he became interested in the manufacture of iron, and introduced several improvements, including the utilization of the waste gases from blast and other furnaces. 1845-1852 he engaged in this manufacture in Lonaconing, Maryland. He was named chief architect and engineer of the New York Crystal Palace, but clashed repeatedly with the two architects who actually designed the building, Georg Carstensen and Karl Gildemeister, ultimately depriving them of credit for their work.Edwin G. Burrows, The Finest Building in Americ: The New York Crystal Palace 1853-1858 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018). Detmold hired Horatio Allen, an associate during his surveying work, as consulting engineer. Afterward, he spent some years traveling in Europe. He then became president of the New Jersey Zinc Company, built their works at Newark, and originated and successfully developed the manufacture of ‚Äúspiegel‚Äù iron from the residue of the zinc ore. He then engaged in coal mining. Failing health forced him to go to Europe, where he lived, most of the time in Paris, until his return to New York in 1885. He published a translation of the principal historical, political, and diplomatic writings of Machiavelli (4 vols., Boston, 1882). He also collected art. Family He married Phoebe Crary and had two daughters. His brother, William Ludwig Detmold, was a noted surgeon who introduced orthopedic surgery into the United States.

Pictured is Herdis Bexell, a relative of Alfred Bexell The Bexell Cottage (Swedish: Bexellska stugan) is a small cottage in Varberg, Sweden. It has been turned into a historical heritage mini-museum. In Bexell Cottage there are furnitures and painted wall tapestry from the 19th century. The tapestry cover the walls and ceiling of the cottage. Originally, they were only used for Christmas, but today they are posted all the year around. Bexell Cottage can be visited by the public at the shows of the cottage that are arranged by Halland Museum of Cultural History. History The Bexell Cottage was originally built in 1785 at Harplinge. In 1876, it was bought by member of parliament and local land owner Alfred Bexell (1831‚Äì1900) Ernest Gustav Detlov Alfred Bexell (22 November 1831-3 May 1900) from its owner J√∂ns J√∂nsson (born 1828) together with all interior possessions. J√∂nsson was only allowed to retain his day dress, according to the purchase agreement. Even J√∂nsson's snuffbox passed to the ownership of Bexell. Alfred Bexell was the first in Sweden who bought and protected a Swedish peasant's home with the intent of turning it into a museum. He inspired Arthur Hazelius to establish the open-air museum Skansen in Stockholm. After Alfred Bexell's death, his widow Cecilia Bexell (1843‚Äì1929) moved the cottage to Varberg in 1907. The museum continued until 1915 after which Cecilia Bexell sold most of the items in the Bexellian collections at auction. Many of the auction items were bought by a local association formed with the intention of operating a museum. In the 20th century, it was called b√•lastugan, a Hallandic name of the type of cottage. In 2003, it became a part of Halland Museum of Cultural History. At present it is named Bexell Cottage. Bexell's Stones Alfred Bexell also created a different kind of \\"museum\\" in a forested area which he owned, east of Varberg (northeast of the smaller village of Rolfstorp.The forested area is north of the Rolfstorp golf course, at 57.1690N/12.4813E.) The area has become famous, after visitors in 1925 began discovering rocks engraved with sayings, names of noted people of the time, or mottos. They were all commissioned by Bexell during the end of the nineteenth century, and were carved by two stonemasons whom he hired for the purpose. His diaries describe his causing the engravings but do not explain his motive. In 2014 an effort was mounted to discover the extent of the engravings; as of 2016 some 600 names of famous writers, philosophers, scientists, politicians and statesmen have been identified in the carvings, as well as more than 180 aphorisms, sayings, quotes from literature, and Bexell‚Äôs thoughts. The messages include: \\"Do not say all you know but always know what you say\\"; and \\"What is sleep but the image of death.\\" Bexell's own tombstone is inscribed with: \\"Man‚Äôs history is his character.\\"Bexell's Talking Stones, Atlas Obscura (December 2016) ReferencesOther sources *Margareta Str√∂mbom (2007) B√•lastugan: Bexellska rygg√•sstugan, f√∂reg√•ngare till friluftsmuseet Skansen i Stockholm ; ett unikt svenskt kulturarv (Varberg: CAL-F√∂rlagets) External links *Halland Museum of Cultural History website *Bexellska stugan website Category:Buildings and structures in Varberg Category:Museums in Halland County Category:Historic house museums in Sweden ","title":"Bexell Cottage"},{"id":"26967390","text":"C. australis may refer to: * Ceuthmochares aereus, the Yellowbill, a bird species found in Africa * Chaetorellia australis, the yellow starthistle peacock fly, a fly species native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean * Charadrius australis, the Inland Dotterel or Australian Dotterel, a medium- sized plover species found in Australia * Cirrhigaleus australis, the Southern Mandarin dogfish, a shark species * Citrus australis, the round lime or Australian lime, a large shrub or small tree found in Australia * Cordyline australis, the cabbage tree, a monocotyledon plant species endemic to New Zealand * Ctenomys australis, the Southern tuco-tuco, a rodent species endemic to Argentina. * Cyathea australis, the rough tree fern, a tree fern species native to Australia * Cyclaspis australis, a crustacean species in the genus Cyclaspis See also * Australis (disambiguation) ","title":"C. australis"},{"id":"26967437","text":"Ultimate Force is a 2005 action film written and directed by Mark Burson.

Performers took part in reenacting historic battles, demonstrating equestrianism and performing dances for audiences. Many veterans from the Great Plains Wars participated in Wild West shows, during a time when the Office of Indian Affairs was intent on promoting Native assimilation. Many went on to act in silent films. Introduction Often central to the popular image of the American West are American Indians, specifically northern Great Plains tribes, popularly characterized as dwelling in tipis, skilled in horseback riding, and hunting bison. The shaping of the western myth was aided in part through the Wild West shows of William Frederick \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, whose show toured the United States and Europe between 1883 and 1917.Bobby Bridger, Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull: Inventing the Wild West (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2002); Matthew Carter, Myth of the Western: New Perspectives on Hollywood's Frontier Narrative (Edinburgh University Press, 2014), 7-9. Native Americans were hired from the earliest stages of the show, first drawn from the Pawnee tribe (1883‚Äì1885) and then the Lakota tribe.Louis Warren, Buffalo Bill's America: William Cody and the Wild West Show (New York: Vintage, 2006), 191-194. The phrase \\"Show Indians\\" likely originated among newspaper reporters and editorial writers as early as 1891. By 1893, the term appeared frequently in the Office of Indian Affairs correspondence. Personnel refer to Indians employed in Wild West shows and other exhibitions using the phrase \\"Show Indian,\\" thereby indicating a form of professional status.L. G. Moses, \\"Indians on the Midway: Wild West Shows and the Indian Bureau at World's Fairs, 1893-1904,\\" South Dakota History (Fall 1991): 219. Native performers referred to themselves as oskate wicasa, or \\"show man.\\" Hiring practices Buffalo Bill Cody and Sitting Bull Hundreds of Native Americans would serve the show between 1883 and 1917. Performers were hired per season and were paid for their time with the show. Recruiting would happen in Rushville, Nebraska, just across the South Dakota‚ÄìNebraska border from the Pine Ridge Agency. Indians were central to the Wild West shows from the very beginning. In the first 1883 show in Omaha, Nebraska, six of the twelve performances, including the opening parade, employed Indians. Colonel Cody shifted his hiring to Pine Ridge Agency in 1885 after hiring the famous Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux, Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull carried a reputation as the killer of George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn and as the last Native American to surrender to the government during the American Indian Wars. He joined the show in Buffalo, New York, on June 12, 1885. Although he only toured for one season, Sitting Bull set the course for all subsequent Show Indian employment.Joy Kasson, Buffalo Bill's Wild West: Celebrity, Memory, and Popular History (New York: Hill and Wang, 2000), 169‚Äì183. His employment represented a shift to Lakota as the preferred Show Indian. The reputation of the Sioux as warriors confirmed the image of Indians held in American and European minds. The use of Native performers in the Wild West shows (as opposed to surrogates) reflected the broad interest in Native peoples within American culture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883‚Äì1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 2‚Äì5. Types of performances Show Indians contributed several performances to the Wild West shows. They showcased equestrianism, demonstrated their skills with bows and arrows, and exhibited their artistry in dance. The most memorable performances were the historical re-enactments in which performers recreated events in the recent past. Shows included Indian attacks on settlers' cabins, stagecoaches, pony-express riders, and wagon trains. Originating with Buffalo Bill, between 1885 and 1898, the shows also re-enacted the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of George Armstrong Custer as well as the Wounded Knee Massacre after that incident in 1890.L. G. Moses, \\"Indians on the Midway: Wild West Shows and the Indian Bureau at World's Fairs, 1893‚Äì1904,\\" South Dakota History (Fall 1991): 207. The performances provided Native Americans with an avenue to continue participating in cultural practices deemed illegal on Indian reservations. Vine Deloria, Jr. notes that Buffalo Bill and the first generation of Show Indians spent their time \\"playing\\" Indian as a form of refusal to abandon their culture. \\"Perhaps they realized in the deepest sense, that even a caricature of their youth was preferable to a complete surrender to the homogenization that was overtaking American society,\\" he wrote.Vine Deloria, \\"The Indians,\\" 56. The Wild West shows provided a space to be Indian and remain free of harassment from missionaries, teachers, agents, humanitarians, and politicians over the course of fifty years.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883‚Äì1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 277. Conflict over hiring Native Americans Wild West show contract of Philip Blue Shield, 1906 Protectionist groups, such as the Indian Rights Association and the Office of Indian Affairs, criticized the hiring of Native American performers on several grounds. Advocacy groups argued that a horrifying number of Indians died while employed by shows from alleged mistreatment and exploitation on behalf of Wild West show promoters.Cindy Fent and Raymond Wilson, \\"Indians Off Track: Cody's Wild West and the Melrose Park Train Wreck of 1904,\\" American Indian Culture and Research Journal, vol. 18, no. 3 (1994): 235‚Äì249. Reformers insisted that the supposed savagery of Native Americans needed to undergo the effects of civilization through land ownership, education, and industry. The logic of the reformers insisted that once Indians adopted new lifestyles, they would progress to a level approximating civilization.Robert A. Trennert Jr., \\"Selling Indian Education at World's Fairs and Expositions, 1893‚Äì1904,\\" American Indian Quarterly, vol. 11, no. 3 (Summer 1987): 203‚Äì220. The Office of Indian Affairs, on the other hand, worried about the effect of the shows on its assimilation policies. The battles between the government and show promoters was over whose image of American Indians would prevail.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 5. In 1886, the Office of Indian Affairs began regulating the hiring of Native American performers in the shows and, by 1889, required Indians to sign individual contracts with the shows under the supervision of OIA agents. Only after fulfilling the new stipulations of the OIA would the commissioner grant Indians permission to leave the reservation. The employment of Indians in unauthorized shows was particularly worrisome for the OIA, which feared that having Indians under the employ of a show without the guarantee of care and protection could lead to degrading employee health and morals.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883‚Äì1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 70‚Äì71. The Office of Indian Affairs, under Thomas Jefferson Morgan, who became commissioner in the summer of 1889, was especially critical of Indian employment in the Wild West shows. Although he could do little about the contracts already signed, he attacked in public and in print the seeming failures of the shows to meet the obligations of the contracts. When reviewing new contracts, he often turned them down or imposed requirements that the shows could not possibly meet, in effect preventing Indians from joining those shows. Morgan also threatened aspiring Indian performers by withholding land allotments, annuities, and tribal status and threatened show promoters with the loss of their bonds if they neglected to uphold their contractual obligations. The only acceptable outcome for Morgan was for Indians to quit the shows.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 73‚Äì79. In 1890, Indians named \\"No Neck\\" and \\"Black Heart\\" testified in an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. The hearing weighed the morality of Indian employment in show business. \\"You are engaged in the exhibition or show business,\\" observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. \\"It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. I believe that which is not good for the white people is not good for the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians.\\" The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show with those of the Pine Ridge Agency. The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. He worked in a show that fed him well; \\"that is why I am getting so fat,\\" he said, stroking his cheeks. It was only in returning to the reservation that \\"I am getting poor.\\" If the Great [White] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. But until then, \\"that is the way I get money.\\" When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying \\"I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children,\\" they were silenced. Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. \\"We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work.\\" Buffalo Bill Cody and Nate Salsbury \\"furnished us the same work we were raised to; that is the reason we want to work for these kind of men.\\"Buffalo Bill's America: William Cody and the Wild West Show By Louis S. Warren, at 372 (2005) On the road with Buffalo Bill Many of the \\"Show Indians\\" were Oglala Sioux from the Pine Ridge Agency, and welcomed the opportunity to travel with Colonel Cody. Native American performers and their families were able to free themselves for six months each year from the degrading confines of government reservations where they were forbidden to wear tribal dress, hunt or dance. Native American performers were treated well by Colonel Cody and received wages, food, transportation and living accommodation while far away from their homes. Show Indians were allowed to wear traditional clothing then forbidden on the reservation, and lived in the Wild West's tipi \\"village\\", weather permitting, where visitors would stroll and meet performers. When not performing, Native Americans were permitted to freely travel by automobile or by train, for sightseeing or visiting friends. Interpreters translated for the Native American performers inside and outside the Wild West camp. Show Indians agreed to obey the rules and regulations of the Wild West Company and Indian Police were organized to enforce the rules. The number of police chosen depended on the number of Indians traveling with the show each season, a usual ration being one policeman for every dozen Indians. Indian policemen selected from the ranks of the performers were given badges and paid $10 more in wages per month. Chiefs Iron Tail and Short Man were the leaders of the Indian Police in 1898.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), p.32. Chief Iron Tail managed the Indian Police and all performer were to refrain from all drinking, gambling and fighting.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), at p.15-32. The Indian Police wore badges, and most were former U.S. Army Indian Scouts. In addition to performing throughout the United States, Show Indians toured Europe. The first international trip was to London, England, on March 31, 1887. On the steam ship State of Nebraska, the show's entourage included eighty-three saloon passengers, thirty-eight steerage passengers, ninety-seven Indians, eighteen buffalos, two deer, ten elk, ten mules, five Texas steers, four donkeys, and one hundred and eight horses.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 42. The show was part of the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and toured through Birmingham, Salford, and London for five months. The show returned to Europe in 1889-1890 where it visited England, France, Italy, and Germany. World's Fairs and expositions In 1893, William F. Cody and other Wild West show promoters brought their show to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The Bureau of Indian Affairs agreed to sponsor and supervise the Columbian Exposition's American Indian Exhibit, which included a model Indian school and an Indian encampment. Financial difficulties, however, led the Bureau of Indian Affairs to withdraw its sponsorship and left the ethnological exhibit under the directorship of Frederick W. Putnam of Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.Robert A. Trennert, Jr., \\"Selling Indian Education at World's Fairs and Expositions, 1893-1904,\\" American Indian Quarterly (Summer 1987): 204-207. Despite being denied a place in the World's Fair, William F. Cody established a 14-acre swath of land near the main entrance of the fair for \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World,\\" where he erected stands around an arena large enough to seat 18 thousand spectators. 74 Indians from Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, who had recently returned from a tour of Europe, were contracted to perform in the show. Cody brought in an additional 100 Lakota from Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, and Rosebud reservations, who visited the fair at his expense and participated in the opening ceremonies.# Moses, L. G. \\"Indians on the Midway: Wild West Shows and the Indian Bureau at World's Fairs, 1893-1904.\\" South Dakota History (Fall 1991): 210-215. Over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's show in Chicago, often mistaking the show as an integral part to the World's Fair.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996), 137. Portrayal of Indians and the Wild West The popular image of Indians as living in tribes, sleeping in tipis, wearing feather headdresses, being equestrian, and hunting bison was fueled by the Great Plains serving as the principal source of Indian performers.L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933 (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1996).Brian W. Dippie, The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1982). The popular perception of the Sioux as the distinctive American Indian first emerged with early dime novel writers, then the Wild West shows maintained that image and it persisted through film, radio, and television westerns. Historian Robert F. Berkhofer, Jr. called the Wild West shows \\"dime novels come alive.\\"Robert F. Berkhofer Jr., The White Man's Indian: Images of the American Indian from Columbus to the Present (New York: Knopf, 1978), 100. The Wild West shows intended to celebrate American progress and technology by demonstrating the superiority of American history and society. The American West served as a formative characteristic in American exceptionalism. The frontier, according to Frederick Jackson Turner's famous thesis, was \\"breaking the average bond of custom, offering new experiences, [and] calling out new institutions and activities\\" that forged a unique American character rooted in individualism, self-sufficiency, and democratic institutions.Frederick Jackson Turner, \\"The Significance of the Frontier in American History.\\" Nate Salsbury, Cody's partner in the Wild West show, argued that the performances were accurate reflections of frontier life and viewed the show as a national narrative that represented the \\"true\\" West. Joy Kasson notes that \\"in a manner that has become familiar in the age of electronic popular culture, an entertainment spectacle was taken for 'the real thing,' and showmanship became inextricably entwined with its ostensible subject. Buffalo Bill's Wild West became America's Wild West.\\"Joy Kasson, Buffalo Bill's Wild West: Celebrity, Memory, and Popular History (New York: Hill and Wang, 2000), 15. In Cody's story of the West, Native Americans played a central role. Buffalo Bill and Gertrude K√§sebier Chief Iron Tail, Gertrude Kasebier, 1898, U.S. Library of Congress Gertrude K√§sebier was one of the most influential American photographers of the early 20th century. K√§sebier was known for her evocative images of motherhood, her powerful portraits of Native Americans and her promotion of photography as a career for women. In 1898, K√§sebier watched Buffalo Bill's Wild West troupe parade past her Fifth Avenue studio in New York City, toward Madison Square Garden.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), at p.13. Her memories of affection and respect for the Lakota people inspired her to send a letter to William \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody requesting permission to photograph in her studio members of the Sioux tribe traveling with the show. Cody and K√§sebier were similar in their abiding respect for Native American culture and maintained friendships with the Sioux. Cody quickly approved K√§sebier's request and she began her project on Sunday morning, April 14, 1898. K√§sebier's project was purely artistic and her images were not made for commercial purposes and never used in Buffalo Bill's Wild West program booklets or promotional posters.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007). K√§sebier took classic photographs of the Sioux while they were relaxed. Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk were among K√§sebier's most challenging and revealing portraits.\\"K√§sebier seated the Indians one by one in her posing chair, and treated the Sioux performers as friends.

K√§sebier's photographs are preserved at the National Museum of American History's Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution.Delaney, \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude K√§sebier\\", Smithsonian National Museum of American History (2007), cover page. Chief Iron Tail K√§sebier's session with Chief Iron Tail was her only recorded story: \\"Preparing for their visit to K√§sebier‚Äôs photography studio, the Sioux at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Camp met to distribute their finest clothing and accessories to those chosen to be photographed.\\" K√§sebier admired their efforts, but desired to, in her own words, photograph a \\"real raw Indian, the kind I used to see when I was a child\\", referring to her early years in Colorado and on the Great Plains. K√§sebier selected one Indian, Chief Iron Tail, to approach for a photograph without regalia. He did not object. The resulting photograph was exactly what K√§sebier had envisioned: a relaxed, intimate, quiet, and beautiful portrait of the man, devoid of decoration and finery, presenting himself to her and the camera without barriers. Several days later, Chief Iron Tail was given the photograph and he immediately tore it up, stating that it was too dark.Delaney, 2007 p.16 K√§sebier re- photographed him, this time in his full feather headdress, much to his satisfaction. Chief Iron Tail was an international celebrity. He appeared with his fine regalia as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, France, and the Colosseum of Rome. Chief Iron Tail was a superb showman and chaffed at the photo of him relaxed, but K√§sebier chose it as the frontispiece for a 1901 Everybody‚Äôs Magazine article. Chief Flying Hawk Chief Flying Hawk, Gertrude Kasebier, 1898, U.S. Library of Congress Chief Flying Hawk's glare is the most startling of K√§sebier's portraits. Other Indians were able to relax, smile or do a \\"noble pose.\\" Chief Flying Hawk was a combatant in nearly all of the fights with United States troops during the Great Sioux War of 1876. Chief Flying Hawk fought along with his cousin Crazy Horse and his brothers Kicking Bear and Black Fox II in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, and was present at the death of Crazy Horse in 1877 and the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890. In 1898, Chief Flying Hawk was new to show business and unable to hide his anger and frustration imitating battle scenes from the Great Plains Wars for Buffalo Bill's Wild West to escape the constraints and poverty of the Indian reservation. Soon, though, Chief Flying Hawk learned to appreciate the benefits of a Show Indian with Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Chief Flying Hawk regularly circulated show grounds in full regalia and sold his \\"cast card\\" picture postcards for a penny to promote the show and supplement his meager income. After Chief Iron Tail's death on May 28, 1916, Chief Flying Hawk was chosen as successor by all of the braves of Buffalo Bill's Wild West and led the gala processions as the head Chief of the Indians.Chief Flying Hawk replaces Chief Iron Tail who was stricken and died a fortnight ago. He was chosen by all of the braves yesterday. Boston Globe, June 12, 1916.Chief Iron Tail, Sint√© Maz√°  Notable Performers = Chief Iron Tail  Iron Tail was an Oglala Lakota Chief and a star performer with Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Iron Tail was one of the most famous Native American celebrities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and a popular subject for professional photographers who circulated his image across the continents. Iron Tail is notable in American history for his distinctive profile on the Buffalo nickel or Indian Head nickel of 1913 to 1938. Chief Iron Tail was an international personality and appeared as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, France and the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. In France, as in England, Buffalo Bill and Iron Tail were feted by the aristocracy.\\"Chief Iron Tail and his Sioux braves, squaws, and papooses, will sail on the French liner La Gascogne this morning for Havre, and will be met at Versailles by Jacob White Eyes, Buffalo Bill's chief interpreter, who married a French girl and is able to scramble on all fours through the French language. Col. Cody himself accompanied the party from the town of his name to Chicago. He will arrive here this morning and see that Iron Tail and his party sail.\\" New York Times, February 8, 1906. Iron Tail was one of Buffalo Bill's best friends and they hunted elk and bighorn together on annual trips.\\"He is the finest man I know, bar none.\\" M.I. McCreight, \\"Puffs from the Peace Pipe\\", p.10. On one of his visits to The Wigwam of Major Israel McCreight in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, Buffalo Bill asked Iron Tail to illustrate in pantomime how he played and won a game of poker with U. S. army officials during a Treaty Council in the old days. \\"Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose from the table and strutted away. It was a piece of superb acting, and exceedingly funny.\\" Iron Tail continued to travel with Buffalo Bill until 1913, and then the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West until his death in 1916. Chief Blue HorseTravels with Buffalo Bill= Chief Blue Horse was one of the first Oglala Lakota to join Buffalo Bill's Wild West, and accompanied Buffalo Bill on the show's first international trip to London, England, on March 31, 1887. Buffalo Bill's Wild West was part of the celebration during the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in London, England, and toured through Birmingham, Salford, and London for five months. The London Courier reported Chief Blue Horse and companions were treated to an evening of English hospitality:In 1888, Buffalo Bill had a Dinner Party in New York City. \\"The Hon. Wm. F. Cody, or as he is more familiarly known, ‚ÄòBuffalo Bill‚Äô, gave a watapee at the 'Wild West' camp yesterday. The affair was graced by a distinguished party of ladies and gentlemen. To watapee is Sioux for 'good eat.' Chief Blue Horse was in attendance. A feature of the repast was rib-roast, and the menu included besides, roast corn, pickles and pumpkin pie.\\"\\"Account of a Dinner Party for Buffalo Bill\\", The Daily Northwestern, June 20, 1888, p.2. Buffalo Bill's Wild West returned to Europe in 1889‚Äì1890 and performed in England, France, Italy, and Germany. Chief Blue Horse traveled with Wild West shows from 1886 and beyond 1904. =Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904= The Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, informally known as the \\"St. Louis World's Fair\\", was an international exposition held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States in 1904. Chief Blue Horse joined Colonel Cummins' Wild West Indian Congress and Rough Riders of the World and made public appearances at the Exposition. On January 28, 1904, Chief Blue Horse requested employment as a Show Indian for the St. Louis World‚Äôs Fair. Initially, S.M. McCowan of the Department of Anthropology replied to Chief Blue Horse that he had no use for him and that it was not the purpose of the government to expend money bringing large numbers of old Indians to the fair. McCowan discouraged Indians he did not consider educated from speaking or attending the Congress of Indian Educators and distanced himself from anyone who worked in Wild West shows. However, McCowan eventually made exceptions to the best-known Native American orators at the St. Louis World's Fair, Chief Blue Horse and Chief Red Cloud, Oglala Lakota, both eighty-three years old, and who were also asked to speak at the 1904 Congress of Indian Educators. Their interpreter was Henry Standing Soldier, an educated man who had been a participant in the 1901 Pan American Exposition Wild West Show. Anthropologists lectured, and educated Indians held congresses, while Indian students staged band concerts, dance exhibitions, dramatic presentations and marched in parades.Nancy J. Parezo, Don D. Fowler, \\"Anthropology goes to the fair: the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition\\", (2007) at p. 354,459. =An indignation meeting= On June 18, 1904, there was an incident when cowboys in the Colonel Cummins' Wild West Indian Congress and Rough Riders of the World snapped their revolvers in the faces of the Indians as an act of disrespect. \\"An ‚Äòindignation meeting‚Äô was held by 750 Indians presided over by Chief Blue Horse and Chief Geronimo, and they notified the management that if problems were not addressed vengeance would be handed out.\\" By September 1904, relations between the Indians and the Cummins' show had much improved.

From 1925 onwards he gradually abandoned his musical activity and turned on to painting. His work initially focused in depictions of the people and customs of the Huarpes indigenous population. After 1936, he fully devoted his work to Andes Andes mountains landscapes, aiming to produce a whole pictoric sequence of the Crossing of the Andes, the military campaign of General Jose de San Martin to expel the Spanish royalists from Chile in 1818. He was co-founder of the Orchestral Society of Mendoza in 1922, and of the Academia Provincial de Bellas Artes of Mendoza in 1925.

Early life Willi Gabriel was one of twins born on 31 December 1893 in Bromberg, the German Empire (present day Poland). Gabriel built his own airplanes prior to World War I. World War I service He was called up for military service when the war began. Early in 1915, he began a series of assignments to artillery cooperation units, often in company with his twin brother Walter. The twins served together until Walter was shot down and captured on 19 August 1917. Willi Gabriel was eventually stationed in Schutzstaffel 15, where he and his observer shot down a Spad on 22 March 1918. Wilhelm Reinhard then requested Gabriel's assignment to Jagdgruppe 1, and Gabriel was posted to Jagdstaffel 11 on 15 April as a fighter pilot. He scored on 19 May, then six times in June, including two observation balloons. Hermann G√∂ring then came to command JG 1, much to Gabriel's displeasure.

History Benjamin Brown Kirkland, a prominent local businessman, started the Kirkland Distributing Company in 1900 and incorporated it in 1908. He built his warehouse in 1916 on the site that farmers had used as a campground when visiting Columbia to sell their products on nearby Assembly Street. They chose the campsite because of three natural springs there, and one spring still flows in the basement of the building today. The exterior of the building is made of brick, with inset marble decorations and arched windows. Each of the three floors of the building is by , with ceilings. The natural spring rises in the northwest corner of the full basement and promptly runs down a drain. Kirkland sold a variety of products, including flour, grain and hay. In 1918, Kirkland Distributing lost a case in appellate court to the Aunt Jemima Mills Company. Kirkland's trademark of an African-American boy holding a watermelon under his chin was ruled to infringe upon the trademarked image of Aunt Jemima with her red and black shawl tied beneath her neck. In 1966 the building became the home of the Hinson Feed and Seed Company. Hinson closed his business in 1995. By the 1990s the district of old warehouses and textile mills abutting Gervais Street was recast as the Congaree Vista, and trendy business, bars and restaurants began to move into renovated buildings.

The films also stars Joe Regalbuto as Michael's dad, Wendy Phillips as his mother, Robyn Lively as his older sister, and John Vernon as the Principal.New York Times It was produced by The Samuel Goldwyn Company in association with Walt Disney Television. Plot In a world where 12-year-old Michael Gerber has no friends, he finds that sometimes, the best friendships come from within. Michael is an awkward young boy who is about to start junior high and has no real friends. His family life is in turmoil, as his father and mother are constantly fighting. His only companion is an imaginary friend he calls Fuzzbucket. In the first act of the film, both the viewer and every character except Michael is left to make the assumption that Fuzzbucket is an imaginary friend. When Michael cooks up a strange, green concoction for his friend to drink, Fuzzbucket turns visible again. Astonished to see Fuzzbucket for the first time, young Michael becomes overjoyed. His newly visible friend exuberantly leaps around Michael's treehouse in celebration. The two friends share a heartfelt moment in his treehouse when Fuzzbucket traces their hands with crayons, a ceremony that makes them blood brothers. At Fuzzbucket's urgent request for \\"Toons! Toons!\\" Michael switches on his television and the two sit together watching classic cartoons, and they soon drift off to sleep. Hours later, Fuzzbucket awakens and insists on knowing the time. He urgently cries to Michael, \\"How many clocks? How many clocks!?\\" Fearing that if he doesn't make it back home in time he will turn invisible again, only this time it will be forever. Fuzzbucket leaps out of the treehouse and escapes into the woods. Michael, afraid of losing his one and only friend, takes off after him. Fuzzbucket repeatedly tries to distance himself from Michael while trying to get back to an underground lair full of other rat-like creature similar to Fuzzbucket. At one point, Fuzzbucket is found in a dumpster with a rat eating his tail. Michael picks up a can and throws it at the rat, knocking it off of his friend's tail. Fuzzbucket thanks Michael for \\"saving his life,\\" taking his hand, kissing it, and making a strange slurping sound. He runs off and Michael gives chase. Michael tracks the creature into the woods and falls into his lair. He arrives in a chamber where Fuzzbucket creatures scatter in fright. The actual Fuzzbucket shows up and tell's Michael that since he helped him, Fuzzbucket will help him also. Michael is found by a search party underneath a tree shortly after. They all return home, where his mother and father find gifts in their room left behind by Fuzzbucket. The father opens up a novelty sized Hershey's kiss, while the mother opens up a music box. They set their gifts aside and share an intimate moment, when the camera pans to show Fuzzbucket sneaking away from the house. Characters Fuzzbucket is a hairy creature that lives in the swamps of Dead Man's Marsh with many other fuzzbuckets. The character is called \\"Fuzzbucket\\" by Michael, but also is a fuzzbucket. It is not explained whether all fuzzbuckets have different names. Michael Gerber is a 12-year-old boy and main character of the film. He is dealing with his first day of junior high and fitting in. Everyone in the film finds him odd or weird due to the fact they always think he is talking to himself, when he is in fact talking to Fuzzbucket.

Its original French language title is Des hommes et des dieux, which means \\"Of Men and of Gods\\" and refers to a verse from the Bible shown at the beginning of the film. It centers on the monastery of Tibhirine, where nine Trappist monks lived in harmony with the largely Muslim population of Algeria, until seven of them were kidnapped and assassinated in 1996 during the Algerian Civil War. Largely a tale of a peaceful situation between local Christians and Muslims before becoming a lethal one due to external forces, the screenplay focuses on the preceding chain of events in decay of government, expansion of terrorism, and the monks' confrontation with both the terrorists and the government authorities that led up to their deaths. Principal photography took place at an abandoned monastery in Azrou, Morocco. The film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix, the festival's second most prestigious award. It became a critical and commercial success in its domestic market, and won both the Lumi√®res Award and C√©sar Award for Best Film. Plot The film opens with a quotation from the Book of Psalms: \\"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.\\" (Psalm 82:6‚Äì7) The monks' peaceful routine of prayer, medical assistance, and community interaction is soon interrupted by the threat of an Islamic fundamentalist group. When their elected leader, Christian (Lambert Wilson), declines the protection of the corrupt civil authority, the monks divide amongst themselves on the question of whether to stay or flee Algeria. Before a decision is reached, a group of fundamentalists, led by Ali Fayattia, enters the monks' compound in force on Christmas Eve and demands their doctor and his medical supplies. Christian refuses their requests and cites the Quran as proof of the monks' goodwill. With a mixture of surprise and respect, Fayattia leaves the compound and grants it his protection until his capture, torture and death at the hands of government forces. Despite the growing danger, the monks come to consensus on the moral importance of maintaining their committed lives with, and ministry to, the local population, even when faced with violence and death. Ultimately, the terrorists seize most of the monks during a nighttime raid and hold them hostage. As the captive monks trudge a snowy path towards a grim fate, the film concludes with the spiritual testament of Prior Christian de Cherg√©, bravely written in the face of death.

The Armed Islamic Group of Algeria claimed full responsibility for the incident. However, according to documents from French secret services, it is possible that the killings were a mistake carried out by the Algerian army during a rescue attempt. A scholarly book on the events was published in 2002, John W. Kiser's The Monks of Tibhirine: Faith, Love, and Terror in Algeria.John W. Kiser, The Monks of Tibhirine: Faith, Love, and Terror in Algeria, St. Martin's Press 2002, The film project was initiated by Etienne Comar in 2006, when the tenth anniversary of the incident made it a topic again in French media. Comar, a film producer by profession and a Catholic, had been fascinated by the monks since the earliest news of the abduction, but felt that their death had overshadowed what he thought was really interesting: why they had decided to stay in Algeria despite the ongoing Algerian Civil War. Comar contacted Xavier Beauvois in 2008 after having written a draft, and together they continued to work on the screenplay. The two researched, met with theologians, and during a break Beauvois chose to live for six days at the Tami√© Abbey in Savoie. Some inspiration was taken from writings by two of the Tibhirine monks, Christian de Cherg√© and Christophe Lebreton. Franco-American monastic consultant Henry Quinson was asked to correct and add historical and liturgical content for further authenticity. The script was later sent to relatives of the deceased monks, most of whom reacted positively to the project. The financing coincided with the revelation of the Algerian army's possible involvement in the incident, which once again sparked an interest for the story from media and the public. Production was led by Why Not Productions with Armada Films and France 3 as co-producers. Financial support was granted by the CNC. The budget was ‚Ç¨4 million euro. As preparation for their roles, Fran√ßois Polgar, the former assistant director of the choir of the Paris Opera, former director of Le Ch≈ìur de Radio France and director of The Paris Boys Choir, trained for a month the actors who were to play monks in the Cistercian and Gregorian chants. Each actor also spent a week living as a monk at the Tami√© Abbey. The actors used different approaches to their individual roles. Lambert Wilson primarily used Christian de Cherg√©'s writings to develop a subjective perception of the monk's personality. Xavier Maly, a non-Catholic, prepared himself by praying every day for a month. Jean-Marie Frin based his interpretation partially on a home video from Paul Favre-Miville's vow. Michael Lonsdale on the other hand preferred to rely on instinct, and did not prepare much at all. Filming started in early December 2009 in Meknes, Morocco, and ended two months later. The main filming location was the Benedictine monastery of Toumliline, which had stood unused and unattended for more than 40 years. The film team, under production designer Michel Barth√©l√©my, renovated the monastery so it would resemble the location of the actual events. Quinson who had assisted with the screenplay was also present on the set as an advisor. Attention was paid to extras' clothing and Arabic intonation so that they would look and sound Algerian and not Moroccan. Release The film's cast and crew on the red carpet for the world premiere in Cannes The film premiered on 18 May 2010 in competition at the 63rd Cannes Film Festival. It was the second time a film directed by Beauvois was selected for the festival; he had previously won the 1995 Jury Prize for Don't Forget You're Going to Die. Of Gods and Men was released in France on 8 September through Mars Distribution. It was launched on 252 screens, which after two weeks had been increased to 424, and further during the third week to 442. Artificial Eye released it in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2010. Sony Pictures Classics acquired the distribution rights for the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Reception=Critical response , the film holds a 92% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 119 reviews with an average rating of 8.07 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Patient and restrained, Of Gods and Men asks deep, profound questions that will linger in the audience's mind long after the movie.\\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted score of 86/100, based on 29 reviews, which it ranks as \\"universal acclaim\\". Le Monde's Isabelle Regnier wrote: \\"We can, we must, even, consider this film as a profession of faith. But it is in the cinema where Beauvois always has placed his own, and where he places it here more than ever. Confident in the talent of his cinematographer, Caroline Champetier, ... he signs a powerful and stripped mise en sc√®ne[.] ... Relying on the arid majesty of the Atlas' landscapes (Moroccan for the filming), the milky purity of monks' robes, the rhythm of the ritual, Xavier Beauvois plays with the tracking shots with a breathtaking mastery\\". Didier P√©ron of the left-wing newspaper Lib√©ration was positive overall, but remarked: \\"Of Gods and Men would no doubt have lost in grandeur and lyricism ... what it would have gained in political content if it had specifically questioned the place of the monks and the profound role of their unctuous paternalism versus a failing state and among a deprived population.\\" In the United Kingdom, Tom Dawson of Total Film gave the film four stars out of five, and Tim Robey rated it three out of five in The Daily Telegraph. Both critics praised the performances of Wilson and Lonsdale. Dawson called the film a \\"masterful drama\\", and Robey wrote: \\"It's a grave and thoughtful film, and certainly not a bad one, for all my twinges of scepticism about how deep its insights really go.\\" Robey's main complaint concerned the ending of the film: \\"There's one serious mistake, in a picture that's almost passive-aggressively careful in most of its scenes: a last supper, while the monks sip wine, look at each other in silent, welling close-ups, and Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake overture crescendoes over the top. Those last three words are operative ‚Äì Beauvois could hardly milk this emotional catharsis more coercively if he came down the aisles handing out tissues.\\" Dawson on the other hand approved of the scene's manner: \\"The Last Supper-style sequence, where the monks listen to Swan Lake and share red wine, is particularly affecting.\\" Radio critic Mark Kermode gave an extremely positive review of the film, later ranking it as the 2nd best film of 2010. Box office 362,671 tickets were sold during the first five days of the French theatrical run. This can be compared to the director's last film, The Young Lieutenant, which had 197,783 admissions after the same number of days in 2005. Of Gods and Men went on to top the French box office for four consecutive weeks. After the fifth week it dropped to number three, having been overtaken by Despicable Me and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, which both premiered that week.

Oxley and Social Services for Blacks in North Carolina's Appalachian Counties\\", March 1990, Paper presented at the Appalachian Studies Conference (Helen, GA, March 23‚Äì25, 1990), accessed 19 Nov 2010 During this period, Oxley also taught for a few years as an instructor at St. Augustine's College, a historically black college (HBCU) in the capital of Raleigh, North Carolina. Oxley used his affiliation with the Bishop Tuttle School of School Work to build collaboration between the College and the Division of Work. He supported the education of black social workers and helped them find positions in state and local governments. (Branch, 1992) By 1934, when Oxley left the state for federal service, African-American social workers were in public agencies in 40 counties. In 1934, Oxley was appointed to the US Department of Labor, one of 45 prominent black community leaders selected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration for positions in the federal government in Washington, DC. In addition to working on programs in their respective areas in executive agencies, the appointees served as unofficial advisers to the president on issues dealing New Deal programs and their impact on African- American communities during the Great Depression. Oxley worked on programs to improve employment opportunities for African Americans. In 1937, he published \\"Government Employment and Negro Youth\\", an article encouraging use of the U.S. Employment Services opportunities. By publishing in a widely read journal, Oxley used an existing network to distribute information about government programs. Oxley continued to serve with the federal government until 1957, acting as an advocate for the elderly.N. Yolanda Burwell, \\"Lawrence A. Oxley\\", African American Pioneers, Association of Baccalaureate Program Directors, BPD Update Online, Vol. 25 No. 3, Fall 2003, accessed 19 Nov 2010 His work was an example of combining scholarship and practice. While leading efforts in state and federal government to change approaches to welfare, he published articles and reports about issues in the black community. He was a pioneer in social work and state government's providing social welfare. He was considered \\"one of the most influential state welfare leaders of his time\\".

Modeled on the Pacific Northwest Library Association, MPLA brings together librarians and those involved in libraries from across the Mountain Plains region. The MPLA region can be characterized as sparsely peopled, with densely populated urban areas widely separated from one another, often divided by vast areas of prairie grassland or mountain ranges. Librarians serving the area share challenges related to the geographical realities of the region (Kraenzel, C.F. 1948). History Founded at a meeting in Estes Park, Colorado, by librarians from Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas and Wyoming, the Mountain Plains Library Association was designed to facilitate regional American Library Association meetings. Within three days a temporary constitution had been drafted, Ralph T. Esterquist was elected president and Ruth V. Tyler was elected vice-president/president-elect. Thus, on 31 August 1948, the Mountain Plains Library Association was born (Hall, B. 1998). Membership MPLA membership is open to librarians, library paraprofessionals and friends of libraries. Individuals and institutional memberships are available. Activities and the majority of members fall within the twelve-state member region, but individual members can hail from anywhere. Governing structure The MPLA is governed by an elected board of representatives from each member state and a number of sections and roundtables representing interests and types of libraries. Officers making up the executive board are the current president, vice-president/president-elect, past president, and a recording secretary. In addition to its board and its officers, MPLA activities are carried out by committees and an executive secretary. Activities MPLA provides education opportunities in the form of meetings and workshops, provides professional development grants to members, and, since 2001, has held a Leadership Institute for up to 30 participants. Annual conferences have included a scholarly research forum since the early 1950s. The association has sponsored publications focusing on inter-library cooperation, literacy and the humanities, librarianship and technology in the Mountain Plains region (Hodgson, J. G. 1954). Awards Awards are presented at each annual conference: * The Carl Gaumer Library Champion Award recognizes an individual, organization or company showing close support of the Mountain Plains Library Association. * The MPLA Distinguished Service Award recognizes an MPLA member who has made notable contributions to the library profession or has furthered significant development of libraries in the Mountain Plains region. In the case of retired individuals, the nominee may be a past member of MPLA. * The MPLA Literary Contribution Award is presented to an author whose published writings have furthered an appreciation of the Mountain Plains region. The author need not reside in the region. Published works are evaluated on the basis of literary worth, readability, and evidence of responsible research. * The MPLA Beginning Professional Award recognizes an MPLA member who, as a librarian/media specialist within the first five years after receiving a library/media master's degree, has made a positive impact on the quality and role of library service. Factors such as innovative programming and planning, use of resources and special projects are considered. * The MPLA Unsung Hero Award is presented to any library individual or group in the MPLA region who have worked on a special project that has some significance to a community but which has not been eligible for a library award. Conferences The MPLA meets annually in joint conferences with member states on a rotational basis.

The story takes place between 1945 and 1962, and focuses on the lives of three Algerian brothers in France, set against the backdrop of the Algerian independence movement and the Algerian War. It is a stand-alone follow-up to Bouchareb's 2006 film Days of Glory, which was set during World War II. Outside the Law was a French majority production with co-producers in Algeria, Tunisia and Belgium. A historically unorthodox portrayal of the 1945 S√©tif massacre sparked a political controversy in France. Reviews of the film compared it to Westerns and gangster films, and critics observed how the independence activists were likened to the French Resistance during World War II. Outside the Law represented Algeria at the 83rd Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.

Bouchareb said, \\"You can't help but associate them, because it's the same soldiers who fought for France against Germany, a lot of them were the same soldiers that later went on to fight France. So, historically speaking, the same group of people had a lot going on early in their lives. When I was interviewing people for Days of Glory, a lot of the people I was talking to were also telling me what happened after, which is how I came to write the other movie.\\" Bouchareb researched the subject for nine months, primarily by interviewing people. Finishing the screenplay took two years. Jamel Debbouze at the Cannes Film Festival for the premiere of the film The film was written with actors Jamel Debbouze, Roschdy Zem and Sami Bouajila in mind from the beginning. Debbouze described his role's place as the youngest brother, and stronger ties to the family, as a key for approaching the character. Zem's character was inspired by the character played by Sterling Hayden in The Asphalt Jungle. Zem said, \\"When I saw the movie, it was obvious what Rachid was looking for: a combination of brute force and restraint.\\" Bouajila said about developing his character, \\"I tried to work out how, through his convictions or pride, a man can fall into the trap of his own charisma and drag other people with him. When everything spirals out of his control, he has to face himself and realizes that he is only a man.\\" The 19.5 million euro production was led by France's Tessalit Productions in co-production with France 2, France 3 and companies in Algeria, Tunisia and Belgium. Funding was granted by the National Center of Cinematography and via pre-sales to Canal+. Out of the total investment, 59% came from France, 21% Algeria, 10% Tunisia and 10% Belgium. Filming began at the end of July 2009 and lasted five months. Approximately 90% of the film was shot in the studio. The team moved between facilities and locations in Paris, Algeria, Tunisia, the Belgian cities Charleroi and Brussels, Germany and the United States, with scenes set at the United Nations Headquarters. Reception The film premiered on 21 May 2010, in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. French distribution was handled by StudioCanal and the premiere took place on 22 September 2010. It was released in Algeria on 6 October of the same year. In the United States, the film was distributed through Cohen Media Group, which released it in New York on 3 November, Los Angeles on 10 November and in a limited run throughout the country on 26 November. Critical response Outside the Law has an approval rating of 76% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 41 reviews, and an average rating of 6.46/10. It also has a score of 59 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/outside-the-law Fran√ßois-Guillaume Lorrain of Le Point compared the film's narrative to film noir and Western films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Lorrain argued that the form resulted in exaggeration and clumsiness, which burdened the film, and evoked questions about the balance between cinema as a conveyor of truth and cinema as light entertainment. Lorrain noted that, with a couple of exceptions, \\"the French have the villainous role ... with a comparison that risks to make teeth grind: the French are likened to the Germans when the Algerians endorse the costumes of resistance members. Difficult to leave Outside the Law without a feeling of guilt, already caused with Days of Glory by Bouchareb, who, by filming the opposite Maghrebin side, presses where it hurts in the official history of France. At the same time, he doesn't provide a rosy picture of the FLN, far from that.\\"Lorrain (2010) \\"les Fran√ßais ont le mauvais r√¥le ... avec une comparaison qui risque de faire grincer des dents : les Fran√ßais sont assimil√©s aux Allemands quand les Alg√©riens endossent les habits des r√©sistants. Difficile de ne pas sortir de Hors-la-loi avec un sentiment de culpabilit√©, provoqu√© d√©j√† par Indig√®nes de Bouchareb, qui, en filmant le contrechamp maghr√©bin, appuyait l√† o√π cela fait mal dans l'histoire officielle de la France. Dans le m√™me temps, il n'offre pas un tableau idyllique du FLN, loin de l√†.\\" Le Monde's Thomas Sotinel criticised the film for using stereotypes, and how too much artifice in the narrative \\"stifles the efforts of the actors,\\" concluding that \\"Outside the Law collapses under the weight of the spectacle.\\"Sotinel (2010) \\"√©touffent les efforts des acteurs\\", \\"Hors-la- loi s'effondre sous le poids du spectacle.\\" Regarding the controversies, Fay√ßal M√©taoui, who reviewed the film for the Algerian newspaper El Watan, wrote, \\"Some French critics believed they saw 'an unacceptable parallel' between the struggle against the hideous Nazi regime and the French colonial presence in Algeria. This does not seem to be the intention of Outside the Law, as the aim was to show that France hadn't held a certain promise to the Algerians ... The film, which is perfect on the aesthetical level and far from a turkey, may be entered in the anti-colonial register but not anti- French.\\"M√©taoui (2010) \\"Certains critiques fran√ßais ont cru d√©celer ¬´ un parall√®le inacceptable ¬ª entre la lutte contre le r√©gime hideux du nazisme et la pr√©sence coloniale fran√ßaise en Alg√©rie. Cela ne semble pas √™tre le cas de l'intention de ¬´ Hors la loi ¬ª puisque le but √©tait de montrer que la France n'avait pas tenu une certaine promesse faite aux alg√©riens. ... Le film, parfait sur le plan esth√©tique et qui est loin d'√™tre un navet, peut √™tre inscrit dans le registre anti-colonialiste mais pas anti fran√ßais.\\" M√©taoui also complimented that Bouchareb had chosen to portray the violent clashes between the Algerian National Movement and the National Liberation Front, an episode \\"the official Algerian history has completely ignored\\".M√©taoui (2010) \\"L'histoire officielle alg√©rienne a compl√®tement ignor√© l'√©pisode\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer published a review by Carrie Rickey, who wrote, \\"Under the obvious influence of Francis Ford Coppola, Bouchareb frames his shadow- ridden guerrilla heroes as the Algerian counterparts of the Corleones\\", referring to the American film The Godfather, and further that Outside the Law owes \\"an enormous debt to Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows (1969), about French resistance fighters one-minded in their goal to subvert Nazis\\". Rickey wrote, \\"Bouchareb is sometimes a little too one-minded: His movie might have been richer emotionally had he written scenes showing the characters' domestic lives and not strictly their professional spheres.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Outside the Law a \\"didactic, unashamedly manipulative film\\", and also saw parallels to The Godfather and Army of Shadows: \\"Those are mighty shoes to fill, and as powerful and well-made as it is, Outside the Law is too schematic and single-minded to lodge itself in your mind as a fully realized cinematic epic. Its few female characters are sketchy at best.\\" Political reactions Before the film premiered, already it was met by political controversy and nationalist-oriented criticism in France. Lionnel Luca, a member of the National Assembly for the UMP, appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project. Guy Pervill√© deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth. The Defence Historical Service claimed that \\"the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study.\\"Hugues (2010) \\"les erreurs et les anachronismes sont si nombreux et si grossiers qu'ils peuvent √™tre relev√©s par tout historien. ... Les nombreuses invraisemblances pr√©sentes dans le sc√©nario montrent que la r√©daction de ce dernier n'a pas √©t√© pr√©c√©d√©e par une √©tude historique s√©rieuse.\\" The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 S√©tif massacre early in the film. The report elaborated, \\"The director wants to suggest that on May 8, 1945, Muslims in S√©tif were blindly massacred by Europeans, whereas it's the contrary that transpired[.] ... [A]ll historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans.\\" This reaction is at odds with mainstream history, which concluded that, after restoring order in the town, French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians. Before even seeing the film, Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered \\"anti-French\\".Hugues (2010) \\"ce film anti-fran√ßais\\" Mustapha Orif, one of the film's co-producers, responded to the accusations and defended the film's portrayal of the massacre. \\"Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people, witnesses and historians. From this point of view, I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality,\\" he said.Hugues (2010) \\"Rachid Bouchareb interrog√© beaucoup de gens, de t√©moins et d'historiens. De ce point de vue, je ne pense pas du tout qu'il se soit √©cart√© de la r√©alit√© historique.\\" Box office The film opened on 400 screens in France, with 195,242 admissions after one week, which equaled a fifth place on the domestic box-office chart. The number of screens was increased to 437 for the second week, but the film dropped to eighth place on the chart. When the theatrical run ended, a total of 393,335 tickets had been sold. This was considerably less than the 3,227,502 that Days of Glory attained four years earlier. As of 10 April 2011, Box Office Mojo reported that the worldwide revenues of Outside the Law corresponded to 3,298,780 US dollars. Accolades The film was nominated for Best Screenplay at the 16th Lumi√®re Awards, voted by foreign journalists who work in Paris. It was selected as one of the five nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, having been submitted by Algeria. It was the third time a film directed by Bouchared was nominated in the category, after Dust of Life in 1996 and Days of Glory in 2007. Sequel Bouchareb has stated his desire to make a third installment that would end a trilogy that started with Days of Glory and continued with Outside the Law. He hopes to be able to produce it four or five years after Outside the Law. It will be a thematical continuation of the two previous films and focus on \\"50 years of immigration\\".

In May 2010, the U.S FDA granted Fast Track designation to CDX-011 for the treatment of advanced, refractory, or resistant GPNMB-expressing breast cancer. Structure and mechanism The fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody glembatumumab (CR011) is linked to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It uses a valine-citrulline enzyme-cleavable linker. The linkage is stable in the bloodstream. The antibody binds to GPNMB on the cancer cells, the ADC is internalised, the linkage is broken and MMAE is released to kill the cell. In preclinical studies glembatumumab vedotin was capable of killing GPNMB expressing melanoma and breast cancer cells in vitro and inducing partial or complete regression of GPNMB-expressing tumors in mouse models.  Development  Glembatumumab vedotin was in development through April 2018 by Celldex Therapeutics, who acquired CuraGen in 2009. It was originally developed through a partnership between CuraGen and Amgen, using Xenomouse technology licensed from Abgenix and ADC technology licensed from Seattle Genetics. In 2015, Celldex announced that it had formed a cooperative research and development agreement with NCI to sponsor two clinical trials for uveal melanoma and pediatric osteosarcoma. These were both phase II clinical trials.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800024630 Clinical trials In September 2010 a Phase 2b clinical study started of glembatumumab vedotin in 120 patients with GPNMB-expressing breast cancer including those with triple negative breast cancer. , Phase I/II clinical trials of glembatumumab vedotin for the treatment of advanced melanoma and breast cancer have been completed but no official study result was posted. Preliminary results from these trials have shown that glembatumumab vedotin has some clinical activity (promotes tumor shrinkage) in both cancer types. Patients whose tumors express GPNMB respond better to glembatumumab and have longer progression-free survival than those whose tumors do not express GPNMB; in melanoma, and breast cancer. An accelerated approval Phase II clinical trial (METRIC) investigating glembatumumab vedotin versus capecitabine (2:1 with crossover allowed) has begun in November 2013, expected to enroll 300 patients with GPNMB-expressing metastatic triple negative breast cancer. Patients who have progressed after receiving anthracyclines and taxanes are eligible. Development of the ADC was discontinued in April 2018 after missing the primary endpoint of its study and failed to help women with tough-to-treat metastatic triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) stay both alive and progression-free for longer than Roche Holding AG's Xeloda (capecitabine).

Established in 1975, it contains the collections of the artist Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin (1914‚Äì1976). The art gallery was established in Mymensingh as this is where the artist spent his early days. Abedin, a pioneer of the country's modern art movement, created works of art on subject matters such as the Bengal famine of 1943 and the peoples' independence. The museum is located in the area of Shaheeb Quarter Park on the bank of the Old Bramaputra River. Each year in December, the gallery authority organizes an anniversary programme that includes a discussion on the life and work of Zainul, as well as a painting competition. While the art gallery does not issue publications, Bangladesh National Museum, which has a collection of 800 Abedin paintings, has issued posters and cards on behalf of the artist. Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala is a branch of the national museum. History Born in Mymensingh, Abedin drew pictures sitting by the Brahmaputra River. While a student at the local Mrityunjay (\\"Triumph Over Death\\") School, he won the first prize in The Bombay Chronicle art competition. Subsequently, the school's headmaster sent more of Abedin's paintings to India. Devoted to his art, the school teachers encouraged him to go to Kolkata and, in 1933, Abedin was admitted to Calcutta Government Art School. In the 1950s, Abedin began a movement of collecting neglected pieces of Bangladeshi arts works that were scattered all over rural areas of the country. The artist remained attached to his hometown, prompting the establishment of a museum in Mymensingh on 15 April 1975 in a building owned by a Mr. Barden who later sold it to a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. The gallery opened with approximately 70 pieces of art that included oil paintings and drawings by Abedin during his tours abroad. The gallery was initially run by a committee that was assisted by a local administration. In its early years, it had 77 of Abedin's paintings but in 1982, seventeen pieces of art were stolen from the museum, only ten of which were retrieved in 1994. Renovations began in 1997. Two year later, the National Museum took charge of the gallery, and completed renovations in 2004 on the facility. This included construction of a main gate, ticket counters, and walls. A projector, sound system, and de-humidifier were installed. An artists' cottage and an open-air stage were added. Collection There are currently 53 oil paintings in the archive. The collection includes various themes and subjects, though most depict scenes of rural Bengal. Besides the original paintings, there are 16 replicas, and 75 photographs on Zainul's life and works. There are also 69 mementos on display such as brushes, brush holder, bottles of turpentine and linseed oil, carbon box, charcoal, wax, colour palette, colour tube, easel, ink pot, leather portrait holder, metal clip, reed pen, scraper, spatula, and his spectacles. The mementos are situated in glass boxes in the midst of the gallery. Grounds In accordance with Abedin's wishes, an art school has also been established in the museum grounds. Artists can stay at the Art Cottage which is located in a separate three-roomed building. An open-air stage is used by students on study tours and may be rented by others.

F., , Artech House, 2010. Nanonetworks are expected to expand the capabilities of single nanomachines both in terms of complexity and range of operation by allowing them to coordinate, share and fuse information. Nanonetworks enable new applications of nanotechnology in the biomedical field, environmental research, military technology and industrial and consumer goods applications. Nanoscale communication is defined in IEEE P1906.1. Communication approaches Classical communication paradigms need to be revised for the nanoscale. The two main alternatives for communication in the nanoscale are based either on electromagnetic communication or on molecular communication.

From a communication perspective, the unique properties observed in nanomaterials will decide on the specific bandwidths for emission of electromagnetic radiation, the time lag of the emission, or the magnitude of the emitted power for a given input energy, amongst others. For the time being, two main alternatives for electromagnetic communication in the nanoscale have been envisioned. First, it has been experimentally demonstrated that is possible to receive and demodulate an electromagnetic wave by means of a nanoradio, i.e., an electromechanically resonating carbon nanotube which is able to decode an amplitude or frequency modulated wave.B. Atakan and O. Akan, \\"Carbon nanotube-based nanoscale ad hoc networks,\\" IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 48 , n. 6, pp. 129‚Äì135, June 2010. Second, graphene-based nano-antennas have been analyzed as potential electromagnetic radiators in the terahertz band.J. M. Jornet and Ian F. Akyildiz, \\"Graphene- based Nano-antennas for Electromagnetic Nanocommunications in the Terahertz Band,\\" in Proc. of EUCAP 2010, Fourth European Conference on Antennas and Propagation, Barcelona, Spain, April 2010. Molecular Molecular communication is defined as the transmission and reception of information by means of molecules. The different molecular communication techniques can be classified according to the type of molecule propagation in walkaway-based, flow-based or diffusion-based communication. In walkway-based molecular communication, the molecules propagate through pre-defined pathways by using carrier substances, such as molecular motors.M. Moore, A. Enomoto, T. Nakano, R. Egashira, T. Suda, A. Kayasuga, H. Kojima, H. Sakakibara, and K. Oiwa, \\"A Design of a Molecular Communication System for Nanomachines Using Molecular Motors,\\" in Proc. Fourth Annual IEEE Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications and Workshops, March 2006 This type of molecular communication can also be achieved by using E. coli bacteria as chemotaxis.M. Gregori and Ian F. Akyildiz, \\"A New NanoNetwork Architecture using Flagellated Bacteria and Catalytic Nanomotors,\\" IEEE JSAC (Journal of Selected Areas in Communications), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 612‚Äì619, May 2010. In flow-based molecular communication, the molecules propagate through diffusion in a fluidic medium whose flow and turbulence are guided and predictable. The hormonal communication through blood streams inside the human body is an example of this type of propagation. The flow-based propagation can also be realized by using carrier entities whose motion can be constrained on the average along specific paths, despite showing a random component. A good example of this case is given by pheromonal long range molecular communications.L. Parcerisa and Ian F. Akyildiz, \\"Molecular Communication Options for Long Range Nanonetworks,\\" Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier), Vol. 53, No. 16, pp. 2753‚Äì2766, November 2009. In diffusion-based molecular communication, the molecules propagate through spontaneous diffusion in a fluidic medium. In this case, the molecules can be subject solely to the laws of diffusion or can also be affected by non-predictable turbulence present in the fluidic medium. Pheromonal communication, when pheromones are released into a fluidic medium, such as air or water, is an example of diffusion-based architecture. Other examples of this kind of transport include calcium signaling among cells,M. T. Barros. \\"Ca2+-signaling-based molecular communication systems: design and future research directions\\".

Copies of VAX-11/7xx computers are known also from Czechoslovakia (CM 5152Dujnic, J.; Fristacky, N.; Molnar, L.; Plander, I.; Rovan, B.: \\"On the history of computer science, computer engineering, and computer technology development in Slovakia\\". IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 38‚Äì48, July‚ÄìSept. In 1999), Hungary (TPA-11/540, 560 and 580The KFKI (Central Research institutes for Physics Budapest) TPA series), Romania (CORAL 8730) and the Soviet Union (CM 1700Laimutis Telksnys, Antanas Zilinskas: \\"Of computer in Lithuania\\". IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 31‚Äì37, July‚ÄìSept. In 1999). K 1840 had a maximum computing speed of 1.1 MIPS; it could access up to 16 MB of main memory and up to 4 GB of virtual memory. The first prototype with the essential core components was introduced in April 1987, and five more were built from then until September 1987. The new computer was presented to the public in October 1987. In 1988 it was awarded the National Prize of the GDR, 1st class, and a gold medal at the Leipzig spring fair. Production started in June 1988 and 217 machines were delivered at a price of 1.9 million Mark up to 1990. While the K 1840 was under development, its successor (the K 1845, based on the VAX-11/785) had already been conceived. The K 1845 was presented to the public at the Leipzig spring fair in 1990. It had a bigger main storage capacity (up to 64 MB) and could handle a bigger number of bus adaptors and controllers than its predecessor. Twenty prototypes were built. A further successor was contemplated: the K 1850, with a performance of 6 MIPS, using emitter-coupled logic (ECL) gate arrays. Robotron developed a copy of the MicroVAX II called the K 1820, which reached approximately 90% of the performance of the K 1840. The K 1820 was fully compatible with the software of the K 1840, so that already-developed system and application software could be used. In mid-1990, production of the K 1840 and K 1845 and all development work stopped, because economical production was not feasible under free-market conditions resulting from the currency, economic and social union of East and West Germany on 1 July 1990, causing the collapse of Robotron's traditional markets in the Soviet Union and East Europe.

He is best known for being the only NCAA Division I men's basketball player to be honored as his conference player of the year all four times. In 2003‚Äì04 he was part of the inaugural 11-person class inducted into the Big South Conference Hall of Fame. College career=Freshman season In 1989‚Äì90, Dunkin was forced to sit out the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers' first five games due to NCAA eligibility rules because he had just transferred from Jacksonville University. In his collegiate debut on December 9, 1989 against Georgia Tech, Dunkin, a forward, scored 22 points on 9-of-15 shooting. He scored a season-high 28 points on February 1, 1990 against Campbell en route to averages of 18.1 points and 6.6 rebounds during his rookie campaign. He led the Chanticleers to the Big South regular-season and tournament championships, garnering numerous accolades in the process. He was named the Big South Player of the Year, the first-ever Big South Rookie of the Year, First Team All-Conference and to the All-Tournament Team. Sophomore season Dunkin was named a preseason honorable mention All- American by Street & Smith's prior to the 1990‚Äì91 season. He would set new career highs in most statistical categories while helping Coastal Carolina to repeat as regular-season and conference tournament champions. In 28 games played, Dunkin averaged 18.1 points and 7.1 rebounds to become the first Big South player to win back-to-back player of the year awards. He also was named First Team All-Conference and the Tournament MVP. ;1991 NCAA Tournament The Big South was only in its sixth year of existence when Dunkin was a sophomore. As the conference tournament champion, Coastal Carolina was granted a \\"play- in\\" game in order to gain an automatic berth into the 1991 NCAA Tournament. They defeated Jackson State 78‚Äì59 and became the Big South's first-ever team in the \\"Big Dance.\\" Coastal Carolina (15th seed) would lose to Indiana (2nd seed) by a score of 69‚Äì79. Dunkin was limited to 11 points in the game. Junior season In 1991‚Äì92, Dunkin was given a second straight preseason All-American nod. Early in the season, the Chanticleers participated in the Great Alaska Shootout tournament, where Dunkin fell two points shy of setting the tournament's all-time scoring record; his 81 points is second to the record of 83. He was named to the All-Tournament Team for his performance. Due to an injury, Dunkin only played in 21 of the team's 33 games, but he led his team in scoring every game he played in and also reached the 20-point mark 15 times. For the season, he averaged 22.5 points and 8.1 rebounds, leading him to a rare third-consecutive conference player of the year selection. At the time, only 15 other Division I men's basketball players had accomplished that feat. Senior season Going into his final collegiate season in 1992‚Äì93, Dunkin was rated as the ninth-best small forward in the country by NCAA Magazine, which also tabbed him as one of the \\"Most Breathtaking Athletes\\" in college basketball. Dunkin averaged 23.7 points per game‚Äîthe highest of his career‚Äîand became the first Big South player to score 2,000 career points (his 2,151 was a record that stood for 14 years, until Larry Blair of Liberty surpassed the mark in 2007). He earned his fourth Big South Player of the Year award on March 4, 1993, making him the only Division I men's basketball player to ever earn the distinction for all four seasons. ;1993 NCAA Tournament Dunkin led Coastal Carolina to another Big South Tournament championship in 1992‚Äì93, which gave the Chanticleers their second berth into the NCAA Tournament in three years. Coastal Carolina was made the 16th seed in the West Region, which pitted them against 1-seed Michigan and its fabled \\"Fab Five\\". In a lop-sided 52‚Äì84 loss to the eventual national runners-up, Dunkin finished his career by scoring a team-high 17 points. He was invited to participate in the college Slam Dunk Contest during the Final Four Weekend activities, which made him the first Big South player in the event's history. Professional career After college, Dunkin played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for the Fargo-Moorhead Beez and in Hungary for Danone-Honv√©d BT.

The film is set in Tuscany, and focuses on a British writer and a French antiques dealer, whose relationship undergoes an odd transformation over the course of a day. The film was a French-majority production, with co-producers in Italy and Belgium. The dialogue is in French, English, and Italian. The film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, where Binoche won the Best Actress Award for her performance. Plot British writer James Miller (Shimell) is in Tuscany to give a talk to a group about his new book, titled Certified Copy, which argues that, in art, issues of authenticity are irrelevant because every reproduction is itself an original, and even the original is a copy of another form. A French antiques dealer, whose name is never given (Binoche), attends the event with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign several copies of the book she has purchased, but has to leave early because her son is hungry and becomes a distraction. She leaves her phone number with Miller's translator. Her relationship with her son is strained; he teases her about giving her phone number to Miller's translator and suggests she is romantically interested in Miller, which she denies. Miller and the woman later meet at her shop. Though she had intended for them to browse antiques together, he brusquely rebuffs this idea and suggests instead that they go for a drive, as long as they're back for his 9 p.m. train. On their aimless trip, Miller signs six copies of his book for the woman ‚Äî including a copy for her sister, Marie, in which he inscribes a note that the woman dislikes. The two debate the premise of his book, including the relationship between authenticity and simplicity. During the conversation, which at times becomes very strained, Miller points out that even the Mona Lisa is a 'copy' of the woman who modeled for the painting, real or imagined. The woman takes Miller to an art museum to see another famous 'copy,' but he is disinterested, saying that he has already finished work on the book and is not interested in further examples. The woman becomes increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son to Miller, but he attempts to rationalize her son's behavior, frustrating the woman. At his insistence, they visit a nearby caf√© for coffee. When Miller steps out to take a phone call, the caf√© owner begins speaking to the woman, mistaking Miller for her husband. Binoche's character plays along as the caf√© owner espouses the importance of marriage, no matter the flaws of one's partner. Miller returns and the woman tells him about the caf√© woman's assumption about their relationship. Once they leave the caf√©, the nature of their discussion changes, and they begin to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English (Miller states that he only learned French, not Italian, in school). They also begin to behave as though they are a married couple, referring to the woman's son as \\"our\\" son. She expresses unhappiness over their 15th wedding anniversary the previous night, during which he fell asleep while she was getting ready in the bathroom, and tells him his constant traveling for work has made him emotionally distant. During their walk through the city, they encounter an older couple and discuss their interpretations of a nearby statue. The older man pulls Miller aside and offers unsolicited \\"fatherly\\" advice: that a small gesture of affection could mend the rift between Miller and his wife. As Miller and his wife walk away, he places his hand on her shoulder; when they go into a restaurant, she goes to the bathroom and applies lipstick and puts on earrings. When she returns to the table, Miller is angry; he has clashed with the waiter over the quality of the wine. They begin to fight and Miller leaves the restaurant, though he waits for her outside. They pass by a church; she goes in without him, though she later insists this was only to take off her bra. They are entranced by and follow two elderly churchgoers, whose home turns out to be beside the hotel where Miller and his wife spent their honeymoon, though Miller does not remember the specifics of the hotel. The woman goes inside and asks to tour the room; she and Miller reminisce about their wedding night, although Miller does not remember many details. The woman appeals to Miller, saying that they should be more accepting of each other's faults, because the alternative is loneliness. He appears to rebuff her, saying he still has to catch his 9 p.m. train. Miller then goes into the bathroom and looks into the mirror; when nearby church bells begin to toll, he leaves the bathroom.

Since then they had both desired to work together and in 2008 Binoche appeared briefly in Kiarostami's experimental film Shirin. During a visit in Tehran by Binoche, Kiarostami told Binoche the synopsis of Certified Copy as a casual anecdote, which she said that she fully believed until he confessed to having made it up. According to Kiarostami, studying the reactions of Binoche as she listened to the story was a vital part of the film's further development. \\"The film started to build according to the story that I was telling, but also according to my knowledge of her as a woman with her vulnerability, with her sensitivity, with what I knew about her soul, about her relationship with her children.\\" The film suffered from several delays and changes in the cast. Filming was originally supposed to start in October 2007 with English as the principal language. A second attempt was planned for March 2008, this time mainly in French and with Sami Frey opposite Binoche. Next up to be attached was Fran√ßois Cluzet, with filming scheduled to begin in May 2009. At some point Robert De Niro was in negotiation for the role, but eventually it was offered to William Shimell, a baritone opera singer who had never acted in a film before. Kiarostami had met Shimell in 2008 during his own debut as an opera director, an adaption of Cos√¨ fan tutte for the Aix-en-Provence Festival, in which Shimell performed as Don Alfonso. \\"When I saw him, I immediately perceived in him the strength, finesse and humour of the character\\", Kiarostami commented on his choice. Production was led by MK2 in co-production with France 3 and the Italian company BiBi Films. Funding was granted by the CNC and via pre-sales to Canal+. The budget was 3.8 million euro. The film was finally shot from 8 June 2009 on location in Tuscany, using locations in Cortona, Lucignano and Arezzo. Kiarostami is normally known for making films with amateur actors and almost no budget, but said he had no difficulties in making the transition to European cinema: \\"This was the simplest film for me to work on‚Äîeven more simple than the work I've done on my shorts, because I was working with a professional team both in front of and behind the camera.\\" He also noted how he for once felt free to express whatever he wanted in the film. Release Juliette Binoche at the Cannes Film Festival for the premiere of the film. Certified Copy premiered on 18 May 2010 at the 63rd Cannes Film Festival as part of the main competition. It was released the following day in regular French cinemas through MK2. The film opened in 101 venues and had an attendance of 70,876 the first week, resulting in a ninth place on the French box office chart. After the theatrical run's second week, the number of screens had been increased to 147 and the film climbed one position on the chart, with a total attendance of 151,152. The French website AlloCin√© reported a final total of 240,797 admissions. Artificial Eye released the film in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2010. It grossed ¬£77,000 from 20 screens the opening weekend and entered the British box office chart at number 20. The Guardian reported that this was significantly better than how Kiarostami's films usually perform in the United Kingdom. IFC Films acquired the rights for American distribution and Madman for Australia and New Zealand. During the release, the film was often billed as the director's first film to be made outside his native Iran, but in reality it was only his first dramatic feature film to be shot abroad. It was preceded by the 2001 documentary ABC Africa and a segment in the 2005 anthology film Tickets. In Iran, the film was automatically banned by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Jamal Shourjeh from the ministry's Cinematic Department explained: \\"Certified Copy has been produced by a non- Iranian in Italy in western culture; therefore, it should have a license for national screening\\". Iran's deputy culture minister Javad Shamaqdari later said that the film would remain banned from general screening, citing Juliette Binoche's attire in the film as the main reason, but that it would be allowed to be shown \\"in some private circles and universities\\". But in 2011 it was made public that Certified Copy will be brought into Iranian cinemas. Reception The French reception was very positive. \\"Through strokes of chased dialogue and close-ups, Abbas Kiarostami achieves a universal film, between levity and drama, about the feelings that are diluted over time\\", wrote Renaud Baronian in Le Parisien. Baronian also liked the lead performances, finding that Shimell \\"impresses with his restraint\\" while Binoche \\"proves overwhelming\\". Nicholas Schiavi of Excessif rated the film with four stars out of five and applauded Kiarostami's craft: \\"With a formally refined technique and an incredible sense of frames within frames, the Iranian filmmaker offers a lesson in cinema. Each framework is a fixed organic tableau where the depth of field and the games of mirrors shape a sensory architecture. One can perceive the remains of the past and the possibilities of an idyll.\\" Emmanu√®le Frois of Le Figaro wrote: \\"Inspired by Roberto Rossellini, Abbas Kiarostami signs his own Journey to Italy without plagiarizing the original.\\" Frois noted how believable she found the couple with their \\"desires, disappointments, misunderstandings, hopes\\", and how the narrative alternates between drama and comedy, \\"like in life.\\" , the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes indicates that 89% of the film's American and British reviews were overall positive, based on 126 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The main stars are absolutely perfect in this absorbing, existential drama that dissects human relationships.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". In The Hollywood Reporter, Deborah Young called Certified Copy \\"a delicate, bittersweet comedy\\". Young wrote that Binoche was given \\"a chance to display her noteworthy gifts as a comedienne, switching effortlessly from English to French and Italian to build a character that is resentful, manipulative and seductive all at once\\", and that Shimell's \\"elegant cool is very close to George Sanders'\\", referring to Sanders' role in Journey to Italy. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was less impressed: \\"It is a film that is pregnant with ideas, and for aspiring to a cinema of ideas Kiarostami is to be thanked and admired. But the simple human inter-relation between the two characters is never in the smallest way convincing, and there is a translated, inert feel to the dialogue.\\" Bradshaw rated the film with two stars out of five and said that it sometimes looks like \\"the work of a highly intelligent and observant space alien who still has not quite grasped how Earthlings actually relate to each other.\\" David Denby of The New Yorker called the film \\"fascinating, beautiful, and intentionally enraging: a brilliant return to form from a director whose work, in the past, has joined modernist game-playing to ethical propriety and modesty.\\" In a review of Kiarostami's next film, Like Someone in Love, Denby further described Certified Copy as \\"nearly perverse in its ambiguity... an intricately conjoined double fiction, each tale uneasily reverberating inside its linked opposite.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times compared the film to, and suggested it has drawn inspiration from, several European films from the 1950s and early 1960s, including Journey to Italy, L'Avventura and Last Year at Marienbad, as well as several films from the 1990s and 2000s: In the Mood for Love, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Certified Copy the best film of 2011, calling it Kiarostami's strongest work. In 2020, Uhlich named it the best film of the 2010s. Binoche received the Best Actress Award at the Cannes prize ceremony on 23 May 2010. The actress used her acceptance speech to bring attention to the Iranian director Jafar Panahi. Panahi had been set to be in the festival's jury, but was held imprisoned by the Iranian regime during the event. Certified Copy was later voted the forty-sixth greatest film since 2000 in an international critics' poll conducted by BBC.

In 2005, in order to further explore sustainable design principles, she co-founded ArquitectonicaGEO (ArqGEO), a landscape architecture, master planning and urban design firm. Early life Spear was born in 1950 and has lived in Miami throughout her life. She is the eldest of three children. Her father, Harold Spear was a surgeon. In 1968 she graduated from Everglades SchoolRansom-Everglades School. Alumni Directory 1981. and in 1972 received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Brown University, where she later served as a trustee for six years. She received her Master of Architecture from Columbia University in 1975 and a Master of Landscape Architecture from Florida International University in 2006. Spear was awarded the Rome Prize in Architecture in 1978. In 1992, she was made a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. In 1999, she was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame. After years of practicing Architecture she returned to school to pursue a Master of Landscape Architecture at Florida International University which she completed in 2006. Career Spear co-founded Arquitectonica in 1977 with fellow architects Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, and Hervin Romney. In its early years, the Miami-based firm created a number of colorful, geometrically inspired structures ‚Äî including the Pink House and the Atlantis that quickly became iconic. Spear also introduced a new style of interiors into many of the Arquitectonica buildings, and this move spurred the introduction/development of her line of products for international firms such as Brayton, Wolf Gordon, and Hunter Douglas. After two decades, Spear‚Äôs interest shifted dramatically to nature and the interaction between a building and its site and context. ‚ÄúI felt there was something unconscionable about the way architecture was often ignoring the site, even thinking that it wasn‚Äôt necessary to visit. About fifteen years ago, I thought, to do it right, you‚Äôd have to be a landscape architect as well.‚Äù Returning to school, she obtained her master‚Äôs in landscape architecture and her license and founded ArqGEO in 2005. This young firm is a collaborative studio whose projects stem from a broad and deep continuum drawn from Spear‚Äôs previous body of work. The intention of blurring the line between building architecture and landscape architecture is embraced and encouraged in every project that ArqGEO undertakes. Spear works differently now than she did during the early days of Arquitectonica.‚Äù I prioritize how the building fits into the site, and I prioritize the site over the building.‚Äù GEO is a collaborative studio working on large and small projects with the main purpose of creating resilient landscapes that address our current crisis‚Äô: climate change, pandemics, the adversity and inequities faced by people of color in the United States, and around the world. Spear believes that it is incumbent upon us to rethink our role and the role of nature in this new world context and to ensure that green places are accessible to all. ‚ÄúPlanting more trees is what will make a difference.‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery project that we do in GEO is about elevating landscape ‚Äî we‚Äôre always thinking of resilience, things that will work in the years to come.‚Äù Writings Later in 2020, Spear will release a book titled, GEO BIO MIAMI designed by Irma Boom which addresses many of the topics that interest Spear: green infrastructure, climate change, storm water management, and most importantly, the quantifiable and non-quantifiable value that landscape architecture brings to a project. As Charles Birnbaum eloquently states in the introduction of the new book: ‚ÄúGEO‚Äôs work establishes ‚Äì and broadcasts- the young firm‚Äôs holistic approach to the site, and its context, by deploying an arsenal of ideas that leveraged the art and science of landscape architecture‚Äù.

The central character of the novel is Kuki, a Hindu woman from India who falls (and then rises) in love with a Muslim artist from Pakistan. The unusualness of the socio-cultural background of these two characters is delicately portrayed by Sahoo in a sensitive and convincing manner. Readers become familiar with the two sets of roles that Kuki plays; that of a lover and that of a wife. Sahoo subtly balances these two roles and at the same time, highlights the superiority of a wife in a pragmatic world. But the novel is not merely a love story. Though love is a part of the novel, it deals with a much broader topic: the providence of a woman in India. At the same time, it also portrays a story of how a perverted man, over time, becomes a perfect man. It also delves into the relationship between the 'state' and the 'individual' and comes to the conclusion that 'the state' represents the moods and wishes of a ruler and hence, 'the state' actually becomes a form of 'an individual'.

It competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. It is followed by Beyond Outrage (2012) and Outrage Coda (2017). Plot The film begins with a sumptuous banquet at the opulent estate of the Grand Yakuza leader Sekiuchi (Soichiro Kitamura), boss of the Sanno-kai, a huge organized crime syndicate controlling the entire Kanto region. He has invited the many Yakuza leaders under his control. After the formal conclusion of the banquet, Kato, the chief lieutenant of Sekiuchi, pulls one of the Yakuza leaders, Ikemoto, aside and makes plain that he is displeased with the news that Ikemoto has become friendly with a rival gang leader, Murase, while the two were unexpectedly imprisoned together. Kato, underboss of the Sanno-kai, orders Ikemoto to bring the unassociated Murase-gumi gang in line, and Ikemoto immediately passes the task on to his subordinate Otomo (Beat Takeshi), who runs his own crew. Shortly thereafter an incident occurs at a nightclub owned by Murase where a man posing as a customer is inadvertently put through a shakedown for about one million yen. It turns out that this is a member of the Otomo family who has been planted into the nightclub in order to help set-off the conditions for an all-out gang war against the Murase family. Murase, who is completely in the dark concerning his having fallen out of favor with Sekiuchi, tries to ameliorate the situation by relying on his former prison friendship with Ikemoto, not knowing that Ikemoto is under orders to terminate his gang. He accepts Ikemoto's advice several times not suspecting any ill- intentions from Ikemoto and each time he further weakens his strength, his resources and his crime family. In one incident, Otomo leaves vicious scars on the face of Kimura who is Murase's chief lieutenant. When the dust finally settles from the escalated tensions, Ikemoto and Murase are killed, Otomo is in a maximum security prison, unexpectedly with Kimura, and is stabbed twice in a prison ambush by Kimura in the belly with a makeshift knife. The complex interactions in the film finally come full circle and the film ends with Kato secretly killing Sekiuchi and taking control as the new Grand Yakuza leader of the Sanno-kai organized crime syndicate. Cast * Takeshi Kitano (Beat Takeshi) as Otomo * Kippei Shiina as Mizuno * Ryo Kase as Ishihara * Tomokazu Miura as Kato * Jun Kunimura as Ikemoto * Tetta Sugimoto as Ozawa * Takashi Tsukamoto as Iizuka * Hideo Nakano as Kimura * Renji Ishibashi as Murase * Fumiyo Kohinata as Detective Kataoka * Soichiro Kitamura as Sekiuchi * Yuka Itaya as Otomo's girlfriend * Naoko Watanabe as Mizuno's girlfriend * Eihi Shiina as Call girl * Sachiyo Tanahashi as Hostess Production Following a string of more unconventional films with limited commercial success, Takeshi Kitano decided to make Outrage as a film with no other ambition than to be entertaining. He was reluctant to label it as a return to his roots but referred to yakuza films as \\"a genre for which I have talent\\". When writing the screenplay, Kitano started by inventing the ways in which characters would be killed in the film, and thereafter wrote a story that would go along with the violence. The film was produced by Office Kitano with Bandai Visual, TV Tokyo and Omnibus Japan. Per the producer's suggestion no actors who had appeared in earlier Kitano films were cast, with the director himself as an exception. It was shot in CinemaScope from 23 August to 23 October 2009. Filming locations included Kobe and Ibaraki Prefecture. Release The film premiered in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened on 17 May 2010. The Japanese premiere followed on 12 June through a collaboration between Office Kitano and the Japanese subsidiary of Warner Bros. The film had a revenue of 1,597,856 dollars (146,363,610 yen) from 155 screens during the opening weekend, which made it the fourth highest-grossing film in Japan that week. As of 4 July 2010, Box Office Mojo reported a total revenue of 7,230,528 dollars (634,117,307 yen) in the domestic market. Reception Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine gave Outrage 3.5 out of 4 stars. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"C\\", and Kevin Jagernauth of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C-\\" rating. Rob Nelson of Variety described the film as \\"a beautifully staged marvel that confidently reasserts Kitano's considerable cinematic gifts.\\" Soundtrack Kitano returned to Keiichi Suzuki for the complete soundtrack to his film Outrage, the same Japanese composer Kitano had collaborated with for the complete soundtrack to his Zatoichi film. It was their second collaboration on a complete soundtrack for a Kitano film together.

It is a parent of several varieties from the state.  History  The original tree reportedly grew from a seed of the 'Totapuri' mango, which is also called 'Sandersha' (from Maharashtra, India) that was planted on the property of a Mr. Brooks in Miami, Florida in 1910. The Sandersha parentage of Brooks was later supported by a 2005 pedigree analysis. The tree first fruited in 1916 and propagation began in 1924. After Haden, it was the second Florida cultivar to be named. Brooks went on to gain some commercial acceptance and is still grown on some commercial scale in Florida and in Africa. It was also a parent of several Florida mangoes, including Kent, Sensation, Hatcher and probably Keitt.

Biography His early life was devoted to the trade of a carpenter, and he acquired skill as a draftsman. When twenty years old he was employed by B. H. Latrobe as his assistant engineer in erecting the first water works in Philadelphia, located in Centre Square. On 1 April 1805, he was elected superintendent and engineer of the works, but they were found to be wholly inadequate after several years of trial. John Rubens Smith, A View of Fairmount and the Water-Works, 1837 Graff Memorial In 1811 Graff recommended Fairmount as the proper place for the water works, and was entrusted with their construction. At this time, the pipes were made of wood, but Graff devised an iron-pipe system to be used instead. He brought the work to perfection, and patterns of his fire plugs and stopcocks were sent to England. In 1822, when the basic system was complete, the city water committee sent him a resolution of thanks, and he was presented with a silver vase. His experience and ability became acknowledged throughout the country, and he supplied detailed information to about 37 corporations in the United States, including New York City and Boston. By 1842, over 113 miles of water mains had been laid. He was engaged for 42 years in the service of the city of Philadelphia, and a monument to his memory was erected on the grounds of the Fairmount Water Works. In 1828 he received another from the water committee ‚Äúas a testimonial of respect for his talents and zeal effectually displayed in overcoming unforeseen difficulties encountered in the construction of the northeast reservoir at Fairmount\\". He died on April 13, 1847 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery. At his death, his son, Frederic Graff, Jr. took his place.

He played college football at Lycoming College, and then transferred to Wilkes University. He currently plays for the Arbutus Thundercats in the MIFL. High school years Urso attended Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Bethesda, Maryland. He was the starting quarterback on the varsity team from his sophomore season on. Urso lettered 3 years in football, and also excelled in other sports, lettering 3 years in basketball, and 1 season of baseball. His senior season, he was also Captain of both the football and basketball teams. In the 1995 season, Urso led B-CC to their first ever 10-0 regular season record as a junior. The team won their first ever road playoff game, defeating Milford Mill Academy, of Baltimore County, 29-14; pushing their record to 11-0. Urso led the way passing for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns of 82 and 78 yards, respectively. The following week Bethesda Chevy-Chase hosted the first ever home playoff game in the football program's 60-year history, but fell to eventual State Champion Linganore High School 24-6. In 1996 Urso finished his high school career with 3,969 yards passing, 51 touchdowns, and the Maryland Public Schools State passing record for both completions in a career and attempts in a career, while finishing second all-time (as of 1996) in passing yards and touchdowns in a career. Following his senior season Urso was named 1st team All-County, All-Gazette, All-league, and also named to the All-State and The Washington Post All-Metropolitan teams. He was also invited to play in the Chesapeake Classic All-Star game (Maryland high school all-stars vs. Virginia high school all-stars). College years In the spring of 1997 Urso signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to play football. After his freshman season, he transferred to Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. By the conclusion of his college career he had compiled 5,423 yards passing and 73 touchdowns. Professional career Out of college Urso was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New York Giants. During the preseason he was released and then signed a week later by the Seattle Seahawks. He was then released before the beginning of the 2001 season. Urso was the starting quarterback for the 2007 inaugural season of the expansion Baltimore Blackbirds of the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) coached by Head Coach Chris Simpson. Urso threw the first touchdown in team history, on the road at the Reading Express. It was a 15-yard strike to WR Kevin Dixon. In the team's first home game at 1st Mariner Arena versus the Carolina Speed, Urso accounted for every touchdown his team scored with the exception of 1 (an interception return for a touchdown by DB Milton Harris), passing for 3 touchdowns and rushing for 1 more. At the conclusion of the 2007 season the Blackbirds organization folded and the team was dissolved, making Urso a free agent. In 2008, he signed with the Chesapeake Tide of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL). Coached by Head Coach Matt Steeple, and Offensive Coordinator Chris Armstrong, he went on to lead the team in passing and rushing for the season‚Äî112-191 (58.6%), 1206 yards, and 26 touchdowns passing and rushing for 226 yards and 6 touchdowns. Other statistical leaders on the team include (WR/RB) Darryl Overton Jr., (WR) Joe Able, (WR) Ray McCarter Jr., and (DB) Jeff Overton. In the Tide's final game of the 2008 season, Urso had a career game in defeating the New Jersey Revolution, 55-47. On the day Urso went 20-24, with 276 yards passing and a team record 7 touchdown passes (3 to Darryl Overton Jr., 2 to Ray McCarter Jr., 1 to Daryl Disbrow Jr., and 1 to Sean Lipscomb). In the offseason following the 2008 season, the Chesapeake Tide organization moved to the Indoor Football League (IFL) for the 2009 season, under the name Maryland Maniacs. Urso then signed with the Maniacs for the 2009 season.

Karrikins help stimulate seed germination and plant development because they mimic a signaling hormone known as strigolactone. Strigolactones are hormones that help increase growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil, which enhances plant growth and leads to an increase in plant branching. Smoke from wildfires or bushfires has been known for a long time to stimulate the germination of seeds. In 2004, the butenolide karrikinolide (KAR1) was shown to be responsible for this effect. Later, several closely related compounds were discovered in smoke, and are collectively known as karrikins. Chemical synthesis Karrikins are formed by the heating or combustion of carbohydrates, including sugars and polysaccharides, mainly cellulose. When plant material burns, these carbohydrates convert to karrikins. The pyran moiety of karrikins is probably directly derived from a pyranose sugar. There is no evidence that karrikins occur naturally in plants, but it has been postulated that karrikin-like molecules do. Karrikin taxonomy It has long been known that compounds released from smoke stimulate seed germination. To identify the active compounds that contribute to seed germination activity, smoke compounds were separated by liquid fractionation and were each tested for their effects on seed germination activity. Bioassays identified several related compounds that were named karrikins. Six karrikins have so far been discovered in smoke, and they are designated KAR1, KAR2, KAR3, KAR4, KAR5 and KAR6. KAR1 to KAR4 are the most active karrikins. KAR1 is also known as karrikinolode and was the first karrikin to be discovered. Mode of action Karrikins are released into the air upon the burning of plants. Subsequently, karrikins then get deposited on the soil surface and stimulate seed germination after rainfall. Since karrikins are released from smoke, they are released in huge quantities. Interestingly, some plants which are known as \\"fire-followers\\" are unable to germinate without karrikins. Fire-followers need rain after massive fires in order to germinate; this means that they may remain dormant and viable for decades until the right combination of fire occur in proper succession. Etymology The first karrikin discovered, abbreviated as KAR1, was initially named gavinone in reference to its discovery by chemist Gavin Flematti. After consulting with an etymologist, Flematti proposed changing the name of the molecule and its related compounds to karrikin. One of the first recorded Western Australian Noongar words for 'smoke' from the Perth area in the 1830s, is 'karrik' .  The response to karrikins  Karrikins produced by bushfires occur largely in the ash at the site of the fire. Rains occurring after the fire wash the karrikins into the soil where dormant seeds reside. The karrikins and water can provide a 'wake- up call‚Äô for such seeds, triggering germination of the soil seed bank. The plants that depend on karrikins to grow are known as \\"fire-followers\\" , they emerge grow quickly, flower and produce new seeds, which fall to the ground. These seeds can remain in the soil for decades, until the next fire produces fresh karrikins. Plants with this lifestyle are known as fire ephemerals. They thrive because the fire removes competing vegetation and provides nutrients and light for the emerging seedlings. Plants in many families respond to smoke and karrikins, suggesting that this response has evolved independently in different groups. Fire-followers are not the only plants that respond to karrikins. Seeds from a number of different flowering families like tomatoes, lettuce, and trees respond to karrikin signaling. . Interestingly, other studies have found that seed of ostensibly fire-adapted species do not display a sensitivity to karrikins. The difference between fire-followers and plants that respond to karrikins is their dependence on karrikins. Plants' response to karrikins is fundamental because karrikins mimic the strigolactone hormones which are originally required for growth in plants. Fire-followers, on the other hand, have fine-tuned their responses according to the availability of karrikins.  Structure and physicochemical properties  Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen make up the two ring structures found in karrikins, one of which is a six-membered, heterocyclic ring with a molecular formula of C5H6O known as pyran, and the other is a five-membered lactone ring known as a butenolide. Karrikins easily dissolve in water, they are transparent, and have a melting point of 118‚Äì119 ¬∞C. However, they are unstable at very high temperatures and during common daylight, which means that they decay more rapidly than common active compounds which are not sensitive to sunlight.  Mechanism of action  The mode of action of karrikins has been largely determined using the genetic resources of Arabidopsis thaliana. Perception of karrikins by Arabidopsis requires an alpha/beta-fold hydrolase named KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE-2 (KAI2). The KAI2 protein has a catalytic triad of amino acids which is essential for activity, consistent with the hypothesis that KAI2 hydrolyses its ligand. This model is consistent with the perception of the chemically related strigolactone hormones which involves hydrolysis by their receptor protein DWARF14, an alpha/beta hydrolase related to KAI2. The question of whether karrikins act directly in plants is controversial. While some studies suggest that karrikins can bind directly to KAI2 protein, others do not support this. It is possible that karrikins produced by wildfires are converted to a different compound by the plant, before interaction with KAI2. The ability of different plants to carry out this conversion could partly explain differences in their ability to respond to karrikins and to smoke.  Signalling  The activity of karrikins requires an F-box protein named MORE AXILLARY GROWTH-2 (MAX2) in Arabidopsis. This protein is also required for strigolactone signaling in Arabidopsis. Homologs of MAX2 are also required for strigolactone signaling in rice (known as DWARF3) petunia (DAD2) and pea (RMS4). Karrikin signaling also requires a protein named SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILARY GROWTH2-1 (SMAX1) which is a homolog of the DWARF53 protein required for strigolactone signaling in rice. SMAX1 and DWARF53 proteins could be involved in the control of cellular functions such as transport or transcription. The present model for karrikin and strigolactone signaling involves interaction of KAI2 or DWARF14 with SMAX1 or DWARF53 proteins respectively, which targets those proteins for ubiquitination and destruction. Studies have shown that Arabidopsis responds to the two signals; KAR1, and KAR2. The two genes, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) and KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) are essential for understanding the actions of karrikins and were discovered in Arabidopsis mutants which failed to respond to karrikins. In rice, strigolactones interact with the F-box protein knowns as DWARF3 upon their hydrolysis by the DWARF14 (also known as D14-type proteins). This interaction targets the ubiquitination and destruction of proteins which are responsible for different aspect of plant growth, like the outgrowth of lateral shoots. This means that strigolactones, upon their interaction with D3 and D14; ubiquinate, and destroy proteins like DWARF53, which are responsible for the outgrowth of lateral shoots, and for the inhibition of stem thickening and root branching. In Arabidopsis, Karrikins work in a similar way to strigolactones; they require homologous proteins known as KARRIKIN- INSENSITIVE1 (KAI1 or MAX2) in order to be able to interact with KARRIKIN- INSENSITIVE2 which is responsible for hypocotyl elongation and the inhibition of seed germination. The ubiquination of KAI2, therefore stimulate seed germination and inhibits hypocotyl elongation. Karrikins could be used as agricultures, considering the environmental challenges that are occurring nowadays.  Effects on plant growth  Karrikins not only stimulate seed germination, but are reported to increase seedling vigour. In Arabidopsis, karrikins influence seedling photomorphogenesis, resulting in shorter hypocotyls and larger cotyledons. Such responses could provide seedlings with an advantage as they emerge into the post-fire landscape. The KAI2 protein is also required for leaf development, implying that karrikins could influence other aspects of plant growth.  Evolution  The gene for KAI2 protein is present in lower plants including algae and mosses, whereas the DWARF14 protein evolved with seed plants, probably as a result of duplication of KAI2 followed by functional specialisation. Karrikin signaling could have evolved with seed plants as a result of the divergence of KAI2 and DWARF14 functions, possibly during the Cretaceous period when fires were common on Earth.  Response to wildfires  Karrikins are produced by wildfires but all seed plants contain KAI2 proteins, raising the question of the usual function of this protein. There is compelling evidence that plants contain an endogenous compound that is perceived by KAI2 to control seed germination and plant development, but this compound is neither a karrikin nor a strigolactone.

It aired in the United States on NBC on September 24, 2009. The episode features Jeff and Pierce working on a Spanish project as Annie and Shirley organize a protest. Receiving 5.39 million viewers upon its premiere, the episode was met with mostly positive critical reception. The end tag‚Äîthe first of the series‚Äîshows Troy and Abed performing a nonsense rap in Spanish, an early interaction between the pair which was praised by reviewers.  Plot  Jeff (Joel McHale) is late to the group's study session, but everyone except Britta (Gillian Jacobs) is charmed by him as he greets each of them in turn. She fails to get Jeff to address his lack of punctuality. Later, Jeff gives Britta a card to apologize for his poor first impression two weeks prior, but Britta remains wary of him, believing him to be exploiting other members of the group. Meanwhile, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) and Annie (Alison Brie) are interested in learning about a cause Britta mentioned prior, the killing of journalists in Guatemala such as Chacata Panecos. Shirley and Annie plan a protest, but Britta is annoyed at the pair, believing them to be going about the matter poorly. The group's Spanish instructor, Ben Chang (Ken Jeong), randomly divides the students into pairs for an assignment. Jeff trades his shirt with Abed (Danny Pudi) in exchange for switching partners, but Britta has already swapped with Pierce (Chevy Chase), whom Jeff is unhappy to work with. Pierce is excited to work with Jeff, insisting on drinking scotch and socializing before they begin the assignment. As Pierce develops an increasingly complicated Spanish presentation, veering wildly off-topic into homophobic and antisemitic diatribes, and failing to use the Spanish phrases required to pass the assignment, Jeff grows angry and storms out. Meanwhile, Annie and Shirley are hosting a candlelight vigil. Initially annoyed, Britta apologizes to them and asks how she can help. Jeff arrives, trying to impress Britta. Pierce soon arrives and rants at Jeff before accidentally lighting himself on fire from a protester's candle and running into a fountain. Shirley and Annie are thrilled when they discover a newspaper article about the event, though it mostly focuses on Pierce's injuries. Though Pierce is ready to do his presentation alone, Jeff changes his mind and performs it with him. The presentation is lengthy, with multiple costume changes and a variety of props and dance sequences. Unimpressed, Chang fails the pair. An amused Britta tells Jeff that no woman present will ever see him in a sexual context in the future. End tag \\"Spanish 101\\" is the first Community episode to feature an end tag, which shows Troy and Abed performing a Spanish rap with nonsense lyrics. Their rap is referenced in later episodes, in which different characters add to or modify the rap. Creator Dan Harmon had expected Troy and Pierce to form a natural combination, but wrote Troy and Abed together in the first end tag after seeing Pudi and Glover improvise a rap on a red carpet in front of a journalist.  Reception  Upon its first broadcast in the United States, an estimated 5.39 million viewers watched the episode. The episode received positive critical reception. Bill Wyman of Slate ranked the episode ninth-best of the series' first 59 episodes (up to the mid-season break in season 3). Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A‚Äì, finding the characters amusing and praising their writing, positively reviewing how the episode develops the show from the pilot. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic praised the episode as \\"fantastic\\" and highlighted Chang as \\"hilarious\\". Jonah Krakow of IGN praised Chang's acting and the presentation delivered by Jeff and Pierce, but criticised the middle parts of the episode. Krakow criticized Annie, Shirley and Pierce as \\"one-note\\" and found Pierce's anger at Jeff to be \\"rushed and unearned\\". After the program's conclusion, Kieran McLean of Screen Rant ranked the end tag the third-best of the series. Screen Rants Mark Birrell and Uproxxs Alyssa Fikse ranked the end tag the fifth and twelfth best moments of Troy and Abed's friendship in the series, respectively. Krakow also praised the end tag.

Probably built in the late 17th century, it is one of New Haven's oldest surviving buildings, and a good example of First Period colonial architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is now owned and operated by the New Haven Museum and Historical Society, and is open seasonally for events, classes and tours. Description and history The Pardee-Morris House is located in New Haven's Morris Cove area, on the east side of New Haven Harbor. It is located at the southeast corner of Lighthouse Road and Morris Avenue. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with stone end walls and chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The stone is laid in part with mortar of great antiquity, into which shells have been mixed. The main facade is seven bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically about the main entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a modern shed-roof hood. The oldest portions of the house are believed to date to the late 17th century, probably during the lifetime of Thomas Morris, the first colonial grantee of land in this area, or one of his sons. It was partially burned by the British in 1779. It remained in the Morris family until 1915, when it was sold to William Pardee. He only briefly occupied the house, and willed it to the historical society upon his death a few years later, along with an endowment for its care. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven, Connecticut ReferencesExternal links *New Haven Museum *John Morris House, Lighthouse Road & Morris Avenue, New Haven, New Haven County, CT, at HABS Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1700 Category:Houses in New Haven, Connecticut Category:Museums in New Haven, Connecticut Category:Historic house museums in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New Haven, Connecticut Category:1700 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Morris House (New Haven, Connecticut)"},{"id":"26969173","text":"Oberleutnant Erich R√ºdiger von Wedel (1892-1954) was a German World War I flying ace credited with thirteen aerial victories.

It is a wooden building in three parts, the oldest of which dates to the mid-18th century. Some of its inhabitants have been among the prominent residents of the county, and the state. Thomas Storm, a captain in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, later served as the state Assembly Speaker. He had George Washington as a guest one night. Members of the Brinckerhoff family, longtime inhabitants of the area, lived in the house until 1930. The house is considered an excellent, well-preserved example of Dutch Colonial architecture. Its modifications and additions reflect changing tastes over the time it was within the Storm family. In 2008 it, along with several other structures on the property, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been described as \\"the most historically significant house\\" in East Fishkill because of the Washington connection. House and grounds The house is on a parcel on the north side of Beekman Road on the northeast corner of the Sylvan Lake Road junction just east of its interchange with the Taconic State Parkway, also listed on the National Register. The area is generally wooded with low-density farm and residential development. The lot is level with the house set back from the road. A small pond is located in the rear. The main building itself is a heavy timber frame structure sided in clapboard on a stone foundation. The walls are filled with wattle and daub. Three chimneys pierce the gabled roof, covered with asphalt shingles. It is divided into an east (two stories) and west (one and a half stories) section, itself with a kitchen wing on the west. A porch on the main block of the east section, supported by wooden columns gives access to the original Dutch door offset to the west. It opens into a remaining section of the original great room. It retains its original wide floor planks, exposed chestnut ceiling beams and window sashes. Rear doors lead into a modern kitchen and mud room added to the rear. To the east the cooking shed has the original fieldstone fireplace with exposed chimney and beehive oven. The Portaal to the east has a Federal style fireplace and mantel with fluted columns. To its north is a built-in shelf and closet. Original wallpaper remains on the south wall. The upper half-story is given over to bedrooms, one of which has the original flooring and a secret compartment in the floor. Three dormer windows pierce the south (front) side of the roof on the east wing. A small shed-roofed portico with shallow rounded arch supported by four wooden columns gives access to its original Dutch door, with sidelights. It opens onto a central hall with original staircase. On its east are a living room and library, both with original detailing. The library's chimney breast has original fireplace jambs, a raised hearth and stile and rail paneling. The living room's fireplace has its original Delft tiles, a shallow cornice, dentil border and torus and plain molding. The west wing's second floor has a large landing with beaded woodwork. It leads to a master bedroom and two smaller bedrooms. The entire floor has its original wideboard flooring. The roof framing uses king post trusses on the collar ties rather than the more commonly used tie beam formation, a construction visible in the master bedroom. At the extreme east and west end of the house is an old well and cistern respectively. Both are considered contributing resources to its historic character, as are the monument in front of the house, which contains an old Indian mash bowl found on the property. In the rear of the property, about to the north, are the remains of an old silo with a stone wall, also contributing resources. The garage and storage shed are non-contributing modern additions. History The property on which the house stands was originally part of the Rombout Patent, purchased by Francis Rombout and Gulian Verplanck from local Native American tribes in 1682. King James II granted letters patent three years later, allowing Rombout and the heirs of Verplanck, who had died in the interim, to subdivide and sell the land. In 1759 Derick Hageman bought containing the future house property from Catheryna Rombout Brett, a descendant of Francis who had settled in what is now Beacon. She carefully chose buyers with complementary skills and trades in order to sustain agrarian development on her family lands in the interior of the eastern Hudson Valley. He built the west wing of the house and, as a blacksmith by trade, probably forged the door hinges himself. Ten years later, in 1769, a neighbor, Garret Storm, for whom the hamlet of Stormville is named, bought the property from Hegeman and gave it to his son Thomas as a wedding gift. The younger man added the eastern section. He operated a tavern and store on the site. During the Revolutionary War, Thomas Storm served as a captain in the Continental Army, which he allowed to camp on the property. The cistern may also have been used as a prison. He stored some flour that had been confiscated by the army from a miller in Massachusetts, and wrote a letter to the Continental Congress, archived in the Library of Congress, requesting funds to reimburse the miller. George Clinton called him \\"the most honest man in Dutchess County\\". In 1778, George Washington, who had the location of the house marked on one of his pocket maps, spent a night. Locals gathered the next morning, and he came out to address them. When they removed their hats at his presence, he advised them to put them back on since he was just an ordinary man like them. After the war, Thomas Storm was elected to the New York State Assembly for two terms, and then moved to New York City. He became a successful merchant and eventually returned to the Assembly, where he served as Speaker in 1802‚Äì03, and later ran for lieutenant governor with Morgan Lewis. He sold the house in 1785 to John Adriance, a member of a prominent Dutchess County family who later lent their name to Poughkeepsie's library. Upon his death in 1794, the house was sold to George Brinckerhoff. He added the columns and other Federal style decorative touches to the house. The Brinckerhoff descendants lived in the house throughout the 19th century. In 1880, when the Portaal's flooring was replaced, a trap door to the basement was discovered. In it were a cap, knapsack and book which may have belonged to a Revolutionary-era British prisoner of war kept in the house. Also kept in the house by the Brinckerhoffs was a secretary's desk brought to the colonies by Joris Brinckerhoff in 1638. It is now in the Museum of the City of New York. T. Van Wyck Brinckerhoff, one of the four generations of that family to own the house, served as the East Fishkill town historian. He was able to locate a misplaced map of the Rombout Patent now in the New York State Library. His daughter Julia kept the house in the family until 1930. That year the state and the local Daughters of the American Revolution chapter placed a monument in front of the house, which included an old Indian millstone found on the land. It has since remained a private house. Later owners have restored it, and it has been included on historic tours of the county.

They are located in S√∂dert√§lje, Stockholm County and the province of S√∂dermanland, Sweden by the eponymous road Holmfastv√§gen. Description Detail showing the beast on the S√∂ 313 image. The right carving S√∂ 313 is purely ornamental and probably represents a wolf. The lean wolf with hanging tongue seems to quickly rush out of the picture. The carving also includes a couple of ordinary rune snakes and a braided ring cross. The depicted cross means that Holmfast's family were Christian, which is further supported by the content of the text. The style of the carvings indicate that they were made around 1050‚Äì1080 AD. They were signed by rune master √ñsten (Eysteinn in the runic text), who also signed Su 344 at Kiholm and S√∂dert√§lje Canal in V√§stert√§lje parish, and the recently discovered Bornhuvud carving on Bornhuvud at Vitsand in Salem parish. Road and bridge-building as described in the runic text is fairly common in runestones during this time period. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges in a practice similar to the use of indulgences in return for the church's intercession for the soul of the departed. pp. 490-492. Holmfast's road led from T√§lje to N√§sby, which was located on Lake M√•snaren, about three kilometres west of the carving. Where the ground was sunken, the road had to be reinforced with a bridge system in the form of stone fillings or wooden structures. Today's stretch of road still follows the original route. The Holmfast carving is created on a rock that cannot be moved, and the carving is very elaborate as it consists of two messages. Rune carvings were status symbols that would be seen by many bypasses, so it is likely that Holmfast's road was part of a larger road system. There are many indications that it was a precursor to G√∂ta landsv√§g, the oldest and most well-known road connection that went from Stockholm via S√∂dert√§lje further south towards G√∂taland. The three carvings are considered to have been made contemporaneously and all made by a runemaster with the normalized name of √ñsten (Eysteinn in the runic text), with his signature appearing on S√∂ 312. The inscriptions are known as Holmfastristningen or \\"Holmfast carvings\\" after the name of the road that passes near them. S√∂ 311 Detail showing serpent head on S√∂ 311. S√∂ 311 consists of runic text carved onto a serpent band. The inscription, which is rather damaged, is 1.2 meters in height and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also called Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond- shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. InscriptionTransliteration of the runes into Latin characters= :hulfastr + lit + braut + ru√æia + aft Ä + ik----(√æ)i + mu(√æ)-r + sina + ku-- + -r-a... + sina +Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for S√∂ 311. =Transcription into Old Norse= :Holmfastr let braut ry√∞ia √¶fti Ä Ing[i]..., mo√∞[u]r sina go[√∞a] ... sina. =Translation in english= :Holmfastr had the path cleared in memory of Ingi-... his good mother ... his. S√∂ 312 Detail showing cross and serpent head on S√∂ 312. S√∂ 312 consists of runic text carved onto a serpent band that circles a Christian cross. The inscription is 1.5 meters in height and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also classified as being an Urnes style. The text in two locations follows the rule that two consecutive identical letters are represented by a single rune, even when the two identical letters are at the end of one word and the start of a second word. This inscription uses one i-rune for the words byki i. The inscription is signed by the runemaster Eysteinn, which is normalized as √ñsten, by simply adding his name at the end of the text without using any verb such as \\"carved\\" or \\"painted.\\" Although such signatures are unusual on runestones, there is another example of an inscription being signed in this manner on S√∂ 266 in Sanda. This is the only surviving inscription known to have been signed by this runemaster, although two other Urnes style inscriptions, S√∂ 338 at Turinge and S√∂ 344 at Kiholm, have been attributed to √ñsten based upon stylistic grounds.

The flowers of a marolo look like jellyfish wearing hats, and the fruits are sweet and very rough. It is native to Brazil and Paraguay and the fruit is eaten by native peoples in the Brazilian Cerrado. Although it is considered to have potential for cultivation, it has not been domesticated to date. Description Marolo is a tree of about 6‚Äì8 m tall, with a crown diameter reaching 2‚Äì4 m, from the Annonaceae family, which occurs discontinuously in the Brazilian cerrado. The plant prefers the savannah regions with lower moisture deficit such as Minas Gerais, where the fruit is typical and very much appreciated, Mato Grosso do Sul, a small portion of the interior of S√£o Paulo and in isolated parts of Goi√°s, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranh√£o and the eastern part of Bahia. Roots, trunk and leaves Flowering buds of Annona crassiflora, Bras√≠lia. It has axial root system that reaches greater depths in the soil to absorb water and nutrients. Its trunk is straight with crooked twigs, its bark is corky, chipped and thick. It has ovate leaves, leathery, yellow-greenish flowers that occur between November and January, with entomophilous pollination, more specifically by the Cicloc√©falo beetle (Cyclocephala atricapilla). The fruits are multiple bac√°ceas infructescenses up to 4.5 kg, edible, green-brownish bark when mature, with seeds also regarded as anti-diarrheal. Fruits Araticum fruit. Its fruits reach over 15 cm in diameter and 2 kg, containing many seeds about 1.5 cm long. When opened, the fruit has a creamy pulp and very strong odor and flavor that differs greatly from custard apple. It is considered a delicacy in the Brazilian Cerrado region, sold in street markets, consumed fresh or as a Cocktail, cake, in the form of cookies, crackers, pops, ice cream, jams and many other sweets. The fruiting begins in November, maturing between February and April, where living in Minas Gerais Brazil, where it is popularly associated with the Lent season. When the fruit is ripe it falls to the ground under the protection of the crown, exuding a strong and distinctive smell. These are the best quality fruits for the consumer, because if harvested directly from the tree, the fruit will not mature, producing an inferior quality flavor. Reproductive Biology Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.Walker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1-130. Deforestation and reduction of species The increasing deforestation of the Cerrado and the delayed germination of seeds, which can reach up to three hundred days, have contributed much to the radical reduction of maroleiros in Minas Gerais. It is the remarkable scientific research work and cultivation developed by Jo√£o Afonso de Carvalho, professor at the Federal Agrotechnical School in Machado, in southern Minas Gerais, that preserves the Marolo trees region. The locations which concentrate a greater number of species of trees are Carvalh√≥polis and Paragua√ßu.

He was first nominated by General Obasanjo and appointed by President Jonathan as Minister of Finance from 6 April 2010 to June 2011. Achievements Mr. Aganga has been widely acclaimed as being responsible for many transformational milestones in Nigeria, including ‚Äì establishing the country's Sovereign Wealth Fund; issuing the Nation's first ever Euro Bond; chairing the World Bank and IMF in 2010, chairing the 8th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (MC8) in Geneva in 2011 (the first African to chair these organisations); making Nigeria the premier destination for investments in Africa, and launching the country's boldest industrialization agenda. He was also responsible for structuring and financing the first standard gauge rail (Abuja to Kaduna) in Nigeria. He is also the Chairman of Marina Express, the first private sector developer of rail in Lagos. He sits on a number of Boards including the Advisory Board of the Queens Commonwealth Trust based in the United Kingdom. Mr. Aganga remains one of the most regarded investor influencers for Nigeria, based on his extensive experience both internationally & domestically, and his track record in and out of government. Some specific milestone achievements include: 1\\\\. Complete transformation of the Federal Government of Nigerian (FGN) Ministry of Trade & Investment (MITI) into Nigeria's number 1 economic ministry. 2\\\\. Operationalised Nigeria's debt resolution vehicle, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), to improve the liquidity and bring stability into banking industry after the global economic crisis working closely with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). 3\\\\. As chair of the WTO MC8 ministerial conference, he laid the foundation for the first WTO trade agreement and also played a pivotal role in finalising the agreement in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013. This was the first multilateral trade agreement in the 13 years of the WTO. 4\\\\. Initiated several policies to diversify the Nigerian economy towards making Nigeria less import dependent and creating jobs. These policies include the auto policy, sugar policy, cotton textile, garment policy, and co- developed a new rice production policy. He fully implemented the cement policy which led to self sufficiency in cement, the end of importation of cement into Nigeria, and for the first time in Nigerian history, companies started exporting cement. 5\\\\. Recorded major milestones as the FGN Minister of Trade & Investment which include: a) Turning manufacturing into the second fastest growing sector in the Nigerian economy [Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS)] b) Mobilised strategic investment and expansions in key strategic sectors where Nigeria was previously import dependent such as (sugarcane to sugar policy), sugar, auto, Petro chemical, refinery, fertiliser and cement. c) Recorded significant growth in the number of companies in the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector from 17.2 million in 2010 to 32.4 million in 2014, and the attendant employment created by this sector also increased astronomically from 37 million in 2010 to 60 million in 2014 (NBS). d) Initiated the countries first national quality infrastructure program with UNIDO. e) Reduced business registration cost by 50% for SME's and 25% for large companies. He also established a 24-hour registration service in some commercial cities, and launched an on-line registration platform. He also introduced the visa-on-arrival policy for investors. f) During his tenure as Minister of MITI, Nigeria was rated number 1 by the World Street Journal Frontiers Market index as the most watched frontiers market in the world. g) NLI was a catalyst for Nigeria's economic vision 20:2020. Education and background Aganga was educated at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria where he obtained a B.Sc Degree in Biological Sciences in 1977 and the University of Oxford, United Kingdom where he obtained a degree in Theology in 2000. Aganga qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1983. Professional career His professional career extends over four decades, holding a number of leadership positions both within the private and public sector. Mr. Aganga was previously a Managing Director with Goldman Sachs in London, working in prime brokerage, covering Hedge Funds. Prior to this, he was a Director with Ernst & Young, London responsible for covering traditional and alternative investment firms including Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Hedge Funds. Prior to that, he was responsible for some Japanese clients and companies in a number of industries including oil and gas, automobile, insurance, FMCG and construction. Mr. Olusegun Aganga is the Founder and Chairman of 3V Partners Ltd., an asset development and investment company focused on some identified sectors of the economy including infrastructure. 3V has a presence in the UK. Within the public sector he served first as Nigeria's Minister of Finance & Chairman Economic Management Team; and then as its Minister of Industry, Trade & Investments. Leadership Initiative and Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) In 2006, Aganga founded the Nigerian Leadership Initiative. Led the establishment of Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund. Ministerial redeployment In July 2011, Aganga was redeployed by the President to the new Ministry of Trade and Investment, to make way for Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to return as the Nigerian Minister of Finance. On 9 March 2013, the Nigerian Government changed the name of the Ministry of Trade and Investment to Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. Personal life Aganga is married to Abiodun Aganga (n√©e Awobokun). He has four children. He is also the brother-in-law to the former military Governor of Kwara State Group Captain Salaudeen Latinwo. His older sister is Mercy Latinwo Controversy over Aganga's Ministerial Appointment In 2010, Aganga's ministerial nomination was resisted by the Lagos State chapter of the PDP on the basis that he was filling the Lagos State ministerial slot but had not been born in the state. In June 2011, again Aganga's ministerial nomination was resisted by the Lagos State chapter of the PDP, but Aganga was approved by senate on 6 July 2011 as Minister. On both occasions Aganga was nominated as minister by General Obasanjo, the former President of Nigeria. Fitch Ratings October 2010 In October 2010, Fitch the rating agency cut the outlook on Nigeria's BB- rating to ‚Äúnegative‚Äù from ‚Äústable‚Äù because of withdrawals from the Excess Crude Account and a drop in foreign currency reserves. Aganga who was at the time, Nigeria's Finance Minister, stated that Fitch Ratings‚Äô action to reduce the outlook on the country's sovereign credit rating was ‚Äúunduly punitive‚Äù. Rice Importation Ends in 2014 In October 2011, Aganga, the Nigerian minister for Trade and Investment announced that rice importation in Nigeria will soon by the end of 2014. Nigeria has used various trade policy instruments such as import restrictions, and outright ban on rice import at various times from 1978 to 1995. All have failed. From October 1978 to April 1979, Nigeria's military government under Gen. Obasanjo, banned imports in containers under 50 kg. In April 1979, the Nigerian government introduced rice imports under restricted license only for Government Agencies. In September 1979, Obasanjo's government introduced a six months ban on all rice imports. In January 1980 the policy was changed again, by the civilian government of Shehu Shagari, this time the government issued Import license for 200,000 tonnes of rice. In October 1980, the same government changed the policy to no quantitative restrictions on rice under general import license. In December 1980, Shagari created a Presidential Task Force (PTF) on rice, and it was named the Nigerian National Supply Company to issue allocations to customers and traders. In January 1984, the Military regime of Muhammadu Buhari disbanded PTF on rice and importation was placed under general license restrictions. In October 1985, a few months after Major General Ibrahim Babaginda appointed himself as President of Nigeria, he imposed a ban on the importation of rice (and maize). During this period, rice was illegally imported into Nigeria through the country's borders. In 1995 the import ban on rice was removed by the then military President of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, because local suppliers failed to meet demand. Since 1995, Nigeria has adopted a more liberal trade policy towards rice, until October 2011, when the civilian government of President Jonathan announced that it was going to ban rice importation in 2014. Nigerians are opposed to the banning of rice. MITI Workers Protest On 30 July 2013, workers (civil servants) of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (MITI), Nigeria staged a protest in front of the ministry's head office, demanding the removal or sack of the minister Aganga for poor performance, gross incompetence and alleged financial misappropriation. The workers had accused the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dauda Kigbu and his wife, Salma Kigbu, of treating the ministry so badly, stating that such liberties will not be tolerated. The workers were also protesting poor office structures and poor welfare packages. Aganga responded by saying President Jonathan had set aside N1 billion (Naira) to start new office, for workers of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, in collaboration with the Saudi Arabian Government. Awards In November 2011, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, conferred on Olusegun Aganga, the National Honour, Commander of the Order of Niger (CON).

Character Sinbad was first introduced into the soap in September 1984, two years after the programme began. The character was introduced as a window cleaner, however he also took a sideline in many illegitimate deals. Over Christmas 1984 he was seen with 'Trevor the turkey', selling it for ¬£10, and then on delivery producing a live turkey knowing that residents including Sheila Grant and Paul Collins would be too sensitive to kill it, thus keeping the deposit for himself. He later quipped that this was Trevor's third year of doing it. The character was a long-time friend and associate of Jimmy Corkhill. His nickname derived from his window-cleaning days and his reluctance to clean into the corners of the windows, instead cleaning a porthole-shape in the centre of the glass. For several years the character was billed simply as 'Sinbad'. Character development While the character of Sinbad was introduced as a light-hearted character with few serious stories, in the 1990s, his character was developed. In 1993, feeling guilty he had kept quiet when he knew Trevor Jordache had beaten Mandy, he helped Beth and Mandy dispose of the body after his murder. Sinbad and Mandy slowly began a relationship, and he stood by her side constantly following her arrest, imprisonment and release. Following this, Mandy gave birth to their daughter Ruth but the couple soon starting drifting apart with Mandy deciding to leave and work in a women's refuge in Bristol taking Ruth with her. Sinbad continued to be a fatherly presence for Mandy's daughter Rachel (Tiffany Chapman) who remained on the close after Mandy's departure. In 2000 the character of Sinbad was written out after he became involved in a child abuse scandal. Business Although originally a window cleaner, after selling No 10 Sinbad invested the money into a shop on Brookside Parade selling used kitchen appliances. The shop was called The Sweeney, from the character's initials and also referencing the 1970s ITV police drama. While working he met Carmel O‚ÄôLeary. Carmel's youngest son, Tim (Tinhead) resented the pair of them becoming so close and tried to upset their relationship the best he could. While running his shop, Sinbad sold a gas cooker to Ron Dixon, who ever the thrifty man installed it himself, despite having little aptitude towards gas installation, the resulting explosion caused great damage to Brookside Parade. Carmel's eldest son Ben was paralysed in the accident, unable to forgive Sinbad for turning a blind eye to Ron's unqualified installation, the two split up. Tim hated Sinbad for a long time following this, to the point where he tried to run him over in his car. However this caused the car to drive into the river with Tim inside, and he was saved from drowning by Sinbad. Following a talk with Ben, Tim decided to forgive Sinbad and the two would become close over the years. Work in the Fish and Chip shop After the demise of Sinbad's business, his friend Mick Johnson gave him a job at the fish and chip shop, 'Chips with Everything. This job came to an end shortly after Sinbad sold a stale pie to Ron Dixon. After Ron made a complaint a health inspector began investigating a local outbreak of food poisoning. Mick confessed that his shop had sold stale food, however it was discovered the shop was not the source of the outbreak, Mick was reported regardless. After the report, Mick was fined and he closed the shop. Departure In 2000, Starke quit the show and later admitted in interviews he resigned as he was exhausted with the gruelling schedule and stated that he was unhappy how the writers had failed to develop his character in his later years. Later on a gang of racists visited the area and attacked Mick, Sinbad was also attacked after intervening. The attack left Sinbad partially deaf. Sinbad struggled to cope with losing some of his hearing and left an interview after his prospective employer treated him in a condescending manner. After being invited to attend a school for deaf children, Sinbad enjoyed his time there and befriended a boy named Andrew. Sinbad also became friends with Andrew's foster mother Barbara, however her other foster son resented Sinbad's presence. When Sinbad was forced to cancel a day out, Kevin took advantage of Andrew's disappointment and manipulated him into accusing Sinbad of sexual abuse, accusations which Barbara believed. Sinbad was questioned by police and released without charge, but was arrested when child pornography was found on the computer that he was the main user of (the offending pictures having being accidentally downloaded by Tim and Emily Shadwick, however the police wouldn't believe them when they attempted to confess). As news of the allegations filtered around the Close, several neighbours automatically assumed Sinbad was guilty (with Ron Dixon, who had a long-standing grudge, taking particular pleasure in making Sinbad's life a misery). Although Mick initially believed Sinbad, seeds of doubt were planted in his mind to the point where he asked his son Leo if Sinbad had ever touched him, and Sinbad felt betrayed when he heard about this. Eventually Rachel (who never doubted Sinbad's innocence) realised that Kevin was, like her, a victim of abuse and talked to him about her own experiences. Kevin confessed that he'd made Andrew make up the allegations and told the truth to the police; he had been abused by his birth mother's husband in the past, which his birth mother didn't believe. Although Sinbad's innocence was proved, his neighbours were slow to apologise and Sinbad decided he had no future on the Close. When Barbara asked him if he wanted to move in with her and the boys, he accepted and after saying a fond farewell to Rachel left Brookside Close for a new start. This story line received mixed reviews, as the character had been largely a light-hearted one.http://www.brooksidesoapbox.co.uk/page17.htm References Sweeney Sinbad Sweeney Sinbad ","title":"Thomas 'Sinbad' Sweeney"},{"id":"26969356","text":"Transmembrane protein 126B is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TMEM126B gene. TMEM126B is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein which is a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex. The TMEM126B gene is conserved in mammals. The encoded protein serves as an assembly factor that is required for formation of the membrane arm of the complex. It interacts with NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 13. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with isolated complex I deficiency. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined on chromosome 9.  Structure  TMEM126B is located on the q arm of chromosome 11 in position 14.1 and has 7 exons. The TMEM126B gene produces a 4.6 kDa protein composed of 54 amino acids. It is a part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex, composed of NDUFAF1, ECSIT, and ACAD9 (by similarity). It associates with the intermediate 370 kDa subcomplex of incompletely assembled complex I. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped configuration. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa. A cartoon representation of the predicted orientation of TMEM126B within cell membrane, tentatively based on the phosphorylation and hydrophobicity data is shown below. left  Function  The TMEM126B gene encodes a mitochondrial transmembrane protein which is a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex. The encoded protein serves as an assembly factor that is required for formation of the membrane arm of the complex. TMEM126B comigrates with other assembly factors including ACAD9, CIA30, and ECSIT. In the absence of TMEM126B, such assembly factors were not recruited into the mitochondrial membrane, and did not participate in complex I assembly. Dysfunction of TMEM126B has known to cause several complications in complex I characterized by severe difficulties in mitochondrial respiration and the complete failure of complex I assembly. However, it is not known to have significant effect on the assemblies of mitochondrial complexes III, IV, and V. Clinical Significance Mutations in TMEM126B is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A complex I deficiency involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, Leigh syndrome, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. In addition to complex I deficiency, TMEM126B mutations also show association with severe multi-system disorders during infancy, such as chronic renal failure and cardiomyopathy, and myopathy in childhood or adulthood.  Discovery  TMEM126B was first discovered in a study of protein expression in tissues of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis using full cDNA cloning. It has since been detected in other tissues.  Gene  TMEM126B is located on chromosome 11 in humans, flanked by the following genes: * DLG2: A member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family. * TMEM126A: A paralog of TMEM126B expressed in the mitochondria. * CREBZF: Also known as the Zhangfei protein, a protein that interacts with herpes simplex virus.  Translation  A conceptual translation of the TMEM126B protein, including a projection of the secondary structure, predictions of transmembrane regions, and putative phosphorylation and glycation sites is included below: File:Human proteins - Conceptual translation of TMEM126B.png  Tissue distribution  TMEM126B is expressed in most tissue types, with the notable exceptions of adipose tissue, ear tissue, the larynx, lymph tissue, nerve tissue, pituitary gland, spleen, thymus, thyroid, trachea, and umbilical cord. It also appears to be highly expressed in parathyroid, bone marrow, and urinary bladder tissue. There is also evidence that one of the isoforms of TMEM126B is expressed in the cell membrane of memory B cells of the adaptive immune system. File:Tmem126B expression.png  Predicted properties  The following properties of TMEM126B were predicted using bioinformatic analysis: * Molecular Weight: 22.7 KDal * Isoelectric point: 9.02 * TMEM126B orthologs have highly variable isoelectric points. * Post-translational modification: several possible phosphorylation sites were detected, and a pair of possible glycation sites were predicted *No signal peptide has been predicted.  Interactions  In addition to co-subunits for complex I, TMEM126B has protein-protein interactions with ECSIT, NDUFAF1, NDUFC2, NDUFA13, and others.

Originally from Mississippi, he worked and lived in Alabama, Florida, California, Boston, and Wyoming. He was a professor at the University of Wyoming until his death. Watson published four books ‚Äì two novels and two collections of short stories ‚Äì to critical acclaim. Early life Watson was born in Meridian, Mississippi on July 24, 1955. He was the second of three sons of Robert Earl Watson and Bonnie Clay. He married his high school sweetheart and had a son together before twelfth grade. They moved to Los Angeles after finishing high school, and worked as a garbage truck driver while aspiring to become an actor. He subsequently returned home to Mississippi after his older brother, Clay, died in a car accident. At the urging of his family, he went back into education, attending Meridian Junior College and then Mississippi State University, where he graduated with a degree in English. Subsequently, he undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Alabama, obtaining a Master of Fine Arts in writing and American literature from that institution. Career After working as a newspaper reporter and editor and at an advertising agency, he returned to the University of Alabama to teach creative writing; he also worked for the university's public relations department. While at Alabama he published Last Days of the Dog-Men (1996), which had taken him ten years to write and won him the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and The Great Lakes New Writers Award. Amy Grace Lloyd, writing for The New York Times twenty years later, called it \\"a near-perfect story collection\\". In 1997 he moved to Harvard University and lived in Boston until 2002. He was a writer in residence at the University of West Florida, the University of Alabama, the University of Mississippi, and the University of California, Irvine. Beginning in 2005, he taught at the University of Wyoming, where he was a professor of creative writing and literature in the Department of Visual & Literary Arts. Watson's 2002 novel The Heaven of Mercury was a finalist for the National Book Award. His 2010 collection of short stories Aliens in the Prime of Their Lives received positive reviews in The New York Times and the Boston Phoenix; its stories contained \\"divorces, miscarriages, an argument that ends in bungled gunplay, a joint-custody visitation, even a touch of incest\\", and Watson himself considered some of them some of the funniest stuff he'd ever written. His work has appeared in The New Yorker. The book was a finalist for The PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011. Two years later, Watson received the Award in Letters from The American Academy of Arts and Letters. His 2016 novel Miss Jane is set in Depression-era Mississippi; its main character, Jane Chisolm, is inspired by one of his great-aunts, a woman with an unknown (to family survivors) urogenital condition that rendered her incontinent and possibly made her incapable of having vaginal sex. Watson has stated in interviews that he could not write the book until he found a medical condition that would seem to fit what little family survivors knew and remembered about his great-aunt's condition. The novel was praised by critics, with Silas House saying it \\"takes Watson's writing to new heights\\". The novel was one of ten books long-listed for The National Book Award in Fiction in 2016. It was an ebook bestseller on Amazon.com in 2020. Subject matter and style Watson is frequently called a Southern writer, and acknowledged his heritage and his love for family and friends, particularly after moving to Wyoming in 2005. At community college in Meridian, he became inspired by William Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren, and Flannery O'Connor. He is praised for his portrayal of Southern issues and problems (racism and segregation being one of the subject matters of Heaven of Mercury), but commented also on stereotypical simplifications of the South in other parts of America: > For all the ways [the South] is struggling and, yes, deficient, or failing, > flailing, it is also a place full of wonderful people, and possibly one of > the most diverse places in the country. Not that everyone gets along. There > is ignorance, there is racism. There are also more proud people trying to > change that than might be apparent from the results at the polling booths. > But writing the book, I was just thinking about these people, trying to make > them real people in the reader‚Äôs mind. Here‚Äôs an anecdote, though. I was at > a tea party or the like at a famous university in the early stages of > researching Miss Jane, and I asked the host--who was a pediatrician, for > goodness sake--if he could speculate on what might have been my great aunt‚Äôs > condition. His response was, \\"You're from Mississippi, right? Is there any > history of incest in your family?\\" Death Watson died on July 8, 2020, at his home in Laramie, Wyoming. He was 64; his wife believed it was due to heart failure.

Early life Davis was born on January 29, 1855 in New York City. He was the son of Robert Vernon Davis (1830‚Äì1913) and Mary (n√©e Samler) Davis (1837‚Äì1912). A descendant of \\"old New York\\" families, his maternal grandparents were Jane Ogden (n√©e Mansfield) Samler and Nicholas Samler, a grandson of Casper Samler, who owned land that today comprises the greater part of Fifth Avenue from Madison Square to 31st Street. After attending public and private schools in New York, he graduated from City College in 1876.

At the same time he studied law, graduated from Columbia Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1879. He commenced practice working for the law firm of McDaniel, Wheeler & Souther. In October 1881, he opened his own law firm known as Davis, Cohen & McWilliam. In January 1885, Davis was appointed by D.A. Randolph B. Martine a Deputy Assistant New York County District Attorney. In January 1888, D.A. John R. Fellows appointed Davis an Assistant D.A., and he remained in office under De Lancey Nicoll and during Fellows's second term. After Fellows's death on December 7, 1896, Davis was appointed Acting D.A. by the Court of General Sessions, pending the filling of the vacancy by Gov. Levi P. Morton. On December 19 1896, Gov. Morton appointed Alderman William M.K. Olcott as D.A., and Davis resumed his post as Asst. D.A. until his resignation in April 1897. On January 1, 1901, Davis succeeded Elbridge T. Gerry as President of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, but resigned this post after his election to the Supreme Court.

Opened in June 1956, its first movie was The Searchers, starring John Wayne, and Magnificent Roughnecks, starring Jack Carson. It operated for 35 years until an economic boom along the corridor and a turn towards enclosed movie theaters resulted in its closure in September 1991. The site became a Costco warehouse store and an enclosed movie theater. History Opening on June 30, 1956, the first Loews Theatres open-air theater in the state, it was built to be ultimate family-safe destination. Built on a former watermelon farm, it was originally destined for a shopping center, but instead a drive-in was built to provide an all-inclusive night for both the parents and children. The property was surrounded by landscaping and tree walls to block the screen and viewing area from the traffic on the then-moderately busy Route 35. The theater offered free admission for children, a fully equipped concession stand that sold boardwalk food, such as hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza, in addition to the movie fare of popcorn and candies, and restrooms. For the children, it offered a circus-themed playground with electric rides and miniature ride-on train with a diesel engine and a clown to help supervise the children. Demise Raising real-estate prices, the trend toward compact multiple- screen indoor theaters and the arrival of the VCR was the ultimate demise of the last drive-in at the time in the state. It had often offered more real romance, adventure and family entertainment in the parking lot than was available vicariously from the screen. Drive-in culture suffered most in the crowded Northeast, where one suburb melted into the next and land values soared. In order to avoid interference from the bright lights of cities, most drive-ins were built on the outskirts of towns, where there was plenty of vacant ground and good access to main roads. Those same qualities later made drive-in lots perfect sites for shopping malls. Ironically, it was the owner of the theater and property, National Amusements, who petitioned Hazlet in 1988 to rezone the outdoor theater for a shopping center. Despite objections, the plans were approved. Today, the property is now the site of a Costco and the 13-theater Cinemark Hazlet 12. Specs The theater employed the following equipment: * Two (2) Motiongraph film projectors with Ashcraft Cinex arc lamps, allowing for a throw * Motiongraph speaker/intercom boxes with built-in heaters, later replaced with an AM transmitter * A Shelby screen measuring Events=Concerts For the 10th anniversary of the drive-in, they hosted Bruce Springsteen and his band, The Castiles, on July 29, 1966. The band open festivities at 7 p.m. and plays a 90-minute show until darkness and movie time. The featured film was the comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming. Films The drive-in was used for scenes in the 1987 slasher film Blood Rage (The Nightmare at Shadow Woods). Film crews spent an entire day at using the concession stand and screen for use in the movie. Written by Bruce Rubin and directed by John Grissmer, it was produced by Marianne Kanter and starred Louise Lasser.

It is the second such Moomin film produced by Finnish children's film company Filmkompaniet, the first being Moomin and Midsummer Madness, and the first one converted to stereoscopic 3-D. A similar revision of the remainder of the series for high-definition television of all 78 episodes will follow and is currently in production. The same novel has been adapted into film at least twice before, with the 1978 Russian stop motion serial Mumi-troll and the 1992 Japanese traditional animation feature Comet in Moominland. The international version of the film features the voices of known Swedish actors like Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Peter Stormare, Alexander Skarsg√•rd. Musician and Moomins fan Bj√∂rk also wrote an original song for the film. The international film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2010. In Finland, it arrived in movie theaters on 6 August 2010 and was later broadcast on the MTV3 channel. The film was also produced in dozens of other languages and subsequently received global distribution. Plot One day Moomintroll wakes to notice that grey dust is covering everything in the Moominvalley. He runs to ask the philosophical Muskrat if he knows what is happening, who advises him that things tend to look like this before an awful fate coming from the sky hits the Earth. With the help of his father, Moominpappa, Moomintroll and his close friends Sniff and Snufkin build a raft and head out on a challenging journey to the observatory in the Lonely Mountains hoping to find out more from the wise professors there. The friends have to overcome several adversities in order to make it there. When they arrive, they find the professors deep in calculations. They reveal that a comet will reach the Earth in four days, four hours, four minutes and 44 seconds. The group decides to get back home as fast as they can to share the news. On the journey home, they encounter more dangerous creatures and obstacles as well as some old and new friends, including Snork Maiden and her brother Snork, who join them on their adventure. The sky continues to become redder and the air hotter. When they get to the seashore, they are shocked to see that the sea has completely dried up. A walk along the dried out sea bottom brings more excitement and danger. Eventually they make it back home to the Moominhouse and discover another shocking detail: the comet is supposed to land right in their own garden that very night. Ultimately, the big question is if they can get everybody to safety in time.

Antonia Ringbom, a Finnish director, producer, animator and illustrator who specializes in children's programming, is working on the project's title sequence, which combines her animation with the theme song performed by Bj√∂rk. Bjork said: \\"I read the books as a child and then I read them for my children. I guess I realised that I still like them just as much. They probably stand for something Nordic, I think there's something quite stark, a certain kind of simplicity. You could speculate and say, 'because there are fewer plants there, and fewer animals, fewer buildings, so it's kind of more minimal. I've sometimes compared it to Scandinavian furniture , compared to Italian furniture. Italian - hundreds of little details, curls and curves and decoration - and Scandinavian furniture is kind of naked. And it's funny and sad at the same time. And the relationship to nature Tove Jansson has, that's very important to me. And everybody's allowed to be just as eccentric as they are, they don't have to conform. Reading to my children I actually noticed some kind of anti-authority aspect in it ‚Äì there's no hierarchy between the characters, they are all equal. I like that a lot.\\"Bjork, speaking on BBC Radio 4, Front Row, 4 August 2010 ReferencesExternal links * * * * Film page on the Finnish Film Foundation website Category:Moomin series Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:2010s stop-motion animated films Category:2010 3D films Category:3D animated films Category:2010s fantasy films Category:Films based on fantasy novels Category:Films based on Finnish novels Category:Films about trolls Category:Finnish films Category:Finnish animated films Category:Impact event films Category:Fictional comets ","title":"Moomins and the Comet Chase"},{"id":"26969500","text":"Marco Antonio Martinez Dabdoub is a Mexican politician.

Algie Martin Simons (1870‚Äì1950) was an American socialist journalist, newspaper editor, and political activist, best remembered as the editor of The International Socialist Review for nearly a decade. Originally an adherent of the Socialist Labor Party of America and a founding member of the Socialist Party of America, Simons' political views became increasingly conservative over time, leading him to be appointed on a pro-war \\"labor delegation\\" to the government of revolutionary Russia headed by Alexander Kerensky in 1917. Simons was a bitter opponent of the communist regime established by Lenin in November 1917 and in later years became an active supporter of the Republican Party. Biography=Early years Rural Sauk County, Wisconsin, in 2007 ‚Äî other than the paved road, not terribly different than it would have looked a century earlier. Algie Martin Simons was born October 9, 1870, in a log house near the hamlet of North Freedom in Sauk County, Wisconsin, the son of a farmer.Kent Kreuter and Gretchen Kreuter, An American Dissenter: The Life of Algie Martin Simons, 1870-1950. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1969; pg. 2. He was the eldest of four children of Horace B. Simons and his wife, the former Linda Blackmun.Robert Stuart Huston, A.M. Simons and the American Socialist Movement. PhD dissertation. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1965; p. 1. Simons' father was descended from English immigrants who had arrived in America in the early 18th Century. His grandfather, Martin Simons, for whom he was named, was born in Ohio in 1812 and moved to Wisconsin in the 1840s, spending some time in Minnesota before returning to Wisconsin during the years of the American Civil War. On the maternal side, the Blackmuns also had deep roots in New England, with the family already established in upstate New York by the time of the American revolution.Huston, A.M. Simons and the American Socialist Movement, pg. 2. The Blackmuns made their way to Ohio before heading North to Michigan and settling for good in Wisconsin in the early 1800s. After Horace Simons and Linda Blackmun were married in July 1869, the Blackmuns aided the new couple by providing land for them adjacent to the family homestead on Maple Hill, part of the western side of the Baraboo Range.Huston, A.M. Simons and the American Socialist Movement, pp. 1-2. The land was not bountiful and agriculture was difficult; Horace Simons helped make ends meet by working as an employee in the Blackmuns' seasonal roofing shingle mill. A bookish youth, Simons attended public school at North Freedom, graduating in 1889. He developed the skill of oratory at a young age, winning a local speaking championship in July 1890.Baraboo Republic, July 30, 1890; cited in Huston, A.M. Simons and the American Socialist Movement, pg. 5. After completion of his primary education in North Freedom, Algie commuted 10 miles to Baraboo to attend high school, from which he graduated in 1891.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 4. From there, Simons was off to Madison to attend the University of Wisconsin, majoring in English. While at the university, Simons developed an interest in politics and history and transferred to the School of Economics, Political Science, and History, newly established by Richard T. Ely, to pursue the subject further.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 8. In the course of his education, Simons was exposed to socialist ideas, working as an assistant for the liberal Ely on his book Socialism, published in 1894.See Socialism: An Examination of its Nature, its Strength and its Weakness, with Suggestions for Social Reform, Thomas Crowell, 1894, pg. x, for Ely's acknowledgment of Simons' help. Simons also later regarded the courses taken from Frederick J. Turner as influential for having instilled the notion of class struggle in his pattern of thinking.A.M. Simons, \\"How I Became a Socialist,\\" The Comrade [New York], vol. 2, no. 1 (August 1902), pp. 254-255. In June 1895, Simons earned his bachelor's degree in Economics, for which he gained special honors for completing a thesis on the topic of \\"Railroad Pools.\\" Simons also won awards in oratory and debating and accumulated a grade point average which entitled him to membership in Phi Beta Kappa.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 15. He was chosen by the faculty to speak at his class's commencement exercise. Upon graduation, Simons accepted a fellowship with the Associated Charities in Cincinnati, moving into the Cincinnati Social Settlement in September 1895.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 17-18. He was soon brought to Chicago by the head of Associated Charities in Cincinnati to work for the Bureau of Charities there.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 20. Simons found the conditions faced by the urban poor of Chicago to be appalling and he began to make a systematic study of daily life in the meatpacking district of the city, publishing his findings in the American Journal of Sociology.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 28-29. In June 1897, Simons returned to Baraboo and married May Wood, a former high school classmate who would herself eventually become a socialist propagandist of some note.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 34. After three years living in the \\"Settlements\\", Simons' self-described \\"patchwork philosophy\\" began to give way to Marxism as he daily observed \\"human misery and intense suffering\\" on the one hand and \\"the marvelous productive capacity of the largest industrial establishment in the world\\" on the other. He attended the 1897 National Conference of Charities and Corrections in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and came away disgusted, returning to Chicago and joining the ranks of the Socialist Labor Party. A new chapter in his life had begun. The Socialist Labor Party Cover of Simon's first pamphlet, Packingtown, first published in 1899. This June 1907 reprint was made without the characteristic red glassine wrapper. In the spring of 1899, Algie Simons found himself finally able to escape his previous calling of social work for a new career he considered more fulfilling ‚Äî that of socialist newspaper editor. Section Chicago of the SLP, 26 branches strong, decided at that time to launch its own newspaper in order to cover the news from a more localized perspective than could the East Coast party organ. The erudite and educated Simons was chosen by his party comrades to edit the new publication. In just a few short months this new position would place Simons in direct conflict with party leader Daniel DeLeon, editor of the party-owned weekly of the SLP, The People, published in New York City.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 41-42. The first issue of The Workers' Call was dated March 11, 1899, and featured the first of a lengthy serialized article by Wilhelm Liebknecht, translated by May Wood Simons from the German.Wilhelm Liebknecht, \\"Socialism: What it Is and What it Seeks to Accomplish,\\" The Workers' Call, Part 1: vol. 1, no. 1 (March 11, 1899), pp. 3-4; Part 2: vol. 1, no. 2 (March 18, 1899), pg. 3; Part 3: vol. 1, no. 3 (March 25, 1899), pg. 3; Part 4: vol. 1, no. 4 (April 1, 1899), pg. 3; Part 5: vol. 1, no. 5 (April 8, 1899), pg. 3. Each issue contained four pages of heavily written and densely packed grey type. Cover price was one cent, with annual subscriptions available for 50 cents per year. As a matter of policy, Simons printed the number of \\"copies actually sold\\" of the preceding issue in every copy of the paper, indicating an initial sale of 1,875 copies quickly moving to an average sale of about 3,000 copies. Simons gained another spate of readers in June, when it was announced that the Minneapolis SLP newspaper, The Tocsin, was to be merged with The Workers' Call after a run of just over 9 months.\\"The Tocsin: Notice of Consolidation with The Workers' Call,\\" The Workers' Call, vol. 1, no. 15 (June 17, 1899), pg. 1. By the first day of summer, paid circulation was approaching the 9,000 mark and by the end of July it had sold out a full run of 11,000.Paid sales figures appeared on the masthead on page 2 of each issue. Despite the rosy prospects of Section Chicago's new paper, the summer of 1899 was a moment of severe political crisis inside the SLP. The party had experienced significant growth throughout the decade of the 1890s, but disagreement over the policy of the organization towards the trade union movement had created bitter dissension. Some favored the official line of the party, building the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (ST&LA;), a dual union which was distinctly revolutionary socialist in nature to stand in direct challenge to the \\"conservative\\" American Federation of Labor. Others objected to the way this new ST&LA; had poisoned relations with the existing unions, and instead advocated a renewed commitment to \\"boring within\\" the established unions to \\"win\\" them to the socialist cause by example and persuasion. Personal acrimony and ambition also played no small role, with self-assured and pugnacious DeLeon and his lieutenant Henry Kuhn butting heads against the more ecumenical supporters of the privately owned German-language socialist paper, the New Yorker Volkszeitung, such as Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit. In 1898, the simmering feud erupted into a full-fledged factional war. With left wing German and Yiddish-language trade unions of New York pulling out of the ST&LA;, leaving it a shell, while socialists still in the AF of L were simultaneously dealt a crushing blow to their efforts at the 1898 annual convention of the AF of L to steer the organization in a left wing direction, the Volkzeitung went on the offensive. For the next five months the paper hammered relentlessly at the way the dual union policy had led to an easy \\"Gompersite\\" victory.Ira Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, 1897-1912. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952; pg. 30. The SLP's English-language People and German-language Vorwaerts returned fire in kind, accusing the dissidents of having traded in socialist principles for the prospect of soft positions as union functionaries.Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, pp. 30-31. The governing National Executive Committee of the party began unleashing a series of suspensions and expulsions of the dissidents in the name of party discipline.Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, pg. 31. The dissidents escalated matters further by issuing a factional bulletin devoted to attacks on the party leadership, sent out to the entire party mailing list ‚Äî an action which further enraged DeLeon and his associates. Things went downhill from there, with fist fights and a full out brawl capping the summer of factional sniping, as both dissidents and regulars claimed for themselves the mantle of the party, its ballot line, and, not coincidentally, the party's assets.Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, pp. 32-33. Try as they might, there could be no neutrality in such a situation. Section Chicago first attempted to play the role of mediator in the dispute, suggesting a referendum of the party membership to move headquarters of the SLP from New York City to a less supercharged political environment. Such a position was impossible for DeLeon and the official leadership, who charged Section Chicago with disloyalty, making editor Simons the personal object of enmity.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 43. \\"This A.M. Simons, Editor,\\" DeLeon raged, \\"really is as much of a simpleton as he is a fraud.\\"The People, September 24, 1899. Quoted in Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 43. And thus Simons cast his lot with the rebellion. \\"If there had ever been any doubt in the past three months about the necessity of a revolution in the Socialist Labor Party and the utter abolition of DeLeonism from the American socialist movement, that doubt should be removed by a glance at the last Beekman Street People, Simons replied.A.M. Simons, \\"Good Riddance,\\" The Workers' Call, vol. 1, no. 34 (October 28, 1899), pg. 2. When the smoke of the muskets cleared, DeLeon's forces emerged triumphant, thanks in no small part to a ruling of the New York courts awarding the party name, ballot line, and assets to the Regular faction. Slobodin, Hillquit, and the dissidents, after having called themselves the \\"Socialist Labor Party\\" and published an official newspaper called The People until so enjoined by the court; thereafter they attempted to style themselves as a part of the Social Democratic Party of America. The originators of the Social Democratic party, including Milwaukee newspaper editor Victor L. Berger and radical railroad unionist Eugene V. Debs, were deeply distrustful of the motives and worth of the recently recoined DeLeonists from New York who had appropriated their party name. The process of unification of the two organizations was arduous, absorbing the better part of two years. In August 1901, union between the East coast and Chicago \\"Social Democratic Parties\\" was achieved at the 1901 Socialist Unity Convention held in Indianapolis, Indiana. Simons was a delegate to this convention, at which he was one of the most vocal advocates that the new organization should dispense with so-called \\"immediate demands\\" from its platform, in favor of limitation to the advocacy of the socialist transformation of society. Simons declared: Simons' view on this matter of immediate demands represented that of a small left wing minority of the delegates to the Founding Convention and was easily defeated on the floor of that body. Charles H. Kerr & Co. Cover of the first edition of Simons' The American Farmer (1902), published by Charles H. Kerr & Co. and regarded by many as Simons' most significant work of socialist theory. In addition to his position as editor of the Chicago weekly, The Workers' Call, and to his role in the formation of the Socialist Party of America, Algie Simons occupied a prominent place in the affairs of the largest Marxist publisher in the United States to that date, Charles H. Kerr & Co. of Chicago. From the middle years of the 1890s, Unitarian book and magazine publisher Charles H. Kerr of Chicago became attracted to the ideas of first populism and then Marxist socialism. Just as Simons and Section Chicago of the SLP were launching The Workers' Call, so too was Kerr changing the direction of his publishing house, launching a new monthly series of small pamphlets in red glassine covers called the \\"Pocket Library of Socialism\\" on May 15, 1899.\\"Pocket Library of Socialism\\" (advertisement), The Workers' Call, vol. 1, no. 14 (June 10, 1899), pg. 4. The first number of the series was by May Wood Simons, Woman and the Social Problem, while husband Algie chipped in title number 4, Packingtown: A Study of the Union Stock Yards, Chicago. Having previously published a Unitarian magazine, Unity, followed by a Populist magazine, The New Era, Kerr sought to mark the new phase of his intellectual journey with a new monthly magazine dedicated to international socialism. This journal, The International Socialist Review, was going to need an editor. Charles Kerr believed he had his man in the person of Algie Simons. The first issue of the Review appeared dated July 1900 and featured contributions from William Thurston Brown, English social democrat Henry Hyndman, AF of L trade union activist Max S. Hayes, and Marcus Hitch.The International Socialist Review [Chicago], vol. 1, no. 1 (July 1900), passim. The complete run of International Socialist Review was reprinted in book form and as microfilm by Greenwood Press in 1968. In his introductory editorial, Simons listed three goals for the new \\"magazine of scientific socialism\\" ‚Äî \\"to counteract the sentimental Utopianism that has so long characterized the American movement,\\" \\"to keep our readers in touch with the socialist movements in other countries,\\" and \\"to insure the interpretation of American social conditions in the light of socialist philosophy.\\"A.M. Simons, \\"Salutatory,\\" The International Socialist Review [Chicago], vol. 1, no. 1 (July 1900), pp. 54-55. Simons would edit the magazine, in addition to fulfilling additional editorial tasks as editor of The Workers' Call and its successor, The Chicago Daily Socialist, for nearly eight years. While at the Chicago Daily Socialist, Simons initially supervised the business department but later requested a transfer to the editorial department, where he supervised all editorial work.A.M. Simons, \\"Biography for Illinois University (June 1916),\\" Simons Papers, box 1, folder 4, pg. 7. A relative latecomer to the socialist movement, Simons came in as a radical enthusiast. At the 1901 founding convention of the Socialist Party of America held in Indianapolis, to which he was a delegate, Simons was the most vocal advocate of the left wing line of the day, arguing against the adoption of palliative \\"immediate demands.\\" On the other hand, his employer, Charles H. Kerr, who came into the socialist movement about the same time as Simons, was on an altogether different ideological trajectory. Kerr took less solace from the advances of the Socialist Party in the electoral realm, particularly among middle class intellectuals such as himself, and instead came to identify more and more with the revolutionary industrial unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), established in 1905. Particularly after the formation of the IWW, Kerr sought to make the somber magazine edited by Simons lose its dry, academic tone and to instead become what Kerr would later call \\"the fighting magazine of the working class.\\" By the end of 1907, the political differences between publisher Kerr and editor Simons and their view of the future of the magazine had become unworkable.Allen Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade\\": Charles H. Kerr & Company, Radical Publishers. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997; pg. 116. Effective at the start of 1908, Kerr forced the resignation of Simons as editor of The International Socialist Review.Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade,\\" pg. 117. Simons ended his monthly editorial in the January 1908 issue of the magazine with a terse statement which summarized everything and told nothing: \\"With this number I sever all editorial connection with the International Socialist Review.A.M. Simons, \\"Looking Forward and Backward,\\" International Socialist Review [Chicago], vol. 8, no. 7 (January 1908), pg. 435. The short editorial itself gave a clue to the reasoning behind Simons' growing disillusionment with the socialist movement: The form and content of the Review changed fairly dramatically in the years after Simons' forced departure, with Kerr and his new chief lieutenant, Mary Marcy, soliciting material written on issues of the day by its working class readers. Shorter articles giving timely news of the contemporary class struggle, profusely illustrated, displaced long and sometimes dreary essays notable only for their lack of passion. Slick magazine paper began to be used for the better reproduction of photographs, while provocative pictorial covers were henceforth employed. The tone of the magazine became more vigorous and radical. The changes wrought by Kerr, Marcy, and their associates paid great dividends in terms of circulation. Formerly stalled at a circulation level of less than 5,000, the circulation to the Review tripled during Kerr's first year at the helm and rose to 27,000 by June 1910.Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade,\\" pg. 118. Henceforth, The International Socialist Review would take its place as the leading voice of the left wing of the Socialist Party of America. Algie Martin Simons, by way of contrast, would increasingly be known as a spokesman for the policies of the party's right. Simons in Kansas Following his departure from Charles H. Kerr, Simons contributed to an upstart Chicago socialist journal, The Modern Magazine (Oct. 1909). In the summer of 1910, the Simons familily headed for Southeastern Kansas, where Algie took a position in Girard working for The Appeal to Reason.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 113. Appeal publisher Julius Wayland was launching a new publication, a literary- and artistically-oriented weekly reprising the original name of the Appeal ‚Äî The Coming Nation ‚Äî and Algie Simons was Wayland's selection for editor of the new periodical. Time was of the essence for Wayland in obtaining additional editorial talent, as Appeal editor Fred Warren sat behind bars, convicted to a 6-month sentence for inciting violence through the mails as the result of a provocative editorial he had written.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 119. Despite his best intentions of producing a publication that did not dwell in the realm of heavy political expos√©, Simons found a paucity of publishable material written on vaguely socialist themes in a light-hearted vein.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 121. With little humor or light fiction from which to choose, The Coming Nation inevitably moved into the usual heavier political fare, with the farmer's son Simons once again revisiting a theme near and dear to him in a series of articles: the role of the farmer in the American socialist movement.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 122. During his time in Kansas, Simons was also able to finally finish a historical work which he had been working for years, a book entitled Social Forces in American History, published by the commercial publisher Macmillan & Co. in 1911. Simons' book was a temperate survey of American history from the age of discovery through Civil War reconstruction written through the prism of class struggle. Although Simons professed that he was writing as a Marxist, the tone and content of the work was so moderate that some reviewers did not even recognize the book as a socialist document.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 131. May Simons was also active during the couple's time in Girard, trying her hand at fiction-writing for The Coming Nation albeit with limited success.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 126. Also contributing fiction was a youngster hailing from Philadelphia, who would later achieve wider fame as the owner of the entire Appeal operation, Emanuel Julius, who wrote pedestrian short stories in the O. Henry style for virtually every issue.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 127. Far more typical and worthy of the publication were muckraking pieces of non-fiction, such as expos√©s on coal mining and the faintly-disguised theft of public lands. As a radical literary and artistic magazine, none would confuse The Coming Nation with the more avant-garde publications which would follow with greater success, such as The Masses, The Liberator, and The New Masses, instead being more akin to the glossy weekend supplement of the New York Call. Simons was a journalist, not an artiste, and Girard, Kansas, was not the literary mecca that was New York City. Nevertheless, The Coming Nation managed to carve out its own distinct identity during its nearly three years of existence. That it was not able to build a sufficient readership to achieve financial independence ultimately spelled its doom. Another factor lead to the abrupt termination of The Coming Nation in 1913 ‚Äî the inevitable reorganization of The Appeal to Reason's operations following the death of its founder, J.A. Wayland. On the evening of November 10, 1912, just three days after the finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th ‚Äî and arguably most successful ‚Äî campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened a drawer and removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed the gun in his hand, raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the brain. Wayland never regained consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than a small fraction of the laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph tucked into a book on his bedside table: \\"The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass.\\"Henry Vincent, Wayland: The Editor with a Punch, An Appreciation. Massilon, OH: Henry Vincent, 1912; pg. 5. Cited in Elliott Shore, Talkin' Socialism: J.A. Wayland and the Role of the Press in American Radicalism, 1890- 1912.

Simons had grown tired of small town life in Kansas in any event and was ready for a new challenge. Newspaper publisher Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling as though it was for the time being the best he could do.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 142-143. Algie and May Simons would be coming home to Wisconsin. Simons at the Leader Algie Simons' $35-a-week job in Milwaukee represented a cut in pay from what he had been previously receiving at the Appeal, and his wife May decided to help supplement the family income by accepting a job as a teacher in the Milwaukee public schools.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 144, 148. The Simons played no role in the bustling political activity of the governing Socialist Party in Milwaukee, instead taking an interest in the theater, musical recitals, and public lectures, often in the company of Victor Berger and his wife Meta.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 149. At the Leader, Simons initially served as editor of the national edition, although he filled in as a reporter and copy reader in case of emergency. For several months he worked as managing editor of the publication.A.M. Simons, \\"Biography for Illinois University,\\" pg. 9. May Simons in particular became less and less political, resigning her position on the National Women's Committee of the Socialist Party at the end of 1914 and beginning to attend meetings of her old college sorority.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 149-150. In the summer of 1914, World War I erupted in Europe. European socialists were singularly unable to stop the march of their various national governments to a particularly bloody conflagration. Algie Simons made the effort to write to both Ramsay MacDonald and Keir Hardie, leaders of the British Independent Labour Party, urging them to make every effort to keep the Second International alive, thereby preserving lines of communication with the socialists of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 151. Though both parties agreed in the desirability of the policy which Simons advocated, they proved incapable of its implementation, as the belligerent national governments of both sides shut down all means of contact.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 151-152. Simons stood behind the official policy of the Socialist Party of America to embargo the shipment of arms and food to warring Europe, co- authoring an official agitational leaflet on behalf of the party along with Carl D. Thompson, Dan A. White, John C. Kennedy, and Walter Lanfersiek entitled \\"Starve the War and Feed America!\\"\\"Million Leaflets to Flood Land in First Big Campaign Effort,\\" The American Socialist [Chicago], vol. 1, no. 6 (August 22, 1914), pg. 1. Ultimately, there was a choosing of sides by many American socialists with regards to the European conflict. Milwaukee, with deep ethnic connections to Germany, including several German-language newspapers, and many clubs, schools, and social institutions, was a hotbed of pro-German sentiment, whereas Algie and May Simons soon came to take a position which was more or less unabashedly pro-British.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 155-156. After the sinking of the Lusitania in the spring of 1915, a passenger liner which was carrying armaments into the war zone in defiance of an announced German submarine blockade, Algie and May Simons became even more rigid in their views, with May professing in her diary that \\"I doubt whether I ever again could believe in the German having good qualities.\\"Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 157. Cloaking his exact views on the European war behind the platitude that \\"the entrance of this nation into armaments competition means this war will end only in a truce leading to more wars,\\"William English Walling et al. (eds.), The Socialism of Today. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1916; pg. 623. Simons campaigned for a place on the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in 1916, falling to defeat. In November 1916, Simons moved over the river and burned his bridges behind him, resigning from the Milwaukee LeaderEdward John Muzik, Victor L. Berger: A Biography. PhD dissertation. Northwestern University, 1960; p. 273. and beginning a series of bitter attacks upon the leadership and policies of the Socialist Party. In the December 2, 1916, issue of the liberal news magazine The New Republic, Simons declared that \\"Intellectually and politically, the mind of the party is in Europe. The Socialist Party and press had no criticism of the Invasion of Belgium, the sinking of the Lusitania, the Zeppelin outrages, the slave drives in Belgium, or the ... Armenian massacres.The New Republic, December 2, 1916, pg. 118, cited in Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 160. Simons became an outspoken advocate of so-called military preparedness, an organized campaign for increased militarization in America sponsored by leading politicians of the day, such as former President Theodore Roosevelt, as well as pressure groups such as the American Defense Society.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 159. Similar organizations were formed at the state level. In February 1917, a group of Milwaukee businessmen and civic leaders established a group called the Wisconsin Defense League, initially formed to collect statistics to be used in conjunction with any future program of military conscription, to aid in the recruiting of military officers, and to stand ready to lend any assistance which the government might subsequently request.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 165. At the end of March 1917, this Wisconsin Defense League hired Simons as its state organizer, paying him a salary of $40 per week. War was in the wind. War years On April 6, 1917, one day after President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany for its resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in an attempt to maintain the military blockade of its enemies, the Socialist Party of America assembled in St. Louis for an Emergency Convention. The assembled delegates voted overwhelmingly to continue the organization's outspoken anti-militarist position with respect to the European war, a position entirely untenable with the views harbored by the increasingly conservative Algie Simons. Simons declared a war of his own against the American socialist movement, unleashing his guns in the Milwaukee Journal, conservative competitor of his former employer, the Leader. Simons proclaimed the Germans to be the real militarists and declared that they must be stopped before they enslaved the world.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 163. Simons wrote to Senator Paul O. Husting of Wisconsin, urging him to suppress the St. Louis Resolution of the Socialist Party as treasonous propaganda and providing the Senator with a list of the allegedly seditious activities of his former employer, Victor Berger, since 1914.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 164. When news of this correspondence leaked, Simons was immediately expelled from the Socialist Party by Local Milwaukee, by a vote of 63 to 3. Within months, the Wisconsin Defense League changed its name and grew teeth, calling itself the Wisconsin Loyalty Legion, with Simons as head of the group's literature department.David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 100. This organization engaged in repressing \\"unpatriotic\\" activity during the war, urging boycotts of the German-language press, opposing the teaching of the German language in the schools, coercing citizens into the purchase of government Liberty Bonds, and gathering mobs to shout down socialist and other \\"disloyal\\" speakers. Simons found additional income in this period covering labor news on behalf of the Milwaukee Journal.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 177. In September 1917, Simons attended the organizational meeting of the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy, a pro-war labor group headed by Samuel Gompers and designed to build working class loyalty to the American war effort.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 174. This organization proved to be a puppet of George Creel's Committee of Public Information, the formal war propaganda bureau of the Wilson administration. As the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy stood aloof from partisan politics, Simons sought to consort with like-minded fellows in the newly formed Social Democratic League of America, a group which included other former Socialists of a pro-war inclination, such as William English Walling, John Spargo, Upton Sinclair, and Emanuel Haldeman- Julius.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 175. Simons also joined the short-lived National Party, established the following month largely through the Social Democratic League's volition as part of an attempt to form a broader center-left political party. The Social Democratic League conceived of the idea of sending an official American labor delegation to Europe in an attempt to rekindle the lagging support of war-weary European socialists for the effort against Germany. The idea was brokered to Secretary of State Robert Lansing, who approved of the mission and requested that the immediate formation of a group to be known as the American Socialist and Labor Mission to Europe. On June 14, 1918, Simons received word that he had been chosen as part of the delegation and he proceeded immediately to New York to embark.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 178-179. The American Socialist and Labor Mission remained in England throughout the first half of July 1918, meeting with many of the leading figures of the British labor and socialist political movements and attempting to win their support for the Americanized war effort. Simons spoke at two public meetings held by the mission during this interval, garnering an ovation.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 181-182. The mission then moved to Paris on July 20, 1918, to find a mood even more dispirited than that of the pessimistic British, later moving on to Italy before heading home in September.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pp. 189-190. Upon returning, Simons set to work on a new book, The Vision for Which We Fight. He also distanced himself from the social democratic movement, refusing to accept employment as an organizer for the Social Democratic League, now headed by his friend Charles Edward Russell.Kreuter and Kreuter, An American Dissenter, pg. 193. Conservative years From 1931 to 1950, Simons was employed as an economist by the American Medical Association.Finding Aid for the Algie M. Simons and May Wood Simons Papers, 1901-1951, Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison, Wisconsin. During this period he was the author of a number of articles on medical economics. Death and legacy Algie Martin Simons died in 1950. He was survived by his wife, May Wood Simons, and their daughter, Miriam. The papers of Algie Simons and May Wood Simons are housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society, located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

In essence data classification consists of using variables with known values to predict the unknown or future values of other variables. It can be used in e.g. direct marketing, insurance fraud detection or medical diagnosis.Kimball, R. et al. (2008). The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit. (2. Ed.). Wiley. The first step in doing a data classification is to cluster the data set used for category training, to create the wanted number of categories. An algorithm, called the classifier, is then used on the categories, creating a descriptive model for each. These models can then be used to categorize new items in the created classification system.Golfarelli, M. & Rizzi, S. (2009). Data Warehouse Design : Modern Principles and Methodologies. McGraw-Hill Osburn. Effectiveness According to Golfarelli and Rizzi, these are the measures of effectiveness of the classifier: *Predictive accuracy: How well does it predict the categories for new observations? *Speed: What is the computational cost of using the classifier? *Robustness: How well do the models created perform if data quality is low? *Scalability: Does the classifier function efficiently with large amounts of data? *Interpretability: Are the results understandable to users? Typical examples of input for data classification could be variables such as demographics, lifestyle information, or economical behaviour. Challenges There are several challenges in working with data classification. One in particular is that it is necessary for all using categories on e.g. customers or clients, to do the modeling in an iterative process. This is to make sure that change in the characteristics of customer groups does not go unnoticed, making the existing categories outdated and obsolete, without anyone noticing. This could be of special importance to insurance or banking companies, where fraud detection is extremely relevant. New fraud patterns may come unnoticed, if the methods to surveil these changes and alert when categories are changing, disappearing or new ones emerge, are not developed and implemented.

That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as \\"a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.‚Äù The phrase curbstone broker or curb-stone broker refers to a broker who conducts trading on the literal curbs of a financial district. Such brokers were prevalent in the 1800s and early 1900s, and the most famous curb market existed on Broad Street in the financial district of Manhattan. Curbstone brokers often traded stocks that were speculative in nature, as well as stocks in small industrial companies such as iron, textiles and chemicals (see curb trading). Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under notable curb-stone brokers such as Emanuel S. Mendels. History=1860s-1880s: New Board and Open Board The New Board was an organization of curb-stone brokers established in 1836 in New York City to compete with the New York Stock and Exchange Board. The first local rival of the NYSE, the New Board emerged among the rough and tumble conditions of the very speculative curb-side trading during the down-turn in the market in general.Sloane, Leonard 1980 The Anatomy of the Floor, Doubleday: Garden City, New York, p. 22. The \\"curb\\" or \\"outside\\" trading exchange used a system in which \\"brokers and dealers traded directly with each other in the street near the exchange.\\" To compete, the NYSE quickly began offering a second daily opportunity to buy or sell securities. At first, the New Board was very successful. It remained larger than the Big Board until 1845, but the New Board's brokers were \\"crushed\\" by the Panic of 1837 and the recession that followed, and it folded in 1848. Curbstone brokers often traded stocks that were speculative in nature. With the discovery of oil in the latter half of the 19th century, even oil stocks entered into the curb market. By 1865, following the American Civil War, stocks in small industrial companies, such as iron and steel, textiles and chemicals were first sold by curbstone brokers. In August 1865, a reporter described the curb market in front of the new exchange building on Broad Street. \\"There were at least a thousand people on the sidewalk and street... Buyer and seller, speculator and investor, operator and spectator, agent and principal, met face to face, upon the curb and beneath the sweltering sun, opened their mouths wide and screamed all manner of seeming nonsense at each other\\". The curb market grew further out of the Open Board of Brokers, previously in a building on New Street. Founded in part by former curbstone brokers, the Open Board of Stock Brokers was an early regional stock exchange established in 1864, which merged with the NYSE in 1869. After the Open Board joined the Consolidated Exchange, Open Board members specializing in unlisted stocks were left without \\"a roof over their heads and took to meeting casually in the course of the day in convenient lobbies in the [financial] district.\\" The brokers were ousted by a number of buildings as their numbers grew, until they ended up in front of the Mills Building entrance on Broad Street. 1890s-1907: Broad Street curb market The curb market moved to Broad Street near Exchange Place in the 1890s. Around 1895, leading curb-broker Emanuel S. Mendels began promoting the idea of the market moving indoors, an idea which wouldn't be actively picked up for two more decades. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer. After decades of involvement in the curb exchange, Mendels became the recognized \\"proctor\\" of the curb, and he alone would decide on the quotation lists. He also used his influence to throw out fraudulent stocks and dishonest brokers. In 1904, Mendels began to organize the curb, in an effort to cut down on swindling and other problems. Also that year, Mendels published the first annual directory of reliable brokers. In the mining boom of 1905 and 1906, the Curb market attracted some negative publicity for the \\"wholesale use of the Curb for swindling.\\" Around late 1907, Mendels as Curb agent began devoting most of his time to keeping the Curb market \\"free of swindling stocks.\\" As of 1907, Mendels gave the brokers rules \\"by right of seniority,\\" but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships. The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a \\"little domain of asphalt\\" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street, after Police Commissioner McAddo took office. As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage. The noise caused by the curb market led to a number of attempts to shut it down. In August 1907, for example, a Wall Street lawyer sent an open letter to the newspapers and the police commissioner, begging for the New York Curb Market on Broad Street to be immediately abolished as a public nuisance. He argued the curb exchange served \\"no legitimate or beneficial purpose\\" and was a \\"gambling institution, pure and simple.\\" He further cited laws relating to street use, arguing blocking the thoroughfare was illegal. The New York Times, reporting on the open letter, wrote that brokers informed of the letter \\"were not inclined to worry.\\" The article described \\"their present ground on the broad asphalt in front of 40 Broad Street, south of the Exchange Place, is the first haven of which they have had anything like indisputed possession.\\" 1908-1910: Increased formalization Broad Street and Curb Brokers, circa 1909. In 1908, the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers. E. S. Mendels was a leading curbstone broker who organized the Curb Market Agency. As of February 1909, Mendels remained \\"Curb agent,\\" meaning he was essentially the only authority figure in the unorganized curb market on Broad Street. On February 26, 1909, he gave a \\"very complete and satisfactory\\" testimony to the Wall Street Investigating Committee on how the curb brokers did business. He also gave testimony on their restrictions concerning new business, and how swindlers were dealt with. On November 10, 1909, Mendels issued a notice reading that \\"For the protection of the public, complaints made in writing against any corporation or individual using the New York Curb market, directly or indirectly, will be investigated by the agency and referred to the proper authorities for suitable action.\\" At the time, the Curb market still had no official organization. The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or \\"Big Board,\\" operating several buildings away at 18 Broad Street. Explained by The New York Times in 1910, the Big Board had always looked at the curb as \\"a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'\\" On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its \\"unlisted department,\\" the NYSE stocks \\"made homeless by the abolition\\" were \\"refused domicile\\" by the curb brokers on Broad Street they turned to. The decision was made by the \\"Curb agent and his advisory board,\\" who ruled via their control of the printed lists of transactions. They held a \\"solemn conclave\\" and decided that the NYSE stocks would not be added until they had complied with the \\"Curb list\\" of requirements. Among the refused stocks were International Power Company and the Metropolitan Street Railway Company. The Times wrote the Metropolitan Street Railway had experienced severe ups and downs on the NYSE, which \\"rival of worst of the manipulative scandals that the Curb has been trying to live down.\\" In 1910, Mendels again testified before the Wall Street Investigating Committee on behalf of the curb brokers, when an attempt was made to dislodge them from Broad Street. The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables. 1911: New York Curb Market Association Stock trading on the New York Curb Association market on Broad Street circa 1916, with brokers and clients signalling from street to offices. Many members used flamboyant hand signals to conduct trades. Based on a constitution drafted in 1911 to eliminate \\"irresponsible brokers and valueless stocks from the outside market,\\" in 1911 the New York Curb Market Agency became the New York Curb Market, with offices in the Broad Exchange Building. In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered as the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.http://abcnewspapers.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=11281 New York Curb Market Association On March 16, 1911, the Curb Association elected its first Board of Representatives. The board corresponded to the Governing Committee of the Stock Exchange and had the \\"task of keeping the outside market in order.\\" Members included E. S. Mendels, J. L. McCormack, E. M. Williams, C. H. Pforzheimer, E. A. Chartrand, T. J. Newman, W. A. Titus, Franklink Leonard, Jr., H. P. Armstrong, F. T. Ackermann, W. Content, Carl Rawley, R. Godwin, A. B. Sturges, and E. I. Connor. On October 8, 1916, The New York Times reported that leaders of the Curb Association favored a complete reorganization of trading in Broad Street, and were hastening efforts to get the \\"Curb under a roof\\" to allow for limited membership and fixed rules. To further its goals, the special curb committee pointed to recent violence on the curb among mining brokers, after fist fights broke out the week prior. A second fist fight among Broad Street brokers occurred on October 7, 1916, with the police warning that the next time the two combatants would be arrested. Curb Association chairman Edward Reid McCormick noted that the mining brokers had not been members of the Curb Association, leaving \\"no way for the Curb officers to inflict discipline.\\" The fist-fights occurred over the lack of delivery of Emma Copper and Old Emma Leasing stock. Official Curb Exchange building In 1920, the New York Evening Post stated that the market presented a \\"motley, agitated mass of struggling, yelling, finger- wriggling humanity.\\" In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool‚Äù that \\"tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.‚Äù After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector Streets, at 86 Trinity Place. The curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921. By 1930, the Curb Exchange was the leading international stock market, \\"listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.\\" That year, the building's trading floor was doubled in size, with the entrance moved to 86 Trinity Place. Later curb markets The new San Francisco Curb Exchange started activities on January 2, 1928, using the unlisted securities formerly on the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange. Per the agreement behind the formation of the curb market, all members of the Stock and Bond Exchange held memberships in the new curb exchange. The Curb had an authorized 100 charter members, 67 from the Stock and Bond Exchange, and the remaining made available for sale. On the second day of a strike by United Financial Employes, there was violence outside the Curb Exchange and NYSE on March 30, 1948. The incident occurred in the early morning, when picketers attempted to bar entrance to the NYSE building by lying on the sidewalk in front of the doors. 12 were hurt and 45 arrested in a battle between police and picketers, although the protests \\"failed to prevent the two security markets from operating at virtually normal rates.\\" There was no violence on the Curb, although picketers and their sympathizers later lined outside the exchange that day, numbering around 1,200. At the time, Francis Adams Truslow was president of the Curb Exchange. Methods and culture \\"Curb\\" or \\"outside\\" trading the involves brokers and dealers trading directly with each other in the street, for example near a stock exchange in a financial district. Historically, curbstone brokers often traded stocks that were speculative in nature. To get attention and be recognized on the curb in Manhattan, many members dressed in attention-grabbing clothes and used flamboyant hand signals to conduct trades. Curb market at Broad Street 1902. Wrote a local resident in 1907, each morning at 10 o'clock the \\"multitude\\" of \\"brokers, brokers' clerks, lemonade and provision vendors, messenger boys, 'lambs' awaiting slaughter, and numerous other attaches and camp followers of the noisy and disorderly throng breaks forth with a volley of discordant screams which rend the air for several blocks, and then bedlam reigns until the gong again sounds at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, to the confusion and discomfort of the whole surrounding neighborhood.\\" In August 1865, a reporter described the curb market in front of the new exchange building on Broad Street. \\"There were at least a thousand people on the sidewalk and street. Every man shouted; each wore his hat on the top of his head; nearly every man had a moustache, and it seemed to us if twenty bedlams could unite their most violent voiced roarings in one vast and deafening howl, they would fail to parallel the absolute maniacrison of the scene. Buyer and seller, speculator and investor, operator and spectator, agent and principal, met face to face, upon the curb and beneath the sweltering sun, opened their mouths wide and screamed all manner of seeming nonsense at each other, while their hats tipped far toward the small of their backs, their eyes strained fiercely and their arms waved wildly above their heads, from which rolled rivers of profuse perspiration.\\" Notable curb markets *New Board *New York Curb Exchange *Montreal Curb Market *San Francisco Curb Exchange (1928-1938) *Chicago Curb Exchange (1928-1938) See also * Economy of New York City * List of stock exchanges in the Americas * List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas *New Board ReferencesFurther reading * * Category:Self-regulatory organizations in the United States Category:Stock exchanges in the United States ","title":"Curbstone broker"},{"id":"26969901","text":"The Early Widows is the fourth album by Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Rutledge, released on May 4, 2010 on Six Shooter Records.

It corresponds to the Einasleigh Uplands savanna ecoregion, as identified by the World Wildlife Fund. Location and description This area is inland from the moist Queensland coast but is not as dry as the Brigalow Belt and the Mitchell Grass Downs savannas to the south, while the Cape York Peninsula to the north is lower-lying and wetter. The region contains a number of specialised habitats that add to the variety of wildlife found here. These include lava flows and caves such as those of Chillagoe. The uplands are an area of eroded volcanic rock on and to the west of the Atherton Tableland in the northern section of Australia's Great Dividing Range running inland as far as the town of Croydon in the southwest. The plateau is covered in grassland dotted with eucalyptus trees and cut through with ridges, gorges and lava tubes. The area has rich fertile soil. Natural features include the Great Basalt Wall of dried volcanic lava and the lava tubes of Undara Volcanic National Park. Rivers that have their source in the uplands include the Flinders River which runs northwest to the Gulf of Carpentaria along with the Palmer, Mitchell and Gilbert-Einasleigh while the Burdekin and Herbert Rivers run south-east from the tablelands to the Coral Sea coast. Urban areas include Herberton and Croydon. Climate The climate is cooler than the coast with summer nights being as cool as 9 ¬∞C compared with 20 ¬∞C on the coast. The summer high temperatures are around 35 ¬∞C. There is a wet season between December and March. Flora This stony upland habitat is dominated by ironbark eucalyptus woodland but there are wetlands and patches of rainforest too. Lava flows are home to stands of thicker forest. Fauna These woodlands are home to many animals including a number of marsupials such as the antilopine kangaroo, the large eastern grey kangaroo and the near-endemic Godman's rock-wallaby and Mareeba rock-wallaby. There are a number of endemic mammals, reptiles and insects in the region especially in the more thickly forested areas where a large number of endemic reptiles occur. The caves and lava flows harbour specific wildlife of their own as do the wetter east-facing slopes of the uplands. Rivers such as the Burdekin have important populations of waterbirds as do the unique (to Australia) wetlands of Innot Hot springs. Threats and preservation The area has long been used for cattle ranching but apart from the heavily farmed Atherton Tableland is thinly populated so the landscape is well preserved although it has been changed by overgrazing, clearance for agriculture and the introduction of weeds. Some areas of the acacia gidgee (Acacia cambagei) in the southeast of the uplands have suffered in particular. There are a number of protected areas containing a good variety of the different types of habitat found in the region, including Undara and the Great Basalt Wall as well as Blackbraes National Park, Kinrara National Park, Littleton National Park, part of Bulleringa National Park and the caves of Chillagoe.

Senator Bill Nelson arrive at the Shuttle Landing Facility. The space policy of the Barack Obama administration was announced by U.S. President Barack Obama on April 15, 2010, at a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center. He committed to increasing NASA funding by $6 billion over five years and completing the design of a new heavy-lift launch vehicle by 2015 and to begin construction thereafter. He also predicted a U.S.-crewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s, preceded by the Asteroid Redirect Mission by 2025. In response to concerns over job losses, Obama promised a $40 million effort to help Space Coast workers affected by the cancellation of the Space Shuttle program and Constellation program. The Obama administration's space policy was made subsequent to the final report of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, which it had instituted to review the human spaceflight plans of the United States in the post-Space Shuttle era. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010, passed on October 11, 2010, enacted many of the Obama administration's space policy goals. Background President Obama, Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden watch NASA's Lunar Electric Rover at the 2009 inaugural parade. In November 2007, the Obama presidential campaign released a policy document delaying NASA's Constellation program by five years to fund education programs. There was concern that any delay would prolong the gap after the Space Shuttle's retirement, when the US would be dependent on the Russian government for access to the International Space Station. Other presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, did not support the delay. In January 2008, the Obama campaign revised its position, supporting the immediate development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares I rocket to narrow the gap. However, the new policy was silent on the heavy lift Ares V rocket and missions beyond low Earth orbit. Obama gave the first major space policy speech of his campaign in Titusville, Florida in August 2008. He subsequently approved a seven-page space plan that committed to target dates for destinations beyond low Earth orbit: Obama was noted for \\"having offered more specifics about his plans for NASA than any U.S. presidential candidate in history\\". Augustine Commission 250px The Obama administration instituted the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, also known as the Augustine Commission, to review the human spaceflight plans of the United States after the time NASA had planned to retire the Space Shuttle. Their goal was to ensure the nation is on \\"a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space.\\" The review was announced by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on May 7, 2009. The report was released on October 22, 2009.Sciencemag ‚Äì No to NASA The Committee judged the nine-year-old Constellation program to be so behind schedule, underfunded and over budget that meeting any of its goals would not be possible. The President removed the program from the 2010 NASA budget request and a bi-partisan congress refused to fund it any longer, effectively canceling the program. One component of the program, the Orion crew capsule, was added back into plans, but only as a rescue vehicle to complement the Russian Soyuz in returning Station crews to Earth in the event of an emergency. In its final report, the Committee proposed three basic options for exploration beyond low Earth orbit, and appeared to favor the third option: * Mars First, with a Mars landing, perhaps after a brief test of equipment and procedures on the Moon. * Moon First, with lunar surface exploration focused on developing the capability to explore Mars. * A Flexible Path to inner Solar System locations, such as lunar orbit, Lagrange points, near-Earth objects and the moons of Mars, followed by exploration of the lunar surface and/or Martian surface. In his April 15, 2010 space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center announcing the administration's plans for NASA, none of the 3 plans outlined in the Committee's final report was completely selected. The President rejected immediate plans to return to the Moon on the premise that the current plan had become nonviable. He instead promised $6 billion in additional funding and called for development of a new heavy lift rocket program to be ready for construction by 2015 with crewed missions to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s.President Barack Obama on Space Exploration in the 21st Century Space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center Attendees included then-NASA administrator and Obama appointee Charles Bolden, Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, Representative Suzanne Kosmas (D-FL), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), among others. Modification of Orion Obama announced the modification of the Orion capsule from its original purpose as a crewed spacecraft for flights to the ISS and the Moon into an emergency escape capsule for the International Space Station, reducing American reliance on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Destinations The new policy changes from Vision for Space Exploration and Constellation program Moon-first approach to a variety of destinations resembling the flexible path approach: Obama promoted the idea of a crewed mission to orbit Mars by the mid-2030s with a landing as a follow-up. Reliance on commercially operated launch vehicles The Falcon 9 rocket Obama referenced in his speech was first launched on June 4, 2010. In a major shift in the function of NASA in American human spaceflight, the Obama administration proposal would rely solely on launch vehicles designed, manufactured, and operated by private aerospace companies, with NASA paying for flights for government astronauts. Prior to the speech, Obama toured the launch facilities surrounding the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle with CEO Elon Musk which has received NASA funding through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program and could loft NASA astronauts under the new plan. In the speech, Obama referenced the maiden flight of the Falcon 9, which would go on to launch successfully less than one and a half months after the speech: Extension of ISS operations Obama also announced an extension of funding for International Space Station operations, 90% complete by mass at the time of the speech but scheduled to be deorbited by as early as 2015 before Obama announced the extension, which will provide funding through 2020. Heavy-lift launch vehicle In the speech, Obama announced the development of a new Heavy Lift Vehicle (HLV) to replace the planned Ares V, with the design planned for completion by 2015, two years prior to the Constellation plan, and construction commencing thereafter: ResponseSupport= Prior to the speech, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk released a statement praising the proposal and criticizing Senators who had opposed it and former NASA administrator Michael Griffin: Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin released a statement in support of the plan via the White House on February 1, prior to the announcement of the 2011 federal budget, which included the changes Obama announced in the speech: =Criticism= Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell, and Eugene Cernan, commanders of Apollo 11, Apollo 13, and Apollo 17 respectively, said: * \\"When President Obama recently released his budget for NASA, he proposed a slight increase in total funding...the accompanying decision to cancel the Constellation program, its Ares 1 and Ares V rockets, and the Orion spacecraft, is devastating.\\" * \\"It appears that we will have wasted our current ten plus billion dollar investment in Constellation and, equally importantly, we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded.\\"Civilian Military Intelligence Group Neil Armstrong Writes A Letter To Obama. One That Perhaps We Should All Read, by Daniel Russ on April 14, 2010 * \\"For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature.

On July 1, 2010, the NASA administrator, Charles Bolden, said in an interview with al-Jazeera: \\"When I became the Nasa administrator, he [Mr Obama] charged me with three things. One, he wanted me to help reinspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering.\\" The NASA Authorization Act of 2010, passed on October 11, 2010, authorized funds for NASA for fiscal year 2011‚Äì2013, and enacted many of his stated space policy goals. A total of $58 billion in funding is called for, spread across three years. The 2011 budget legislation, passed in April 2011, officially terminated the Constellation program. The passage of the budget frees NASA to start working on the new initiatives. In September 2011, details were announced of the Space Launch System, a Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle being developed by NASA as a replacement for the Ares I and Ares V rockets of the Constellation program. The Obama administration cut NASA's planetary-sciences budget by 20 percent in 2013, as part of a restructuring plan, contrary to the recommendations of the National Research Council. In January 2014 the Obama administration announced it would seek to extend the operational life of the International Space Station by four more years to 2024.

Etymology  The Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve and the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan take their name from the Ashuapmushuan River. This river flows into Lake Saint-Jean and was frequently traveled by fur traders at the time of the New France and also the English regime, in order to make commercial treaties, especially human trafficking fur. This river was a preferred axis to connect in canoes between Lac Saint- Jean and James Bay. This area is renowned for hunting and fishing.

Spectrum Definition Many countries have allocated spectrum for UWB use, with various restrictions and power output limits. The standardized output level for UWB communications is The WiMedia Alliance has defined fourteen 500-MHz bands to divide up the 3.1-10.6 GHz spectrum allocated for Ultra-Wideband communications in the U.S. in 2002. Many countries had already allocated some spectrum <6 GHz for other uses such as GPS and satellite communications and therefore desired a way to protect those existing devices and applications while allocating additional spectrum for UWB communications, with the idea that UWB devices would avoid the traditional transmitters when they came into geographical proximity or radio range. DAA stands for ‚ÄúDetect and Avoid‚Äù and is a similar technique to cognitive radio that was defined for this legacy coexistence. Cognitive radio attempts to detect ‚Äúprimary users‚Äù and switch communications to another unused channel. Cognitive Radio is often in the news for trying to make use of the ‚ÄúWhite Space‚Äù between legacy TV broadcast channels. DAA is different in that UWB communications continue on the same band, but actually notch out the transmit spectrum around the legacy channel, so that they don't interfere but can make use of the channel. The requirement of DAA was placed on the Band Group 1 spectrum by the E.U. and others in 2006 with an implementation deadline of Dec 31, 2010. Due to the U.S. recession and financial difficulties for the UWB developing companies, there was less pressure on the E.U. to exactly define how silicon should implement DAA and companies have not fully implemented DAA. Therefore, devices with global regulatory certification usually use BG3 and BG6 since those bands do not have a DAA requirement. However, China did formally extend their DAA enforcement deadline to Dec 31st, 2013 for Bands 1, 2, and 3China official notice delaying DAA enforcement in BG1 to Dec 31st, 2013. and South Korea formally extended their DAA enforcement deadline to Dec 31st, 2016 for Band 3.South Korea official notice delaying DAA enforcement in Band 3 to Dec 31st, 2016.  Logical Channel Organization  Burst errors can occur in a single frequency due to RF noise. Therefore, interleaving symbols over three different UWB bands should minimize the total burst length in the message, improving the likelihood of error correction, thus improving the immunity of the signal. There is a slight time penalty for each frequency change because the PLL clocks have to settle at the new frequency. Therefore, the WiMedia PHY Spec organizes the UWB Bands into Band Groups where a single logical channel can be defined that uses all three bands in the band group. Time Frequency Interleaving (TFI) channels spread their data across three frequency bands, while Fixed Frequency Interleaving (FFI) channels stay on a single frequency band during all time slots. UWB Frequency Interleaving The two tables below are pulled directly from the WiMedia PHY Specification, v1.5. The Time Frequency Codes (TFC) define the frequency interleaving sequence for utilizing 1-3 of the bands within a band group. TFCs 1-4 are for TFI channels, TFCs 5-7 are for FFI channels, and TFCs 8-10 are for TFI2 channels, which simply interleave their data across two bands. Note that all TFCs will be in the same band at some time during their sequence. TFC numbering of 1-10 repeats for each band group and these TFC numbers are primarily used by the MAC and PHY layers. However, a different numbering system is needed by higher layers to command the radio to switch to a unique logical channel across all of the UWB bands and band groups. This logical channel number is used by the application layers, such as the Wireless USB interface. As you can see from the table below, the FFI channels for BG1 and BG3 are 13-15 and 29-31, while the TFI channels for BG1 and BG3 are 9-12 and 25-28. As an example, Japan allows usage of 7392-7920 MHz, which is Band9, the highest frequency band in Band Group 3. This corresponds to Channel 31, also known as BG3 TFC 7.  UWB Measurements and Calculations  In order to properly measure a UWB signal with a spectrum analyzer and compare it to the -41.3dBm/MHz, you should use the following settings. If you connect a UWB transmitter directly into a spectrum analyzer (conducted with a cable, no antenna over the air), you should get values in the -43dBm to -40dBm range. * Detector: RMS (NOT Peak. Use Average if RMS is not available) * Sweep: 1ms/point. (In the image, 601points on the screen, 601ms sweep, so 1ms/pt. This averages/integrates the power received over 1ms) * RBW: 1 MHz * VBW: 3 MHz Spectrum Analyzer Screenshot This SpecAn screenshot shows BG1 TFC5, channel 9. Note the three bands, with gaps in between. If you are doing tests in an Anechoic or Semi-Anechoic chamber, you have to account for the conversion between dBm power in a 50ohm cable to dBuV/m electric field over the air, as well as the antenna and preamp gains and the long cable loss between the receiving chamber antenna and the spectrum analyzer. For an example calculation, see pages 13‚Äì15 of the TDK Test Report for FCC ID: YYJ-5390144, the \\"WUSB Host Radio Board\\".  Practical Considerations  Within a single band group, the maximum number of non- overlapping channels is actually three. Any time two devices are transmitting at the same frequency and within radio range (<10m), regardless of their logical channel they will either look like noise to each other or must logically share the timeslots in the channel. Three FFI channels will each use an individual band and will never overlap. In the TFI interleaving channel sequences, the channels will periodically hop into the same frequency and overlap.

It is identified to be the main carcinogen of the ferns and to be responsible for their biological effects, such as haemorrhagic disease and bright blindness in livestock and oesophageal, gastric cancer in humans. Ptaquiloside has unstable chemical structure and acts as a DNA alkylating agent under physiological conditions. It was first isolated and characterized by Yamada and co-workers in 1983. The pure form ptaquiloside is a colorless amorphous compound. It is readily soluble in water and fairly soluble in ethyl acetate. Except in the plants, ptaquiloside has been detected in the milk and meat of affected livestock, as well as in the underground water and dry soil around bracken fern vegetation. The prevalence of ptaquiloside in daily sources along with its carcinogenic effects make it an increasing biological hazard in modern days. Sources=In plants and food chains Croziers, fronds, rhizomes of bracken fern The presence of ptaquiloside has been detected in a variety of ferns, including the species in the genera Pteridium (bracken), Pteris, Microlepia, and Hypolepis. Pteridium aquilinum (commonly known as bracken fern) is the most common ptaquiloside-containing fern with a wide geographical and ecological distribution. It is present in all continents from subtropic to subarctic areas. Bracken fern is a very adaptable plant and is capable of forming dense, rapidly expanding populations in course of the first phases of the ecological succession in forest cleanings and other disturbed rural areas. Its aggressive growth, characterized by an extensive rhizome system and rapidly growing fronds, sometimes enables it to be a dominant species in certain plant communities. The ptaquiloside content of bracken varies widely across species and changes with the part of the plant, the plant growing site and the collecting season. According to previous studies, the concentrations of ptaquiloside in bracken varied between 0 to 1% of the dry weight of the plant. Generally, ptaquiloside is found to occur in the highest concentrations in the young developing parts of bracken, such as the croziers and unfolding parts during the spring and early summer, while the concentrations of ptaquiloside in the rhizomes are rather low. However, studies on the concentrations of ptaquiloside in Danish bracken by Rasmussen et al. showed that the concentrations of ptaquiloside in the rhizomes were significantly higher than the previously reported values. Ptaquiloside can pass into the milk produced by bracken-fed cows and sheep. In 1996, Alonso-Amelot, Smith and co-workers found that ptaquiloside was excreted in milk at a concentration of 8.6 ¬± 1.2% of the amount ingested by a cow from bracken, and was linearly dose-dependent. On the basis of their experiments and the assumption that a person drinks 0.5 litres of milk daily, they estimated that this person might ingest about 10 mg of ptaquiloside per day, although only some of that amount will be absorbed. Ptaquiloside can also leach from the bracken leaves into water and soil. Numerous studies have reported the presence of ptaquiloside in the underground/surface water, and soil near bracken vegetation. The degradation speed of ptaquiloside in the soil is affected by the acidity, clay content, carbon content, temperature and presumably microbioactivity. Acidic condition (pH<4) and high temperature (at least 25‚ÑÉ) facilitate ptaquiloside degradation, while the half-life of ptaquiloside in less acidic sandy soil is reported to be between 150 and 180 hours. Ways of ptaquiloside exposure Main routes that can lead to human exposure to the toxic effects of bracken fern include ingestion of the plant (particularly the croziers and young fronds), inhalation of the airborne spores, consumption of the milk and meat of affected animals, and drinking ptaquiloside contaminated water. Mechanism of action Ptaquiloside has unstable chemical structure and readily undergoes glucose liberation. The resulting ptaquilodienone is the active form of ptaquiloside and accounts for the observed biological effects. The cyclopropyl group in the dienone is highly reactive as an electrophile, not only because it is conjugated with the keto group, but because it also constitutes a cyclopropyl carbinol system, from which the facile formation of the stable non-classical cation is well-known. General mechanism In acidic conditions, ptaquiloside gradually undergoes aromatization with the elimination of D-glucose to afford ptaquilosin, and finally pterosin B. Under weakly alkaline conditions, ptaquiloside and its aglycone ptaquilosin are converted into an unstable conjugated dienone intermediate. This ptaquilodienone is the activated form of ptaquiloside and is regarded as the ultimate carcinogen of bracken ferns. Due to the constitution of a cyclopropyl carbinol system, ptaquilodienone is a strong electrophile and acts as a powerful alkylating agent that reacts directly with biological nucleophiles including amino acids, nucleosides, and nucleotides under weakly acidic conditions at room temperature (as shown in the scheme below). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The mechanism of action of ptaquiloside Mechanism of ptaquilodienone with deoxytetranucleotide } Under physiological conditions Under physiological conditions, ptaquiloside readily liberates glucose to produce the ptaquilodienone. The alkylation of amino acids with the dienone mostly takes place at the thiol group in cysteine, glutathione and methionine. The alkylation at the carboxylate group of each amino acid, forming the corresponding ester, is also observed to a small extent based on the previously reported literature. The dienone reacts with both adenine (majorly at N-3) and guanine (majorly at N-7) residues of DNA to form the DNA adducts. The alkylation induces spontaneous depurination and cleavage of DNA at adenine base site. In a model reaction with a deoxytetranucleotide (as shown on the right), a covalent adduct is found at a guanine residue and the N-glycosidic bond breaks to release the adduct. In 1998, Prakash, Smith and co-workers showed that the alkylation of adenine by ptaquiloside in codon 61 followed by depurination and error in the DNA synthesis resulted in the activation of H-ras proto-oncogene in the ileum of calves fed bracken. Syndromes Bracken is known to have various biological effects, such as carcinogenicity and its well-defined syndromes in livestock and laboratory animals. Ptaquiloside is proved to be responsible for several of these biological effects, some of which are species specific. Ruminants Cattle that consume bracken ferns develop acute bracken poisoning and chronic bovine enzootic haematuria (BEH). The main feature of acute bracken poisoning in cattle is the depression of bone marrow activity, which gives rise to severe leucopenia (particularly of the granulocytes), thrombocytopenia, and acute haemorrhagic crisis. However, most of the researchers believe ptaquiloside is not the direct causing agent of the acute bracken fern poisoning. The main feature of haematuria is urinary bladder tumors and haematuria in cattle after prolonged exposure to bracken. Based on the extensive studies, a positive correlation is shown between the ptquiloside concentration and the incidence of BEH. Sheep fed by a diet containing bracken develop acute haemorrhagic disease and bright blindness. The main features of the blindness include progressive retinal atrophy and stenosis of the blood vessels. In 1993, Yamada group proved ptaquiloside was the compound causing retinal degeneration. Species-specific syndromes caused by ptaquiloside Non-ruminants Rats that were given a diet containing ptaquiloside for a prolonged period developed tumors in both the ileum and urinary bladder. Prakash, Smith and co- workers showed that ptaquiloside-induced carcinogenesis was initiated by the activation of the H-ras oncogene. Other non-ruminants such as pig, rabbit, and guinea pig, also develop syndromes after ingestion of ptaquiloside, which include haematuria, tumors and organ abnormities (see the diagram). Human populations Bracken fern increases the oncogenic risk in humans. Epidemiological survey revealed that bracken fern consumption was positively correlated with esophageal cancer and with gastric cancer in many geographical areas of the world. In 1989, Natori and co-workers showed that ptaquiloside had clastogenic effect and caused chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells. In 2003, Santos group reported significantly increased levels of chromosomal abnormalities, such as chromatid breaks in cultured peripheral lymphocytes. Control and detection The use of bracken fern as human food is mainly a historical question. The rhizomes of these plants served as human food in Scotland during the First World War. In America (USA, Canada), Russia, China and Japan, fern is grown commercially for human use. The usual procedure that is performed before eating the plant is to pre-treat the fern with boiling water in the presence of different chemicals, such as sodium bicarbonate and wood ash, to degrade or inactivate ptaquiloside and other toxic agents. Nevertheless, some carcinogenic activity persists even after the treatment. As shown by Kamon and Hirayama, the risk of oesophageal cancer was increased approximately by 2.1 in men and 3.7 in women who regularly consume bracken in Japan. Recent researches have suggested that sulfur-containing amino acids can potentially be used under appropriate conditions as detoxifying agents for ptaquiloside and selenium supplementation can prevent as well as reverse the immunotoxic effects induced by ptaquiloside. Ptaquiloside in the aqueous extract of bracken can be detected using different instrumental methods: thin- layer chromatography‚Äìdensitometry (TLC-densitometry), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GCMS), and liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (LC-MS). The diagnostic tests of ptaquiloside inside cells include gene mutation detection, immunohistochemical detection of tumor biomarkers, chromosomal aberrations, oxidative stress for EBH, PCR, real-time PCR and DNase-SISPA (sequence-independent single primer amplification). Total synthesis In 1989 and 1993, Yamada and co-workers reported the first enantioselective total synthesis of both the enantiomers of ptaquilosin, the aglycone of ptaquiloside. In the first step, the menthyl ester of cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1 was partially hydrolyzed to afford the monomenthyl ester, which was later alkylated with methallyl bromide in the presence of HMPA to selectively produce 2. The product 2 was then converted to the acid chloride and treated with stannic chloride to effect Friedel-Crafts acylation to give enone 3. Hydride reduction, selective oxidation of the allylic alcohol, and silylation were then performed to provide compound 4. On treatment with base and a chloroethyl sulfonium salt, a mixture of spirocyclopropanes was obtained. The minor product 5a can be isomerized with p-toluenesulfonic acid to 5b with 81% yield. Desaturation by selenylation/dehydroselenation and basic peroxide oxidation afforded epoxide 6. Mild reduction, methyl Grignard addition, and oxidation gave compound 7. Methylation of the cyclopentanone under Noyori‚Äôs condition using the TASF enolate produced a mixture of isomers. The undesired isomer 8a can be equilibriumed with potassium tert-butoxide in 81% yield to exclusively generate 8b. Reduction, deprotection, and oxidation afforded 9. On treatment with oxygen in warm ethyl acetate, the aldehyde on 9 was oxidized to the acyl radical for decarbonylation. Stereoselective trapping of the tertiary radical by oxygen gave the hydroperoxide 10. Under mild reduction, the naturally occurred (-)-ptaquilosin 11 was obtained. The Yamada‚Äôs synthesis proceeded in 20 steps with an overall yield of 2.9%. Similarly, the unnatural (+)-enantiomer of ptaquilosin was synthesized from the diastereomer of 2. Total synthesis of (-)-ptaquilosin Multiple synthetic studies directed towards ptaquilosin 11 have been reported since 1989. In 1994, Padwa and co-workers described the synthesis of the core skeleton of ptaquilosin by a highly convergent approach. In 1995, Cossy and co-workers reported novel routes to the racemic and optically active ptaquilosin skeleton. Their properly functionalized tricyclic compound would be of great utility for the synthesis of 11.

This newly found genus of leech takes sustenance from the mucous membranes of the mammalian upper respiratory tract, and is known to feed upon humans. It has eight teeth. Tyrannobdella rex was discovered feeding upon the mucous membrane of a girl who had recently bathed in the upper Amazon in Peru. Genetic studies show that it is closely related to Dinobdella ferox, a similar species found in Taiwan. Characteristics External anatomy of Tyrannobdella rex. Whole body ventral view illustrating annulation, relative size of the caudal sucker, and relative position of gonopores. Unlike related leeches, Tyrannobdella rex has a single jaw with one row of teeth. Its eight teeth are disproportionately large, with a length of up to 0.13 mm, which inspired discoverers of the species to use a name reminiscent of Tyrannosaurus rex. These teeth are about five times as long as those in the related genus Limnatis; most often one will only see six teeth of T. rex with a microscope as the others are subcutaneous. The closely related leech Pintobdella chiapasensis features a likewise reduced number of teeth, namely six per jaw, but in turn it has three jaws. Life and diet As a juvenile, T. rex will bite into the mucous membranes (mucosae) of its host and feed on their blood. In contrast to other leeches, T. rex does not drop off its host after feeding but can remain attached at the site of its bite for days and weeks. After a time it can reach a length of up to 7 cm. Tyrannobdella rex favours the mucosae of mouth, nose and throat in humans. Other leeches that also settle in mucosae have been found in noses but as well near the eyes and in the genitourinary system of mammals. Symptoms When Tyrannobdella rex inhabits the nasal cavity it can cause strong headaches. Because of its small size the leech is most often not discovered immediately. Taxonomy The characteristical single jaw in this leech has led to the establishment of a new genus Tyrannobdella, of which only T. rex is known so far. A genus with only one species is called monotypic. The finding of Tyrannobdella rex and genetic comparisons of its genome to other leeches that infest the mucosae of mammals has brought new insight to their taxonomy. T. rex was put into the family Praobdellidae, which also includes the genera Praobdella, Pintobdella, Myxobdella, Dinobdella, Limnatis, and Limnobdella. Most of these are found in Africa and Asia, Tyrannobdella rex being the only one from South America. Its closest relative, Pintobdella chiapasensis, is native to Mexico, where it infests tapirs. The sister group to Praobdellidae is made up of the two South American families Semiscolescidae (genera Semiscolex and Patagoniobdella) and Macrobdellidae (genera Macrobdella, Philobdella and Oxyptychus).

He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Ph.D., in 1979 with thesis titled Rinuccini, Peri, Monteverdi, and the humanist heritage of opera. Tomlinson became Director of the Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University, in 2012. Tomlinson's research has ranged across diverse fields, including the history of opera, early-modern European musical thought and practice, the musical cultures of indigenous American societies, and the philosophy of history and critical theory. His latest research concerns music, culture, and human evolution. Here he is concerned to reshape the relations of evolutionary theory, archaeology, and humanistic theory so as to offer a novel model of the emergence of human modernity. The chief ingredients of his model are the niche-construction theory of biologists' extended evolutionary synthesis, a growing systematization of culture evident in the archaeological record, and an extended semiotics indebted to Charles Sanders Peirce.

The producers of the show also don't plan on having the original Jersey Shore group shown unless they come to visit. In addition to the Massachusetts spinoff, Doron Ofir Casting, has also stated that they want to create a Persian themed show in the Los Angeles area. Reaction Vanity Fair Daily has gone as far as calling the show and its twin Persian version fake as they won't either be supported by MTV and are just capitalizing on the success of the popular show. Rumors have been spread over the internet concerning the fact that MTV is supposedly sponsoring the spinoff. This has been denied by both MTV and independent websites. One of the few similarities between the show and Jersey Shore is that they have the same casting director. A Facebook group has even been created protesting the show. The main goal of the group is to protesting the creation of a perceived negative image of Cape Cod.http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100428/NEWS/4280327 ReferencesExternal links * Category:2010s American reality television series ","title":"Wicked Summer"},{"id":"26970560","text":"Villebois is an unconstituted locality (as defined by Statistics Canada in the Canada 2011 Census) within the municipality of Baie-James in the Nord-du- Qu√©bec region of Quebec, Canada.

It is a highly flammable, mobile liquid. It is mainly used as a replacement for THF in specialized applications for its better performance, such as to obtain higher reaction temperatures, or easier separations (as, unlike THF, it is not miscible with water). It is derived from sugars via furfural and is occasionally touted as a biofuel. Structures and properties 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is \\"inversely soluble\\" in water. That is, its solubility decreases with increasing temperature, which is a rare property. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran behaves like tetrahydrofuran as a Lewis base in organometallic reactions. Preparation 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is usually synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of furfural. ref 306 :OC4H3CHO + 4 H2 ‚Üí OC4H7CH3 \\\\+ H2O Furfural is produced by the acid-catalyzed digestion of pentosan sugars, C5 polysaccharides, in biomass. Thus, the raw materials of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran are renewable biomass rich with cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, such as corncobs or bagasse and other plant and agricultural waste. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran can also be produced starting from levulinic acid. Cyclization and reduction gives Œ≥-valerolactone: :File:Cyclization of levulinic acid.svg Œ≥-Valerolactone can be hydrogenated to 1,4-pentanediol, which can then be dehydrated to give 2-methyltetrahydrofuran: :File:Reaction of Valerolactone to 2Me-THF.svg 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is chiral, so it exists in two enantiomeric forms. The commercial processes involving hydrogenation gives a racemic mixture. The asymmetric synthesis of (S)-(+)-2-methyltetrahydrofuran can achieved by using a wool‚Äìrhodium complex as a chiral catalyst for hydrogenation of methyl furan. :200px Applications 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is mainly used as a higher boiling substitute for tetrahydrofuran as a specialty solvent. It also is used in the electrolyte formulation for secondary lithium electrodes and as a component in alternative fuels. It is a valued solvent for low temperature reactions. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran forms a glass, which does not crystallize, and is frequently used as a solvent for spectroscopic studies at ‚àí196 ¬∞C. Other common uses of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran is as a solvent for Grignard reagents used in organometallic and biphasic chemical processes, because of the oxygen atom's ability to coordinate to the magnesium ion component of the Grignard reagent, or to azeotropically dry products. The use of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran provides very clean organic-water phase separations. It is a popular, but costlier substitute for tetrahydrofuran. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is approved by the United States Department of Energy as an additive to gasoline. Furfural and other furyl compounds (furfuryl alcohol, methylfuran, tetrahydrofufuryl alcohol) have a tendency to polymerize and are quite volatile. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran itself, however, is more stable and less volatile, and thus is suitable for use as a motor fuel. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran has been promoted as an ecologically-friendly alternative to THF. Whereas 2-MeTHF is more expensive, it may provide for greater overall process economy. 2-MeTHF has solvating properties that are intermediate between diethyl ether and THF, has limited water miscibility, and forms an azeotrope with water on distillation. Its lower melting point makes it useful for lower temperature reactions, and its higher boiling point allows procedures under reflux at higher temperatures (relative to THF).

Literally, Dub-/Finngaill is translated as \\"dark and fair foreigners\\"Downham (2007), pp. xv‚Äìxviii or \\"black and white foreigners\\",Smyth (1974), p. 101 and similarly, Dub-/Finngenti as \\"dark/black\\" and \\"fair/white heathens\\". Similar terms are found in Welsh chronicles, probably derived from Gaelic usage. The first known use of these terms in the chronicles is from 851, when it is noted that \\"The Dubhghoill arrived in Ath Cliath [Dublin], and made a great slaughter of the Finnghoill\\".AFM 849.9 [=851], similar AU 851.3 \\"Tetact Dubgennti du Ath Cliath co ralsat √°r m√≥r du Fhinngallaibh\\", translated as \\"The dark heathens came to √Åth Cliath, made a great slaughter of the fair-haired foreigners\\" The terms appear, with various spellings, in entries in Irish annals from the 9th and 10th century, and are also used and interpreted in later historiography. There have been different interpretations of the terms. Traditionally, historians have speculated whether these distinctions refer to physical features such as skin or hair-colour, weaponry or outfits. Alfred P. Smyth suggested a new interpretation of dub and finn as \\"new\\" and \\"old\\".Smyth (1974) There is a long tradition of understanding Dubgaill as Danish Vikings and Finngaill as Norwegian Vikings. This interpretation has recently been challenged by David N. Dumville and Clare Downham,Downham (2009), p. 139 note 2 who, building on Smyth's conclusions, propose that the terms may not be related to ethnicity or origin of the different groups of Vikings. Etymology The word Gaill (plural of Gall) etymologically originates from \\"Gauls\\", who in pre-Viking Gaelic history were the archetypal \\"foreigners\\". Dumville says that \\"what [the Gauls] had done in Gaelic prehistory to gain that status is unknown and was probably unpleasant.\\"Dumville (2008), p. 355 During the Viking age, it came to denote Scandinavians or those of Scandinavian descent or speech. From the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, this appellation was passed on to foreigners of French speech and then to the English at large. The word did not denote \\"foreigner\\" in the sense \\"anyone not Irish (Gaelic)\\", but the Saxons, Welsh and Picts are identified as such in the Irish annals, and there are also terms used which may identify the Scandinavians based on nationality, like Dene, Northmanni and Lochlainn.The accuracy of the early references to the homelands of the Scandinavians are controversial, for a thorough discussion on the identification of such terms in insular chronicling with later national entities like Norway and Denmark, see Downham (2009). Another word frequently used by the chroniclers in the early phase of the Viking age was Gen(n)ti, meaning \\"foreigner of a different religion\\". This was derived from the biblical usage of the Latin phrase gentes or gentiles, the latter form common in traditional English translations of the Bible. This terminology was abandoned, which has been taken as recognition of eventual conversion to Christianity. The literary meaning of Old Irish and Old Welsh Dub is normally given as \\"dark\\" or \\"black\\", while Middle Irish finn (Old Irish find, Modern Irish fionn) is given as \\"light\\" or \\"white\\". Smyth, referring to the Dictionary of the Irish Language by the Royal Irish Academy, adds that Dub can mean \\"gloomy\\" or \\"melancholy\\" in a moral sense, and has the intensive meaning of \\"great\\" or \\"mighty\\". For finn there are the additional meanings of \\"handsome\\", \\"just\\" and \\"true\\".Smyth (1974), p. 108 Interpretation history=The meaning of Finn- and Dub- Historians have offered various explanations to account for the fact that terms associated with colour denote two separate factions of Vikings. The explanation which has been most widely accepted is that it either relates to hair-colour or armour.Smyth (1974), pp. 103‚Äì106 The view that it relates to colour was held, for instance, by the Danish antiquary Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae and James Henthorn Todd;Todd (1869), p. xxxi but it also occurs in more modern historical works like in Mac Airt & Mac Niocaill's 1983 edition of Annals of Ulster where Fhinngallaibh is translated \\"fair-haired foreigners\\".AU 851.3 According to Smyth, the most bizarre explanation of the terms was put forward by Jan de Vries. He suggested that the \\"Black foreigners\\" were Moorish slaves, carried off to Ireland in a Viking raid on North Africa. J√≥n Steffensen, while rejecting the fair- and dark-haired hypothesis, suggested that the terms originated from the colours on the shields of the Vikings, the finngaill carrying white shields and the dubgaill red.Steffensen (1970), pp. 59, 77‚Äì78 Alfred Smyth gives arguments against all colour-related distinctions. Referring to Steffensen,Steffensen (1970), p. 59 he dismisses the assumption that \\"any large Scandinavian host could be composed exclusively and over a long period of dark-haired individuals\\" as being unrealistic. As an argument against Steffensen theory of shield-colour, as well as other theories based on colour of armour, he asserts that regular uniform and equipment were unknown in early medieval Germanic armies, and that \\"Norwegian pirates could afford the luxury of carrying nothing but white shields is fanciful to the extreme\\". As a final argument against distinction in colour between Viking factions, Smyth notes that even though these Vikings were active elsewhere, no Anglo-Saxon or Frankish chroniclers have mentioned any particular colour-distinction. Smyth concludes that in this context, finn and dub should not be related to colour or brightness, but must be translated as \\"old\\" and \\"new\\". He finds precedent for this in part on Mageoghagan's translations of the Annals of Clonmacnoise from the early 17th century, where Sihtric (Sigtrygg) C√°ech in his epitaph is called \\"prince of the new & old Danes\\".Smyth (1974), pp 108f. Murphy (1896), p. 148 Norwegians and Danes? The identification of Finngaill as Norwegian and Dubgaill as Danish has had a long tradition, but it was first made long after the terms fell out of contemporary use. According to Smyth, the oldest Irish source that equates the Dub- with Danes is the 12th-century Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, who speaks of \\"Danish Black Gentiles\\" (Duibgeinti Danarda).Smyth (74), p. 102, Todd (1869), p.18-ch.XX, p.229 (trans) Downham points out that the last contemporary use of the terms may be Chronicon Scotorum sub anno 941.CS 941, Downham (2007), p. xvii According to Smyth, medieval Irish writers and later Gaelic antiquaries such as Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and Geoffrey Keating \\"were clear on overall Norwegian origin of the Finn Gaill and the Danish origin of the Dub Gaill\\".Smyth (1974), p. 103 Smyth also states that \\"it is clear from references to Scandinavian activity of the ninth and tenth century within Ireland that the 'White Foreigners' had a predominantly Norwegian origin, and that their opposite number were Danes\\", without giving any further references for this conclusion. Smyth argued that Finn- and Dub- did not imply an ethnic distinction but rather \\"old\\" and \\"new\\", and also pointed out that \\"large viking armies were not exclusively either Danish or Norwegian\\".Smyth (1974), p. 104 He still did not question the identification as Norwegian/Danish. Downham has pointed out that by the time the first sources equating these terms with Norwegian/Danish were written down, changes in Scandinavia had made the Irish aware of a distinction between Norwegians and Danes, a distinction the Irish (or for that matter the \\"Norwegians\\" or \\"Danes\\") would not have been aware of in the middle of the 9th century. Downham argues that a \\"new interpretation was interposed on the earlier terms 'Fair Foreigner' and 'Dark Foreigner'\\". Downham, with reference to a suggestion made by Dumville, offers the alternative interpretation that finngaill and dubgaill identified Viking groups under different leadership. The dubgaill may identify Vikings under the leadership of the U√≠ √çmair, while the finngaill were those \\"old\\" Vikings present in Ireland before the middle of the 9th century. The rivalry between the U√≠ √çmair and other groups persisted long after the U√≠ √çmair had gained control over Dublin, and their hegemony over the Viking settlements in Ireland was established when Amla√≠b mac Gofraid defeated the Vikings of Limerick. After the death of √Åmlaib, the label finngaill fell out of contemporary use in Irish chronicles.Downham (2007), pp. 36‚Äì37, note 141 Imperial style The style King of the Dubgaill and Finngaill (or vice versa) was an imperial one held only by three or four dynasts of the U√≠ √çmair. * Ragnall ua √çmair, the first * Sitric C√°ech, the most celebrated * (Gofraid ua √çmair), styled simply R√≠ Gall (King of the Foreigners) in the surviving sources * Amla√≠b mac Gofraid, his son and the last, styled also King of Ireland in Anglo-Saxon sources See also * Irish nobility References and notes=NotesReferencesBibliography * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Viking Age in Ireland Category:Medieval literature Category:Scandinavian Scotland ","title":"Dubgaill and Finngaill"},{"id":"26970640","text":"For the 1907 infielder of the same name, see Kid Butler (infielder).

The historic island is home to two public parks and a water treatment facility. It is connected to the mainland by a steel deck Rolling bascule bridge.https://buffaloah.com/a/water/ferry/ Ferry Street Lift Bridge The island's original name in the Seneca language is Deyowenoguhdoh. From about the time of the War of 1812 to July 2015, the island was also known by the English name, Squaw Island. In June 2015, after being petitioned by Jodi Lynn Maracle, a Mohawk resident of Buffalo, and members of the Seneca Nation of New York, who considered the name to be racist and derogatory toward Native American women, the members of the Buffalo Common Council voted unanimously to change the island's name to Unity Island. The new name was formally adopted by the city in October 2015, with new signs reflecting the name change were installed on the island; the U.S. Board on Geographic Names recognized the new name in May 2017.  History =Early history The Seneca people acquired Unity Island and the surrounding areas in the 1650s. They called it Deyowenoguhdoh, meaning \\"divided island\\", so-called for a small marshy creek (then known as \\"Smuggler's Run\\") that once ran through the property. The name Squaw Island first appeared prior to the War of 1812; however, its origin is unknown. Not until the early 19th century did the island leave the hands of the Seneca Nation. Philip Kenjockety, one of the last of the Neutral Nation and namesake of Scajaquada Creek, owned a corn field on the island at the time of his death in 1808. Kenjockety is known to have traveled the creek that once divided the island by canoe during his travels to and from Canada. HMS Detroit On October 9, 1812, , a six-gun brig of the Royal Navy, became grounded on the island and was captured by American naval forces on the waters of Lake Erie at Fort Erie during the War of 1812. Light winds and swift waters at the mouth of the Niagara River made it impossible for the Americans to escape British artillery at nearby Fort Erie. After a fierce exchange of gunfire and the exhaustion of American ammunition, the ship was left to the river's current before reaching her unplanned final destination on the island, within range of both British and American batteries. Both the British and Americans contested the grounded Detroit until her battered hulk was set afire and burned by American forces. The island remained in the hands of the Senecas until 1816, when the Nation gifted the property to Captain Jasper Parrish for his service to them as an agent and interpreter. Parrish later sold the island to local attorney Henry F. Penfield in 1823.  Current use  In later years, Unity Island came into public ownership and its northern end was used as a landfill; the area was eventually capped and turned into today's Unity Island Park. A City of Buffalo water treatment facility began operations on the island in 1938. The facility's construction slightly expanded the size of the island. Broderick Park At the southern tip of Unity Island is Broderick Park, the location of the former Black Rock ferry, a major transportation link across the Niagara River between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario. The ferry operated continuously at that location between 1825 and the middle of the 20th century, when service was discontinued. The ferry's dock along the western edge of the park was used as an Underground Railroad station from at least the 1830s until the American Civil War. Escaped slaves that arrived at the park would take the ferry and other boats from this location across the Niagara River to Canada, thus securing their freedom. Bird Island An 1829 map illustrating a proposed harbor on the Niagara River, showing the locations of Bird Island and Unity Island Extending from the southern tip of Unity Island is a long, narrow stone pier known as Bird Island Pier, completed in 1860. The structure once connected Unity Island to the former Bird Island, a small land formation, rocky on its southern end with fertile soil to the north. Kenjockety's father cultivated corn there. The island was noted in the personal journal of DeWitt Clinton, who surveyed the area prior to construction of the Erie Canal. An 1829 map of the Niagara River and proposed Black Rock Harbor illustrates the then-proposed Bird Island Pier connecting Unity Island to Bird Island. By 1880, however, Bird Island had disappeared, the rock which composed it having been used to construct the Black Rock Pier to support the Erie Canal.

A pre-war student of Japanese, Biard's translation work is considered to have been an important part of American military success. Early life and education Biard graduated from North Dallas High School in 1930 and from the United States Naval Academy in 1934. He served as an ensign on the heavy cruiser from 1935 to 1937. Biard was sent to Tokyo in 1939 for full immersion Japanese language and culture training. His planned three-year assignment was cut short in September 1941 due to the rising tensions between Japan and the United States. Biard later earned a master's degree in physics from the Ohio State University in 1953.Maffeo, p. 215. Retrieved 2020-02-08. World War II service In September 1941, Biard (then a Lieutenant) was stationed at Pearl Harbor as a senior linguist for Station HYPO, part of American attempts to break Japanese military codes, including the key strategic code, JN-25. In February 1942, he was temporarily assigned to the as the radio intelligence officer under Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. His translation and decryption work on JN-25 contributed substantially to Allied efforts in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on March 1, 1943. Biard was promoted to Commander on February 1, 1944. He then worked with Tom Mackie to decrypt and translate captured Japanese Army code books for Douglas MacArthur; MacArthur was able to use Biard and Mackie's data to accelerate his \\"island-hopping\\" strategy to liberate New Guinea and hasten the end of the war. Postwar career In 1946, Biard served as Executive Officer in the Intelligence Division and Chief of the Security Section for Operation Crossroads, the first nuclear weapons tests conducted by Joint Army/Navy Task Force One at Bikini Atoll. Biard retired from the U.S. Navy in January 1955 and received a promotion to Captain based on his wartime service record. After retirement, he taught Physics at Long Beach City College.

There they are captured by the queen (Chiemi Akimoto) of a lesbian colony who uses the two lovers for her own sex games. The couple organize a revolt against the queen.

Background Tomoaki Hosoyama filmed Lesbian Harem for Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga and it was released theatrically in Japan by that studio on April 18, 1987. U.S. low-budget exploitation films had become popular in Japan with the advent of home video. Director Hosoyama made Lesbian Harem on a similarly low budget, and designed the film as a tribute to these films, and particularly as an homage to John Waters' Desperate Living (1977). In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser give Lesbian Harem three out of four stars. Noting that Lesbian Harem is an important film on its own, they point out that in many ways this early Hosoyama film also anticipates his later hit, Weather Girl (1993). Hosoyama's attitude towards lesbianism, in particular, is shared between these films, and in direct opposition to the way it was depicted in most contemporary pink films dealing with the subject. Rather than showing lesbians as women who are bitter from bad experiences with heterosexual affairs, and who are victims of a disapproving society, Hosoyama shows lesbianism simply as a lifestyle which the storyline accepts without judgment.

From 1853 to 1856, he was the director of the Od√©on Theatre and from 1856 to 1862 director of the Paris Op√©ra, after which he was appointed France's Inspecteur G√©n√©ral des Beaux-Arts (Inspector General for the Fine Arts). In his later years, he wrote a six volume history of the theatre and a history of the Paris Op√©ra. He also translated the theatrical works of the Italian dramatist Carlo Gozzi, as well those of the Spanish writers, Miguel de Cervantes, Tirso de Molina, and Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. A Chevalier and later Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur, Royer died in Paris, the city of his birth, at the age of 71. Biography=Early years and first success Alphonse Royer was born in Paris to a prosperous family with various commercial interests. His father was a commissaire-priseur (auctioneer) and lawyer. As a young man, Royer belonged to a literary circle inspired by Romanticism and Liberalism, movements for which he maintained a sympathy throughout his life.Vapereau (1880) p. 1588La Presse (13 April 1875) p. 2 He initially trained to be a lawyer, but was more interested in poetry and the theatre and longed to travel.Va√´z (1840) His father sent him abroad where for several years he travelled in Italy and the Middle East, and carried out several minor diplomatic and business missions. Royer was in Constantinople during the 1826 revolt of the Janissaries against Mahmud II and later wrote an account of it in his 1844 novel, Les janissaires. His experiences during those years also served as the inspirations for several other works, including his novels Venezia la bella (1834) and Robert Macaire en Orient (1840) and a collection of novellas, Un Divan (1834). On his return to Paris, Royer made his literary debut with a novel set in the Middle Ages, Les Mauvais Gar√ßons, which he co-authored with Henri Auguste Barbier. It was published in 1830, the same year as his first venture into drama, Henry V et ses compagnons, co-authored with Auguste Romieu. The play premiered to great success at the Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s on 27 February 1830 with incidental music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Carl Maria von Weber, and Louis Spohr. Librettist and playwright Gustave Va√´z In the ensuing years, Royer wrote several more novels and plays, contributed articles to a variety of Parisian periodicals, and formed a close friendship and working partnership with the Belgian playwright and poet, Gustave Va√´z. Their first major collaboration was the translation and adaptation of Donizetti's opera, Lucia di Lammermoor for the French stage. The successful premiere of Lucie de Lammermoor, at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance in 1839 led to several similar commissions, as well as commissions for original librettos, most notably Donizetti's La favorite (1840), and Verdi's J√©rusalem (1847). During the period of the July Monarchy, Royer and Va√´z became a major force in the adaptation of Italian operas for French audiences and had a virtual monopoly of the Italian repertoire at the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique. They always worked closely with the composers and were praised for the way their writing respected the movement and rhythm of the music. In the case of translated librettos, this was made all the more difficult by having to adapt their poetry to a pre-existing score intended to be sung in another language.Everist (2009) pp. 31 and 35 An anonymous critic in L'Illustration wrote of their translation for Rossini's Otello: > By virtue of work and skill, MM. Royer and Va√´z have forced our language, so > cold and so unmalleable, so constrained by consonants, so loaded with > epithets, to enter without too many cuts and bruises into this narrow and > flexible mode of Italian poetry.Quoted in Everist (2009) p. 35 Although their collaboration on the Italian operatic repertoire ended in 1847 with J√©rusalem, they later wrote the original libretto for Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert's 1853 op√©ra comique, Georgette ou Le moulin de Fontenoy. In addition to their work on opera librettos, Royer and Va√´z co-wrote many plays, ranging from serious drama to com√©die en vaudeville, several of which premiered at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on. During this period, Royer had also achieved a minor reputation as an orientalist, partly though his novels and travel writing which were widely read at the time, but also through his biography of Mahmud II and his articles on Mahmud's legislative reforms for the legal journal, Gazette des tribunaux. He held salons at his apartment in the Rue de Navarin, attended by literary figures, artists, composers and journalists, all of whom were close friends. According to Xavier Eyma,Louis Xavier Eyma (1816-1876) was French author and diplomat born in Martinique. who attended the salons at that time, they resembled a \\"miniature divan in Constantinople\\", with Turkish tobacco smoked on traditional Turkish pipes and Turkish coffee consumed in tiny cups.Eyma (1866) p. 220 Amongst Royer's circle of friends at this time, in addition to Barbier and Va√´z, were Alphonse Karr, Camille Rogier (who travelled with Royer to Constantinople in 1840),Camille Rogier (1810-1896) was French artist, most known for his depictions of life in Turkey, but also for his illustrations of E. T. A. Hoffmann's stories. See Schreier (2006) especially pp. 75-77. Joseph M√©ry, Balzac, G√©rard de Nerval, Th√©ophile Gautier and Heinrich Heine. Heine, Gautier and Royer had a particularly close friendship. At several points they all lived near each other on the Rue de Navarin, at times sharing the same lodging. Royer and Gautier and their mistresses were also frequent visitors to Heine's summer house in Montmorency. In 1841, Gautier and Royer were Heine's seconds in his duel with Salomon Strauss which had involved them in lengthy negotiations with Strauss over the time, place and weapons.Claveau (1867) p. 749. Strauss had challenged Heine to a duel after he had published scandalous accusations of a m√©nage √† trois involving Strauss, Strauss' wife, Jeanette Wohl, and the poet Ludwig B√∂rne. Strauss had wanted a duel with swords, while Heine wanted pistols. In the end, pistols were chosen, and the duel took place on 7 September 1841 in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Heine shot into the air. Strauss's shot gave Heine a slight wound on the hip. For an account in English of the duel and the events surrounding it, see Holub (1989) pp. 145-156. Several of Royer and Gautier's letters to Strauss' representatives concerning arrangements for the duel are published in Gautier (1985) They were also the witnesses at Heine's marriage to his long-time mistress, Mathilde, which took place a week before the duel.Fejt≈ë (1946) p. 205 Theatre manager Nadar ca. 1857) Royer had been spoken of as a possible successor to Vedel,Vedel was the stage name of Alexandre-Furcy Poulet (1783-1873) the director of Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, who resigned his post in 1840. In suggesting him for the directorship, La Presse wrote: > ... M. Alphonse Royer, a man of taste, tact and charming demeanor. The > government would find in him an experienced and skilful supporter and an > enlightened defender of our great literary traditions.La Presse (2 January > 1840) p. 2. Original French: \\"M. Alphonse Royer, homme de go√ªt, de tact, et > de rotations charmantes. Le gouvernement trouverait en lui un partisan > √©prouv√© des jet√©es d'ordre, et l'art un d√©fenseur √©clair√© de nos grandes > traditions litt√©raires.\\" In the end, Vedel was succeeded by Fran√ßois Buloz. However, in 1853 Royer was appointed director of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, where several of his plays had premiered in the 1840s. Va√´z joined him at the Od√©on as a stage and artistic director and then went with him to the Paris Op√©ra in 1856 when Royer became the director there. During Royer's tenure, the Op√©ra produced the world premieres of operas by Giuseppe Verdi (Le trouv√®re, the French version of Il trovatore), Fromental Hal√©vy (La Magicienne), F√©licien David (Herculanum), Prince Poniatowski (Pierre de M√©dicis), and Charles Gounod (La reine de Saba) as well as ballets by Ernest Reyer (Sacountal√¢), Daniel Auber (Marco Spada), and Jacques Offenbach (Le papillon). Managing an opera house in Paris during the Second French Empire often meant managing the audience as well. On one notable occasion, Royer did not succeed. Napoleon III had ordered a performance of Wagner's Tannh√§user at the Op√©ra which was to be its French premiere. Royer told the composer that for the opera to have any success with Parisian audiences, it required the customary ballet, specifically at the beginning of the second act. Royer explained that the influential members of the Jockey-Club de Paris (all of whom held season tickets) were primarily interested in watching their favourites in the corps de ballet. They usually dined during the first act of operas, only entered their boxes when the second act began to watch the ballet, and departed immediately afterwards. Wagner adamantly refused to add a ballet to the second act, but compromised by adding one to the first act.Norton (2004) pp. 241-242 The result was the famous fiasco of the \\"Paris Tannh√§user\\". On its opening night in 1861, the Jockey Club members duly arrived at the beginning of Act 2 and caused an uproar of shouts, whistles and laughter. Wagner recalled that when the whistling began, Royer turned to him in complete resignation and said, \\"Ce sont les Jockeys; nous sommes perdus.\\" (\\"It's the Jockeys; we're lost.\\")Wagner (1911) p. 765 The two successive performances were even more seriously disrupted. Wagner never permitted another production in Paris. In his autobiography, Wagner described Royer in one of their early encounters: > On one of these occasions Bulow accompanied me, and we were both struck by a > ridiculous habit peculiar to this singular old man, whom BelloniGaetano > Belloni (1810-1887) was Franz Liszt's secretary and agent. said he had known > in his youth as a box-office clerk at the Scala Theatre in Milan. He > suffered from involuntary spasmodic movements of the hands, the result of > certain not very creditable physical infirmities, and probably to conceal > these he continually toyed with a small stick, which he tossed to and fro > with seeming affectation.Wagner (1911) p. 735 Later years P√®re Lachaise Cemetery with Paris in the distance Royer remained director of the Paris Op√©ra until Va√´z's death in 1862, after which he left to become France's Inspecteur G√©n√©ral des Beaux-Arts (Inspector General for the Fine Arts). In his later years, he devoted himself to writing a six volume history of the theatre (the last two volumes of which were published posthumously) and a history of the Paris Op√©ra. He also translated the collected theatrical works of the Italian dramatist Carlo Gozzi, as well those of the Spanish writers, Miguel de Cervantes, Tirso de Molina, and Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. Royer's 1865 Th√©√¢tre d'Alarc√≥n was the first time any of Alarc√≥n's plays had been published in French translation.See Douhair (1865) p. 224 and Royer (1865) p. 1 He had been made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1844, and in 1867 was promoted to Officier. Alphonse Royer died of pneumonia in Paris on 11 April 1875 at the age of 71. His funeral took place at the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√©, followed by burial in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Jean-Baptiste Faure sang the Pie Jesu during the Requiem Mass,Faure had composed the Pie Jesu himself, originally for the funeral of his teacher, the tenor Louis Antoine Ponchard (1787-1866). and there were spoken tributes by Olivier Halanzier, director of the Paris Op√©ra, Ferdinand Dugne of the Soci√©t√© des auteurs dramatiques, and Emmanuel Gonzal√®s of the Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres. Halanzier's address at the graveside emphasized Royer's personal modesty and kindness and his contribution to opera and to the Paris Op√©ra in particular, concluding with: > This is why his memory will live on with us. This is why his memory will be > always dear to the Op√©ra. Finally, gentlemen, why all of you share my words, > my regrets, my tears!Le M√©nestrel (18 April 1875) pp. 155-156. Original > quote in French: \\"Voil√† pourquoi sa m√©moire vivra parmi nous, voil√† pourquoi > son souvenir sera toujours cher √† l'Op√©ra, pourquoi enfin, Messieurs, vous > tous qui m'entourez, vous vous associez √† mes paroles, √† mes regrets, √† mes > larmes!\\" Little has been written about Royer's personal life, although Fritz H.

When completed, it will be the largest power- generating installation in the country. Location The power station is located at Karuma Falls on the Victoria Nile, at the former location of the Karuma Falls. This location is approximately upstream of where the Masindi- Gulu Highway crosses the Nile. By road, it is approximately northeast of Masindi and south of Gulu. The geographical coordinates of Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station are:02¬∞14'51.0\\"N, 32¬∞16'05.0\\"E (Latitude:2.247500; Longitude:32.268056). The electrical-mechanical installations of the power station are located approximately underground, with of underground access roads, making Karuma, the 14th largest underground power station in the world. History As far back as 1995, the government of Uganda planned to construct a hydropower station at the site of the Karuma Falls. Initially, Norpak, a Norwegian energy company, was awarded the contract to perform the feasibility study and the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the dam. The World Bank promised to make a loan available to pay for the construction. The feasibility study report was made available in October 2006. Bids for construction of the project went out in November 2006. Initially, the plan was to build a 200-250 megawatt power station. In 2009, the plans were redrawn, calling for a much larger project of 750 megawatts. Sometime during 2009, Norpak pulled out of the negotiations with the Ugandan government, citing the Global Recession of 2008 to 2012. The Ugandan government then contracted with Energy Infratech Private Limited to perform a new feasibility study and a new EIA, given that a larger power station was now being planned. At that time, construction was expected to start in 2012 and last six years. In July 2011, media reports indicated that the maximum capacity of the project had been scaled back to 600 megawatts from 750 megawatts. Some international development partners wanted to scale back even further, to a maximum capacity of 400 to 450 megawatts. Technical specifications Karuma Power Station comprises a roller compacted concrete gravity dam, that measures high and long. There are six water intake towers, each measuring high and wide. The underground chamber housing the six vertical Francis turbines of 100MW each, measures long, wide, and high. Construction costs In January 2011, Energy Infratech Private Limited, the Indian company contracted to perform the feasibility study for the project, said the estimated total cost for the dam and power plant was approximately US $2.2 billion. That figure included the cost needed to build a transmission line from Karuma to a location where the power will be integrated into the national power grid. The power generated will be transmitted via high voltage wires to three substations as follows: (a) a 400 kilovolt line to Kawanda UETCL Substation in Wakiso District (b) an 132 kilovolt line to Lira and (c) a 400 kilovolt line to a substation in Olwiyo, Nwoya District. The construction costs for the high voltage transmission lines are estimated at US$250 million. In June 2013, the Ugandan government awarded the construction contract to Sinohydro, a Chinese construction company. Work began in the second half of 2013 and is expected to last five years. Construction costs will be jointly funded by the Ugandan and Chinese governments. In June 2014, the Exim Bank of China committed in writing to fund 85 percent of the construction costs, in the form of a concessionary loan repayable in five years. The Ugandan government will fund the remaining 15 percent of the cost. In March 2015, the Ugandan Parliament assented to two loans totalling US$1.435 billion, from the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China, for the construction of the power station. Of that amount, US$789.3 million will be loaned at 2 percent per annum, repayable over 20 years, while US$645.82 million will attract 4 percent interest, payable over 15 years, effective the day the dam is fully commissioned. Uganda has already invested US$253.26 million to start the construction. That brings the total funds committed to the project as, of March 2015, to US $1,688,380,000. As of June 2018, with approximately 76 percent of the work completed, the total construction budget was quoted at US$1.7 billion, with US$1.4 billion for construction of the power station, and US$300 million going towards the new transmission lines and new substations. Construction work Gulu Highway construction near Karuma dam. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on 12 August 2013. In March 2015, Sinohydro, the lead contractor on the project, contracted with Alstom to provide equipment and technical services to the power station, in a deal worth US$65 million. The equipment includes six 100 megawatt Francis turbines and related equipment. At the peak of construction, it is expected that a total of 2,500 casual and permanent workers will be hired. The power station is expected to be commissioned in 2018. As of March 2016, about 30 percent of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. In February 2018, the Red Pepper Newspaper reported that work equivalent to 74 percent of the entire project had been completed and commissioning of the power station was expected in December 2018. As of June 2018, fifty-six months since the beginning of construction, an estimated 76 percent of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 are Ugandan. The first 200 MW of power are expected online in December 2018, and the rest in 2019. Each unit of power is expected to cost the consumer US$0.049 for the first 10 years of the life of the power station, after which the price will drop down to US$0.020 per unit, for the next 15 years. Three new substations, one each at Karuma, Kawanda and Olwiyo, are part of the construction contract. The substation at Lira will also undergo an upgrade to accommodate power from Karuma. As of April 2019, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported that the work on the power station was approximately 80 percent complete, while the three high voltage transmission lines were 80 to 85 percent complete. Commissioning of the completed power station is expected in December 2019. In September 2019, an estimated 95 percent of construction had been completed. This included 100 percent completion of the Karuma‚ÄìLira High Voltage Line, 100 percent of the Karuma‚ÄìKawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98 percent of the Karuma‚ÄìOlwiyo High Voltage Line. Commissioning of the power station is planned for December 2019. Recent developments In addition to the high voltage transmission lines to Lira, Olwiyo and Kawanda, that belong to Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), Umeme, the largest national distributor will spend USh4 billion (US$1.1 million) to construct a network of 33kV lines from Karuma to Kigumba and on to the districts of Lira, Gulu, Masindi and Hoima. Commissioning of the power station has been moved to November 2020.

Location The 132 kilovolt power line would start at the 132 kV Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) substation at Lira. The line would travel in a general northeast direction to the city of Gulu, approximately away, by road. From Gulu, the power line would travel in a general easterly direction for about , to end at Agago. The total distance traveled by the power line is estimated at approximately , since the line does not follow the road all the time. Overview This power line is intended to distribute electricity generated from power stations on the Victoria Nile to the Northern Region of Uganda. It is also intended to evacuate power from the Achwa Hydroelectricity Power Station Complex, including Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station, under construction as of January 2018, and Achwa 3 Hydroelectric Power Station, under development. The main objective is to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of electricity supplied to the region. Construction As of June 2017, the website of the Electricity Regulatory Authority, stated that (a) preparation for implementation of the population resettlement plan were underway, (b) the updated feasibility study was in its final stages, (c) the pre-qualification of the contractors was ongoing and (d) the tender evaluation had been concluded. The scope of work involves the construction of a new 132kV electricity substation at Agago. In January 2016, the German government committed to lend ‚Ç¨40 million, on soft terms, towards the construction of this power line.

The Council began by reaffirming that Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (known as Sector East) were integral parts of Croatia and that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms was important. Support was given to the Basic Agreement was signed on 12 November 1995 between the Government of Croatia and local Serbs. In the aftermath of the Operation Storm resolution called upon parties to \\"refrain from any unilateral actions\\". It was important that all countries in the former Yugoslavia recognised each other. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, it was decided that UNTAES would operate in the three regions for an initial period of a year with both military and civilian components. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was asked to appoint a director. Demilitarisation would be complete within 30 days after the deployment of the military component of UNTAES. 14 days after the date on which demilitarisation was to be completed, a review would take place on the willingness of the parties to implement the Basic Agreement. If the Secretary- General reported that the parties were not meeting their obligations, it would review the mandate of UNTAES. He was also requested to report to the Council by 15 December 1996 on UNTAES and the implementation of the Basic Agreement. The Security Council that the military component of UNTAES would consist of an initial force of up to 5,000 personnel with the following mandate: :(a) monitor and assist in demobilisation, complete by 20 June 1996; :(b) oversee the return of refugees and displaced persons; :(c) contribute to peace in the region by its presence; :(d) help with the implementation of the Basic Agreement. It was also decided that the civilian component would have the following mandate: :(a) establish a temporary police force by July 1996 of around 600 personnel and oversee the prison system; :(b) undertake tasks relating to civil administration; :(c) undertake tasks relating to the public services; :(d) support the return of refugees; :(e) verify and organise elections for April 1997; :(f) undertake other tasks, such as economic reconstruction. UNTAES would monitor compliance of the parties with the agreement, respect for human rights and promote an atmosphere of confidence. Member States were also authorised to provide air support to protect UNTAES. It was requested that UNTAES co-operate with the Implementation Force authorised in Resolution 1031 (1995) and for all states to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia established in Resolution 827 (1993). Finally, the resolution concluded by asking the Secretary-General to consider ways in which Croatia could contribute to the cost of UNTAES.

Phyllis n√©e Slater, was born in 1924, the daughter of Arthur Slater. She was one of only two women who graduated as architects from the University of Melbourne in 1949, having topped her fourth year in 1948. Following the completion of their studies in Architecture, the two collaborated and set up a private practice of their own, a year before they married in 1950. After the success of the 1956 Olympic pool design, with colleagues Kevin Borland, Peter McIntyre and engineer Bill Erwin, the couple's business turned to residential commissions, but soon grew to involve the design of commercial and school buildings. Of their early residential work, Phyllis Murphy has written; \\"we started our architectural practice when there were severe shortages of building materials, manpower and finance... Despite these restraints, the immediate post-war period was marked by optimism and resilience... The houses we designed were influenced by a... visit to Sweden where living spaces were small but the buildings had a simplicity that we found fresh and elegant.\\"Doug Evans (ed) Architect Victoria, p.12-13 Contributed by Phyllis Murphy.

The territory was home to the former RCAF Station Mont Apica, located along Quebec Route 169 at the base of the namesake Mount Apica. Part of the Pinetree Line and NORAD, the station became operational in 1952 and had a staff of some 500 persons at its peak. Political and technological changes made the station redundant and it closed in 1990. The Apica River, a small tributary of the Pikauba River, flows through the territory in a narrow and deep valley at the foot of the high Mount Apica.

This genus was previously placed in the subfamily Crassispirinae, within the Turridae. Description (Description by W.H. Dall as a subgenus of Carinodrillia) This genus consists of moderate-sized, rather heavy shelled mollusks which resemble the members of the genus Carinodrillia. They differ from Carinodrillia in having the whorls of the protoconch without a median carina. Here they are rounded, the early whorls smooth, succeeded by a finely axially, closely lirate portion that passes into an axially slender ribbed part, which in turn passes into the postnuclear sculpture. The sculpture of the postnuclear whorls consists of strong axial ribs which weaken on the posterior sinus. The axial ribs and intercostal spaces are crossed by rather heavy spiral cords, finer spiral lirations between the heavier cords, and hairlike incremental lines. The combination of these last two elements produces a fine clothlike pattern, while their junction sometimes almost appears granulose. The columella is stout, and there is a weak umbilical chink at its anterior termination. The aperture is rather short, deeply channeled anteriorly and posteriorly, the posterior sinus falling a little anterior to the summit. The outer lip is protracted into a clawlike element between the anterior limit of the posterior sinus and the stromboid notch.Bartsch, P.

The two school buildings, located on the original property at the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and Alexandria Street, were the first African-American related structures in southwestern Louisiana to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, on March 1, 1996. Teachers Teacher preparation was an important goal of the Beauregard Parish Training School from its founding until the mid-1930s when the program was discontinued. Subsequently, students were required to attend one or two years at a normal school in order to obtain a teaching certificate. The parish training school movement for training black teachers began in 1911. By school year 1919-1920 Beauregard Parish Training School became one of 107 Training schools in the South. The curriculum included regular courses such as math, science, and English, as well as instruction in how to teach. Although each student completing the teaching program was awarded a certificate stating that he or she was qualified to teach at the elementary level in black schools, it was necessary for each to pass a test given by the state Department of Education before that certification was considered valid. After the teaching program was discontinued in the mid-1930s, students were required to attend one or two years at a normal school in order to obtain a teaching certificate. The school curriculum offered and its teachers were highly valued by the black citizens of Beauregard Parish. Description The 1929 building's massing is that of a rectangle beneath a low, slightly overhanging tripped roof. This roof is broken by a low pediment-like gable on the facade, by gablets on each end, and by three tall chimneys. The smooth walls are pierced by bands of windows with concrete sills, on the front and rear. The entrance, which features sidelights, is located at the rear of a small vestibule whose door-less opening is distinguished by a bracketed cornice. The vestibule and entrance are located in the center of the facade within a bay which projects from the rest of the building about 4 inches. A small wing is attached to the northwest corner of the structure. The interior originally consisted of five classrooms organized around an \\"L\\" shaped hallway. Each room had a high ceiling, plaster walls, and a door with a six-light transom above. With . The 1938 one story brick building has a T shape footprint. Two large classrooms with a lobby in between take up the front portion of the building, while a gymnasium is provided for in the rear wing. The building features a series of paired windows on both the classroom and gym sections. The end allows the gym to double as an auditorium. Rosenwald School The Beauregard Parish Training School would be considered a Rosenwald School. Funds of $500.00 was given to the parish to assist in building a school by the Rosenwald Fund. Rosenwald Database In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Rosenwald Schools near the top of the country's most endangered places and created a campaign to raise awareness and money for preservation. History The concept of the parish training school created in 1911 was made possible through the efforts of four philanthropic foundations interested in the education of African-American youth. These foundations - the General Education Board, the John F. Slater Fund, and Anna T. Jeanes Fund, and the Rosenwald Fund, convinced state education officials throughout the South to work with them to improve educational opportunities for blacks. The training school movement had several goals. The first was to provide each parish with a central public school for blacks. With its good physical facilities and carefully chosen curriculum, this school would serve as a model for other black schools in the area. Another goal was to provide a more thorough education by offering more courses. Thus, students could attend a training school two or three years longer than they could one of their smaller rural cousins. Early in the movement training schools offered at least eight grades; later they offered ten or eleven. A third goal was to provide industrial and manual training for African-American children,\\"..laying particular emphasis upon subject pertaining to home and farm.\\" The final goal of the parish training school movement was to prepare teachers who would then serve in the region's rural black elementary schools. The first training school in the nation opened in Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish in 1911. One of the reasons the training school concept worked was because the General Education Board placed agents within the state education departments and, in some cases, within the parishes themselves. In order to obtain a training school, parishes had to own the property where the building would be erected, recognize the school as part of the public school system, and commit at least $750 from public funds toward its maintenance each year. Beauregard Parish met the first requirement when the Longbell Lumber Company conveyed a tract of land to the School Board on February 6, 1917. However, the parish did not receive its first \\"Supervisory Agent for Negroes\\" until July 3, 1919. This person's primary tasks were to assist teachers in writing lesson plans and to create support for black schools. The Beauregard Parish Training School opened in 1920 with a physical plant consisting of two buildings. A large two-story structure served as a high school while a smaller one-story building held the elementary level classes. Schools for African-American students had existed in the Beauregard Parish towns of Merryville, Ludington, Bon Ami, Carson, Longville, Center Hill, Bancroft and DeRidder at least as early as the 1917-1918 term. Although attendance figures for each year are not available, those for the 1923-1924 nine month indicate that an average of 420 students attended the school with as many as 450 having attended at one time. Average daily attendance was around 318 children. State Board of Education records indicate that 19 of the Training School's students boarded within the DeRidder community during that school year. George Washington Carver High School In 1953 the R.H. Crosby family donated a school building to Buaregard Parish to relieve crowding at the training school. This became known as George Washington Carver High School and remained in operation until the public schools were integrated in 1970. Fire and current buildings The original elementary and high school buildings were destroyed by a fire of unknown origin in 1929. Bids for replacement buildings were opened on July 23, 1929, with the contract awarded to P. Olivier & Son for $20,300. This amount underwrote the construction of twin, one-story, hollow tile buildings with stuccoed exterior surfaces. The State Board of Education annual report for 1930-31 shows that each of these buildings contained five classrooms. Part of the curriculum at that time : reading, writing, and math (grades 2-3); history and geography (grade 4); English, history and literature (grade 7) and algebra and geometry (the high school grades). Education Institutions like the Beauregard Training School was the beginning of a new era for Black citizens of this country. Ethnic heritage The obvious importance to the black citizens of this country has not been lost. Historical importance The Beauregard Parish Training School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1996. Unveiling of a Plaque designating the Beauregard Parish Training School as a Historical Landmark occurred November 16, 2001. One of the twin classroom buildings constructed in 1929 was destroyed by another fire during the mid-1930s. Instead of replacing it with a similar building, the school board elected to construct a combination classroom building/gymnasium on the site. It was completed in 1938. Both the 1929 and 1938 buildings continued to be used as educational facilities well into the post-World War II period - as the Beauregard Parish Training School until c. 1941 and as a regular public school after that date. During the historic period (1929‚Äì1945), and into the postwar era, the school was the only opportunity in the parish for blacks to receive a high school education. The large rural parish had a population of 14,847 in 1940, one-fifth of which was black. The parish seat of DeRidder was the only town of any size. A 1948 government document notes that there were in that year eight high schools and eight elementary schools for whites and one high school and two elementary schools for blacks. Current Both buildings are now used as part of BeauCARE Head Start educational program for early childhood education.

Mendels, Jr. (1850-1911) was an American businessman and broker. He was a leading curbstone broker who organized the Curb Market Agency in 1908 that developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers. Later he formed the New York Curb Market Association, which supervised curb trading in an effort to prevent fraud. The New York Times called him the \\"father of the curb, writing \\"he, perhaps more than any other man, worked for the elevation of business done on the [New York curb market].\\" Early life Emanuel S. Mendels, Jr. was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1850. His father, who had a small business was also active in Whig politics. After his parents moved to New Jersey, Mendels was employed at a brokerage house during the post war boom period. Career=Work as secretary and broker Early in life, Mendels worked as a business secretary. He spent much of his time on the street doing business and became known as a \\"curb\\" broker, \\"one through whom all routine business of the market could be transacted.\\" After four years of working in the brokerage firm, he left his position to be a full-time curbstone broker in Manhattan. He first became actively involved in the curb market in 1874. He became the recognized \\"proctor\\" of the curb, and he alone would decide on the quotation lists. He also used his influence to throw out fraudulent stocks and dishonest brokers. The curb market moved to Broad Street near Exchange Place in the 1890s. In 1904, Mendels began to actively attempt to organize the curb to reduce swindling and valueless stocks. Around 1895, Mendels began promoting the idea of the moving the market indoors which wouldn't be actively picked up for two more decades. Work as Curb agent In the mining boom of 1905 and 1906, the Curb market attracted some negative publicity for the \\"wholesale use of the Curb for swindling.\\" Around late 1907, Mendels began devoting most of his time to keeping the Curb market \\"free of swindling stocks.\\" In 1908, Mendels organized the Curb Market Agency that developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers. As of February 1909, Mendels was \\"Curb agent,\\" meaning that he was essentially the only authority figure in the unorganized curb market on Broad Street. On February 26, 1909, he gave a \\"very complete and satisfactory\\" testimony to the Wall Street Investigating Committee on how the curb brokers conducted business under his authority. He also gave testimony on the restrictions concerning new business and explained the rules that dealt with swindlers. On November 10, 1909, Mendels issued a notice reading, \\"For the protection of the public, complaints made in writing against any corporation or individual using the New York Curb market, directly or indirectly, will be investigated by the agency and referred to the proper authorities for suitable action.\\" At the time, the Curb market still had no official organization. In 1910, he again testified before the Wall Street Investigating Committee on behalf of the curb brokers when an attempt was made to remove them from doing business on Broad Street. Curb Association formation In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Agency, which can be considered as the first formal constitution of the American Stock Exchange, today known as the NYSE Amex Equities.http://abcnewspapers.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=11281New York Curb Market Association On March 16, 1911, the Curb Association elected its first Board of Representatives. The board corresponded to the Governing Committee of the Stock Exchange and had the \\"task of keeping the outside market in order.\\" Members included E. S. Mendels and fifteen others. Upon his death on October 17, 1911, The New York Times called him the \\"Father of the Curb.\\" The quotation from the Times read, \\"he, perhaps more than any other man, worked for the elevation of business done on the Curb.\\" Personal life Mendel married Bertha Rothschild of Philadelphia.

The Council noted an agreement whereby presidents of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) concerning demilitarisation and emphasised the contribution this had made to the decrease in tension in the region. The observers would monitor the demilitarisation in the Prevlaka peninsula for a period of three months, and the Council would extend this period by a further three months upon receipt of a report by the Secretary-General. By 15 March 1996, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report to the Council on the situation in the region and progress made by the parties to resolve their differences and with regard to the possible extension of the mandate of the military observers.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Spain. A royal decree of September 12, 1861 established the F√°brica del Sello as the exclusive printer of Spanish stamps. In 1893 the F√°brica del Sello merged with the Casa de la Moneda to form the La F√°brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre (FNMT) which has printed the stamps of Spain and her dependencies ever since, except during the Third Carlist War and the Spanish Civil War when concurrent issues were authorized by competing sides. Beginning in the 1950s the printer's initials, \\"F.N.M.T.\\", began to appear at the bottom of some stamps. Since 1977, the year of issue has appeared on Spanish stamps. Stamps in Spain are distributed and sold by the Spanish postal service known as the Correos y Tel√©grafos, and beginning in 2001 officially a governmental corporation, the Sociedad Estatal de Correos y Tel√©grafos, S.A. Since 2011 the corporation and its subsidiaries are known as the \\"Grupo Correos\\". Geographical and historical context Spain is located in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north by France, Cantabric Sea, and to the northwest and west by the Atlantic Ocean and Portugal. Spain was a monarchy established by Queen Isabella and King Fernando in the union of the Kingdom of Castile with the Kingdom of Aragon. Their marriage was in 1469. Spanish forces completed the reconquest in 1492, and Jews were expelled by the Alhambra Decree that same year. In 1713, France won War of the Spanish Succession and the Bourbon monarchy was established in Spain. Napoleon occupied Spain from 1808 to 1814. The \\"war of independence\\" against France was followed by the Carlist Wars, during which the First Spanish Republic briefly held sway until the restoration of the Bourbons in 1874. Spain remained a monarchy until 1931, when the Second Spanish Republic was established. Communists, socialists, statists and royalists fought the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, after which the Spanish State of Generalisimo Francisco Franco was generally recognized. The monarchy was restored in 1975 with the ascension of Juan Carlos as king. Until 1866, the currency was the real which equaled 8 cuartos or 32 maravedis. That year the escudo was introduced, equalling 100 centimos or 1000 milesimas. Early postal history Both Castile and Aragon had royal posts during the middle ages, and various monasteries and guilds had posts for their members, but Spain's postal system really developed from the contract that Philip I of Castile let to Thurn und Taxis in 1500. That contract gave Thurn und Taxis a monopoly over postal services in the kingdom, thus incommoding the existing entrenched, albeit piecemeal, systems. New route were set up and both naval and merchants ships were required to carry the mail. The system became comprehensive. By 1849 there were about 450 post offices in Spain. In May 1514, Joanna of Castile appointed the first postmaster for the Indies (Spanish holdings in the New World). But it was not until 8 August 1764, when a royal decree established the \\"Correo Maritimo de Espana y sus Indias Occidentales\\" (Maritime Mail of Spain and the Spanish West Indies), with its headquarters in Madrid and offices in major Spanish cites as well as in Havana, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo, that the system spread throughout the Spanish Empire.  First stamps  1851 Dos reales stamp, printed in blue instead of red. One of only 3 examples known. (The Tapling Collection) In 1843, the Spanish provisional government under General Narv√°ez began to study the British experiment of prepaid postage labels. Finding the British printers Perkins, Bacon and Petch too pricey, they decided to establish their own printer, and on 24 October 1849 Queen Isabella II decreed that Spain would use postage stamps effective 1 January 1850. In December postage ratesRates were: 6 cuartos for single-weight internal letters; 12c for double-weight internal letters; 5 reales for single-weight registered letters; 6r for registered mail to France; and 10r for registered mail to Spain‚Äôs possessions abroad. and regulations were promulgated and the first stamps of Spain were issued on 1 January 1850. There were five stamps in the set with denominations from six cuartos to ten reales in different colors with all of them depicting Queen Isabella II.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 9 Portugal & Spain. 5th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2004, p.265. They were printed lithographically and issued imperforate. Both thin and thick papers were used, but neither had any watermark. The 1850 stamps were replaced on 1 January 1851 with a new set of six stamps which added the two reales denomination in red, and changed the five reales from red to rose in color. These 1851 stamps had a new portrait of Queen Isabella II, were typographed on thin paper, again without watermark, and issued imperforate. 1868 provisionals On 30 September 1868, following the Glorious Revolution which removed Queen Isabella II from the throne, a Provisional Government was formed in Spain pending the election and inauguration of a new king. Isabella II stamps were separately overprinted for use in Madrid, Andalusia, Valladolid, Asturias, Salamanca, and Teruel. These were followed by stamps marking the regency of Marshal Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre. They depicted a stylized ‚ÄúEspa√±a‚Äù, known as La Matrona, where a woman's head represented the motherland. In 1872 royal heads briefly reappeared on Spanish stamps with King Amadeo, but were followed by the issues of the First Republic with a seated La Matrona. Regional costumes issues From 1967 through 1971, Spain issued a series of stamps that portrayed regional costumes from throughout Spain. Altogether, fifty-three such stamps were issued, at the rate of twelve per year, until the last year, when in 1971 only five such stamps were issued. The first stamp in the seriesScott #1392 showed a traditional woman's costume of the Basque province of √Ålava.

This section of the river flows through impressive escarpments of over high and was first identified as \\"the nasty portage\\" by Jesuit Pierre-Michel Laure on his map of 1731. The following year, this missionary used the First Nations name Katchiskataouakigs, also used by Bellin on his map of 1744. A map of Jonathan Carver from 1776 indicated \\"Falls and Rift\\" to characterize the place. Not until the end of the 19th century did the current toponym begin to appear on survey maps. In 1941, Alcan built at the head of these rapids a dam called Chute-des-Passes, forming Lake Peribonka behind it. The dam's name also refers to the nearby hamlet that formed the east side of the river, and was the former name of Passes-Dangereuses Territory.

The film's story revolves around two sisters, one of whom is preparing to marry just before a rogue planet is about to collide with Earth. Von Trier's initial inspiration for the film came from a depressive episode he suffered. The film is a Danish production by Zentropa, with international co- producers in Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany and Italy. Filming took place in Sweden. Melancholia prominently features music from the prelude to Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde (1857‚Äì1859). It is the second entry in von Trier's unofficially titled \\"Depression Trilogy\\", preceded by Antichrist and followed by Nymphomaniac. Melancholia premiered 18 May 2011 at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically lauded. Dunst received the festival's Best Actress Award for her performance, which was a common area of praise among critics. Although it has detractors, many critics and film scholars have considered the film to be a personal masterpiece; it has since been featured in multiple listings of the best films of 2011, the best films of the 2010s, and the best films of the 21st century.  Plot  The film begins with an introductory sequence involving the main characters and images from space. These virtually still images reveal the key elements of the film: Justine the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Brueghel's The Hunters in the Snow burning; the black horse collapsing in slow motion; Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; her wedding dress tangled in plant matter; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before Melancholia crashes into Earth.  Part One: \\"Justine\\"  Delayed by their stretch limousine's difficulty traversing the narrow winding rural road, newlyweds Justine and Michael arrive two hours late for their own wedding reception at the estate of Justine's sister, Claire, and her husband, John. Justine has a dysfunctional family: brother-in-law John constantly complains about having to pay for the wedding despite being very well-off; father Dexter is hedonistic and selfish to the point of narcissism, while mother Gaby is brutally jaded, openly declaring her hatred of marriages during her wedding speech. No one ever asks what Justine wants, or why she is unhappy, but throughout the dinner she is praised for being beautiful. Claire urges Justine to hide her debilitating melancholy from her new husband Michael. Justine finds several excuses to flee the wedding reception and wander the estate by herself. At one point, while the guests stand around waiting for the cutting of the cake, Justine and Gaby independently escape to take baths. Michael is pressured to give a speech at one point, but it is very dispassionate and vapid. He attempts to consummate his marriage with Justine, despite her being clearly non-receptive, even ignoring her at one point when she asks if they can simply sit together for a while, causing her to flee in frustration. Claire tells Justine she is \\"lying to everyone\\", while John aggressively reminds Justine how much the wedding cost and tells her she \\"better be fucking happy\\". Justine's boss, Jack, is ruthless, greedy, and gluttonous. During his wedding speech, he's hustling Justine to meet a work deadline. He pushes her throughout the evening to create a tagline to promote a new campaign. Her boss's nephew, Tim, is given the chance to exploit the opportunity to get the tagline at all costs in order to promote his career: a task similar to what Justine was previously so successful at. He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception, pressuring her for the tagline. Eventually, Justine goes out onto a sand trap and has sex with Tim. Unable to get the tagline from Justine, Tim is later fired for his \\"professional\\" failure. Finally reaching a breaking point, Justine resigns by telling Jack that he is a \\"despicable, power-hungry little man\\", and storming off. After several hours of being alienated from each other, Justine and Michael quietly agree to call off the marriage. Michael departs, leaving a severely depressed Justine isolated at the estate, with Claire and John furious at her. While storming back into the estate, a wedding planner tells Claire the total number of beans in a jar for a lottery that was held during the event. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices Antares is no longer visible in the sky.  Part Two: \\"Claire\\"  Later, the reason for Antares's disappearance has become public knowledge: a newly discovered rogue planet called Melancholia, which entered the Solar System from behind the Sun, was blocking the star from view. The planet has now become visible in the sky as it approaches ever closer to Earth. John is excited about the \\"fly- by\\" predicted by scientists, while Claire is frightened by alternate predictions of Earth being hit and destroyed. Melancholia's first approach and final collision with Earth, as described (and shown briefly in a similar diagram) in the film In the meantime, Justine's depression has grown worse. She can barely muster the mental strength to get inside a cab to arrive to Claire and John's estate, and is essentially catatonic upon arrival. Claire takes her sister under her care. One day, while horseback riding, Justine finally notices Melancholia in the sky, visible to the naked eye. Upon seeing Melancholia in person, Claire becomes withdrawn and fearful, afraid that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assurances. She searches the Internet and finds an article predicting that Earth's gravitational pull will draw Melancholia back towards it after its \\"fly-by\\", ultimately leading to the Earth's obliteration. Her husband assures her that these anecdotes are written by \\"prophets of doom\\". Claire tries to relax, to little effect; meanwhile, Justine unexpectedly shows signs of improvement. She begins to bathe and eat meals on a regular schedule again. The day of the predicted \\"fly-by\\", Justine tells Claire that the Earth is evil, and that they don't need to grieve for it. Claire dismisses her sister's claims, but is unsettled when Justine unexpectedly tells her the correct number of the bean lottery from the wedding, as proof of her clairvoyance. Justine then tells Claire \\"Life is only on Earth. And not for long.\\" That night, Melancholia passes very close to Earth, but ultimately begins to recede in the night sky, to Claire's great relief. The next morning, John has become visibly nervous, not breaking away from his telescope. When John vanishes after Claire naps, Claire observes Melancholia through the astronomical equipment and realizes it is actually getting bigger and circling back‚Äîas predicted by the Internet article. Horrified, she looks for John, only to find him dead in the stables (he purposefully overdosed on pills Claire was saving). Claire releases Abraham, and when Justine asks where John is, Claire says that he has ridden into the village. Claire calls the rest of her family together for a completely typical breakfast, but shortly into it, Claire's attempt at calm breaks and she once again checks Melancholia's closeness. Seeing that it has nearly doubled in size, Claire realizes the Earth is doomed and descends into a panic. In a moment of desperation, she attempts to flee the estate with her son, but the cars will not start, and the golf cart shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge that Justine had attempted earlier. Returning to the mansion, Claire tries to accept the inevitable. In a private conversation with Justine, Claire suggests that their last act be coming together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine crassly dismisses her idea. Having noticed that Abraham is wandering around the estate without any sign of his father, Claire's son, Leo, is frightened. \\"Dad said there's nothing to do, nowhere to hide,\\" Leo says, aware of Melancholia's closeness. He is reassured by Justine, who uses his innocence in order to soothe him, saying that they can be safe in a \\"magic cave\\". Justine cries to herself as Leo embraces her. They gather tree sticks to build the cave in the form of a teepee without canvas. The \\"magic cave\\" stands in the middle of a field on the golf course. Leo, Justine, and Claire sit in the teepee, holding hands as atmospheres from both planets begin to violently merge. Leo believes in the magic cave and closes his eyes. Claire is terrified and cries profusely. Justine watches them both, and accepts her fate calmly and stoically. In the last shot, Leo and Justine sit in meditative posture as Melancholia fills the sky behind the teepee, while Claire breaks away from their handhold and panics alone. Melancholia hits, sending a wall of fire passing through the field as the planets collide, vaporizing the trio and cutting the screen to black. The sounds of the destruction of both planets slowly echo and rumble into total silence.  Cast  Production = Development  The idea for the film originated during a therapy session Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray astrophysics realistically, but as a way to examine the human psyche during a disaster. The idea of a planetary collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset that it would be clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Pen√©lope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by the Marquis de Sade. Melancholia was produced by Denmark's Zentropa, with co-production support from its subsidiary in Germany, Sweden's Memfis Film, France's Slot Machine and Liberator Productions. The production received 7.9 million Danish kroner from the Danish Film Institute, 600,000 euro from Eurimages and 3 million Swedish kronor from the Swedish Film Institute. Additional funding was provided by Film i V√§st, DR, Arte France, CNC, Canal+, BIM Italy, Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Sveriges Television and Nordisk Film & TV-Fond. The total budget was 52.5 million Danish kroner. Cruz was initially expected to play the lead role, but dropped out when the filming schedule of another project was changed. Von Trier then offered the role to Kirsten Dunst, who accepted it. Dunst had been suggested for the role by the American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson in a discussion about the film between him and von Trier.  Filming  Tjol√∂holm Castle in Halland, Sweden, where exterior scenes were filmed, viewed from above. Principal photography began 22 July and ended 8 September 2010. Interior scenes were shot at Film i V√§st's studios in Trollh√§ttan, Sweden. It was the fourth time Trier made a film in Trollh√§ttan. Exteriors included the area surrounding the Tjol√∂holm Castle. The film was recorded digitally with Arri Alexa and Phantom cameras. Trier employed his usual directing style with no rehearsals; instead the actors improvised and received instructions between the takes. The camera was initially operated by Trier, and then left to cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro who repeated Trier's movements. Claro said about the method: \\"[von Trier] wants to experience the situations the first time. He finds an energy in the scenes, presence, and makes up with the photographic aesthetics.\\" Trier explained that the visual style he aimed at in Melancholia was \\"a clash between what is romantic and grand and stylized and then some form of reality\\", which he hoped to achieve through the hand-held camerawork. He feared however that it would tilt too much toward the romantic, because of the setting at the upscale wedding, and the castle, which he called \\"super kitschy\\".  Post-production  The prelude to Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde supplies the main musical theme of the film, and Trier's use of an overture-like opening sequence before the first act is a technique closely associated with Wagner. This choice was inspired by a 30-page section of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, where Proust concludes that Wagner's prelude is the greatest work of art of all time. Melancholia uses music more than any film by Trier since The Element of Crime from 1984. In some scenes, the film was edited in the same pace as the music. Trier said: \\"It's kind of like a music video that way. It's supposed to be vulgar.\\" Trier also pointed out parallels between both the film's usage of Wagner and the film's editing to the music and the aesthetics of Nazi Germany. Visual effects were provided by companies in Poland, Germany and Sweden under visual effects supervisor Peter Hjorth. Poland's Platige Image, which previously had worked with Trier on Antichrist, created most of the effects seen in the film's opening sequence; the earliest instructions were provided by Trier in the summer 2010, after which a team of 19 visual effects artists worked on the project for three months.  Release  In his director's statement, Trier wrote that he had started to regret having made such a polished film, but that he hoped it would contain some flaws which would make it interesting. The director wrote: \\"I desired to dive headlong into the abyss of German romanticism ... But is that not just another way of expressing defeat? Defeat to the lowest of cinematic common denominators? Romance is abused in all sorts of endlessly dull ways in mainstream products.\\" The premiere took place at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where Melancholia was screened in competition on 18 May. The press conference after the screening gained considerable publicity. The Hollywood Reporter's Scott Roxborough wrote that \\"Von Trier has never been very P.C. and his Cannes press conferences always play like a dark stand-up routine, but at the Melancholia press conference he took it to another level, tossing a grenade into any sense of public decorum.\\" Trier first joked about working on a hardcore pornographic film that would star Dunst and Gainsbourg.Trier subsequently announced production of the film Nymphomaniac, which would contain hardcore sequences and would, indeed, co-star Gainsbourg. When asked about the relation between the influences of German Romanticism in Melancholia and Trier's own German heritage, the director brought up that he had been raised believing his biological father was a Jew, only to learn as an adult that his actual father was a German. He then made jokes about Jews and Nazis, said he understood Adolf Hitler and admired the work of architect Albert Speer, and jokingly announced that he was a Nazi. The Cannes Film Festival issued an official apology for the remarks the same day and clarified that Trier is not a Nazi or an anti-Semite, then declared the director \\"persona non grata\\" the following day. This meant he was not allowed to go within 100 meters of the Festival Palace, but he did remain in Cannes and continued to give promotional interviews. The film was released in Denmark on 26 May 2011 through Nordisk Film. Launched on 57 screens, the film entered the box-office chart as number three. A total of 50,000 tickets were eventually sold in Denmark. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 30 September, in Germany on 6 October and in Italy on 21 October. Magnolia Pictures acquired the distribution rights for North America and it was released on 11 November, with a pre-theatrical release on 13 October as a rental through such Direct TV vendors as Vudu and Amazon.com. Madman Entertainment bought the rights for Australia and New Zealand.  Reception = Critical response  Melancholia received positive reviews from critics. The film holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 7.39/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Melancholias dramatic tricks are more obvious than they should be, but this is otherwise a showcase for Kirsten Dunst's acting and for Lars von Trier's profound, visceral vision of depression and destruction.\\" The film also holds a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" A 2017 data analysis of Metacritic reviews by Gizmodo UK found the film to be the most critically divisive film of recent years. Kim Skotte of Politiken wrote that \\"there are images‚Äîmany images‚Äîin Melancholia which underline that Lars von Trier is a unique film storyteller\\", and \\"the choice of material and treatment of it underlines Lars von Trier's originality.\\" Skotte also compared it to the director's previous film: \\"Through its material and look, Melancholia creates rifts, but unlike Antichrist I don't feel that there is a fence pole in the rift which is smashed directly down into the meat. You sit on your seat in the cinema and mildly marveled go along in the end of the world.\\" Berlingske's Ebbe Iversen wrote about the film: \\"It is big, it is enigmatic, and now and then rather irritating. But it is also a visionary work, which makes a gigantic impression.\\" The critic continued: \\"From time to time the film moves on the edge of kitsch, but with Justine played by Kirsten Dunst and Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the leading characters, Melancholia is a bold, uneven, unruly and completely unforgettable film.\\" Steven Loeb of Southampton Patch wrote, \\"This film has brought the best out of von Trier, as well as his star. Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted, that she won the award for Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival this past May. Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is, Dunst's performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it.\\" Sukhdev Sandhu wrote from Cannes in The Daily Telegraph that the film \\"at times comes close to being a tragi-comic opera about the end of the world,\\" and that, \\"the apocalypse, when it comes, is so beautifully rendered that the film cements the quality of fairy tale that its palatial setting suggests.\\" About the actors' performances, Sandhu wrote: \\"all of them are excellent here, but Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role‚Äîtroubled, serene, a fierce savant‚Äîthat it feels like a career breakthrough. Meanwhile, Gainsbourg, for whom the end of the world must seem positively pastoral after the horrors she went through in Antichrist, locates in Claire a fragility that ensures she's more than a whipping girl for social satire.\\" Sandhu brought up one reservation in the review, in which he gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars: \\"there is, as always with Von Trier's work, a degree of intellectual determinism that can be off-putting; he illustrates rather than truly explore ideas.\\" Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, called the film \\"clunky\\" and \\"tiresome\\", judging it to be \\"conceived with[out] real passion or imagination\\", and not \\"well written or convincingly acted in any way at all\\", and gave it two stars out of a possible five.  Accolades  Dunst received the Best Actress Award at the closing ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival. The film won three awards at the European Film Awards for Best Film, Best Cinematographer (Manuel Alberto Claro), and Best Designer (Jette Lehmann). The US National Society of Film Critics selected Melancholia as the best picture of 2011 and named Kirsten Dunst best actress. The film was also nominated for four Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards: Best Film ‚Äì International; Best Direction ‚Äì International for von Trier, Best Screenplay ‚Äì International also for von Trier, and Best Actress ‚Äì International for Dunst. Film Comment magazine listed Melancholia third on its Best Films of 2011 list. The film also received 12 votes‚Äîseven from critics and five from directors‚Äîin the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll of the greatest movies ever made, making it one of the few films of the 21st century to appear within the top 250. In 2016, the film was named as the 43rd best film of the 21st century, from a poll of 177 film critics from around the world. In 2019, Time listed it as one of the best films of the 2010s decade, while Cahiers du cin√©ma named it the eighth best film of the 2010s. That same year, Vulture named Melancholia the best film of the 2010s. Adaptations In 2018, playwright Declan Greene adapted the film into a stage play for Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. The cast featured Eryn Jean Norvill as Justine, Leeanna Walsman as Claire, Gareth Yuen as Michael, Steve Mouzakis as John, and Maude Davey as Gaby, while child actors Liam Smith and Alexander Artemov shared the role of Leo. In the adaptation, the character of Dexter, Justine's father is omitted, while Justine's boss, Jack, is combined with John.

Career Jordu Schell began his career as a sculptor and Halloween mask maker. He primarily sculpts in clay and other physical materials, rather than in CGI or in 2-D drawings, although he works in those forms as well. Schell first started designing FX for Hollywood on Bride of Re-Animator, and went on from there to work with Stan Winston on such movies as Predator 2, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns. In television, he designed aliens for the opening season of Babylon 5. From 2005 to 2007, Schell was instrumental in the design of the Na'vi and other creatures in James Cameron's movie Avatar, shaping the designs of the characters with physical sculptures when Cameron felt that the CGI designs were not capturing his vision. Schell sculpted numerous maquettes to help solidify the look of the Na'vi race, often working in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home. Films for which Schell has designed creatures and characters subsequent to his work on Avatar include The Mist, AVPR, Prince Caspian, Spike, Creature of Darkness, and Dragonball Evolution, as well as working in various FX capacities on several others. Schell also teaches classes in sculpting and design at his studio and, in addition, sometimes works in the video game industry.

Joosten admitted to offences dating from 2014 to May 2020 after being exposed by Strasbourg LION (laboratoire d‚Äôinvestigation op√©rationnelle du num√©rique) as part of a lengthy investigation.https://www.dna.fr/faits- divers-justice/2020/06/19/un-professeur-d-universite-juge-pour-detention-d- images-pedopornographiques Joosten downloaded the images over a six year period. He was 'relieved to be arrested'. He described his addiction to pornographic images and videos of children as a \\"secret garden\\" that contradicted who he is as a person. On his conviction, he was not immediately incarcerated. His sentence would be supervised, and he would have to complete a three-year programme of treatment. He was prohibited from any activity bringing him into contact with minors. Joosten has four children. R√©mi Gounelle, the Dean of the Facult√© de th√©ologie protestante de Strasbourg, released this statement following Joosten's arrest: ‚ÄúNous sommes tous tomb√©s de haut. Il n‚Äôy avait aucune suspicion de ce genre, aucun probl√®me avec les √©tudiants. C‚Äôest une affaire moralement tr√®s choquante mais qui ne remet pas en cause les grandes comp√©tences p√©dagogiques et scientifiques de Jan Joosten. C‚Äôest surtout profond√©ment triste. Jan est tomb√© dans une forme d‚Äôaddiction dont il n‚Äôa pas r√©ussi √† sortir. Il luttait contre ses pulsions n√©gatives sans parvenir √† y √©chapper. Cela nous montre la complexit√© de l‚Äô√™tre humain. Jan est un coll√®gue tr√®s appr√©ci√© et il vivait avec √ßa. Cela rend humble de d√©couvrir cette addiction, cette fragilit√©.‚Äù Gounelle argued that, whilst the unmasking of Joosten as a paedophile was deeply shocking, it does not call into question his pedagogical and scientific skills. Joosten still holds a role at the University of Strasbourg. In a public statement that noted his \\"shocking crimes and... the suffering endured by those in the images he accessed,\\" Oxford University announced Joosten's removal from employment.

Since it was broadcast by Channel 7 at 8 p.m., the name was shortened to \\"6, 7, 8\\". In late 2009, the program was moved to 9 p.m., a new segment was added to be aired on Sundays at night, and new guest panelists were invited, making it more than six members.Asteriscos.tv Seis, siete, ocho ¬øy ahora a las nueve? Nevertheless, the show's name remained unchanged. It was first hosted by Mar√≠a Julia Oliv√°n and a panel which included Orlando Barone, Carla Czudnowsky, Eduardo Cabito Massa Alc√°ntara, Luciano Galende and Sandra Russo, along with a guest analyst who would give their opinions throughout the program. Mar√≠a Julia Oliv√°n announced in an interview for web site Television.com.ar that, on January 28, 2010, should make her last appearance on the program. Her place was occupied by Luciano Galende, and from 2013 onward the host has been Carlos Barrag√°n. The program was nominated to the 2010 Mart√≠n Fierro Awards in the category Best Journalistic Program. The program's panel discussed national and world events and analyzed their social and political repercussions on Argentina. The program has come under criticism due to its perceived advocacy of Kirchnerism, which is controversial since it is aired by a state-owned TV channel during the time when Cristina Kirchner was president. The program ceased to be aired shortly after the end of the presidency of Cristina Kirchner.  Airing history  6, 7, 8 was first aired on march 9, 2009. The initial name was \\"6 in the 7 at 8\\", making reference to the 6 people in the program, the channel Televisi√≥n P√∫blica Argentina that airs in channel 7, and that the program was broadcast at 8:00 pm. Although the number of people and the timeslot changed over time, the name \\"678\\" was kept. It is an Archive television program focused on politics and journalism. It was created during the campaign for the 2009 midterm elections, in order to broadcast the Kirchnerite propaganda known as Relato K, and to attack the opposing candidates. It received a privileged timeslot on Sundays, right after the broadcasting of the F√∫tbol para todos weekly matches. Once the elections were over, it continued to voice the Kirchnerite view in the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media.Oliv√°n, pp. 9-12 Mauricio Macri, president of Argentina since December 10, 2015, appointed Hern√°n Lombardi as the new manager for Channel 7.

According to an article in La Naci√≥n that was published the next day about the segment, \\"the presentation of the hidden camera, and the images of the hidden camera (cut, but carefully and professionally edited) do not, at any moment, show the columnist in situations that could corroborate the serious and injurious charges about corruption that are made in the video through printed boards and a voice-over\\".La Naci√≥n.com, ¬´Agravia Canal 7 a un columnista con un video an√≥nimo¬ª In the video, there are appearances by other people who may represent Pagni, receiving money in return for newspaper articles.

MWUC was able to mobilize a large majority of local miners, preparing for a strike. The mine owners rejected negotiations, and the mayor of Estevan prohibited manifestations by MWUC. When the MWUC took to the streets to protest, they were met with police fire. Three people were killed on September 29, 1931. Twelve miners were arrested in the aftermath.

Peck says he based some characters and plot in the book on his own experiences growing up on Long Island, in New York, and in Kansas.Morago, Greg. \\"Touching Story Grows From Sprout.\\" Houston Chronicle. June 28, 2009. Plot synopsis The novel is written in the first person singular. At times, it appears to be in the form of an essay or letter to the reader, but at other times it seems to be simply the protagonist telling his story. Portions of the novel are told in flashback, depicting Sprout's first few months in school. Much of the book is written in the stream of consciousness narrative style. Significant portions of the book focus on peer pressure, the role social stratification and social cohesion play in rural life, and norms of social conservatism. The novel opens with Sprout making claims about whether people know about his homosexuality, his short height, his poverty, or his dead mother (among other things). But Sprout claims to have a secret, but it is a secret which everyone knows about. The nature of Sprout's open secret is a narrative framing device which opens and closes the novel. Sixteen-year-old Daniel Bradford is nicknamed Sprout. In a flashback, the reader learns that his mother dies of cancer when he is 12 years old. His father has trouble dealing with her death and becomes an alcoholic. Early one morning, Sprout's father announces they are leaving New York and heading for Kansas. Sprout's father buys a plot of tree-covered land near Hutchinson, Kansas. The family takes up residence in a very small vacation trailer. Sprout's father begins covering the trailer in vines, and plants upside-down tree roots all over the property. Sprout's father has no job; the family lives off the proceeds from the sale of their former home. In another flashback, Sprout reveals that he has trouble fitting in at his new school due to his New York accent, odd way of dressing, poverty, and lack of a mother. He is harassed by the school bully, Ian Abernathy, but is befriended by an eccentric tomboy named Ruthie Wilcox. One day, after he and Ian both receive detention, the two boys wrestle. This leads to Ian initiating a sexual relationship with Sprout.Although the nature of the sexual conduct is not described in the novel, Sprout tells his father and teacher that he is having sex with Ian. Thus, the nature of the relationship appears to be more than mere nudity or fondling, but it is later stated that they never kissed. Sprout reveals that he and Ian continue to engage in sexual conduct on-and-off for the next four years, but that he desires an actual relationship. He distracts his peers from these facets of his life by dying his hair green (see the cover illustration). At the end of Sprout's sophomore year, he meets Mrs. Miller, who teaches English grammar and literature at the high school. Mrs. Miller has discovered that Sprout is an excellent writer. The state of Kansas sponsors a (fictional) statewide essay contest. Over the past several years, Mrs. Miller has coached many students who have entered this contest, and her students have won the event more times than any other teacher in the state. During the summer, Mrs. Miller has Sprout come to her home each day to be coached by her. Sprout learns that Mrs. Miller, too, has a drinking problem. Mrs. Miller meets Sprout's father, and the two begin a relationship. Both adults also learn that Sprout is gay and has been having sex with Ian Abernathy. Mrs. Miller counsels Sprout to not mention his homosexuality in his essay, for fear it would alienate the politically conservative judges. That same summer, Sprout's relationship with Ruthie grows cold for several reasons. Shortly after the start of his junior year, Sprout meets Ty Petit, a local Kansas boy whose father is a violent man who appears to believe in the Christian Patriot movement. (Ty's father idolizes Timothy McVeigh.) The Petit children were abandoned by their mother, which has left Ty with severe emotional issues‚Äîmade worse by his father's constant child abuse. Ty and Sprout become close friends, and have several emotionally intense experiences together. Sprout also learns about deep secrets in Ty's past, such as the suicide of his twin brother who had suffered from severe depression. After being chased by a homicidal Saint Bernard, Ty kisses Sprout (Sprout's first kiss), and they begin a secret relationship. Ty continues to assert that he is not gay (even though he and Sprout have sex with one another). The climax of the novel centers around Sprout's betrayal of Ty at a critical moment. When Ty runs away from home after this incident, Sprout believes he is the reason behind it. Several other major issues are addressed (including Sprout's open secret) in the novel's few remaining pages. Critical reception Critic Greg Morago of the Houston Chronicle called the book \\"a poignant novel about coming out and coming of age.\\" It \\"has a lot to teach all ages about the oft encouraged but never easy process of being yourself and accepting yourself.\\" A review in The Horn Book Magazine was equally positive: \\"Structurally effective, caustically entertaining, unpreachy, and thought-provoking, Sprout is a satisfying look at the truths one young man unearths about himself.\\"Gershowitz, Elissa. \\"Young Adult Review: Dale Peck, Sprout.\\" The Horn Book Magazine. July 1, 2009. Daniel Kraus, writing in Booklist, lauded the way that the author handles the movement of characters like Ruthie, Ian, Mrs. Miller, and Ty in and out of the story, calling this \\"both absorbing and jarring.\\"Kraus, Daniel. \\"Young Adult Review: Sprout.\\" Booklist. May 15, 2009. He gave the novel a glowing review: \\"But the prose is as intelligent and playful as Sprout himself... The lengthy, leisurely chapters allow readers to live through the characters rather than view them as mere plot pushers, and the result is a story rarely content to move in conventional directions.\\" A reviewer for School Library Journal enjoyed Peck's use of vocabulary and cultural references (such as to Guns & Ammo magazine and the Borg cube), noting this \\"will intrigue readers who enjoyed Lemony Snicket's built-in definitions in their younger years.\\"Knapp, Maggie. \\"Sprout.\\" School Library Journal. June 1, 2009. Critic and author Richard Labonte described the book as \\"More an 'out, so what' than a classic coming out story,\\" and called it \\"charming yet sharp-edged\\".Labonte, Richard. \\"Book Marks.\\" Between the Lines. August 13, 2009. Kirkus Reviews gave the book a mixed but overall very positive review. \\"Peck's first aimed squarely at the YA audience is, at times, charming. Sprout's narrative voice is strong and realistic, and his observations are entertaining. As a whole, though, there're just too many issues. Add to the above: dating parent, teen pregnancy, betrayals of and by friends. Dedicated readers, especially young gays in the square states, will identify‚Äîand it's important enough for that reason.\\"\\"Sprout.\\" Kirkus Reviews. May 2009. School Library Journal also found flaws in the novel, concluding that the adult characters were not realistic and that some passages in the novel bordered on the sexually crude. Overseas reviews were mixed. A review in Melbourne, Australia's The Age newspaper concluded: \\"Queer teen fiction is flourishing, and the strength of Dale Peck's protagonist‚Äîsardonic, intellectually curious and impossibly sure of his identity‚Äîmakes Sprout one of the more winning examples of it.\\"Woodhead, Cameron. \\"Sprout.\\" The Age.

This species is from the genus Dolomedes, the fishing spiders. This species of fishing spider is named after the mythological Greek god Triton who is the messenger of the big sea and the son of Poseidon.Species Dolomedes triton ‚Äì Sixspotted Fishing Spider, BugGuide These spiders can be seen scampering along the water‚Äôs surface when a person walks by in which they are often referred to as dock spiders because they are often witnessed as they quickly vanish through the cracks of a boat dock.  Description  This spider can be identified by its large size and distinctive markings. They have eight eyes with good vision and the body is grey to brown. They have a white to a pale cream colored stripe running down each side of the cephalothorax. The abdomen has many light colored spots and also has light colored lines running down the sides of the abdomen. When this species is seen from below, there are six dark spots present on the bottom of the cephalothorax in which the common name is derived. Like many spiders, this species shows sexual dimorphism.Sixspotted Fishing Spider The female is larger than the male. The female is about long including the legs; her body length is and the male's body is long.Sixspotted Fishing Spider The juvenile spiders look similar to adults but are smaller and they go through a series of molts within their lifetime to grow and reach adult size. While somewhat visually similar to D. striatus, this species is distinguished by its unique pattern of three pairs of dark sternal spots and several light spots on the abdominal dorsum. Males have a more apically rounded tibial apophysis that extends past the tibia apex. In females, the seminal valve of the copulatory apparatus can be found in the anterior half of the dorsal epigynous area with loose fertilization tubes. This species is known to be remarkably variable over their geographic range, both in terms of appearance and behavior. Dorsal aspect showing the markings on the body  Distribution and habitat = Geographic distribution  These spiders are native to the Western Hemisphere and can be found throughout the contiguous United States and southern Canada, more common east of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. They can also range into Mexico.Dolomedes triton, Animal Diversity Web They have been reported in areas ranging from Ontario to Maine to southern Florida and Texas, west to the southern panhandle of Alaska and south to the Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas, Mexico. However, they are not commonly collected from southwestern states.  Habitat  They are semi-aquatic and live in wetland habitats such as ponds, lake shores, and they can also inhabit slow-moving streams. This can include the littoral zones of lakes and ponds as well as the more slow moving pools and edge zones of streams. They can be found among emergent vegetation, rocks and other structures near the water such as boat docks. They often dive underwater and grab onto a plant when frightened.  Diet = Predatory feeding  D. triton are capable of capturing fish up to five times their body size, and venom is used to immobilize and kill prey. Potential prey include both aquatic and terrestrial insects that have fallen into the water, tadpoles, frogs, and small fish. As such, they are one of the few spider species known to feed on vertebrate species. One study conducted in central Alberta, Canada found that both juveniles and adults feed primarily on arthropods residing on fresh water surfaces and that diet can vary considerably based on size, geographic distribution, and seasonal changes. Prey were mainly living, and D. triton spiders are not repelled by sclerotization and metasternal secretions of potential prey. Juveniles tend to consume smaller prey than mature spiders, especially females, who demonstrated a considerable lack of small prey capture, a trend that researchers connect to the intense energy needs of yolk production. Prey detection is thought to arise through two different strategies-- the use of tactile stimuli on the water surface and via eyesight. For the former strategy, the anterior two pairs of legs rest on the water surface and respond to the stimuli of ripples along the water surface. Visual stimuli, while used, are less important. This species is diurnal, which means that it hunts during the day as it waits patiently for hours until stimulated by prey. They are often seen with their legs sprawled out by the water while they are waiting for prey. These spiders eat insects, vertebrates, tadpoles and occasionally small fish. They hunt by the water‚Äôs surface in which they can walk on water and dive under up to to capture prey. Their good vision contributes to their success when diving to capture prey. They capture underwater prey as well as prey that fall on the water's surface or travels on water, such as water striders.  Webs = Web type  As active hunters that stalk or ambush aquatic prey, D. triton spiders do not use their webs for prey capture. Nevertheless, silk plays an important role in adaptation to aquatic environments. Silk is used to construct trailing safety lines (known as draglines) used in movement across bodies of water, for example. As spiders reach sexual maturity, males and females use web construction in different ways. Females use their draglines to transport pheromones to attract potential mates while males use silk to build sperm webs and nuptial gifts. Females also use silk to envelop eggs in spherical egg sacs and create nursery webs to house newly hatched spiderlings.  Construction  Researchers identified four categories of silk protein types in the silk of D. triton-- aciniform, ampullate, pyriform, and tubuliform. Egg sacs contain two distinct layers, with the outer layer thought to protect eggs from water due to its unique elemental composition and hydrophobic characteristics.  Mating = Female/male interactions  Pheromones = In this species, courtship is initiated via silk-based pheromones that come from females. Research reveals that these female dragline hormones, which allow for long distance chemical signaling, persist on wet surfaces and water. Males follow female draglines in a lycosid-like manner on land and with an alternating form for rowing and pulling when the dragline extends over water. Due to the ability of the signal to persist in aquatic settings, pheromones are thought to be non- or mildly polar compounds, perhaps a lipid or steroid. = Mate choice = Since males are generally able to escape female attacks after copulation, they are able to mate again. Furthermore, while males do not seem to discriminate between virgin and non- virgin females in courting, females are unlikely to mate a second time and exhibit aggressive behavior towards males after their first copulation. Evidence from field observations in Alberta, Canada (mating behaviors may vary based on location) suggests that D. triton is protandrous, meaning that males that emerge earlier have greater access to the limited resource of virgin females, a mating system that resembles ‚Äòscramble competition polygyny,‚Äô where competition for mates takes the form of a race between competitors. Furthermore, males gain an advantage if they are able to copulate more quickly, allowing them to move on to another female. Females also gain an advantage from quick copulation as they are able to subsequently divert resources and energy to egg production over mating activities. As males can likely not discriminate between mated and non-mated females, males may stay with penultimate stage females until molting to the adult stage, a phenomena that closely resembles cohabitation. = Courting = Pre-copulatory behavior after pheromone signaling starts with an announcement display where males signal with ‚Äúleg-waving‚Äù (lifting and waving of legs in an alternating or synchronous pattern, likely a visual signal) and ‚Äújerks.‚Äù This preliminary period is known as ‚Äúpalpation.\\" The male approaches using his own dragline and initiates rapid tapping motions with the previously raised legs. ‚ÄúJerks‚Äù involve irregular leg extensions that generate a double burst of concentric surface waves that emanate from his location (likely a vibratory signal). The female responds to the approaching male by ‚Äúdrumming‚Äù on a substrate, such as the water surface, and initiating her own slower form of leg waving. Afterwards, a prolonged period of mutual leg waving begins before copulation. For virgin females, male vibratory signals lead to females running towards the potential mate. However, mated females often ‚Äúfeign coyness‚Äù by waiting for males to approach before attacking them. = Copulation = Copulation occurs when males of the species insert one palp into the female. This is done only once during copulation and is accomplished by prying open the epigynum using the tibial apophysis as a lever. = Sexual cannibalism = D. triton exhibit pre-copulatory cannibalism in which predation of males by females occurs prior to copulation, an extreme form of intersexual conflict in which there are no benefits to males of the species. Mating trials indicate that virgin females attack in 20-30% of pairings and that success occurs up to 40% of the time. Not only do males constitute a regular part of the female diet, but male population density also tends to decrease after the emergence of females. The findings of one study demonstrate how pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism of D. triton supports the idea of the ‚Äúaggressive-spillover‚Äù hypothesis in which pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism acts as a non-adaptive by product of voracity (aggression towards prey). Consistent with this hypothesis, females with the highest juvenile feeding rate were the most likely to exhibit pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism. While pre-copulatory cannibalism has been extensively studied for this species, females commonly attack males during and after copulation as well.  Reproduction and parental care  Around 10-14 days after mating occurs, female spiders produce egg sacs which are then transported in the female‚Äôs mouth. Egg production can happen anytime between June to September and sometimes in April but this is not often. Before hatching, the female builds a \\"nursery web\\" over vegetation and guards it.Six-spotted Fishing Spider ‚Äì Dolomedes triton The egg sac is placed among the leaves to help keep it concealed. After the offspring have hatched, they sit under her protection in the web until they are ready to disperse into the outside world. The offspring leave the web about a week after they hatch. Females exhibit intense defense of egg sacs, which are so strongly attached to the mouthparts that removing the egg sac from the mouthparts results in egg sac rupture. When boldness was measured as the time spent on water versus submerged (with more time on water seen as more bold), females were more bold during parental care. This trend, while initially surprising, may reflect the energetic costs of staying underwater with an egg sac or developmental impediments when eggs stay underwater for extended periods of time. Both food availability and female size have significant effects on reproductive output. Field observations demonstrate a decrease in clutch size, egg sac weight, and body size as food availability is limited. This was particularly true of larger females, which indicates that, in less resource rich ponds, smaller females may have a selective advantage whereas large females perform better in areas with high food availability. As cannibalism had no effect on fecundity and egg sac weight, researchers assume that cannibalism has no significant nutritional benefit for females.  Enemies  While it remains unclear what preys most on the species, birds, bats, and fish are all thought to prey on D. triton. The distinct camouflage coloration suggests that these spiders are preyed on by visual predators. Furthermore, pompilid and sphenoid wasps, which use sight when hunting, are thought to parasitize Dolomedes species. In a study focusing on the anti- predator behavior of females of the species, it was found that female boldness is positively correlated with female aggression for certain behaviors, principally aggression towards prey (crickets were used for the study) and pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism of courting males.  Physiology = Locomotion  The ventral surface of the body of D. triton is coated with a hydrophobic substance that allows them to stay afloat and run across water, an ability they use in both prey capture and predation escape. CC BY 2.0 license In order to both evade predation and capture prey, these spiders are also able to dive into the water. As an anti-predator response, air and water borne vibrations act as stimuli leading spiders to dive underwater and grab hold of a submerged substrate, such as aquatic vegetation or submerged rocks. A sort of air capsule covers the spider, allowing the spider, if healthy, to re-emerge from the water completely dry. Submergence durations of up to 90 minutes have been observed. Submergence is accomplished by launching off a stationary object or jumping from an object above surface level. Spraying the spiders with alcohol also reduces their submergence capacity as they are unable to produce the required air envelope. Despite the benefits of submergence, it is thought to incur some behavioral-ecological costs including lost foraging opportunities as water surface vibrations are needed to detect prey, reduced mating and parental care capabilities, and potential vulnerability to predation from aquatic predators.  Vibratory signal perception  D. triton species are able to determine the source of vibrations from up to at least 20-25cm. The curvature of the wave and the amplitude gradient as the wave passes the spider are thought to be the primary means of determining prey/predator distance on water. amphipod, showing chelicerae and pedipalp movement  References  Category:Dolomedes Category:Spiders of North America Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Six-spotted fishing spider"},{"id":"26971762","text":"Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson (February 18, 1940 ‚Äì May 22, 2015) was an American artist.

The value (in $'000s) of monthly approvals for educational buildings in Australia since July 2000. The spike leading up to 2010 corresponds to the BER program. Building the Education Revolution (BER) is an Australian government program administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) designed to provide new and refurbished infrastructure to all eligible Australian schools. The program was part of the Rudd government's economic stimulus package designed as a response to the 2007‚Äì2010 global financial crisis. The program, totalling A$16.2 billion has three elements: *Primary Schools for the 21st Century ($14.2b): providing new and refurbished halls, libraries and classrooms *Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools ($821.8m): providing new and refurbished science laboratories and language learning centres *National School Pride program ($1.28b): providing new and refurbished covered outdoor learning areas, shade structures, sporting facilities and other environmental programs. The program has attracted attention from critics of the government for alleged \\"rorting\\" (misappropriation of public funds) and for not delivering value-for-money outcomes. Instances of inflated quotes or new buildings that were not particularly useful to the school were reported. The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott called for a judicial inquiry into the BER and the Home Insulation Program, described by the opposition Liberal Party as \\"failed programs\\" and a \\"waste of public money\\". In April 2010, the government announced the formation of the BER Implementation Taskforce \\"to ensure projects are providing value for money\\". Gillard defended the BER saying that it was \\"already one of the most heavily scrutinised programs in the nation's history\\" and that the program was the \\"centerpiece\\" of an economic stimulus package that helped to \\"ensure that a generation of Australians weren't consigned to months or years of joblessness\\". After the 2010 election BER moved under the portfolio of Senator Chris Evans. The Taskforce, headed by Brad Orgill, former chairman and chief executive of UBS Australasia, delivered its report to Senator Evans on 15 December 2010. The report found that most of BER projects had been successfully delivered, with only 3% of the schools involved in the program making complaints. Projects in NSW received the most complaints. The third and final report by Brad Orgill found that BER projects in NSW, QLD and VIC overpaid for buildings by more than 25% on average compared to Catholic schools and more than 55% compared to Independent schools. The ANAO investigation into the project ruled that comparison with those projects were not valid as the standards applied to government school facilities were higher. Economist Joseph Stiglitz commented in August 2010 that the government's stimulus package, including the BER, was well-designed by world standards and that some waste was inevitable. On 25 March 2014 three Australian academics published a paper in the International Journal of Public Administration that argued that the BER program represents a \\"'case study' of how governments should not pursue large-scale public expenditure programs\\". The paper says that the BER illustrates the pitfalls of large-scale public expenditure programs, and that it did not provide value for money.

Fawcett and Ashworth's French Renaissance style design, entitled \\"the Green Light\\", was one of seventeen entries, with a winning prize of ¬£500 (which at the time was equivalent to a well-paid, two years' wages). Fawcett and Ashworth were both employed by Victorian Railways, and much controversy arose ‚Äì particularly initiated by the architect of the runner-up entry, Charles D‚ÄôEbro ‚Äì as to having an unfair advantage due to this. The designers were constrained by the narrow land for the project, and therefore were required to come up with a solution for the design of the fa√ßade that broke away from the usual practice of layering it, \\"bringing forward the more important aspects. The designers claimed they 'broke the building design upwards' instead and attributed more architectural significance to the entrances\\".Davies, Jenny (2008), Beyond the Fa√ßade: Flinders Street, more than just a railway station, Endless Possibilities, p. 24) The announcement of the winning entries was made on 22 May 1900, and widely publicised. The judges felt their design adequately addressed all the requirement, and had a more satisfying grandeur than other entries. The French Renaissance style of domes, arches and towers provided a suitable grandeur, which combined with Edwardian and Art Nouveau features made it ultimately unusual in Melbourne (leading to the urban legend that design was intended for Bombay and got mixed up in the post, and comparisons to the Taj Mahal). Much of Fawcett and Ashworth's design is still prevalent today despite the many modifications made after the plans had been selected.

It is found in southern Canada (Alberta to Quebec) and nearly all of the lower 48 states except peninsular Florida. It grows in upland open woods, fields, barrens, and rocky cliffs. Fragrant sumac is a woody plant that can grow to around tall with a rounded form. It produces yellow flowers in clusters in March or April before the leaves emerge, before anthesis.(1.) Pistillate (female) plants bear hairy red drupes in July or August that can last until the next March if not eaten by birds or small mammals. The leaves and stems of fragrant sumac have a citrus fragrance when crushed, hence the species name. Leaves resemble those of its relative poison ivy, but fragrant sumac is not poisonous. It inhabits mostly uplands areas, while poison ivy has no odor and can inhabit various habitats. The leaves are alternate and trifoliate with the middle leaflet being the largest of the three. It develops a good autumn color like other sumacs of bright yellow to red to red-purple. Some are grown by large, diverse nurseries or by native- plant nurseries and are infrequently planted in landscapes in the Midwest and East. It grows in full deep shade to full sun and well-drained soils slightly acid to well alkaline with a pH range of about 6.0 to 8.5. It has a shallow, fibrous root system and is easily transplanted. Some of its branches can trail upon the ground and root and it can ground sucker to form a colony, depending on the site. While this species is not really well-known and used often by landscapers and homeowners, the cultivar 'Gro-low' is commonly planted as a high groundcover, and some are sold at most any nursery or garden center. However, buying this plant is done mostly by landscape architects and designers, (or by customers influenced by nursery personnel recommending it), who know the plant, while most homeowners do not know it and look instead for bushes or groundcovers with pretty flowers or evergreen foliage. 'Low-Gro' sumac grows about 2 ft high and easily spreads 6 to 8 ft around, developing good autumn color. Conservation status in the United States It is listed as of special concern and believed extirpated in Connecticut. However, this status applies only to native populations.\\"Connecticut's Endangered, Threatened and Special Concern Species 2015\\". State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Bureau of Natural Resources. Retrieved 28 January 2018.

He served as the chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors from 1976 to his defeat for reelection by Democrat Audrey Moore. He has previously served as a member of the board, representing the Springfield district, from 1971 to his being elected chairman in 1975. He was the father of current member of the Board of Supervisors and Congressional candidate, Pat Herrity. Herrity served as chairman during Fairfax County's period of growth in the last few decades of the 20th century, when the County, previously known as a quiet suburb of Washington, D.C.; became the high population center of the Dulles Technology Corridor that it is known as presently. During that period of growth, the Board advocated for the construction of Interstate 66 inside the Capital Beltway and for the Dulles Toll Road, as well as for a major expansion of Tysons Corner, Virginia, which now is home to many employers in the information technology industry. In May 1994, the 62-year-old Herrity received a heart transplant from a 55-year-old woman. He died of an aortic aneurysm at Inova Fairfax Hospital on February 1, 2006.
