The growth type of the Dehn function is a quasi-isometry invariant of a finitely presented group. The Dehn function of a finitely presented group is also closely connected with non-deterministic algorithmic complexity of the word problem in groups. In particular, a finitely presented group has solvable word problem if and only if the Dehn function for a finite presentation of this group is recursive (see Theorem 2.1 in ). The notion of a Dehn function is motivated by isoperimetric problems in geometry, such as the classic isoperimetric inequality for the Euclidean plane and, more generally, the notion of a filling area function that estimates the area of a minimal surface in a Riemannian manifold in terms of the length of the boundary curve of that surface. History The idea of an isoperimetric function for a finitely presented group goes back to the work of Max Dehn in 1910s. Dehn proved that the word problem for the standard presentation of the fundamental group of a closed oriented surface of genus at least two is solvable by what is now called Dehn's algorithm. A direct consequence of this fact is that for this presentation the Dehn function satisfies Dehn(n) ≤ n. This result was extended in 1960s by Martin Greendlinger to finitely presented groups satisfying the C'(1/6) small cancellation condition.Martin Greendlinger, Dehn's algorithm for the word problem. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, vol. 13 (1960), pp. 67-83. The formal notion of an isoperimetric function and a Dehn function as it is used today appeared in late 1980s - early 1990s together with the introduction and development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups. In his 1987 monograph \\"Hyperbolic groups\\"M. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups in: \\"Essays in Group Theory\\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75-263\\\\. . Gromov proved that a finitely presented group is word-hyperbolic if and only if it satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality, that is, if and only if the Dehn function of this group is equivalent to the function f(n) = n. Gromov's proof was in large part informed by analogy with filling area functions for compact Riemannian manifolds where the area of a minimal surface bounding a null-homotopic closed curve is bounded in terms of the length of that curve. The study of isoperimetric and Dehn functions quickly developed into a separate major theme in geometric group theory, especially since the growth types of these functions are natural quasi-isometry invariants of finitely presented groups. One of the major results in the subject was obtained by Sapir, Birget and Rips who showedM. Sapir, J.-C. Birget, E. Rips. Isoperimetric and isodiametric functions of groups. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol 156 (2002), no. 2, pp. 345-466. that most \\"reasonable\\" time complexity functions of Turing machines can be realized, up to natural equivalence, as Dehn functions of finitely presented groups. Formal definition Let : G=\\\\langle XR\\\\rangle\\\\qquad (*) be a finite group presentation where the X is a finite alphabet and where R ⊆ F(X) is a finite set of cyclically reduced words. =Area of a relation= Let w ∈ F(X) be a relation in G, that is, a freely reduced word such that w = 1 in G. Note that this is equivalent to saying that w belongs to the normal closure of R in F(X), that is, there exists a representation of w as :w=u_1r_1u_1^{-1}\\\\cdots u_m r_mu_{m}^{-1} \\\\text{ in } F(X), (♠) where m ≥ 0 and where ri ∈ R± 1 for i = 1, ..., m. For w ∈ F(X) satisfying w = 1 in G, the area of w with respect to (∗), denoted Area(w), is the smallest m ≥ 0 such that there exists a representation (♠) for w as the product in F(X) of m conjugates of elements of R± 1. A freely reduced word w ∈ F(X) satisfies w = 1 in G if and only if the loop labeled by w in the presentation complex for G corresponding to (∗) is null-homotopic. This fact can be used to show that Area(w) is the smallest number of 2-cells in a van Kampen diagram over (∗) with boundary cycle labelled by w. =Isoperimetric function= An isoperimetric function for a finite presentation (∗) is a monotone non-decreasing function :f: \\\\mathbb N\\\\to [0,\\\\infty) such that whenever w ∈ F(X) is a freely reduced word satisfying w = 1 in G, then :Area(w) ≤ f(w), where w is the length of the word w. =Dehn function= Then the Dehn function of a finite presentation (∗) is defined as :{\\\\rm Dehn}(n)=\\\\max{{\\\\rm Area}(w): w=1 \\\\text{ in } G, w\\\\le n, w \\\\text{ freely reduced}.} Equivalently, Dehn(n) is the smallest isoperimetric function for (∗), that is, Dehn(n) is an isoperimetric function for (∗) and for any other isoperimetric function f(n) we have :Dehn(n) ≤ f(n) for every n ≥ 0\\\\. =Growth types of functions= Because Dehn functions are usually difficult to compute precisely, one usually studies their asymptotic growth types as n tends to infinity. For two monotone-nondecreasing functions :f,g: \\\\mathbb N\\\\to [0,\\\\infty) one says that f is dominated by g if there exists C ≥1 such that : f(n)\\\\le Cg(Cn+C)+Cn+C for every integer n ≥ 0\\\\. Say that f ≈ g if f is dominated by g and g is dominated by f. Then ≈ is an equivalence relation and Dehn functions and isoperimetric functions are usually studied up to this equivalence relation. Thus for any a,b > 1 we have an ≈ bn. Similarly, if f(n) is a polynomial of degree d (where d ≥ 1 is a real number) with non-negative coefficients, then f(n) ≈ nd. Also, 1 ≈ n. If a finite group presentation admits an isoperimetric function f(n) that is equivalent to a linear (respectively, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, exponential, etc.) function in n, the presentation is said to satisfy a linear (respectively, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, exponential, etc.) isoperimetric inequality. Basic properties *If G and H are quasi-isometric finitely presented groups and some finite presentation of G has an isoperimetric function f(n) then for any finite presentation of H there is an isoperimetric function equivalent to f(n). In particular, this fact holds for G = H, where the same group is given by two different finite presentations. *Consequently, for a finitely presented group the growth type of its Dehn function, in the sense of the above definition, does not depend on the choice of a finite presentation for that group. More generally, if two finitely presented groups are quasi-isometric then their Dehn functions are equivalent. *For a finitely presented group G given by a finite presentation (∗) the following conditions are equivalent: **G has a recursive Dehn function with respect to (∗). **There exists a recursive isoperimetric function f(n) for (∗). **The group G has solvable word problem. ::In particular, this implies that solvability of the word problem is a quasi- isometry invariant for finitely presented groups. *Knowing the area Area(w) of a relation w allows to bound, in terms of w, not only the number of conjugates of the defining relations in (♠) but the lengths of the conjugating elements ui as well.

However, in general there is no reasonable bound on the Dehn function of a finitely presented group in terms of the deterministic time complexity of the word problem and the gap between the two functions can be quite large.

Moreover, every group with the word problem solvable in time T(n) can be embedded into a group with isoperimetric function equivalent to n2T(n2)4. Generalizations *There are several companion notions closely related to the notion of an isoperimetric function. Thus an isodiametric functionS. M. Gersten, The double exponential theorem for isodiametric and isoperimetric functions. International Journal of Algebra and Computation, vol. 1 (1991), no. 3, pp. 321-327. bounds the smallest diameter (with respect to the simplicial metric where every edge has length one) of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. A filling length function the smallest filling length of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. Here the filling length of a diagram is the minimum, over all combinatorial null-homotopies of the diagram, of the maximal length of intermediate loops bounding intermediate diagrams along such null- homotopies.S. M. Gersten and T. Riley, Filling length in finitely presentable groups. Dedicated to John Stallings on the occasion of his 65th birthday. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 92 (2002), pp. 41-58. The filling length function is closely related to the non-deterministic space complexity of the word problem for finitely presented groups. There are several general inequalities connecting the Dehn function, the optimal isodiametric function and the optimal filling length function, but the precise relationship between them is not yet understood. *There are also higher-dimensional generalizations of isoperimetric and Dehn functions.J.

For k ≥ 1 the k-dimensional isoperimetric function of a group bounds the minimal combinatorial volume of (k + 1)-dimensional ball-fillings of k-spheres mapped into a k-connected space on which the group acts properly and cocompactly; the bound is given as a function of the combinatorial volume of the k-sphere. The standard notion of an isoperimetric function corresponds to the case k = 1\\\\.

Gromov proposed a probabilistic or averaged version of Dehn function and suggested that for many groups averaged Dehn functions should have strictly slower asymptotics than the standard Dehn functions. More precise treatments of the notion of an averaged Dehn function or mean Dehn function were given later by other researchers who also proved that indeed averaged Dehn functions are subasymptotic to standard Dehn functions in a number of cases (such as nilpotent and abelian groups).O.

History Baljci was founded at the end of the 15th century by vlachs coming from Eastern Herzegovina, who essentially belonged to the Mirilovići clan. These people, most of whom where of Serbian Orthodox faith, were settled there by the Turks after the previous population had almost entirely fled to the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Hungary. The name of the village itself was probably chosen in reference to Baljci in Herzegovina, from where some of the new settlers came from, as for the neighboring settlement of Mirilović, today known as Mirlović Polje. Over a few decades, Baljci was definitely established on the territory of a former medieval village known in historical sources as Suhovare. Under this former settlement name, Baljci was included in the Ottoman nahiye of Petrovo Polje, itself part of the Sanjak of Klis. At the end of the 17h century, after the War of Candia, Baljci and the neighboring villages were annexed by the Republic of Venice. New settlers came to the village in the 18th century, which also saw the building of an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist in 1730.

Furze left school to become a plumber, a trade which he pursued until joining the Sky1 programme Gadget Geeks. Furze has used his plumbing and engineering experience to build many unconventional contraptions, including a hoverbike, a wall of death, a jet-powered motorcycle made with pulsejet engines, and the world's fastest mobility scooter, pram, and dodgem. Certain projects he has undertaken have been funded by television and video game franchises for promotion, including a spring-loaded hidden blade and grappling hook from the Assassin's Creed franchise, an artificial-turf-covered BMW E30 containing a hot tub and barbecue grill, and a bunker underneath his back garden to promote Sky1's television series You, Me and the Apocalypse. He celebrates reaching YouTube subscriber milestones by staging ever-more-extravagant firework stunts. Biography Colin has said that he attended Malcolm Sargent Primary School as a child until he transitioned into secondary school. By then he had already begun making underground dens and a few tree houses. He became a plumber after leaving school at 16, which allowed him to focus working on tools, gadgets and engineering. Shortly after the death of his father, he discovered the video- sharing website YouTube on which he shared his inventions beginning with his wall of death ramp in 2007. He and his wife have daughter named Erin and a son (born in 2012) named Jake who is often featured in Colin's videos. Inventions Furze's many contraptions are publicised on his YouTube channel. On 13 March 2010, he uploaded a video of his converted scooter, incorporating a flame thrower that could shoot flames up to in the air. On 25 March 2010, Furze was arrested by Lincolnshire Police, for possessing an object converted into a firearm. He was released on bail without charge the next day. This was Furze's third attempt at artificing such a device, as the first did not ignite and the second burst into flames.The Daily Telegraph (27 March 2010). \\"Flame-thrower scooter owner arrested.\\" The Daily Telegraph.

In November 2015, Furze constructed an underground bomb shelter beneath his garden, as part of a request by Sky1 to promote the series You, Me and the Apocalypse. The bunker contains a corridor and a large main room, as well as a fully functional air filtration system, and has an entrance shaft concealed by a garden shed.

It was then operated as a summer hotel by his widow and daughters until World War II. The log structure is built of timber cut, sawn and hauled by Ezra Kauffman. The logs were sawn on three sides and left rounded on the outside. Inside walls were lined with metal and a muslin facing, with wallpaper pasted to the fabric in most rooms, with colored fabric left exposed in some rooms. Oilcloth was used on the kitchen walls and ceiling. The logs were laid on a stone foundation. Gables are finished in fish-scale shingles. The house featured an indoor water supply fed from a galvanized tank in the attic, which was filled from a hand pump at the lakeshore. Water was hauled by hand in the winter. In 1946 the Kauffmans sold the house to Henry Rhone who operated it until 1973, when the Grand Lake Historical Society purchased the house for use as a museum. It is the only pre-20th century log hotel remaining in Grand Lake. The Kauffman House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1974.

These are divided into two groups; :A) “Orders” – that is a signal for an action :B) “Unit” – which identifies a unit (usually battalion, regiment, brigade, division)  History of the bugle calls  Bugle calls have in history been used to relay orders over distances or to large formation of troops. Some of the traditions of the Norwegian Armed Forces have their roots from either the personal union with Denmark or Sweden. This is also true when it comes to bugle calls, E.g. the bugle call for \\"Troop\\" is in Norway and Sweden identical. But due to Norwegian history and historical trade routes with the United Kingdom and The Netherlands some bugle calls have been borrowed and incorporated into the Norwegian Armed Forces, e.g. the bugle call \\"Parade\\" is identical to the same bugle call in Sweden, and identical \\"to the colours\\" in the United States. With the rise of Norwegian nationalism from 1814 to 1905 composers like Johannes Hanssen wrote new bugle calls based on old Norwegian folk tunes. One such example is the Unit call for the Valdres Battalion, which is also the baseline tune for the more known Valdres March. Today, the bugle calls are primarily used for ceremonial functions such as flag hoist/lowering, change of commands, military burials, religious service, etc.  Bugle calls  The Norwegian Army maintains these bugle calls as represented below with their respective meanings, i.e., “orders”: Revelje - Revellie This bugle call is used to awaken the troops and prepare for morning inspection or roll call. Spisesignal - Mess call This bugle call gives notice that a meal is ready to be served. Oppstilling - Formation – First call This bugle call orders the troops to assemble in formations. Flaggappell – To the colors This bugle call gives notice to all personnel that the national flag (Flag of Norway) is being hoisted/lowered, and that they are therefore to stand at attention and render honours. Tropp – Company This bugle call orders troop formations to take up positions, or that the battalion/regimental colours / Flag of Norway is to be brought to the fore of the troop formation for parade. Vaktombytte – Changing of the guard This bugle call is sounded during a changing-of-the-guard ceremony to signal that the new guard has taken up its post and the old guard has been dismissed. Tappenstrek – Taps This bugle call orders all activity to cease for the night. Historically it is linked to the Dutch words tap den doe that is translated as “plug the keg”; meaning that the soldiers were to be served no further alcohol, and were to return to base. Rosignal – Tattoo Literally \\"call for quiet\\", this bugle call orders all non-essential lights out. Appell – Flourishes This bugle call is to announce the entrance of high-ranking officers from the rank of brigadier up to full general. A flourish is repeated according to the rank number of stars: (1- Brigadier, 2 - Major General, 3 -Lieutenant General, 4 – General). Parademarsj – Parade march This bugle call gives notice either to the entrance/attendance of His Majesty the King or to alert soldiers to give their attention and honour the colours as they are presented formally in slow march at the head of a formation. Bønn – Church call – Remembrance This bugle call orders the stay of all services for prayer or religious services, or is used to mark an act of remembrance in the same way as “taps” in the USA or “Last post” in the UK and Commonwealth. It can be played bugle(s)-only or in combination with drum(s). Fremad Marsj – Forward March This bugle call orders the unit to advance at normal pace. Holdt – Halt This bugle call orders the unit to halt. Innrykkning – Charge This bugle call orders the unit to charge a position and take it. Alarm – This bugle call indicates that the unit is to stand-to. Flyalarm – Air-raid alarm This bugle call signals that an air raid is imminent. Panseralarm – Tank/panzer alarm This bugle call alerts an attack by armored units. Ild – Commence firing This bugle call orders units to open fire.

It was challenged in court up to the US Supreme Court, which upheld the top-two primary in Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party. Background The blanket primary in Washington State was started by an Initiative to the Legislature filed in 1934 and passed in 1935. The political parties in Washington tried numerous times to have an open or closed primary system implemented, and it even filed a lawsuit that was decided by the Washington State Supreme Court in 1936. The state was represented in that lawsuit by Warren Magnuson. The political parties in Washington State filed another lawsuit against it in 2000 when the blanket primary in California was overturned by California Democratic Party v. Jones and won the case. The Washington State Legislature passed a new primary system in 2004, which would have created a new top-two primary system, with an open primary as a backup, giving the Governor the option to choose. Secretary of State Sam Reed advocated for the top-two, but on April 1, 2004, the Governor used the line- item veto to activate the open primary instead.Washington State Governor Archives 2004 campaign Initiative 872 was filed on January 8, 2004 by Terry Hunt from the Washington Grange. The language of the ballot measure summary was as follows: > This measure proposes a new system for conducting primaries for partisan > offices. This proposal continues current practice of permitting voters to > vote for any candidate for any office in primary and general elections, > without limitation based on party. The two \\"top\\" candidates with the most > votes in the primary advance to the general election. Candidates continue to > designate their party. It becomes effective only if the court decision > invalidating the traditional blanket primary becomes final. The political parties in Washington opposed I-872 because they felt it would create an opportunity for someone not directly associated with the party to claim the party name on the ballot. The measure passed with 1,632,225 yes votes and 1,095,190 no votes in 2004.Ballotpedia More lawsuits On July 15, 2005, the initiative 872 was declared unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 18, 2008, the US Supreme Court reversed the decision and upheld 872.[ Supreme Court Decision] (PDF) Top two primary implementation The decision to uphold 872 changed the implementation of the 2008 primary election, which was held on August 19. =2008 election= In 2008, two State Senate races and five House of Representatives elections had either two Democrats or two Republicans get through the primary election, appearing together on the general election ballot. The results of a study from Gonzaga University comparing the results in Washington state between the 2004 (closed) and 2008 (top two) primaries, indicate that the top two primary overall reduced the likelihood of running against a same party candidate and it reduced the likelihood that a strong incumbent would face a challenger from his or her own party.

From 1997 to 2003, he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Just uses film technology and installation strategies as vehicles to create work that addresses complex contemporary issues through open-ended visual narratives rich in detail and metaphorical import, using a mixture of multiple video channels, sound installations, live performance and sculptural and architectural interventions. Just has works in over twenty-five museum collections, such as Guggenheim Museum in New York, Tate Modern in London and Museum of Modern Art in New York. Just works exclusively in film, shooting on a variety of film stock, including 8 mm, 16 mm and 35 mm. His works which date from 2003 and before were recorded in digital video. All of his later works were shot on film and then transferred to high-definition video. The resulting images are dense and atmospheric. Their prominent soundtracks are conceived specifically for each film in co-operation with different musicians. His works have been shown throughout Europe and the United States, including at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles (2005), the Miami Art Museum (2007) and the Witte de With in Rotterdam (2007). His exhibitions include Romantic Delusions at the Brooklyn Museum, U-Turn at the Copenhagen Quadrennial in Denmark and the Liverpool Biennial in the UK. Servitudes was on show at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris from June 24 to September 13, 2015.  Artistic practice  Just's films are moody, atmospheric narratives often with ambiguous and unresolved storylines. Thematically, his film works revolve around \\"the complex inter-relations between sexuality, love and cinema\\".Jacob Lillemose. \\"Waltz of the Middle-Aged Woman\\" in Von Olfers, Sophie, ed. Jesper Just Film Works, 2001-2007, exhibition catalogue. Rotterdam: Witte de With, 2007, page 135. Many of his older films specifically question conventional notions of masculinity. Nina Folkersma wrote, \\"A real man is supposed to contain his emotions, to be inviolable, intellectual, pragmatic, virile, and dominant. That, at least, is the image of man portrayed in most Hollywood films. Transgressing social and cinematographic conventional representations of masculinity is a crucial element of Just’s work.\\"Nina Folkersma. \\"An Introduction to Jesper Just\\" in Von Olfers, Sophie, ed. Jesper Just Film Works, 2001-2007, exhibition catalogue. Rotterdam: Witte de With, 2007, page 36. Just uses Hollywood conventions as a kind of backdrop for his narratives. His films surprise the viewer with unexpected plot twists and characters stepping out of their expected roles. In Invitation to Love (2003), for instance, a young man takes off his shoes and dances barefoot on a table for an older man. A press release that introduced his A Voyage in Dwelling exhibition, sats, \\"Just's videos attempt to dissect the nature of human interaction and the awkwardness of relationships. As in \\"A Vicious Undertow\\" (2007) - a seductive pas de trois between a middle-aged woman, and a younger woman and man – Just often seeks to emphasize the absurdity of gender roles and the way which cultures generate them. He presents charged relationships that could be perceived as perverse and endows them with beauty and dignity.\\" The film A Vicious Undertow (2006) marks a change in Just’s oeuvre. It is the first film that uses a female protagonist. This development can be followed throughout Just's newer films up to 2008. In an article in Frieze, Eliza Williams notes, \\"Far from naturalistic, his films contain a deliberate ambiguity, which, while at times unsettling, allows for an emotional resonance that speaks of a meaning above and beyond mere storytelling.\\" Influences of film noir aesthetics are present in his work and Just reveres the films of iconic directors such as Ingmar Bergman, Bob Fosse, Alain Resnais, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Michelangelo Antonioni. He employs a reappearing cast of professional actors, dancers and opera singers (the Danish actor Johannes Lilleøre, professional mathematician H.C., musician Dorit Chrysler and Mieskuoro Huutajat of The Finnish Screaming Men’s Choir).

He was appointed as reader in Aligarh Muslim University, later becoming professor of Urdu Language and then honorary consultant of the department. Khan journeyed to acquaint himself with the centres of Islamic importance in India, where he met Sheikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Zakariya al- Kandahlawi (1898–1982) and the reformer Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi, from whom he learned dawah and reformation. Soon after, he attended Lucknow University and earned a PhD.  Work  Khan is a prolific writer in Urdu. Perhaps his best-known work is A history in Urdu Journalism (1822–1857) (1991), which examines newspapers from nine different cities.Biswas, Subhas Chandra. Global trends in library and information science, p.119 (1995)() His works are part of the syllabi in various universities, and several have been translated into English. His wide-ranging study of Urdu journalistic literature is a contribution of abiding value to the appreciation of India ethos at a crucial moment in Indian history. His extensive study of contemporary Urdu literature, his rare insight into the process of social change and, above all, his unique faculty of analysis and interpretation are each reflected in his study which opens fresh vistas for the interpretation of socio-political history of modern India. Lately the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has studied the culture of the small French village Montaillou on the basis of Jacques Fouiern's Register's. His work is rightly claimed as constituting a landmark in modern historiography. No such work has so far been undertaken in India. The newspapers from Mirzapur, Benaras, Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur, etc., brought to light by Khan, will hopefully one day attract scholars to undertake similar studies of the intellectual and social milieu of the Indian towns. He prepared grounds for the utilization of journalistic literature for the reconstruction of the cultural history of India during the 19th century. Due to his sermons and simple and modest lifestyle, Dr Nadir Ali Khan commands respect from Muslims all over the world. He has a simple, eloquent and distinctive style of explaining the purpose of human life and its creation and often uses scientific examples to support his argument. He has delivered lectures to all types of communities in the society with the attendees being doctors, engineers, professors, businessmen, landlords, government officials, TV/film artists, ministers/politicians and sports celebrities. His untiring efforts brought real Islamic values in the lives of many Muslims.

The HBP is coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and is largely funded by the European Union. The project coordination office is in Geneva, Switzerland. Strategic goals and organisation The 2013 HBP Summit–the inauguration of the Project–took place in the EPFL Learning Centre in October 2013. It brought together scientists from over 100 Partner Institutions. Fundamental to the HBP approach is to investigate the brain on different spatial and temporal scales (i.e. from the molecular to the large networks underlying higher cognitive processes, and from milliseconds to years). To achieve this goal, the HBP relies on the collaboration of scientists from diverse disciplines, including neuroscience, philosophy and computer science, to take advantage of the loop of experimental data, modelling theories and simulations. The idea is that empirical results are used to develop theories, which then foster modelling and simulations which result in predictions that are in turn verified by empirical results. The primary objective of the HBP is to create an ICT-based research infrastructure for brain research, cognitive neuroscience and brain- inspired computing, which can be used by researchers world-wide. The Project is divided into 12 Subprojects. Six of these develop ICT-based platforms (Subprojects 5-10), which consist of prototype hardware, software, databases, and programming interfaces. These tools are available to researchers worldwide via the HBP Collaboratory. Three Subprojects gather data on empirical neuroscience and establish theoretical foundations (Subprojects 1-4) and one is responsible for ethics and society (Subproject 12). Subproject 11 coordinates the project. * SP1 Mouse Brain Organisation: Understanding the structure of the mouse brain, and its electrical and chemical functions * SP2 Human Brain Organisation: Understanding the structure of the human brain, and its electrical and chemical functions * SP3 Systems and Cognitive Neuroscience: Understanding how the brain performs its systems-level and cognitive functional activities * SP4 Theoretical Neuroscience: Deriving high- level mathematical models to synthesize conclusions from research data * SP5 Neuroinformatics Platform: Gathering, organising and making available brain data * SP6 Brain Simulation Platform: Developing data-driven reconstructions of brain tissue and simulation capabilities to explore these reconstructions * SP7 High-performance Analytics and Computing Platform: Providing the ICT capability to map the brain in unprecedented detail, construct complex models, run large simulations, and analyse large volumes of data * SP8 Medical Informatics Platform: Developing the infrastructure to share hospital and medical research data for the purpose of understanding disease clusters and their respective disease signatures * SP9 Neuromorphic Computing Platform: Developing and applying brain-inspired computing technology * SP10 Neurorobotics Platform: Developing virtual and real robots and environments for testing brain simulations * SP11 Management and Coordination: General coordination of the project * SP12 Ethics and Society: Exploring the ethical and societal impact of HBP’s work The HBP is coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and involves researchers from over 117 partner institutions in 19 countries across Europe. Notable Partner Institutions include the University of Heidelberg, Forschungszentrum Jülich, and the University Hospital of Lausanne. The scientific direction is provided by representatives from each of the HBP's Subprojects, which form the Science and Infrastructure Board (SIB). Katrin Amunts from Forschungszentrum Jülich is the Chair of the SIB. Alois Knoll from TU Munich is Vice Chair of the SIB for software. The Directorate steers the daily work of the HBP – it is led by Andreas Mortensen from EPFL. Funding The HBP is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) under the Horizon 2020 framework, an EU Research and Innovation funding programme. It was one of the two initial Future Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagship projects. The project is split into five phases, each supplied with separate funding. The call for funding for the Project's initial two-and-a-half-year 'Ramp-Up Phase' of EUR 54 million closed in November 2013 and the results were announced in March 2014. Twenty-two projects from thirty-two organisations were selected for the initial funding of EUR 8.3 million. The Ramp-Up Phase ended on 31 March 2016. Funding is reassessed every two years using Specific Grant Agreements (SGA); the first of which began in April 2016 (ending in April 2018), and the second with a total EU funding of 88 Million Euro starting in April 2018 (ending in March 2020). The HBP's total costs are estimated at EUR 1.019 billion, of which EUR 500 million will be provided by the European Commission, EUR 500 million by national, public and private organisations, and EUR 19 million by the Core Project Ramp-Up Phase Partners. Obstacles One of the Project's primary hurdles is the unsystematic nature of the information collected from previous brain research. Neurological research data varies by biological organisation schemes, species studied, and by developmental stages, making it difficult to collectively use the data to replicate the brain in a model that acts as a single system.\\"A Report to the European Commission\\" The Human Brain Project. Other obstacles include engineering problems involving power consumption, memory, and storage.https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/discover/the- project/overview For example, detailed neuron representations are very computationally expensive, and whole brain simulation is at the leading edge of our computational capability. Implications The Human Brain Project moved to Campus Biotech in 2014. Technologies generated by the HBP and other similar projects offer several possibilities to other fields of research. For instance, a brain model can be used to investigate signatures of disease in the brain and the impact of certain drugs, enabling the development of better diagnosis and treatment methods. Ultimately, these technologies will likely lead to more advanced medical options available to patients at a lower cost. In addition, detailed brain simulation requires significant computing power, leading to developments in supercomputing and energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing techniques. Computational developments can be extended into areas such as data mining, telecommunications, appliances, and other industrial uses. The long-term ethical consequences of the Project are also considered. The Project follows a policy of Responsible Research and Innovation, and its Ethics Advisory Board is responsible for monitoring the use of human volunteers, animal subjects, and the data collected. Implications on European society, industry, and economy are investigated by the HBP Ethics and Society Programme's Foresight Lab. Criticism An open letter was sent on 7 July 2014 to the European Commission by 154 European researchers (750 signatures as of 3 September 2014) complaining of the HBP's overly narrow approach, and threatening to boycott the Project. Central to this controversy was an internal dispute about funding for cognitive scientists who study high level brain functions, such as thought and behaviour. However, the HBP stated that there is “no question that cognition and behaviour are vital to the HBP”, explaining that cognitive neuroscience research was repositioned in the Project to allow the Core Project to focus on building the Platforms. In addition, The Open Letter called on the EC to “reallocate the funding currently allocated to the HBP core and partnering projects to broad neuroscience-directed funding to meet the original goals of the HBP—understanding brain function and its effect on society”. In its response, the HBP said that “while neuroscience research generates a vast amount of valuable data, there is currently no technology for sharing, organising, analysing or integrating this information, beyond papers and even databases. The HBP will provide the critical missing layer to move towards a multi-level reconstruction and simulation of the brain”. It added that “cognitive and behavioural neuroscience will become the most significant component of neuroscience in HBP over the course of the Project. However, for this to happen the Platforms have to be in place first”. Peter Dayan, director of computational neuroscience at University College London, argued that the goal of a large-scale simulation of the brain is radically premature, and Geoffrey Hinton said that \\"the real problem with that project is they have no clue how to get a large system like that to learn\\". Similar concerns as to the project's methodology were raised by Robert Epstein. The HBP has said that its members share the uncertainty surrounding large-scale simulation, but that “reconstructing and simulating the human brain is a vision, a target; the benefits will come from the technology needed to get there. That technology, developed by the HBP, will benefit all of neuroscience as well as related fields”. In 2015 the project underwent a review process and the three-member executive committee, led by Markram, was dissolved and replaced by a 22-member governing board. According to a 2019 article, \\"In 2013, the European Commission awarded his initiative—the Human Brain Project (HBP)—a staggering 1 billion euro grant (worth about $1.42 billion at the time)...the people I contacted struggled to name a major contribution that the HBP has made in the past decade.\\" See also * Blue Brain Project * BRAIN Initiative, US initiative * Brain/MINDS * China Brain Project * Decade of the Brain * Decade of the Mind * Human Connectome Project * Noogenesis * SpiNNaker References External links * Category:Computational neuroscience Category:Scientific modeling Category:Cognitive modeling Category:École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Category:Information technology organizations based in Europe Category:Neuroscience projects Category:European Commission projects Category:Supercomputing in Europe ","title":"Human Brain Project"},{"id":"20017669","title":"Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 84"},{"id":"20017670","text":"Raydon Wood railway station was a station in Suffolk, on a short branch line from Bentley Junction to Hadleigh.

Gadagkar has published over 275 scientific papers and articles in various international journals as well as in Indian journals like Current Science magazine, and the Journal of Biosciences (India), both published from Bangalore. His most important contribution to the field of evolution of eusociality is the theory of \\"assured fitness returns\\" which has been verified from empirical data and can be considered as a significant landmark in this field since the seminal work done by W. D. Hamilton in 1964. Over the last three decades he has established an active research group that has contributed towards understanding the proximate and ultimate factors of social evolution in wasps. Some of his opinionated articles on science policy have been controversial, such as his exception to the pay to publish, free to read Open Access science publishing model. His first book, Survival Strategies, has been translated into Chinese and Korean. It uses simple language to explain recent advances in behavioural ecology and sociobiology to a general audience. He has also written a more technical book, The Social Biology of Ropalidia marginata: Towards understanding the evolution of eusociality, which puts together over twenty years of his research about the evolution of eusociality.

Each volume is a two-disc set, and covers a three-year interval, with the exception of Volume Eight, which is a three-disc set and covers the last five years at Columbia. The series was first made available by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on October 30, 2007 and released Volume One: 1934-1936 and marked the first time the comedy team's shorts were released on DVD in chronological order. In addition, every film was remastered in high definition, another first for the comedy team's body of celluloid works. The series proved to be a success and was very popular so Sony released, Volume Two: 1937-1939 on May 27, 2008. Three months later, Volume Three: 1940-1942 was released on August 26, 2008. Volume Four: 1943-1945 was released just two months later on October 7, 2008. After the release of the fourth volume, the global economic crisis slowed down the release schedule. Volume Five: 1946-1948 was belatedly released on March 17, 2009. Volume Six: 1949-1951 was released three months later on June 16, 2009. Volume Seven: 1952–1954 was released on November 10, 2009, and included a pair of 3-D glasses to view the two shorts, Spooks! and Pardon My Backfire. As of 2013, the 3-D versions of these shorts have been removed for the current versions of this volume. The final volume, Volume Eight: 1955-1959, was released on June 1, 2010, which is a three-disc set and covers the last five years with Columbia Pictures. On June 5, 2012, all eight volumes were reissued in a box set entitled The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection, with the addition of a ninth, 3-disc volume entitled Rare Treasures from the Columbia Picture Vault. The additional volume featuring the feature films Rockin' in the Rockies and Have Rocket, Will Travel, several cartoons featuring the Stooges from the 1930s and 1940s, and a number of Columbia shorts featuring Shemp Howard, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita as solo comedians prior to joining the Stooges; several of these solo films are remakes of Stooge films. On October 18, 2016, The Three Stooges Collection was released. It had all the DVDs from volumes 1 through 8 but it did not include the \\"Rare Treasures from the Columbia Picture Vault\\" discs. All eight volumes are also available on iTunes. On June 15, 2020, iTunes released The Three Stooges: The Complete Series, which features all 190 shorts in an entire collection.

Among Shearson's most notable incarnations were Shearson / American Express, Shearson Lehman / American Express, Shearson Lehman Brothers, Shearson Lehman Hutton and finally Smith Barney Shearson. For its first eight decades, the firm operated independently and merged with several Wall Street securities firms including Hayden Stone & Co. and Loeb Rhoades & Co.. In 1981, Shearson was acquired by American Express and operated as a subsidiary of the financial services company before being merged with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in 1984 and E.F. Hutton & Co. in 1988. In 1993, Shearson was sold to Primerica, a predecessor of Citigroup, and merged with its retail brokerage business, Smith Barney, to create Smith Barney Shearson. The Shearson name was discontinued in 1994. History Shearson Lehman Hutton was the result of the combination of several Wall Street firms over a 25-year period beginning in the early 1960s that included Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb, E.F. Hutton, Hayden Stone & Co., Shearson, Hammill & Co., Loeb, Rhoades & Co., Hornblower & Company and Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, which ultimately came together under the ownership of American Express. =Shearson Hammill & Co. (1902–1974)= Edward Shearson (c. 1904), founder of Shearson, Hammill & Co. The Shearson name traces its origins to the formation of Shearson, Hammill & Co., a Wall Street brokerage and investment banking firm founded in 1902 by Edward Shearson and Caleb Wild Hammill. The firm originally built its business as a stock broker as well as a broker of various commodities, particularly grain and cotton. The firm was a member of the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before forming the firm, Shearson had served as comptroller of U.S. Steel and of Federal Steel Company before that. Shearson, who was raised in Ontario, Canada began his career as an auditor for the Wisconsin Central Railroad before taking a position in the steel industry in 1898. Shearson was an active member of New York society. Hammill, who was raised in Albion, Michigan, moved first to Chicago and subsequently to New York in 1890. Shearson, Hammill logo ca. 1960 The firm was originally headquartered in the Empire Building at 71 Broadway in New York City and maintained another main office in Chicago.Investment bankers and brokers of America. 1922. p.247 By the end of World War I, Shearson Hammill had six branch offices and seven correspondents.Markham, Jerry W. A financial history of the United States, Volume 3. 2002, p. 86 In the 1960s Shearson, Hammill became well known for its commercials that suggested \\"If You Want To Know What’s Going On On Wall Street, Ask Shearson Hammill\\".Commercial Classics: Shearson Hammill Commercial The firm had 63 offices in the US and internationally supported by a well-regarded securities research department.Benn, Alec. The unseen Wall Street of 1969–1975: and its significance for today. 2000, p.48 =Shearson Hayden Stone (1974–1979)= Shearson logo from 1978 In the early 1970s Shearson faced financial difficulties as did many of the venerable Wall Street firms in the midst of the 1973–1974 stock market crash. In response to the crisis, Shearson laid off a large portion of its staff in 1973.WALL STREET: A Private Depression. TIME, Apr. 16, 1973 Meanwhile, through the 1960s and 1970s, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the up-and-coming Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, had been acquiring many of Wall Streets oldest and most venerable investment banking and brokerage firms. By 1973 Weill's firm was known as Hayden Stone, Inc. following CBWL's acquisition of Hayden, Stone & Co. Despite its strong retail brokerage business, Shearson's capital reserves were diminished and, by 1974, it was clear that Shearson did not have sufficient capital to survive as an independent firm, opting to merge with Weill's better capitalized Hayden Stone, Inc.. The combined firm was renamed Shearson Hayden Stone, as Weill retained the Shearson brand, which was widely recognized as a major underwriter and brokerage.Shearson Lehman Brothers Company History. Funding Universe =Shearson Loeb Rhoades (1979–1981)= Weill's next major target in 1979 was another prominent investment bank, Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co., which like Shearson had been suffering financial difficulties and was looking for a potential acquiror. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Shearson and Loeb agreed to an $83 million ($ million today) all-stock merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades, with Weill assuming the position of CEO of the combined firm. At the time of the merger, Shearson Loeb Rhoades, with $260 million of combined assets and approximately $550 million of revenue, was among the largest investment banking houses. By most measures, Shearson became the second largest brokerage firm in the U.S. trailing only Merrill Lynch. The merger with Loeb Rhoades was more notable for introducing a stronger investment banking business to Shearson.The Urge to Merge. New York Magazine, May 28, 1979, p. 13Loeb Capital Partners timeline =Shearson/American Express= right During the 1980s American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services supercompany. In mid-1981 it purchased Sanford I. Weill's Shearson Loeb Rhoades, the second largest securities firm in the United States to form Shearson/American Express. Shearson Loeb Rhoades, itself was the culmination of several mergers in the 1970s as Weill's Hayden Stone, Inc. merged with Shearson, Hammill & Co. in 1974 to form Shearson Hayden Stone. Shearson Hayden Stone then merged with Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. (formerly Loeb, Rhoades & Co. and Hornblower & Weeks) to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979. With capital totalling $250 million at the time of its acquisition, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only Merrill Lynch as the securities brokerage industry's largest firm. After its acquisition by American Express, the firm was renamed Shearson/American Express. After selling Shearson to American Express, Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983. The following year, Weill was named chairman and CEO of American Express's insurance subsidiary, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within American Express and his conflicts with American Express' CEO James D. Robinson III. Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and after the firm's merger with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, Weill chose to resign from American Express in August 1985. Weill would return to building a large financial services company of his own, which would become Citigroup and would go on to acquire the core Shearson brokerage business that he had built in the 1960s and 1970s. =Shearson Lehman Brothers= In 1984 American Express acquired the investment banking and trading firm, Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express. left Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, which itself was the merger of Lehman Brothers and Kuhn Loeb in 1977 was led by Pete Peterson, a former United States Secretary of Commerce and future founder of the Blackstone Group. However, by the early 1980s hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders, who were driving most of the firm's profits, prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions. Coupled with Glucksman’s management style and a downturn in the markets, these tensions resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.Geisst, Charles R. The Last Partnerships. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 78 Upset bankers who had soured over the power struggle left the company. The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm. After the merger, Peter A. Cohen was named Chairman and CEO of Shearson Lehman,Peter A. Cohen. Forbes During this period, Shearson Lehman was aggressive in building its leveraged finance business in the model of rival Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1989, Shearson backed F. Ross Johnson's management team in its attempted management buyout of RJR Nabisco but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who were backed by Drexel. In 1984 Shearson/American Express purchased the 90-year-old Investors Diversified Services, bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. =Shearson Lehman Hutton= In 1988 Shearson Lehman acquired E.F. Hutton & Co., a brokerage firm founded in 1904 by Edward Francis Hutton and his brother Franklyn Laws Hutton. Under the Hutton brothers and later Robert M. Fomon and the well-known Wall Street trader Gerald M. Loeb, E.F. Hutton became one of the largest brokerage firms in the U.S. Hutton was best known for its commercials in the 1970s and 1980s that used the phrase, \\"When E. F. Hutton talks, people listen\\". Shearson Lehman Hutton logo In the 1980s Hutton was caught up in a number of difficulties that ultimately led the firm to seek a buyer. Hutton's most serious trouble came from a check kiting scandal that was uncovered in 1985. Hutton branches were writing checks against accounts at various regional banks and then funding those accounts with checks from yet other banks. This strategy, known as \\"chaining,\\" gave Hutton the use of money in both accounts until the checks cleared. In effect, Hutton was giving itself a free loan that also did not carry any interest. In early 1987, an internal Hutton probe revealed that brokers at an office in Providence, Rhode Island, laundered money for the Patriarca crime family. Although Hutton reported the investigation to the SEC, it was not enough to stop prosecutors from all but announcing that Hutton would be indicted. This last scandal was uncovered only a week before the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of November 1987, Hutton had lost $76 million, largely due to massive trading losses and margin calls that its customers could not meet. On December 3, 1987, Hutton agreed to a merger with Shearson Lehman in a $1 billion ($ today) deal. The merger took effect in 1988, and the merged firm was named Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. Following the merger, dozens of Hutton brokers left the firm to join competitors. At the same time, the combined firm suffered dwindling business from individual investors as its focus was shifted to large corporate transactions.Vanities on The Bonfire: Peter Cohen. Time, February 12, 1990 The Hutton brand was used until 1990, when American Express abandoned the name and the business was renamed Shearson Lehman Brothers. Joe Plumeri became the President & Managing Partner of Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1990. In 1992 Shearson sold the Boston Company, an asset management group, to Mellon Financial. In December 1988, the Boston Company, had disclosed that it had overreported its earnings by $30 million. =Sale and spinoff= When Harvey Golub became CEO of American Express in 1993, he negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and asset management business to Primerica. Primerica's Sanford I. Weill had been the architect of what had become Shearson/American Express in the 1960s and 1970s building up his small firm Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt into one of the largest brokerage firms in the US. The Shearson business was merged with Primerica's Smith Barney to create Smith Barney Shearson. Ultimately, the Shearson name was dropped in 1994. In 1994, American Express spun off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as Lehman Brothers. In 2008, the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers ended that firm. =The Shearson name over time= *Shearson Hammill & Co., 1901–1974, an investment banking and brokerage firm founded by Edward Shearson *Shearson Hayden Stone, 1974–1979, formed through the merger of Shearson, Hamill and Hayden, Stone & Co. *Shearson Loeb Rhoades, 1979–1981, formed through the merger of Shearson Hayden Stone and Loeb Rhoades & Co. *Shearson/American Express, 1981–1984, formed through the acquisition of Shearson Loeb Rhoades by American Express *Shearson Lehman/American Express, 1984–1988, formed through the acquisition of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb *Shearson Lehman Hutton, 1988–1990, formed through the acquisition of E.F.

The episode was written by Peter Elkoff and directed by John Terlesky. Plot The day begins with Betty and Amanda walking to work when Betty gets a call from the printer, Phil, to let her know about the upcoming issue. Later at work she asks Daniel's help, but he's about to go to a Meade Publications retreat with the other execs and Betty convinces him to let her give final approval to the latest Mode issue, that's themed \\"Fashion in the Eye of the Storm\\" in his absence. At the printing press, Betty takes a look and gives her approval, and even takes a photo of her with the cover. But when she returns to Mode and hears about a devastating tornado in Kansas, she realizes that they can't go to print because the cover featuring a fashion tornado would trivialize the tragedy in the heartland. As Betty begs Phil to stop the issue, Phil says that he can't do it unless Daniel and Wilhelmina say so. Betty tries to get hold of Daniel or Wilhelmina, but Claire has requested they surrender all their electronic equipment, so they can focus on creative revenue-generating schemes in an effort to see if Connor can help save the company. While Wilhelmina, who was reluctant to go to the retreat, finds herself being more attracted to Connor, especially during a hunting gun shoot, Daniel befriends a woman named Molly, who sprained an ankle falling on top of him from a tree. As they reach the retreat, Connor arrives to carry Molly...who happens to be his fiancée. Marc is still thinking about his proposal to Cliff, and it affects Betty as she convinces him to drive her to the retreat to contact Daniel. Along the way, Betty and Amanda get caught up in Marc's fretting over his proposal and whether he should go through with it, until Amanda accidentally causes the vehicle to veer off the road. Betty walks off and wanders into a store while Marc and Amanda tend to Cliff's station wagon, and after being hit by a boy's toy plane, she gets the idea to hire a plane to skywrite \\"Daniel Call Betty\\" in the sky over the retreat. Daniel dutifully contacts Betty and says he'll stop the shipment, but Wilhelmina convinces him otherwise, believing that the callousness of the cover would actually sell issues. The stunt works and results in their highest sales ever, but Betty is publicly blamed and labeled \\"Tornado Girl\\" after the media somehow discover she had final approval. Betty becomes a pariah and is very upset at the media attention and hate mail she receives from readers. After discovering from Marc that Daniel told Phil to ship the issue, Betty confronts Daniel. Daniel's conscience is pricked, and in a press conference, he finally takes the blame for okaying the issue and adds that he will donate all profits to the tornado victims. Molly, who saw the news conference, comes over to talk to Daniel to say she was impressed. Wilhelmina watches them and gets the idea to ask Connor to assist her with a last minute assignment. Meanwhile, Hilda starts an underground beauty salon with help from Justin when the city turns down her permit for a legal business, mostly because she's operating the business from the Suarez home. Unfortunately, as she and Betty went down to see Archie at his office to protest over her rejection, Archie is hesitant to help her obtain one, saying that \\"The law is the law.\\" This does not sit well with Ignacio, who tells Hilda that she should fight back after he witnesses his daughter's secret operations by having customers come in via code name. Later on that day Archie arrives at the Suarez household to offer her a compromise: If she earns 30 percent from any product she sells, then she can get a license to run her business as a boutique instead, so he suggests that she sells candles. Hilda takes the suggestion, and as Justin watches even asks him to stop by again if he was looking for a haircut. Later that evening Betty quizzes Marc about Cliff and the wedding proposal. Mark then comes clean to Betty about what he did that night at the rooftop party when he slept with another man, prompting Betty to tell Marc to do the right thing. Marc later admits to Cliff he crashed the car, and tells him about the one-night stand. Cliff walks away crying, unable to forgive Marc for what he did. Casting This episode introduces Sarah LaFleur as Molly for a recurring stint. Ashley Jensen is absent from this episode. This marks David Blue's last recurring episode. Reception \\"Willy goes hunting\\" was one way Tanner Stransky described this latest outing in Entertainment Weekly: \\"The scariest/most greatest thing ever happened on last night's Ugly Betty: Wilhelmina wielded a hunting rifle! And no, she wasn't using it to kill of any of her rivals at Mode. Although, she did threaten Claire with it once. But honestly, who knew Willy was a hunter? Of course, the situation brought about a plethora of great one-liners for the ferocious editrix, which brings us right to the issue at hand.

She and her husbands Ned Lyons, Jim Brady and Billy Burke were among the most sought-after career criminals in the U.S. and Canada, being wanted in several major cities including New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit and Montreal from the 1860s until the turn of the 20th century. She and Lyons were prominent underworld figures in New York City during the post-American Civil War era as associates of Marm Mandelbaum, Lyons being a member of Mandelbaum's \\"inner circle\\" during the 1860s and 1870s.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 197) She eventually retired from criminal life and spent her later years involved in the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents, and providing financial assistance and housing for reformed criminals and their families. Her autobiography, Why Crime Does Not Pay (1913), was published and distributed by publisher William Randolph Hearst.Indianapolis News. \\"Criminology: Sophie Lyons' Success\\". Vol. I. No. 1. South Whitney, Indiana: Atoz Printing Company, 1916. (pg. 14) Biography =Early life and criminal career= Lyons was Jewish. She was born in Lauben, Germany on December 22, 1847. Her mother taught her to pickpocket and shoplift and forced her out into the street to steal. Lyons claimed she had been first caught stealing at the age of three and was tried at the Essex Market police court,\\"Burglar Lyons's Family; The Depravity Of Its Youngest Member. He Abuses His Mother In A Police Court --Rewarding Her With Curses And Filthy Charges--Sorrows Of A Woman Who Was Reared In Crime\\". The New York Times, February 1, 1880 and she was again arrested for shoplifting at 12. Lyons married another pickpocket, Maury Harris, when she was 16, but the marriage ended when Harris was arrested and sentenced to New York State Prison for two years. During her youth, she became known as a skilled pickpocket and confidence woman. She was considered a consummate actress who, even when caught by her victim, was able to \\"counterfeit every shade of emotion\\" to persuade them to release her. According to one incident in 1880, she was able to convince a store detective that she suffered from kleptomania. Lyons eventually married Ned Lyons, known then as the \\"King of the Bank Robbers\\", and Sophie had six children during the marriage. Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a home from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so. In 1870 Ned was caught during an attempted bank robbery in Wyoming County, New York and sent to Auburn Correctional Facility. Sophie pulled strings to get him moved to Sing Sing prison, where security was more lax. However she was convicted of shoplifting and sent to Sing Sing herself in 1871. Using a disguise, Ned escaped from the prison in 1872. He returned a few weeks later and helped his wife escape and they fled to Canada with their children. =Court battle with George Lyons= On the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her oldest son, 14-year-old George, before the magistrate. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \\"was so generally unruly\\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile correctional facility. After she had finished, George shouted, \\"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in Montreal and elsewhere.\\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \\"recommendations showing his good character\\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \\"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a recess to listen to both mother and son in private. Lyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany, but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including Dan Kerrigan's infamous Sixth Street saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife. After hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on Montgomery Street and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his pocket watch, but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of child neglect and abandonment. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief. =Relocating to Detroit= By 1880 Lyons had split from Ned and moved her base of criminal operations to Detroit, partly due to the city's proximity to Canada. She spent much of the 1890s in the Midwest as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry. She returned to New York in 1895 and, after her arrest by police detective Stephen O'Brien, she was put under close police surveillance by Brooklyn detectives, under orders from Superintendent McKelvey. On the afternoon of June 21, 1896, Lyons entered a dry goods store at Sixth Avenue and Fourteenth Street. Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by store detective Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \\"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a streetcar, where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached Eighteenth Street, Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest. Lyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the Mercer Street police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in New Jersey, which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be remanded. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.\\"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\\". The New York Times, June 22, 1896 =Retirement and later years= Following her \\"retirement\\" from crime in 1913, Lyons wrote her memoir, Why Crime Does Not Pay, and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer in Detroit. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000\\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\\". The New York Times, April 13, 1913 (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents. The Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \\"character building\\" facility at Lafayette Boulevard on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \\"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\\"\\"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\\". The New York Times, February 3, 1916 In July 1922, the 73-year- old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,0007,000 in bonds and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to Put- in-Bay to find her house \\"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in Seattle. She commented to reporters, \\"I have no idea who did the 'job,' and I am unhappy to think that men would do such a thing to an old woman who devotes a large income to prison relief work.\\" She died on May 8, 1924, at the age of 75.

Political ideology Ackerman is an activist for left-wing causes and an active supporter of National Regeneration Movement (Morena), a political party, and of its leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He is married to Irma Eréndira Sandoval, a member of the cabinet as Minister of Public Administration. Ackerman defended the government of Nicolas Maduro, saying Venezuela was \\"much more democratic and respectful of human rights than Mexico\\". In the same article, published on La Jornada on 27 March 2017, Ackerman claims there is no electoral fraud in Venezuela, that there is constant media censorship in Mexico, that there are more political prisoners in Mexico than in any other Latin American country and that there is a clear separation of branches of government in Venezuela. He also claimed that Mexico is worse off than Venezuela in terms of corruption, poverty, inequality and violence.

It is a grade II* listed building, and takes its name from John le Gaunt who owned it in 1290. The mill was owned for four centuries by the Weston family and papers relating to the mill are now held in the Somerset Record office. Most of the machinery, including the grindstones, conveyors, sackhoist and grain bins, date from 1888 and is still used for grinding animal feed and occasionally whole wheat flour. A British Empire turbine by Armfields of Ringwood was also installed. Steam power was introduced in 1883, and replaced by semi-diesel in 1914. The South Somerset Hydropower Group was begun in 2001 and the first turbine, at Gants Mill, was commissioned in 2003. It was turned on by Adam Hart Davis on Friday 23 April 2004. It now produces up to 12kW of electricity from a 300mm crossflow turbine.Mirage and oasis: Energy choices in an age of global warming , New Economics Foundation, , published June 2005, accessed 2007-06-11 The system uses a crossflow turbine made by Valley Hydro of Cornwall, and has a maximum flow rate of 495 litres per second.

MES provides information that helps manufacturing decision makers understand how current conditions on the plant floor can be optimized to improve production output. MES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, personnel, machines and support services). MES may operate across multiple function areas, for example: management of product definitions across the product life-cycle, resource scheduling, order execution and dispatch, production analysis and downtime management for overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), product quality, or materials track and trace. MES creates the \\"as-built\\" record, capturing the data, processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process. This can be especially important in regulated industries, such as food and beverage or pharmaceutical, where documentation and proof of processes, events and actions may be required. The idea of MES might be seen as an intermediate step between, on the one hand, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or process control system on the other; although historically, exact boundaries have fluctuated. Industry groups such as MESA International—Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association were created in the early 1990s in order to address the complexity, and advise on execution, of MES Systems. Benefits \\"Manufacturing Execution Systems [help] create flawless manufacturing processes and provide real-time feedback of requirement changes\\", and provide information at a single source. Other benefits from successful MES implementation might include: # Reduced waste, re-work and scrap, including quicker setup times # More accurate capture of cost-information (e.g. labor, scrap, downtime, and tooling) # Increased uptime # Incorporate paperless workflow activities # Manufacturing operations traceability # Decreases downtime and easy fault finding # Reduced inventory, through the eradication of just-in-case inventory MES A wide variety of systems arose using collected data for a dedicated purpose. Further development of these systems during the 1990s introduced overlap in functionality. Then the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA) introduced some structure by defining 11 functions that set the scope of MES. In 2000, the ANSI/ISA-95 standard merged this model with the Purdue Reference Model (PRM).Johann Eder, Schahram Dustdar (2006) Business Process Management Workshops. p. 239 A functional hierarchy was defined in which MES were situated at Level 3 between ERP at Level 4 and process control at Levels 0, 1, 2. With the publication of the third part of the standard in 2005, activities in Level 3 were divided over four main operations: production, quality, logistics and maintenance. Between 2005 and 2013, additional or revised parts of the ANSI/ISA-95 standard defined the architecture of an MES into more detail, covering how to internally distribute functionality and what information to exchange internally as well as externally. Functional areas Over the years, international standards and models have refined the scope of such systems in terms of activities. These typically include:. * Management of product definitions. This may include storage, version control and exchange with other systems of master data like product production rules, bill of material, bill of resources, process set points and recipe data all focused on defining how to make a product. Management of product definitions can be part of product lifecycle management. * Management of resources. This may include registration, exchange and analysis of resource information, aiming to prepare and execute production orders with resources of the right capabilities and availability. * Scheduling (production processes). These activities determine the production schedule as a collection of work orders to meet the production requirements, typically received from enterprise resource planning (ERP) or specialized advanced planning and scheduling systems, making optimal use of local resources. * Dispatching production orders. Depending on the type of production processes this may include further distribution of batches, runs and work orders, issuing these to work centers and adjustment to unanticipated conditions. * Execution of production orders. Although actual execution is done by process control systems, an MES may perform checks on resources and inform other systems about the progress of production processes. * Collection of production data. This includes collection, storage and exchange of process data, equipment status, material lot information and production logs in either a data historian or relational database. * Production performance analysis. Create useful information out of the raw collected data about the current status of production, like Work In Progress (WIP) overviews, and the production performance of the past period like the overall equipment effectiveness or any other performance indicator. * Production track and trace. Registration and retrieval of related information in order to present a complete history of lots, orders or equipment (particularly important in health related productions, e.g. pharmaceuticals).  Relationship with other systems MES integrates with ISA-95 (previous Purdue Reference Model, “95”) with multiple relationships. =Relationship with other Level 3 systems= The collection of systems acting on the ISA-95 Level 3 can be called manufacturing operations management systems (MOMS). Apart from an MES, there are typically laboratory information management system (LIMS), warehouse management system (WMS) and computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). From the MES point of view possible information flows are: * To LIMS: quality test requests, sample lots, statistical process data * From LIMS: quality test results, product certificates, testing progress * To WMS: material resource requests, material definitions, product deliveries * From WMS: material availability, staged material lots, product shipments * To CMMS: equipment running data, equipment assignments, maintenance requests * From CMMS: maintenance progress, equipment capabilities, maintenance schedule =Relationship with Level 4 systems= Examples of systems acting on ISA-95 Level 4 are product lifecycle management (PLM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), human resource management (HRM), process development execution system (PDES). From the MES point of view possible information flows are: * To PLM: production test results * From PLM: product definitions, bill of operations (routings), electronic work instructions, equipment settings * To ERP: production performance results, produced and consumed material * From ERP: production planning, order requirements * To CRM: product tracking and tracing information * From CRM: product complaints * To HRM: personnel performance * From HRM: personnel skills, personnel availability * To PDES: production test and execution results * From PDES: manufacturing flow definitions, design of experiments (DoE) definitions In many cases, middleware enterprise application integration (EAI) systems are being used to exchange transaction messages between MES and Level 4 systems. A common data definition, B2MML, has been defined within the ISA-95 standard to link MES systems to these Level 4 systems. =Relationship with Level 0, 1, 2 systems= Systems acting on ISA-95 Level 2 are supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), programmable logic controllers (PLC), distributed control systems (DCS) and batch automation systems (BAS). Information flows between MES and these process control systems are roughly similar: * To PLCs: work instructions, recipes, set points * From PLCs: process values, alarms, adjusted set points, production results Most MES systems include connectivity as part of their product offering. Direct communication of plant floor equipment data is established by connecting to the PLC. Often, plant floor data is first collected and diagnosed for real- time control in a DCS or SCADA system. In this case, the MES systems connect to these Level 2 systems for exchanging plant floor data. Until recently, the industry standard for plant floor connectivity has been OLE for Process Control (OPC), but it is now moving to OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA); meaning that OPC-UA compatible systems will not necessarily run only on Microsoft Windows environment, but will also be able to run on GNU/Linux or other embedded systems, decreasing the cost of SCADA systems, and rendering them more open with robust security.

Originally written in 1945, but not approved for publication by Gen. Douglas MacArthur's military censors. The reports were collected and edited by the author's son Anthony Weller, and published for the first time in 2006.  Synopsis  The Occupation authorities declared Nagasaki (and Hiroshima) off-limits to reporters. Weller reports that he was the first outside observer to reach Nagasaki, on September 6, 1945, four weeks following the U.S. atomic bombing of the city. He spent a total of three weeks in Nagasaki and in the nearby Allied P.O.W. camps — some of which he \\"opened\\", and revisits the series of news reports he published at the time about his experiences. The first dispatches by non-Japanese reporters were filed by Associated Press correspondent Vern Haugland and New York Times Lawrence who visited Nagasaki September 9, 1945. Captain Joe Snyder, press officer with MacArthur headquarters, in his book Para(graph) Trooper For MacArthur: From the Horse Cavalry to the USS Missouri 1997 Chapter 16 \\"Nagasaki Inferno\\" pp199–209 describes \\"boarding a transport plane packed with reporters headed for Nagasaki.[for example: photographers 1. see Google image search Nagasaki Bernard Hoffman (LIFE Magazine) 2.

I toured the city with the AP's Jim Hutcheson, among others. He and I had become good friends since our narrow escape on Corregidor. ... There were thousands of stories in Nagasaki and our group saw many pitiful sights of people with radiation burns who, in dreadful agony, were slowly dying. The first thing Japanese doctors asked was if American doctors had a cure for the bomb's effects on the human body. ... We received a report from GHQ that American doctors were coming to Nagasaki soon....\\" Snyder acknowledges what he calls Wilfrid Burchett's \\"ingenuity\\" in successfully reporting from Hiroshima. Snyder does not mention George Weller or any dispatches of George Weller's from Nagasaki. Joe Snyder [1983; owner and editor of the North Missourian] and Walter Cronkite [1964; CBS] are both recipients of the Missouri School of Journalism Honor Medal. From the first days of the Occupation reporters were cleared to cover freeing and rescue operations on behalf of these prisoners. Weller comments: \\"What the command wanted covered was the prison camps of northern Japan. The dam was to be opened to one last orgy of home town stories, more mindless and more alike than the slow molasses drippings of four years of sloppy, apolitical, dear-mom war....I did not feel that the right way to end this war was to...chew more fodder about what-beasts-the-Japs-are and Jimmy-looks-skinnier-today.\\"[First into Nagasaki page 5 and 6] The U.S. military in Tokyo censored approximately 55,000 words of his dispatches, along with more than 100 photographs.[Acknowledgments pages 317-8 First into Nagasaki Edited and with an Essay by Anthony Weller] However, Weller does not refer to governmental censorship of any photographs of his related to Nagasaki. On January 7, 2009 the Telegraph published Nagasaki photographs dated September 5, 1945: \\"After we asked readers for stories and photographs relating to Britain at War, we received these fascinating photographs of Nagasaki and Hiroshima from Cecil A. Creber, who took them less than a month [Nagasaki = September 5, 1945] after the atom bombs were dropped on both cities [August 6 and 9 1945].\\" The Linlithgow Gazette November 28, 2008 \\"Amazing atomic aftermath pics set for key war archives\\" features a photo of Creber captioned \\"Life through a lens: Cecil with his faithful Ensign box camera.\\" On February 13, 2010 Mainichi published \\"New color footage of Nagasaki A-bomb devastation shows need for greater research resources\\" plus a 01/05/2010 Photo Special [film circa September 11, 1945 found at the United States National Archives in Washington D.C. by Professor Burke-Gaffney]. Weller writes these correspondents \\"looked like yacht passengers who have stopped to buy basketry on an island.\\" He writes that Colonel McCrary \\"offered to take carbons of my stories and file them when airborne.\\" The reporters under McCrary's leadership were not subject to censorship, making their dispatches especially valuable. Weller writes: \\"I refused.\\" \\"How could I close up my atomic laboratory, with the work only half finished?\\"...and concludes with the explanation that his refusal is because he wanted to write \\"something free, big and formal....something ample, leisurely and magnificent.\\" [First into Nagasaki page 19-20] Haugland of The Associated Press states: \\"We offered Weller a ride back to Tokyo with us,....\\"[see Haugland infra p. 20] Weller describes a feeling of \\"hopelessness\\" about his dispatches because the Kempeitai to whom he claims to have entrusted the stories had \\"returned to Nagasaki, but they had no message for me.\\"[First into Nagasaki page 21] Weller, although working as a reporter for a daily publication, chose to refuse an offered opportunity either to timely send his Nagasaki dispatches uncensored from the aircraft or alternatively to confront the Occupation censorship directly by filing in Tokyo, despite writing: \\"I wanted to be prepared to defend every line. If the stories were blocked as reprisal against me, I intended to take the case to MacArthur himself.\\"[First into Nagasaki page 18] Weller traveled to Nagasaki from Kanoya airbase with Sergeant Gilbert Harrison. Harrison's career later included: Chairman of the American Veterans Committee; editor and publisher of The New Republic magazine; author of several books. In Harrison's memoir [Parts of a Past iUniverse June 2009 pages 81–2] he describes carrying George Weller's Nagasaki reporting from an airstrip outside Nagasaki to the Chicago Daily News in Tokyo: A Boston Globe article by Gerald R. Thorp of the Chicago Daily News \\"TOKYO, Sept. 10(CDN) 'New Brand of Jap to Him!'\\" indicates that Harrison was by September 10, 1945 accompanying correspondents in Tokyo. The first dispatch presented in First into Nagasaki (see page 25 and photos on cover and back inside endpaper) is datelined Nagasaki September 6 and reads: ...\\"After a 24-hour trip on what seemed like dozens of trains, the writer arrived here this afternoon as the first visitor from the outside Allied world.\\" On September 6 the Chicago Daily News printed a dispatch under Weller's byline datelined Kanoya, which begins: The remainder of Weller's dispatch consists of a series of direct quotations from men of this medical corps with names, addresses, and photographs (these last are not from in Japan but are formal military portraits). Samples: After the September 6 dispatch from Kanoya, Weller's next dispatch was printed on September 12 with an \\"Ōmuta, Kyushu\\" dateline (Omuta was a prisoner of war camp approximately 100 miles by railroad from Nagasaki and twice that from Kanoya.

The New York Post on September 15, 1945 published an article by George Weller headlined \\"U.S. Prisoners Held at Nagasaki Describe Terrors of Atom Blast\\" using the same line of text as the Boston article (Dispatch #1), death statistics (Dispatch #3) and re-located position of POW camp (Dispatch #4). The New York article includes Weller's interviews with Captain Farley, Dr. Vink, Harold Bridgman, and Fred King (Dispatch #5). The article concludes with the bomb's \\"peculiar 'disease'\\" (Dispatch #8). The Miami Herald on September 18, 1945 published an article \\"By George Weller Miami Herald-Chicago Daily News Wire\\" headlined: \\"American Tells of Being Atomic Bombed\\" with quote above: \\"'I Hit the Ground...Building Began To Quiver'\\". In this article are quotations and statistical data from Dispatch #3 \\"The known dead number 20,000, Jap police tell me, and they estimate about 4,000 bodies remain to be found\\" along with \\"The wounded are estimated to be about twice the number of dead.\\" \\"Walk in Nagasaki's streets today and you walk in ruins.\\" (Dispatch #1) Also, Captain Farley's eyewitness account (Dispatch #5) is quoted. The interviews with Bridgman and King (Dispatch #5) are included as well as information from Dr. Nakashima (Dispatch #8) and the interview with the Japanese lieutenant, aide to the district commander (Dispatch #1). George Weller's own response \\"In hours of walking through these areas I experienced no burns or signs of debilitation.\\" is from Dispatch #3 (First into Nagasaki page 30) which mentions Weller's \\"nausea\\"http://resources.library.yale.edu:2007/u?/yale-ydn,12963 Yale Daily News Book Supplement April 30, 1979 page 7: Students plunge into writing careers ...For several Yale undergraduates, the imaginative impulse has been strong enough to yield written results. Both Gollin and Junior Anthony Weller produced two novels during their first two years at Yale....Real-life people and familiar scenes provide the basis for Weller's novels. He concentrates on telling the story and lets meanings work their way in surreptitiously. The writer's most difficult task is to be true to his characters, Weller believes. \\"A writer must think out vivid characters; he must know what they will say and how they will act. For example, a girl from Long Island would comment 'I feel a little nauseous' not just 'I feel nauseous.'\\" Weller plans his characters' actions like chess moves that have many repercussions. \\"The action keeps readers interested. They want to find out what events, cause changes in attitudes, rather than the thoughts of a character.\\" Writing his second novel, he encounters a dangerous urge to make it too complicated, too literary. He has spent two and a half years writing and revising his book about a college student who begins to face responsibilities involving other people, and must ponder what relation women will have to his life. Weller has already begun work on a third novel that's \\"less quiet\\" than the other two; it concerns a man whose best friend attempts to murder him. ... None of these students currently take any English or creative writing courses at Yale. ... Weller explains that he would not take a creative writing course because \\"there's a point when you have the urge to develop on your own -- without interference.\\" not reported in the Miami Herald article of 1945. The Miami Herald article incorrectly states atomic POW casualties \\"Forty-eight were killed instantly and four others died later.\\" while Dispatch #5 states \\"Forty-eight were wounded, four instantly killed, and four, including Aalders, died.\\" The incorrect POW casualty figures also appear in Weller's Los Angeles Times article of September 16, 1945 and his New York Post article of September 15, 1945, and his article in the Akron Beacon Journal headlined \\"Yank Saw Atom Bomb Wipe Out Nagasaki\\" and above that \\"It Was 'Terrific, White Flash'\\" September 15, 1945 (this article includes interviews supra from Dispatch#1, Dispatch#5, and Dispatch#8). The Associated Press' Vernon Haugland quotes Dr. Vink \\"only four of our 200 prisoners were killed\\"[outright when the bomb exploded; four more died subsequently] in article published widely, including in the New York Times and on September 10, 1945 in the Miami Herald. Thus papers in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Akron all print Weller's incorrect casualty statistics, whilst Dispatch#5 gives correct data, as does the Associated Press in 1945. Eight Dispatches (pages 25–45) are described in First into Nagasaki as written in Nagasaki September 6–9 with Weller \\"sending them off to MacArthur's military censors in Tokyo, hopeful that they were being cabled onward to his editors at the Chicago Daily News and thence to a vast American readership via syndication. These dispatches have remained unpublished for sixty years; it appears that the U.S. government destroyed the originals.\\" The fact of publication by the Los Angeles Times, Boston Evening Globe, New York Post, Miami Herald, and Akron Beacon Journal is irreconcilable to George Weller's assertion that: \\"...I sent 25,000 words by the hands of the obliging kempeitai, the secret police, directly to MacArthur. ... All my dispatches were suppressed. Every one of my 25,000 words was killed by MacArthur's censorship, which went on afterward, month after month.\\"[First into Nagasaki page 313] Censorship of correspondents reporting from Japan for newspapers outside Japan ended October 6, 1945, continuing only for the Japanese media. In The Weller Dispatches by Anthony Weller[page 291 First into Nagasaki] is statement that \\"...the editors cut Weller's cynical closing phrase....\\" The Chicago Daily News text last line is: \\"That's how Jap wardens cured decadent Americans, but lost the war.\\" The Miami Herald text last line is: \\"That's how Japanese wardens cured decadent Americans but lost the war--so it says here in fine print.\\" On September 18, 1945 the Miami Herald published article by George Weller \\"Japan Holds Prisoners In Secret\\" on Chinese prisoners on Kyushu, based on information source Lt. Edward Little (later court-martialled for crimes while a POW. This article has close to identical text with the article included in Weller's War pages 618-9 and there described as: \\"This dispatch was censored by MacArthur and never published.\\" The Los Angeles Times on September 29, 1945 printed another article \\"By George Weller Chicago Daily News Foreign Service Nagasaki September 28 Californians Worked to Death on Dam by Japs.\\" Most of this article printed in the Los Angeles Times is contained in the dispatch dated September 24, 1945 published in First into Nagasaki pages 139-143. For sixty years Weller's own carbon of these dispatches were presumed lost, until they were discovered by Weller's son, Anthony, six months after George Weller's death.Anthony Weller, The Weller Dispatches by Anthony Weller pages 305-6 First into Nagasaki, Edited and with an Essay by Anthony Weller: VII  Controversies  = Title claim, who was first = Weller claims that he was \\"the first Westerner to enter either of the bombed cities after Japan surrendered\\" Chicago Daily News August 14, 1965 page 20 and that \\"No other correspondent had yet evaded the authorities to reach either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.\\"First into Nagasaki page 3 However, other reports note people entering the city as early as August 22, and the earliest dispatch from Weller was dated September 6 (see below). Australian journalist Wilfrid Burchett arrived in Hiroshima on September 3, 1945, and a Hiroshima dispatch from him was printed September 5, 1945 in the London Daily Express.Robert Manne Quadrant August 1985 (reprinted in Left Right Left: Political Essays 1977-2005 \\"He Chose Stalin: The Case of Wilfrid Burchett\\"); The Monthly June 2008; Tibor Méray On Burchett 2008 George Weller: \\"...I entered it [Nagasaki] on September 6, 1945, as the first free westerner to do so after the end of the war.\\" [page 3] \\"...the writer arrived here [Nagasaki] this afternoon as the first visitor from the outside Allied world.\\" [page 25] \\"...the writer--the first Allied observer to reach Nagasaki since the surrender--...\\" [page 43] Anthony Weller: \\"...no outsider had been in yet, not even from the U.S. military.\\" [pages 245-246] Weller [Part I First into Nagasaki in the book First into Nagasaki page 3] writes: \\"Whenever I see the word 'Nagasaki,' a vision arises of the city when I entered it on September 6, 1945, as the first free westerner to do so after the end of the war. No other correspondent had yet evaded the authorities to reach either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.\\" However, the Chicago Daily News on August 30, 1945 published under size extra large headline: \\"1st INSIDE STORY OF HIROSHIMA Reporter Tells How City Vanished in Atom Blast\\" a notable scoop by Leslie Nakashima written for United Press (and also printed in the New York Times \\"Newsman finds all of Hiroshima gone after atom blow.\\") Born in Hawaii and previously a reporter for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and a foreign correspondent with wire agency UP in pre-war Tokyo this Nisei's dispatch includes: \\"...I arrived at Hiroshima at 5 A.M. Aug. 22, to find out about my mother, who lived in the outskirts of the city. Alighting from the train, I found that Hiroshima station—once one of the largest in western Japan—no longer existed. ...The sight before me as I headed for the outskirts of the city where my mother lived was unbelievable. It was unbelievable because only a fortnight before the bombing I had seen the city intact when I evacuated my wife and two daughters to central Japan. Except for one or two bombs dropped on separate occasions by B-29's, Hiroshima had not been subjected to heavy incendiary attacks. ...But I found my mother safe. She had been weeding grass in a relative's vegetable field about two miles southeast of the city when she saw the flash....A school in the suburbs near mother's home has been converted into a field hospital to care for people who suffered burns. The majority of these cases is believed hopeless. Many of the victims are unidentifiable. Even now two or three patients are dying daily at this one hospital.\\" And the Chicago Daily News published a dispatch by Associated Press war correspondent Vern Haugland on page one under size large headline: \\"U.S. Writer Views Hiroshima\\" Continued dispatch section headline: \\"First U.S. Reporter Sees Hiroshima Ruins.\\" Correspondents from the Headliner- Dateliner group with Lt. Col. John 'Tex' McCrary of the Strategic Air Forces visited both Hiroshima (September 4–5) and Nagasaki (September 8–9), publishing a series of thorough and informative dispatches which covered both atomic cities and included medical aspects. = Parachutes = Several of the eyewitnesses Weller interviewed described seeing a parachute, or parachutes, falling on the day of the bombing. In an account published more than twenty years after his visit to Nagasaki, Weller asserts that the bomb which destroyed Nagasaki was a \\"lazy-falling missile floating under a parachute.\\"\\"...riding under a silk handkerchief.\\" [First into Nagasaki page 3] Since the bomb did not descend by parachute (a fact well known twenty years later) this description is incorrect. Parachutes were attached to instruments were dropped by support-planes during the mission to measure the effects of the blast.Q&A; about the atomic bomb, Chugoku Shimbun, 2007 = pre-atomic raids on Nagasaki = In the same 1967 account Weller asserts that Nagasaki, prior to August 9, 1945 \\"...in the face of all logic, it had been spared so far....Streams of B-29s flowed north and south around it, but this prime target remained mysteriously untouched.\\" First into Nagasaki page 14-15 Weller offers several theories connected with the supposed sparing of Nagasaki. Contrary to George Weller's unaccountable assertion that Nagasaki before August 9, 1945 was \\"mysteriously untouched\\", Nagasaki had in fact been targeted in August 1945, August 1944,New York Times front page headline: \\"JAPANESE, SUMATRA, PHILIPPINE PORTS BOMBED\\" article headlined: \\"Palembang, Main Japanese Oil Center, and Nagasaki Swept by Great Waves of Fire\\" [08/11/1944] text: \\"rained bombs for one and one-half hours on industrial targets at Nagasaki\\" [08/12/44] as well as the April 1945 raid which became famous as \\"The legend of Lieut. Gene Flewellen and his B-29, the Experiment Perilous...a 'one-plane air force.'\\" [New York Times 05/01/1945]. On, August 10, 1944 Nagasaki had been bombed by B-29s \\"launched from China against Nagasaki's urban area. The twenty-four attacking bombers unloaded 4 tons of fragmentation bombs and 77 tons of incendiaries on the primary. There is an element of foreshadowing in the fact that Nagasaki was the first Japanese city to be attacked and firebombed by AAF 'precision' bombers, in view of what the city was to experience almost one year later.\\" [Blankets of Fire: U.S. bombers over Japan during World War II Smithsonian Institution Press 1996 Kenneth Werrell page 105] On April 27, 1945, Lieut. Gene Flewellen commanding the B-29 Experiment Perilous was forced by weather to abandon his original target on Kyūshū and, without accompanying aircraft, flew southward down the coast seeking a target of opportunity and bombed the Nagasaki dock area. The absence of anti-aircraft fire indicated that the Japanese were \\"entirely surprised. The lone B-29 wheeled and headed south. Several hours later the pilot put the huge craft down at Saipan, with ten minutes of gas left in his tanks.\\" New York Times May 1, 1945 Delayed George Jones by wireless \\"B-29, twice astray, looses solo blows On August 3, 1945 New York Times had carried the front page headline \\"BOMBERS FIRE GREAT NAGASAKI SHIPYARDS\\" and a page one story beginning \\"Nagasaki, one of the three major shipbuilding centers of Japan and ninth port of the empire, was left aflame yesterday, its dockyards smashed and its harbor littered with sunken ships by over 250 planes of General George C. Kenney's Far East Air Force.\\" The article continues with a full description of the air battle over Nagasaki, and the destruction of oil tanks, ships, warehouses and railyard. The raid of August 2, 1945 included Mitchell and Liberator bombers as well as Thunderbolt and Mustang fighter planes. Weller's assertion published in 1967 is not consistent with this prominent, lengthy and detailed New York Times coverage, nor with his own assertion published in 2006 at the end of the very first dispatch datelined Nagasaki (September 6, 1945 2300 hours) that the city had had \\"one earlier serious raid.\\" First into Nagasaki page 27  References   External links  * John Callaway with Anthony Weller on First Into Nagasaki, Pritzker Military Museum & Library, March 1, 2007 * Anthony Weller: Weller's War: A Legendary Foreign Correspondent's Saga of World War II on Five Continents, Pritzker Military Museum & Library, April 30, 2009 *After Words interview with Weller on First Into Nagasaki, January 6, 2007 Category:Nagasaki Category:Books about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Category:1945 documents Category:2006 non-fiction books ","title":"First Into Nagasaki"},{"id":"20018207","text":"The Parthe is a river in Saxony, Germany, right tributary of the White Elster.

Jutland During the Battle of Jutland, Petard was one of ten destroyers of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to screen the 1st Battle Cruiser Squadron, following the lead of light cruiser . The first engagement of the battle was between a British force of six battlecruisers and four battleships and lighter vessels commanded by Admiral Beatty and a German squadron of five battlecruisers plus accompanying vessels commanded by Admiral Hipper. At 4.15pm on 31 May 1916, the opposing fleets sent their destroyers in to deliver a torpedo attack on the opposing line. Petard was one of eight destroyers of the 13th flotilla to respond, along with three destroyers of other formations.Admiralty. Battle of Jutland: Official Despatches, p. 8. The opposing destroyers fought a gun battle in hopes of blunting the enemy's torpedo attack while striving to deliver their own. Petard fired a torpedo on a high speed setting at a group of four German destroyers, possibly achieving a hit from about 3,000 yards range, and a second at a slower speed against the German battlecruisers from a range of about 9,000 yards. Petard then turned roughly parallel to the German battlecruisers but slightly converging, so as to get ahead of the column before once more turning towards the enemy to fire the remaining two torpedoes. Petard reported that her torpedoes must have crossed the enemy line, but did not claim a hit.Admiralty. Battle of Jutland: Official Despatches, p. 9. Turning back towards the British ships, Petard passed , which was also returning but at reduced speed because of damage. It now became apparent that further German ships were approaching, which proved to be the main German High Seas Fleet. Proceeding, Petard approached an oil slick where was picking up survivors from the battlecruiser , sunk by German gunfire, and picked up one man. Approximately 20 survivors in total were rescued from the 1000 man crew. Petard then returned to her station at the head of the battlecruiser line.

Hancock is best known as being the sport's first fourth threequarter player, which changed the formation of rugby union play that lasts to the present day. His role in the development of rugby was recognised by the International Rugby Board in 2011 with induction to the IRB Hall of Fame. Rugby career Hancock first played rugby in Somerset, and captained his local club and represented the Somerset county team. He moved to Cardiff to become involved in his family's brewing company, which had a brewery in Cardiff. He joined the Cardiff team in 1884 and was placed at centre as a replacement for the injured Tom Williams.Jones (1985), pg 14. Hancock had an inspiring game and scored two tries, which left the Cardiff committee with a problem as they wanted to keep their original back players but also wished to play Hancock. The club decided to instead change the balance of the team, from three threequarters to four threequarters. It was a successful tactic and Cardiff stuck with it for the remainder of the 1883/1884 season.Thomas (1979), pg 10. Within two months of moving to Wales, Hancock was playing for Cardiff, changed the future formation of rugby and was then selected to play for Wales. He played his first international game under the captaincy of Joe Simpson against Ireland as part of the 1884 Home Nations Championship. Wales won the game with tries from William Norton and Tom Clapp, and Hancock was reselected for the very next Welsh game against England in the next years tournament. Hancock played two games in the 1885 Championship, a loss to England at St Helens and a scoreless draw in Scotland. In 1885 Hancock was elected as captain of Cardiff, and he revolutionised the way the team played. He discouraged kicking and made the team focus mainly on try scoring through the forwards gaining the ball for individual play from the backs. Traditionally the forwards in a rugby side would retain the ball, engaging in prolonged scrums and mauls.Hignall, (2007) p.164 Hancock encouraged his forwards to release the ball to the half-backs, and they in turn would neither run nor kick the ball away, but would move the ball out to the centres. The centres job was, through low accurate passing to, transfer the ball to the wings who should take the ball on the run. Solid passing was primary in Hancock's vision of winning through scoring tries. In the 1885/86 season Cardiff scored a remarkable 131 tries but not a single penalty or drop goal. It is said that Hancock aggressively shouted down one of this team who attempted a drop goal during a game. Hancock was single minded and dictatorial in his approach as a captain, but his tactics were extremely successful, winning all bar one game and seeing just four tries scored against them. Hancock's first and only international match as captain was against Scotland in the 1886 Home Nations Championship. With the power of captaincy, Hancock tried out his four three- quarter system, the first time this had been done in an international. Hancock was paired up with Welsh rugby superstar Arthur Gould, but the poor selection of the team resulted in Hancock scrapping the system during the game and switched Gould to full-back; but the damage was already done and Wales lost the match. The trial was judged a failure and the four three-quarter system was dropped for several years.Thomas (1979), pg 11. Hancock retired from rugby at the end of the 1885/86 season at the age of 26. Hancock's son, Ralph, played first-class cricket for Somerset in a few matches before the First World War. His brother Froude Hancock was also a notable rugby player. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 466. * 1885 * 1884 * 1885, 1886 Bibliography  Prescott, Gwyn, This Rugby Spellbound People: Rugby Football in Nineteenth-Century Cardiff and South Wales.

In 1921, a conversation between Ralph Lane Polk II and Alfred P. Sloan (who later became president of General Motors) helped fuel R. L. Polk & Company's entry into the automotive industry. During the conversation, Sloan asked Polk to impartially tabulate and publish statistical information on cars and trucks in operation. R.L. Polk & Company launched its motor vehicle statistical operations in 1922, when the first car registration reports were published.https://web.archive.org/web/20071116145915/http://www.salesforce.com/customers/business- services/case-studies/rlpolk.jsp Retrieved on 11/4/08 In 1922, R.L.

Hinshelwood began his career as apprentice with Nottingham Forest on leaving the FA School of Excellence, one of his duties being to walk Brian Clough's dog. He won England Youth honours and an FA Youth Cup winners' medal while at Forest, turning professional in December 1992. He found it impossible to break into the first team at the City Ground and left on a free transfer in February 1996, joining Portsmouth. He made his league debut later that season, but after five games for Pompey fell out of the reckoning and joined Torquay United on loan on 2 March 1997, playing six games for Kevin Hodges' side. He was released by Portsmouth at the end of the following season, joining Brighton & Hove Albion on a short-term contract in August 1998, but was released by the Seagulls in January 1999. He joined Bognor Regis Town, moving on to Havant & Waterlooville in October 1999 before being appointed player- manager of Selsey on 7 January 2000. He transformed the Selsey side, his success leading to offers from bigger sides. In 2003, Selsey won the John O'Hara League Cup, but he quit the club in July that year after his budget for the following season had been considerably reduced. He subsequently returned to manage Selsey in April 2004. In 2007, Hinshelwood was appointed as assistant manager of the Sussex County side, combining this post with his duties at Selsey. He left Selesey in November 2009. His father Martin Hinshelwood played professionally for Crystal Palace, among others, and was Brighton's Director of Youth Football while he was at the club. His younger brother Scott was an apprentice with Portsmouth and played under him for Selsey, as did their cousin Marc, the son of Paul Hinshelwood, the former Crystal Palace and Millwall player.

It serves Orange County and Greater Los Angeles. Rev. Young Sun Lee serves as the president of the Korean Gospel Broadcasting Network, which owns the station. KGBN is one of four radio stations in the Los Angeles area that broadcast entirely in Korean. The others are 1230 KYPA, 1540 KMPC and 1650 KFOX in Torrance, although they have mostly secular formats. KGBN broadcasts with 20,000 watts by day. But to protect other stations from interference on AM 1190, power is reduced at night to 1,300 watts. It uses a directional antenna at all times. The transmitter is near the Orange Freeway (California State Route 57) in Brea, California.Radio-Locator.com/KGBN History =KEZY= The station signed on May 18, 1959 as KEZY, an easy listening station known as \\"K-Easy\\". However, during construction and prior to its on-air debut, it was legally known by the call letters KDOG. The first voice heard over the 1,000-watt signal was that of K-9 TV star Lassie. Lassie's owner, Rudd Weatherwax, was an investor in both the station and the Disneyland Hotel where its studios were located. In the late 1960s, KEZY became an Orange County Top 40 powerhouse featuring such disc jockeys as Mark Denis and Mike Wagner. Accompanying the format flip was a move off the Disneyland campus to a larger facility at 1190 East Ball Road in Anaheim, an address corresponding to the station's frequency. In the late 1970s, programmer Dave Foreman dropped top-40 in favor of an album-oriented rock format. The slogan was \\"The New 1190 KEZY, Anaheim's Kickass Rock 'N' Roll!\\", which contrasted with KEZY 96 FM's AC format and a then now legendary and infmaous slogan, \\"While 96 KEZY-FM kicks back, 1190 KEZY-AM KICKS ASS!\\" The oft repeated bumper played during the non top of the hour breaks was a group of KEZY-AM's listeners shouting out the mighty battlecry that is, \\"K-E-Z-Y-AM 1190 ROCK! WHERE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KICKS ASS!!!\\" After a few years the station once again changed formats, first to news (as KNWZ), then to an adult rock format known simply as \\"12\\" (\\"KEZY Anaheim is 12.\\") This format was abandoned in the early 1980s and it become a highly successful Top 40/CHR format from 1980 to 1988. =1980s= Around 1984, KEZY changed its call sign to KPZE (K-Praise). It featured a blend of Christian teaching–preaching programs, contemporary Christian music, and live broadcasts of the games of the Long Beach State and Notre Dame football programs. The Program Director was Bill Gutelman, and the Operations Director was Gil Perez. Other staff–air personality included Pam Sanchez (mornings-air name Stephanie Rose), Paul Walkewicz (weekends), Bill Smith (weekends), Liz Altamirano, and former KYMS personality Bob Turnbull. Turnbull hosted an evening program called \\"Ministry And More,\\" similar to his \\"Music and More\\" program on KYMS. In addition to playing music, he would have \\"Thoughts To End A Busy Day,\\" and book reviews. From 1986 to late 1988 Operations Manager and air personality Robin Keith hosted an afternoon drive talk show called \\"Drivetime 1190\\" along with co-host Steve DeSaegher. The show featured talk and call-ins, comedy, frequent traffic, news and weather reports as well as interviews with celebrities and experts. Ollie Collins, Jr., of KTYM Inglewood, brokered most of the Sunday hours on KPZE. The morning consisted of a Gospel music show hosted by Collins. Most of the afternoon programs were recorded church services. A good majority of the commercials used his voice. Al Gross (formerly of KBRT AM 740), eventually hosted the morning show. His was mostly talk. He even joked one morning at 6:00 AM sign-on, as the previous program was ending with its closing theme, \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" by The Hollies, \\"KPZE, Anaheim, playing more music than any other talk station.\\" Around 1988, the call letters were changed to KORG (K-Orange). It broadcast a few games of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team during conflicts with KLAC, the Kings' flagship station at the time. In fact, in one of those games (October 15, 1989), Wayne Gretzky established the National Hockey League's all-time point-scoring record. In 1987 and '88, KORG was an affiliate of RTV Sports, one of the first all-sports radio networks in America. Steve DeSaeger provided local sports updates during RTV programs, which aired seven nights a week. =1990s= In the mid-1990s, Anaheim Broadcasting, a local company that had been the owner, sold the station to Jacor, which later merged with Clear Channel Communications. In 1997, Clear Channel sold KXMX to the Salem Media Group because it had exceeded the Federal Communications Commission limit as to how many stations it could own in the greater Los Angeles market. (Anaheim is still in business as the owners of FM stations KOLA and KCAL in the Inland Empire.) Salem is the nation's largest owner of commercial religious stations. It owned 1190 AM until 2010, as a sister station to 870 KRLA, 99.5 KKLA-FM and 95.9 KFSH-FM. =2000s= The KXMX call sign was derived from KXMX-FM, originally 95.9 KEZY- FM. When that outlet became Contemporary Christian music station KFSH The Fish in 2001, the call letters were reassigned to 1190 AM. Today, the KEZY call sign can be found on 1240 AM in San Bernardino, California under separate ownership. As KXMX, it aired shows in a variety of languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. =2010s= In August 2010 the station was sold to the Korean Gospel Broadcasting Network, which switched the format to Korean-language Christian radio programming. On March 29, 2011, KXMX changed its call letters to KGBN. On April 16, 2017, Rev. Young Sun Lee became president of KGBN AM 1190.

In 1911 he flew the first cargo flight in Britain, transporting electric light bulbs from Shoreham to Hove. He was also the first person in Great Britain to gain an aeronautical degree. Biography Barber was one of the first aviation pioneers and within a few years of the first powered flight he leased a railway arch in Battersea to design and produce aircraft. In 1909 he moved to Lark Hill on Salisbury Plain and formed the Aeronautical Syndicate Limited to produce his designs. In early 1910 he began to fly his designs and in late September 1910 he became the first occupant of Hendon Aerodrome, newly established by the London Aerodrome Co, where he leased three hangars.Opening of the Bleriot School Flight 8 October 1910 His ASL Valkyrie design started test flying from there in October 1910, Barber using the aircraft to gain his Aero Club Certificate (No. 30) in November of that year.\\"The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom OFFICIAL NOTICES TO MEMBERS\\" Flight 26 November 1910 p. 997 The company gave four Valkyries to the government and one aircraft and military pilot were lost in an accident in September 1911. Barber carried on with some experimental work, producing a tractor biplane called the ASL Viking early in 1912, but in April 1912 he dissolved the Syndicate, having failed to achieve any commercial success. The company's aircraft and equipment were sold, mostly to Frederick Handley Page. Barber continued to work as an aeronautical consultant, with an office at 59 Pall Mall in London. In 1912 he tried to insure himself against any liability from passengers of his aircraft, this was unknown at the time and Lloyd's asked him to write his own policy, the first aircraft insurance policy. Barber served in the First World War in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and later the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was one of the first flying instructors at Shoreham and he also invented a number of training aids. In 1917 he published a book The Aeroplane Speaks and in 1927 Aerobatics.

Tracy Seyfert (born December 2, 1941) is a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 5th District from 1997 through her resignation in 2000. Seyfert attended Mountain View Joint Schools. She earned her undergraduate degree from Villa Maria College (now part of Gannon University), her M.A. from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, and a Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh in 1988. She worked as a psychologist before joining the Erie County, Pennsylvania Council. Seyfert won election in 1996, running on her experience as a member of the Erie County, Pennsylvania Council and her pledge to reduce the size of the Pennsylvania state government. Arrest and Trial On September 9, 1999, federal and state investigators raided Seyfert's home, located in \\"Tracy's Ridge\\" in Millcreek Township, Pennsylvania, and seized a 10-ton (1,500 kilowatt) generating unit and 500-gallon oil tank. New units of that size cost $160,000 and require a crane and flatbed truck to move and are capable of supplying power to a coal mine, a lumber yard, or emergency power to the USX Tower. The total value of the units was less than $1,000. Prosecutors alleged that in April 1999, Seyfert enlisted Elk Creek Township Supervisor Harold \\"Frosty\\" Crane to help her acquire the equipment, which was slated to be transferred to a volunteer fire department. Individuals are prohibited from acquiring such equipment through this program. It is unclear what she wanted with the non-functioning unit, though employees suggested it was back up power for when the power grid might fail during the Y2K scare, in which all the computers in the world would malfunction.

The judge sentenced her to five years in federal prison and assessed a $5,000 fine. Seyfert was released from federal prison on March 20, 2001. Joseph Wenzel, a former legislative aide and close associate of Seyfert, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to tamper with a witness in Seyfert's trial.

It was founded in 1871 as Maschinenbau A.G. Humboldt, liquidated due to debts in 1884 and reformed as Maschinenbauanstalt Humboldt A.G.. Its predecessor was a company run by Wimmar Breuer, who had manufactured perforated plate in Kalk since 1853. It was expanded in 1856 by Breuer and shareholders, Neuerburg and Sievers, into the Maschinenfabrik für den Bergbau von Sievers & Co. at Kalk near Deutz am Rhein. In 1896, under the name of Maschinenbauanstalt Humboldt, locomotive construction was begun. To that end, the site of a bankrupt engineering works in Güstrow was procured and, on 24 September 1898, the first steam locomotive was delivered. Amongst others, the company built 81 units of the Prussian S 6 locomotive from 1911 to 1913 as well as some 77 units of various Prussian G 5 locomotive variants. On 22 December 1924 a shareholding agreement was concluded with the Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz AG. In 1925 the Öllokomotivenbau (Oil Locomotive Works) resulted, in which Humboldt, the Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz and the locomotive works of Henschel & Sohn at Kassel had shares. After building just one locomotive, however, the company was dissolved again in 1928. That same year Humboldt ceased locomotive production, after having delivered over 1700 locomotives, due to a lack of orders. On 17 October 1930, Humboldt merged with the Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz to form Humboldt-Deutz- Motoren. In 1938 the Isselburger Hütte was taken over, and a deal with the Klöckner Werke resulted in the famous name of Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD). Today part of that name still appears in the firm KHD Humboldt Wedag International, a cement plant and equipment supplier that was formerly part of Deutz AG.

Early life Wood was the youngest of four sons born to Daniel Halsey Wood and Hannah Lippincott Wood. Shortly after his birth in 1855, the family relocated from Dansville, New York to Newark, New Jersey, where Daniel Wood's company manufactured varnish. Family spiritual life centered around the House of Prayer, an Anglo-Catholic congregation where the children were introduced to ritualist liturgy and William became a member of the choir, eventually serving as its director.Memories of William Halsey Wood, by Mrs. William Halsey [Florence Hemsley] Wood (1938; Philadelphia, privately printed) Wood prepared for the architectural profession in a typical nineteenth-century pattern of practical experience and apprenticeship. During an unspecified time circa 1880, he is reported to have traveled to England and gained employment in the office of George Frederick Bodley, a leading figure in the High-church or Anglo-Catholic movement within the Anglican Communion.The domestic architecture of William Halsey Wood, by R. Craig Miller (1972, M.A. Thesis). Miller suggests this English sojourn occurred in the 1870s, but a sketchbook in the William Halsey Wood Papers at the New-York Historical Society includes English sketches dated August 1881. Wood may have made multiple trips to England. The Bodley connection is consistent with Wood's youthful experience at the House of Prayer, and that, with other family connections to the High Church party within Anglicanism, ultimately contributed to the character of Wood's own mature work. On November 19, 1889, Wood married Florence Hemsley, a Philadelphian and member of the Church of St. James the Less in that city, one of the most prominent Anglo-Catholic congregations in America. The Woods bore three children: Emily (1890), William Halsey, Jr. (1892), and Alexander (1894). Career From his practice in Newark, New Jersey, Wood focused on two characteristic building types of the late 19th century: large single- family residences and ecclesiastical designs principally for the Episcopal Church. The young architect's earliest documented commissions are an 1878 house for his older brother D. Smith Wood and the William Clark House of 1879, both in Newark. There followed a variety of residential work, from a modest duplex for speculative investment to large suburban homes and urban townhouses. Three of his suburban homes were featured in Artistic Country- Seats by G. W. Sheldon, an 1886 publication that included work by McKim, Mead & White, Wilson Eyre and other notable turn-of-the-century designers. Wood's largest home, \\"Yaddo\\", was built in Saratoga Springs, New York for New York financier and philanthropist Spencer Trask and his wife Katrina Trask; \\"Yaddo\\" continues in use today as the home of a working colony of artists and writers. Andrew Carnegie was also his client; the initial 1889 portion of the Carnegie Free Library of Braddock, Pennsylvania, the first of Carnegie's 1,679 public libraries in the U.S.A. to open (1889) and the second to have been commissioned (1887), is Wood's design. It is believed that Wood met Carnegie through William Clark, also a Scottish immigrant.* Wood's submission to the competition for Carnegie's larger library in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now Pittsburgh's North Side), the first of his libraries in the United States to be commissioned (1886) and the second to open (1890), was very favorably received, but ultimately was not selected. While the architect's clients and projects varied widely, church clients formed the largest part of Wood's practice, especially for his own denomination. From 1885 until his death Wood designed more than forty churches and parish buildings, all but four of them for Episcopal congregations. The rural Church of St. John the Evangelist (1885), at Hunter/Tannersville, New York, for example, was designed for Wood's own family as a seasonal parish without resident clergy; Wood and his wife Florence Hemsley married there in 1889,The National Register nomination supports the attribution of this design to Wood. However, William Morgan's study of contemporary architect Henry Vaughan (1845-1917) (The Almighty Wall) links the building with Vaughan with Wood's own brother Rev. Alonzo Lippincot Wood conducting the service and the bishop of Tennessee in attendance. The modest \\"Queen Anne\\" or \\"Eastlake\\" design, built of local granite boulders and wood-frame construction, expressed ecclesiological design principles promoted by the Oxford Movement. Wood's architecture can be seen in this drone shot of Christ Episcopal Church in Bloomfield & Glen Ridge. Wood's masterpiece in New Jersey, still a vital congregation, is the First Baptist Peddie Memorial Church on Military Park in Newark (1888). Though often seen as being heavily influenced by Richardson, the massive two-towered building is really a nod toward twentieth century expressionism, its abstract masses seeming to burst from their bases like missiles from silos. There is nothing like it anywhere in the United States--National Romantic churches in Scandinavia are its closest contemporary designs. Also unique is its domed interior, designed to allow full immersion baptisms to occur while no less than three choirs sang in lofts directly above the pool. Its pulpit was also specially equipped for long Sunday sermons; Wood designed a press box adjacent to the elaborately carved aerie so that reporters could follow the preacher and file stories on the sermons for their Monday editions. The entire interior is wood paneled, and the carving is among the most elaborate in any church of its time. Only Richardson's Trinity Church in Boston matches its design in quality and material splendor. At the opposite extreme, Wood entered and was one of four finalists in the competition for New York City's Cathedral of St. John the Divine, an unsuccessful proposal that would have been larger than any of its European counterparts. More typical examples of his work were for urban congregations in Newark, Passaic, Paterson and other communities in northeastern New Jersey and in New York City. One of these is Christ Episcopal Church in Bloomfield & Glen Ridge. The geographic range of Wood's client list was also wide, including commissions in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Missouri and Wyoming. His most distant commission was for Saint John's University, Shanghai, China. Two of these commissions were cathedrals: St. Mary's at Memphis, Tennessee and St. Matthew's at Laramie, Wyoming. With few significant deviations, these churches were \\"Gothic Revival\\" or \\"Richardsonian Romanesque\\" in style and adhered closely to liturgical design principles promoted by the High Church party and its publishing organs The New-York Ecclesiologist and, later, The Churchman. Assessment In March 1897, Wood died from tuberculosis at the Philadelphia home of his father-in-law, Alexander Hemsley. He was buried in the churchyard of St. James-the-Less, a traditional Anglo-Catholic congregation in keeping with his own churchmanship. Wood died during an important transition in American architecture; a shift from the exuberance—some have said excesses—of nineteenth-century eclecticism to the functionally based perspectives of twentieth-century Modernism. Even during his own lifetime, Wood was seen as a participant in that process of transition. The next generation of architects and architectural critics, however, discounted his career as derivative, seeing only the historicist aspects of the architect's work, his reliance upon Medieval prototypes and imagery. Architect and preservationist James Marston Fitch, for example, dismissed Wood and other Richardsonians altogether: \\"...some of them, like Halsey Wood’s grotesque mimicry of H. H. Richardson’s Trinity, make one flinch at their awfulness\\".American Architecture: the historical forces that shaped it, by James M. Fitch (1966; Houghton Mifflin.) One of the first to re- appraise Wood in a more positive light was the early 20th century medievalist, Ralph Adams Cram, himself a competitor for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Writing ten years after Wood's death, Cram observed \\"...he thought Gothic as instinctively as the best thirteenth-century master-mason of them all\\", and that \\"religious architecture staggered under the blow\\" when Wood died at the age of 41.The Gothic Quest, by Ralph Adams Cram (1907; New York, The Baker and Taylor Company.) Almost three decades later, Cram's enthusiasm was unabated, writing \\"For my own part I think Halsey Wood was potentially one of the greatest architects of modern times\\".My Life in Architecture by Ralph Adams Cram (1936; Boston, Little Brown & Co.) Another positive assessment came in 1936 from architectural critic and urban theorist Lewis Mumford, whose writings were instrumental in understanding the 1880s \\"as the seedbed of modern architecture\\". In \\"The Sky Line\\", his regular column in The New Yorker, Mumford linked Wood with H. H. Richardson and others who had lain the groundwork for Modernism.Lewis Mumford,\\"The Sky Line,\\" The New Yorker, February 29, 1936.

Accurate wind resource assessments are crucial to the successful development of wind farms.  History  Modern wind resource assessments have been conducted since the first wind farms were developed in the late 1970s. The methods used were pioneered by developers and researchers in Denmark, where the modern wind power industry first developed.  Wind resource maps  Wind resource map for the Philippines, from the Global Wind Atlas High resolution mapping of wind power resource potential has traditionally been carried out at the country level by government or research agencies, in part due to the complexity of the process and the intensive computing requirements involved. However, in 2015 the Technical University of Denmark, under framework of the Clean Energy Ministerial, launched the Global Wind Atlas (version 1.0) to provide freely available data on wind resource potential globally. The Global Wind Atlas was relaunched in November 2017 (version 2.0) in partnership with the World Bank, with wind resource maps now available for all countries at 250m resolution. Another similar international example is the European Wind Atlas, which is in the process of being updated under the New European Wind Atlas project funded by the European Union. Examples of country wind resource maps include the Canadian Wind Atlas, the Wind Resource Atlas of the United States, and a series of wind maps published by the World Bank under an initiative launched by ESMAP in 2013 focused on developing countries.https://esmap.org/re_mapping This followed a previous initiative of the United Nations Environment Program, the Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) project, which was launched in 2002 with funding from the Global Environment Facility. However, these country wind resource maps have been largely superseded by the Global Wind Atlas in terms of data quality, methodology, and output resolution. The above global and country mapping outputs, and many others, are also available via the Global Atlas for Renewable Energy developed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which brings together publicly available GIS data on wind and other renewable energy resources effort. Wind prospecting can begin with the use of such maps, but the lack of accuracy and fine detail make them useful only for preliminary selection of sites for collecting wind speed data. With increasing numbers of ground-based measurements from specially installed anemometer stations, as well as operating data from commissioned wind farms, the accuracy of wind resource maps in many countries has improved over time, although coverage in most developing countries is still patchy. In addition to the publicly available sources listed above, maps are available as commercial products through specialist consultancies, or users of GIS software can make their own using publicly available GIS data such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory's High Resolution Wind Data Set.http://www.nrel.gov/gis/data_wind.html Although the accuracy has improved, it is unlikely that wind resource maps, whether public or commercial, will eliminate the need for on-site measurements for utility-scale wind generation projects.http://www.awea.org/faq/wwt_basics.html However, mapping can help speed up the process of site identification and the existence of high quality, ground-based data can shorten the amount of time that on-site measurements need to be collected. In addition to 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution.  Measurements  To estimate the energy production of a wind farm, developers must first measure the wind on site. Meteorological towers equipped with anemometers, wind vanes, and sometimes temperature, pressure, and relative humidity sensors are installed. Data from these towers must be recorded for at least one year to calculate an annually representative wind speed frequency distribution. Since onsite measurements are usually only available for a short period, data is also collected from nearby long-term reference stations (usually at airports). This data is used to adjust the onsite measured data so that the mean wind speeds are representative of a long-term period for which onsite measurements are not available. Versions of these maps can be seen and used with software applications such as WindNavigator.  Calculations  The following calculations are needed to accurately estimate the energy production of a proposed wind farm project: * Correlations between onsite meteorological towers: ** Multiple meteorological towers are usually installed on large wind farm sites. For each tower, there will be periods of time where data is missing but has been recorded at another onsite tower. Least squares linear regressions and other, more wind-specific regression methods can be used to fill in the missing data. These correlations are more accurate if the towers are located near each other (a few km distance), the sensors on the different towers are of the same type, and are mounted at the same height above the ground. * Correlations between long term weather stations and onsite meteorological towers: ** Because wind is variable year to year, and power produced is related to the cube of windspeed, short-term (< 5 years) onsite measurements can result in highly inaccurate energy estimates. Therefore, wind speed data from nearby longer term weather stations (usually located at airports) are used to adjust the onsite data. Least squares linear regressions are usually used, although several other methods exist as well. * Vertical shear to extrapolate measured wind speeds to turbine hub height: ** The hub heights of modern wind turbines are usually 80 m or greater, but developers are often reluctant to install towers taller than 60m due to the need for FAA permitting in the US, and costs. The power law and log law vertical shear profiles are the most common methods of extrapolating measured wind speed to hub height. * Wind flow modeling to extrapolate wind speeds across a site: ** Wind speeds can vary considerably across a wind farm site if the terrain is complex (hilly) or there are changes in roughness (the height of vegetation or buildings). Wind flow modeling software, based on either the traditional WAsP linear approach or the newer CFD approach, is used to calculate these variations in wind speed. * Energy production using a wind turbine manufacturer's power curve: ** When the long term hub height wind speeds have been calculated, the manufacturer's power curve is used to calculate the gross electrical energy production of each turbine in the wind farm. * Application of energy loss factors: ** To calculate the net energy production of a wind farm, the following loss factors are applied to the gross energy production: *** wind turbine wake loss *** wind turbine availability *** electrical losses *** blade degradation from ice/dirt/insects *** high/low temperature shutdown *** high wind speed shutdown *** curtailments due to grid issues  Software applications  Wind power developers use various types of software applications to assess wind resources. = Wind data management = Wind data management software assists the user in gathering, storing, retrieving, analyzing, and validating wind data. Typically the wind data sets are collected directly from a data logger, located at a meteorological monitoring site, and are imported into a database. Once the data set is in the database it can be analyzed and validated using tools built into the system or it can be exported for use in external wind data analysis software, wind flow modeling software, or wind farm modeling software. Many data logger manufacturers offer wind data management software that is compatible with their logger. These software packages will typically only gather, store, and analyze data from the manufacturer's own loggers. Third party data management software and services exist that can accept data from a wide variety of loggers and offer more comprehensive analysis tools and data validation. = Wind data analysis = Wind data analysis software assist the user in removing measurement errors from wind data sets and perform specialized statistical analysis. = Atmospheric simulation modeling = Wind flow modeling methods calculate very high-resolution maps of wind flow, often at horizontal resolution finer than 100-m. When doing fine resolution modeling, to avoid exceeding available computing resource, the typical model domains used by these small-scale models have a few kilometers in the horizontal direction and several hundred meters in the vertical direction. Models with such a small domain are not capable of capturing meso-scale atmospheric phenomena that often drive wind patterns. To over come this limitation nested modeling is sometimes used. = Wind flow modeling = Wind flow modeling software aims to predict important characteristics of the wind resource at locations where measurements are not available. The most commonly used such software application is WAsP, created at Risø National Laboratory in Denmark. WAsP uses a potential flow model to predict how wind flows over the terrain at a site. Meteodyn WT and WindStation are similar applications that use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations instead, which are potentially more accurate, particularly for complex terrains. = Wind farm modeling = Wind farm modeling software aims to simulate the behavior of a proposed or existing wind farm, most importantly to calculate its energy production. The user can usually input wind data, height and roughness contour lines, wind turbine specifications, background maps, and define objects that represent environmental restrictions. This information is then used to design a wind farm that maximizes energy production while taking restrictions and construction issues into account. There are several wind farm modeling software applications available, including ZephyCFD, Meteodyn WT, Openwind, Windfarmer, WindPRO, WindSim, and WAsP. = Medium scale wind farm modelling = In recent years a new breed of wind farm development has grown from the increased need for distributed generation of electricity from local wind resources. This type of wind projects is mostly driven by land owners with high energetic requirements such as farmers and industrial site managers. A particular requirement from a wind modelling point of view is the inclusion of all local features such as trees, hedges and buildings as turbine hub-heights range from as little as 10m to 50m. Wind modelling approaches need to include these features but very few of the available wind modelling commercial software provide this capability. Several work groups have been set up around the world to look into this modelling requirement and companies including Digital Engineering Ltd (UK), NREL (USA), DTU Wind Energy (Denmark) are at the forefront of development in this area and look at the application of meso-CFD wind modelling techniques for this purpose.

It is a story about corrupt police officers, exploitation of an innocent girl and media's fight to expose the facts. A girl seeks help after her father's death from the Higher-ranking officer. He takes advantage of the girl and makes her his kept women. The situation becomes intolerable when the officer starts sending his other police friends to the girl. The girl finally gets help from a news channel to perform a sting operation on him. This is the story of how the news channel used this operation for their own motives and how finally justice was served. Plot It is believed that 'Media' is the fourth pillar of democracy. Journalism began as a mission, then a service and now merely a profession – a complete business where a struggle is not to get right news but rather to 'generate' one crammed with glamour and sensation. The film endeavors to uncover the darker side of the famous or infamous sting operations where a news correspondent (Vidya) falls in the 'chakravyu' of the whole business and finally paves her way out to yet another 'chakravyu'. The film narrates the story of a girl who initially is acknowledged when she is one among the corrupt system and discarded and criticized when she starts rebelling. Vidya is a young, dynamic, self-motivated news correspondent, who has just come out of a journalism course and is all charged to take up confrontations of this profession. But, little did she know that it is not as effortless job as it is perceived. Vidya initially is covering the entertainment beat and is quiet contended with her piece of work. But due to certain shuffles she is forced to quit entertainment and cover crime, which she presumes as not her cup of tea. Gradually, she gets a knack of it and starts getting addicted to the thrill and ecstasy of the job. She gets a brilliant story for her channel all the way from Rajasthan along with her teammates which actually boosts the TRP ratings of the channel and also her morale. In the process, or rather, in the quest for the thrill, she even tries to fool around with the so-called ethics and codes of journalism by creating situations to get a story for her channel. One day she receives a call, that later changes her overall approach towards this profession. It is a call from a girl, Sangeeta, from Pune, who is a victim of repeated sexual abuses by the high designators of the local Police. Vidya, with her team chalks out a plan for yet another sting and is ready to cover the event where the SP is assaulting Sangeeta. But unfortunately it is the DIG who falls prey to their sting. The whole episode of 'live rape' disconcerts Vidya and her cameraman Rafiq to an extent that they feel ashamed to be merely a spectator in this profession where they couldn't even save the victim. But this event is not less than a celebration to the news channel where this 'Breaking news' will be their USP. Vidya has promised Sangeeta that this footage will not be telecast but rather be kept for her defense in court. Unfortunately, Vidya is traumatized to see the telecast of the whole footage 'as it is' in her news channel irrespective of her caution to the editor. Bugged with the whole system, she leaves for her Uncle's place who had been insisting her to visit his small press. There she apprehends the genuine power and nuance of journalism and gets the spur to fight back the system. With her, is a close friend Bala (a crime correspondent in rival channel), Rafiq (the cameraman) and Trishna (her batch mate in journalism course) who differ in their ideologies and yet are together. This is the time when she gets emotionally attached to the whole ball game and decides to give the victim Justice. In her fight for justice she faces all the ups and downs but all in vain leaving Vidya in utter despair and gloom. The USP of the film is in exposing reality with certain humorous incidence that occurs within the news channels. From the agitated talk shows to shoving the mike in the mouth of a kissing couple in a park and asking 'what is your take on right to privacy' is being presented in a unique style.

He is known for his work with children from disadvantaged and troubled homes, having rehabilitated tens of thousands of youth through his educational network founded in 1972. Biography Grossman is a sixth-generation Jerusalemite and the scion of a prominent Hasidic family. His father, Rabbi Yisrael Grossman, served as rosh yeshiva of Pinsk-Karlin and of Chabad in Lod, and was a member of the rabbinical court of Agudat Yisrael. His mother, Perl (1923-2012), was the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Gutfarb, a teacher at the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem. He is one of six brothers and four sisters.\\"Tribute: Rebbetzin Perl Grossman, a\\"h\\". Hamodia, 15 March 2012, pp. C10-C13. Retrieved 1 April 2012. He grew up in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem and attended Yeshivas Karlin.Marks, Yehudah. \\"The Shliach Tzibbur's Secret\\". Hamodia, Israel News, 13 September 2012, p. A29. An alumnus of Slabodka yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Grossman received rabbinical ordination in 1966. Desiring to do religious outreach in one of Israel's secular neighborhoods, he moved to the Lower Galilee town of Migdal HaEmek in 1968. Migdal HaEmek was founded in 1953 to help absorb the mass aliyah of Sephardi Jewish immigrants from North Africa, Migdal HaEmek's population growth drastically outpaced its socioeconomic and educational infrastructure. With a shortage of jobs and dearth of schools, the town was plagued by widespread crime and alcohol and drug abuse. Grossman, looking every inch the Hasidic rabbi with his beard and sidelocks, embarked on a one-man campaign to rehabilitate Sephardi youth immersed in crime and drug use. He went straight to the pubs and discos where idle youth from distressed homes were hanging out and gained their trust with love and caring. In 1970 Israeli television dubbed him the \\"Disco Rabbi\\". In 1969, one year after his arrival, the town unanimously elected him Chief Rabbi of Migdal HaEmek, giving him lifetime tenure. At age 23, he was the youngest municipal Chief Rabbi in Israel. In 1972 Grossman founded the Migdal Ohr (Tower of Light) educational network to give children a loving and caring environment at the age of 6 or 7 so that they could circumvent the cycle of crime and drug abuse that plagued the town's teens and adults. The year of its founding Migdal Ohr enrolled 18 students. By its second year it had doubled in size. Migdal Ohr now enrolls over 6,000 boys and girls in 15 high schools and elementary schools and seven daycare centers occupying a campus. As of 2013, it had educated over 17,000 children; one graduate, formerly a 12-year-old dropout, went on to become a member of Knesset. Through his discussions with youth, Grossman found out that many children had a father or brother in prison. In 1974 he initiated Shaked - Rehabilitation Through Religion, now operating in all Israeli prisons, which has reduced the recidivism rate of its participants to 20 percent. This program gives over 900 inmates, mostly jailed for drug-dealing and armed robbery, the choice to study in a prison kollel on a voluntary basis for three to four hours a day. Rabbis and teachers deliver shiurim (Torah classes) and build the prisoners' Torah knowledge, while at the same time mentoring the prisoners' families to prepare a new support system after release. Participants have one-third of their sentence reduced for good behavior. Hundreds of released inmates have become ba'alei teshuva (returnees to the faith) through this program and work as rabbis, Torah teachers, and kollel students. For his contribution, Grossman received the honorary title of Avi Ha'asirim (Father of the Prisoners) from the Israeli government, a title originally bestowed on Rabbi Aryeh Levin.\\"The Power of Spiritual Rehabilitation\\". Hamodia, 13 February 2004, p. 10. Grossman has been offered the position of Chief Rabbi of Israel twice, but declined both times in favor of continuing his outreach work in Migdal HaEmek. =2006 Lebanon War= Lighting the Hanukkah candles (2008). During the 2006 Lebanon War, Grossman used his location in the north of Israel to provide services to soldiers suffering from the government’s inefficient handling of troops and supplies. In one instance, he opened the Migdal Ohr campus to 700 Israeli paratroopers of the IDF Brigade 85 who were stranded in a tank hangar in Petah Tikva, hosting them for swimming, a barbecue and dancing with live Hasidic music. In another case, he let 600 members of the 8th Paratrooper Battalion use Migdal Ohr as their home base during the three weeks of the war, supplying clean clothing, new gear, and use of the recreational facilities. He also arranged a Hachnosas Sefer Torah ceremony for them and blessed them with safety and success. When the war ended, he invited all 600 soldiers back to Migdal Ohr for another party. =Maccabi preseason exhibition game= A preseason exhibition game between the Israeli Maccabi team and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden is one of Migdal Ohr's biggest fund-raising events. In 2009, Grossman's attempt to mediate the ejection of the Israeli coach resulted in coverage in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the New York Post, and other papers. = Malka Leifer and Eliezer Berland advocacy = In March 2018, Grossman testified for bail to be given in the case of former school principal Malka Leifer, who is accused of rape and 74 counts of sexual abuse incidents at Adass Israel School in Melbourne. Leifer has been avoiding extradition to Australia. Leifer's husband, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef (Jacob) Leifer, also fled to Israel with her, where he now heads the small Chust Hassidic community in Emmanuel, where his wife has been living and was arrested. On March 7, 2018, Grossman argued that it was a \\"humiliation\\" for Leifer to remain in custody while awaiting trial and she was released to his custody. A backlash ensued, and Grossman withdrew his support of Leifer, who was then imprisoned. Migdal Ohr claims child protection on its agenda, and the Israeli government is its major funder. Migdal Ohr also relies on substantial funding from foreign governments, nonprofit organizations, and private donors; the United States, among others, demanded that Grossman rescind support for Leifer. Fairfax Media reported that, according to sources interviewed, Grossman was aware of the allegations from 2012, and supported Leifer; “Rabbi Grossman didn't have a moral realisation”, the source said. “He didn't issue an apology for the hurt caused”. Leifer at the time was also awaiting trial in Israel for fraudulently claiming mental illness and incapacitation in order to avoid extradition. In 2016, Grossman twice appeared before a court in South Africa to negotiate the release from prison of former Shuvu Banim Torah Academy school dean Rabbi Eliezer Berland, who later confessed to rape and assault. Awards Israeli Minister of Education Yuli Tamir, 2008. In 1983 Grossman received the Love of Israel award from the President of Israel, Chaim Herzog. In October 1991 he was honored with the Tolerance Prize, presented by Knesset chairman Dov Shilansky at a special parliamentary ceremony. In 2004 Grossman received the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State of Israel. The Caring Institute named him International Humanitarian of the Year in 2009. Grossman received an honorary doctorate from Bar-Ilan University in 2006. In 2013 Grossman was awarded the Presidential Medal of Distinction by President of Israel Shimon Peres. Family Grossman and his wife, Esther, have five children. He is the uncle (by marriage) of Rivka Holtzberg, co-director of the Nariman House Chabad center, who was murdered together with her husband Gavriel in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks.

It was subsequently purchased in the seventeenth century by Royalist Robert Cullum, a former Sheriff of London. Experts in Suffolk county history as well as noted authorities in antiquarian and botanical matters, the Cullum family of eight successive baronets authored works on the county and its fauna and flora. Sir Thomas Gery Cullum, a Charterhouse graduate, medical doctor and member of the Royal Academy and the Linnean Society, was a well-regarded author on science and botany. History Lords of the manor of Hardwick, the Cullum family lived at Hardwick House for almost three centuries, from 1656 until the 1920s, producing a line of baronets who were physicians, botanists, antiquarians, authors, horticulturalists, ministers and two of whom served as Bath King of Arms for the Order of the Bath for nearly 60 years. Ultimately, the Cullum family estate was sold during the Depression of the 1920s when the last family member died without direct heir, and it was later dismantled for building materials in 1926-1927. Hardwick House was built on what were formerly the medieval grazing lands of St Edmundsbury Abbey, which were sold during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Eventually the properties fell to Sir Robert Drury of nearby Hawstead Place, a former moated manor now demolished. The Drury family lived at Hawstead for 150 years before Sir Robert - who had removed his paintings and furniture to his newly built Hardwick House in 1610 - died in 1615 and the eldest line of the Drury family became extinct. The only standing remains of Hawstead are the brick gate pillars at the entrance to the manor and some other brickwork and the moat: however the painted emblematic panels of the last Lady Drury's private oratory or chamber of meditation were transferred to Hardwick,Cullum, Sir J., History and Antiquities of Hawstead and Hardwicke (1813). and are now kept at Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich.D.C.

Queen Elizabeth I spent one night at Hawstead Place in 1578, when she was said to have knighted the owner, Sir William Drury, after he restored to her the silver-handled fan she had dropped into the moat at Hawstead Place. The Hawstead and Hardwick Estates were sold by the heirs of Robert Drury in 1656 to Sir Thomas Cullum, first Cullum Baronet who had grown rich as a London draper and been Sheriff of London in 1646. Interior of Elizabethan Hardwick House, showing staircase. Circa 1900 Hardwick House, standing one and a half miles south of Bury, was a Jacobean house of 1612 thought to have incorporated the medieval Abbey Lodge and featured a bold portico entrance with enormous carved oak doors and the Drury coat of arms carved above the doorway.Roberts, W. M. Lost Country Houses of Suffolk (2010). The House was embroidered over the centuries by the Cullums who added gables, towers, ornate cut flint Tolkiensian cottage confections, gazebos, fountains, statuary and planting. Hardwick eventually was expanded to include seven principal bedrooms, nine bachelors rooms and secondary bedrooms, twelve servants' bedrooms and three bathrooms. With its bibliophile owners, the home had several libraries. (Most of the library collection, the 'Cullum Collection', was later donated to the Bury St Edmunds Record Office, where it remains.) Hardwick House also had an extensive collection of portraits, one of which was of Sir Thomas Gargrave, a once-powerful Yorkshire knight related to Sir Thomas Gery Cullum's wife's family. The Cullum family portraits were bequeathed to the Borough of St Edmundsbury in 1921 by the last surviving member of the Cullum family. The extensive grounds of Hardwick House were largely the creation of Sir Dudley Cullum, owner of the manor between 1680 and 1720, a keen horticulturalist and the only member of the Cullum family to be an MP - he served as a Whig for Suffolk from 1702-05\\\\. The house had a kitchen garden and several other gardens: an Italian garden with rosery and flowerbeds; a lime and sycamore tree-lined avenue; and a large 'pleasure grounds', with gazebos, and planted with exotic trees and shrubs. The kitchen garden also had pear, peach, plum, apple, cherry, and fig trees. The so-called 'Winter Garden,' also created by Sir Dudley, had a range of glass greenhouses for his horticultural pursuits, as well as a conservatory and orangery, palm house, peach house and a vinery. Group portrait at Hardwick House, 1876 The gardens at Hardwick were created, in part, by the English horticulturalist and gardener John Evelyn, who consulted on them with his friend Dudley Cullum. In a letter to Evelyn of 1694, Cullum expressed his delight at the effectiveness of the stove which heated his greenhouses. The Hardwick Estate eventually came to embrace a small village of properties, including adjoining farms and cottages built by the Cullum baronets on the initial holding. A smaller gardeners cottage adjacent to walled garden of Hardwick House was eventually expanded to be a full-scale home in its own right (known as Hardwick Manor from 1926). Hardwick became so elaborate that it came to include a Venetian indoor riding school, also being the centre of a busy social scene, with fox hunting parties often gathering on the Cullum estate. Hardwick Manor House, one of many homes on the estate of now-demolished Hardwick House Suffolk MP Thomas Milner Gibson, who lived at Theberton House, Suffolk, married Arethusa Susannah, the daughter of Rev Sir Thomas Gery Cullum, 8th and last Baronet and High Sheriff of Suffolk. Their son, the last of the senior line of the Cullums, was the well-known antiquarian and author George Gery Milner-Gibson- Cullum (1857-1921), F.S.A..George Gery Milner-Gibson-Cullum at wikisource The house was ultimately dismantled following his death in 1921, the estate having been passed to the Crown and sold under the Intestates Estates Act 1884. The grounds and site of the formal gardens and statuary today constitute Hardwick Heath ( of the former Cullum estate turned into public parkland), Bury St Edmunds District Scouts Hardwick Heath Campsite, the West Suffolk Hospital, the grounds of Hardwick Manor and housing developments. The site of Hardwick House itself is a wood bordering some original cedar and yew trees. Many of the Drury family, as well as the Cullums, are buried at All Saints' Church in Hawstead, which has many remarkable memorials.

Album information Writing and recording sessions for Death Is My Only Friend lasted for almost two years, making it the longest time Death by Stereo has ever spent making an album. Writing for the follow-up to Death for Life began in the summer/fall 2006 while original guitarist Jim Miner and original drummer Jarrod Alexander would reunite with the band to work on the album. It was confirmed by frontman Efrem Schulz that this album would be recorded with two drummers, Alexander and Chris Dalley (from Ten Foot Pole). Dalley, who had toured with the band for the last few months since the departure of longtime drummer Todd Hennig, will be doing the bulk of future tours, while Alexander tours with his post-Death by Stereo band A Static Lullaby. Schulz also confirmed that Miner will be doing random, but will not be doing full tours while promoting this album. However, he would only be writing and recording the album, only months after his recent wrist surgery.

Giachetti (2010). Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Methods, and Architecture. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. An enterprise is a complex, socio-technical system that comprises interdependent resources of people, information, and technology that must interact with each other and their environment in support of a common mission. According to Kosanke, Vernadat and Zelm, enterprise engineering is an enterprise life-cycle oriented discipline for the identification, design, and implementation of enterprises and their continuous evolution, supported by enterprise modelling. The discipline examines each aspect of the enterprise, including business processes, information flows, material flows, and organizational structure.Jan Dietz (2006). Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Enterprise engineering may focus on the design of the enterprise as a whole, or on the design and integration of certain business components.De Vries, Marne, Aurona Gerber, and Alta van der Merwe. In: Aveiro D., Tribolet J., Gouveia D. (eds) \\"The Nature of the Enterprise Engineering Discipline.\\" Advances in Enterprise Engineering VIII. Springer International Publishing, 2014. p. 1-15.  Overview  In theory and practice more types of enterprise engineering have emerged. In the field of engineering, a more general form of enterprise engineering has emerged.Enterprise Engineering Research at Royal Holloway led by Dr Alan Pilkington, Ver 9.08. Accessed 4 November 2008. Encompassing \\"the application of knowledge, principles, and disciplines related to the analysis, design, implementation and operation of all elements associated with an enterprise. In essence this is an interdisciplinary field which combines systems engineering and strategic management as it seeks to engineer the entire enterprise in terms of the products, processes and business operations,\\". this field is related to engineering management, operations management, service management and systems engineering. In the context of software development, a specific field of enterprise engineering has also appeared that deals with the modelling and integration of various organizational and technical parts of business processes and functions.Vernadat, F.B. (1996) Enterprise Modeling and Integration: Principles and Applications. Chapman & Hall, London, . In the context of information systems development, this has become an area of activity for the organization of systems analysis, and an extension to the existing scope of Information Modelling.J. A. Bubenko (1993). \\"Extending the Scope of Information Modelling\\". In: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on the Deductive Approach to Information Systems and Database Systems, Costa Brava, Catalonia. 1993. It can also be viewed as an extension and generalization of the systems analysis and systems design phases of the software development process.Gustas, R and Gustiene, P (2003) \\"Towards the Enterprise engineering approach for Information system modelling across organisational and technical boundaries\\", in: Proceedings of the fifth International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, vol. 3, Angers, France, 2003, pp. 77-88. Here, enterprise modelling can form part of the early, middle and late information system development life cycle. Explicit representation of the organizational and technical system infrastructure is being developed in order to understand the orderly transformations of existing work practices. This discipline is also known as Enterprise architecture, or along with Enterprise ontology, defined as being one of the two major sub- fields of Enterprise architecture.  Methods  Enterprise engineering involves formal methodologies, methods and techniques which are designed, tested and used extensively in order to offer organizations reusable business process solutions: *Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations *Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open Systems Architecture (CIMOSA) methodologyBeekman, (1989); European Committee for Standardization, ECN TC310 WG1, 1994 *Integrated DEFinition (IDEF) methodologyU.S. Airforce (1981); ICAM architecture part 1, Ohio, Air Force Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson *Petri Nets Peterson J.L. (1981); Petri net theory and the modeling of systems, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice Hall. *Unified Modeling Language (UML) or Unified Enterprise Modeling Language (UEML)Marshall, C. (2000); Enterprise Modelling with UML, , Addison-Wesley, MA.Vernadat F.B.; A vision for future work of the task force (IFAC-IFIP). *Enterprise Function Diagrams (EFD) These methodologies, techniques and methods are all more or less suited to modeling an enterprise and its underlying processes. = Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations = DEMO is a methodology for designing and engineering of organizations. Central concept is the \\"communicative action\\": communication is considered essential for the functioning of organizations. Agreements between employees, customers and suppliers are indeed created to communicate. The same is true for the acceptance of the results supplied. The DEMO methodology is based on the following principles: * The essence of an organization is that it consists of people with authority and responsibility to act and negotiate. * The modeling of business processes and information systems is a rational activity, which leads to uniformity. * Models should be understandable for all concerned. * Information should 'fit' with their users. The DEMO methodology provides a coherent understanding of communication, information, action and organization. The scope is here shifted from \\"Information Systems Engineering\\" to \\"Business Systems Engineering\\", with a clear understanding of both the information and the central organizations. = Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open Systems Architecture = CIMOSA provides templates and interconnected modeling constructs to encode business, people and information technology (IT) aspects of enterprise requirements. This is done from multiple perspectives: Information view, Function view, Resource view and Organization view. These constructs can further be used to structure and facilitate the design and implementation of detailed IT systems. The division into different views makes it a clarifying reference for enterprise and software engineers. It shows information needs for different enterprise functions such as activities, processes and operations alongside their corresponding resources. In this way it can easily be determined which IT system will fulfill the information needs of a particular activity and its associated processes. =IDEF= IDEF, first developed as a modeling language to model manufacturing systems, has been used by the U.S. Airforce since 1981 and originally offered four different notations to model an enterprise from a certain viewpoint. These were IDEF0, IDEF1, IDEF2 and IDEF3 for functional, data, dynamic and process analysis respectively. Over the past decades a number of tools and techniques for the integration of these different notations have been developed incrementally. IDEF shows how a business process flows through a variety of decomposed business functions with corresponding information inputs, outputs and actors. Like CIMOSA, it also uses different enterprise views. Moreover, IDEF can be easily transformed into UML-diagrams for the further development of IT systems. These positive characteristics make it a powerful method for the development of Functional Software Architectures. =Petri Nets= Petri Nets are established tools used to model manufacturing systems.Silva, M. and Valette, R. (1989); Petri nets and Flexible manufacturing. Lecture Notes on Computer Science, 424, 374–417. They are highly expressive and provide good formalisms for the modeling of concurrent systems. The most advantageous properties are the ability to create simple representation of states, concurrent system transitions and capabilities thereby allowing modelling of the duration of transitions. As a result, Petri Nets can be used to model certain business processes with corresponding state and transitions or activities therein as well as outputs. Moreover, Petri Nets can be used to model different software systems and transitions between these systems. In this way programmers can use it as a schematic coding reference. In recent years research has shown that Petri Nets can contribute to the development of business process integration. One of these is the \\"Model Blue\\" methodology developed by IBM's Chinese Research Laboratory. Model Blue outlines the importance of model driven business integration as an emerging approach to building integrated software platforms.Zhu et al. (2004); Model-driven business process integration and management: A case study with the Bank SinoPac regional service platform, IBM Corporation, Res. & Dev. Vol. 48 No. 5/6. The correspondence between their Model Blue business view and an equivalent Petri Net is also shown, which indicates that their research has closed the gap between business and IT. However, instead of Petri Nets the researchers instead use their own Model Blue IT view, which can be derived from their business view through a transformation engine. =Unified Modeling Language (UML)= Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a broadly accepted modeling language for the development of software systems and applications. Many within the Object-oriented analysis and design community also use UML for enterprise modeling purposes. Here, emphasis is placed on the usage of enterprise objects or business objects from which complex enterprise systems are made. A collection of these objects and corresponding interactions between them can represent a complex business system or process. While Petri Nets focus on the interaction and states of objects, UML focuses more on the business objects themselves. Sometimes these are called “enterprise building blocks” and includes resources, processes, goals, rules and metamodels.Eriksson & Penker (1998); UML Toolkit, Wiley, New York. Despite the fact that UML can be used to model an integrated software system, it has been argued that the reality of business can be modeled with a software modeling language. In response, the object oriented community makes business extensions for UML and adapts the language accordingly. Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is derived from UML and is proposed as a business modeling language. The question remains as to whether this business transformation is the correct method to use, as it was earlier said that UML in combination with other “pure’ business methods may be a better alternative. =Enterprise Function Diagrams= EFD is a used as a modeling technique for the representation of enterprise functions and corresponding interactions. Different business processes can be modeled in these representations through the use of “function modules” and triggers. A starting business process delivers different inputs to different functions. A process flowing through all the functions and sub-functions creates multiple outputs. Enterprise Function Diagrams thereby provide an easy-to-use and detailed representation about a business process and its corresponding functions, inputs, outputs and triggers. In this way EFD has many similarities with IDEF0 diagrams, which also represent business processes in a hierarchical fashion as a combination of functions and triggers. The two differ in that an EFD places the business functions in an organization hierarchical perspective, which outlines the downstream of certain processes in the organization. On the other hand, IDEF0 diagrams show the responsibilities of certain business functions through the use of arrows. Furthermore, IDEF0 provides a clear representation of inputs and outputs for every (sub)function. EFD may be used as a business front-end to a software modeling language like UML and its major similarities to IDEF as a modeling tool indicate that this is indeed possible. However, further research is needed to improve EFD techniques in such a way that formal mappings to UML can be made.Kim & Weston & Hodgson & Lee (2002); The complementary use of IDEF and UML. Information system engineering, Deajon University South Korea, Computers & Industrial Engineering 50, 35–56. Research on the complementary use of IDEF and UML has contributed to the acceptance of IDEF as business-front end and therefore a similar study should be carried out with EFD and UML.

The Clarks envisioned a school that would extend Treetops’ ideals of “personal choice balanced by vibrant community” and “time outdoors for meaningful work, unstructured play and discovery” into classroom learning.http://northcountryschool.org/middle-school-boarding-school/our- history/ Today, North Country School enrolls 90 students and offers a rigorous and progressive academic curriculum and opportunities for students to engage with the natural world, including: garden and farm projects, maple sugaring, chores, wilderness trips, and horseback riding.

He served in a Panzer Battalion and was promoted Oberstleutnant in 1939, Oberst in September 1941 and Generalmajor in September 1943. He was injured in 1944 by the 20 July plot bomb at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia. A great admirer of Hitler, he committed suicide by means of a cyanide capsule while in American captivity. Scherff was responsible for the destruction of parts of the complete stenographic record of Hitler's military conferences despite not having the authority to do so. Those copies under the administration of the Stenographic Service were ordered burned early in May 1945, at his direction.

Early gymnastics career Hădărean began gymnastics at the age of five, after a local coach spotted her talent and potential while she was playing in the park. At 13, she was selected to the Junior National team and moved to Onesti to train. During her junior career she won the all around title at the Junior European Championships in 1991, the gold medal on uneven bars and placed sixth on beam and tied for the fourth place on floor. Senior gymnastics career As a senior gymnast Hădărean was a consistent member of the Romanian team, helping the team to win the bronze medal at the 1991 World Championships and the silver medal at the 1992 Olympic Games. Individually she won the bronze medal in the all around event at the 1992 European championships. At the same competition she placed sixth on uneven bars and seventh on floor.Gymn Forum Results 1992 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships Events Finals During her senior career she was often overshadowed by many of the other strong Romanians of her time such as Lavinia Miloșovici, Cristina Bontaș, and Gina Gogean. As a result, she did not have as many opportunities to compete in individual events due to the 3-per-country rule. For example, at the 1992 Olympic Games Hădărean placed eleventh in the qualification for the all around event behind Bontaș, third, Miloșovici, fourth, and Gogean, seventh.Gymnastics Results 1992 Olympic Games; All around qualifications Coaching career Hădărean retired from competitive gymnastics in 1994. After graduating high school in Deva she moved on to a sports university. Shortly after enrolling in the university, she received a coaching position in Canada that she accepted. Hadarean quit school and moved to Canada where she coached at Mountain Star Gymnastics in Hamilton, Ontario and a second gym in Peterborough, Ontario. After more than two years coaching in Canada, she moved to the USA to coach in Houston, Texas at Moceanu Gymnastics Incorporated (MGI). When MGI closed, she moved to South Carolina to coach at Golden Strip Gymnastics (now renamed Champions Gymnastics). This position was short-lived however, and she returned to Romania. Back home, Hădărean began working for a private aerobics club, EOS Aerobic Centre, in Cluj-Napoca. At the age of 24, she returned to Canada in early November 2000, and began coaching at Mountain Star Gymnastics in Hamilton again. In mid-2001 she began a new coaching position at Tumblers Gymnastics Centre in Ottawa, Canada's capital. She served as the club's first provincial-level coach, focusing on choreography and strengthening the club's female elite program.

Threefish uses no S-boxes or other table lookups in order to avoid cache timing attacks; The paper in which Threefish was introduced. its nonlinearity comes from alternating additions with exclusive ORs. In that respect, it is similar to Salsa20, TEA, and the SHA-3 candidates CubeHash and BLAKE. Threefish and the Skein hash function were designed by Bruce Schneier, Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Doug Whiting, Mihir Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon Callas, and Jesse Walker. Description of the cipher Threefish works on words of 64 bits (unsigned Little endian integers). N_w \\\\in {4,8,16} is the number of plaintext words and also of key words. The tweak consists of two words. All additions and subtractions are defined modulo 2^{64}. = Key schedule = Threefish uses \\\\frac{N_r}{4} + 1 different round keys (N_r: Number of rounds). To calculate these keys an additional key word k_{N_w} is appended to the original key words k_0, k_1, \\\\dots, k_{N_w - 1}. An additional tweak word t_2 is also appended to the tweak words t_0, t_1. :k_{N_w} = C_{240} \\\\oplus k_0 \\\\oplus k_1 \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus k_{N_w - 1}; \\\\quad C_{240} = \\\\text{0x1BD11BDAA9FC1A22} :t_2 = t_0 \\\\oplus t_1 The purpose of the seemingly arbitrary constant C_{240} is to frustrate some attacks that take advantage of the relationship between k_{N_w} and the other keywords. The round key words k_{s, i} are now defined like this: k_{s, i} = \\\\begin{cases} k_{(s+i) \\\\bmod (N_w + 1)} & i = 0, \\\\dots, N_w - 4 \\\\ k_{(s+i) \\\\bmod (N_w + 1)} + t_{s \\\\bmod 3} & i = N_w - 3 \\\\ k_{(s+i) \\\\bmod (N_w + 1)} + t_{(s + 1) \\\\bmod 3} & i = N_w - 2 \\\\ k_{(s+i) \\\\bmod (N_w + 1)} + s & i = N_w - 1 \\\\end{cases} Here s = 0, 1, \\\\dots , N_r/4, and 4s is the number of the round in which the round key is used. =Mix function= Threefish Mix Function The mix function takes a tuple of words (x_0, x_1) and returns another tuple of words (y_0, y_1). The function is defined like this: y_0 = x_0 + x_1 \\\\mod 2^{64} y_1 = (x_1 \\\\lll R_{(d \\\\bmod 8), j}) \\\\oplus y_0 R_{d, j} is a fixed set of rotation constants chosen to achieve quick diffusion. = Permute = The permutation step swaps the positions of the words according to a constant pattern. Bit-level permutation is not achieved in this step, but this is not necessary since the MIX functions provides bit-level permutations in the form of bitwise rotations. The Permute step and rotation constants in the MIX functions are chosen in such a way that the overall effect is complete diffusion of all the bits in a data block. Because this permutation is fixed and independent of the key, the time needed to compute it does not provide information about the key or plaintext. This is important because on most modern microprocessors performance optimisations can make the time taken to compute an array operation dependent on where the data is stored in memory. In ciphers where array lookup depends on either the key or plaintext (as is the case for the substitution step in AES), it can make the cipher vulnerable to timing attacks by examining the time required for encryption. The permutation is therefore deliberately designed to ensure that it should execute in the same fashion independent of the key being used or the data encrypted. = A full Threefish round = * if d\\\\;\\\\bmod\\\\;4 = 0 the round key k_{d/4,i} is added to word i * the mix function is applied to consecutive words, the rotation widths depend on d and the word number * the words are permutated using a permutation independent from the round number Threefish256 and Threefish512 apply this round 72 times (d=0,1, \\\\dots,71). Threefish1024 applies it 80 times (d=0,1, \\\\dots,79). = Final operations = After all rounds are applied, the last round key is added to the words and the words are converted back to a string of bytes. Security In October 2010, an attack that combines rotational cryptanalysis with the rebound attack was published. The attack mounts a known-key distinguisher against 53 of 72 rounds in Threefish-256, and 57 of 72 rounds in Threefish-512. It also affects the Skein hash function. This is a follow-up to the earlier attack published in February, which breaks 39 and 42 rounds respectively. In response to this attack, the Skein team tweaked the rotation constants used in Threefish and thereby the key schedule constants for round 3 of the NIST hash function competition. In 2009, a related key boomerang attack against a reduced round Threefish version was published. For the 32-round version, the time complexity is 2^{226} and the memory complexity is 2^{12}; for the 33-round version, the time complexity is 2^{352.17} with a negligible memory usage. The attacks also work against the tweaked version of Threefish: for the 32-round version, the time complexity is 2^{222} and the memory complexity is 2^{12}; for the 33-round version, the time complexity is 2^{355.5} with a negligible memory usage.

Jorkens The Jorkens stories are \\"told\\" in the setting of a London gentleman's or adventurers' club of which the title character and the narrator are members, and usually open with another member mentioning an interesting experience he has had; this rouses Jorkens, who in return for a whisky-and-soda goes the other member one better with an extraordinary tall tale, supposedly from his own past. His stories often tip well over the boundaries of the plausible, into the realms of fantasy, horror, or even science fiction, and his auditors can never be quite sure what proportion of what he relates was truly experienced and to what degree he might have embellished. Contents The first volume comprises The Travel Tales of Mr. Joseph Jorkens, first published in London by G. P. Putnam's Sons in April, 1931 (and then in the USA), and Jorkens Remembers Africa, first published in New York City by Longmans, Green & Co. in 1934 (and then in the UK). The second volume gathers the third and fourth books of Dunsany's Jorkens tales, with two previously uncollected pieces. The books, Jorkens Has a Large Whiskey and The Fourth Book of Jorkens, were originally published in 1940 and 1947 respectively (the latter's 1948 USA edition from Arkham House was for many years the only Jorkens volume widely available). The third volume gathers the fifth and sixth books of Dunsany's Jorkens tales, with three previously uncollected pieces, including the last Jorkens story written. The books, Jorkens Borrows Another Whiskey and The Last Book of Jorkens were originally published in 1954 and 2002 respectively (the latter, prepared for publication around 1957, and only discovered in 2001, was published in a limited edition, with an introduction explaining its origins - not reproduced in the omnibus volume). The fifth book brought one key story in which Jorkens is joined by his most frequent adversary, Terbut, while the sixth book contains two stories written as late as 1957 (February and August); the author died in October 1957. The first volume was issued in a leatherette-bound hardback, with a stamped illustration (from Sidney Sime) and no dust jacket, in early 2004. It had originally been scheduled for release in 2003 with a dust jacket illustrated by Charles Vess but the publisher announced initially delays, and then a change to the format, due to the artist's heavy schedule. The second volume was also published in 2004, while the third was published in 2005. =Volume One= * Brief Foreword to the Complete Edition of Jorkens by the 20th Baron of Dunsany (in Table of Contents as Preface) * Dunsany, Lord of Fantasy by Arthur C.

Blue and Gray Transit Company Hill incorporated the Blue and Gray (called also B&G;) Transit Company in Charleston, West Virginia in May 1927 - to buy his own Midland Trail firm and at least three other highway carriers (thus increasing his route network) - to make it easy and simple to consolidate all the permits and certificates of all the predecessor firms. B&G; continued to expand, through Portsmouth to Cincinnati and to Columbus (all three in Ohio), through Wheeling (in West Virginia) to Pittsburgh (in Pennsylvania), to Lexington (in Virginia), and to Clarksburg and to Bluefield (both in West Virginia). Camel City Coach Company Meanwhile, in December 1925 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the Camel City Coach Company (bearing a nickname of its hometown due to the Camel cigarettes made there) came into existence, under the leadership of a merchant by the name of John Gilmer - to run between Charlotte (in North Carolina) and Martinsville (in Virginia) via Winston-Salem - and to expand. Soon Camel City grew, mostly by acquisition, first to the northwest to Mount Airy (in North Carolina), then to the south through Columbia and thence to the southeast to Charleston (both in South Carolina), onward through Savannah (in Georgia) to Jacksonville (in Florida), through Augusta and Waycross (both in Georgia) to Jacksonville (along a route from Augusta to Jacksonville acquired in March 1931 from the Greyhound Lines of Georgia, a predecessor of the Southeastern GL), to the west through Boone (in North Carolina) and thence to the northwest to Abingdon (in Virginia), to the north to Roanoke (in Virginia), and to the east-northeast through Greensboro (in North Carolina) and Danville to Norfolk and to Richmond (all three in Virginia). National Highway Transport Company Hill and Gilmer together organized the National Highway Transport (NHT) Company in December 1929 in Charleston, West Virginia, to buy the capital stock of the Blue and Gray and the Camel City concerns. Atlantic GL Early in 1931 the NHT firm (which already had formed operating ties to Greyhound and had begun negotiations with Greyhound) began using the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Atlantic Greyhound Lines (while at first retaining its own previous corporate name), then in July 1931 NHT became renamed as the Atlantic Greyhound Lines (with the consent of the parent Greyhound firm), although Greyhound had then acquired only a minority interest in NHT and not yet a controlling interest. By September 1931 the Skyland Stages, running since 1930 between Columbia (in South Carolina) and Knoxville (in Tennessee) via Greenville (in South Carolina) and Asheville (in North Carolina), became a division of the Atlantic GL. [John Gilmer (of the Camel City Coach Company) had begun the process of forming the Skyland Stages (which ran through the town of Skyland in North Carolina, between Asheville and Greenville), when in May 1929 he founded the Asheville-Knoxville Coach Company.] Old Dominion Stages Further, in 1929 three major players in the developing highway-coach industry - Arthur Hill (of the Blue and Gray Transit Company), John Gilmer (of the Camel City Coach Company), and Guy Huguelet (of the Consolidated Coach Corporation, based in Lexington, Kentucky, which in -36 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) - organized yet another carrier, based in Roanoke, named as the Old Dominion (called also OD) Stages, using the nickname of the state or Commonwealth of Virginia - to run between Knoxville and Washington, DC, via Bristol, Wytheville, Roanoke, Lexington, Staunton, and Winchester, Virginia, along a route which divided between the territories of the B&G; and the Camel City companies - with those three men owning the new firm in three equal shares. Service began on the day before Thanksgiving Day in November 1929. Tennessee Coach Company In May 1932 the OD Stages leased its rights to the route segment between Knoxville and Bristol (along US-11W) to the Tennessee Coach Company (called also TCC), which then was an independent regional carrier based in Knoxville, and which already ran (in part) between those two cities on its own parallel route (along -11E). Later in 1932 Hill and Gilmer bought the one-third interest of Huguelet in the OD Stages, then they merged OD into their Atlantic GL. The Tennessee Coach Company continued to run that leased segment (between Knoxville and Bristol) - and on that route took part in through-schedules (interlined pool operations) - that is, the use of through-coaches on through-routes running through the territories of two or more operating companies - in cooperation with the Atlantic GL, the Dixie GL, and the Southeastern GL - including through- schedules between Birmingham (in Alabama) and Bristol and between Memphis and Washington - until 1956, when the TCC joined the Trailways trade association (then named as the National Trailways Bus System), and when the TCC returned its leased right to that segment to the Atlantic GL (as the successor in interest of the OD Stages) - as a part of the deal related to the dissociation of the TCC from Greyhound. Afterward the TCC continued running between Knoxville and Bristol, but only along its own original route (on US-11E). John Gilmer and others John Gilmer, the founder of the Camel City Coach Company, participated also in a number of other activities during the early development of the highway-coach industry. In 1928 Gilmer provided much of the funds used in a refinancing and reorganizing of the Eastern Carolina Coach Company (running between Charlotte and Wilmington, both in North Carolina), which became renamed as the Queen City Coach Company (based in Charlotte), which (sometime about 1939-43) joined the National Trailways association (thus becoming called also the Queen City Trailways), and which in 1966 became bought by the Transcontinental Bus System (using the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Continental Trailways). [However, Gilmer ended his involvement with the Queen City firm in 1933.] In 1933 Gilmer (along with several other principals of the Queen City Coach Company) joined in forming the Old South Lines, which started running between Charlotte and Atlanta (in Georgia) and between Columbia (in South Carolina) and Atlanta. Gilmer's Old South Lines in 1934 bought the route between Atlanta and Montgomery (in Alabama) - including an alternate loop through Columbus (in Georgia) - from the Hood Coach Lines, which on that route had begun its first service (from Atlanta to Columbus in 1930, then onward to Montgomery in 1933), and which had soon tried (unsuccessfully) to run additional routes in the Peach State - between Atlanta and Macon, between Macon and Savannah, and between Macon and Jacksonville via Waycross. Hood in November 1934 sold also its other routes - to the Consolidated Coach Corporation and the Union Bus Company, acting jointly, with the Atlanta-Macon and Macon-Waycross-Jacksonville routes going to Consolidated (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) and with the Macon-Savannah route going to Union (which in 1941 became bought by and merged into the Southeastern GL) - thus providing Consolidated and Union (and therefore later Greyhound) not only a new route between Macon and Savannah and a parallel alternate route between Atlanta and Macon but also a quicker alternate route between Macon and Jacksonville (about 50 miles shorter than the older route via Valdosta in Georgia and Lake City in Florida). After that last sale the Hood firm, holding no other route, went out of business. In 1935 the Atlantic GL bought the Old South routes to Atlanta from Charlotte and from Columbia, thus preparing to establish connections in Atlanta with the Teche GL and the Southeastern GL. In February 1936 the Teche GL bought the Old South route between Atlanta and Montgomery (with the loop through Columbus), thus completing its route between New Orleans (in Louisiana) and Atlanta. Gilmer also owned one or more automotive dealerships in Winston-Salem which sold Chrysler cars and GMC trucks. Capitol GL The Capitol GL, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, came into existence in November 1930 - as a joint venture (owned in two equal shares) by the Blue and Gray Transit Company and The Greyhound Corporation (with an uppercase T, because the word \\"the\\" was an integral part of the legal name of the corporate entity) - to operate a single new main line, between Washington, DC, and Saint Louis (in Missouri), via Winchester (in Virginia), Clarksburg and Parkersburg (both in West Virginia), Chillicothe and Cincinnati (both in Ohio), Bedford and Vincennes (both in Indiana), and Olney and Salem (both in Illinois), along US-50 - a route shorter and quicker (six hours faster) than the best (then available) alternate route [via Hagerstown (in Maryland), Pittsburgh (in Pennsylvania), Wheeling (in West Virginia), Columbus (in Ohio), Indianapolis and Terre Haute (both in Indiana), and Effingham (in Illinois)] - plus a branch line between Shoals and Louisville (in Kentucky) via Paoli (in Indiana). As described above, B&G; (along with Camel City) in 1929 became a part of the NHT Company, which in 1931 became renamed as the Atlantic Greyhound Lines. The first president of the Capitol GL was Arthur Hill, the founder and president of the B&G; firm. In 1954 the parent Greyhound firm bought the 50-percent share of the Atlantic GL (which part had come from B&G;) in the Capitol GL, then Greyhound merged Capitol into the Pennsylvania GL, which in 1955 was merged with the old (second) Central GL, thereby forming the Eastern Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the new (second) Eastern GL), the first of four huge new divisions (along with Southern, Western, and Central, which last name became used again (in the fifth of six instances) but with a meaning quite different from its other applications). Atlantic GL as a division of The Greyhound Corporation The preserved Atlantic Greyhound Bus Terminal, Savannah, Georgia, (January 2017 photo) In 1936 The Greyhound Corporation accumulated a controlling (majority) interest in the Atlantic GL, and in 1957 the parent firm finished buying the remaining minority interest in the AGL and then merged the AGL into itself as a division of itself. By 1960 the Atlantic GL reached as far to the north as Columbus and Pittsburgh, as far to the east as the Atlantic Ocean, as far to the south as Jacksonville, and as far to the west as Cincinnati, Knoxville, and Atlanta. The AGL also ran extensive local commuter service based in its hometown of Charleston and in Portsmouth (in Ohio), Winston-Salem (in North Carolina), Sumter (in South Carolina), and (in conjunction with the Queen City Trailways) in Charlotte (in North Carolina). The Atlantic GL then met the new Eastern GL to the north, the new Central GL to the northwest, and the Southeastern GL to the west and the south; AGL also met the Richmond GL in Washington, DC, and in Norfolk and Richmond. AGL took part in a large number of major interlined north-south through-routes (using pooled equipment in cooperation with other Greyhound companies) - that is, the use of through-coaches on through-routes running through the territories of two or more Greyhound regional operating companies - between various pairs of cities (first between New York City and Jacksonville), including: in the north, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston, New York City, and Washington, and in the south, Norfolk, Memphis, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, Saint Petersburg, and New Orleans. Merger with Southeastern GL In November 1960, in another round of consolidation, Greyhound merged the Atlantic GL with - not into but rather with - the Southeastern GL, based in Lexington, Kentucky, a neighboring regional company - thereby forming the Southern Division of The Greyhound Corporation, called also the Southern GL, the third of four huge new divisions (along with Central, Eastern, and Western) - which reached as far to the north as Springfield and Effingham (both in Illinois), Columbus, Pittsburgh, and Washington, as far to the east as the Atlantic Ocean, as far to the south as Miami and Key West, and as far to the west as Cincinnati, Saint Louis, Memphis, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lake Charles (in Louisiana and on the way to Houston, the rest of Texas, and the rest of the West) - from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Ohio River to the Gulf of Mexico.. Thus ended the Atlantic GL and the Southeastern GL, and thus began the Southern GL. Beyond Atlantic GL Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thus leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. When the Southern GL came into existence, the headquarters functions became gradually transferred from Lexington, Kentucky, and Charleston, West Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia; when GLE arose, many of those administrative functions became shifted from Atlanta to Cleveland, Ohio; eventually those functions migrated to Chicago, Illinois, then to Phoenix, Arizona - when (in 1971) The Greyhound Corporation moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to a new building in Phoenix. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original Greyhound umbrella firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business), to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas - a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the National Trailways trade association. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey (as the chief executive officer) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives - while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through- coaches, thereby requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Λ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound (that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation).

The airfield was protected by No. 2828 Squadron RAF Regiment =Postwar= The airfield was also temporarily home to No. 21 Operational Training Unit flying Wellingtons from RAF Enstone from August 1945 for two months because the runways at their home base were being repaired. From October 1945 until 1946 107 Sub Storage Unit from No. 8 Maintenance Unit used the airfield for storing Wellingtons and General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. The role of the airfield after the war changed with the reduction of flying movements and with a slight change in what the units did on the airfield when No. 107 Sub Storage Unit from 1947 began to collect no longer needed Wellingtons which were then scrapped and taken to Weston Subedge goods yard (which was near to the south-western corner) where the railway would take them to the necessary destination. =Accidents and incidents= 7 August 1940 Handley Page Hampden P2086 of 4 Ferry Pilots Pool stalled attempting to force land after an engine failure. 24 December 1941 Bristol Blenheim L8663 of Ferry Training Unit stalled on approach. 10 March 1942 Lockheed Hudson V8995 of the Ferry Training Unit spun into ground. 20 July 1943 Avro Anson DJ242 of 24 OTU undershot landing. 14 May 1944 Armstrong Whitworth Whitley N1436 of 24 OTU stalled on overshoot. 6 January 1945 Vickers Wellington HE633 of 24 OTU crashed on take off when an engine failed. 28 April 1947 Wellington JA349 was hit by Wellington LR130 while parked. Current use In July 1948 the site was closed and much has reverted to farmland with runways being removed in 1968. During 1949 and into 1950 parts of the site were used for temporary housing for local families while new Council housing developments were being built in the area - people moving into the new houses when completed.

The Wu-Tang Clan sampled dialogue from the film for the song \\"Let My Niggas Live\\" and \\"Gravel Pit\\" in 2000. Plot Short Eyes is set in an unnamed prison in New York City, whose inmates are predominantly black or Puerto Rican. One day, Clark Davis, a young, middle-class white man accused of raping a young girl, arrives on remand. His fellow prisoners immediately turn on him—child rapists are considered the lowest form of prison life—except for Juan, one of the institution's older prisoners, who treats him with dignity. Davis insists he doesn't remember raping the girl, but he admits to Juan that he has molested several other children. The prosecution's case against Davis is weak and, unless Juan tells prison authorities about Davis' confessions to him, it is only a matter of time before he is set free. As Juan struggles with what to do, the other prisoners plan to get rid of Davis permanently. Cast Music Curtis Mayfield wrote the film's score, and appears in the film as a prisoner performing the song \\"Do Do Wap Is Strong In Here\\".

Extwistle Hall Extwistle Hall stands high on Extwistle Moor between Haggate (east of Brierfield) and the village of Worsthorne. The Hall, built of coursed sandstone on three sides of a courtyard, is now a ruin. It was built in the 16th century in the Tudor style by the Parker family who were prominent in local affairs. Robert Parker had bought the land, which had previously belonged to Kirkstall Abbey, in 1537 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Parker family occupied it for some two hundred years before moving to Cuerden Hall around 1718. John Parker was High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1653 and Robert Parker for 1710.

He rose to fame during the 2000s when his daily Nob Nation slots aired on RTÉ Radio. His Callan's Kicks creation on RTÉ Radio 1 has been described by The Sunday Independent as \\"the best comedy show the national broadcaster has ever produced\\". Nob Nation and Callan's Kicks parody political, social and cultural personalities, with Callan performing as the characters featured on the show. His radio broadcasts have led to the release of regular podcasts, several CDs and appearances on prime time television programmes such as The Saturday Night Show on RTÉ One. He has also incurred the wrath of several politicians and the Kerry GAA star Paul Galvin for his impressions. He is well known in Ireland and the UK for skewering celebrities and politicians on radio. His acerbic wit and talent for mimicry has made him a household name, according to the Irish Independent. Early life Callan is from Inniskeen in County Monaghan. He grew up on a farm and has a degree in journalism from Dublin City University. Callan initially worked as a newsreader on Today FM where he performed on Gift Grub as Enda Kenny, he later began to perform sketches on The Gerry Ryan Show on RTÉ 2fm . He wrote and produced almost 900 Nob Nation sketches on his own for the Gerry Ryan Show over three years. Nob Nation Nob Nation was Callan's first foray into comedy and was a sketch insert on The Gerry Ryan Show from 2007 until the presenter's death in 2010. Nob Nation even produced a comedy sketch just days after Gerry Ryan's death in tribute to the broadcaster. Nob Nation was reported in the Sunday Independent on 20 January 2008 as being Ireland's most popular podcast of the previous year, with figures showing a total of 736,711 downloads on RTÉ.ie between April and December 2007. Comparatively, RTÉ Radio 1's most popular radio show, Morning Ireland, was second with 730,965 podcast downloads. Nob Nation was also frequently in the top five of the iTunes chart. His impersonations of Eamon Dunphy and David Norris led to a warning from the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BAI) in July 2008. The BAI deemed his impersonations \\"offensive to homosexuals\\" and said they \\"promoted binge drinking\\". Following some complaints about Callan's portrayal of Taoiseach Brian Cowen \\"swaying and snorting in booze-filled sing-songs about his difficulties in office\\", the popularity of the slot \\"simply exploded\\" according to RTÉ, with over 250,000 hits each month and making up almost a third of all downloads from RTÉ.ie. Callan's portrayal of Enda Kenny as cross-dresser \\"Dame Enda\\" has drawn reactions from Fine Gael and Enda Kenny himself. The first Nob Nation CD, containing twenty of Callan's sketches,\\"NOB NATION - As heard on RTÉ Radio's Gerry Ryan Show\\" . CD World.ie. Retrieved 31 October 2008. was released in Ireland in November 2007 and went platinum. Those parodied on the compilation include politicians Bertie Ahern and Enda Kenny, former Republic of Ireland national football team manager Steve Staunton, broadcaster Gay Byrne and newsreaders Bryan Dobson and Colm Murray. The album debuted at number five on the Irish Albums Chart ahead of Amy Winehouse and Bruce Springsteen on 9 November 2007, according to IRMA, the official chart tracking body in Ireland.\\"Irish Charts Week 45 - 2007 Top 50 Albums\\".

In August 2010, a new website www.nobnation.com showcasing comedy videos and purportedly uncensored versions of Nob Nation podcasts appeared. A number of Sunday newspapers reported that the website featured controversial depictions of Brian Cowen in a bar along with Judge Gargle, a fictional character loosely based on a high-profile Irish judge. Callan once rang Charlie Bird and, impersonating Enda Kenny, said there was a story about to break about Kenny buying women's underwear. Bird thought it was real. Callan's Kicks/The Saturday Night Show Callan now works on Callan's Kicks, a sketch show on RTÉ Radio One and on RTÉ One television. The radio version of the show has led to controversy over his portrayal of Ireland's President Michael D. Higgins and his aide Kevin McCarthy which led to RTÉ producers ordering Callan to tone down on. The Callan's Kicks TV spin-off debuted on New Year's Eve 2013. Callan Kicks the Year proved a hit with viewers on RTÉ One television, and its ratings beat Christmas specials by rivals The Mario Rosenstock Show and Irish Pictorial Weekly. The show once again proved controversial in its portrayal of the President and his aide leading the Sunday World to publish a front-page story on the programme before it aired. Callan's Kicks debut TV series followed in July 2014 and it too proved to be a ratings success with over 400,000 viewers tuning in each Friday night, beating Eastenders, Prime Time, Fair City and Saturday Night with Miriam. A second Christmas special on RTÉ One Television followed in December 2014. Callan Kicks the Year featured Dobbo and other characters parodying events of the year like the Irish Water, Rehab and Cronyism scandals; President Michael D. Higgins' state visit to the United Kingdom and also debuted new characters, Bono and the Gleesons. In October 2011, Callan was allegedly assaulted by Kerry GAA star Paul Galvin late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a \\"fucking cunt\\". The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána. The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on radio.' and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to \\"gay jibes\\" the satirist had directed at him. It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all) to RTÉ after what he described as \\"the most excruciating night of my life\\" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's \\"years spent in the closet\\". Callan impersonated Galvin again on radio the week after the alleged assault. Callan then appeared on The Saturday Night Show for an unprecedented second consecutive week to defend himself against accusations of homophobia by coming out on live television. Live Callan performed five sell-out nights live at Dublin's Olympia Theatre between September 2008 and May 2013. Paul Galvin featured in that live show along with over fifty other characters.

It is assigned to the 53d Test and Evaluation Group, stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The squadron performs operational testing of all fighter aircraft and munitions entering and in operational use by Air Combat Command. The unit was originally formed as the 422d Night Fighter Squadron in 1943. After training in the United States, it was deployed to Ninth Air Force in England in the spring of 1944, prior to the D-Day landings in France. During the run-up to D-Day, the squadron trained with Royal Air Force night fighter units against Luftwaffe raiders who intruded the night skies over England. It was the first American squadron in England equipped with the Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter. After the landings in France, the mission of the squadron became the air defense of Allied liberated territory. During the Battle of the Bulge, it also flew day and night interdiction missions against enemy troop movements, bridges and other targets of opportunity. It was inactivated shortly after the war in Europe ended. In 1969, the squadron was reactivated at Nellis Air Force Base by Tactical Air Command to provide combat evaluation and operational testing of new USAF aircraft entering the inventory after developmental testing was completed at Edwards Air Force Base. Overview The 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron is a geographically separated unit of the 53d Test and Evaluation Group, home stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

This task is essential, as the lives of pilots and other aircrew will depend upon the performance of any new system during actual combat operations. The 422d TES is a composite squadron that currently includes the A-10 Thunderbolt II, McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle, McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Testing and evaluation includes the aircraft hardware, engines, software, and weapons upgrades prior to release of the aircraft or modification to operational Air Combat Command operational units. In addition to its operational testing mission, the 422d TES is also responsible for the development and testing of new tactics for the USAF. The squadron develops new tactics to employ weapons systems in combat as part of its operational testing role. Additionally, the unit also works on developing new tactics to counter emerging threat weapons systems as intelligence becomes available. When developing new tactics, the 422nd TES works closely with the USAF Weapons School. However, ultimately, the 422d TES is responsible for the development and testing of all new tactics for every CAF fighter Mission Design Series. The squadron supports other mission areas, to include foreign materiel exploitation and field visits to instruct operational aircrews on new systems and tactics. =Current Divisions= * A-10 Division : Established 1977.

They also developed and evaluated night vision goggle tactics for the F-15C Eagle, a first for this aircraft in the active Air Force. * F-15E Division : Established 1989. Developed new methods of employing the LANTIRN system in a counter-offensive air-to-air role. The F-15E division aircrews also became the first in the Air Force to employ Night Vision Goggles, as they developed and evaluated new tactics in night combat search and rescue. * F-16 Division : Established 1980 as F-16A Division, F-16C in 1985. Evaluated Night Vision Goggle employment in several missions, including night combat search and rescue, along with various NVG compatible cockpit configurations.

The 422d was the first of the third group of dedicated night fighter squadrons trained by the Army Air Forces It initially trained with the Douglas P-70 Havoc night fighter at Orlando, although later that fall the squadron began to train with service test models of the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. In January, training was interrupted when the night fighter school was moved from Florida to Hammer Field, California. After the relocation, the squadron completed its training in March 1944Pape, Campbell & Campbell, The 422d was the first night fighter squadron to be assigned to Ninth Air Force in England. RAF Charmy Down eventually would become the home of three night fighter squadrons (422d, 423d, and 424th Night Fighter Squadron), however the squadron arrived un-equipped as the P-61 Black Widows were late in arriving. Subsequently, the squadron had its aircrews posted to various Royal Air Force night fighter and signal schools for theater indoctrination. Meanwhile, as there was no sign of the P-61s. the pilots kept up their flight time on Cessna UC-78 Bobcats and de Havilland Mosquitoes. Tennessee Ridge Runner P-61 42-25543 at an ALG in France or the Low Countries, Fall 1944 The squadron moved to RAF Scorton on 6 May. The original plan had been for all three night fighter squadrons to be on combat status with P-61s by D-Day, however the first P-61 didn't arrive until the end of May, about two weeks before the planned invasion of France. With the arrival of the German V-1 flying bombs over England after the invasion, the squadron trained with their Black Widows by intercepting the flying bombs. The first Black Widow V-1 \\"kill\\" took place on 16 July 1944, credited to pilot Herman Ernst and radar operator Edward Kopsel of the 422nd Night Fighter Squadron. One of the greatest dangers involved in killing V-1s was the possibility of getting too close to the flying bomb when one fired at it, running the risk of damage to their own plane if the bomb exploded when hit. Finally, on 25 July, a month and a half after D-Day, the squadron was considered to be operationally ready for night interception and moved up to Maupertu Airfield (A-15) in France. From Maupertu the squadron entered combat and began to perform night interception of intruding Luftwaffe bombers and night fighters. As the number of enemy night intruders was small, the squadron also performed offensive interdictionary attacks on Axis forces in France and the Low Countries 1944, moving eastward through a series of Advanced Landing Grounds until operating from captured Luftwaffe bases in Germany during the spring of 1945. The squadron ended combat operations in May 1945 and became part of the Army of Occupation until August 1945. Demobilized in Europe, aircraft flown back to the United States for storage or use with postwar All Weather Air Defense Command interceptor squadrons. =Weapons testing= The unit was reactivated in 1969 as the 422d Fighter Weapons Squadron when it replaced the 4539th Fighter Weapons Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.History of the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron, compiled by the 96th Test Wing Public Affairs, Eglin Air Force Base, FL Squadron F-111E 68-0011 at Nellis in 1971 Its initial primary mission was the operational test and evaluation of General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark aircraft. Took over F-111As of 4539th Combat Crew Training Squadron, aircraft tail coded \\"WF\\". In 1977, F-111 testing ended at Nellis and was relocated to McClellan Air Force Base, California, as Detachment 3, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. McClellan was the Air Force Logistics Command prime support depot for the F-111 and changes and modifications could be made there and tested by the detachment. The 431st Test and Evaluation Squadron was activated at McClellan in 1980, replacing the detachment and remained active until June 1992 when the F-111D was retired. In 1971 the McDonnell F-4 Phantom II joined the squadron; LTV A-7D Corsair IIs were added in 1972, and were flown until 1975. A-10 and F-15 aircraft were added in 1977, as were F-16As in 1980. In 1982 the 422 Fighter Weapons Squadron's name changed to the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), to better reflect its role. In 1985, the F-4E was retired from the 422 TES. During this time, the F-16C began testing at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, as the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, Det 1. In October 1987, Det 1 was closed at Luke, and its aircraft were moved to Nellis. This gave the 422 TES an aircraft complement of A-10s, F-15s, F-16As, and F-16Cs. 1989 saw the rapid expansion of squadron capability with the addition of the F-15E and F-16C Low Altitude Navigation Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) aircraft. With these two systems, the 422 TES greatly expanded its ability to fly night tactical missions. F-4 Division F-4D Phantom II 66-8700 in 1975 1991 began with Operation Desert Storm. Although the 422 TES did not deploy for direct participation, it was involved in several quick look evaluations of equipment and employment tactics which directly enhanced the effectiveness of the air war. The efforts of the 422 TES over the past ten years to improve weapons, avionics, and tactics provided the ultimate reward: a quick and decisive victory. The 422 TES began 1993 with the return of a veteran aircraft to the lineup. The F-4G Wild Weasel officially became part of the testing program at Nellis on 1 February 1993. The Sikorsky HH-60 Blackhawk helicopter came aboard on 1 July 1995 as the newest member of the 422 TES team. Later that year the F-4 was retired again, as the last test F-4G was flown to the Aerospace Maintenance Regeneration Center in Arizona. On 1 October 1996, the 422 TES was realigned under the 53d Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as the United States Air Warfare Center assigned all testing to this wing. The squadron grew to its largest size since World War II when the squadron inherited all test management, advanced programs, and test support from the 57th Test Group. The mission of the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron continues to grow in scope and complexity as new aircraft and systems are developed for use in the combat air forces.

Recent phylogenetic analyses does not support the prior classifications of this family, and suggest that the family is not monophyletic as it is currently circumscribed. Morphology Members of the family are diverse in ascomatal or cleistothecial form. Individual taxa may be sessile (without a stipe) to shortly stipitate, cupulate (cup-shaped), discoid (disc-shaped), pulvinate (cushion-shaped), or with turbinate (turban-shaped) epigeous apothecia. Also, taxa may be sub-hypogeous to hypogeous with closed, folded, or solid ascomata. Apothecia may range in size from less than 1 mm up to 12 cm diam, and may be brightly colored due to carotenoid pigments.

Kuo Yao-chi was fascinated in music since childhood and had won the first place of Taoyuan County Junior Piano Competition. Kuo graduated from National Cheng Kung University's Department of Urban Planning; she went to England where she earned her master's degree in Urban Development and the New Town Development from the University of London. Kuo passed the National Higher Examination for Urban Planning and was one of the few excellent female executives from the grassroots in Taiwan. Kuo started her occupation as an assistant researcher at the Urban Design and Environmental Planning Lab in Tamkang University, a planner in the Taiwan Housing and Urban Development Bureau, senior planner in the Taipei Urban Planning Committee, section chief of the Public Works Bureau, and Information Team Leader. Kuo once handled a major urban planning project, saved more than 260 million NT dollar of public funds for the Taipei City Government and had been awarded an excellent performance by the Taipei City Government. Because of her devotion to work, she was appreciated by colleagues and the major. Kuo was promoted as a secretary general of the Public Works Bureau and after that the first female director general of the Public Housing Department in the Taipei City Government. Kuo had successfully solved sea sand houses, slanted houses, and radiation houses problems. She was reforming public housing rental management system, abolishing unfair manner priority waiting roster, and the first to create leasehold housing for low-income families. In year 2000, Kuo served as a director of Public Affairs of the Presidential Office, minister without portfolio, and chair of the Public Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan in 2002. Meanwhile, she also served as the CEO of the 921 Post-earthquake Disaster Recovery Commission to accelerate the reconstruction works. For Kuo's great achievement in recovering and revitalizing the 921 earthquake disaster areas, she was elected as the Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award of the National Cheng Kung University in 2004. In year 2006, Kuo served as a minister of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, Republic of China. One of her great achievement was to complete and officially open the 12.9 km Hsuehshan Tunnel (雪山隧道) -- Asia's longest and the world's fourth-longest.Shan, Shelley. \\"Tunnel opening draws eager crowds.\\" Taipei Times. June 17, 2006. However, she resigned her commission being responsible for the policy of electronic toll collection system (ETC). Kuo Yao-chi is a devout Buddhist, often participates in the religious and social welfare activities, such as continuing to care the Xiao-lin Village reconstruction, assist surviving families’ livelihoods, initiated \\"School Nest” volunteer activities, and involving herself as a volunteer teacher. She brings the community together to care for children of low-income families in Tataocheng (大稻埕) area. Currently she is also caring for elderly parents with dementia.. Controversy After Kuo leaving office, she was accused of receiving a bribe of US$20,000 by the prosecutors who monitoring chair of Nan Ren Hu Lee Ching-po (李清波) telling to his son Lee Tsung-hsien (李宗賢) to present two cans of tea to Kuo, and putting US$20,000 to help Kuo's son studying abroad on the phone call in 2006. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction handed down by the Taiwan High Court in March, which found Kuo guilty of accepting a bribe related to using her position as transportation minister to grant favors to the Nan Ren Hu Group, a service industry conglomerate, even though she had been found not guilty in first and second trials in 2009 and 2010 respectively. \\"I have never received bribes... A reputation is not earned in one or two days. I have spent my entire career as a public servant building a good reputation. All my associates know I am not someone who can be bribed,\\" Kuo told a press conference in Taipei. The former minister held a press conference insisting on her innocence. Kuo was accompanied by her lawyers Wellington Ku (顧立雄) and Li Yung-ran (李永然), as well as Taipei mayoral aspirant Dr. Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) and others. They all claimed the conviction was flawed because of insufficient evidence and inconsistent testimony from Lee Tsung-hsien, son of Nan Ren Hu chairman Lee Ching-po. They said they would sue Lee Tsung-hsien for perjury and request a retrial and an extraordinary appeal. Lee Tsung-hsien testified that he had been asked by his father to deliver the cash, but he gave inconsistent information about the numbers, color and material of the tea gift boxes that contained the US$20,000 and were allegedly delivered to Kuo, at first saying that the cash was placed in two iron tea boxes. He revoked his deposition after Kuo submitted a red tea box, which prosecutors failed to find in a raid of her house, and subsequently said that there was only one cardboard tea box. The Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau later canceled Lee Tsung-hsien's original testimony, Koo said. \\"In other words, Kuo’s conviction was upheld with inconsistent testimony and without any substantial evidence because no cash was never found — not in the tea box nor in any of Kuo’s or her family’s bank accounts,\\" Koo said. \\"I'm wondering if the judicial system applies a different set of standard for DPP politicians and government officials who served under the DPP administration.\\"Wang, Chris. \\"Kuo to fight conviction.\\" Taipei Times.

It began with the first meeting of the Council of State in Perak, where the British first started to assert their influence in the Malay states. Under the terms of the Pangkor Engagement of 1874 between the Sultan of Perak and the British, the Sultan was obliged to accept a British Resident. Hugh Low, the second British Resident, convinced the Sultan to set up advisory Council of State, the forerunner of the state legislative assembly. Similar Councils were constituted in the other Malay states as and when they came under British protection. Originally playing an advisory role, the function of the council was later extended to include both legislative and executive functions. This continued until 1948 when the Federation of Malaya was formed by two agreements, namely the State Agreement and the Federation of Malaya Agreement. The State Agreement was of great significance to Malaysia's constitutional development. By virtue of this agreement, the Malay Rulers with the advice and concurrence of the traditional chiefs and elders of the states promulgated their respective State Constitutions except for Johor and Terengganu where Constitutions had already been in place since 1895 and 1911 respectively. The Rulers were also required to distinguish the legislative power in their respective states from the executive power, by constituting a legislative body, called the Council of State and State Executive Council whose advice he was required to obtained. The Federation of Malaya Agreement that served as the core for the current federal system of central government was concluded as a compromise to the much-opposed Malayan Union. The Federation consisted of the Federated Malay States (FMS), the Unfederated Malay States and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Melaka. The FMS consisted of Perak, Selangor, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan while the non-FMS were Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Johor. The federal government comprised the High Commissioner, an Executive Council and Legislative Council. The agreement also provided for a Conference of Rulers with its own elected chairman. Each of the states had its own Executive Council and Council of States to deal with all matters not specifically reserved to the Federation. The Federal Government was responsible for defence, the police, and the railways, labour, broadcasting, post and finance. This 1948 Constitution remained in force with some essential amendments, until 1957 when the Federation of Malaya gained its independence. A constitutional conference was held in London from 18 January to 6 February 1956 when the British promised Independence and self-government to the Federation of Malaya. It was attended by a delegation from the Federation of Malaya, consisting of four representatives of the Malay Rulers, the Chief Minister of the Federation (Tunku Abdul Rahman) and three other ministers, and also by the British High Commissioner in Malaya and his advisers.See paragraph 3 of the Report by the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Conference The conference proposed the appointment of a commission to devise a constitution for a fully self-governing and independent Federation of Malaya.See paragraphs 74 and 75 of Report by the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Conference This proposal was accepted by Queen Elizabeth II and the Malay Rulers. Accordingly, pursuant to such agreement, the Reid Commission, consisting of constitutional experts from fellow Commonwealth countries and headed by Lord William Reid, a distinguished Lord-of-Appeal-in-Ordinary, was appointed to make recommendations for a suitable constitution. The report of the Commission was completed on 11 February 1957.See the Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission 1957 The report was then examined by a working party appointed by the British Government, the Conference of Rulers and the Government of the Federation of Malaya and the Federal Constitution was enacted on the basis of its recommendations.Wu Min Aun (2005).The Malaysian Legal System, 3rd Ed., pp. 47 and 48.: Pearson Malaysia Sdn Bhd. . The Constitution came into force on 27 August 1957 but formal independence was only achieved on 31 August however. The constitutional machinery devised to bring the new constitution into force consisted of: * In the United Kingdom, the Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957, together with the Orders in Council made under it. The Federation of Malaya Independence Act, 1957 passed by the British Parliament gave parliamentary approval to Her Britannic Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to terminate her sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of the Straits Settlements of Melaka and Penang and all powers and jurisdiction in respect of the Malay States or the Federation as a whole. * The Federation of Malaya Agreement 1957, made on 5 August 1957 between the British High Commissioner on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II and the Malay Rulers.

Personal life John Daly was born in South East London, a part of London which was badly bombed and damaged in World War II. He attended St Joseph's Roman Catholic school in Camberwell. Daly was father to Jenny, Michael, Julian, and Timothy. Career =Music= With David Hemmings, Daly formed Hemdale Film Corporation in 1967. Hemdale had many diverse entertainment business interests, and grew rapidly in the 1970s by managing bands such as Yes, Black Sabbath and many other well-known UK artists. The company also acquired the worldwide stage rights for Lionel Bart's musical Oliver!, along with producing Grease starring Richard Gere. =Film= Hemdale began producing, financing and distributing its own full-length feature films, becoming a leading independent film company in Britain with films such as Melody, Tommy, The Triple Echo and Images by Robert Altman. Hemdale gave career starts to actors such as Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington, and Julia Roberts. It also worked with directors including James Cameron (The Terminator); Oliver Stone (Salvador, Platoon); Mick Jackson (The Bodyguard); Martin Campbell (James Bond and The Legend of Zorro); Michael Apted (Coal Miner's Daughter); Robert Altman (Images); John Schlesinger (The Falcon and the Snowman), Ken Loach (Hidden Agenda); Harold Becker (The Boost); Gillian Armstrong (High Tide); Tim Hunter (River's Edge) and James Foley (At Close Range).

He turned to Daly, who together with Video Techniques Inc. (of which King was a director), were the official co-promoters. In 1994, Daly conceived the High Noon in Hong Kong boxing event, investing at least $800,000 of his own money, but it was cancelled at the last minute after Barry Hearn withdrew his boxers when no purses was forthcoming. \\"My end of the deal was kept,\\" Daly argued. \\"I had to arrange the stadium, air fares and all the pre-fight promotional expenses, which I did, but the purses were not part of my obligation.\\"Boxing: Everybody blames each other for fight fiasco: High Noon in Hong Kong promised much but delivered only grief, as Harry Mullan discovered The Independent, 24 October 1994 Business interests Daly's company Hemdale acquired an ownership interest in a TV company, its own film studios, and an off-track betting company chain of shops. From 2003, Daly acted as Chairman, CEO and President of Film and Music Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries. In May 2008, he took a leave of absence from his executive duties. He remained chairman until his death. Death John Daly, 71, died on 31 October 2008 of cancer. He was survived by his daughter, Jenny, and three sons, Michael, Julian and Timothy. Awards On behalf of his companies, Daly achieved 21 Oscar nominations and 13 wins, including consecutive Best Picture wins for Platoon and The Last Emperor (as executive producer, shared with the film's producer Jeremy Thomas), an unequaled achievement in independent filmmaking.

They use their byssus to completely immobilize themselves to the roots of mangrove trees, corals, and other substrates.

It is also known as the Tilghman-Woolfolk House and the Lloyd Tilghman House and Civil War Museum. Early years The Greek Revival house was built in 1852 by Robert Woolfolk on the behalf of Lloyd Tilghman, who had just moved with his family to Paducah that year. Tilghman was a West Point graduate, having finished 46th out of 49 in his class, but spent less than a year as a Second Lieutenant. He moved to Paducah, then a community of 3,000 people, due to being assigned there by his employer, the New Orleans and Ohio Railroad, as a railroad civil engineer for the first railroad to connect Paducah to major cities to the south. Tilghman did not purchase the house; Woolfolk remained the owner of the property. Tilghman and his wife, seven children, and five slaves called the residence home until 1861, although Tilghman spent much of his time working on a railroad in the Isthmus of Panama. At the time of his departure from the home, he was one of two colonels of the Kentucky State Guard whose stated purpose was to defend the state's neutrality. He officially left Paducah in June 1861, delaying his departure to prevent more pro-Union officers from leading the state militia in Paducah.Jacobsen pp.7.1, 8.6–8Raab p.22 Woolfolk's family then moved into the home. When Federal troops finally arrived in Paducah, their headquarters were directly across from the Woolfolk home. Woolfolk was pro-Southern and flew a Confederate flag in response, sparking a riot in December 1861 that included Union soldiers, particularly those of the 11th Indiana Regiment. The incident would begin Brigadier General Charles Ferguson Smith's decline as he saw his subordinate, Ulysses S. Grant, raised above him almost immediately.Jacobsen p.8.10 Woolfolk was banished from Paducah and the United States to Canada on August 1, 1864 by Union Brigadier General Eleazer A. Paine. Two weeks later his wife and family were also banished to Canada, which resulted in eight of Woolfolk's household, four others from Paducah, and eleven from Columbus, Kentucky following Woolfolk into exile.

Lamon V. Harkness became involved with Standard Oil through his father Stephen V. Harkness who was a primary silent investor in the formation of Standard Oil. Early life Harkness was born in Bellevue, Ohio on January 6, 1850. He was the son of Stephen Vanderburgh Harkness (1818–1888) and his first wife, Laura (née Osborne) Harkness (1815–1852). Lamons mother Laura died in 1852 when Lamon was just 2 years old. His father Stephen was remarried to Anna M. Harkness (née Richardson) in 1854. The Harknesses moved to Monroeville, OH around 1860 and in 1865, they moved from Monroeville to Willoughby, Ohio outside of Cleveland. Stephen and Anna had two children, Charles W. Harkness born 1860 in Monroeville and Edward Harkness born 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. The age difference between Lamon and Charles was 10 years and between Lamon and Edward was 24 years. Career At the age of 16, Lamon bought a ranch outside of Eureka, Kansas. He entered the cattle business at the age of 19. About this same time, Lamon's father made an investment with JD Rockefeller to start Standard Oil. This investment would soon change the lives of the whole Harkness family. After Standard Oil started on its way, Lamon move to Kansas City, Missouri where he dabbled in the banking business. Standard Oil continued on to become a behemoth and a huge success. However, in 1888,(Stephen was 70 and Lamon was 38) Lamon's father Stephen died. After his father's passing, Lamon decided to come back east and settled in Greenwich, Connecticut where he bought the William Avery Rockefeller mansion in 1891. The mansion was situated on 34 acres and had 22 bedrooms. =Horse breeding= Following a trip to Kentucky in 1892, Lamon acquired a farm in Donerail, Kentucky named Walnut Hall Farm. There, he developed a Standardbred horse breeding operation of major importance to the harness racing industry. In 1904, Walnut Hall had expanded to 2,000 acres and 100 mares.Kentucky Horse Park The farm became one of the best-known Standardbred farms in the world. The farm's Big Barn built by Harkness in 1897 is 476 feet long, and has 52 stalls, a sales area and auctioneer's block – and it's still in service 113 years later at the Kentucky Horse Park. When Harkness died in 1915, the then-5,000-acre farm with 1400 horses was passed to his heirs. Although sub- divided several times, a part of which is now home to the Kentucky Horse Park, Walnut Farm remains in the hands of his descendants.Walnut Stock Farm history In recognition of his contribution to the industry, in 1958 Lamon Harkness was inducted posthumously in the Harkness Racing Museum and Hall of Fame.Walnut Hall Farm and Walnut Hall Stud at Thoroughbred Heritage =Yachting= Harkness was well known as a yachtsman who owned the SS Wakiva which became part of the United States Navy during 1917 and 1918 and had war service during World War I.

Background  Guan Bo was born in 719, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Wei Prefecture (衛州, in modern Puyang, Henan) and claimed ancestry from the late Han Dynasty general Guan Yu.Old Book of Tang, vol. 130 .New Book of Tang, vol. 75 . Late in Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), Guan Bo passed the imperial examinations. During the subsequent reign of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, when the general Deng Jingshan () served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Deng invited Guan to serve as a secretary under him. Guan subsequently returned to the capital Chang'an to serve in the imperial guard corps, and then as You Bujue (), a low-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). He was said to be well-versed in philosophy and metaphysics, particularly Buddhist philosophy.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  During the Dali era (767-779) of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Guan Bo had a close association with the imperial guard commander Wang Jiahe () and Wang's wife, who was also named Guan. The chancellor Yuan Zai was displeased about this association, and he sent Guan Bo away from the capital, to serve as an officer at Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the region of the eastern capital Luoyang). While at Henan, Guan acted as magistrate of several counties and was said to be capable in his governance. When Chen Shaoyou () later served as the governor of Zhedong Circuit (浙東, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) and then Huainan Circuit, he invited Guan to serve as his secretary. He later acted as the prefect of Chu Prefecture (滁州, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui). When Li Lingyao () rebelled against imperial authority in 776 and seized nearby Biansong Circuit (汴宋, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Chen was one of the generals commissioned against Li Lingyao, but as he commanded the troops against Biansong, the bandits in his own circuit were rampaging. Guan mobilized the prefectural militia to defend against the bandits, and also was said to be a simple but effective governor. After Yang Guan and Chang Gun became chancellors in 777 to replace Yuan, they recommended Guan to be Duguan Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu).  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Early in Emperor Dezong's reign, there was a group of bandits who occupied caves in Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), led by Wang Guoliang (). Emperor Dezong sent Guan to try to persuade Wang to submit. Before Guan's departure, Emperor Dezong and he had a conversation in which Guan impressed Emperor Dezong with words about finding capable officials. Upon Guan's return from the mission, Emperor Dezong made him Bingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu). He was then made the deputy mayor of Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). In 781, Guan was recalled to Chang'an to serve as imperial attendant (給事中, Jishizhong). While serving at that post, he suggested that learned officials be put in charge of the various treasuries, which had previously been overseen by unlearned technicians; it was said that this change was followed later to the benefit of the state. He then served as deputy minister of justice (刑部侍郎, Xingbu Shilang). As Emperor Dezong's trusted chancellor Lu Qi viewed Guan as mild in temperament and easy to control, he repeatedly recommended Guan, who successively served as the minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang) and minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu). In 782, with Lu then serving as the only chancellor but knowing that Emperor Dezong, by custom, would want to commission at least one more chancellor, he recommended Guan to be chancellor. Emperor Dezong thereafter made Guan Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. He also gave Guan the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (), made him an imperial scholar, and put him in charge of editing the imperial history.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. It was said, however, that Lu dominated the government, and Guan did not participate in the decision-making. On one occasion, when Emperor Dezong was meeting with the chancellors, Guan heard a proposal that he considered inappropriate, and was ready to rise and speak against it, Lu gave him a look that caused him to hesitate. After the meeting was over, Lu told him, \\"I recommended you, sir, because you are solemn and quiet. How would you dare to open your mouth and speak?\\" Thereafter, Guan rarely spoke. It was also said, however, that Guan lacked judgment in the characters of others, and he endeared himself to a number of junior officials who bragged about their own abilities, including Li Yuanping (), Tao Gongda (), Zhang Sun (), and Liu Chengjie (). With Li Xilie the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) then posturing against the imperial government, Guan repeatedly recommended Li Yuanping, who had particularly bragged about his military strategies and impressed Guan. Emperor Dezong thus made Li Yuanping the acting prefect of Ru Prefecture (汝州, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan), as Ru Prefecture was close to Huaixi Circuit. When Li Yuanping arrived there, he immediately began reinforcing the defenses — but not realizing that of the laborers that he hired, many were agents that Li Xilie had sent. When Li Xilie attacked, those laborers turned against Li Yuanping, causing Ru Prefecture to fall to Li Xilie. Li Xilie's soldiers seized Li Yuanping and took him to Li Xilie. Li Yuanping, when meeting Li Xilie in fear, could not control his own body, and he defecated and urinated involuntarily. Li Xilie responded, \\"How does that blind chancellor think lightly of me, that he sent you to try to defend against me!\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. When Guan heard that Li Yuanping was captured, he still believed that Li Yuanping would find some way to overthrow Li Xilie, even though none of his subordinates believed it.New Book of Tang, vol. 151 . As a result of what happened to Li Yuanping, none of Guan's other associates were given important offices by Emperor Dezong. In fall 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at Chang'an to await deployment to the east, mutinied after not receiving awards that they believed they deserved. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), initially taking only his family members and a small group of eunuchs and imperial guards with him. Lu and fellow chancellor Guan Bo, in the confusion, had to jump over the walls of the office of chancellors, located at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), to catch up with Emperor Dezong. The Jingyuan soldiers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu soon declared a new state of Qin as its emperor. He put Fengtian under siege. A Tang aid force, commanded by the generals Du Xiquan (), Dai Xiuyan (), Shi Changchun (), and Li Jianhui (), was approaching Fengtian and requesting imperial instructions on which way to advance into the city. Guan and the general Hun Jian suggested having the aid force march over Qianling — the hill containing the tomb of Emperor Dezong's ancestor Emperor Gaozong — so that they would have better tactical position. Lu, arguing that doing so was disrespectful, suggested having the aid force march through a valley, despite Hun's protestations that doing so would expose the aid force to catapult attacks by Qin forces. Emperor Dezong agreed with Lu, and subsequently, the aid force was ambushed and, after suffering heavy losses, was forced to withdraw without ever reaching Fengtian. After the major general Li Huaiguang arrived and saved Fengtian from falling, Li Huaiguang demanded the removals of Lu, Bai Zhizhen (), and Zhao Zan () — demands that were supported by other officials — and Emperor Dezong was forced to agree. Subsequently, the popular sentiment also opined that Guan, as fellow chancellor to Lu during this disaster, should not be allowed to remain as chancellor, and Emperor Dezong made Guan the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) instead, no longer chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. Still, officials such as Wei Lun () were distressed that Guan remained an important minister, and they wailed, \\"The chancellor was unable to plan and assist the emperor properly, leading to this situation, but he is allowed to still be minister. This is distressing.\\" After Zhu's rebellion was suppressed, in 788, Huige's Heguduolu Khan Yaoluoge Dunmohe, who had entered an alliance with Tang, requested permission to marry a Tang princess. Emperor Dezong agreed and sent Guan to escort Emperor Dezong's daughter Princess Xian'an to Huige (which was subsequently renamed Huigu) to marry the khan and to bestow the title of Changshoutianqin Khan (or Tianqin 天親 Khan, \\"related to heaven\\" Sanping Chen, \\"Son of Heaven and Son of God: Interactions among Ancient Asiatic Cultures regarding Sacral Kingship and Theophoric Names\\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Third Series, Vol. 12, No. 3 (November 2002), p. 309 in short) on Yaoluoge Dunmohe.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. Guan was said to be quiet and not lavish on the way, impressing the people of Huigu. After he returned, Emperor Dezong wanted to make him the minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu), but he declined on account of illness and offered to resign. Emperor Dezong made him an advisor to the crown prince Li Song, and allowed him to retire. After his retirement, Guan retained few servants and reduced his numbers of horses and wagons, and he spent his retirement in quietness. For this, he was respected by the officials. He died in 797 and was publicly mourned.  Notes and references   External links  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 130. * New Book of Tang, vol. 151. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 227, 228, 229, 233.

The station, owned and operated by the Pendleton Broadcasting Company, began unlimited 5,000 watt operation at 1290 kHz on January 3, 1956. Pendleton Broadcasting Company was owned by the Fisher family as one of four Oregon radio stations controlled by the Fisher Stations Group. Pendleton Broadcasting Company, licensee of KUMA, was acquired by Theodore A. \\"Ted\\" Smith and his wife Phyllis on November 1, 1966. Ted Smith had joined Pendleton Broadcasting Company in 1955, as general manager of KUMA, after his service in the United States Navy. Ted Smith served as the president of the Oregon Association of Broadcasters in 1962. KUMA was joined by an FM sister station, dubbed KUMA-FM, in 1978. In September 1988, Ted and Phyllis Smith applied to the FCC to transfer control of the Pendleton Broadcasting Company to Gregory A. Smith, their son.

The club fields all senior and junior sides alongside the Corryong Netball Club. Their players are mainly from the Corryong area and also from Albury/Wodonga. History Corryong was a founding member in 1893 of the Corryong Football Association, a precursor of today's Upper Murray Football League, and with a total of thirty-one senior grade premierships to its credit the club is the most successful in the competition's history. That success commenced right away as Corryong won successive flags in 1893 and 1894 and by the time the competition went into recess in 1916 because of world war one it had added another nine, including four in succession between 1907 and 1910. During the 1920s Corryong was an almost perennial grand finalist, emerging triumphant on five occasions. It was less successful during the 1930s but still managed to claim a couple of flags. Following the second world war the club was consistently in the hunt for premiership honours and between 1948 and 1954 contested every grand final except one. However, it was successful only once, against Federal in 1951. It was a similar story during the late 1950s and the first half of the ensuing decade as, over the course of eight seasons, the Demons managed just a solitary grand final victory from half a dozen attempts. They ended the 1960s in style, however, overcoming Federal in the grand final of 1968 by 29 points and Cudgewa in the following season's play-off by a bare 2 point margin. Since their 1969 triumph the Demons have continued to amass flags at a steady rate. 2000 and Beyond The Demons were the powerhouse club of the competition during the first half of the decade. Between 2000 and 2005 Corryong's seniors won premierships in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005. These sides were made up of a strong local talent base combined with some experienced players from stronger district leagues proving the difference between themselves and the rest of the competition. The club also made grand finals in 2006 and 2008 with their last appearance in a grand final resulting in an embarrassing 108-point loss to Bullioh. A combination of the club's older players retiring and a number of locals leaving the area has resulted in the Demon's struggling down the bottom of the ladder for the last three season's with them finishing winless in 2011. Corryong Demons made another appearance against Cudgewa in the 2014 Grand Final, but unfortunately loss. In 2016 there was a three point loss in the Grand Final to rival Federal. However in 2017, Demons came home with the flag smashing Bullioh.

Oil on canvas, 136⅝ × 101¼ inches. Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, France. \\"She sank to the ground beside him, put her left arm round his knees, raised her right hand to touch his chin, and so made her petition to the Royal Son of Cronos\\", Iliad 1.500–502 Jupiter and Thetis is an 1811 painting by the French neoclassical painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, in the Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, France. Painted when the artist was yet 31, the work severely and pointedly contrasts the grandeur and might of a cloud-born Olympian male deity against that of a diminutive and half nude nymph. Ingres' subject matter is borrowed from an episode in Homer's Iliad when the sea nymph Thetis begs Jupiter to intervene and guide the fate of her son Achilles; who was at the time embroiled in the Trojan War.Rosenblum, 72 Style and subject The painting is steeped in the traditions of both classical and neoclassical art, most notably in its grand scale of 136⅝ × 101¼ inches.Kimmelman, Michael. \\"The peculiar realism of Ingres\\". International Herald Tribune, March 31, 2006. Retrieved on November 1, 2008. Ingres creates many visual contrasts between the god and the slithering nymph: Jupiter is shown facing the viewer frontally with both his arms and legs spread broadly across the canvas, while the color of his dress and flesh echoes that of the marble at his feet. In contrast, Thetis is rendered in sensuous curves and portrayed in supplication to the mercy of a cruel god who holds the fate of her son in his hands. Thetis' right hand falls on Jupiter's hip with a suggestion of erotic caress, while the dark green of her dress accents the dread and foreboding of the bare landscape behind. Her clothing is drawn up against her lower hip, and seems about to fall off. The focal point of the work is Thetis' left hand extended vertically upright as she attempts to stroke the beard of the god. Jupiter's pose is closely based on that of the famous chryselephantine sculpture, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Zeus being Jupiter's Greek equivalent), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This was made by the Greek sculptor of the Classical period, Phidias, circa 432 BC and destroyed in Antiquity, but its pose is known from coins and small replicas. Here the pose is reversed right to left, and the arm to the viewer's right is higher than in the original, which held out a statue of Nike. Jupiter and Thetis was painted to meet the artist's obligations to the French Academy in Rome, and although its overhand tone correctly reflected the patriarchal bias of Napoleon's regime in its contrast between male power and female subservience,Boime, Albert. Art in an Age of Bonapartism, 1800-1815. Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1993. 206-207. it is generally regarded as a rejection of such values.Rosenblum, 72 Ingres highly regarded the painting, and in a manner it marries the great motifs of his career: the voluptuousness of the female character and the authoritative austerity on the male deity. Ingres kept Jupiter and Thetis in his studio until 1834, when it was purchased by the state. In 1848, he made a single pencil copy. The painting was first exhibited at the 1811 Paris Salon,Symmons, Sarah. \\"J. A. D. Ingres: The Apotheosis of Flaxman\\". The Burlington Magazine, Volume 121, Number 920. 1979. 721-731 at a time when Ingres' attention to line coupled with his disregard for anatomical reality was yet to find favour among critics.

Written by series creator David E. Kelley and directed by Alan Myerson, the episode originally aired on April 29, 1993. The episode caused controversy because it depicted 16-year-old lead character Kimberly Brock engaged in same- sex kissing with her best friend and frankly discussing her sexuality. \\"Sugar & Spice\\" was an early entry on a list of American television episodes in which a lesbian or possibly lesbian character kisses a straight-identifying character. These lesbian kiss episodes often occurred during times of the year when networks were most concerned about generating ratings, and have come to be viewed by some critics as gimmicks to help secure those ratings. The controversy generated by \\"Sugar & Spice\\" and other lesbian kiss episodes led to a chilling effect on the non-sensationalized presentation of same-sex intimacy on network television through most of the rest of the 1990s. Plot Kimberly Brock (Holly Marie Combs) and her best friend Lisa Fenn (Alexondra Lee) exchange several experimental kisses during a sleepover at Kimberly's house, the first kiss being a chaste peck with the later kisses becoming more intimate. Kimberly's younger brother Matthew (Justin Shenkarow) eavesdrops on the girls the next day when they discuss the incident and their feelings. He goes to his mother, town doctor Jill Brock (Kathy Baker) and tells her that Kimberly is a \\"lesbo\\". A patient overhears and word of the kissing spreads through the town. Kimberly's father, Sheriff Jimmy Brock (Tom Skerritt) and stepmother Jill react poorly to the idea that their daughter might be a lesbian, debating \\"nature vs. nurture\\" and \\"elective lesbianism\\" and even renting \\"hunk films\\" starring Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner. Kimberly turns to her birth mother, Lydia (Cristine Rose), who had had a lesbian relationship in college. Lydia advises her that her relationship with another woman was during the women's movement and that while she enjoyed her time with the woman she realized that she was confusing feelings of intimacy with sexuality. Lisa and Kimberly talk further. Lisa acknowledges that she is in love with Kimberly but Kimberly lets her know that she is unable to return those feelings. In a secondary plot, male Sheriff's deputy Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) is given a promotion over female deputy Maxine Stuart (Lauren Holly) after she is asked in her interview about such things as whether she was planning to get married and get pregnant in the near future. She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him. Production Kimberly and Lisa's first, more chaste, kiss. Note the difference in lighting levels. Before \\"Sugar & Spice\\" aired, CBS, fearing sponsor pullouts and viewer backlash, demanded revisions to the kissing scene. According to Kelley in a Los Angeles Times interview, the network initially suggested fading to black before the second more intimate kiss, then suggested cutting away before the kiss to a shot of one of Kimberly's brothers eavesdropping.Quoted in Becker, p. 148 Eventually, the network and Kelley settled on reshooting the kissing scene in darkness. In the episode as aired, a line of dialog is inserted over a shot of the exterior of the Brock house to explain why the room is suddenly dark. Reception Network affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, which had earlier refused to air an episode dealing with polygamy, also refused to air this episode.Tropiano, et al., p. 162 In a move described by Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters as \\"a prime example of network hypocrisy\\", CBS released the original footage along with the reshot scene to Entertainment Tonight, which generated enormous publicity for the episode. Television critic John Martin described this episode as indicative of the way that Picket Fences deftly blended ethical and social issues with family concerns. =The \\"lesbian kiss episode\\"= Picket Fences was one of the first American television series to feature an intimate kiss between two women. Two years earlier, L. A. Law had aired an episode (also written by Kelley) that included a kiss between bisexual-identified character C. J. Lamb (Amanda Donohoe) and straight-identifying Abby Perkins (Michele Greene). The kiss led to complaints to the network and five sponsors pulled their ads from the episode. In reviewing incidents of lesbian kisses on network television programs, the New York Times noted that they tended to happen during \\"sweeps\\" periods, when the networks use Nielsen ratings to determine advertising rates. Noting lesbian kisses during sweeps periods on such shows as L. A. Law, Roseanne, Party of Five and Ally McBeal in addition to the Picket Fences episode and noting that they were occurring about once per year, the Times concludes that kisses between women are: > \\"Eminently visual; cheap, provided the actors are willing; controversial, > year in and year out; and elegantly reversible (sweeps lesbians typically > vanish or go straight when the week's over), kisses between women are > perfect sweeps stunts. They offer something for everyone, from advocacy > groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from > goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand > psychological complexity to plot buffs.\\" The Guardian concurred in this assessment, calling the lesbian kiss episode \\"a clear sign of desperation and a show running out of ideas...Snogging The Friend is the new Jumping The Shark.\\" Michele Greene confirmed in an interview with AfterEllen.com that her kiss with Amanda Donohoe's C. J. was a ratings ploy and that there was never any intention on the part of producers to seriously explore the possibility of a relationship between two women. During a period in network television history when producers were pushing the broadcast boundaries on sexually explicit content with such shows as NYPD Blue, the controversy over this and other television episodes that made inroads into presenting same-sex sexuality or affection led producers not to present any sexualization of their gay and lesbian characters. As noted by author Ron Becker, > \\"So viewers got to see Carol and Susan wed on Friends, but they didn't get > to see them kiss. And fans of NYPD Blue could hear male hustlers talk about > their johns, but the only sex they got to see involved the precinct's > straight cops—naked butts and all.

The DPP is the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), with personal responsibility for its 7,000 staff and approximately 800,000 prosecutions undertaken by it every year. The holder of the role is appointed by the Attorney General on the recommendation of a panel that includes the First Civil Service Commissioner. First created in 1879, the office was merged with that of the Treasury Solicitor five years later,Hansard, 23 March 1888 before again becoming independent in 1908. The Director's department and role underwent modernisation from 1944 to 1964 under Sir Theobald Mathew QC, and further expansion with the introduction of the CPS in 1985, which came under the control of the Director. The Director is superintended by the Attorney General, who answers for the CPS in Parliament. The current director is Max Hill QC. History A Director of Public Prosecutions was first recommended by the Criminal Law Commission in 1845, who said that: The County and Borough Police Act 1856 allowed the Home Office to ask the Treasury Solicitor's Department to take on cases of particular importance, but this left many cases falling through the net. As a result, the Prosecution of Offences Act 1879 was passed, which created a Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to advise the police and personally act in cases of importance; an elaboration on the 1856 Act.Rozenberg (1987) p.17 The first appointee was Sir John Maule QC, who took up his post in 1880. Maule was a quiet, reserved and cautious man, who interpreted his powers in an unnecessarily restrictive way, feeling that he could do little more than send cases to the Treasury Solicitor's office, and that it was not the job of the DPP to prosecute cases. He came under harsh criticism, which reached a head in 1883 when he refused to authorise prosecution of a pair of blackmailers, who were instead prosecuted privately, convicted and given heavy sentences. As a result of the fallout, the Home Secretary William Harcourt set up a committee into \\"the present action and position of the Director of Public Prosecutions\\".Rozenberg (1987) p.19 The Committee concluded that the DPP's job, in which he took no practical part in prosecutions, would be best unified into the job of the Treasury Solicitor. This was accepted, and the DPP \\"vanished in all but name\\". Successors for the rest of the century held both titles, and both jobs, thanks to the Prosecution of Offences Act 1884.Rozenberg (1987) p.20 The next few appointees were unimportant and uncontroversial, until Sir Charles Willie Matthews QC, a man Rozenberg describes as \\"the first real DPP\\". The Prosecution of Offenses Act 1908 repealed the section of the 1884 Act that unified the DPP and Treasury Solicitor, giving Matthews an office of his own on his appointment in the same year.Rozenberg (1987) p.22 The organisation remained rooted in its Victorian origins, still operating under the 1886 Prosecutions of Offences Regulations, until the appointment of Sir Theobald Mathew in 1944. The youngest man (and only solicitor) to be appointed DPP at that time,Rozenberg (1987) p.26 Matthews modernised the office, updating the Prosecutions of Offences Regulations, introducing trunk dialling and using dictaphones to make up for the small number of shorthand typists. He reorganised and modernised the department as a whole, and many of his modifications are still in place; for example, a provision in many new Acts of Parliament dealing with the criminal law that requires the consent of the DPP for a prosecution.Rozenberg (1987) p.27 At the same time he battled with the Civil Service for an increase in staff numbers, securing the appointment of three new Assistant Solicitors in the late 1950s; a large leap for a staff which had previously numbered five, excluding secretaries.Rozenberg (1987) p.30 The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 created the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 1986, a dedicated, nationwide prosecution service under the control of the DPP, then Sir Thomas Hetherington QC. This involved the recruitment of 3,000 new staff, which despite difficulties the DPP succeeded in doing. The CPS now handles the vast majority of prosecutions.Rozenberg (1987) p.89 In 2011, the DPP was given veto power over arrest warrants following a 2009 warrant for the arrest of Tzipi Livni issued by Westminster Magistrates' Court. =List of Directors= # Sir John Maule QC (1880–1884) # Sir Augustus Stephenson QC (1884–1894; also Treasury Solicitor) # Lord Desart QC (1894–1908; also Treasury Solicitor) # Sir Charles Willie Matthews QC (1908–1920) # Sir Archibald Bodkin QC (1920–1930) # Sir Edward Tindal Atkinson QC (1930–1944) #Sir Theobald Mathew KBE MC (1944–1964) # Sir Norman Skelhorn QC (1964–1977) # Sir Thomas Hetherington QC (1977–1987; first head of CPS) # Sir Allan Green QC (1987–1992) # Dame Barbara Mills DBE QC (1992–1998) # Sir David Calvert-Smith QC (1998–2003) # Sir Ken Macdonald QC (2003–2008) # Sir Keir Starmer KCB QC (2008–2013) # Dame Alison Saunders CB (2013–2018) # Max Hill QC (2018–present) References Bibliography * ","title":"Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)"},{"id":"20020356","title":"Kalk, Cologne"},{"id":"20020360","text":"Coronado Island and the Gulf of California, Mexico Isla Coronado, also known as “Smith Island” on some maps, is just off the eastern shoreline of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, near Bahía de los Ángeles, in the Gulf of California. The island is approximately 7 kilometers long, and it is dominated by a volcano on its northern end. It is part of the Ensenada Municipality. Isla Coronado in the Sea of Cortez Environment Isla Coronado — similar to nearby Isla Coronadito, Isla Mitlan and Isla Calavera - has an arid climate and is sparsely vegetated. Despite the harshness of the environment, sea lion colonies can be found on the island. Partly in response to increased environmental pressure on the islands from both fishing and tourism, local groups developed a management and conservation plan for the islands in the bay, with international support, in the late 1990s. =Volcano= Coronado () is a volcano on the island. The date of the last eruption of the volcano is not known, but gas and steam activity was last recorded in 1539. =Biology= The island has seven species of reptiles: Aspidoscelis tigris (tiger whiptail), Callisaurus draconoides (zebra-tailed lizard), Crotalus mitchellii (speckled rattlesnake), Hypsiglena ochrorhyncha (coast night snake), Phyllodactylus nocticolus (peninsular leaf-toed gecko), Sauromalus hispidus (spiny chuckwalla), and Uta stansburiana (common side-blotched lizard). =Marine life= The island is an important piece of the ecology of the Gulf of California. In 1940, marine biologist Ed Ricketts, together with his friend, author John Steinbeck, conducted an expedition and collecting trip in the Gulf of California (sometimes known as the Sea of Cortez) to explore the rich ecology of the intertidal zone. Coronado Island and the Bahía de los Ángeles were part of that expedition. The resulting book by Steinbeck and Ricketts, The Log from the Sea of Cortez, remains a classic document of the natural history and ecology of the Gulf of California. Today, the uninhabited island is a refuge with a rich marine assemblage, especially when compared to other, unprotected parts of the Gulf. This image provides hints of the diverse marine environment around the island. Most of the coast is steep and rocky, but lighter blue lagoons, especially along the western coast, provide shallower, protected environments that are biologically robust. Offshore, internal waves and complex surface currents facilitate mixing of the water, important for nutrient delivery to the coastal environments. These water patterns are outlined by sunglint (light reflecting off of the water surface back towards the camera on board the International Space Station). The sunglint patterns are due to wind and currents, which roughen the water surface and enhance reflection, and surfactants that decrease the surface tension and roughness, resulting in regions of dark, smooth water.

Using live, archival, and interview footage shot in Los Angeles, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, and Windsor in Berkshire, England, it explores the history and environment behind the development of local and nationally acclaimed musical talent in Western Australia. The film was funded by Perth media production company WBMC, headed by screenwriter/director Aidan O'Bryan and producer Janelle Landers. The film follows the rise to fame of some of Western Australia's most successful musicians. Something in the Water features more than fifty interviews with bands including Little Birdy, The Waifs, The Sleepy Jackson, Eskimo Joe, End of Fashion, Jebediah, Le Hoodoo Gurus, The Panics and Red Jezebel. The film asks whether Perth's talented spawn can be attributed to the city's isolation, the environment or the music scene itself, or whether there is, in fact, something in the water. Something in the Water premiered at the Astor Theatre in Perth and had a limited theatrical run in that city. It later was shown at the FTI Fremantle Film Festival and the 2008 WAMi Festival. An accompanying two-disc compilation of various Western Australian artists became available via MGM Distribution as well as online in January 2009. The film was screened on ABC2 on 13 May 2009. Following this national broadcast, the film was released on DVD on 3 July 2009 via MGM Distribution.

Its purpose is that of knowledge dissemination, and not professional validation or academic competence. Knowledge dissemination is important in the veterinary profession to prevent a knowledge divide. History =National Veterinary Association= A preceding organisation started out as the National Veterinary Association in 1882 after the first ever British National Veterinary Congress in July 1881. A vet, George Banham, had suggested the idea of a national veterinary association. George Fleming, the principal vet to the Armed Forces, was the first elected president. The association was open to any vet, no matter which country they were from, on the payment of half a guinea. Other previous veterinary associations still co-existed though. It had an informal organisation and meetings across the country were arranged on an ad hoc basis. This style of organisation did not suit many vets, who wanted an organisation where they could discuss matters which did not or could not be discussed by the RCVS. In 1909 at a meeting of the Scottish Metropolitan Veterinary Association, Professor Orlando Charnock Bradley of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, called for a 'one single British veterinary association'. The idea was generally accepted, but the First World War stopped anything from happening. =National Veterinary Medical Association= At a meeting on 31 October 1919 the National Veterinary Medical Association was formed. Orlando Charnock Bradley became this association's first president. The co-existent veterinary associations no longer continued. The NVMA became a coherent regulated organisation and started to achieve things for vets, the country, and not-least the world. It has profoundly helped animal welfare and food production. In 1952, it became the BVA. In 1984, it founded the BVA Animal Welfare Foundation. Activities The organisation issues advice and the consensus of professional opinion to members and to the general public about veterinary issues as they arise in current events or trends, such as Avian flu, foot and mouth, and Brexit. The organisation has over 18,000 members. =Structure= The current president is Daniella Dos Santos. The current senior vice president is Simon Doherty and the current junior vice president is James Russell. The association's headquarters is situated on Mansfield Street, Marylebone, London. Publications British Veterinary Association works with contractor BMJ to publish the BVA's journals, the Veterinary Record and In Practice. The latter dates back to 1979 and is published ten times a year. The Veterinary Record has been in publication since 1888 with members able to search within its voluminous archives dating back to 1996.

The firm operates as both a private equity firm and as a hedge fund. Avenue's core strategy is focused on distressed debt and equity securities although the firm also manages investment funds that focus on long-short opportunities, real estate, and collateralized debt obligations. The firm manages assets valued at approximately $9.5 billion.url=https://www.avenuecapital.com/ The firm was founded by former professionals of Amroc Investments, an affiliate of the Robert M. Bass Group. The firm is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Luxembourg, Munich, Beijing, Hong Kong, New Delhi and Singapore. The firm has established an institutional-quality infrastructure in terms of accounting, compliance legal, investor relations, and information technology capabilities. Avenue has approximately 220 employees across its 8 offices worldwide. Avenue's investment professionals seek \\"good companies with bad balance sheets\\" — firms with sustainable businesses and positive cash flow but whose financial situation is distressed. The investment team uses Avenue's top-down/bottom-up approach to find undervalued opportunities and typically seeks to make non-operational control investments in troubled businesses. This provides the strategy maximum trading flexibility and allows Avenue's investment professionals to focus on pre-investment research and analysis rather than post-investment operating issues. From 2006 to 2009, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former President of the United States Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, worked as an associate at Avenue Capital Group LLC. Bloomberg reported that as of February 28, 2010, Avenue Capital Group is the 13th largest hedge fund in the world. History Avenue Capital Group was founded in 1995 by siblings Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner. The two founders had previously founded Amroc Investments in 1989 as a $100 million distressed debt investment fund organized in association with the Robert M. Bass Group. In 1995, Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner started their first Avenue fund, Avenue Investments, with less than $10 million. This onshore fund has grown to $509 million as of December 31, 2012. In 1997, Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner formed their second Avenue fund called Avenue International. This offshore fund attracts U.S. tax exempt and non-U.S. investors. As of December 31, 2012, Avenue International has $1,461 million in assets under management. In 2012, The firm was featured in Maneet Ahuja's book, The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds. In February, 2016 Marc Lasry explained on CNBC that Avenue Capital was taking advantage of the opportunity to purchase loans from European Banks at a discount. As Lasry said: \\"Most banks are being forced by the European Central Bank to sell loans and therefore we're able to buy those loans at a great discount. The ECB will likely continue to put pressure on these banks to clean up their balance sheet.\\" In August 2018, it was announced Avenue Capital has invested €250million ($278 million) in Castlehaven Finance, an Irish construction sector lending platform. Since its inception in 1995, Avenue has raised 14 private equity style investment funds across its three principal regions (US, Europe and Asia) to invest in distressed securities and real estate: Avenue launched its Asian-focused distressed business in 1999. In 2004, Avenue launched its European-focused distressed business with Rich Furst as the senior portfolio manager. While building distressed debt, the European branch of the firm also writes loans for small companies that are unable to obtain financing. Ownership In October 2006, Morgan Stanley bought a non- controlling 15% stake in the firm. Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner invested 100% of the proceeds they received from Morgan Stanley back into the Avenue funds. Corporate responsibility In 2014, Avenue Capital Group raised over $68,000 for HerJustice, a New York-based organisation devoted to ending domestic violence. Avenue Capital Group served as a sponsor in 2010 and 2011 and, in July 2012 Avenue's President, Sonia Gardner, hosted a breakfast on inMotion's behalf to encourage other firms to participate. Ms Gardner was again honored in 2014 at the Annual Photography Auction & Benefit for Her Justice. In January 2016 Marc Lasry participated in \\"Portfolios with Purpose,\\" in which participants compete on behalf of their favorite charities. In April 2018 the firm was reported to be launching a $500 million fund focused on impact investing.

The mirages might be observed for such celestial objects as the Sun, the Moon, the planets, bright stars, and very bright comets. The most commonly observed of these are sunset and sunrise mirages. Mirages versus refraction Mirages are distinguished from other phenomena caused by atmospheric refraction. One of the most prominent features of mirages is that a mirage might only produce images vertically, not sideways, while a simple refraction might distort and bend the images in any way. The distortion in both images displayed in this section was caused by refraction, but while the image on the left, which is a mirage, demonstrates only vertical distortion, the image on the right demonstrates distortion in all the ways possible. It is easier to see the vertical direction of the mirage not even at the mirage of the Sun itself, but rather at the mirage of a sunspot. As a matter of fact, it is at least a three-image mirage of a sunspot, and all these images show a clear vertical direction. Superior mirage (3-image mirage) of sunspot #930 An image of the Golden Gate Bridge is refracted and bent by droplets of water. Inferior mirage of astronomical objects Inferior mirage of comet left Etruscan vase stage of inferior mirage sunset in 150px Omega Sun stage of inferior mirage sunset in 150px Inferior mirage of astronomical objects is the most common mirage. Inferior mirage occurs when the surface of the Earth or the oceans produces a layer of hot air of lower density, just at the surface. There are two images, the inverted one and the erect one, in inferior mirage. They both are displaced from the geometric direction to the actual object. While the erect image is setting, the inverted image appears to be rising from the surface. The shapes of inferior mirage sunsets and sunrises stay the same for all inferior mirage sunsets and sunrises. One well-known shape, the Etruscan vase, was named by Jules Verne. As the sunset progresses the shape of Etruscan vase slowly changes; the stem of the vase gets shorter until the real and the miraged Suns create a new shape – Greek letter omega Ω. The inferior mirage got its name because the inverted image appears below the erect one.An Introduction to Mirages by Andy Young Here's how Jules Verne describes an inferior mirage sunset. : On very rare occasions the mirages of astronomical objects other than the Sun and the Moon might be observed. An apparent magnitude of an astronomical object should be low enough (that is, bright enough) in order to see it as not only a real object, but also a miraged one. Mock mirage of astronomical objects 150px A mock mirage of astronomical objects is much more complex than an inferior mirage. While an inferior mirage of astronomical objects can produce only two images, a mock mirage can produce multiple miraged images. The shapes of the miraged object are changing constantly and unpredictably. In order for a mock mirage to appear, the cooler air needs to be trapped below the inversion. Several inversion layers produce multiple pancake-like shapes.Sunset Mirages Les Cowley It is possible that the solar anomaly mentioned in the Book of Joshua may have been an example of a mock mirage. In that tale, Joshua launched a surprise attack on the Amorites following a night march, causing the Amorites to panic and flee as far as Beth-horon, but they did not find a safe haven there. \\"...they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\\" The Book of Joshua 10.11 Joshua Hailstones are a rare event in deserts and are a good precondition for creating a mock/superior mirage of the setting sun. Inferior mirage is the most common mirage in the deserts. When the Israelites went from a hot desert to a hail-covered desert to fight the Amorites, the inversion layers could have created a mock mirage of the setting sun. To the Israelites, the sun would then have appeared to stand still. A poem is quoted from the Book of Jasher, which states that the sun stood still at Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, in order that Joshua could complete the battle.The Book of Joshua 10.13 Joshua Joshua commands the sun to stand still in the sky The Book of Joshua 10.13 Joshua thumb Novaya Zemlya effect Due to a normal atmospheric refraction, sunrise occurs shortly before the Sun crosses above the horizon. Light from the Sun is bent, or refracted, as it enters earth's atmosphere. This effect causes the apparent sunrise to be earlier than the actual sunrise. Similarly, apparent sunset occurs slightly later than actual sunset. In ordinary atmospheric conditions, the setting or rising Sun appears to be about half a degree above its geometric position. But sometimes, very unusual atmospheric circumstances can make it to be visible when it is really between two and five degrees below the horizon. This is called the Novaya Zemlya effect, because it was first observed in Novaya Zemlya, where the Sun was seen when, according to astronomical calculations, it should have been two degrees below the horizon. However, due to changes in air pressure, relative humidity, and other quantities, the exact effects of atmospheric refraction on sunrise and sunset time cannot be predicted. Also note that this possible error increases with higher (closer to the poles) latitudes. This mock mirage sunset was photographed in San Francisco four minutes later than apparent sunset time. It cannot be considered the Novaya Zemlya effect, yet it gives a good visual representation of what Fridtjof Nansen may have seen when he was observing the Novaya Zemlya effect. Novaya Zemlya is a polar region in Russia. The Novaya Zemlya effect is a mirage caused by high refraction of sunlight between atmospheric thermoclines. The Novaya Zemlya effect will give the impression that the sun is rising earlier than it actually should or the sun is setting later than it actually should. Fridtjof Nansen wrote It is possible to observe the Novaya Zemlya effect in any place, where the temperature variations are great enough to produce a high refraction. Green flash Green flash is a rare optical phenomenon that occurs during or shortly after set and during or before rise of a bright astronomical object, when a green spot is visible for a short period of time above a mirage of an astronomical object or its set/rise point. Green flashes are enhanced by atmospheric inversions which increase the density gradient in the atmosphere, and therefore increase refraction. In other words, to see a green flash a mirage should be present.Explaining Green Flashes by Andy Young Jules Verne described a green flash. Many tend to believe that seeing a green flash brings good luck.K. Solarino : The Green Flash Collection 350px right Green flashes might be observed from any place with a low horizon. Deserts, oceans and ice shelves are probably the best places to observe mirages and therefore green flashes. It is easier not to miss a green flash during sunset than during sunrise. It is especially true regarding an inferior mirage green flash, when the timing should be just right to capture it at sunrise. From the above observation it is clear that the author observed an inferior mirage green flash, when the much warmer surface of the desert with the help of the rising Sun was fighting the cool morning air, producing in the process a green flash – one of nature's great spectacles. A green flash might be also seen with a rising or setting Moon. In the right conditions it is common to observe multiple green flashes during one mock mirage sunset. Some claim they saw a green flash from Venus. This may be true, but it might be that a color of the setting or the rising planet is mistaken for a real green flash that is a by-product of a mirage. Green rim The upper rim of the Sun is green while the lower rim is red in this image taken as the Sun sets behind the Golden Gate Bridge. As an astronomical object sets or rises, the light it emits travels through the atmosphere, which works as a prism separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper limb of an astronomical object could go from blue to green to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of pollutants as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere. The lower limb of an astronomical object is always red. The green rim is very thin, and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter, when an astronomical object is very low above the horizon because of atmospheric reddening, but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon. The following quote describes probably the longest observation of a green rim, which sometimes could have been a green flash. Members of Richard E. Byrd's party from the Little America exploration base saw the phenomenon on and off for 35 minutes. Green rim and green flashes of the setting Sun Often the green rim of the setting Sun will change to a green flash and then back again to a green rim during the same sunset. The image to the right might accurately illustrate what members of Byrd's party from the Little America base might have seen. However, to see a green rim and green flash on and off for 35 minutes, there must have been some degree of mirage present. A green rim is present in every sunset, but it is too thin to be seen with a naked eye. The best time to observe the green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset time. However, the solar disc is too bright at that time to use magnification, such as binoculars or telescopes, to look directly at the Sun. Of course, a telescope or binoculars image can be projected on a sheet of paper for viewing. When the Sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim gets fainter because of atmospheric reddening. Although a green rim is present in every sunset, and a green flash is rare because it requires a mirage to be present, but despite this, it is actually more common for people to have seen a green flash rather than a green rim. Not a mirage left camera lens, and not a mirage250pxthumb The composite image on the left is made out of five frames of different sunsets. None of the images is a mirage. Frames # 1 and # 2 could fool even a very experienced observer. They do look like a mock mirage of the setting Sun, but they are not. Frames #3 and # 4 are clearly not a mirage. Frame # 5 is not a mirage and not even a sunspot, it is a spider with the Sun as a background. The strange shapes of the Sun in this composite is due to vog and clouds. Numerous atmospheric effects, such as vog, clouds, smoke, smog and others could generate a mirage like appearance of an astronomical object. Lens flares and ghost images also might be responsible for a false mirage or a false green flash.

Between the World Wars when Bosnia and Herzegovina were part of Yugoslavia, several members of Yugoslavian royalty had contact with prominent members of the religion. During the period of Communism in Yugoslavia, the first member of the Baháʼí Faith was in 1963 and the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in 1990. With the Yugoslavian civil war and separation into Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Baháʼís had not elected a Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly but do have a small population in a few regions in the country. Early days Before 1918, the regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina were part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the members of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets mentioned European regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Austria-Hungary. He says: > \\"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the > hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the > longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of > men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace.

Before World War II Yugoslavia continued to be ruled by monarchs and among them there was awareness of the Baháʼí Faith. In July, 1938, Marie of Edinburgh, a member of the religion and Queen of Rumania, died. A message of condolence was communicated, in the name of all Baháʼí communities in East and West, to her daughter, Maria, then Queen of Yugoslavia, to which she replied expressing \\"sincere thanks to all of Baháʼu'lláh's followers.\\" Later Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, on being informed of the death of Hand of the Cause Martha Root in 1939, remarked “She was so kind and gentle, and a real worker for peace. I am sure she will be sadly missed in her work.” Following the disruption of World War II and oppression during the early period of communism (see for example what happened to the much larger Baháʼí community in Turkmenistan) the first member of the Baháʼí Faith in Yugoslavia was an isolated Baháʼí in Belgrade who converted to the religion in 1963. Growth Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However in the Soviet Block the Baháʼís had all but disappeared. With the relaxation of the restrictions of Communism through Perestroyka, Yugoslavia's first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was established in November 1990 in Belgrade though the World Christian Encyclopedia maintained there were no Baháʼís in the country then. By 1998 Yugoslavia was torn by civil war and did not have a Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly. Activities increased with a burgeoning community of Baháʼís. In 2001, Baháʼí youth gathered for a dance workshop (see Oscar DeGruy) in Zenica By 2003 Baháʼís had organized Bosnia and Herzegovina into 17 subregions, and four of these contained at least one Baháʼí and a few Ruhi Institute study circles were operating. Despite this, the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) still estimated there were no Baháʼís in the country. Modern community The small community of Baha'is of Bosnia and Herzegovina has continued to have a presence in events beyond the confines of the country. In November 2004 membership of Baha'i inspired General Assembly of the International Environment Forum lists one member. In February 2008 the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina aligned themselves with the declaration of the President of Slovenia on behalf of the European Union on the deteriorating situation of the Baháʼís in Iran.

Concept The \\"ideal\\" nature of such a city may encompass the moral, spiritual and juridical qualities of citizenship as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc. The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of Roman town planning) or other geometrical patterns. The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy Utopian ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as St Thomas More's Utopia. History The ideal city attributed to Luciano Laurana or Melozzo da Forlì Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the Renaissance, and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of Plato, whose Republic is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'. The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of Classical civilisation, sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture. Examples Plan of Sforzinda, Filarete, c. 1465 Examples of the ideal cities include Filarete's \\"Sforzinda\\", a description of which was included in Trattato di architettura (c. 1465). The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular moat. Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called \\"Urbino\\" and \\"Baltimore\\" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show classically influenced architecture disposed in logically planned piazzas. Map of Palmanova in 1593. The town is encircled by massive Venetian Defensive Systems that are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cities of Palmanova and Nicosia, whose Venetian Fortesses were built in the 1590s by the Venetian Republic, are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city. Another notable example of the concept is Zamość in eastern Poland, founded in the late 16th century and modelled by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando. James Oglethorpe synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new Enlightenment ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the Province of Carolina. The physical design component of the famous Oglethorpe Plan remains preserved in the Savannah Historic District.Wilson, Thomas D. The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012. Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the Garden city movement of Sir Ebenezer Howard, realised at Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City in England. Poundbury, Prince Charles' architectural vision established in Dorset, is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning. Built in 1950s Nowa Huta in Kraków, Poland, serves as an unfinished example of a Utopian ideal city.

The game was notable for its unique take on the genre and approach to mathematical entities and abstract concepts. In one section the player must navigate a text adventure game, inside the text adventure game. In another the player, while asleep, derives a proof using physical representations of various symbolic logic components. The game is intentionally vague using a VERB NOUN gameplay mechanic with a vocabulary of just 200. In 1988 the game was ported to Atari ST, MS-DOS and Solaris environments and, in 2003, to interactive fiction standard of machine- independent Z-code.  Original release notes  Scenario: \\"You have reached the final part of your mission. You have gained access to the complex, and all but the last procedure has been performed. Now comes a time of waiting, in which you must search for the hidden 12-word message that will aid you at the final step. But what choice will you make when that time comes?\\" The scenario for the adventure is meant to be vague. Once the adventure has been completed, the scenario will hopefully become clear. Instructions: This adventure recognizes the standard commands for moving (N, E, S, W), taking inventory (I), manipulating objects (GET, DROP, LOOK), and saving games (SAVE, LOAD), as well as many others. Use 2-word 'verb noun' commands, such as 'use stack' or 'get all'. Only the first four letters of each word are significant. The adventure recognizes about 200 words, so if one word does not work, try another. Notes: \\"The \\"stack\\" is an acronym for Space Time Activated Continuum Key. You will find this object very useful. Try the command \\"use stack\\".\\" This adventure is abstract and a bit on the technical side. Basic knowledge of the names of interesting mathematical objects would be a definite asset in solving the puzzles. However, detailed knowledge of the technical background is not necessary, although it will make the adventure more enjoyable and reduce the amount of comments of the form \\"Was that supposed to be funny or what? I don't get it.\\" There is no carry limit, no death traps, and over 200 words in the program's vocabulary, so the player can hopefully concentrate on solving the adventure instead of solving the program. The map of the adventure can be draw on a grid. All it takes is a little experimenting to put all the subsets of locations together \\"logically\\". History: The idea of a mathematically abstract adventure came about during the summer of 1983, when I was reading the book \\"Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\\". I had just read an article on writing adventures, and I thought about doing my own article on adventure writing. I did start on the article, and one of the examples of how varied puzzles can be is a mathematical adventure where the player has to \\"use a probability function to cross a field of improbability to get to a vortex.\\" Sadly the article was never finished, although remnants of it can be found in the ADV.DOC file. I started thinking more and more about a mathematically abstract adventure, and Tesseract was born! The very first adventure that I wrote was in 1982, titled \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" (find the Crystal of Light). Tesseract Version 1.0 was the second of the three TRS-80 BASIC adventures that I wrote in a two-month adventure-frenzy during the summer of 1983.

AAF Serial Numbers 44-63325, 44-63314, 44-63474, 44-63428 The 45th Fighter Squadron is a United States Air Force Reserve unit. It is assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command's (AFRC) 924th Fighter Group and stationed at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The squadron currently flies the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. Mission The squadron trains A-10 Thunderbolt II pilots, operating and maintaining the aircraft of the 355th Fighter Wing, the regular A-10 unit at Davis Monthan. The A-10 formal training includes initial qualification in the airplane, transition training, instructor pilot upgrade training and a senior officer course. History =World War II= The history of the 45th Fighter Squadron goes back to 22 November 1940, when the War Department constituted the 45th Pursuit Squadron (Fighter). The unit was activated at Wheeler Field, Hawaii on 1 December 1940, where it served as part of the 15th Pursuit Group in defense of Hawaii. When the Japanese launched their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the 45th suffered heavy losses, as did the other squadrons in the 15th Group. Two-thirds of the Curtiss P-36 Hawk and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft at Wheeler Field were destroyed on the ground. Earlier, the planes had been stripped of ammunition and fuel, and taken out of their protective earthen revetments because of potential for sabotage in these protected but difficult- to-see areas. Parked in the open, the planes were easy targets for the Japanese pilots as they strafed and bombed the field. Everyone on the ground scrambled for cover as the field was being hit, while at the same time pilots were trying to get their planes off the ground without too much success. However, Lieutenants George Welch and Kenneth Taylor, two pilots from the 47th Pursuit Squadron whose planes were at Haleiwa Field at the time, were able to get their Curtis P-40B Tomahawks into the air soon after the attack began. Although outnumbered, they still managed to shoot down six Japanese planes. Meanwhile, Captain Aaron Tyler, commander of the 45th at Wheeler, ordered his crews to pull out all the undamaged planes they could find and have them fueled and armed. Less than a dozen aircraft were available, but the pilots who were selected to fly wasted no time boarding their planes. They quickly took off, hoping to tangle with the Japanese fighters. After searching the area for almost an hour, all they saw as they flew over Pearl Harbor were the burning ships and immense damage. By this time, the Japanese planes were long gone, having already headed back to their carrier at sea. In the days following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the pilots and ground personnel of the 45th had the job of cleaning up the mess at Wheeler Field. Among the first things they did was put the remaining aircraft back into their revetments. After moving their flight operations to different fields in Hawaii, the 45th was back in the air conducting daily air defense patrols over the islands. These long flights put a heavy toll on the P-36s and P-40Bs that the pilots flew, so they requested new aircraft. The pilots soon received new Curtiss P-40E Warhawk and the tricycle-gear Bell P-39 Airacobra. On 12 February 1942, the squadron was redesignated the 45th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor). Although the 45th still had as its primary mission the conducting of aerial patrols, it was also given the duties of conducting combat training for pilots. Three months later, on 15 May 1942, the term \\"pursuit\\" was dropped and the squadron was redesignated the 45th Fighter Squadron. Over the next two years, the squadron would be involved primarily with combat training, and the job of air defense would take on a secondary role. The 45th was sent to the Central Pacific in 1943 for combat operations against Japanese forces. Then, on 6 April 1944, the squadron returned to Mokuleia Field, Hawaii, and began training for very-long-range (VLR) bomber escort missions. By this time, the pilots in the squadron were flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Later in the year they would acquire the longer range North American P-51 Mustangs. In January 1945, the 45th was ordered into combat, along with the other assigned squadrons in the 15th group. It left Hawaii for Saipan in the Marianas Islands, staying there until the Marines on Iwo Jima could secure a landing strip. The first squadron to arrive at Iwo Jima was the 47th Fighter Squadron on the morning of 6 March, with the 45th landing the next day. They supported Marine ground units by bombing and strafing cave entrances, trenches, troop concentrations, and storage areas. Before the month was over, the 45th began strikes against enemy airfields, shipping and military installations in the Bonin Islands. Flying its first VLR mission to Japan on 7 April 1945, the 45th provided fighter escort for the Boeing B-29 Superfortresses that attacked the Nakajima aircraft plant near Tokyo. In late April and early May that year, the 45th struck airfields on the Japanese home island of Kyushu to hold back the enemy's Kamikaze attacks against the American invasion force on Okinawa. The squadron also attacked enemy troop trains, small factories, gun positions, and hangars in the Bonin Islands and Japan. During the summer of 1945, the 45th was assigned to the Twentieth Air Force and continued its fighter sweeps against Japanese airfields and other tactical targets. It continued to fly long-range B-29 escort missions to Japanese cities until the end of the war. After the Japanese surrender, the squadron remained on Iwo Jima until 25 November 1945, when it transferred to Bellows Field, Hawaii. On 8 February 1946, the squadron moved to Wheeler Field, where it stayed until inactivated on 15 October 1946. =Air Defense Command= The squadron was redesignated the 45th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and was activated on 1 November 1952 at Suffolk County Air Force Base, New York and assigned to the 4709th Defense Wing of the Air Defense Command (ADC). It assumed the mission, personnel and North American F-86 Sabres of the 118th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which had been called to active duty for the Korean War.Cornett & Johnson, p. 122 The 118th was returned to the control of the Connecticut Air National Guard. In February 1953 Air Defense Command reorganized its dispersed fighter bases and the 45th was assigned to the 519th Air Defense Group, which was activated to control operational and support elements at Suffolk County.Cornett & Johnson, p.. 81 Its primary mission was in defending the American east coast from any Soviet threats. =North Africa= The squadron had a short ADC commitment, however, as they were transferred to United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) in French Morocco, North Africa. On 25 May 1953, the squadron left Suffolk County and flew all their aircraft over to Sidi Slimane Air Base, which was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base. Making stops along the way, the squadron arrived at Sidi Slimane on 28 May. The base was shared with rotating bomber groups that flew Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium-range bombers. Now part of the Seventeenth Air Force, the squadron was attached to the Air Defense Division, Provisional on 8 June 1953. A short time later, on 18 September 1953, they were assigned to the 316th Air Division. The primary mission of the 45th at Sidi Slimane was flying air defense patrols off the coast of Morocco and around the Atlas mountains to the east. Pilots also took turns on alert duty in case an unidentified aircraft was spotted on radar coming towards French Morocco. The squadron was redesignated 45th Fighter-Day Squadron on 8 October 1954. The pilots in the 45th continued to fly the F-86F Sabre until March 1956, when they received new North American F-100C Super Sabres. Defense patrols were still carried out by the 45th until the end of December 1957. On 8 January 1958, the squadron was inactivated again. =Tactical Air Command= On 17 April 1962, the squadron was redesignated 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron. It organized on 8 May at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, a former Strategic Air Command base now under Tactical Air Command (TAC), and was assigned to the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing. It was transferred to the 15th Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill on 1 July 1962. The 45th flew Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks for two years while at MacDill, then in 1964 received McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs. The mission of the squadron was conducting combat crew training, and they took part in many exercises, flight operations, and readiness tests. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the squadron temporarily reorganized as a combat-capable unit ready to strike Cuba if necessary. After the crisis was over, the squadron returned to its training mission. In 1965, the 45th was sent from their home base at MacDill to Southeast Asia. Under the command of Colonel William A. Alden, they arrived at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand on 4 April. The 45th was the first F-4 Phantom II unit to arrive in Southeast Asia. It achieved another first a little over three months later, when on 10 July 1965, two F-4C Phantoms from the 45th shot down two North Vietnamese MiG-17s. This was the first United States Air Force aerial victory of the Vietnam War. Captain Thomas Roberts was the pilot of one of the F-4s, and Captain Ronald Anderson was his backseat pilot systems officer (PSO). Captain Kenneth Holcombe with Captain Arthur Clark as PSO piloted the other F-4. The 45th left Ubon on 10 August 1965, and returned to MacDill. For the next five years they would serve as a replacement training unit for F-4 pilots headed to SEA. On 1 October 1970, the 15th Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated and the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, which was formerly at Hamilton Air Force Base in California, took its place at MacDill. The 45th was assigned to the 1st Wing and continued its role as a training unit until it was inactivated on 1 July 1971. =Air Force Reserve= On 1 October 1973, the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron was reactivated and assigned to the Air Force Reserve's (AFRES) 434th Tactical Fighter Wing at Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana. For the next eight years they would fly the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, an upgraded version of the Cessna T-37 Tweet jet trainer with more performance and armament capabilities. In 1981 the squadron transitioned to the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, affectionately called the \\"Warthog\\" by those who flew it. On 1 July 1987, the squadron was reassigned to the 930th Tactical Fighter Group at Grissom, which became the 930th Operations Group. As an Air Force Reserve unit, the 940 TFG still flew the A-10. On 1 February 1992, the squadron was redesignated 45th Fighter Squadron. Known as the \\"Hoosier Hogs,\\" the pilots of the 45th flew their missions up until September 1994. The squadron was inactivated on 1 October 1994. On 1 November 2009, the unit was reactivated as an Air Force Reserve Command A-10 unit at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The 45th is an associate of the regular 355th Fighter Wing at Davis–Monthan, where it trains A-10 pilots.

Book  Zdarzenie w Emilcinie (Incident in Emilcin) } Emilcin Abduction was a supposed alien abduction of farmer, Jan Wolski in May 1978. There was little media attention at the time. A monument was subsequently erected in Emilcin, Poland, at the site where the abduction is said to have taken place.  Background  Jan Wolski (; 29 May 1907 – 8 January 1990) was out driving a horse-drawn cart early on 10 May 1978 when he says he was jumped by two \\"short, green-faced humanoid entities\\" about tall. The two beings jumped onto Wolski's cart and, according to Wolski, sat next to him and started to speak in a strange language. Originally he had mistaken them for foreigners because of their \\"slanted eyes and prominent cheekbones.\\" Wolski drove his cart, with the two beings aboard, to a clearing where he says a large object was hovering. = The craft = According to Wolski, a purely white unidentified flying object, about – in height and \\"as long as a bus,\\" hovered in the air at an altitude of about . There were no notable external features of the craft (i.e. lights, joints, etc.). Wolski mentioned that there were four objects on the craft made of a black material that appeared to be drill-like in appearance, which generated a humming sound. An elevator-like platform attached to the hovering craft descended to the ground. (Artist's Rendition 1 2) Wolski then claims that he was taken aboard the ship with two additional entities he met near the flying object. He was then gestured to \\"undress\\" (take off his clothes). There were about eight or ten benches situated around the craft, each the size for one person to sit in. There were some rooks in front of the door which was moving its legs and wings but seemed to be immobilized. Wolski claims that he was then examined with a tool that resembled two dishes or \\"saucers.\\" After this, he was ordered to redress, and it was then that he noticed there were no lights or windows on the craft, only the daylight coming through the craft's door. Entities ate and offered him something like icicles but he refused. The craft's interior was described as black with a greyish tint, similar to that of the creatures' outfits.  Aftermath  Afterwards, Wolski returned home to his family and notified them of what had just happened, urging them to come see the floating craft. He notified his sons who called to other neighbours, and together they went to investigate the site. The grass where the craft had been had signs of usage in it, being \\"trodden down covered with dew and paths coming in all directions.\\" Wolski returned home, leaving the rest of the neighbours and family at the site. Wolski's sons claim that there were footprints left behind by the beings, though they did not detail whether the footprints were larger or smaller than their own. A six-year-old boy claims to have witnessed a bus-like craft hover over a barn, then climb high into the sky and vanish. Wolski explained these memories in an interview with Henryk Pomorski and Krystyna Adamczyk in July 1978, two months following the incident.

It features Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Jay Hernandez, Michael Ealy, Tip \\"T.I.\\" Harris, Chris Brown, Hayden Christensen and Zoe Saldana. The film was released on August 27, 2010. The film follows a group of professional bank robbers (Ealy, Brown, Christensen, Walker and Elba) who specialize in spectacular robberies, as they are pulled into one last job by a recently paroled cohort (T.I.) only to be pitted against a hard-boiled detective (Dillon) and his partner (Hernandez) who interrupt their heist. Plot Detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher investigate a daring heist by a group of well- organized bank robbers. The crew, led by Gordon Cozier, consists of John, A.J., and brothers Jake and Jesse Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost, who was caught during a previous robbery five years before. In his absence, Jake began a relationship with Ghost's former girlfriend Lilly, who has accepted his marriage proposal. After Ghost is released from prison, he meets up with the crew to plan a heist, in which it is discovered that two trucks will travel together, but that all the money is kept in the lead truck, which holds $12 million. The crew, dressed as construction workers, hide out underground, while Ghost poses as a police officer, so he can keep an eye out for the trucks. Meanwhile, in order to cover themselves in case Ghost is setting them up, John heads to the top of a nearby garage to take out Ghost with a sniper rifle in case things go wrong. The crew plan to dentonate the blast when the armored trucks drive overhead, causing the trucks to fall underground. However, a bicyclist causes the lead driver to stop short and the explosives are detonated too early. The lead driver radios the police, while armed guards pile out of the rear truck. A gunfight ensues between the robbers in the crater and the guards on the street, until John commandeers the rear truck and rams the lead truck into the crater where the crew cut into it. John and the other robbers pack the cash into bags, and flee by heading down a variety of different tunnels, with the plan of connecting into various subway lines to make their escape. Welles and Hatcher show up on the scene, and, after learning of the robbers' escape through the sewer system, remember a map of the city subway system from the Russian gang hideout, and deduce that they must be escaping through the stations marked on the map where the sewers intersect the subway. They rush to the nearest station, where they find Jesse, and a chase ensues, during which Jesse hides his bag of money and is cornered, and is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Jesse escapes, while Welles stops to aid his partner, who dies from his wound. Jesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room, and admits to the shooting of Hatcher. It is now revealed that Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former accomplices in exchange for half of the heist's take. Ghost gives the Russians the hotel room number, then escapes out the bathroom window, just before the Russians storm the room and attempt to kill the crew. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight, but the rest of the crew is able to kill the Russians and flee the building before the police arrive. Jake and Jesse return home where, to their horror, Jake finds Lilly's corpse, and Jesse finds the safe where they kept their secret stash of money opened and cleaned out. The police surround their bar, and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside, killing them. Gordon and John separate to make their escape, but realize that Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott, a well-connected fence. Ghost sneaks onto Scott's private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive, and a three-way Mexican standoff results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish Gordon off, John arrives and shoots him dead. John recognizes Welles as the same cop, who was with the little girl. John and Gordon refuse to kill Welles. John and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordon's sister Naomi in tow. A gravely-wounded Welles manages to call 911 for help on his cell phone. The film ends without revealing whether either Gordon or Welles survive their injuries.  Cast  Reception =Critical reception= Takers received mixed reviews from critics.

It is also called magwae and while it was originally a male garment, it is now considered a unisex article of clothing. The magoja was originally a Manchu style of clothing, but was introduced after Heungseon Daewongun, father of King Gojong, returned from political exile in Manchuria in 1887. The magoja is derived from the magwae that he wore at that time to protect against the cold weather of the region. Due to its warmth and the fact that it's easy to wear, the magoja's popularity spread throughout Korea. It is also called \\"deot jeogori\\" (literally \\"an outer jeogori\\"). The magoja does not have git (깃, a band of fabric that trims the collar) or goreum (고름, coat strings), unlike the jeogori and durumagi (overcoat). The men's magoja has seop (섶, overlapped column on the front) and its length is longer than women's magoja, so that both sides are open at the bottom. Most magoja are made of silk and are adorned with one or two buttons which are usually made from amber. In a male magoja, buttons are attached to the right side, while on women's magoja they are attached to the left. At first, women wore the magoja for style rather than comfort and it was particularly popular among the Kaeseong people. The color for these silk women's magojas tend to be neutral in order to harmonize with other garments such as the jeogori and chima (a volumous skirt), the two main parts of the female hanbok. In spring and autumn, a pastel tone is used for the women's magoja so that wearers can wear it over a jeogori for style. As for men's magoja worn during spring and summer, jade, green, gray, dark grey are used.

It is a herb with three linear to thread-like leaves and usually two to seven white flowers with a purple or greenish nectary band. Description Wurmbea dioica is a herb that typically grows to a height of and has three linear to thread-like or tapering leaves long and wide with a sheathing base. Individual plants may have male- only, female-only or both male and female flowers and sometimes bisexual flowers. There are up to fifteen flowers on each plant, each with six elliptic white tepals long. Each tepal has a purple to greenish or white nectary band one-quarter to half the length from its base. The stamens are half to two- thirds as long as the tepals and the anthers are about long and red or purple. Flowering occurs mainly from June to November and the fruit is a capsule long. Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Anguillaria dioica and published the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 1877, Ferdinand von Mueller changed the name to Wurmbea dioica in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The names of three subspecies are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Wurmbea dioica subsp. alba T.D.Macfarl. has all-white tepals; * Wurmbea dioica subsp. brevifolia R.J.Bates is distinguished by its short, egg- shaped upper leaf and pink-edged tepals; * Wurmbea dioica (R.Br.)

D. P. Davies, (18 January 1897 - 7 July 1969) was a Welsh Presbyterian minister and writer on theological topics. After becoming the first Welsh student to obtain a Bachelor of Divinity degree from the University of Oxford, he turned down an offer to become a theology tutor at Oxford, along with a college fellowship, preferring to become a Presbyterian minister. He wrote various theological works and was regarded as an excellent scholar as well as a powerful preacher. Life Davies was the only son of a Presbyterian minister, Isaac Davies, and his wife. He was born in Glyn Ceiriog, Denbighshire, in north Wales but moved with his parents to Rhyd Ddu in Snowdonia, Bryn-rhos and Bangor, Caernarfonshire. Davies studied at the county school in Caernarfon and at the Friars School, Bangor before winning a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford. During the First World War, he was a conscientious objector and carried out agricultural work on the Llyn Peninsula, preaching in Pwllheli during this time. When the war was over, he returned to Oxford, obtaining second class Honour Moderations in Literae Humaniores and a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in theology. After further study, he obtained a Bachelor of Divinity degree, becoming the first Welsh non-conformist to be awarded the degree by the University of Oxford. He refused the offer of a fellowship and appointment as a tutor in theology at the university, since the terms of appointment included his becoming a member of the Church of England and Davies had by this time decided to become a Presbyterian minister. Davies was regarded as a powerful preacher, as well as an excellent scholar. He was ordained in 1923 and ministered in London until 1926, before moving to Cardiff, where he served until 1928. In that year he was appointed Professor of the History of Religions and the Philosophy of Religion at the United Theological College Aberystwyth. His publications included works on religious topics: ' (1932), ' (1934), and a book on the Epistle to the Ephesians (1933). He resigned from the Theological College in 1933, after events showed that he was suffering from a disturbance of mind: he had a split personality for the rest of his life. He moved around, living in Neath and Machynlleth and in other places as a writer for the Welsh language newspaper Y Cymro. During this time, he wrote various essays and poems and began to call himself \\"W. D. P. Davies\\", saying that the \\"P\\" stood for \\"sinner\\" (), but it may have derived from his wife Margaret's maiden name (Palmer). He spent a few months in charge of the churches in Llangadfan, Montgomeryshire but this was not a success. He was given the opportunity to recover by the Ithon Road Presbyterian Church in Llandrindod Wells, where he died on 7 July 1969.

Background  Xiao Fu was born in 732, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He was from a prominent clan that descended from the imperial house of Liang Dynasty, and his grandfather Xiao Song was a chancellor during Emperor Xuanzong's reign. His father was Xiao Song's son Xiao Heng (蕭衡), and his mother was Princess Xinchang, a daughter of Emperor Xuanzong,New Book of Tang, vol. 83. making him a grandson of Emperor Xuanzong as well. As the Xiao clan was greatly honored, his brothers and cousins all competed having the best clothes, horses, and decorations, while Xiao Fu dressed plainly. He also was often studying in his room, alone, and his friends were all writers or Confucian scholars.Old Book of Tang, vol. 125. His uncle Xiao Hua, who was a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, was impressed by him, and often stated, \\"This child will surely glorify this clan.\\"New Book of Tang, vol. 101 . Due to his being the son of a princess, he was, early in his career, made a Gongmenlang (宮門郎), in charge of the office of the palace gates (宮門局, Gongmenju). He was later made the director of transportation for the crown prince (太子僕, Taizi Pu).However, as it is not clear during the reign of which emperor he was made the director of transportation for the crown prince, it is not clear which crown prince he served under.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  During the Guangde era (763-764) of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, there was a span of poor harvests, causing food prices to rise. With the Xiao clan being a large one and needing funds to pay for food, the clan considered selling an ancestral property in Zhaoying County (昭應, near the capital Chang'an). The chancellor Wang Jin heard that the property contained beautiful trees and springs and wanted the property, and thus sent his brother Wang Hong (王紘) to meet Xiao Fu. Wang Hong stated to Xiao, \\"You, sir, have talent that shall land you greater offices. If you offer your manor to my brother, he will surely help you achieve that.\\" Xiao Fu responded, \\"I, an imperial servant, am selling this ancestral property because of poverty, to aid the widows and young of the clan. If I trade it for a high position such that I let my clan folks be frozen or starved, I would not be doing what even a commoner should be doing.\\" Wang Jin was angered by these remarks and removed Xiao from his office, and he spent the next several years at home. Despite this, he was not distressed. He later returned to government service and became a low-level official at the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). Yet later, he served as the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu).  During Emperor Dezong's reign  = Prior to chancellorship = In 779, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Xiao Fu was made the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) as well as the prefect of Hunan's capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan). He later served as the prefect of Tong Prefecture (同州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). At that time, there was a famine in the prefecture, and he opened the food storages that were overseen by the governor of Jingzhao Circuit (京兆, i.e., the Chang'an region) to give to the people, without approval from his superiors. As a result, he was punished by being reduced in rank. When his friends visited him to console him, he remarked, \\"I benefited others. Is it not right I suffer a minor punishment?\\" He was soon made the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang). In 783, with Li Xilie the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) rebelling against imperial rule, Emperor Dezong, believing that the armies sent against Li Xilie needed a supreme commander to coordinate their actions, commissioned his son Li Yi (李誼) the Prince of PuLi Yi was actually Emperor Dezong's nephew — the son of Emperor Dezong's brother Li Miao (李邈), but was adopted by Emperor Dezong at the directions of Emperor Dezong. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 150 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. to be the supreme commander of the forces against Huaixi, and he gave Xiao the honorary title of minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu), to serve as the secretary general for Li Yi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. However, before Li Yi could depart Chang'an, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at Chang'an to await deployment to the east against Li Xilie or other warlords, mutinied after they were not awarded as they believed they deserved. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Many officials followed him there, including Xiao. The Jingyuan soldiers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu initially claimed that he was set to welcome Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an, but soon was planning to take over as emperor. Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong, finding Fengtian to be too small of a city for him and his followers, wanted to head for Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then governed by the former chancellor Zhang Yi but formerly under Zhu's control. When Xiao heard that Emperor Dezong was intended to head to Fengxiang, he immediately met with Emperor Dezong and warned against it: Emperor Dezong responded that he had already decided to head to Fengxiang, but on Xiao's objection will remain at Fengtian for one more day. The next day, news arrived that Zhu's former subordinate Li Chulin (李楚琳) had mutinied, killed Zhang, and taken over Fengxiang. Soon thereafter, Xiao, was made the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Liu Congyi and Jiang Gongfu. = During chancellorship = Zhu Ci, who claimed the title of emperor of his new state of Qin, was soon putting Fengtian under siege, although Fengtian was saved by the major Tang general Li Huaiguang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. Meanwhile, Xiao earnestly sought reform of Emperor Dezong's administration at Fengtian. He suggested that Emperor Dezong not give eunuchs authorities and recall the eunuchs who were serving as army monitors — a suggestion that greatly displeased Emperor Dezong. Despite Emperor Dezong's displeasure, Xiao responded: On one occasion, when Xiao and Lu met Emperor Dezong together, Lu was merely flattering Emperor Dezong and following everything that Emperor Dezong said, and Xiao stated, \\"Lu Qi's words are wrongful.\\" This surprised Emperor Dezong, and after the meeting was over, he told his attendants, \\"Xiao Fu views me lightly.\\" In spring 784, while he was still at Fengtian, he commissioned Xiao Fu to be the examiner of the southern circuits of the empire and sent him out on a mission to survey those circuits, in order to get Xiao away from him. When Liu Congyi and many other officials asked that Xiao be kept at the imperial government, Emperor Dezong's suspicions were further aroused that Xiao had induced these other officials into speaking on his behalf, although he did not investigate the matter further. By late 784, the general Li Sheng had destroyed Zhu's regime, allowing Emperor Dezong to return to Chang'an. Xiao had also returned from his mission, and he suggested to Emperor Dezong that Chen Shaoyou (陳少遊), the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), who had submitted to Li Xilie during the time Emperor Dezong was away from Chang'an, be replaced by Wei Gao — a Fengxiang officer who had resisted Li Chulin. Emperor Dezong agreed. However, Xiao was soon surprised when Liu Congyi stated to him, \\"Ma Qinxu [(馬欽緒, an eunuch who served as imperial messenger)] informed me that the Emperor wanted me to discuss with you, Lord, your proposal, and then carry it out without informing Li Mian and Lu Han [(two other chancellors who served with Xiao and Liu)]. Can you tell me what your proposal was?\\" Xiao, finding it inappropriate that Emperor Dezong was keeping secrets away from Li Mian and Lu, as fellow chancellors, stated:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. When Liu informed Emperor Dezong about this, Emperor Dezong was displeased. Xiao, seeing that he had lost the emperor's favor, offered to resign. In winter 784, Emperor Dezong removed him from his chancellor position and made him a member of the staff of the Crown Prince Li Song. = After chancellorship = In 787, a scandal involving Princess Gao — the daughter of Emperor Suzong (and thus aunt to Emperor Dezong) and the widow of Xiao Fu's cousin Xiao Sheng (蕭升), whose daughter was the wife and crown prince to Li Song — unfolded, as she was found to have had a large number of young lovers, and she was further accused of using witchcraft. The scandal nearly caused Li Song to be removed from his crown prince position and forced him to divorce Crown Princess Xiao, and the scandal also enveloped the Xiao household.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. Emperor Dezong, still resentful of Xiao Fu, let him keep his rank but exiled him to Rao Prefecture (饒州, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi). It was said, though, that Xiao was not distressed and made no complaints. He died in 788, while still at Rao Prefecture. His grandson Xiao Zhi later served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Yizong.

In 1955, two onion traders, Sam Siegel and Vincent Kosuga, cornered the onion futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The resulting regulatory actions led to the passing of the act on August 28, 1958. , it remains in effect. History =Onion trading= Onion futures trading began on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the mid-1940s as an attempt to replace the income lost when the butter futures contract ceased. By the mid-1950s, onions futures contracts were the most traded product on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 1955, they accounted for 20% of its trades. =Market manipulation= In the fall of 1955, Siegel and Kosuga bought enough onions and onion futures so that they controlled 98% of the available onions in Chicago. Millions of pounds (thousands of tonnes) of onions were shipped to Chicago to cover their purchases. By late 1955, they had stored of onions in Chicago. They soon changed course and convinced onion growers to begin purchasing their inventory by threatening to flood the market with onions if they did not. Siegel and Kosuga told the growers that they would hold the rest of their inventory in order to support the price of onions. As the growers began buying onions, Siegel and Kosuga accumulated short positions on a large amount of onion contracts. They also arranged to have their stores of onions reconditioned because they had started to spoil. They shipped them outside of Chicago to have them cleaned and then repackaged and re-shipped back to Chicago. The \\"new\\" shipments of onions caused many futures traders to think that there was an excess of onions and further drove down onion prices in Chicago. By the end of the onion season in March 1956, Siegel and Kosuga had flooded the markets with their onions and driven the price of of onions down to 10 cents a bag. In August 1955, the same quantity of onions had been priced at $2.75 a bag. So many onions were shipped to Chicago in order to depress prices that there were onion shortages in other parts of the United States. Siegel and Kosuga made millions of dollars on the transaction due to their short position on onion futures. At one point, however, of onions were selling in Chicago for less than the bags that held them. This drove many onion farmers into bankruptcy. A public outcry ensued among onion farmers who were left with large amounts of worthless inventory. Many of the farmers had to pay to dispose of the large amounts of onions that they had purchased and grown. =Regulatory action= In the aftermath of the crash, many commentators characterized Kosuga's actions as unprincipled gambling. The abrupt change in prices gained the attention of the Commodity Exchange Authority. Soon they launched an investigation and the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture and House Committee on Agriculture held hearings on the matter. During the hearings, the Commodity Exchange Authority stated that it was the perishable nature of onion which made them vulnerable to price swings. Then-congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan sponsored a bill, known as the Onion Futures Act, which banned futures trading in onions. The bill was unpopular among traders, some of whom argued that onion shortages were not a crucial issue since they were used as a condiment rather than a staple food. The president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, E. B. Harris, lobbied hard against the bill. Harris described it as \\"burning down the barn to find a suspected rat\\". The measure was passed, however, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill in August 1958.. Thus, onions were excluded from the definition of \\"commodity\\" in the Commodity Exchange Act. Impact =Effect on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange= After the ban was passed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the ban unfairly restricted trade. After a federal judge ruled against them, they declined to appeal to the Supreme Court and the ban stood. The loss of a lucrative trading product was devastating to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The other products that were traded, including futures contracts on eggs, turkeys, and potatoes, were not large enough to support the exchange. This led to the emergence of new leadership who pioneered a different strategy, expanding the exchange's traded products to include futures contracts on pork bellies and frozen concentrate orange juice. These proved to be popular products and eventually restored lost popularity to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. =Effect on price volatility= The ban has provided academics with a unique opportunity to study the effect of an active futures market on commodity prices. Experts have been divided on the effect that onion futures trading has on the volatility of onion prices. Holbrook Working published a study in 1960 which argued that price volatility declined after the futures market for onions was introduced in the 1940s.Working, Holbrook (1960-02). \\"Price Effects of Futures Trading.\\" Reprinted from Food Research Institute Studies, Vol. 1, No. 1, February 1960, in Selected Writings of Holbrook Working, Anne E. Peck, ed., Chicago Board of Trade, 1977. pp. 45–71. Working cited this study as proof of the efficient-market hypothesis. In 1963, this theory was lent more support by a study published by Roger Gray. Gray, an expert in agricultural futures markets and professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University, concluded that onion price volatility increased after the Onion Futures Act was passed.\\"Onion Revisited.\\" Gray, Roger. Journal of Farm Economics,. Vol. 45, No. 2, May 1963. Aaron C. Johnson published a study in 1973 that contradicted Gray's findings. He found that onion price volatility in the 1960s was the lowest of any decade on record.Johnson, Aaron C. \\"Effects of Futures Trading on Price Performance in the Cash Onion Market, 1930–1968,\\" (excerpted from USDA, ERS, Technical Bulletin No. 1470, February 1973), in Peck (1977a), pp. 329–336. Financial journalist Justin Fox noted that even though onion prices in the 1960s might have been more stable due to better weather or advances in transportation methods: \\"There was certainly no clear evidence from the onion fields to support the presumption that speculative markets got prices right.\\" In the 2000s, onion prices were significantly more volatile than corn or oil prices. This volatility led the son of a farmer who initially lobbied for the ban to advocate a return to onion futures trading.

India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010. The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’. ‘Free education’ means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. ‘Compulsory education’ casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article 21A of the Constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act.17. History Present Act has its history in the drafting of the Indian constitution at the time of Independence but is more specifically to the Constitutional Amendment of 2002 that included the Article 21A in the Indian constitution making Education a fundamental Right. This amendment, however, specified the need for a legislation to describe the mode of implementation of the same which necessitated the drafting of a separate Education Bill. It is the 86th amendment in the Indian Constitution. A rough draft of the bill was prepared in year 2005AD. It caused considerable controversy due to its mandatory provision to provide 25% reservation for disadvantaged children in private schools. The sub-committee of the Central Advisory Board of Education which prepared the draft Bill held this provision as a significant prerequisite for creating a democratic and egalitarian society. Indian Law commission had initially proposed 50% reservation for disadvantaged students in private schools. On 7 May 2014, The Supreme Court of India ruled that Right to Education Act is not applicable to Minority institutions.Minority institutions are exempted from Right to Education Act  Passage  The bill was approved by the cabinet on 2 July 2009. Rajya Sabha passed the bill on 20 July 2009 and the Lok Sabha on 4 August 2009. It received Presidential assent and was notified as law on 26 August 2009 as The Children's Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act. The law came into effect in the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir from 1 April 2010, the first time in the history of India a law was brought into force by a speech by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In his speech, Dr. Singh stated, \\"We are committed to ensuring that all children, irrespective of gender and social category, have access to education. An education that enables them to acquire the skills, knowledge, values and attitudes necessary to become responsible and active citizens of India.\\" It now came into act in Kashmir after it turned into a Union Territory of India in 2019. The RTE Act provides for the right of children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary education in a neighbourhood school. It clarifies that ‘compulsory education’ means obligation of the appropriate government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. ‘Free’ means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. It makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age appropriate class. It specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate Governments, local authority and parents in providing free and compulsory education, and sharing of financial and other responsibilities between the Central and State Governments. It lays down the norms and standards relating inter alia to pupil teacher ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure, school-working days, teacher-working hours. It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the specified pupil teacher ratio is maintained for each school, rather than just as an average for the State or District or Block, thus ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in teacher postings. It also provides for prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than decennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and parliament, and disaster relief. It provides for appointment of appropriately trained teachers, i.e. teachers with the requisite entry and academic qualifications. It prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental harassment; (b) screening procedures for admission of children; (c) capitation fee; (d) private tuition by teachers and (e) running of schools without recognition. It provides for development of curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the Constitution, and which would ensure the all-round development of the child, building on the child's knowledge, potentiality and talent and making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety through a system of child friendly and child centered learning.  Highlights  The Act makes education a fundamental right of every child between the ages of 6 and 14 and specifies minimum norms in elementary schools. It requires all private schools(except the minority institutions) to reserve 25% of seats for the poor and other categories of children (to be reimbursed by the state as part of the public-private partnership plan). Children are admitted in to private schools based on caste-based reservations. See Page 9 and Point no 4 of This Document. It also prohibits all unrecognised schools from practice, and makes provisions for no donation or capitation fees and no interview of the child or parent for admission. The Act also provides that no child shall be held back, expelled, or required to pass a board examination until the completion of elementary education. There is also a provision for special training of school drop-outs to bring them up to par with students of the same age. The RTE act requires surveys that will monitor all neighbourhoods, identify children requiring education, and set up facilities for providing it. The World Bank education specialist for India, Sam Carlson, has observed: : The RTE Act is the first legislation in the world that puts the responsibility of ensuring enrolment, attendance and completion on the Government. It is the parents' responsibility to send the children to schools in the US and other countries. name=prayatna The Right to Education of persons with disabilities until 18 years of age is laid down under a separate legislation- the Persons with Disabilities Act. A number of other provisions regarding improvement of school infrastructure, teacher-student ratio and faculty are made in the Act. Implementation and funding Education in the Indian constitution is a concurrent issue and both centre and states can legislate on the issue. The Act lays down specific responsibilities for the centre, state and local bodies for its implementation. The states have been clamouring that they lack financial capacity to deliver education of appropriate standard in all the schools needed for universal education. Thus it is clear that the central government (which collects most of the revenue) will be required to subsidise the states. A committee set up to study the funds requirement and funding initially estimated that Rs 1710 billion or 1.71 trillion (US$38.2 billion) across five years was required to implement the Act, and in April 2010 the central government agreed to sharing the funding for implementing the law in the ratio of 65 to 35 between the centre and the states, and a ratio of 90 to 10 for the north-eastern states. However, in mid 2010, this figure was upgraded to Rs. 2310 billion, and the center agreed to raise its share to 68%. There is some confusion on this, with other media reports stating that the centre's share of the implementation expenses would now be 70%. At that rate, most states may not need to increase their education budgets substantially. A critical development in 2011 has been the decision taken in principle to extend the right to education till Class X (age 16) and into the preschool age range. The CABE committee is in the process of looking into the implications of making these changes. Advisory Council on Implementation The Ministry of HRD set up a high-level, 14-member National Advisory Council (NAC) for implementation of the Act. The members include * Kiran Karnik, former president of NASSCOM * Krishna Kumar, former director of the NCERT * Mrinal Miri, former vice-chancellor of North-East Hill University * Yogendra Yadav – social scientist. India *Sajit Krishnan Kutty Secretary of The Educators Assisting Children's Hopes (TEACH)India. * Annie Namala, an activist and head of Centre for Social Equity and Inclusion *Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, vice-president of Muslim Education Society, Kerala. Status of implementation A report on the status of implementation of the Act was released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on the one-year anniversary of the Act, and again till 2015. The report admits that 1.7 million children in the age group 6-14 remain out of school and there's a shortage of 508,000 teachers country-wide. A shadow report by the RTE Forum, representing the leading education networks in the country led by Ambarish Rai (a prominent activist), however, challenging the findings pointing out that several key legal commitments are falling behind schedule. The Supreme Court of India has also intervened to demand implementation of the Act in the Northeast. It has also provided the legal basis for ensuring pay parity between teachers in government and government aided schools Haryana Government has assigned the duties and responsibilities to Block Elementary Education Officers–cum–Block Resource Coordinators (BEEOs-cum-BRCs) for effective implementation and continuous monitoring of implementation of Right to Education Act in the State.RTE Implementation http://iharnews.com/index.php/education/295-beeo-right-to-education-act- haryana Precedents It has been pointed out that the RTE act is not new. Universal adult franchise in the act was opposed since most of the population was illiterate. Article 45 in the Constitution of India was set up as an act: :The state shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. As that deadline was about to be passed many decades ago, the education minister at the time, M C Chagla, memorably said: :Our Constitution fathers did not intend that we just set up hovels, put students there, give untrained teachers, give them bad textbooks, no playgrounds, and say, we have complied with Article 45 and primary education is expanding... They meant that real education should be given to our children between the ages of 6 and 14 – M.C. Chagla, 1964http://www.indg.in/primary- education/policiesandschemes/rte_ssa_final_report.pdf In the 1990s, the World Bank funded a number of measures to set up schools within easy reach of rural communities. This effort was consolidated in the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan model in the 1990s. RTE takes the process further, and makes the enrolment of children in schools a state prerogative. Criticism The act has been criticised for being hastily drafted, not consulting many groups active in education, not considering the quality of education, infringing on the rights of private and religious minority schools to administer their system, and for excluding children under six years of age. Many of the ideas are seen as continuing the policies of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan of the 2000s, and the World Bank funded District Primary Education Programme DPEP of the '90s, both of which, while having set up a number of schools in rural areas, have been criticised for being ineffective and corruption-ridden. The quality of education provided by the government school system is not good. While it remains the largest provider of elementary education in the country, forming 80% of all recognised schools, it suffers from shortage of teachers and infrastructural gaps. Several habitations lack schools altogether. There are also frequent allegations of government schools being riddled with absenteeism and mismanagement and of appointments made on political convenience. Despite the allure of free lunch in the government schools, many parents send their children to private schools. Average schoolteacher salaries in private rural schools in some States (about Rs. 4,000 per month) are considerably lower than those in government schools. As a result, the proponents of low-cost private schools critique the government schools as being poor value for money. Children attending the private schools are seen to be at an advantage, forming a discrimination against the weakest sections who are forced to go to government schools. Furthermore, the system has been criticised as catering to the rural elites who are able to afford school fees in a country where a large number of families live in absolute poverty. The act has been criticised as discriminatory for not addressing these issues. Well-known educationist Anil Sadgopal said of the hurriedly drafted act: :It is a fraud on our children. It gives neither free education nor compulsory education. In fact, it only legitimises the present multi-layered, inferior quality school education system where discrimination shall continue to prevail. Entrepreneur Gurcharan Das noted that 54% of urban children attend private schools, and this rate is growing at 3% per year. \\"Even the poor children are abandoning the government schools. They are leaving because the teachers are not showing up.\\" However, other researchers have countered the argument by saying that the evidence for higher standard of quality in private schools often disappears when other factors (like family income and parental literacy) are accounted for. =Public-private partnership= To address these quality issues, the Act has provisions for compensating private schools for admission of children under the 25% quota which has been compared to school vouchers, whereby parents may \\"send\\" their children in any school, private or public. This measure, along with the increase in PPP (Public Private Partnership) has been viewed by some organisations such as the All-India Forum for Right to Education (AIF-RTE), as the state abdicating its \\"constitutional obligation towards providing elementary education\\". =Infringement on private schools= The Society for Un-aided Private Schools, Rajasthan (in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 95 of 2010) and as many as 31 others petitioned the Supreme Court of India claiming that the act violates the constitutional right of private managements to run their institutions without governmental interference. The parties claimed that providing 25 percent reservation for disadvantaged children in government and private unaided schools is \\"unconstitutional.\\" Forcing unaided schools to admit 25% disadvantaged students has also been criticized on the grounds that the government has partly transferred its constitutional obligation to provide free and compulsory elementary education to children on “non-state actors,” like private schools, while collecting a 2% cess on the total tax payable for primary education. On 12 April 2012, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered its judgement by a majority of 2–1. Chief Justice SH Kapadia and Justice Swatanter Kumar held that providing such reservation is not unconstitutional, but stated that the Act will not be applicable to private minority schools and boarding schools. However, Justice K. S. Panicker Radhakrishnan dissented with the majority view and held that the Act cannot apply to both minority and non-minority private schools that do not receive aid from the government. In September 2012, the Supreme Court subsequently declined a review petition on the Act. In May 2016, the Chetpet-based CBSE school Maharishi Vidya Mandir became embroiled in a scandal over its circumvention of the 25% quota rule.Maharishi Vidya Mandir Protest Site During its admissions cycle, the school told economically weaker parents \\"the RTE does not exist,\\" and, \\"we do not take these [government RTE] applications.\\" The senior principal also informed the Tamil Nadu Regional Director of the CBSE that he intended to \\"reject applicants without an email address,\\" thereby excluding technically illiterate parents from seeking admissions. In addition, school officials falsified the distance figures of several poorer candidates in attempts to disqualify them from availing of the scheme. = Barrier for orphans = The Act provides for admission of children without any certification. However, several states have continued pre-existing procedures insisting that children produce income and caste certificates, BPL cards and birth certificates. Orphan children are often unable to produce such documents, even though they are willing to do so. As a result, schools are not admitting them, as they require the documents as a condition to admission.

It is native to North America. The Nootka lupine grows to 60 cm tall. Late in the 18th century it was first introduced to Europe.Magnusson, B. (2006): NOBANIS – Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet – Lupinus nootkatensis. – From: Online Database of the North European and Baltic Network on Invasive Alien Species – NOBANIS www.nobanis.org, Date of access 31 October 2008. Iceland Nootka Lupin Flower Iceland Nootka Lupin Flower Fields The Nootka lupine is common on the west coast of North America, and is one of the species from which the garden hybrids are derived, being valued in Britain and other North-European countries for its tolerance of cool, wet summers. In North-America, it grows along roadsides, gravel bars, and forest clearings from the Aleutian Islands and Southcentral Alaska, and along the Alaskan panhandle to British Columbia. Rigorous self-seeders as they are, lupine can often be seen along roadsides and in open meadows, their bright blueish purple flowers catching ones eye from quite a distance. Their long tap roots make transplanting difficult, so sowing seed is preferable. Taxonomy The species was first described as Lupinus nootkatensis in 1810 by James Donn in Botanical Magazine, Vol. 32, Page 1311.http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106372972 On the Plant List the species is divided in two varieties:http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Lupinus+nootkatensis * Lupinus nootkatensis var. fruticosus Sims * Lupinus nootkatensis var. nootkatensis is the subspecies. Toxicity A member of the pea family (Fabaceae), lupines form seeds in fuzzy pods that may be attractive to children. The seeds of the lupine can be toxic, though toxins flush through the system quickly and are not cumulative. However, internal use is not advised.http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/51569/#ixzz3pfpYktlh  Nootka lupine in Iceland  In Iceland, the Nootka lupine has been designated an invasive species.Icelandic Institute of Natural History, Invasive Plants in Iceland, accessed 7 May 2019 The plant was introduced in the first half of the 20th century to combat erosion, speed up land reclamation and help with reforestation. Dense lupine cover and soil fertility can be gained within a relatively short time span, where the growth of the lupine is not limited by droughts.Biological Diversity in Iceland (2001). National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Ministry for the Environment and the Icelandic Institute of Natural History The lupine is well suited for reclamation of large, barren areas because of its nitrogen fixation and rapid growth. Furthermore, it has an ability to extract phosphorus from compounds in poor soils.Sigurður Arnarson (2014). Belgjurtabókin. Sumarhúsið og garðurinn. In spite of these good qualities, it has a tendency to become dominant and to colonize already vegetated areas such as dwarf shrub-highlands, where it overtakes the natural flora and threatens biodiversity. The plant has spread from the loose, eroded soil in which it was originally planted and is now found throughout the lowlands of Iceland.Borgthor Magnusson, \\"NOBANIS – Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet: Lupinus nootkatensis,\\" pp. 4-5 The initial expectation was for the Nootka lupine to retreat gradually along with increased fertility of the soil and give way for other species. This is evident on sites in Iceland where the lupine was introduced early, such as in Heiðmörk near Reykjavík.Daði Björnsson (2011). Hörfar lúpínan? Dæmi úr Heiðmörk. (Does lupine retreat? The case of Heiðmörk) Skógræktarritið, The Journal of the Icelandic Forestry Association, the second issue of 2011. Skógræktarfélag Íslands. However, plant succession is towards a forb-rich grassland, often dominated by the invasive species Anthriscus sylvestris, meaning that careful management of lupine is necessary to prevent it from colonizing areas where its presence is not desirable.Borgthor Magnusson, \\"NOBANIS – Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet: Lupinus nootkatensis,\\" pp. 7-9 References Sources * Accessed 31 October 2008. * Biological Diversity in Iceland.

He taught at both Colorado and Minnesota was a research assistant at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was an assistant economist with the Bank of America before joining Stanford in 1954. Gray's early research concerned the potato market, analyzing the then evident decline in consumption of potatoes, the changing regional pattern of production, and the role of government policy in causing these changes. His research included studies of intertemporal pricing patterns, the causes of market success and failure, the role of speculators and hedgers in futures markets, and whether there is a necessary transfer of a risk premium to speculators. More recently he had studied world food problems, particularly as they relate to trade issues and the appropriate means of dealing with food reserves. Gray was a consultant for such policy and regulatory bodies as the Chicago Board of Trade, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as an expert witness in a number of famous manipulation and tax cases. He was the first to study the feasibility of a futures market in mortgage-backed instruments, the success of which in the 1970s inaugurated the huge growth of the financial futures markets.

With this distance, the set of isometry classes of n-dimensional normed spaces becomes a compact metric space, called the Banach–Mazur compactum.  Definitions  If X and Y are two finite-dimensional normed spaces with the same dimension, let GL(X,Y) denote the collection of all linear isomorphisms T : X → Y. With T we denote the operator norm of such a linear map -- the maximum factor by which it \\"lengthens\\" vectors.

We have δ(X, Y) = 0 if and only if the spaces X and Y are isometrically isomorphic. Equipped with the metric δ, the space of isometry classes of n-dimensional normed spaces becomes a compact metric space, called the Banach–Mazur compactum. Many authors prefer to work with the multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance :d(X, Y) := \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\delta(X, Y)} = \\\\inf { \\\\T\\\\ \\\\T^{-1}\\\\ : T \\\\in \\\\operatorname{GL}(X, Y) }, for which d(X, Z) ≤ d(X, Y) d(Y, Z) and d(X, X) = 1.

From this it follows that d(X, Y) ≤ n for all X, Y ∈ Q(n). However, for the classical spaces, this upper bound for the diameter of Q(n) is far from being approached. For example, the distance between ℓn1 and ℓn∞ is (only) of order n1/2 (up to a multiplicative constant independent from the dimension n). A major achievement in the direction of estimating the diameter of Q(n) is due to E. Gluskin, who proved in 1981 that the (multiplicative) diameter of the Banach–Mazur compactum is bounded below by c n, for some universal c > 0. Gluskin's method introduces a class of random symmetric polytopes P(ω) in Rn, and the normed spaces X(ω) having P(ω) as unit ball (the vector space is Rn and the norm is the gauge of P(ω)). The proof consists in showing that the required estimate is true with large probability for two independent copies of the normed space X(ω).

In the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City. Mexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post-Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by \\"the big three\\" painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s many murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States, where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement. Antecedents Mural from Bonampak. Mexico has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the Olmec civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine. The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was Juan Cordero in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the Santa Teresa Church and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of Gabino Barreda at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (since disappeared). 1903 broadsheet by José Guadalupe Posada. The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the Porfirio Díaz regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the Academy of San Carlos and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making Mexico like Europe. Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life. Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art. Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism. Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting. The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the Mexican Revolution . Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of José Guadalupe Posada, who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism. The Mexican Revolution itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to Porfirio Díaz policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes and José Vasconcelos. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. These ideas gained power as a result of the Mexican Revolution, which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year. However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of Francisco I. Madero who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the Álvaro Obregón faction, which became the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico's next generation of artists and muralists. Mural movement Colegio San Ildefonso project by Jean Charlot.alt= In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the Secretaría de Educación Pública. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos's idea to have a government-backed mural program for this purpose. Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals. These ideals or principles were to glorify the Mexican Revolution and the identity of Mexico as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish. The government began to hire the country's best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including Diego Rivera. These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, Ramón Alva de la Canal, Federico Cantú and others but the main three would be David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by Roberto Montenegro, but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out. The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors. Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by Rufino Tamayo. The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution Colegio San Ildefonso, at that time used for the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution; Fernando Leal painted [\\"dancers of Chalma\\"] \\"Los danzantes de Chalma\\", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, Jean Charlot painted La conquista de Tenochtitlán (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal. =After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School= This project at the institution was followed by projects at the Palacio Nacional, the interior walls of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Escuela Nacional de Chapingo the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the Secretaria de Educación Pública building among many others. Ramón Alva de la Canal, Mural at Colegio San Ildefonso The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country's transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico's identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings. One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors. The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts. On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico's indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of Marxism, especially the struggle of the working class against oppression. The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the \\"heroic\\" phase while the period after 1930 is the \\"statist\\" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924. Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who \\"acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences\\" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as \\"propaganda for a corrupt state\\" as taking a hard line. Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime. Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement. The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico. The country's policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society. Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice. The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels. Artistry Mural by Jorge González Camarena at the Palacio de Bellas Artes Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of \\"Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura\\" (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate. It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as: 1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse 2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”) 3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image Most painters in this school worked in Mexico City or other cities in Mexico, working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of Mexico and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos. Mural by Alfredo Zalce at the state government palace in Morelia. A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the Mexican Revolution, mestizo identity and Mesoamerican cultural history. These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement. The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government. The other political orientation was that of Marxism, especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists. The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left. Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country's history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses. The various reasons for the focus on ancient Mesoamerica may be divided into three basic categories: the desire to glorify the accomplishments of the perceived original cultures of the Mexican nation; the attempt to locate residual pre-Hispanic forms, practices, and beliefs among contemporaneous indigenous peoples; and the study of parallels between the past and present. Within this last context, the torture of Cuauhtémoc was painted by Siqueiros in 1950 in the Palacio Nacional, one of his few depictions of indigenous cultures of any period.Barnet-Sanchez, Holly (2001). \\"Mexican Mural Movement.\\" In Carrasco, David L (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures: he Civilizations of Mexico and Central America vol. 2: New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 300 - 302. The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures. Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or hot wax painting. Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros, who worked with pyroxene, a commercial enamel, and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos and old machinery, and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly. Los Tres Grandes The History of Mexico mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace, by Diego Rivera (1929-1935) By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Siqueiros, called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones). All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution. Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote Marxist ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war. However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera's works were utopian and idealist, Orozco's were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future. The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the Mexican Revolution. Rivera was in Europe during the revolution and had never experienced the horrors of the war. Because of this, his art primarily focused on what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. Orozco and Siqueiros both fought in the war, which subsequently resulted in a more pessimistic approach to their artwork when depicting the revolution; with Siqueros’ artwork being the most radical and focused on the scientific future. Miguel Hidalgo abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico's indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it. Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class. His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future. His work shows an \\"expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure.\\" Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period. Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the Mexican Revolution, having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced. View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the Venustiano Carranza army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines. Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a \\"futurist blurring of form and technique.\\" His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism. His radical politics made him unwelcome in Mexico and the United States, so he did much of his work in South America. However, his masterpiece is considered to be the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, located in Mexico City. = Revolutionary artistry = One of the best examples of his perspective on the revolution can be seen in his mural at the chapel of the Chapingo Autonomous University (murals) The most dominant artwork in this mural is The Liberated Earth 1926-27 Fresco which depicts Rivera's second wife, Guadalupe Marín, Voluptuous and recumbent, hand held aloft, she symbolizes the fertility of the land, and exudes a dominant, life- affirming energy which triumphs artistically against the injustices depicted elsewhere. Orozco's view point on the Mexican Revolution can be seen in his mural The Trench (1922-1924), Mexico that can be found at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. The dynamic lines and diluted color palette exemplify the dismal tone Orozco sets to exemplify his negative attitude towards the revolution. This kind of artwork sparked controversy and led to the defacing of this mural but was then later repainted in 1926. Siqueiros brought a nuance to the idea of the Mexican Revolution. Although he held a radically negative opinion towards the revolution, he also depicted images of the scientific future while the other two artists' primary focus was on their experience and view on the revolution. In 1939 Siqueros constructed a mural at the Electrical Workers Union Building titled Portrait of the Bourgeoise (1939), Mexico City Mexico. This piece of art demonstrates the horrors of war, Siqueros' view on the negative view towards the role of capitalism during the Revolution, and how the proletariat was overlooked and taken advantage of by the Bourgeoise. Among all this pessimistic imagery is also hope; which can be seen by the depiction of a lone man dressed in the clothing of a guerrilla fighter grasping a rifle that is pointed to figures of the Bourgeoise leaders during the revolution. This symoolizes a promising future in which Mexico overcomes the obstacles faced in the revolution and embraces technology, as seen in the depictions of electrical towers at the top of the mural. = Political expression = The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post- revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. José Vasconcelos, the Secretary of Public Education under President Álvaro Obregón (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government. Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “la raza cósmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos's criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works. In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors. Influence La Ciencia in Atlixco, Puebla by Jorge Figueroa Acosta After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country. One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the municipal market of Teotitlán del Valle, a small town in the state of Oaxaca. High school and college students from Georgia, United States, collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of Zapotec language and customs. Mural of Salvador Alvarado, former governor of Yucatan, displayed at the governor's palace, Merida (Yucatan), Mexico. Painted by Fernando Castro Pacheco. Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas. It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after World War I with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include Carlos Mérida of Guatemala, Oswaldo Guayasamín of Ecuador and Candido Portinari of Brazil . View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at Pomona College in Claremont, California, staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country. Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the Museum of Modern Art. The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country. Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to Los Angeles. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over. The only one of the three to survive, América Tropical (full name: América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos, or Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by ImperialismDel Barco, Mandalit.

Enterprise life cycle (ELC) in enterprise architecture is the dynamic, iterative process of changing the enterprise over time by incorporating new business processes, new technology, and new capabilities, as well as maintenance, disposition and disposal of existing elements of the enterprise.Chief Information Officer Council (2001). A Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture  Overview  The enterprise life cycle is a key concept in enterprise architecture (EA), enterprise engineeringKosanke, Kurt, F. Vernadat, and Martin Zelm]. \\"CIMOSA: enterprise engineering and integration.\\" Computers in industry 40.2 (1999): 83-97. and systems engineering.Ronald E. Giachetti (2011) Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods. p. 7 The Enterprise Architecture process is closely related to similar processes, as program management cycle or systems development life cycle, and has similar properties to those found in the product life cycle.Alain Bernard, Serge Tichkiewitch (2008). Methods and Tools for Effective Knowledge Life-Cycle-Management. p. 403 The concept of enterprise life cycle aids in the implementation of an enterprise architecture, and the capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process that selects, controls, and evaluates investments. Overlying these processes are human capital management and information security management. When these processes work together effectively, the enterprise can effectively manage information technology as a strategic resource and business process enabler. When these processes are properly synchronized, systems migrate efficiently from legacy technology environments through evolutionary and incremental developments, and the Agency is able to demonstrate its return on investment (ROI). The figure on top illustrates the interaction of the dynamic and interactive cycles as they would occur over time.  Enterprise life cycle topics  = Enterprise architecture process = Enterprise Architecture Process. As a prerequisite to the development of every enterprise architecture, each Agency should establish the need to develop an EA and formulate a strategy that includes the definition of a vision, objectives, and principles. The figure shows a representation of the EA process. Executive buy-in and support should be established and an architectural team created within the organization. The team defines an approach and process tailored to Agency needs. The architecture team implements the process to build both the baseline and target EAs. The architecture team also generates a sequencing plan for the transition of systems, applications, and associated business practices predicated upon a detailed gap analysis. The architecture is employed in the CPIC and the enterprise engineering and program management processes via prioritized, incremental projects and the insertion of emerging new technologies. Lastly, the architectures are maintained through a continuous modification to reflect the Agency's current baseline and target business practices, organizational goals, visions, technology, and infrastructure. = Architecture life cycle = DoDAF Architecture Life Cycle.DoD Architecture Framework Working Group (2003). DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0 Deskbook 15 August 2003. The figure depicts the life of the architecture as it evolves and shows the process that the architecture description supports in the development, analysis, and evolution of the implemented architecture. In this illustration, the Operational View is used to drive the requirements that are evaluated against the Systems View. Operational deficiencies are derived from the analysis, and viable candidates are identified. These candidates can take the form of either materiel or non- materiel solutions and are modeled back into the Operational and Systems Views of the architecture. The architecture is re-analyzed, and the process continues until the operational deficiencies are minimized. The final sets of viable candidates are assessed for operational viability. Based on the results of the assessments, design changes are made and submitted for inclusion into the budgeting process. This process of developing, analyzing, and modifying continues throughout the architecture’s life cycle. = Enterprise life cycle activities = TEAF Enterprise Life Cycle activitiesUS Department of the Treasury Chief Information Officer Council (2000). Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework . Version 1, July 2000. An enterprise life cycle integrates the management, business, and engineering life cycle processes that span the enterprise to align its business and IT activities. Enterprise life cycle refers generally to an organization's approach for managing activities and making decisions during ongoing refreshment of business and technical practices to support its enterprise mission. These activities include investment management, project definition, configuration management, accountability, and guidance for systems development according to a system development life cycle (SDLC). The enterprise life cycle applies to enterprise-wide planning activities and decision making. By contrast, a System Development Life Cycle generally refers to practices for building individual systems. Determining what systems to build is an enterprise-level decision. The figure on the right depicts notional activities of an enterprise life cycle methodology. Within the context of this document, Enterprise Life Cycle does not refer to a specific methodology or a specific bureau's approach. Each organization needs to follow a documented Enterprise Life Cycle methodology appropriate to its size, the complexity of its enterprise, and the scope of its needs. = Enterprise Performance Life Cycle = Illustration of the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (2007). HHS Enterprise Architecture Governance Plan FY2007. The Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) encompasses the major business functions executed under the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), and in particular shows at a high level the relationship among the different business functions and both the general order and the iterative nature of their execution. The placement of enterprise architecture in the center of the EPLC conceptual diagram, shown in the figure, reflects the supporting and enabling role that enterprise architecture serves for the major business functions in the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle. The Enterprise Architecture (EA) Program explicitly considers the information needs of the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) processes in developing and enhancing the EA Framework, collecting and populating data in the EA Repository, and developing views, reports, and analytical tools that can be used to facilitate the execution of the EPLC processes. The EPLC conceptual diagram in the figure provides a Departmental perspective of key business functions. The EPLC is also relevant from an individual investment or project perspective, as each new investment passes through each phase of the EPLC. The investment-level perspective is detailed in the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle Framework.

It acts as a selective 5-HT2A receptor agonist, the same target as that of psychedelic drugs like psilocin, but unlike these drugs, AL-34662 was designed specifically as a peripherally selective drug, which does not cross the blood–brain barrier. This means that AL-34662 can exploit a useful side effect of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists, namely reduction in intra-ocular pressure and hence relief from the symptoms of glaucoma, but without causing the hallucinogenic effects that make centrally active 5-HT2A agonists unsuitable for clinical use. In animal studies, AL-34662 has been shown to be potent and effective in the treatment of symptoms of glaucoma, with minimal side effects. Peripherally acting 5-HT2A agonists have been a rich field of research in recent years, with potential glaucoma treatments being the main proposed application for 5-HT2A agonists at present, as centrally acting agonists for this receptor tend to be hallucinogenic and thus their medical usefulness is currently limited to the treatment of psychiatric disorders. While many novel, potent and selective 5-HT2A agonists have been developed for this application, retaining peripheral selectivity can be a problem, and several of the more lipophilic compounds closely related to AL-34662 such as those shown below, did cross the blood–brain barrier and produced hallucinogen-appropriate responding in animals. 400px  See also  * AL-38022A * Ro60-0175 * VER-3323 * YM-348  References  Category:Indazoles Category:Amines Category:Peripherally selective drugs Category:Serotonin receptor agonists ","title":"AL-34662"},{"id":"20021314","text":"A public viewing area is a space set aside for members of the public to safely view sites of interest, such as airports, railroads, construction sites or other facilities.

The reef gets its name from Frederick, which first reported sighting the reef. Frederick Reef is a small atoll with a large rock called Ridge Rock at the southern end, a sand cay called Observatory Cay, and a lighthouse at the northern end, which is the only permanently dry land, although there are a few of others cays that can be awash at high tide. The reef is around 30km2. The reefs are in a J shape that forms a semi-enclosed lagoon known as Anchorage Sound, with an opening on the North side. The complex measures about , with an area of . The reef is located in some deep water and drops sharply to over on the western side.  General description  Satellite View of Frederick Reefs Chart of Frederick Reefs The Frederick Reefs are a small group of remote reefs located beyond the southern reaches of the Great Barrier Reef, The reef complex lies due east from the city of Mackay, Queensland or northeast of the city of Gladstone. The reefs are part of the southern reefs of the Coral Sea and as such are located in deep oceanic waters off the Coral Sea Shelf. Aside from its coastal neighbours, it also lies east from the Swains Reefs; the lower part of the Great Barrier Reef. Frederick Reefs is approximately northeast of the Saumarez Reefs and west of the northwest extremity of Kenn Reefs. The reefs form a semi-enclosed lagoon or body of water known as Anchorage Sound; protected on most sides but open on the north side. On the southern side of the reef lies Observatory Cay, (21°02'S., 154°23'E.), the only permanently dry land, although there are a few of others cays that can be awash at high tide. Observatory Cay is approximately above sea level; with a possible landing site on its northern side through a boat channel which leads in from North East through the reef. As the cay lies near the southern edge of the reef, the surf sometimes breaks over it in heavy gales. Similar to other smaller sand cays and spits, the position of the sand spit can move. In 1983, it was reported that Observatory Cay lay about west of the charted position. It has also been reported that the reef complex has at least 4 or 5 other sand cays on the southern reef which does not cover with water at high tide other than Observatory Cay. A solitary leaning rock, high, lies on the western extremity of the Observatory Cay southern reef, west-northwest of Observatory Cay. From Observatory Cay, the southern part of the reef extends to the north and northeast for . Danger Ridge (21°00'S., 154°21'E.) is a narrow ridge connecting the western end of Observation Cay and Ridge Rock. The North Reef Extreme is located to the north of Observatory Cay with its southern extremity about north southern extremity of the Observatory Cay reef. It is about long and about wide. A small cay ls located south of Frederick Reef Light. The Light is located at the northeastern tip of the reef which is the only section permanently out of the water. The Light is accessible by boat only. It has a nominal range of .  History  = Discovery = The reefs were discovered in 1812 by the Frederick. The reefs were described in the ship's log: = Shipwreck of Royal Charlotte = On 29 April 1825, Royal Charlotte arrived in Sydney from England with a load of convicts. The ship then took on detachments of the 20th, 46th, and 49th Regiments for transport to India by Batavia. On 11 June, the ship ran aground on Frederick Reefs; the masts were cut away to steady her while the crew and soldiers moved to shore with water and provisions before she sank. Only two lives were lost. A party took the surviving longboat and travelled to Moreton Bay, arriving in July and causing the brig Amity to be dispatched to collect survivors.Loney, J. K. (Jack Kenneth), 1925–1995. Australian shipwrecks Vol. 1 through 5 The discovery of the wreck was announced in January 2012. = Grounding of USS Tiru = On 2 November 1966, the United States submarine USS Tiru departed from Brisbane for Subic Bay. On 4 November, the submarine ran aground on Queenslands Frederick Reef. For two days, the submarine attempted to back off the reef under her own power, but was unsuccessful. On 6 November, Australian destroyer HMAS Vendetta and civilian tugboat Carlock arrived to assist the salvage of Tiru. The submarine was towed to Brisbane, where she was drydocked for emergency repairs and damage assessment. Following temporary repairs to her sonar dome, outer hull, and keel, the submarine gingerly made her way from Australia to the United States Naval Ship Repair Facility, Yokosuka, Japan. En route, Tiru called at Guam to provision alongside and pick up new crew members. Arriving at Yokosuka on 29 November, the submarine entered drydock for restricted availability. = Grounding of Jhansi Ki Rani = On 23 April 1986, Jhansi Ki Rani, an India- flagged bulk carrier departed from Newcastle, New South Wales for Japan with 74,000 tonnes of coal on board. The route for the voyage had been planned and plotted by the Second Officer, approved by the Master, and was to take the vessel east of Frederick Reef sometime on 26 April. During the Second Officer's watch, constant rain had reduced visibility from to . At 1515, an object was detected on radar, away to port. It was assumed that this was the Frederick Reefs Lighthouse, but was actually another ship, MV Fort Resolution. Two hours later, another radar echo was picked up, away. While attempting to clarify the indistinct radar signal, it became obscured by rain clutter, then vanished. Assumed to be a ship, the lookout was instructed to keep watch off the starboard bow. The ship's Master arrived on the bridge at 1725, to confirm the progress of the voyage and to prepare for the passing of Frederick Reefs. Shortly after this, the Chief Officer and lookout both reported a white line close ahead; waves breaking over the edge of the reef. The ship was ordered to swing hard to port, but did not swing far enough to clear the southern edge of the reef, running aground from the tower. The engines were stopped, and at 1736 were put full astern in an attempt to pull the ship off the reef. After almost two hours, the failed attempts ceased. Some oil pollution was observed after the grounding. This pollution was attributed to the forward oil fuel deep tank, which was damaged. All other fuel tanks were situated aft and were intact . The vessel was recovered and refloated on 4 May, and after being anchored for inspection, was towed to Singapore for repairs, then put up for auction with her cargo of coal.

Built in 1914, it was named after Ruby Potter, the step- daughter of its manager, Frank Potter. The original owners were Herbert R. Kingman and Morrison M. Kingman. Original seating capacity was 225 on the main level and 125 in the balcony. The theater was equipped as a cinema and as a vaudeville house. With the exception of 1972-1974, the Ruby has been showing movies for over ninety years, and is one of the oldest movie theaters in Washington. History Frank Potter moved his operation from the storefront Gem Theater to the Kingman's new Ruby when the Kingman's purpose-built theater opened. Competition initially came from the Auditorium, which burned shortly after the Ruby opened in 1914. Potter committed a murder/suicide in 1919, killing his wife and leaving behind 15-year-old Ruby. That year the Kingmans sold the theater to a barber named Kelsey from Omak. The Kelseys operated the theater themselves until 1937, then leased it to operators through 1972. The theater reopened in 1974. Description The Ruby theater is located in the central business district of Chelan. The facade is stuccoed, with a central snack bar window flanked by recessed arched entries. The entries are sheltered by a prominent projecting marquee guyed from the facade, lit with bare electric light bulbs. The marquee spans the width of the building, with a shallow central arch. The upper level of the facade features a pair of windows flanked by single sash windows in a slightly recessed bay, with a prominent RUBY THEATRE above. The original entrance was in the center. The lobby spans the width of the building with entries into the house on either side of the shallow space. The house is a narrow rectangular space with a small horseshoe- shaped balcony over the last few rows of seats. The twelve-foot-deep stage is elevated and features a gilded plaster proscenium. Additional depth is provided by a non-historic thrust stage extension, about deep. The stage retains its trap doors and lighting, as well as storerooms and ventilation equipment under the stage. The projection room is on the upper level behind the balcony, as are the toilets. The Ruby Theater was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 7, 1991.

Biography  Maruf was born in the district of Wasit or Karkh in Baghdad. His father's name was Firuz, which suggests that he was of Persian origin.Cyril Glasse, \\"The New Encyclopedia of Islam\\", Published by Rowman & Littlefield, 2008. His original religion is usually understood to have been Christian, which may mean that the Armenian Islamic preacher and mystic, Farqad Sabakhi, may have mentored Maruf Karkhi Historical dictionary of Sufism By John Renard, p. 87. Attar narrates in his Memorial of the Saints that Maruf converted to Islam at a young age at the hands of Ali ibn Musa, after rejecting all forms of polytheism. Tradition recounts that he immediately went and told his father and mother, who rejoiced at his decision and became Muslims themselves. After accepting Islam, Maruf became a student of Dawud Ta'i, and underwent a severe trial of his discipleship. Maruf, however, remained steadfast and proved himself so devout that his righteousness became locally famous. Sufi tradition In Sufism, those of the order of Marufi are those connected to Maruf Karkhi. Maruf thus forms a penultimate link in what is known as the Golden Chain (silsilah) of Sufism, the initiation line which forms an unbroken chain to Muhammad. Maruf, being the disciple of Ali ar-Ridha, formed part of that lineage, while at the same time maintaining the teachings of his master Dawud Ta'i and thus being his successor as well. Sufis venerate Maruf highly for the multiple spiritual chains which interlock in his teachings.What is Sufism?, M. Lings, p. 120, Suhail Academy.

Probably printed in 1805 The Minneapolis Institute of Art impression. Printed 1795 Nebuchadnezzar is a colour monotype print with additions in ink and watercolour portraying the Old Testament Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II by the English poet, painter and printmaker William Blake. Taken from the Book of Daniel, the legend of Nebuchadnezzar tells of a ruler who through hubris lost his mind and was reduced to animalistic madnessMyrone 2007, 82 and eating \\"grass as oxen\\".\\"Nebuchadnezzar, circa 1795 / 1805\\". Tate. Retrieved on November 1, 2008. According to the biographer Alexander Gilchrist (1828–1861), in Blake's print the viewer is faced with the \\"mad king crawling like a hunted beast into a den among the rocks; his tangled golden beard sweeping the ground, his nails like vultures' talons, and his wild eyes full of sullen terror. The powerful frame is losing semblance of humanity, and is bestial in its rough growth of hair, reptile in the toad-like markings and spottings of the skin, which takes on unnatural hues of green, blue, and russet.\\"Gilchrist 1998, 408–09 Nebuchadnezzar was part of the so-called Large Colour Prints; a series begun in 1795 of twelve 43 cm × 53 cm colour monotype prints, of most of which three copies were made. These were painted on millboard,a type of stiff board, especially used to make book covers. description after which the board was put through Blake's printing-press with a sheet of dampened paper to make the prints. After they were printed, Blake and his wife Catherine added ink and watercolour to the impressions.Bentley 2003, 158–59 and Wilson, 67 It existed in four impressions (copies), now in: Tate Britain in London, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,MFA, Boston, Butlin 302 the Minneapolis Institute of Art,Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Butlin 303 and a fourth which has been missing since 1887.Blake Archive Butlin 303 Blake believed that Nebuchadnezzar was connected to the Christian apocalypse and to his personal view on the stages of human development. History Detail of woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1512 Detail of The Penance of St. John Chrysostom, engraving, 1496 Nebuchadnezzar was adapted from an earlier print in Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.Lincoln 2003, 220 The plates for the Large Colour Prints and the first prints were made in 1795, but further impressions seem to have been printed in about 1805.Wilson, 67 In the late summer of 1805, Blake sold to Thomas Butts Jr. eight impressions of the Large Colour Prints, including the Tate Nebuchadnezzar, for £1.1s each.Bentley 2002, 191 John Clark Strange bought Butts's prints on 29 June 1853 and later acquired the rest of the collection that was sold to Henry George Bohn. Although he originally wanted to produce a biography on Blake, he later abandoned this idea after he learned of Gilchrist's biography. However, his journal was filled with his notes for the biography, and contain many accounts from those who knew Blake, excerpts from Blake's journal, and analysis of Blake's work.Bentley 2002, 493 In his journal, he describes Nebuchadnezzar \\"crawling on his belly, naked covered with hair & nails grown long, eating grass.—'What was singular was that Blake's conception was almost a facsimile of an ancient German print of the same subject and which design Blake had never seen.\\"quoted in Bentley 2002, 496 Kenneth Clark identified the earlier image as a book illustration of a werewolf by Lucas Cranach the Elder,The Early Illuminated Books. Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, Joseph Viscomi, David Bindman, 139, Princeton University Press, , although a closer similarity is with the small figure of the saint in Albrecht Dürer's 1496 engraving The Penance of St. John Chrysostom.Collins Baker, C. H. \\"The Sources of Blake's Pictorial Expression\\". 360. The Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Apr. 1941), 359–67. \\"Blake's ... appropriation and adaptation from Durer's 'St. John Chrysostom' is well known: we can hardly doubt that the invention of his Nebuchadnezzar came about in this wise. The little crawling figure in the background of Durer's print caught his fancy, so that when he wanted an idea for Nebuchadnezzar he thought, 'Why, that's the very thing; but I will show the face.' Incidentally, that alteration and an attempt to exhibit the outcast King's emaciation, deplorably overtaxed Blake's anatomical knowledge.\\" The print is Bartsch no. 63 Image Blake's relief etching of Nebuchadnezzar from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, c. 1790–93 Other versions Blake had earlier depicted Nebuchadnezzar on Plate 24 of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell naked on hands and knees carrying his crown.Damon 1988, 297 Nebuchadnezzar is represented as being in the wilderness and is, according to Samuel Palmer, similar to an older German woodcut where \\"almost the very same figure appears. Many years had elapsed after making his own design before Blake saw the wood cut.\\"quoted in Bentley 2002, 158 A further depiction was added to Edward Young's Night Thoughts Volume VII. The image of Nebuchadnezzar is connected in Blake with the apocalypse in which the three people that the biblical Nebuchadnezzar burned to death were united with the Son of God,Frye, 196 and this image is also connected to Blake's belief in four states of existence in which those burned are able to transcend into the final stage of human existence.Frye, 272 Also, Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a statue represents human history from the beginning until the Apocalypse,Frye, 252 and the image of Nebuchadnezzar's rule is connected to Blake's myth of Albion in The Four Zoas.Frye, 271 Critical response Alexander Gilchrist believed that \\"the metallic tinting of the moss-grown crags is rendered almost as successfully as in 'Newton', and the printing throughout the picture is well carried out, with none of the opaque oily surfaces which occur in some others of the series\\".Gilchrist 1998, 409 Dante Gabriel Rossetti commented: \\"Crawling on all fours in his shaggy insanity. The tawny beard trails across the left hand: the nails are literally 'like birds' claws', and the flesh tints very red and 'beefy'. The glaring eyes, too, have almost lost their human character. The background represents a thick jungle. A fine wild conception\\".quoted in Harper, 73 The image inspired a passage in the poem City of Dreadful Night (1870s) by James Thomson (1834–1882): > :After a hundred steps I grew aware :Of something crawling in the lane > below; :It seemed a wounded creature prostrate there :That sobbed with pangs > in making progress slow, :The hind limbs stretched to push, the fore limbs > then :To drag; for it would die in its own den. :But coming level with it I > discerned :That it had been a man; for at my tread :It stopped in its sore > travail and half-turned, :Leaning upon its right, and raised its head, :And > with the left hand twitched back as in ire :Long grey unreverend locks > befouled with mire. :A haggard filthy face with bloodshot eyes, :An infamy > for manhood to behold. – Canto XVIII, from line 13Text of the City of > Dreadful Night – the figure speaks in the following passage.

The 1919 frame building features Mission Style detailing, and seats just under 300. The theater ceased operations in 1959 and had been used as a storage building until 1997, when new owners restored the theater for community use. History The Nifty Theatre was built in 1918 by W.P. Brown, opening it in 1919 and living in the basement with his wife. The Browns operated the theater until 1959. According to a sale prospectus dated 1946, Brown was a graduate of Washington State University and a wounded military veteran, who had acquired of land and operated a stable of racehorses on the proceeds from the theater. The theater showed both movies and vaudeville shows, as well as community activities and productions. Brown closed the theater in 1959 due to competition from television and died the next year. Mrs. Brown sold the theater to Claude Case for $1.00, retaining the right to live in the apartment, living there until she died in 1970. Case owned the property until 1997, using the theater for storage for his collections and his construction business, with no alterations. The theater was acquired by Jim and Jenna Dixon in 1997, who operate the theater as a community theater. Description The Nifty Theatre was built as both a nickelodeon movie house and as a vaudeville theater, even though the nickelodeon era was largely past in 1919, when palace-style movie theaters were starting to be built. As Waterville was a small town, the Nifty was a relatively modest theater that with its flat floor partially could serve as a dance hall and as a prize-fighting arena. The freestanding building stands a block away from the Downtown Waterville Historic District. Its main facade is stuccoed with pilasters at the corners and a curved parapet.

The Observer Group experimented in the methodology and equipment for projecting reconnaissance from the sea before the establishment of the OSS Maritime Unit, the Underwater Demolition Teams, and before the Army Special Forces and Air Commandos. It was also the birth of naval amphibious intelligence. Organization On January 13, 1941, Major General Holland M. Smith relinquished command of 1st Marine Division and became Commanding General of I Corps (Provisional), U.S. Atlantic Fleet with Colonel Graves B. Erskine as his Chief of Staff. Throughout the year, the joint command, which was assembled together at Quantico, Virginia, was subsequently redesignated variously several times: Task Force 18, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; 1st Joint Training Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; Atlantic Amphibious Force; Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet; and finally Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet. Colonel Erskine, under General Smith, was in charge of the Intelligence section jointly devised the plan in organizing a unit of men that were specialized in reconnoitering enemy shores for the upcoming mission of invading Europe and North Africa during World War II. By December 1941, when the United States has entered the war, the joint unit was designated as the \\"Observer Group\\", which was composed of a small group of soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division and Marines from the First Marine Division; two officers and 22 enlisted men. The Marines were mostly from the 5th Marines' Battalion Intelligence (S-2) and Regiment Intelligence Sections (R-2), and the Division Intelligence Sections (G-2) of the 1st Marine Division. The Observer Group was led by 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord, Jr. of the United States Army and began to operate under the staff supervision of the Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet G-2 by Army Lieutenant Colonel Louis Ely. Captain James Logan Jones Sr. was assigned to working under Colonel Erskine as the Assistant G-2 of the Intelligence section, under the Amphibious Corps staff, at the request of the Commanding General of Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, Major General Holland Smith. Jones was fluent in several foreign languages, was extremely familiar with the target area of Africa; had experience with mechanical and mechanized vehicles and machinery, had experience in living in foreign lands, and had a military schooling and background. Because of these qualifications, he was assigned in February 1942 until September 1942, during which time he was promoted to Captain. In August 1942, both the Army and Navy separated their joint effort and continued its planning for North Africa in Operation Torch. By September, the Navy established the Amphibious Scout and Raider School on NAB Little Creek, subsequently forming the Navy Scouts & Raiders unit. On 7 January 1943, the remaining Observer Group, with Captain James L. Jones Sr. commanding, formed the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, Expeditionary Troops, Amphibious Corps Pacific Fleet (ACPF). Training Most of the training was done on the Potomac, the Chesapeake Bay area (upper Chesapeake River and Norfolk), and NAB Little Creek, Virginia; and off the coast of Maryland, particularly St. Mary's and Solomon Island, which became their simulated battleground as squads attempted to scout each other's defenses. Submarine training took place at Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut in June 1942. The Observer Group began to conduct reconnaissance exercises on both the Atlantic and the Caribbean, (just as the Fleet Marine Force's Fleet Landing Exercises had done a few years before) by the Marines' Platoon Sergeant Russell Corey. He trained the Observer Group in hands-on work at sea abroad fleet submarines and in the tower for instructions in the Momsen lung. Another Marine by the name of Sergeant Thomas L. Curtis was selected from the Observer Group and was sent to the United Kingdom to train with the British Royal Marines and subsequently was transferred to Office of Strategic Services (precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency). They began experimenting in the methodology for launching reconnaissance from the sea and testing various equipment. Inflatable rubber boats were mostly used, although kayaks and canvas folding boats had been tested but were rejected. The determining criteria for boat selection was that recon boats needed to fit through the small hatches of fleet submarines while carrying weapons and equipment and be capable of handling related loads. Lt. Peddicord designed an inflatable boat and brought his plans to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company who produced the Landing Craft Rubber-Small craft able to hold seven men that was extensively used by the later Naval Combat Demolition Units.pp.16-17 Dockery, Kevin & Brutsman, Bud Navy SEALS: A History of the Early Years Berkley 2007 The Marines were trained and taught knife fighting and escaping techniques in Shanghai by British Commando Instructor Lieutenant Colonel William E. Fairbairn, formerly an Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police. Fairbairn was one of the developers, along with another Inspector, Eric A. Sykes of the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife that was used by the Marine Recon units and later adopted by the Marine Raiders and the Paramarines during World War II. Around this time the Observer Group was sent to the School for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also shared the same base at Quantico, and were trained by FBI Agents for two weeks in the rudiments of jujitsu, pistol shooting from the hip, and operation of the Thompson submachine gun, or TSMG. While the Observer Group was practicing their operational skills, the Intelligence Officers had worked out the tactical utilization of amphibious reconnaissance developing a new doctrine and organizational plan for the Fleet Marine Force. With the assignment to the United States Army of primary responsibility for the Atlantic (Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet) and to the United States Navy of primary responsibility for the Pacific (the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet), the joint command under General Smith divided as he relocated from Quantico to Camp Elliott, northeast of San Diego, California.

Biography Nicholas Mormando was the son of Italian-American emigrants from Morimondo in Milan, Italy. Upon arriving to New York City their surname was changed to \\"Mormando\\". Unlike Sammy Gravano, Gerard Pappa, Ralph Ronga, James Emma and other notorious budding mobsters, Nicholas was born in Schenectady, New York. He was a close childhood friend of fellow Gambino crime family mob associate Michael DeBatt who was only two years older than himself. He was considered a \\"key man\\" in Sammy Gravano's crew with Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo, Liborio (Louie) Milito, Joseph Paruta, Thomas (Huck) Carbonero. Unlike crew members Joseph D'Angelo Sr., Liborio Milito, Joseph Paruta and Michael DeBatt, Gravano does not mention having a close relationship with him or Mormando's relatives. Sammy Gravano later said, \\"For one week he (himself) would be flush with cash, but two weeks later he would be broke. He never saved any money. He shopped for clothes, picked up tabs at restaurants and night clubs, handed out huge tips and dined on champagne and filet mignon at the Copacabana.\\" Sammy later said of himself, Michael and his young aspiring mob associates, \\"Fucking kids, all dressed up like jerk-offs, running around, doing a little gambling, doing a little this and that \\"and then broke again and it's \\"macaroni and ricotta at home or spaghetti, past e olio, with the oil and garlic.\\" By 1984 he had become exiled from the Gambino crime family and \\"put on the shelf\\" being excluded from all criminal activities with the crime family. Shootout with the Gallos He took an oath with the other Rampers, \\"... be together forever. Fuck the world. Fuck everybody, even the mob\\" and was said by Gravano to be full of \\"piss and vinegar.\\" Later on, this would change but that was the attitude they held at that point in their lives. In the early 1960s, during the Profaci-Gallo civil war in the Colombo crime family had an encounter with Gerard, Sammy Gravano, James Emma, Joe Vitale, Tommy Snake and Lenny the Mole including a bunch of other gang members. They were hanging around in a bar at 79th Street and Utrecht Avenue. In the bar were several Gallo loyalists. They were a lot older than the Rampers and had an outstanding argument with associate James Emma. They were heavily armed so Nicholas and the others loaded up with firearms and headed back to the bar. Sammy later recounted the brutal gun battle in his autobiography, > It was a long bar. They were at one end of the bar and we were at the other > end. It seemed like one of them went for a gun. We went for guns. There were > a ton of shots thrown back and forth. It was like a cowboy movie. Totally > unbelievable. Glass breaking, women screaming, things falling on the floor. > One of the Gallo guys got hit, like eleven times. He staggers out of the bar > and falls in the street. And lived, believe it or not. Another guy in the > bar, an innocent bystander got hit in the foot. He went on his own to a > doctor and never said nothing. The Gallo guy at the hospital don't say > nothing, either. He was involved in burglaries of local commercial franchises, fencing stolen goods, armed robbery and car theft. Frank Fiala murder Gravano stationed Nicholas in a car parked around the corner from the Plaza Suite. He had a shotgun. If anyone in the group that normally accompanied Fiala drew a gun, he was to start shooting. His friend Michael DeBatt was positioned by his usual post as bouncer by the front door of the night club. After Frank Faila was murdered and pandemonium erupted out front of The Plaza Suite, Sammy had a getaway car stationed up the street. Down at the corner Nicholas had his shotgun ready but Fiala's people were in total shock. They did nothing. After the shooting, Nicholas and the other trigger men assembled at Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo's bar, Doc's. Gravano congratulated Mormando, his friend DeBatt and the others on a \\"beautiful piece of work.\\" Since this was not a sanctioned murder by their boss Paul Castellano, it could not go down that Mormando could be eligible to become a \\"made man\\" in the Gambino crime family for his involvement. He was never indicted or convicted for being accessory to the murder of James Faila. After the murder of Faila, Castellano was angry. He had Mormando, DeBatt and the others stay up at his New Jersey farm to lie low. After hearing the news that Castellano might order their executions over the unsanctioned murder, when given the chance by Sammy to leave, Mormando said, \\"Sammy, we'll load up. We're ready.\\" He earned the nickname \\"Cowboy\\" because he was known to perform criminal acts on his own without knowledge of Sammy Gravano or the Gambino crime family which was against the regulations. A renegade In retribution for being exiled due to his insubordination, Mormando started a crew of small-time armed robbers, truck hijackers, burglars and drug dealers of his own. It is unknown how successful his leadership skills were and if the gang actually formed. It is thought that Nicholas was planning to battle it out with Sammy Gravano and other members of the Gambino crime family that he felt had slighted him. It is thought that after the death of Mormando, the gang dissipated and fell apart without another leader to replace him. It is unknown if his childhood friend Michael DeBatt, who was also heavily addicted to drugs was being persuaded to join Mormando's team of criminals. This worried Sammy Gravano, Frank DeCicco, Carmine Fatico and Salvatore Aurello whose criminal territory was starting to be threatened by Mormando. Drug addiction and falling out with Gravano Nicholas Mormando had become hooked on crack cocaine and cocaine. Sammy Gravano suspected that Mormando also got his friend Michael DeBatt hooked on the potent narcotic. Sammy later said about Nicholas,: > He became like a renegade. He went berserk. He didn't want to be in the crew > no more. He was going to start his own little gang. I couldn't take a chance > on him running around. He knew too much. So I got permission from John (John > Gotti) to kill him. We finally got Nicky to come by Tali's, and he went with > Huck (Thomas Carbonaro) to pick up Old Man (Joseph Paruta), who was still > alive then. Joe got in the backseat and shot Nicky twice in the back of the > head. Sammy Gravano and his brother-in-law Edward Garofalo were trailing in a car behind them. While both cars were driving on West 9th Street, near Bay Parkway, Mormando's corpse was thrown out of the car into a vacant lot. It was found the next day. The murder of Nicholas Mormando remained unsolved until Sammy Gravano gave testimony at John Gotti's racketeering trial. Personal toll on Michael DeBatt It is unknown how Michael DeBatt dealt with the murder of his friend or if he attended Nicholas' funeral. Michael continued to serve in the crew of Sammy Gravano after Mormando's murder. It is also unknown if Michael associated his friend's killing with Gravano or thought of it as a drug transaction gone bad. Michael DeBatt was murdered in 1987 on the orders of Sammy Gravano. Unlike the time when he would order the murder of DeBatt, Sammy Gravano shows no remorse in ordering the execution of Mormando. Wrongful death suit In November 1998, a wrongful death suit was filed by the surviving relatives of Nicholas, Michael DeBatt and Joseph Colucci. According to court documents Sammy Gravano admitted to playing a direct or indirect role in their murders in the plea agreement that he made with the government when agreeing to become a stool pigeon. Along with Gravano, Mormando's family and the others filed suits against the author of Gravano's autobiography, Peter Maas; Maas' literary agency I.C.M.; the publisher of the autobiography, Harper Collins; and 20th Century Fox that was allegedly preparing a film adaptation of the book. These complaints sought relief for the plaintiffs in the form of \\"monetary and punitive damages from all defendants for their intentional failure to comply with New York's Son of Sam Law ... and their deliberate scheme to circumvent same.\\" Previously during the spring of 1997, the State Crime Victims Board and State Attorney General Dennis Vacco had launched a similar lawsuit against Sammy Gravano and many of the same co-defendants during their criminal trial.

He migrated to Australia in 1994 and lives in Melbourne, Australia. Career Abidi has written translations, travelogues, and a number of short stories, including the Borgesian The Secret History of the Flying Carpet, which is a fictitious story in a seemingly scholarly essay. His first novel, Passarola Rising (2006), was published by Viking Penguin in Australia, USA, Canada and India and translated into Spanish and Portuguese. It is set in Europe during the eighteenth century and is the fictionalised story of a true life Brazilian priest and aviation pioneer, Bartolomeu de Gusmão, who built a flying ship but fell foul of the Inquisition. Written in the style of an old-fashioned adventure story, it is a veiled criticism of the scientific materialism emerging from the European Enlightenment, and its inability to explain spiritual and supernatural phenomena.A conversation with Azhar Abidi . Passarola Rising was shortlisted for the 2006 Melbourne Literature Prize. In his second novel, Twilight (2008), Abidi turns to domestic and realist themes. Set in Pakistan during the 1980s, it is the story of an elderly matriarch, and her reaction to the changes she sees in her family and society during the turbulent times. Twilight is published by Text Publishing in Australia and by Viking Penguin in the United States and India. It appears in the United States as The House of Bilqis (2009). In 2010, Abidi wrote an essay on Pakistan, The Road to Chitral, for Granta Online, which is a travelogue and a meditation on violence in the region.

From 1928 to 1934 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw with Professor M. Kotarbinski, and in 1935 he became Assistant Professor at the Academy. Between 1936 and 1939 he taught at the Academy and in other Warsaw schools. World War II When Nazi Germany attacked Poland on September 1, 1939, German Nazis began rounding up and killing the local intelligentsia (see: Operation Tannenberg) and forbade all higher education except for vocational (\\"useful\\") training. Abraszewski survived five different Nazi concentration camps, including the Wildflecken Labor Camp and Mauthausen, where he made minute sketches for the administration.

Unwilling to return to Communist-ruled Poland after the Second World War, Abraszewski spent several years in Polish Displaced Persons camps in Germany where he taught art to refugees. In 1949, Abraszewski arrived in San Francisco with his wife who also graduated from Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and who also survived Nazi concentration camps. Piotr Abraszewski painted scenes of San Francisco in oil and watercolor. It was Piotr Abraszewski’s dream to paint frescoes in churches and public buildings. In the mid-1950s he worked as a commercial artist at The Emporium. He was a member of the Western Artists Society. Several of his paintings were exhibited at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park. When Mr. Abraszewski became a member of the Polish Arts and Culture Foundation The Polish Arts and Culture Foundation (established in 1966 in San Francisco), he participated in historical exhibits, created hand-made signs still in use today and, with encouragement of the Foundation, exhibited his work. He painted scenes of Europe as well as a series of oils and watercolors of San Francisco. Several years before Mr. Abraszewski fell ill, ten of his favorite paintings were photographed and produced as postcards. Mr. Piotr Abraszewski died in 1992 (his wife preceded him in death by several years). In his will, Piotr Abraszewski donated his entire art collection to the Polish Arts and Culture Foundation.

He retired on January 3, 2008.http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org Upon his retirement from the Diocese of Amarillo, Bishop Yanta moved to San Antonio, Texas, remaining active in socially conservative political causes. Bishop Yanta has been an opponent of legal abortion in the United States, making many personal sacrifices to this cause over the years. He has been a strong supporter of Catholic schools, and tells so in an interview. In 2006, he won the Cardinal von Galen Award for courageous pro-life leadership by leading pro-life demonstrations, requesting that anyone affiliated with Planned Parenthood resign their positions, even going so far as to offer to help them find other employment. He also famously wrote to the University of Notre Dame about their invitation to President Obama, a supporter of legal abortion, and no longer supports his once-loved team and university.http://www.hli.org/index.php/news/von-galen- awards/726?task=viewhttp://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/yanta- elections.htmhttp://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/09-05-14-yanta- notre-dame.htm Bishop Yanta was also recognized in 2005 by the Catholic Television of San Antonio (CTSA) as one of the founders and the first executive director of Catholic Television of San Antonio. “It is fitting that we honor Bishop Yanta, who was one of the first individuals in the San Antonio Archdiocese to recognize the value of the television medium as a tool to share God’s word in this community,” said Mary Ullmann Japhet, chairperson of the CTSA Board of Directors. “On a personal level, Bishop Yanta has been an inspiration to me, and I am grateful for his leadership.”http://www.satodayscatholic.com/honor.aspx Controversies during tenure When a 17-year-old girl in the Amarillo diocese came forward claiming to have been impregnated by a priest in 2003, Bishop Yanta agreed to a US$27,000 legal settlement to avoid a lawsuit.\\"Diocese settles paternity lawsuit filed by teen girl\\" Houston Chronicle, February 28, 2003 Bishop Yanta was critical of \\"zero tolerance\\" policies when it came to priests accused of sexual abuse.

With the completion of the Marina Barrage on 30 October 2008, the reservoir, which contained mainly salt water, became freshwater and started operations at 7 pm on 20 November 2010 after a process of natural desalination, when excess water was released out to the sea after heavy rains. The reservoir will provide 10% of the island's water needs. The catchment area that feeds the reservoir is about one-sixth the land size of Singapore, making it the largest of all the Singaporean reservoirs. Two of the island's most notable rivers - the Singapore River and Kallang River are part of the reservoir. The Geylang River and the Rochor River, both tributaries of the Kallang River form part of this reservoir as well.

Report by DOROTHY GRIMM. His songs have been covered by Buddy Williams, Auriel Andrew and Trevor Adamson.  Early life  Laughton was born on 7 February 1927 on a rocky outcrop on the edge of the Todd River in Alice Spring to Simon Rieff, a Russian miner, and a local Aboriginal woman whose name is not recorded. As a toddler he was taken from his mother, who he wouldn't see again till he was in his 20s, and was sent to The Bungalow, which was then at the Jay Creek site. When he was five The Bungalow moved to the Telegraph Station site and he walked, with a group, the 48 km distance from one to another. Laughton started his music careers while at The Bungalow, following inspiration from country singer Tex Morton, who visited when he was just ten years old and his upbringing here inspired his song 'Old Bungalow Days' and the history of Central Australia, more generally, became one of the main themes of his music. Laughton lived at The Bungalow until the age of fifteen when he went to work on various stations throughout the Territory.

The river finally empties into the Kallang Basin near Tanjong Rhu in the southern part of Kallang near the Tanjong Rhu Suspension Bridge. The Geylang Park Connector of the Park Connector Network (PCN) runs almost parallel to the Geylang River, providing a stretch of recreational space along the river between Guillemard Road and Tanjong Rhu. The Paya Lebar Quarter straddles both sides of the Geylang River. Geylang River has gone through a two years long revamp initiated by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) programme, which revitalised the waterway while preserving the rich heritage of the areas around Geylang River, and was opened by Guest-of-Honour Associate Professor Fatimah Lateef, Member of Parliament for Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency. As part of the revamp, Geylang River was also deepened and widened to increase its capacity and enhance flood protection. As part of an Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters project by Paya Lebar Quarter, a natural rain garden which treats surface runoff using plants and soil was also set up to improve the quality of the river's water.

His paternal ancestors were originally from Latium in Central Italy. They had immigrated to Anatolia in the time of the late Roman Republic. Varus came from a local, wealthy family who were prominent and they came from an unknown town in Galatia. His family owned large estates in Galatia. Apart from this, not much is known on the family and early life of Varus. Between the years of 56-69, Varus served as a Praetor during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero. He entered the Roman Senate as a praetor and through this entry, became a Roman Senator. After his service as a praetor, Varus implied treasonable behavior by a Roman called Dolabella. A Roman woman called Triaria (second wife of Lucius Vitellius the younger and sister-in-law to the brief future Roman Emperor Aulus Vitellius) terrified the City Prefect Titus Flavius Sabinus (brother to future Roman Emperor Vespasian) warning Sabinus not to seek a reputation for clemency by endangering Nero. Coin struck under Varus, showing the profile of Emperor Vespasian, and the inscription \\"Marcus Plancius Varus Proconsul\\" in Greek During the reign of Roman Emperor Vespasian (69-79), Varus served as governor of the public province of Bithynia and Pontus. During his time in Nicaea, the capital of the Roman province of Bithynia, Varus had struck coinage honoring the Roman State and himself. Julia became a priestess and served in the temple of the Ancient Greek Goddess Artemis in Perga. Artemis was the most important Goddess in Perga. In Perga, the city’s most magnificent structure was the Hellenistic Gate that was the entrance to the city. Inside in the courtyard of the Hellenistic Gate, there are inscribed bases of statues that bear the names of Marcus Plancius Varus and his son. From these inscriptions it is understood that Varus along with his son were wealthy, influential and generous citizens in Perga. Varus and his son were made benefactors whom they contributed to the prosperity of Perga. Due to the goodness and generosity of Varus and his son, they were both accepted as the second founders of the city. For who they were both honored with the title ‘’Ktistes’’ or ’’Founder’‘. Varus also had contributed to the construction of the North Gate of Nicaea/İznik, now called Istanbul Gate, that was built between 70-71. He had appeared to have died before 81. There is a possibility that Varus could be buried west of this Gate. His epitaph was written and dedicated in common Emperorship by Vespasian and his son Titus. Varus’ epitaph is preserved inside the Istanbul Gate. His epitaph was written in metal letters:  Family  At unknown date Varus married the Herodian Princess Julia, the daughter of King Tigranes VI of Armenia and sister of prince Gaius Julius Alexander. Julia bore Varus two children: * Son, Gaius Plancius Varus, consul during the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian. * Daughter, Plancia Magna, who married the Roman Senator Gaius Julius Cornutus Tertullus.

The reef covers an area of approximately 40 km2, with an islet in the Southeast part of the reef called Observatory Cay which is approximately 2 m above the high tide level It is part of the Coral Sea Islands and is over 280 nm north-east from Gladstone, Queensland. Kenn Reef is located on part of a submerged continental block, called the Kenn Plateau. This block drifted from Australia around 64 to 52 million years ago. The atoll is believed to be volcanic in origin. The reef was discovered by Mr. Alexander Kenn, Master of the ship William Shand, on her passage from Sydney to Batavia, General Satellite image of Kenn Reefs Map of Kenn Reefs Kenn Reef is a remotely situated reef in the south eastern waters of the Coral Sea, it lies approximately 100 km northeast from Bird Islet part of the Wreck Reefs and 140 km southeast from the Frederick Reefs; the Bellona Reefs of New Caledonia are located a further 277 km to the east, with the Australian mainland being located over 500 km to the southwest. Kenn Reef is part of a submerged continental block, called the Kenn Plateau. The Kenn Plateau lies off the north eastern Australian coast and is a region characterised by a series of prominent, bathymetric troughs and marginal plateaux. And is submerged by 1000 m to over 3000 m of water. The Kenn Plateau, covers around 100,000 km2, an area larger than the Tasmanian landmass. Various islands and reefs, whose origin is thought to be related to the Tasmantid Seamount Chain, lie along the western margin of the Kenn Plateau and include the well known Kenn Reef and Bird and Cato Island. The Kenn Plateau is thought to have formed as a sliver of continental crust, resulting from the rifting and seafloor spreading that occurred between 95 and 52 million years ago, along the eastern Australian margin forming the Tasman and Coral Sea basins The Kenn Reef areas consists of four main reefs which cover an area of approximately 40 km2 looking like a backward facing L-shaped structure (or boot) of 15 km in length, with a maximum width of 8 km along the southern edge. The three southerly reefs (the toe, foot & ankle and shin of the boot) lie upon a common shelf from which the northern (leg) reef is separated from by a deep channel. The smallest unit and most westerly of this chain (the toe), contains a conspicuous boulder, 1.8m high, on its NE side, which from a distance appears as part of a wreck. Landing can be made on the SW side of the reef. An exposed wreck of a long liner lies on the S side of the reef. The ankle or the South Eastern reef is the largest reef and with two sand cays on the SW part of the reef the only permanently emergent land the tiny Observatory Cay , which is about l00m by 50m and 2m high with a little vegetation. The western side of the ankle of the reef complex forms a bay All the reefs dry at half-tide, and the sea breaks over all of them except for the South Western reef. The Northern (or leg) reef encloses a shallow lagoon, which is entered on its Western side near the Southern end.

Background  Liu Congyi was born in 742, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He came from a line of officials of Tang Dynasty, starting with his great-great-grandfather Liu Linfu (劉林甫). His great-granduncle Liu Xiangdao served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, and Liu Xiangdao's son Liu Jingxian served as a chancellor late in the reign of Emperor Gaozong as well as the regency of Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) over their sons Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong.New Book of Tang, vol. 106. Liu Congyi's grandfather Liu Lingzhi (劉令植) served as a deputy minister, while his father Liu Ruzhi (劉孺之) served as the deputy mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆), which included the Tang capital Chang'an.Old Book of Tang, vol. 125 .  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Liu Congyi himself passed the imperial examinations when he was young, and during the Dali era (766-779) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, he passed a special examination for those who could write in a grand style. He was thereafter made Xiaoshulang (校書郎), an editor at the Palace Library. He subsequently served as the sheriff of Weinan County (渭南, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). Because his behavior was elegant, he was respected by the official Chang Gun, and after Chang became chancellor in 777, he made Liu Jiancha Yushi (監察御史), an imperial censor. Later, though, when Liu's mother died, he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for her.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  When Liu Congyi's mourning period was complete, the emperor was Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, and the most powerful chancellor was Lu Qi. Lu recommended Liu, and Liu returned to the bureau of censors as Shiyushi (侍御史). After several months, because a relative of his was also becoming an imperial censor, under Tang regulations that relatives should not serve at the same agency, he was made Xingbu Yuanwailang (刑部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu). In 783, with Li Xilie the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) rebelling against imperial rule, Emperor Dezong, believing that the armies sent against Li Xilie needed a supreme commander to coordinate their actions, commissioned his son Li Yi (李誼) the Prince of PuLi Yi was actually Emperor Dezong's nephew — the son of Emperor Dezong's brother Li Miao (李邈), but was adopted by Emperor Dezong at the directions of Emperor Dezong. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 150 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. to be the supreme commander of the forces against Huaixi, and he made Liu a secretary for Li Yi. However, before Li Yi could depart Chang'an, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at Chang'an to await deployment to the east against Li Xilie or other warlords, mutinied after they were not awarded as they believed they deserved. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Many officials followed him there, including Liu. The Jingyuan soldiers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu soon claimed imperial title of his own state of Qin, competing with Emperor Dezong. While Emperor Dezong was thus kept at Fengtian, he made Liu the deputy minister of justice (刑部侍郎, Xingbu Shilang) and gave him the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Xiao Fu and Jiang Gongfu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. When Emperor Dezong was forced to further flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) in 784, he made Liu Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), and continued to have Liu serve as chancellor. It was said that Liu was much liked by Emperor Dezong and was known for being careful and virtuous personally, but did not help Emperor Dezong correct his ways. After the general Li Sheng destroyed Zhu's regime later in 784 and allowed Emperor Dezong to return to Chang'an, there was an incident in which Xiao, who had just returned from a mission to survey the southern circuits, recommended that Chen Shaoyou (陳少遊), the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), who had submitted to Li Xilie during the time Emperor Dezong was away from Chang'an, be replaced by Wei Gao — a Fengxiang officer who had resisted Li Chulin. Emperor Dezong agreed. He sent the imperial eunuch messenger Ma Qinxu (馬欽緒) to inform Liu and ask Liu to discuss this matter with Xiao without consulting fellow chancellors Li Mian and Lu Han. However, Xiao was surprised by this, and, finding it inappropriate that Emperor Dezong was keeping secrets away from Li Mian and Lu, as fellow chancellors, stated:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. When Liu informed Emperor Dezong about this, Emperor Dezong was displeased. Xiao, seeing that he had lost the emperor's favor, resigned. Further, when Emperor Dezong tried to promote Lu Qi, who had been exiled after being blamed for causing Zhu's rebellion, in 785, and the imperial attendant Yuan Gao (袁高) objected, Liu and Lu Han did not dare to support Yuan's position. Yuan had to protest the decision along with several of his junior colleagues and finally prevailed on Emperor Dezong to change Emperor Dezong's mind. Liu grew ill in late 785 and offered to resign. On November 3, 785, Emperor Dezong removed him from his chancellor position and made him the minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu). Liu died the next day and was publicly mourned.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 125. * New Book of Tang, vol. 106. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 228, 229, 231, 232.

Varus was the son of the Roman Senator and Proconsul Marcus Plancius Varus, and the Herodian Princess Julia. His sister was Plancia Magna; he was therefore the maternal uncle to Gaius Julius Plancius Varus Cornutus. Varus was born and raised in Perga, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia. His maternal grandparents were King Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli, while his maternal uncle was prince Gaius Julius Alexander. Varus was of Roman, Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian and Persian ancestry. Varus’ maternal ancestors were King Archelaus of Cappadocia, King of Judea Herod the Great, and his wife Mariamne. Varus along with his maternal cousins were among the last known descendants of the Herodian Dynasty. He appeared to be an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that Varus attempted to exert influence on Judean politics. Varus served as a Roman Senator and became a consul at an unknown date during the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian who ruled the Roman Empire from 117-138. It is unknown whether Varus had married or had any children. In Perga, the city’s most magnificent structure was the Hellenistic Gate that was the entrance to the city. Inside in the courtyard of the Hellenistic Gate, there are inscribed bases of statues that bear the names of Varus and his father. From these inscriptions it is understood that Varus with his father were wealthy, influential and generous citizens in Perga. Varus and his father were made benefactors who contributed to the prosperity of Perga. Due to the goodness and generosity of Varus and his father, they were both accepted as the second founders of the city. They were both honored with the title ‘’Ktistes’’ or ’’Founder’‘.

He was appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) on 21 October 2008 after his predecessor, Abdul Hamid Mohamad, retired from office. Zaki, who was previously a practising lawyer, was directly appointed as a Federal Court judge on 5 September 2007—a first in Malaysian judicial history. Zaki is the son of former Lord President of the Federal Court Mohamed Azmi Mohamed. He was appointed as President of the Court of Appeal in December 2007. Zaki's appointment as a Federal Court judge has been criticised by the Opposition citing his swift ascendency, presence of more senior judges, and the fact that he was a legal adviser to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the major component party in the ruling coalition, just prior to his appointment as a judge. Background Early in his life, Zaki attended school in Sultan Abdul Hamid College in Alor Setar, furthering his studies at Anderson School in Ipoh and finally in English College Johore Bahru. =As Barrister and lawyer= Zaki became a Barrister through Lincoln's Inn in London, served at the Attorney General's Chambers from 1969 to 1970, and later served the subordinate courts from 1970 to 1973. In 1973, Zaki returned to the Attorney General's Chambers serving as a Federal Counsel and in 1976 he became a senior Federal Counsel under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Zaki was called to the Malayan Bar in 1983 and practised as a lawyer at Shahrizat Rashid & Lee beginning 1985. Zaki also served as a legal adviser to United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), where he was the party's Disciplinary Committee chairman and had served the party in other areas as well. =As Federal Court judge= On 5 September 2007, Zaki was appointed as Federal Court judge. Later on 11 December 2007 he became the President of the Court of Appeal of Malaysia. Zaki finally became Chief Justice on 21 October 2008, having served little more than a year in Malaysia's superior court system. His appointment as Federal Court judge as well as subsequent promotions has sparked concern by various segment of the public due to his close ties with UMNO. This concern became more apparent as he has only served the judiciary for less than 5 years in total. Zaki began his job by announcing that he would get tough and take action against errant judges to prevent the image of the judiciary from being tarnished. =Recent career= In 2018, Zaki Azmi was hired as the Chief Justice of Dubai International Financial Centre Courts. =Controversy= On 7 November 2008, Zaki Azmi made the announcement that two retired judges were suspected to be corrupt. He said he knew them personally but did not take action against them. Further to this, there has been strong links between Zaki and the government of Malaysia which would have signalled a conflict of interest should he become the Chief Justice of Malaysia. Recently, it was revealed that a company linked to former chief justice Zaki Azmi and UMNO lawyer Hafarizam Harun may have been given the concession for the Kinrara- Damansara Exchange (Kidex), a road project awarded by the government. The award of the contract was purportedly made by the government just before the CJ retired. His wife is the shareholder of the company that is said to have been awarded the lucrative contract valued at RM2.2 billion. Before his retirement in September 2011, the Judges' Remuneration Act (JRA) 1971 was amended to allow a chief justice, president or chief judge to claim for maximum pension after holding the office for more than three years. Previously, the provision required a chief justice to also serve a total of 10 years as a judge, out of which, three years must be spent holding the position of chief justice, president or chief judge. Opposition lawmaker Lim Kit Siang as well as some lawyers alleged that the amendment was made for the sole benefit of Zaki Azmi. Zaki had spent less than five years as a judge but more than three years in aggregate as president of the court of appeal and as chief justice.

Construction and commissioning Wando (Tug No. 17) was laid down on 14 June 1915 by the Charleston Navy Yard. Launched on 7 March 1916, she was commissioned on 3 April 1917 with Boatswain J. W. Bettens in command. First period in commission (1917-1922) Wando remained at the Charleston Navy Yard until 15 April 1917, when she got underway for New England waters and, with the ferryboat USS Wave (YFB-10) in tow, steamed north, via Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia and the New York Navy Yard in New York City, arriving at Newport, Rhode Island, on 21 April 1917. Shifting to Boston, Massachusetts via the Cape Cod Canal soon thereafter, she towed a coal barge to the New York Navy Yard on 25 April and 26 April 1917 and subsequently towed the scout cruiser USS Salem (CL-3) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the Boston Navy Yard before she returned, via Philadelphia, to the Charleston navy Yard on 19 May 1917, towing the torpedo boat USS Barney (TB-25). After brief tours of duty at Georgetown, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida, Wando sailed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, anchoring with the fleet in the York River on 11 June 1917. Through the summer of 1917, the tug performed various utility duties —mostly towing targets and lighters, shifting target rafts and planting buoys - operating out of Tangier Sound and Yorktown, Virginia. During that time, she assisted the grounded battleship USS Louisiana (Battleship No. 19) on 6 July 1917. In mid- August 1917, Wando underwent repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard and there received a \\"minesweeping outfit.\\" She departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 August 1917, heading for New York waters and reached \\"Base 10\\" — Port Jefferson, Long Island, New York — on the morning of 25 August 1917. From there she shifted to New London, Connecticut, where she received additional minesweeping gear from USS Baltimore (C-3) . On the evening of 8 September 1917, Wando embarked Captain Reginald R. Belknap, Commander, Mine Force and transported him to Newport, Rhode Island, arriving there later that evening. Wando subsequently performed buoy and net-tending functions off the Cornfield Light Vessel from 10 September 1917 to 13 September 1917. Wando returned to New London on 16 September 1917 and the following day had more minesweeping gear installed. She again transported Captain Belknap as a passenger, from New London to Newport, before heading for Norfolk. For the remainder of September, Wando operated at \\"Base One,\\" Tangier Sound, mooring target rafts, working on target moorings and making brief trips to the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs or supplies. Wando subsequently remained in the Chesapeake Bay-Hampton Roads-Tangier Sound region through the autumn months of 1917 and into the winter. Detached from her duty with the Mine Force on 19 November 1917, Wando resumed her operations with the Atlantic Fleet Train. However, she continued to perform the same basic duties, serving as target and net tender and delivering mail and dispatches through the end of March 1918. She subsequently towed targets for battleships engaging in gunnery exercises off the southern drill grounds, off the Virginia Capes and later laid buoys at the Potomac River Torpedo Range, off the mouth of the St. Mary's River. Wando deployed in the Caribbean for the first time in early 1919. Underway from Norfolk on 6 February 1919, she arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 14 February 1919, with Pontoon No. 23 in tow. She performed her unglamorous service functions for the Fleet — towing targets, lighters and barges and delivering men and mail — in Cuban waters at Guantanamo Bay, Guacanayabo Bay and Manzanillo Bay until 17 April 1919, when she headed back to the United States. Reaching New York on the 18 April 1919, Wando subsequently shifted to Hoboken, New Jersey, where she underwent repairs over the first few days of May 1919. Returning to Norfolk on 6 May 1919, Wando towed targets and performed general utility service with the Atlantic Fleet Train through mid-July 1919 and then operated in waters off the northern part of the United States East Coast out of Newport, New London and New York. She remained at New York City from 10 August 1919 to 10 January 1920. Underway for Norfolk on 10 January 1920, Wando arrived there the next day but, on 14 January 1920, sailed south for Charleston. which she reached on 16 January 1920. Detached from the Atlantic Fleet Train on 26 January 1920, Wando was simultaneously assigned duties as a yard craft at the Charleston Navy Yard, her crew reduced to 14 men. While on active duty at Charleston, she was classified AT-17 on 17 July 1920, during the fleet-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers. Wando operated in the 6th Naval District, out of the Charleston Navy Yard, until 18 April 1922, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. Second period in commission (1933-1946) Wando recommissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, on 15 March 1933. She was reclassified on 27 February 1936 from a seagoing tug (AT-17) to a harbor tug, YT-123. Assigned to the 13th Naval District after her recommissioning to operate at the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, Wando performed her vital but unsung tug services from the late 1930s through World War II. On 15 April 1944, she was reclassified again to a large harbor tug, YTB-123, a classification she carried for the remainder of her active naval service. Final decommissioning and sale Ultimately placed both out of service and out of commission and 3 July 1946, Wando was delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administrationfor disposal. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 30 December 1946 and she was acquired by the Puget Sound Tug and Barge Company on 28 April 1947.

The safety comes in two versions: original LAWKS and the Columbia River Knife & Tool company's patented AutoLAWKS. These additions raise manufacturing and engineering costs, but increase safety and security. Operation The original LAWKS mechanism consists of a switch on the handle of the knife, connected to the liner lock. When pulled back, the liner lock can easily be pushed back to close the knife. But when the safety switch is pushed forward, it acts as an extra lock ensuring the linerlock can not be used to close the knife, making the folding knife a virtual fixed-blade tool. The AutoLAWKS mechanism was designed after professional military/law enforcement consultants pointed out that sudden tactical or immediate operation situations would call for focus on something other than actuating a safety switch under duress. The AutoLAWKS automatically activates, as the knife is opened. To close the blade again, the user has to pull the switch back to free the liner lock like the original LAWKS, but the AutoLAWKS switch automatically returns to a neutral position.

The political party's ideology was libertarian. A group of former Libertarian Party (LP) members founded the party in 2006. They criticized the LP for its \\"abdication of political responsibilities\\", saying that \\"Americans deserve and desperately need a pro- freedom party that forcefully advocates libertarian solutions to the issues of today\\". The party effectively disbanded in July 2012.  Platform  The Boston Tea Party supported reducing the size, scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues and opposed increasing the size, scope and power of government at any level for any purpose.  Program and resolutions  The party's 2008–2010 program – the four points of Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty – advocated, among other things, the withdrawal of all American troops from around the world, including Korea, Japan, Europe and the entire Middle East; an immediate and complete end to warrantless searches and seizures, warrantless surveillance, and other practices that encroach on personal freedom; and an audit of the Federal Reserve. The program was deliberately adopted from Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty. On December 2, 2009, the national committee passed a spoon in Support of “Honest Money”. One week later Ron Paul introduced H.R. 4248: Free Competition in Currency Act of 2009, a bill 'To repeal the legal tender laws, to prohibit taxation on certain coins and bullion, and to repeal superfluous sections related to coinage.' The party's members adopted their 2010–2012 program at their online convention held in May 2010. Its five main points are 1) End the Wars of Aggression and withdraw US troops from around the world, 2) End the Federal Reserve Banking System, 3) End the War on Drugs, 4) End Abuses of Liberty such as the Patriot Act and Military Commissions Act, 5) End the Immigration Fiasco by eliminating government restrictions on human migration. The 2010 Boston Tea Party convention passed resolutions: calling for an independent investigation into the events of September 11, 2001; opposing intervention in Colombia; in support of the \\"Liberty Amendment\\"; and renouncing government in all forms. On July 5, 2010, the National Committee passed a resolution opposing \\"Top Two\\". On August 8, 2010, the National Committee passed a resolution to join the Coalition Against War Spending. On November 19, 2010, the Boston Tea Party National Committee passed resolutions; opposing the TSA, naked porno-scanners & enhanced pat-downs and supporting the 2nd & 9th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America. On February 4, 2011, the Boston Tea Party National Committee passed a resolution of support for the Tunisian and Egyptian people as well as the \\"rights of all peoples wishing to alter or abolish their present form of government.\\" On March 1, 2011, the Boston Tea Party National Committee passed a resolution supporting War Crimes trials “for every person that has violated the 'law of war'.” The BTP National Committee also passed a resolution condemning government censorship and any press organization and/or members of the media that intentionally distort and/or misrepresent facts. The final program adopted on May 2, 2012 read: \\"1. Monetary policy reform: Repeal legal tender law, allow for free competition of currency, and prohibit federal and state taxes on precious metal coins and bullion. 2\\\\. Real budgetary reform: Abolish all subsidies/entitlements, drastically cut military spending, cut salary of all federal employees (including elected and appointed officials) and liquidate all government assets other than necessary office buildings. 3\\\\. Pass the Downsize DC agenda of Congressional reforms: Read the Bills Act, One Subject at a Time Act, Write the Laws Act, and Enumerated Powers Act. 4\\\\. End the Wars Abroad: immediately cease all foreign intervention and bring home troops stationed abroad. 5\\\\. End the Wars at home: war on drugs, war on poverty, war on civil liberties.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120619000549/http://www.bostontea.us/program  History  The party was founded in objection to new policy changes by the Libertarian Party announced at its Oregon convention in 2006. In September 2008, the libertarian website LewRockwell.com posted an article by libertarian economist Walter Block. In it, Block proclaimed his preference for the Boston Tea Party's candidates over those of the LP. Block and other libertarians expressed discomfort over the \\"unlibertarian\\" history of the LP's 2008 presidential candidate, Bob Barr, a former Republican congressman. On the April 19, 2011, episode of Jeopardy! the BTP was a $2,000 clue in a category called \\"The Mad Tea Party\\". On July 22, 2012, Darryl Perry announced his resignation as chair of the party.Perry resignation As there were only two remaining members of the BTP National Committee at that time, Perry's resignation effectively disbanded the party. = Electoral history =  2008 presidential election  Charles Jay was the party's first presidential nominee. He received the BTP presidential nomination in the 2008 general election. He was on the ballot in Florida, Tennessee and Colorado and was a write-in candidate in more than ten other states. Thomas L. Knapp was the party's vice presidential nominee. Knapp was also a candidate for US Congress as a Libertarian Party candidate in the same election. However, alternate running mates included Marilyn Chambers (Arkansas, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah), Barry Hess (Arizona), Dan Sallis, Jr. (Colorado), John Wayne Smith (Florida) and Thomas J. Marino (Washington). In the 2008 presidential election, Jay received 2,422 votes, putting him in 15th place.  2012 presidential election  On December 23, 2011, after a two-day Presidential Nominating Convention which took place online and was open to all BTP members, Tiffany Briscoe of Maryland was chosen as the 2012 BTP presidential nominee on the first round of voting with 13 out of 20 votes. Kimberly Johnson Barrick of Arizona was chosen as the vice presidential nominee on the 2nd round of voting. On March 6, 2012, the party membership removed Briscoe as the BTP presidential nominee, replacing her with NOTA. On March 20, 2012, the party membership passed a motion to hold a new presidential nominating convention, which began on March 30, 2012. Jim Duensing of Nevada was nominated on the 4th round of balloting. Barrick remained the VP nominee. Ultimately, the BTP did not run a candidate in the general election as the party disbanded in July 2012.

The broad surface area of the \\"paddle\\" and the material from which it is made use friction to prevent the holster from being pulled up and away when the handgun is drawn. Advantages and disadvantages The primary benefit of this style of holster is that the entire holster and firearm may be removed from the wearer easily. Firearm wearers such as plainclothes detectives who frequently need to move between vehicles, offices, and field work may employ paddle holsters as they allow them to conveniently remove the holster and firearm when sitting and then just as easily replace it when needed. A typical handgun holster that attaches to the user via a belt does not offer the same flexibility requiring the user to remove his/her belt in order to remove the holster. This lack of dependence on a belt allows users the option of not even wearing a belt and still using a paddle holster. One disadvantage of the paddle holster is that its physical security is not as great as a holster secured with a belt as the paddle holster relies on the friction of the \\"paddle\\" to keep it in place. A second disadvantage is that paddle holsters tend to be larger in size which reduces the ability to conceal them easily. Options Options for the holster material are as varied as for any other holster and include plastic, nylon, and leather. Retention of the handgun in a paddle holster uses similar methods to other holsters such as adjustable tension devices and thumb break straps. Some paddle holsters have adjustable cant and tilt allowing the \\"paddle\\" to remain upright and shaped to the hip while the angle of the draw can be adjusted to suit the user's preference. Typically, the paddle holster has a ‘duck-bill’ spring-clip that slides over the wearer’s belt, or belt and pants together, to help secure the holster to the wearer. *Paddle Holster vs Belt Slide Holster Explaining the difference between a belt slide vs paddle holster.

Cockade (right) in 1951, with (left) and (centre) Cockade commissioned too late to see service in the Second World War. After the war she was allocated the pennant number D34. Her first commanding officer was Lt Cdr Terence Desmond Herrick, DSC RN. She served in the post-war Royal Navy, initially sailing to the Far East, exercising off Hong Kong in 1946. While on passage back to the UK from the Far East in December 1947, Cockade and sister ship were diverted to Aden in response to anti-Jewish rioting, with men from the two destroyers and the survey ship being landed to try to restore order. Cockade subsequently saw service in the Korean War, acting as escorts for the Royal Navy aircraft carriers and providing shore bombardment capability. Whilst there she also visited Singapore and Japan. In November 1956 Cockade was one of several Royal Navy ships to visit Melbourne, Australia for the 1956 Summer Olympics.

The younger Obama refers to her as \\"Aunti Zeituni\\" in his 1995 memoir, Dreams from My Father. In 2002 she had applied for political asylum in the United States but was denied. She became notable when her case was leaked in the final days of the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign in which Barack Obama was the Democratic candidate, attracting international media attention. In 2000, Onyango entered the United States on a temporary visa to accompany her son to college; she remained past its expiration date. In 2002 she sought political asylum in the United States, citing ethnic violence, as Kenya and East Africa had suffered an escalation in violence in the 2000s. Her case was denied in 2004. She remained in South Boston, Massachusetts, where she lived in public housing, and retained legal representation to try to gain asylum. Her case highlighted \\"the hot-button topic of illegal immigration\\" in a presidential race that had avoided it, as well as contradictory rules governing eligibility for public housing in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Department of Human Services investigated how her case was leaked. There was heightened federal administrative review on asylum deportations until after the 2008 general election. Onyango's case is often cited in light of immigration reform efforts of the Obama administration.\\"Bush admin. makes immigration strides in 2008\\" Early life and family Zeituni Onyango was born in 1952 into the Luo tribe in Kenya, daughter of Onyango Obama and his third wife Sarah Onyango Obama. She was a much younger half-sister to Barack Obama Sr., the son of their father's second wife. She was born during the British rule of the Protectorate of Kenya. Onyango became educated and worked as a computer programmer at Kenya Breweries in Nairobi. In 1988, she met her American half-nephew, Barack Obama, during his first trip to Kenya at the age of 27. He was meeting with his father's side of his family for the first time. His parents had separated when Obama was two, and his time afterward with his father was limited to a month's visit in Hawaii when the boy was 10.\\"Obama's extraordinary journey\\" Barack Obama Sr. remarried in Kenya and fathered about six children; he died in 1982. Obama's trip to Kenya was to meet and learn more about the many members of the paternal side of his family. At the time, Onyango gave Obama perspective on his father and his achievements, noting that, when Barack Sr. left Kenya for Hawaii in 1959 to go to college, he was the first in the family to travel by airplane and to study abroad. She also provided details about the complicated extended family from his father's four marriages (two of which were polygamous). Barack Obama Sr. fathered six sons and a daughter in addition to Obama. As of 2010, all but one live in Britain or the United States; Mark Obama Ndesandjo lives in China. After returning to Kenya with a master's degree from Harvard University, Barack Sr. became an economist in the government. He eventually rose to become senior economist in the Kenyan Ministry of Finance before political conflict with President Kenyatta destroyed his career. In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Barack Obama wrote about his journey to Kenya, including meeting Onyango, whom he called \\"Aunti Zeituni\\". =United States immigration status= Onyango visited the United States multiple times since 1975, returning to Kenya each time until the 2000s. She entered the US on a temporary visa in 2000 together with her son, who had been accepted at a college in Boston. Commercial databases show she received a Social Security card in 2001, indicating she had legal status as an immigrant at that time. By 2002, Onyango had already applied for political asylum when she applied for public housing in Boston. She moved into the apartment, run by Massachusetts authorities, after back surgery made walking difficult. A Boston Housing Authority official said that the agency was never notified that a deportation order had been issued against Onyango after the government denied her request for asylum. William McGonigle, deputy director of the Boston Housing Authority, said, \\"We have no affirmative responsibility I am aware of to further check on their [applicants'] status after they are initially deemed to be eligible.\\"(A 1977 federal consent decree, resulting from a class action lawsuit in Waltham, prohibits state officials from denying public housing to illegal immigrants). Beginning in 2003, Onyango lived in a South Boston public housing project, according to Boston Public Housing Authority (BHA) officials. William McGonigle said she served as a public health advocate on behalf of the BHA.\\"Obama's aunt 'in the US illegally'\\" Described as a frail woman who walked with a cane, Onyango had been granted a flat normally set aside for people facing physical hardship. As of 2008 Onyango worked as a volunteer computer systems co-ordinator for the Experience Corps, a program in which adults over age 55 mentor children in their communities. Margaret Wong, Onyango's immigration lawyer since 2008, said at the time the story broke that Onyango could be barred from reentering the US for up to ten years if she left the country.\\"Barack Obama's 'Auntie Zeituni' cannot walk, says lawyer\\" Wong said that Onyango needed to stay for medical care because she could not walk. In 2010 Onyango was granted political asylum. Interviewed in September 2010 following this action, she described having lived in a homeless shelter for two years in Boston while waiting for her public housing apartment. She said that she received disability checks of up to $700 a month. She did not apologize for overstaying her visa.Elias, Jonathan, \\"Aunt Zeituni: 'The System Took Advantage Of Me': President Obama's Aunt Speaks Exclusively With WBZ-TV\\" , WBZ-TV, Boston, September 21, 2010Ho, Vivian, \\"Obama's aunt says 'system' was at fault\\", The Boston Globe, 21 September 2010 =Political background in Kenya= In 2002 Onyango applied for political asylum in the United States citing violence in Kenya; a federal immigration judge eventually rejected the request and instructed her to leave the country. Joan Friedland, a lawyer and immigration policy director at the National Immigration Law Center in Washington, noted that even when an immigration judge makes such a decision, other options exist for an asylum claimant. Onyango, along with other Obama family members, was born into the Luo tribe, Kenya's third-largest (12%) ethnic group.\\"I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds\\"Gaston, Bruno, \\"'Nilotic' Link Places Obama's Roots in Southern Sudan\\", Redding News Review, Atlanta, September 3, 2008 Kenya had longstanding \\"ethnic tension between the Luo and Kikuyu\\"; the Kikuyu are the most populous tribe, accounting for approximately 22% of the country's people.CIA Factbook Retrieved October 16, 2007 Some of the tensions between the Luo and the Kikuyu date to the mid-1960s post- independence period, when a bitter falling out between the president (a Kikuyu) and his Vice President Jaramogi Odinga (a Luo) resulted in a \\"sustained political persecution of the Luo.\\" The Luo are considered one of Kenya's most marginalised groups. In 2002 the National Rainbow Coalition won political control of Kenya, but the country remained politically unstable. Electoral manipulation was alleged, and it was widely confirmed by international observers in the 2007 elections. The political fallout from the 2007 election resulted in a country-wide economic and humanitarian crisis extending into 2008. Throughout the 2000s, there had been widespread ethnic violence in Kenya and East Africa, including killings,\\"Kenya police in 'shoot to kill' row\\", Al Jazeera, 13 January 2008. and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people by 2008.\\"Kibaki offer on unity government\\", BBC News, January 5, 2008. Raila Odinga, Kenya's prime minister and former opposition leader in 2008, is also of the Luo tribe. The son of Jaramogi Odinga, he claims to be a cousin of Barack Obama.\\"Raila Odinga claims Obama is his cousin\\", BBC News, 1/8/08.\\"Some Kenyans forget crisis to root for Obama\\" , Reuters, 1/8/08. In 2008 Odinga served as Prime Minister of Kenya with president Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, in a coalition government. The American Prospect noted in 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and tortured in Kenya if she returned, and said that risk to her family members had increased, whether or not she was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police said that there was a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi. Immigration status Onyango's immigration status became the subject of widespread international media attention in the final week of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, in which her half-nephew Obama was the Democratic candidate. Based on anonymous government sources, Associated Press reported that Onyango was living in the United States without valid immigration status; she had been asked to leave in 2004 after her request for asylum was denied by an immigration judge. Although such an order from a judge can be appealed, it was unknown if Onyango had appealed the order. Onyango's case resulted in a special nationwide directive within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requiring any deportations to be approved at the level of ICE regional directors before the U.S presidential election. In discussing Onyango's case, various media outlets discussed some of the issues of immigrants, including political asylum cases. Putting Onyango's case in perspective, MSNBC's Domenico Montanaro noted at the time that thousands of people live for years in the US after receiving deportation orders. \\"Fugitive apprehension teams usually target suspects with criminal records before they go after simple immigration violators\\". Of an estimated ten million illegal immigrants, The Washington Post noted that an estimated 550,000 persons who have been denied asylum continue to reside in the United States.\\"Family storm aside, Barack Obama feels wind of change\\" Onyango was granted a waiver of deportation on May 17, 2010 by the United States, and became a legal resident. Immigration Judge Leonard I. Shapiro granted Zeituni Onyango, her lawyers Margaret Wong and Scott Bratton, and her two doctors an extended hearing that lasted five hours. At the end, Shapiro granted her legal residency and permission to work in the United States. =Political donation= Onyango donated money to her nephew's 2008 presidential campaign, but these were considered illegal under US law. Foreign citizens and/or immigrants without green cards may not make political donations. The campaign said they would return her donations, regardless of her status, to avoid any appearance of wrongdoing. =Legality regarding release of information= The Washington Post noted federal privacy law restricts the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from disclosing information about citizens and permanent residents, and DHS policy limits disclosures about an immigrant's status. Asylum seekers are granted greater protection from release of information to the public, because of the sensitive nature of their claims and the risks of retaliation. A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the Onyango case had been referred to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and its parent department's inspector general for investigation of the leak. \\"They are looking into whether there was a violation of policy in publicly disclosing individual case information\\", ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \\"We can't comment on individual cases.\\"  Publications  * (Autobiography) * Death Onyango died at a care home on April 7, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Seeheim is a settlement in the ǁKaras Region of southern Namibia. The only notable structures in Seeheim today are the hotel and the railway station; only a handful of people live there. Seeheim belongs to the Keetmanshoop Rural electoral constituency.  History  Seeheim was founded in 1896 as a base for the German Schutztruppe. Early in the 20th century its sole purpose was that of a junction station where the lines from Keetmanshoop diverted to Lüderitz and Karasburg. The line Keetmanshoop-Lüderitz was built from 1905 to 1908, the line Keetmanshoop-Karasburg in 1909. The First World War was the reason to build these railway links through inhospitable land. Soon however, transport demand peaked due to the diamond rush that developed after a railway worker picked up a diamond near Grasplatz station, 24 kilometers east of Lüderitz. People travelling from the inland to Lüderitz had to stay overnight at Seeheim junction. This was the reason for the erection of two hotels, one of which is again in operation today after standing empty for 30 years. In the 1950s, Seeheim was a settlement of considerable size. Afterwards, the town gradually fell into decline. The school closed down and the residents began to leave.  Transport  In 1974 the main road B2 was re-directed, leaving Seeheim in the middle of nowhere with only a small gravel access road, and the railway access. Seeheim station today is part of the Namibian Railways. The passenger line to Lüderitz has been defunct for many years because the rails were destroyed between Aus and Lüderitz. This missing section is currently being rebuilt. Until its estimated finish in 2010, the few irregular passenger trains to the West end in Aus.

He inherited the name Hiroshige II following the death in 1858 of his master Hiroshige, whose daughter he married. In 1865 he moved from Edo to Yokohama after dissolving his marriage and began using the name Kisai Risshō (喜斎立祥; alternate pronunciation: Ryūshō). His work so resembles that of his master that scholars have often confused them. Life and career The signatures of Hiroshige II - a) nidaime Hiroshige, b) Hiroshige ga, and c) Shigenobu ga Born Suzuki Chinpei () in 1826, it is said that he was born to a fireman, as was his master Hiroshige to whom he became apprenticed under the name Shigenobu at an unknown age. His earliest known work is the illustrations for a book called Twenty-four Paragons of Japan and China from 1849. Hiroshige II produced a large number of commissioned work in the 1850s in the style of the elder Hiroshige, and often signed his work Ichiryūsai mon (\\"student of Ichiryūsai\\", another art name of Hiroshige I's), and from to 1858 simply as Ichiryūsai. In 1858, he married Hiroshige I's daughter Otatsu after the master's death and inherited the Hiroshige name, as well as the names Ichiryūsai and Ryūsai. The artist moved from Edo to Yokohama in 1865 after dissolving his marriage and began using the name Kisai Risshō (喜斎立祥; alternate pronunciation: Ryūshō). During this decade he produced a number of collaborative print series, particularly with Kunisada, who had earlier worked with Hiroshige I. In his final years he turned mainly to decorating works intended for export, such as tea chests, kites, and lanterns. On 17 September 1869 he died at the age of 44. Hiroshige I took on few students; Hiroshige II was the most successful of these. His works have often been confounded with those of his master, which they resemble closely in style, subject, and signature. Early Western scholars did not even recognize him as a separate artist. Another pupil of the first Hiroshige, Shigemasa, later married the master's daughter, Otatsu, and also began using the name Hiroshige; this artist now is known as Hiroshige III.

History  The historical core of the law of unjust enrichment consists of the quasi- contractual actions of money had and received, money paid to the defendant's use, quantum meruit and quantum valebat. These personal common law actions generated an obligation on the part of the defendant to give restitution of a gain acquired at the expense of the plaintiff. This liability was strict and independent of any wrongdoing on the part of the recipient. Change of position provides a defence to a defendant where it would be inequitable to compel him or her to make restitution.

Her performances bring together a virtuosic command of her instrument, a penchant for improvising microtonal textures and melodies, and an array of percussive flute effects, all combined with electronic processing. These have distinguished her as “a pioneer in a wide array of new techniques”.Metzelaar 2004, 199. Many of her compositions involve her own participation, though she has produced works intended solely for other performers, usually involving guided improvisation and electronics. She is known for her use of texts that form part of her compositions and improvisations.Gilmore 2005. In addition to creating her own work, she regularly performs in other artists’ projects in a range of settings from modern chamber music to improvised electronic music. While pursuing PhD research at the University of California, San Diego in the mid-1980s she formed a duo with flutist John Fonville, commissioning new works and exploring extended techniques on flute, particularly with regard to microtonal scales. She moved to Amsterdam in 1989, where she has lived ever since. In 1999, together Steve Heather and Cor Fuhler, she founded Kraakgeluiden, a improvisation series based in Amsterdam, exploring combinations of acoustic instruments, electronic instruments and computers, and using real-time interactive performance systems.Metzelaar 2004, 199-200. Many of the musical collaborations that have resulted have taken on a life beyond the Kraakgeluiden series, which ceased in 2006. La Berge’s own music has evolved in parallel, and the flute has become only one element in a sound world that includes samples, synthesis, the use of spoken text and electronic processing. In 2006 - 2007 she collaborated with Dr. David LaBerge. This is a performance work based on Dr. La Berge's apical dendrite theory using film, narrative voice samples and music. She performs on a set of quarter tone (Kingma system) flutes. She can be heard on the New World Records, Z6 Records, Largo, Artifact, Etcetera, Hat Art, Frog Peak, Einstein, X-OR, Unsounds, Canal Street, Rambo, esc.rec., and Data labels which include recordings as a soloist and with Lukas Simonis, Ensemble Modern, United Noise Toys, Fonville/La Berge duo, Rasp/Hasp, Bievre/La Berge duo, Apricot My Lady, the Corkestra, MAZE and Joe Williamson. She is an active artist in Splendor Amsterdam, a collective of 50 musicians, composers and stage artists who have transformed an old bathhouse in the center of Amsterdam into a cultural mecca. Anne La Berge has regularly received funding from the Dutch Funds for Composers, the Funds for the Podium Arts and the Amsterdam Funds for the Arts. She is the co-director, with her husband David Dramm, of the Volsap Foundation. She also works as a freelance coach for the Amsterdam based Executive Performance Training company.

He was Head of the Centre for Historical Research at the National Museum of Australia from 2007–13. Between 1980 and 2007 he was an historian and sometime exhibition curator at the Australian War Memorial, including as head of the Historical Research Section and Principal Historian from 1987. He has written eight books about Australia and the Great War since 2005, and was a joint winner of the Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History in 2011. Early life and education Stanley was born in Liverpool, England on 28 October 1956 to Albert Edward Stanley and his wife Marjorie Patricia. The family emigrated to Australia in 1966 and settled in the South Australian city of Whyalla, where Stanley was educated at the local high school. In 1975, he relocated to Canberra to attend the Australian National University (ANU). After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1977, Stanley gained a Graduate Diploma of Education from the Canberra College of Advanced Education (now the University of Canberra), and initially embarked on a career as a secondary teacher; a decision he later termed a career \\"false start\\". He abandoned teaching to assume a position at the Australian War Memorial in 1980, and returned to the ANU to complete a Bachelor of Letters (1984) and a Doctor of Philosophy (1993). Stanley has been married to Claire Cruickshank since 2009. He has two daughters from a previous marriage to Mary-Ann Capel. Historical career Stanley has published over thirty books, mainly in Australian military history, with a strong bent towards social history. He has also written on the military history of British India, and has published a book on British surgery in the final decades of surgery before the introduction of anaesthesia, and on the effects of bushfire on an Australian community. His writing expresses his concern to integrate operational and social approaches within military history and relates in one way or another to the theme of human experience in extreme situations. His historical ventures also include leading the Memorial's Borneo battlefield tour, 1997; Commentator, ABC television broadcast of Anzac Day march, Sydney, 1998–2001; Historical advisor, television series Australians at War (Beyond Productions, 1999–2001); Commentator, Anzac Day national ceremony, Canberra, 2002–06; Leader, Australian War Memorial-Imperial War Museum Joint Study Tour to Crete and Egypt, Sep 2002; Presenter, Revealing Gallipoli, December Films, Apr 2005; Participant, National Summit on History Education, Canberra, Aug 2006; Commentator, ABC television broadcast national ceremony Anzac Day, Canberra, 2007–10. In 2008 he appeared in the documentaries Monash: the Forgotten Anzac and the 4 Corners report on The Great Great History War and Wain Fimeri's recent Charles Bean's Great War. In 2011 he participated in the Shine/Channel 9 series In Their Footsteps as an historical consultant and an on-screen presenter, and contributed to an episode of Who do you think you are? in 2013. Stanley has been a major participant in several public debates over history. He strongly contested the idea that there was a \\"Battle for Australia\\" in 1942, disagreeing opinions that events in Darwin in 1942 during the Second World War represented Japan's intention to invade Australia. He argues that the wartime slogan of a 'battle for Australia', used by John Curtin in February 1942 in anticipating invasion by Japan, was taken up in the mid-1990s and applied unjustifiably. These ideas he has developed in his 2008 book Invading Australia. As President of 'Honest History', he has criticised the excesses of the centenary of the Great War and the return toward 'Anzackery' in Australian commemoration. In his work at the National Museum of Australia Stanley wrote a book about the effects of the 2009 bushfires on a small rural community in Victoria, Black Saturday at Steels Creek (published in 2013 by Scribe Publications). Stanley also writes as a freelance author. One of his most recent military history books, surveying the Australian experience of the Great War, is told entirely through the lives and words of people called Smith or Schmidt – Digger Smith and Australia's Great War published by Murdoch/Pier 9 in October 2011. Stanley published Lost Boys of Anzac with NewSouth in 2014, and Die in battle: Do not Despair: Indians on Gallipoli, 1915 with Helion (UK) in 2015. He edited A Welch Calypso, Tom Stevens's memoir of his time in the West Indies in the early 1950s, also for Helion. Stanley writes historical fiction. His novel 'The Weight of Light', set in the islands in 1945 was accepted by Pandanus Press in 2014 – just before the publisher failed. Simpson's Donkey, a fictional book for children, was published by Murdoch/Pier 9 in 2011. His novel The Cunning Man (set in the first Anglo-Sikh War) was published by Bobbie Graham in 2014. He is working on a sequel, entitled 'Disenchantment'. In 2001, Stanley criticised the ABC Television mini-series Changi, claiming that the program was an in-accurate and misleading portrayal of the Second World War POW camp in Singapore. Bibliography Starting in 1977—and as at 2019—Stanley has written (or co- written) 27 books and edited eight others, published two novels and co- authored a booklet, and composed at least 46 chapters in books and anthologies, more than 60 journal articles, seven encyclopaedia entries and numerous papers. In 2011, his book Bad Characters: Sex, Crime, Mutiny, Murder and the Australian Imperial Force (2010) was the joint winner of the Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History.

Set in a fictional town called Namimori in modern Japan, the series' main protagonists are of Japanese descent. However, their connection to an Italian Mafia family results in a majority of other characters introduced being mainly of Italian descent, including most of its antagonists. The story centers on middle school student Tsunayoshi \\"Tsuna\\" Sawada, who finds out that he is the heir to the Vongola crime family. Reborn, the titular character and infant hitman, is sent to train him, and slowly recruits members into Tsuna's own Mafia family. They eventually attract attention from those who want to annihilate the future boss of the Vongola Family. Enemies such as the Kokuyo Gang, a group of Mafia criminals, and The Varia, an elite team of assassins, prove to be formidable challenges for Tsuna and his comrades. When some of the characters are later transported into an alternate future, nine years and ten months later, they have to adapt to a world where every Vongola member, as well as their allies, is being hunted down by a powerful rival family, the Millefiore. After returning from the future, they have to fight against an allied Family of Vongola since first generation who's seeking revenge to Vongola, Simon Family who turned out to be manipulated by Vongola Primo's Mist Guardian, Daemon Spade who intend to rebuild the Vongola that he desire. Later, Tsuna and the others participate in Representative Battle of the Rainbow under request from the Arcobaleno with the winner will be able to have his or her curse removed. However, things started to get worse once an Arcobaleno with a clear pacifier, Bermuda von Veckenschtein appears with his team and participate the Representative Battle in order to get his revenge on Checker Face at the cost of the Arcobaleno's lives.  Kokuyo Gang  Members of the Kokuyo Gang (from left to right): Twins (Jiji/Didi), Ken Joshima, Mukuro Rokudo, Chikusa Kakimoto, M.M. and Lancia. The Kokuyo Gang is a group led by Mukuro Rokudo, who formed the group after escaping from a special, high security jail in Italy which housed heinous criminals who have even committed crimes against the Mafia. Along with the two comrades he escaped with, Ken Joshima and Chikusa Kakimoto, he recruited other Mafia criminals who were able to break out from the same jail some time later. After their defeat at the hands of Tsuna and his friends, they were all once again imprisoned, though Chikusa and Ken are later able to escape, while Mukuro strikes a deal with the Vongola for their safety. = Mukuro Rokudo = is a 15-year-old Mafia criminal who escaped from an Italian prison, which held some of the most dangerous Mafia criminals, before he was to be executed. Not long after, he, along with his two subordinates, came to Japan, enrolled in Kokuyo Junior High, and started the Kokuyo Gang, which consists of heinous criminals who have recently escaped from prison. Skilled in casting illusions as well as mind control, he attempts to take his revenge on the Mafia by taking over Tsuna's body and using him to wreak havoc. When his plan fails due to Tsuna's interference, he is once again imprisoned. However, later on in the series, after possessing the body of Chrome Dokuro, he takes on a more supportive role for the series' main characters, though still prefers to not associate with them. He is voiced by Toshinobu Iida in the anime. =Ken Joshima= is a 14-year-old loyal friend and follower of Mukuro. Born on July 28, he was also experimented on by the Estraneo Family, and decided to follow Mukuro when the boy killed their captors. The experimentation on him resulted in his ability to gain the attributes of certain animals, like wolves and lions, when he changes to different sets of teeth, increasing his agility, strength, and senses. He was Chikusa's cellmate in jail and often calls him \\"Kakipi\\". He is defeated by Takeshi Yamamoto and later defeated once again by an injured Kyoya Hibari. He is taken away by the Vendicare, but later escapes.

He uses a pair of metal yo-yos that shoot poisonous needles as his primary weapons. After arriving in Namimori, he loses a battle against Hayato Gokudera, though finds out the identity of the tenth Vongola boss. Later, after sustaining further injuries by Kyoya Hibari, he is taken away and imprisoned by the Mafia's guardians, the Vendicare, along with the rest of the gang. He and Ken are able to successfully escape, with Mukuro ensuring their safety by striking a deal with Iemitsu Sawada. He returns for the Vongola Tournament, serving as a bodyguard for Chrome Dokuro, whose well-being is of concern to both him and Ken despite his open dislike for her. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Toyonaga in the anime. =Chrome Dokuro= Chrome Dokuro is a loyal 13-year-old vessel of Mukuro and one of the newest members of the gang. She is originally a girl named Nagi who was found by Mukuro when on the verge of death after her attempt to rescue a cat from traffic accident at the cost of her right eye and several of her organs. Mukuro allowed her to live by creating illusionary organs for her with his illusion, intertwining their existence. She became co-Mist Guardian of Vongola, fighting against Mammon in the Ring Conflict, which result on her lost until Mukuro switched place with her and defeats Mammon. A week after Mukuro's release from Vendicare prison, she was kicked out from the gang by Mukuro and begins living on her own in Namimori with Tsuna and his friends. The reason of her discard was revealed during the third day of Representative Battle; it was because of her own dilemma between wanting to be acknowledged as individual and wanting to keep living with Mukuro's illusionary organs, causing her health deteriorating. This left Mukuro no choice but to keep her at distance from him. However, she's able to overcome her dilemma and recreate her organs with her own power, defeating two Vindices with hers and Mukuro's combined power. As she and Mukuro shared one body, she's able to use two of Mukuro's six skills. However, once Mukuro was freed from Vendicare Prison, she can no longer use this ability. She used to use the same trident like Mukuro as her main weapon, but after she was discarded from the gang, the spikes of her trident reduced to one. She is voiced by Satomi Akesaka in the Anime. =M.M.= is a 15-year-old Mafia criminal who broke out of prison after Mukuro escaped. Born on July 3. She believes that money is the most important thing. After her defeat at the hands of Bianchi, she is later taken away by the Vendicare. Her weapon is a clarinet that is constructed like a microwave oven. When played, the clarinet creates special sound waves that cause atoms to vibrate at an incredible rate which results in the substance the clarinet is aimed at to boil instantly. She calls the attack Burning Vibrato. When in close range combat, her clarinet splits, becoming a pair of nunchaku. She is voiced by Shōko Ishii in the anime. =Lancia= is a 25-year-old Mafia criminal initially mistaken as Mukuro Rokudo. Born on December 15, as a child, he was adopted by the leader of a Mafia family in Northern Italy. The same family would later take in a young Mukuro, who periodically mind controls Lancia, and even makes him slay his entire family. Lancia eventually falls under Mukuro's complete control, losing his will to fight and forgetting his own name, and is soon captured and jailed. After Tsuna defeats him and Mukuro, he is freed from the latter's control, and is taken away by the Vendicare. He returns to Japan during the Vongola Tournament, defeating most members of the Varia's lower members, and being revealed as the strongest person in Northern Italy. Apparently, he became sensitive to Mukuro's thoughts due to being possessed by him so many times. He leaves for Italy after giving Tsuna his own family's ring. Lancia uses a giant steel ball and chain as his primary weapon, which he launches at the enemy using palm thrusts. Due to the ball's snake-like engravings on the surface, it can track and redirect air currents that create a vortex, sucking in whatever is near, and allowing Lancia to change its rotation in mid-air. He is voiced by Takeshi Maeda in the anime. =Birds= Birds is one of dangerous criminals that assisted Mukuro on finding Tsuna. He is accompanied by yellow birds that always followed him around and double as a signal to Mukuro if he was defeated.

He ordered the Bloody Twins to follow Kyoko and Haru and threatened Tsuna and his friends that they will kill them if they didn't listen to what he said. However, his plan was foiled due to Shamal, Future Lambo and I-Pin's interference, resulting with his defeat and he was later arrested.

However, they were defeated by Shamal and Future I-Pin who have been asked by Reborn to act as the two girls' bodyguards. They were arrested along with the other members afterwards.  The Varia  The Varia (from top to bottom): Gola Moska, Levi, Mammon, Xanxus, Lussuria, Squalo, and Bel. The Varia is the Vongola Family's elite, independent assassination team. They are composed of genius assassins who work in the deepest recesses of the Mafia. Each member takes on missions that are said to be impossible to accomplish by humans, however, they do not accept a mission unless they believe there is a 90% chance of success. Those that see them work often say that their high level assassination skills are demonic. Despite lacking loyalty and respect for other members, they are extremely loyal to their leader, Xanxus. The Varia also appear to have more than fifty subordinates ranged under the command of the main members. The Varia is apparently reclusive, only showing themselves after Iemitsu Sawada disappeared. During the alternate future arc, a 32-member Varia squad led by Xanxus attack a Millefiore base in Italy in accordance with the Vongola's plan to eliminate the Millefiore. Despite their fierce loyalty to the Vongola Family, the Varia only consider themselves as the Vongola IX's assassination team, still not acknowledging Tsuna to be the rightful Vongola X. =Xanxus= is the leader of the Varia and adopted son of the Vongola IX. For a long time, his mother convinced him that he was the son of Timoteo, Vongola IX, but after discovering that he was adopted, Xanxus develops a bitter hatred towards him. His anger only grew after discovering that him being outside the Vongola bloodline exempts him from claiming the title of Vongola boss, and that Tsuna was going to be appointed as the next boss instead. This inspires Xanxus to stage a coup d'etat, which came to be known as the \\"Cradle Affair\\", and is defeated by the IX. The incident left him with his trademark burns, and was frozen in ice for many years. After he awakens, he kidnaps the IX, places him within Gola Moska's armor, and uses the Vongola Tournament as a means to eliminate Tsuna's guardians and take control of the Vongola. His campaign comes to an end after being defeated by Tsuna, and the Vongola Rings rejecting him for not possessing Vongola blood. In the future, during the attack on the Millefiore, he defeats Sil and Olgelt with his animal box weapon containing a liger that possesses the Sky and Storm Flames. Xanxus possesses exemplary human strength and mental fortitude, but also possesses a particularly rare and destructive Deathperation Flame called the \\"Flame of Rage\\", which were once wielded by Vongola II. Xanxus also owns two guns, and can compress his flame into its bullets, utilizing the skill originally developed by Vongola VII to amplify their penetrative and destructive capability. He also grows in power from uncontrollable rage when his defeat by Tsuna is mentioned. He is voiced by Masanori Ikeda in the anime. =Superbi Squalo= is a gifted swordsman extremely loyal to Xanxus and also Dino's schoolmate from childhood. Squalo was actually the next candidate for Varia leadership, after defeating its leader Tyr. He had cut off his own left hand to better understand Tyr, who did not have a left hand. As such, Squalo has an artificial hand in its place which can flip into very severe angles, as to make up for his blind spots in sword-fighting. He submitted to Xanxus due to his \\"fury\\" and ambition, pledging to make Xanxus the next head of the Vongola Family. He battles and loses to Takeshi Yamamoto during the Vongola Tournament, and though he appears to be eaten by a shark, he had apparently been rescued by Dino in order to get Squalo to reveal information on Xanxus. In the future, Squalo and Belphegor appears in an encoded video for Tsuna and his family, warning them not to move from their current location and that instructions will be arriving shortly. In videos he sent to the adult Yamamoto for boasting rights and also as a way to draw the latter back to the sword, Squalo is shown to have continuously fought 101 battles in order to secure his title as the \\"Second Sword Emperor\\". He is later shown to be the battle commander during the attack against the Millefiore base in Italy. He wields Rain-Class flames and his special box unleashes a shark. He is voiced by Hiroki Takahashi in the anime. =Belphegor= , Belphegor is an assassin working for the Vongola's independent assassination squad, the Varia. He is known as \\"Prince the Ripper\\" (Purinzu za Rippa). Once a prince of an unknown country, at the age of eight, he stabbed his identical twin brother, Rasiel, presumably to death. It was later revealed during the Future Arc although he did stab his brother Rasiel, Rasiel still lived. Bel has a crescent-shaped birthmark on the right side of his stomach which mirrors Rasiel's. He is known as a battle genius, but his abilities only truly present themselves when he sees his own \\"royal\\" blood, which reminds him of the time he stabbed his brother. His eyes are never shown, but in Volume 24, Lussuria says in his interview that his eyes are both cool and loyal. In the future, during the Varia raid on a Millefiore base, he unleashes a storm-attribute mink from his special box. He is nicknamed Bel or Prince the Ripper. He is voiced by Yūki Fujiwara in the anime. =Lussuria= is a martial arts master whose favored style is Muay Thai. His knee is covered with a steel plate, making it ideal for defense, as well as deadly when used for offense. During the Vongola Tournament, he battles Ryohei in a brightly lit boxing ring, and initially has the advantage as he habitually wears sunglasses. After Ryohei destroys the lights and shatters his knee plate, the rest of the Varia assume his loss, and Gola Moska shoots him in the back, making him unable to continue the fight. Lussuria reappears during the tournament's final battle and is saved by Ryohei. In the future, along with retaining his combat abilities, he uses a special box that can unleash a sun- based peacock that can heal wounds while also accelerating a person's hair and nail growth. He is voiced by Kōichirō Yuzawa in the anime. =Leviathan= , known as 'Levi' for short, is an extremely loyal subordinate to Xanxus who cares little about promotions. It is said that his speed in accomplishing his work is the best in the Varia. He carries eight umbrellas which are each capable of discharging electricity. He battles Lambo during the Vongola Tournament, and though he had no problem defeating the 5 and 15-year-old Lambos, he is easily outmatched by the 25-year-old Lambo. After Lambo reverts to his 5-year-old self, Levi prepares to deliver the final blow to the unconscious Lambo, but Tsuna's intervention disqualifies Lambo. During the tournament's final battle, he is defeated by Gokudera. In the future, he is shown to unleash a lightning-based stingray from his special box during the raid on the Millefiore base. He is voiced by Yuto Nakano in the anime. =Mammon (Viper)= is an Arcobaleno whose real name is Viper. He owns the mist pacifier. Known as the Arcobaleno's best spellcaster, Viper has the ability to cast illusions, as well as being able to locate any person by sneezing into a piece of paper; the spit or mucus that sticks to the paper shows a map leading to the desired person. He also has a black frog named Fantasma that can give him the ability to fly in combat when it turns into a salamander. During the Vongola Tournament, he defeats Chrome, however, he is defeated by Mukuro once the latter takes possession of Chrome's body. He is said to be dead in the future, thus his position in the Varia has been replaced by Fran, who unwillingly wears a frog hat as homage. He is voiced by Rumi Shishido in the anime. =Gola Mosca= is a killing machine sold to the Varia on the black market by the Italian government, and is powered by the life of a human. It battles Hibari during the Vongola Tournament, but it is easily defeated with one strike. After it goes berserk, Tsuna destroys it by slicing it in half, revealing that Vongola IX has been unwillingly powering it. =Fran (Flan)= is the newest officer member of the Varia in the future who uses a Hell Ring with the numbers \\"666\\" imprinted on it. Introduced during the Varia attack on a Millefiore base in Italy, Fran is Mammon's replacement as the group's illusionist and is thus forced to wear a large frog hat to symbolize this. He is usually the target of Belphegors knives due to constant mocking. Although generally calm, Fran is openly antagonistic to the other Varia members on many occasions, mocking and verbally attacking them as they work. He later helps the Kokuyo Gang in freeing Mukuro Rokudo, his master, from his imprisonment. During the Representative Battle of the Rainbow, he was recruited and joined Mukuro's team. He is voiced by Kokuryu Sachi in the anime.  Millefiore Family  The is the Mafia family that is engaged in battle against the Vongola Family in the future. The Millefiore is a result of the merging of two separate Mafia families: the up-and-coming Family led by Byakuran, and the family with as much history as the Vongola, the led by Yuni. They are organized into two groups to distinguish their old families, which are then further separated into 18 different squads, each named for a plant or flower. Those originally from the Giglio Nero are the Black Spell and have the tendency to engage in direct combat, while those from the Gesso are the White Spell and specialize in cunning battle tactics. There appears to be animosity between members of the White Spell and the Black Spell, resulting in a lack of communication and sabotage by individual squads. Their organization also possesses the Mare Rings, a set of seven rings on par with the Vongola Rings originally belonging solely to the Giglio Nero. The holders of which, save the holder of the Sky, are known as the six Funeral Wreaths. =Byakuran= is the former boss of the Gesso Family, and the incumbent leader of the Millefiore Family whose aim is to obtain \\"ultimate power\\" Trinisette (7³) by gathering the Vongola Rings, Mare Rings, and Arcobaleno pacifiers together in one place; he has a portrait that has a slot for each item. To achieve his goals, Byakuran has ordered the complete extermination of the Vongola Family, even targeting their friends and allies. He also had special radiation released into the atmosphere in order to specifically kill all Arcobaleno members. Though he possesses the Sky Mare Ring, he has purposefully hidden his true abilities, and maintains a carefree attitude, even during his fight with Mukuro Rokudo, whom he critically injures. Despite his ruthlessness toward his enemies, he has a cheerful disposition when around his subordinates, especially toward Shoichi Irie, despite knowing of the latter's betrayal. According to Irie, Byakuran's power is the ability to share thoughts and experiences with versions of himself in all possible parallel worlds, giving him a power similar to omniscience, the ability to know everything. Byakuran's realization of his abilities was brought about when a young Irie continuously time-traveled into different futures and came in contact with two versions of Byakuran. His other selves have used this ability to become the dictator of their world, with the world the story is set in being the only one where he is not. However, his power is also weakening over time, which is why he needs Yuni, to replenish his abilities but in the end he is defeated and incinerated by Tsuna's flames. During Tsuna's original time, Byakuran is shown to be different from his future counterpart, healng Yamamoto's wounds, expressing his desire to protect Yuni out of sincerity, and assist Tsuna to defeat Team Bermuda, showing that he has truly becoming their ally. He is voiced by Takanori Ohyama in the anime. =Yuni= is a young girl who is the former leader of the Giglio Nero Family as a result of the early death of her mother, Aria, whom she did not know was a Mafia boss. She is known to be the daughter of Aria and the granddaughter of Luce, the original Sky Arcobaleno. She also inherited the orange Arcobaleno pacifier from her grandmother. Known as the \\"princess\\", Yuni was originally kindhearted and warm, and in order to prevent all out war with the Gesso Family, she started negotiations with their leader Byakuran. However, the latter forcefully drugged her during their private meeting. In addition to becoming cold and emotionally detached, the drug made her unable to speak up against Byakuran, resulting in the merger of their two families. She later regains her original personality, stating that she too has the power to travel to different worlds. When Byakuran denies her request for the Six Funeral Wreaths to have a rematch with the Vongola Guardians, she withdraws from the Millefiore Family and requests for Tsuna to protect her. She shows that she also has the other Arcobaleno pacifiers. According to Reborn, she is the Arcobaleno's boss.Amano, Akira (2009). \\"Target 254\\" (in Japanese). 家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ In the final battle with Byakuran, before he can complete the Trinisette, Yuni, along with Gamma, sacrifices herself in order to revive the Arcobaleno. During the Representative Battle of the Rainbow, the present Yuni once again becomes Arcobaleno, inheriting the title from her mother who decided to retire so Yuni will get the chance to be freed from her curse. She is now on friendly terms with Byakuran. She is voiced by Yoshino Nanjō in the anime. =Shoichi Irie= is initially an unsuspecting Japanese middle school kid who becomes caught up in the antics concerning Tsuna and his friends early on in the series, and ends up in possession of some Bovino family weaponry, including the Ten-Year Bazooka. However, in the story's alternate future story arc nearly ten years later, he is thought to be an enemy working for the Millefiore Family, but is in fact a spy for the Vongola. He is the captain of the White Spell's 2nd Rose Squad, and is also one of the Millefiore's six A rank members. He reports directly to Byakuran, and has been secretly researching the Ten-Year Bazooka in order to find a way to time travel. After confronting Tsuna and his friends, he reveals that he is on their side, with his past self being the one who has been bringing them into the future with the Ten-Year Bazooka, in accordance with a strategy that he, and adult Tsuna and Hibari have been planning. In the tournament against the Six Funeral Wreaths, he explains to Tsuna and the others of how his continuous attempts to change his future resulted in Byakuran realizing his powers; when a young Irie had time-traveled into the future twice, he had bumped into two versions of Byakuran, with the latter one remembering who Irie was despite never having bumped into him before (in that universe at least). Despite Irie's attempts to the change the future, his following trips all resulted in him seeing a ravaged world in which Byakuran was the dictator of the world. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Toyonaga in the anime. =Gamma= Gamma is an A ranked member of the Millefiore Family, who commands the 3rd attack squad of the Black Spell. According to Lal Mirch, Gamma is responsible for wiping out many of the allies of the Vongola Family. Gamma defeats Hayato Gokudera and Takeshi Yamamoto later interrogating Gokudera. Before Gamma killed them however, Kyoya Hibari arrived and defeated him. When Tsuna's group infiltrates their base, he runs into Gokudera and Ryohei. It is evident that he received a substantial power boost and succeeds defeating Ryohei. He and Gokudera then fight to a stalemate. He later returns to protect Yuni from the Real Six Funeral Wreathes and later both of them sacrifice themselves so the Arcobaleno can be reborn. It is revealed that Gamma has a deep hatred of Byakuran and members of the White Spell, believing that the former did something to Yuni that caused her to become who she is now. Gamma is the wielder of the Lightning Mare Ring that is later revealed to be a fake, and can use his lightning attribute flame to hover in the air as well as create electromagnetic barrier that can defend against attacks. He carries a billiard cue and a series of electrically charged billiard balls. Gamma also uses an animal box weapon, in the form of two foxes made of lightning, which can be enhanced using a third box. He is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in the anime. =Genkishi= , also known as the \\"Phantom Knight\\", is a Millefiore illusionist and swordsman, carrying four swords, as well as the Mist Mare Ring that is later revealed to be a fake and one of the six Hell Rings. He is sent to Japan by Byakuran in order to protect Shoichi Irie, so during the Vongola's raid on their base, he defeats Yamamoto and battles adult Hibari until the latter is replaced with their past self. It is revealed that despite being a former Giglio Nero member, he devoted himself to following Byakuran when he saved him from an incurable disease, and had even instigated the Giglio Nero/Gesso merger by faking his defeat at the hands of Squalo. However, when Byakuran had requested him to steal the Mare Rings and Sky Pacifier from the Giglio Nero, he was unable to do so due to Yuni. This leads him to go to great lengths to prove his loyalty to Byakuran, even being consumed by his Hell Ring, which changes him physically and mentally, in order to defeat Tsuna in battle. Though his transformation grants him greater power, he loses to Tsuna and escapes by using one of his box weapons. He resurfaces during the Vongolas' battle with the Six Funeral Wreaths disguised as Saru, one of Torikabuto's subordinate. There, he is defeated in a rematch with Yamamoto and killed off by Kikyo, under orders of Byakuran. He is voiced by Daisuke Hosomi in the anime. =Glo Xinia= is a captain of the White Spell's 8th Wisteria squad and is the holder of the Rain Mare Ring that is later revealed to be a fake. He encountered the younger Chrome Dokuro. He fights with a box of the rain element, an owl covered in the Dying Will Flame, later revealed to be playing host to Mukuro. After his battle with Chrome he was hospitalized with severe injuries and a broken jaw, but it is later discovered that he planted a tracking device on Chrome. He is voiced by Yoshihisa Kawahara in the anime. =Rasiel= is Belphegor's older twin brother and possesses the Storm Mare Ring that is later revealed to be a fake. He and Bel fought constantly as children, but he always won, so to beat him, Bel put laxatives in Sil's food to incapacitate him. Originally thought to have been killed by Bel, Sil reveals himself as the one responsible for the Millefiore defense in Italy, and uses a box weapon containing multiple bats that emit invisible storm flames to assault his enemies in battle. His personality is no different from Bel's, except that he states that he is a king rather than a prince. He is accompanied by his family's former butler, Olgelt, who claims to only follow the one who would be king and can unleash elephants from multiple boxes. He is voiced by Ryuji Kamiyama in the anime. =Ginger Bread= Though primarily known as within the story, he claims that he no longer goes by that name. He is also known as the Magician's Doll, primarily due to his usage of similar looking dolls that are clothed in a wizard's hat and cape, and have stars in their eyes, to fight. In addition, he uses spiders, summoned by what he calls sorcery. He is the vice-captain of the Millefiore's eighth squad, and claims to have had a hand in the death of Colonnello. As such, Lal Mirch engages him in battle, but after he loses, it is revealed that she was only fighting one of his dolls. Another one of his dolls, paired with another Millefiore member, Iris Yoka, and her Death Stalk squad, shows up soon after to incapacitate Tsuna and Spanner, but it is then defeated by the former. Later, it's revealed that he's actually dolls created by a Vindice, Alejandro to destroy families from within. He is voiced by Yumiko Kobayashi in the anime. =Spanner= is a member of the Black Spell. He belongs to the family's tech department and is responsible for the creation of the family's Moska robots, which are giant humanoid robots created for combat. He was told by Irie to locate and eliminate Tsuna. After Tsuna defeats King Moska, Spanner takes the unconscious Tsuna back to his workroom where he manages to perfect Tsuna's X Burner, as he wished to see its full power. He does so by inventing a pair of contact lens for Tsuna that allows him to regulate the power output level of each glove while using the X Burner. He is considered to be a traitor to the Millefiore and joins Tsuna's family. He later takes part in the tournament against the Six Funeral Wreaths. He is voiced by Kenjirō Tsuda in the anime. =Real 6 Funeral Wreaths= Byakuran with the Real 6 Funeral Wreaths excluding Ghost (from left to right): Daisy, Zakuro, Byakuran, Kikyō, Bluebell, and Torikabuto. The are Byakuran's six strongest subordinates, and are thus in possession of the Mare Rings, the Millefiore's top class rings that are said to be on par with the power of the Vongola Rings, and are a corner of the Trinisette policy. At first, it was thought that Shoichi Irie, Gamma, Genkishi, Glo Xinia, and Rasiel were part of the six as they supposedly possessed Mare Rings, but Byakuran reveals that the rings that they possess are fake; he hid the true identities of the real Funeral Wreaths as he suspected Shoichi's betrayal. The known members are , the rough-looking Storm Funeral Wreath, his Carnage Box transforms him into part T-Rex; , (voiced by Kazuki Kato in the anime) the ruthless Cloud Funeral Wreath and leader of the real Funeral Wreaths; his Carnage Box transforms him into part-Spinosaurus;, the Millefiore's immortal sun guardian who possesses facial scars and is apparently obsessed with slaughter, his Carnage Box transforms him into part-lizard; , a young girl who is the Rain Funeral Wreath and is able to dissolve into water, her Carnage Box transforms her into part- Shonisaurus; , the Mist Funeral Wreath and a colossal figure who utilizes multiple flame elements and illusions in battle, his Carnage Box transforms him into a disgusting merge of human and moth; and , the Lightning Funeral Wreath who is in fact a parallel double of Byakuran himself, able to absorb flames from nearby sources due to his unique composition. All of the members (excluding Ghost) shown so far have displayed a number of shared traits: they use box weapons containing prehistoric beings such as dinosaurs as opposed to regular animals, they have their box weapons embedded in their bodies to maximize their fighting ability, and they use their Dying Will flames as projectiles in combat when their box weapons are dormant. An interesting point about Bluebell and Zakuro is that their hair colour matches their flame colour. Simon Family The Simon Family is a Mafia group that has been allies with the Vongola since Giotto's time, but has grown weak over the years. Seven of its members transfer into Namimori Middle School in order to attend Tsuna's inheritance ceremony. These members are Shitt P., Adelheid Suzuki, Kaoru Mizuno, Rauji Ōyama, Kōyō Aoba, Julie Katōu, and the tenth Simon boss, Enma Kozato. Their true motive is to take revenge on the Vongola, who supposedly betrayed the Simon Family during the first generations' time. Their power comes from the Simon Rings, which are fully activated by Vongola's Sin, a vial which is said to contain the blood of the first Simon boss, Cozzato Shimon. Their rings use Flames of the Earth as opposed to Vongola's Flames of the Sky. Tsuna and his friends face the Simon in battles which they stake their pride and the loser is imprisoned in Vindice forever. It is later revealed that the Simon Family was being manipulated by Vongola Primo's Mist Guardian, Daemon Spade, who plans to take possession of Mukuro Rokudo's body and rebuild the Vongola family in his image. After Daemon was defeated, Simon Family reconciled their bond with Vongola. =Enma Kozato= is the leader of the Simon Family and a descendant of the first Simon boss, Cozzato. When he is introduced, he is shown as a similarly pathetic young boy to Tsuna. Enma had some concerns about whether to go through with the plan to overthrow Vongola, but eventually decides to do so after Tsuna unknowingly fails a test he had set up. After throwing away his concerns, they attack the Vongola Inheritance Ceremony and steals Vongola's Sin, using it to enhance their Simon Rings and destroy the Vongola Rings. Aside from the Simon's pride, he has a personal grudge against Tsuna since his parents and sister were apparently killed by Tsuna's father, Iemitsu. He is brought to insanity due to Daemon Spade's manipulation, but he is saved by Tsuna who gets through to him. Despite being declared the loser by Vindice, he is allowed to stay to watch the final battle between Daemon Spade and Mukuro Rokudo. After the final battle with Daemon, he and his Family peacefully live their normal lives along with Tsuna and his Family in Namimori. His Simon Ring gives him the ability to control gravity, allowing him to produce powerful black holes. =Koyo Aoba= is the Simon Guardian of the Forest. He has incredible vision which allows him to pinpoint flowing weak points in his opponent's body and exploit them. However, this vision causes great stress which can eventually lead to blindness, so he usually wears a special pair of pitch-black glasses. He battles against Ryohei in a boxing match which ends in a tie, and both he and Ryohei are imprisoned by Vindice. After final battle against Daemon, he, and the other Simon Guardians are freed and reconciled with Vongola. He possesses similar traits to Ryohei and even has a catchphrase, which is, \\"in the end\\". =Rauji Ōyama= is the Simon Guardian of the Mountain who gives off the impression of liking kids, not minding Lambo bossing him around all the time. In the battle against Vongola, he's shown to be ruthless towards Lambo and even challenged the child to a sumo match, though he was defeated by 15 year-old Lambo and imprisoned by Vindice. Rauji claims to follow Enma because he has strong eyes. After the final battle against Daemon, he, and the imprisoned Simon Guardians are freed from the Vindice and he reconciled with Lambo. His Simon Ring forms volcanic rocks which form horns like a stag beetle that anchor his legs to the ground. =Adelheid Suzuki= is the Simon Guardian of the Glacier who has a no-nonsense demeanor and uses metal fans as weapons. She is deeply devoted to Enma and the Simon. Adelheid was head of the Liquidation Committee in Simon Middle School, and fights with Hibari after she decides that the order of the Disciplinary Committee is no longer needed and that her Liquidation Committee should replace it. She later loses to him during a duel on the Simon Island. After the final battle against Daemon, she, and the other Simon Guardians are freed and she later continue her role as the head of Liquidation Committee in Namimori Middle School. Like Hibari, Adelheid uses force to get what she wants. Her Simon Ring allows her to freeze massive bodies of water. =Shitt P.= is the Simon Guardian of the Swamp. She has a single patch of hair on her forehead and is always seen wearing two large inflatable rings around herself, prompting Gokudera to label her an \\"UMA\\" (Unidentified Mysterious Animal). Her pride is fighting for herself, and she mocks Gokudera's dedication to Tsuna on the basis of Tsuna's poor academic and athletic abilities. Her ring flames allow her to break down any inorganic substance into a swamp-like pit. She challenges Gokudera into a battle in which they must pop the other person's balloons. Gokudera ends up as the winner leaving her to be taken away. After the final battle against Daemon, she, and the other Simon Guardians are freed and reconciled with Vongola. She developed fondness for Gokudera and began to stalk him ever since, much to Gokudera's dismay. =Kaoru Mizuno= is a Simon Guardian who sports a pompadour. He is initially shown to be a shy person interested in sports. However, upon Yamamoto's discovery of his ring wrapped in paper with the Vongola emblem crossed out, he attacked Yamamoto, resulting in Yamamoto getting hospitalized. When he later learns of Daemon Spade's manipulation of the Shimon family, he battles against him but is easily outmatched and imprisoned along with Adelheid because he no longer has any capability to fight the Vongola. After the final battle against Daemon, he, and the other Simon Guardians are freed, and he reconciled with Yamamoto. His Shimon Ring allows him to form a powerful drill around his arm. =Julie Katō= is the Simon Guardian of the Desert, who takes a keen interest in Chrome and constantly pushes Enma's to carry out the fight. In reality, he is actually possessed by Vongola Primo's Mist Guardian. After Daemon seemingly defeated by Mukuro, Julie was freed from Daemon's possession without any memories of what are happening. He was sent to the illusionary world along with Gokudera, Yamamoto, Lambo, and Hibari by Daemon and was trapped there until Tsuna defeated Daemon. After the final battle against Daemon, he and his Family lives peacefully with Vongola. Individual =Daemon Spade= is the Vongola Primo's Mist Guardian. He used to be an aristocrat who hated his own status for he had no social standing in public. He joined Vongola after his lover, Elena, introduced him to Vongola Primo and dedicated himself to the Family. However, after Elena's death due to Primo's reckless decision to throw away his military forces, leaving Vongola territory open to attack, Daemon changed and decided to make Vongola a Family that everyone was afraid of and despised to prevent the same thing from happening again. He betrayed Primo since he believed that the latter was no longer capable being the boss, deeming him far too soft. He set a trap for Cozart Simon in the past and using Julie Katō's body, arranged the present battle between Vongola and Simon so he could destroy the Vongola and rebuild it in his image. During Tsuna's inheritance ceremony, he kidnapped Chrome and controlled her mind in order to lure out Mukuro so he could take over his body. Though he is seemingly defeated by Mukuro, Daemon turned out to be using the opportunity to possess Mukuro's soulless body in the Vendicare's prison before Mukuro did. In the final battle with Tsuna, he was defeated by Tsuna who had acquired Flame of Oath, mortally wounding him in the process. As he was dying, he dropped his pocket watch that picked up by Tsuna, revealing it contains old photograph of himself with the Vongola Primo Family and Elena. At this time he finally revealed his past and his motives behind his entire action for all those years; all for Elena's sake. After knowing this, Tsuna, not wanting Daemon to die while still bearing hatred and regret, lied as he assured him that Elena is grateful and knew that he'd never forgot her using his Vongola intuition, making Daemon whole-heartedly accept his fate despite knowing that Tsuna was lying about Vongola Hyper Intuition. Afterwards, he dies, finally at peace as he accepted Tsuna and his Family, entrusting Vongola in their hands. By acquiring Mukuro's body, he obtained all the six Simon Earth rings, excluding Enma's that allows him to use all the abilities of the Simon family along with the special eight attribute Flame, Flame of Night that Vendice use that far exceeding his previous power to the point where Mukuro stated that he's no longer a human but a monster. In anime, Daemon was voiced by Atsushi Kousaka. Vindice Vindice are the masked keepers of Mafia law who punish those who cannot be judge by normal law. Those who defy their law are arrested without any hesitation and imprisoned in inescapable prison known as Vendicare Prison. The Vindice has been around for as long as the Mafia exist. Their reputation among Mafia world precedes them, as they are said to show no mercy even to devils. They are said to have no emotions other than hatred. They possesses the Flame of Night that governs by a set of law that allows them to transport anywhere they want. The Vindice are revealed to be the previous Arcobaleno who were in the past, tricked and cursed by Checker Face. They, who had their Pacifier removed from them were mostly dead and even the ones who managed to survive had a cursed lives afterwards that only desiring for revenge, making them the way they are now. All the Vindice, aside from Bermuda, are unable to create their own flames and merely survived by the flames provided by Bermuda. After they were defeated by Tsuna and his friends, they agreed to protect the Tri-ni-set for eternity that had been place in jars specifically created by Talbot with Bermuda's Flame of Night as support to prevent another generations of Arcobaleno. =Bermuda von Veckenschtein= A mysterious Arcobaleno and the founder of Vindice organization with clear pacifier who first appeared alongside Jager in front of Giotto, Cozart Shimon, and G., becoming focal point of the oath made by both Giotto and Cozart. He later reappeared alongside seven Vindices at the second day of Representative Battle and officially participate the battle after defeating Team Skull and steal their watches with his team. He is said to be once the absolute strongest Arcobaleno until certain incident and due to a little blunder, he is under the same curse as the other Arcobaleno. Like other Vindice, he was an Arcobaleno who was tricked and cursed by Checker Face. However, when Checker Face tried to remove his flame from his pacifier, Bermuda resisted and able to survive by filling his pacifier with a new flame, Flame of Night and through generations, recruiting those who experience the same fate as him and taught them how to use the flame. He created the Vindice in order to keep watch the Tri-ni-set in hope he able to track Checker Face who administrates it. He plans to kill Checker Face to achieve his revenge by winning the Representative Battle, at cost of the Vindice and the current Arcobaleno's lives. After defeated by Tsuna, he and the Vindice agreed to protect the Tri- ni-set with his flames to take control over it, away from Checker Face, as well as in order to prevent another generation Arcobaleno to be born ever again. Being the founder of the Flame of Night and formerly the strongest Arcobaleno, Bermuda is a powerful fighter with the ability to short warp an infinite number of times, strong enough to corner Reborn in his adult form. =Jager= Bermuda's partner who always appeared alongside the latter. He also witnessed the oath made by Giotto and Cozart. He reappeared again when Daemon able to break out from Vendicare water prison and promised both Tsuna and Enma that he will free Ryohei and Shimon Guardians who were imprisoned in their prison if they able to defeat Daemon. During the Representative of the Rainbow, he and his team joined the battle as Bermuda's Representative with him as the Boss. According to Bermuda, he is the strongest Vindice warrior, able to overpower Tsuna in a matter of seconds as well as Squalo, Xanxus, and Byakuran. Even Reborn himself made it clear that Tsuna won't stand a chance against him and couldn't see any possibility for him to win against him in any way. During the fourth day of Representative Battle, however, he was defeated by Tsuna and his remaining team members' cooperation. =Jack= One of the Vindice who partake the Representative Battle of the Rainbow as part of Team Bermuda. During the third day of Representative Battle, he appears with other two Vindices in front of Tsuna's and Mukuro's team, which resulting a temporary alliance between the two. During the battle, he was the one who indicated that they are not human being. He is defeated by Tsuna shortly after his other two teammates were defeated by Mukuro and Chrome. =Alejandro= One of the Vindice who partake the Representative Battle of the Rainbow as part of Team Bermuda. He has been in Vindice almost around the same time as Bermuda. During his fight with Tsuna, Enma, and Basil, it's revealed that he's the creator of Ginger Bread puppets to destroy Families from within, referring them as his children. His battler watch was destroyed by Tsuna after his attention was distracted when witnessing his Ginger Bread puppets' defeat by Tsuna, Enma, and Basil's combination, disqualifying him from the Representative Battle. =Small Gia= One of the Vindice who partake the Representative Battle of the Rainbow as part of Team Bermuda. He, along with Big Pino ambushed Team Verde's decoy puppets and then fought illusions created by Chrome and Flan with Gokudera and Yamamoto mixed among them to buy times until Tsuna, Enma, and Basil arrives. He was able to locate Chrome's and Flan's illusions and almost had Big Pino kill them, but Tsuna, Enma, and Basil arrive in time to save them. He uses weapons that carried by Big Pino and able to switch them whenever he wanted. Unlike other Vindice in common, he's rather expressive, showing clearly his joy and emotions even though Jager has once said that Vindice has no emotion other than hatred. He is also sadistic, stating that his hobby is slaughtering. He seemed to be the only one able to understand Big Pino's words. He and Big Pino was defeated when Yamamoto restrained him while his movements were stopped by Enma's manipulation and Chrome and Flan protected him and Gokudera with their illusions right before the dynamites that Yamamoto was holding explode, destroying his battler watch. =Big Pino= One of the Vindice who partake the Representative Battle of the Rainbow as part of Team Bermuda. He, along with Small Gia ambushed Team Verde's decoy puppets and then fought illusions created by Chrome and Flan with Gokudera and Yamamoto mixed among them to buy times until Tsuna, Enma, and Basil arrives. He's powerful enough to destroy Gokudera's Sistema C.A.I and Yamamoto's swords, and nearly killed them if only Tsuna, Enma, and Basil didn't arrive on time to stop them. Aside from his cannon, he carries various weapons with him behind his coat that used by Small Gia. Unlike other Vindice, he's unable to talk and can only say \\"pipipupo\\" that only Small Gia could understand. He and Small Gia was defeated when Gokudera distracts and able to reach his arm near enough to his battler watch while Enma stopped his movements and Chrome and Flan protected him and Yamamoto's bodies with their illusions right before the dynamites that Gokudera was holding explode, destroying his battler watch.  Reception  Due to not having any recurring antagonists or villains in the first seven volumes, the series was initially termed to be an \\"episodic comedy series,\\" with even the would-be killers turning out to be good guys. The series introduces its first set of recurring villains in volume eight. Still, Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin points out that despite Tsuna and company facing the \\"biggest threat\\" they have ever faced, the series retains its comedic factor; describing the villains as \\"really strange adversaries – Naruto meets the defunct FOX TV comedy, Arrested Development.\\" In IGN's review of volume nine, A.E. Sparrow describes the new villains as the \\"super-powered cadre of bad guys,\\" with Manga Life's David Rasmussen commenting that Mukuro is an evil being. References Reborn!

He started the construction of large tanks or reservoirs in Sri Lanka, and built sixteen such tanks. After becoming king, Mahasen discriminated the Theravada Buddhists in the country, and destroyed several temples including Mahavihara (the main Theravada temple) before his chief minister led him to realise his mistakes. The Jethavana stupa was also built by Mahasen. His countrymen regarded him as a god or deity after the construction of the Minneriya tank, and he was named Minneri Deviyo (God of Minneriya). Discrimination against Theravada Buddhism Mahasen was the younger son of King Gotabaya, who ruled the country from 253 to 266. His elder brother and predecessor to the throne was King Jetthatissa, who was the king from 266 to 275. Mahasen and Jetthatissa were educated by a Buddhist monk named Sanghamitta, who was a follower of the Vaitulya doctrine. Mahasen also became a follower of this doctrine, which was associated with Mahayana Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism was traditionally the official religion of the country. However when Mahasen acquired the throne, he ordered the Bhikkhus of Mahavihara, the largest Theravada temple in the country, to accept Mahayana teachings. When they refused, Mahasen prohibited his countrymen from providing food to the Theravada Bhikkhus, and established a fine for violating this. As a result, the Buddhist monks abandoned Anuradhapura and went to the Ruhuna municipality in the South of the country. Mahasen destroyed the Mahavihara, and the materials obtained from there were used for building the Jethavanaramaya. Lovamahapaya, which belonged to the Mahavihara, was also destroyed. After this incident, the king’s chief minister and friend, Meghavannabaya, rebelled and raised an army in Ruhuna against him. The king came with his army to defeat Meghavannabaya and camped opposite the rebel camp. On the night before the battle was to be fought, Meghavannabaya managed to enter Mahasen’s camp and convinced him to stop the violence against Theravada Buddhists. Mahasen agreed to stop the violence and made peace with Meghavannabaya, and later reconstructed the Mahavihara. Constructions The Jethavana stupa The Jethavana stupa was built by Mahasen in the land belonging to Mahavihara. This is the highest stupa in Sri Lanka, and is among the tallest in the world. It is also the largest brick building ever built. He also built other temples such as Gokanna, Minneriya and Kalandaka. The Mahavamsa, chronicle of Sri Lanka, states that Mahasen constructed sixteen large tanks and two irrigation canals. The largest among these is the Minneriya tank, which covers an area of . The tank has a circumference of , and its high bund is long. The Minneriya tank provides water for a large area, and its water supply is maintained by the Elahara canal. Henry Ward, a governor of Sri Lanka when it was a British crown colony, had stated; > No wisdom and no power in the ruler can have forced such efforts even upon > the most passive oriental nations, without general persuasion that the work > was one of paramount necessity and that all would participate in its > benefits The sixteen tanks given in the Mahavamsa as built by Mahasen are as follows. Some of these tanks have been identified, and the present names of the ones that have been identified are given in brackets. *Manihira (Minneriya) *Mahagama *Challura *Khanu *Mahamani *Kokavata *Dhammarama *Kumbalaka *Vahana *Ratmalakandaka (පදවිය) *Tissavadamanaka (කවුඩුල්ල) *Velangavitthi *Mahagallaka. (මහගල්කඩවක) *Cira *Mahadaragallaka (නාච්චදුව) *Kalapasana In addition to these, Mahasen also built the canal Pabbathantha ela, and also completed the canal Elahara ela, which was started by King Vasabha. Relations with the countrymen During Mahasen’s anti-Theravada campaign, his countrymen turned against him and this opposition even led to rebellions against him. Even the Commander of his army Meghavarnabaya turned against him. These led to the killing of several royal officials, including the monk Sanghamitta, the teacher of the king who led him to this campaign. However, after Mahasen reconstructed the Mahavihara and constructed and repaired several tanks in order to improve agriculture in the country, the people’s opposition toward him was reduced. After the construction of the Minneriya reservoir, Mahasen was regarded as a god or deity, and was called Minneri Deviyo (God of Minneriya). After his death, a shrine was built for him near the Minneriya reservoir, the remains of which can be seen to this day. Mahasen died in 301, and with his death, the Mahavamsa written by the Buddhist Monk Mahanama also ends.

The clan is without a chief that is recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms; therefore it can be considered an armigerous clan. The clan takes its name from the lands of Innes in Moray, Scotland. Additionally, to avoid confusion - Clan Innes is not associated with Clan MacInnes which hails from Argyle and the western Isles. Clan Innes claims descent from a Berowald, a Flemish knight, who was given the lands of Innes by Malcolm IV of Scotland in 1160. Berowald's grandson, Walter, assumed the surname Innes and was granted a charter of confirmation by Alexander II of Scotland in 1226. In 1452, Robert Innes, the eleventh laird, fought under the Earl of Huntly at the Battle of Brechin. He later founded the Greyfriars of Elgin in an attempt to repay for his sins. The twentieth chief of Clan Innes, Sir Robert, was a Member of Parliament for Moray and was made a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1625. The third baronet, Sir James, married Lady Margaret Ker (whom through the sixth baronet inherited the Ker dukedom of Roxburghe. The twenty-fifth chief (and sixth baronet), Sir James Innes, claimed the dukedom of Roxburghe in 1805 when the previous duke died without a direct heir. Later, in 1812 the House of Lords ruled in favour of Sir James, rejecting claims by the heir female of the second earl and heir male whatsoever of the first earl. Because of the ruling Sir James took the surname Innes-Ker and was titled James Innes-Ker, 5th Duke of Roxburghe. The present duke of Roxburghe is heir to the chiefship of the clan, however since he bears the surname Innes-Ker the Lord Lyon King of Arms will not recognise him as chief of the name Innes. The crest badge suitable for clan members to wear contains the heraldic crest of a boar's head erased Proper, and the heraldic motto of BE TRAIST. Tartans Clan Innes has two historical tartans, They are called \\"Innes Red\\" and \\"Innes Hunting\\", Innes Red is the first Tartan discovered, However, there are many variations of the Innes Red, The most known version is titled in the Scottish Register of Tartans as \\"Innes (Of Moray)\\" other versions are called \\"Innes (D C Stewart)\\" and \\"Innes\\" the one most commonly used is \\"Innes (of Moray)\\" The Innes Hunting tartan is the newest found tartan, It was registered on the Scottish Register of Tartans by Colin Innes of Tulchan with agreement of The Duke of Roxburghe in the Lyon Court Books 19, April, 1969. It is identical to the \\"Innes (miniature)\\" tartan taken from a miniature of Georgina Innes at Edingight. There are many other Tartans registered to Clan Innes, These include \\"Innes of Cowie\\", \\"Innes Dress\\" and \\"Innes Red, Dress (Dance)\\".
