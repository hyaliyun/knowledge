Medical career  Born in Newington, Edinburgh, Crichton received his M.D. from Leyden, Holland, in 1785. He developed his medical skills through studies at Paris, Stuttgart, Vienna, and Halle. He returned to London in 1789, becoming MRCS but by 1791 he had moved from surgery, becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1793, holding the post of physician at Westminster Hospital between 1794 and 1801. In 1803, Crichton was invited to become the emperor of Russia's personal physician, and between 1804 and 1819 was appointed Physician in Ordinary (personal physician) to Tsar Alexander I of Russia and to Maria Feodorovna, the Dowager Empress. He was also head of medical services in that country, receiving several Russian and Prussian honours.  Geological studies  Retiring to England, Crichton wrote several books dealing with medical and geological subjects, becoming a member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1819. Crichton's extensive collection of minerals consisted mainly of specimens from Siberia, Russia, Norway, Hungary, Germany, the UK, the US and India. These were acquired during his tenure as physician to Alexander I of Russia and during his travels throughout Europe when he was studying medicine.  ADHD pioneer  He was the second person to describe a condition similar to the inattentive subtype of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in his book An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement: comprehending a concise system of the physiology and pathology of the human mind and a history of the passions and their effects (1798).  Slave ownership  Crichton was one of several people across the country who benefited from the compensation scheme to slave owners after slave ownership was outlawed by the British government in 1833 under the Slavery Abolition Act. Crichton received £4184 0S 1D for 240 enslaved.  Death  Crichton died at The Groves, near Sevenoaks, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery, where his monument is a gabled granite slab.

Facts The owner of two horses had come on board a ferry from Birkenhead to Liverpool. The ferryman refused to carry the horses. The owner refused to take them back on shore, and so the ferryman took the bridle from the owner turned the horses loose at the landing. The owner stayed put on board, and did not try to get the horses back. He sued the ferryman for conversion. The judge at the trial told the jury that the defendant ferryman, by taking the horses from the plaintiff and turning them out of the vessel, had been guilty of a conversion. The ferryman appealed. Judgment Lord Abinger CJ gave the leading judgment. The Exchequer Court held that the ferryman was not guilty of conversion, because there was no interference with the plaintiff's \\"general right of dominion\\" over the horses. “In my opinion,” said Lord Abinger CJ, > “he should have added to his direction, that it was for them to consider > what was the intention of the defendant in so doing. It is a proposition > familiar to all lawyers, that a simple asportation of a chattel, without any > intention of making any further use of it, although it may be a sufficient > foundation for an action of trespass, is not sufficient to establish a > conversion. It has never yet been held that the single act of removal of a > chattel, independent of any claim over it, either in favour of the party > himself or any one else, amounts to a conversion of the chattel.” Rolfe B gave a now well recognised definition of conversion that it is, > \\"a taking with the intent of exercising over the chattel an ownership > inconsistent with the real owner's right of possession\\".

From 1940 to 1943 he attended Kingston School of Art, and then, as a conscientious objector worked on the land. This caused a rift with his father, an Admiralty engineer, and was thought by his intimates to account, at least in part, for the palpable emotional depth and passion of his paintings. In 1946, he began training at the Borough Polytechnic in Southwark (now London South Bank University), under David Bomberg, and in the same year he became a founder member of the influential Borough Group of artists. Fellow members included the Group's founding president, Cliff Holden, Dorothy Mead and Dennis Creffield. In 1952, he and his first wife, Eleanor (later Susanna) Richmond moved to Aix-en-Provence, France, and in 1954 to Ronda, Andalusia, Spain, where he lived and worked for over twenty years. At various times he taught art at Portsmouth Polytechnic and Morley College in London, where his students included Tatiana Litvinov, daughter of Joseph Stalin's one-time Foreign Minister. Other students included Nigel Caple (whom Richmond met at Portsmouth Polytechnic, and where Richmond came into severe conflict with marxists who were then dominant in the art department) and Rosie Skaife d'Ingerthorpe, who had graduated from Goldsmiths College. He moved back to Britain in 1979, later taking up residence in North Yorkshire, where he painted, exhibited and taught. Students came to train with him on study leave, especially from St Albans College of Art, later part of Hertfordshire University. In 1994, he moved to Middlesbrough with his second wife Miranda, where he painted until his death. His final exhibition of paintings opened on 7 November 2008 at the Boundary Gallery in north London; it included a room of his early works and a room of his last paintings. Richmond had a strong spiritual sense, regarding painting as similar to prayer, and nurtured a lifelong determination never to become what he called a \\"dealer's artist\\". A month before his death he published a letter in The Guardian very critical of a materialistic ethos in contemporary western art, provoked by the auction at Sotheby's of work by Damien Hirst.Letters, The Guardian, 16 September 2008 References External links *Laurie Stewart, Notes on the Borough Group of Artists *Cliff Holden, The History of the Borough Group of Artists, 2004 *Michael McNay, Miles Richmond: Artist for whom imagination linked the philosopher's view with the painter's (Obituary), The Guardian, 15 October 2008 *Angus Reid, Miles Richmond, Obituary, The Scotsman, 15 October 2008 *Paul Trewhela, Miles Richmond: Painter who followed his teacher David Bomberg on an uncompromising artistic path, The Independent, 1 November 2008 *Miles Richmond's website Category:1922 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Isleworth Category:Alumni of London South Bank University Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:21st-century English painters Category:Academics of the University of Portsmouth Category:British conscientious objectors Category:Borough Group Category:English contemporary artists ","title":"Miles Richmond"},{"id":"20024121","text":"Ishk may refer to: * Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge, the educational charity founded by the psychologist Robert E.

The county was founded by the Normans after their conquest of Apulia in the 1050s. Several Norman monarchs held their court at Lecce, and Tancred of Hauteville, who was Count of Lecce from 1149 to 1194, was born here. His daughter Elvira Maria Albina married Walter III of Brienne, whose family held the duchy of Lecce in the following centuries. In 1384 Mary of Enghien, a granddaughter of Isabella of Brienne, became Countess of Lecce. When she married Raimondo Orsini del Balzo, Count of Soleto and (from 1393 to 1406) Prince of Taranto, all of the Salento was united into one of the largest fiefdoms in the Kingdom of Naples and Italy. Raimondo improved the administration of the county and the city. After his death, the county went to his son, Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, who had also inherited the Principality of Taranto in 1420.

Receiving's emergency department treats more than 105,000 patients annually, and nearly 60% of Michigan's emergency physicians are trained at Receiving. Receiving also features the state's largest burn center, Michigan's first hospital-based 24/7 hyperbaric oxygen therapy program, and Metro Detroit's first certified primary stroke center. In addition, the hospital has a comprehensive neurosurgical unit. It is one of the eight hospitals and institutions that comprise the Detroit Medical Center. History Detroit Receiving Hospital (DRH) was founded in 1915 as a city- owned hospital, dedicated to caring for everyone, regardless of ability to pay. In 1965, the hospital was renamed Detroit General, and maintained that mission. In 1980, Detroit General moved to a new 320-bed facility, and reclaimed the name Detroit Receiving Hospital. DRH was the first American College of Surgeons verified Level I Trauma Center in Michigan, and one of the first in the nation. Focusing on adult medical care for emergency, trauma, and critically ill patients, the majority of DRH patients arrive through the emergency department. The University Health Center clinics adjacent to Detroit Receiving treat more than 250,000 patients annually, making it one of the busiest ambulatory facilities in the country. Approximately 95% of the physicians on staff at the hospital also serve on the faculty of Wayne State University School of Medicine. In 1976, before emergency medicine was recognized as a specialty, Detroit Receiving began a postgraduate emergency medicine training program. Nearly half the physicians currently practicing in Michigan have received some of their training at Detroit Receiving Hospital. On May 2, 2018, Tenet decided to terminate its century long contract with Wayne State University School of Medicine. Tenet CEO cited a letter sent April 27, 2018 in which Wayne State threatened to sever ties if a deal was not reached on May 15, 2018. Anonymous members of Wayne State University Physician Group said that Tenet had already had plans to sever ties prior. Many conflicts arose during the tumultuous relationship including Tenet's unwillingness to contribute to medical student education and reinvest profits to medical research which is typical of true academic research centers. Clinical specialties Specialties at Detroit Receiving include emergency medicine, orthopaedic traumatology, neurosurgery, cardiology, trauma surgery, and burn treatment, earning national and international recognition for the hospital. DRH was also the site of the first cranioplasty, using a pre-cast replica of missing bone to repair a skull. Detroit Receiving, along with Harper University Hospital, is home to Cardio Team One, a cardiac care program designed to improve the response time for patients presenting at an emergency department with severe cardiac disease. Training programs Detroit Receiving is the site of Wayne State University School of Medicine affiliated residency and fellowship training programs, including anesthesiology, emergency medicine, general surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, neurology, orthopedic surgery, pathology, podiatry, psychiatry, radiology, and urology. Established in 1976 by Brooks Bock and Judith Tintinalli, Detroit Receiving Hospital Emergency Medicine Residency Program is one of nation's first training program in emergency medicine and the first program of its type to be established in the state of Michigan. Detroit Trauma Symposium Detroit Receiving hosts the longest-running, annual trauma conference in the country, the Detroit Trauma Symposium. Art collection The facility received an award from the American Institute of Architecture for design, and houses an art collection, composed of donations to DRH over a 30-year period. The collection features more than 1,200 pieces, estimated at more than $3 million, one of the largest hospital-based collections in the nation. Accreditation Detroit Receiving Hospital is listed in The Leapfrog Group’s 2008 Top Hospital list for patient quality and safety. The Leapfrog group identified 33 hospitals, (26 adult and 7 pediatric) which have achieved the highest level for quality and safety practices.

Never sent off, booked or even spoken to by a referee, he gained a reputation for sportmanship and gentlemanly conduct. An unflappable, cultured right back, who preferred, sometimes to the disquiet of managers and supporters alike, to play the ball out of defence even in the tightest of situations, he never lost the attacking instincts of the forward he had been in his younger days, and operated very much in the style of a modern wing- back. Bamford was an integral part of the Rovers' side which won promotion from Division Three (South) to Division Two in 1953 under manager Bert Tann. Bamford joined Rovers in December 1945, having been spotted while playing for St. Silas School Old Boys. Before his call-up in 1939 to the First Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment where he played at a high level for Army football and rugby teams in Burma and India, he had played for local Bristol teams as a forward, including his school St. Silas, winning three caps for and captaining Bristol Boys, and also playing briefly for Bristol City Colts. He had also signed amateur forms with Ipswich Town. Because of the war, his professional career began at the relatively late age of 25, but in spite of this he played in the second highest number of Bristol Rovers games of any players at the club, behind only Stuart Taylor. In the summer of 1951, Bamford was part of an England 'B' XI that toured Australia drawing huge crowds. While still a player, Bamford had become a qualified FA coach.He was riding his motorcycle to a coaching session with the boys of Clark's Grammar School in Clifton on 28 October 1958 when he was involved in a collision with a delivery van in Apsley Road. He remained in Frenchay hospital for three days before dying from his injuries on 31 October. Bamford had been a regular for Rovers until an injury in the 3 September 1958 game against Derby County meant he was replaced by Brian Doyle and, even when fit again, was playing in the Reserves. His funeral was held at the church of St. Mary Redcliffe on Thursday 6 November 1958 and was attended by over a thousand people. Many more lined the route taken by the cortege to Arnos Vale Cemetery. A fund set up for his widow Violet and two daughters (one born posthumously), The Harry Bamford Memorial Fund, raised over £6,000, swelled by the proceeds of a memorial game between a Combined Bristol XI and Arsenal on 8 May 1959. Legacy After his death the Harry Bamford memorial trophy was created in his honour. This was to be awarded every year to the Bristol footballer, amateur or professional, who best emulated Bamford's sportsmanship and dedication. The awards ceased in 1973.The trophy was lost in 1980 when Rovers' Eastville Stadium sustained serious fire damage. However, it resurfaced in 2014, having been found in a dusty box. In 2014, the trophy was revived and presentations were made at the Memorial Ground and Ashton Gate to 40 ex-Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and amateur players nominated by the public, for each of the 40 seasons for which it had been in abeyance. A second junior trophy, also anonymously donated in 1967, was similarly revived. In 2019 it was decided to discontinue the junior trophy which had only been awarded originally on three occasions and that a new trophy should be made to replace it in memory of Michael (Mickey) Barrett, another Bristol Rovers player who died of cancer at the age of 24 in 1984. It will be awarded annually to a Bristol Rovers youth player who conducts himself in a professional and sportsmanlike manner on and off the pitch to inspire younger players to uphold the best traditions of the game.

Marketed primarily to competition shooters as a replacement for .38 Super for International Practical Shooting Confederation, United States Practical Shooting Association and International Defensive Pistol Association competition, the cartridge failed to find significant market success despite a high-profile introduction. The critical design feature of the 9×23mm Winchester is a much-strengthened case that does away with the semi-rimmed case design of the .38 Super which sometimes caused feeding problems. The strengthened case allows the 9×23mm Winchester to operate under a higher internal pressure, 55,000 psi (measured with a piezoelectric transducer), in comparison to the maximum pressure of 36,500 psi for the .38 Super (current SAAMI standards). It has a slightly tapered but nearly parallel case which means that it has greater magazine capacity for the same 9 mm bore diameter relative to the necked down cases of the .357 SIG, 9×25mm Super Auto G, or 9×25mm Dillon. To achieve enough propellant capacity for the power needed the 9×23mm Winchester is longer than the 9×19mm Parabellum or .357 SIG and so requires the extra magazine front to back length of an M1911 style magazine. History Patent 5,187,324 was filed by John Ricco of CP Bullets in 1992 for an \\"improved 9mm cartridge casing\\" that he called the 9×23mm Super. He had the prototype brass casings made by Winchester Ammunition. They then modified the design slightly and filed it under patent 5,507,232 in 1995. In comparison to the popular 9×19mm Parabellum, Winchester had lengthened the overall case by 4 mm and made it much stronger. They named it the 9×23mm Winchester. In comparison to the long established .38 Super Auto, also a 9×23mm, the new cartridge was rimless rather than semi-rimmed. Drawing of 9×23 Winchester cartridge. Announced to the public in early 1996 at an NRA convention, the 9×23mm Winchester cartridge was claimed to have the lowest recoiling load and still qualify for Major Power Factor designation in the IPSC. The IPSC Power Factor (PF) is equal to bullet weight in grains times muzzle velocity divided by 1,000. A PF of at least 175 was needed to qualify as Major within the Power Factor designation used within IPSC competitions. A Minor power factor carried scoring penalties and so there was an incentive to make the Major qualification. As the power factor calculation is proportional to bullet momentum and as the very large proportion of recoil is proportional to bullet momentum, it is immediately clear that the 9×23mm Winchester had essentially the same power factor and recoil as .45 ACP. The true benefit of the 9×23mm Winchester came from two things. Firstly, more rounds could be fitted into the magazine and that, in general, allowed fewer magazine changes to be made in the course of a contest task spread over multiple targets. Secondly, the higher operating pressure of the 9×23mm Winchester meant that a compensated pistol, where holes or slots in the barrel project high pressure gas upwards before the bullet leaves the barrel, had a greater ability to reduce the upward flip of the muzzle under recoil. That meant that users of the 9×23mm Winchester were able to return to target in less time than with a compensated .45 ACP pistol of otherwise identical design. Since speed was a major element in the scoring system within IPSC competitions there was an obvious advantage to the 9×23mm Winchester over the .45 ACP. This double competition benefit of the 9×23mm Winchester was the motivation behind Ricco's design and Winchester's production of its almost identical twin. Because Ricco had used Winchester to produce his prototype cases and they had then used the design themselves, Ricco was able to sue Winchester and after some 7 years he won his case.Pistolsmith Profile - Dane Burns The 7-year delay to production caused by the court case effectively killed the cartridge because the IPSC had changed the power factor boundary from 175 to 165 before Winchester started production. The reason for this was that many pistols based on the 9×19mm Parabellum, 9×21mm, and .38 Super Auto were being used beyond their safe pressure limits for the same reasons that made the 9×23mm Winchester desirable. Many were blowing up, causing the IPSC to reduce the power factor boundary to one that could be reached with those cartridges in safety. When the 9×23mm Winchester came to market with its much increased pressure ceiling, produced by thickening the web section of the cartridge case, it was no longer needed. As it is perceived as a purely competition cartridge it has made almost no penetration into the self-defense world. Effects Factory 9×23 Winchester ammunition. SP = Soft Point. STHP = Silver Tip Hollow Point. gr = weight in grains. The performance of the 9×23mm Winchester is similar to and sometimes exceeds the .357 SIG because it runs at higher pressures. (These figures can match or exceed the factory ballistics of a .357 SIG in a 4-inch test barrel at 1350~1475 fps.) As it is very close to the overall length of the .45 ACP and 10mm Auto cartridges, it needs a large frame automatic such as the M1911. As the smaller frame, medium bore, pistols chambered for 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&W; and .357 SIG are more convenient for personal carry, the 9×23mm Winchester has not gained the mainstream recognition of the .357 SIG though it has similar ballistics as well as higher magazine capacity. Reloading Left to right: 9×23mm Largo, the 9×19mm Parabellum, 9×23mm Winchester, and 9×23mm Steyr. Although dimensionally nearly identical, the cartridge case walls of the 9×23mm Largo are not thick enough to handle the higher pressure of the 9×23mm Winchester. The maximum over all length of the cartridge can vary with the magazine length of the converted pistol. A Star Super B converted to 9×23mm may be loaded to 1.29 inches while a converted Tokarev may be loaded to 1.36 inches. Using this cartridge at full power in a handgun built around the standard .38 Super +P pressure limits and lower may result in a drastically increased level of wear on the firearm or even serious damage to it due to insufficient tensile strength and hardening of the frame, slide and various small parts. This is not a significant design problem as the recoil forces are directly comparable to those of the .45 ACP, and the lock up between barrel and slide is normally more than adequate to handle the increased pressure. The barrel must certainly be strong enough for the increased pressure but modern metallurgy makes that simple enough. Pistols produced by Colt for a short period were not strengthened in any obvious way relative to their .45 ACP equivalent. The same was true of the first 10mm 1911 pistols produced by Colt and they had to be strengthened, but with full pressure loads recoil was higher than with the .45 ACP. The Tokarev is an inherently strong design and can handle sustained use of all but the highest pressure loadings. Older .38 Super pistols, are a less optimal basis for a 9×23mm Winchester pistol. Pistols made for various earlier 9×23mm cartridges, such as the 9×23mm Steyr, the Bergman–Bayard or 9×23mm Largo should never be used with the 9×23mm Winchester cartridge. Equally, the cases for those obsolete cartridges should never be used to make 9×23mm Winchester cartridges though it is unlikely that anyone would wish to do so as their collector value is higher than the cost of new 9×23mm Winchester cases, when they can be obtained, made by Winchester or Starline (Starline's version of the 9×23mm Winchester is called the 9×23mm Comp9x23 Comp Brass (Small Rifle or Small Pistol primer) Starline Brass). It is worth noting that the internal capacity of Winchester and Starline manufactured cases are not quite the same and so maximum loads developed in one should not be applied to the other without working up again. Also, the Starline 9×23mm Comp has thinner walls than the original Winchester cases and will not withstand as much pressure in an unsupported chamber. Apart from that, the 9×23mm Winchester is a very long lasting cartridge case for reloading. The slight taper to the sides means that friction loads are greatly reduced after the first few millimeters of extraction after firing. The fact that it is not a bottlenecked case means that the brass is worked less as it is swaged back to size in the reloading process than cases like the .357 SIG where the shoulder is moved slightly with each fire and reload cycle. The less the brass is worked in this way the slower it hardens and the longer it will be before it tends to split. Small rifle-sized primers are generally used as they must withstand high pressure.

It was launched on April 18, 2018, atop a Falcon 9 rocket and was placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. The first light image from TESS was taken on August 7, 2018, and released publicly on September 17, 2018. Over the course of the two-year primary mission, TESS is expected to ultimately detect about 1250 transiting exoplanets orbiting the targeted stars, and an additional 13,000 transiting planets orbiting additional stars in the fields that TESS observed. As of 10 May 2020, TESS has identified 1835 candidate exoplanets, of which 46 have been confirmed so far. After the end of the primary mission around July 4, 2020, data from the prime mission will continue to be searched for planets, while the extended mission will continue to acquire additional data. The primary mission objective for TESS is to survey the brightest stars near the Earth for transiting exoplanets over a two-year period. The TESS satellite uses an array of wide-field cameras to perform a survey of 85% of the sky. With TESS, it is possible to study the mass, size, density and orbit of a large cohort of small planets, including a sample of rocky planets in the habitable zones of their host stars. TESS will provide prime targets for further characterization by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future. While previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets and the Kepler space telescope has mostly found planets around distant stars that are too faint for characterisation, TESS will find many small planets around the nearest stars in the sky. TESS records the nearest and brightest main sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets, which are the most favorable targets for detailed investigations. TESS uses a novel highly elliptical orbit around the Earth with an apogee approximately at the distance of the Moon and a perigee of 108,000 km. TESS orbits Earth twice during the time the Moon orbits once, a 2:1 resonance with the Moon. The orbit is expected to remain stable for a minimum of ten years. Led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with seed funding from Google, on April 5, 2013, it was announced that TESS, along with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), had been selected by NASA for launch.  History  The concept of TESS was first discussed in 2005 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). The genesis of TESS was begun during 2006, when a design was developed from private funding by individuals, Google, and The Kavli Foundation. In 2008, MIT proposed that TESS become a full NASA mission and submitted it for the Small Explorer program at Goddard Space Flight Center, but it was not selected. It was resubmitted in 2010 as an Explorers program mission, and was approved in April 2013 as a Medium Explorer mission. TESS passed its critical design review (CDR) in 2015, allowing production of the satellite to begin. While Kepler had cost US$640 million at launch, TESS cost only US$200 million (plus US$87 million for launch). The mission will find exoplanets that periodically block part of the light from their host stars, events called transits. TESS will survey 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun to search for transiting exoplanets. TESS launched on April 18, 2018, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  Mission overview  TESS is designed to carry out the first spaceborne all-sky transiting exoplanet survey. It is equipped with four wide-angle telescopes and associated charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. Science data are transmitted to Earth every two weeks. Full- frame images with an effective exposure time of two hours will be transmitted as well, enabling scientists to search for unexpected, transient phenomena, such as the optical counterparts to gamma-ray bursts. TESS also hosts a Guest Investigator program, allowing scientists from other organizations to use TESS for their own research. The resources allocated to Guest programs allow an additional 20,000 celestial bodies to be observed. TESS - Southern Sky panorama = Orbital dynamics = In order to obtain unobstructed imagery of both the northern and southern hemispheres of the sky, TESS utilizes a 2:1 lunar resonant orbit called P/2, an orbit that has never been used before (although IBEX uses a similar P/3 orbit). The highly elliptical orbit has a apogee, timed to be positioned approximately 90° away from the position of the Moon to minimize its destabilizing effect. This orbit should remain stable for decades and will keep TESS's cameras in a stable temperature range. The orbit is entirely outside the Van Allen belts to avoid radiation damage to TESS, and most of the orbit is spent far outside the belts. Every 13.7 days at its perigee of , TESS will downlink to Earth over a period of approximately 3 hours the data it has collected during the just finished orbit. = Science objectives = TESS – first light (August 7, 2018) The 26 observation sectors of the sky planned for TESS TESS's two-year all-sky survey will focus on nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than magnitude 12. Approximately 200,000 stars will be studied, including the 1,000 closest red dwarfs across the whole sky, an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission. TESS is expected to discover more than 20,000 transiting exoplanets, including 500 to 1000 Earth-sized planets and super-Earths. Of those discoveries, an estimated 20 could be super-Earths located in the habitable zone around a star. The stated goal of the mission is to determine the masses of at least 50 Earth- sized planets (at most 4 times earth radii).https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/primary-science.html Most detected exoplanets are expected to be between 30 and 300 light-years away. The survey is broken up into 26 observation sectors, each sector being , with an overlap of sectors at the ecliptic poles to allow additional sensitivity toward smaller and longer-period exoplanets in that region of the celestial sphere. The spacecraft will spend two 13.7-day orbits observing each sector, mapping the southern hemisphere of sky in its first year of operation and the northern hemisphere in its second year. The cameras actually take images every 2 seconds, but all the raw images would represent much more data volume than can be stored or downlinked. To deal with this, cutouts around 15,000 selected stars (per orbit) will be coadded over a 2-minute period and saved on board for downlink, while full-frame images will also be coadded over a 30-minute period and saved for downlink. The actual data downlinks will occur every 13.7 days near perigee. This means that during the 2 years, TESS will continuously survey 85% of the sky for 27 days, with certain parts being surveyed across multiple runs. The survey methodology was designed such that the area that will be surveyed, essentially continuously, over an entire year (351 observation days) and makes up about 5% of the entire sky, will encompass the regions of sky (near the ecliptic poles) which will be observable at any time of year with the JWST. In October 2019, Breakthrough Listen started a collaboration with scientists from the TESS team to look for signs of advanced extraterrestrial life. Thousands of new planets found by TESS will be scanned for \\"technosignatures\\" by Breakthrough Listen partner facilities across the globe. Data from TESS monitoring of stars will also be searched for anomalies. = Asteroseismology = The TESS team also plans to use a 30-minute observation cadence for full-frame images, which has been noted for imposing a hard Nyquist limit that can be problematic for asteroseismology of stars. Asteroseismology is the science that studies the internal structure of stars by the interpretation of their frequency spectra. Different oscillation modes penetrate to different depths inside the star. The Kepler and PLATO observatories are also intended for asteroseismology.  Launch  The Falcon 9 rocket carrying TESS, launching from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral in April 2018. In December 2014, SpaceX was awarded the contract to launch TESS in August 2017, for a total contract value of . The 362 kg spacecraft was originally scheduled to launch on March 20, 2018, but this was pushed back by SpaceX to allow additional time to prepare the launch vehicle and meet NASA launch service requirements. A static fire of the Falcon 9 rocket was completed on April 11, 2018, at approximately 18:30 UTC. The launch was postponed again from April 16, 2018, and TESS was eventually launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the SLC-40 launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on April 18. The Falcon 9 launch sequence included a 149-second burn by the first stage, followed by a 6-minute second stage burn. Meanwhile, the first-stage booster performed controlled-reentry maneuvers and successfully landed on the autonomous drone ship Of Course I Still Love You. After coasting for 35 minutes, the second stage performed a final 54-second burn that placed TESS into a supersynchronous transfer orbit of 200 by 270,000 km at an inclination of 28.5 degrees. The second stage released the payload, after which the stage itself was placed in a heliocentric orbit. An experimental water landing was performed for the fairing, as part of SpaceX's attempt to develop fairing reusability.  Spacecraft  TESS spacecraft before launch In 2013, Orbital Sciences received a four-year, contract to build TESS for NASA. TESS uses an Orbital Sciences LEOStar-2 satellite bus, capable of three-axis stabilization using four hydrazine thrusters plus four reaction wheels providing better than three arc-second fine spacecraft pointing control. Power is provided by two single-axis solar arrays generating 400 watts. A Ka-band dish antenna provides a 100 Mbit/s science downlink. = Operational orbit = Animation of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite trajectory from April 18, 2018 to December 18, 2019 Planned orbital maneuvers after release from Falcon 9's 2nd stage. Horizontal axis schematically represents longitude relative to the moon, vertical axis is altitude. A1M = Apogee 1 manoeuvre, P1M = Perigee 1 manoeuvre, etc., TCM = trajectory correction manoeuvre (optional), PAM = period adjustment manoeuvre. Once injected into the initial orbit by the Falcon 9 second stage, the spacecraft performed four additional independent burns that placed it into a lunar flyby orbit. On May 17, the spacecraft underwent a gravity assist by the Moon at above the surface, and performed the final period adjustment burn on May 30.https://twitter.com/NASA_TESS/status/1002603655722397696 It achieved an orbital period of 13.65 days in the desired 2:1 resonance with the Moon, at 90 degrees phase offset to the Moon at apogee, which is expected to be a stable orbit for at least 20 years, thus requiring very little fuel to maintain. The entire maneuvering phase was expected to take a total of two months, and bring the craft in an eccentric orbit () at a 37° inclination. The total delta-v budget for orbit maneuvers was , which is 80% of the mission's total available reserves. If TESS receives an on-target or slightly above nominal orbit insertion by the Falcon 9, a theoretical mission duration in excess of 15 years would be possible from a consumables standpoint. = Project timeline = The first light image was made on August 7, 2018, and released publicly on September 17, 2018. TESS completed its commissioning phase at the end of July and the science phase officially started on July 25. For the first two years of operation TESS monitored both the southern (year 1) and northern (year 2) celestial hemispheres. During its nominal mission TESS tiles the sky in 26 separate segments, with a 27.4-day observing period per segment. = Scientific instrumentation = The sole instrument on TESS is a package of four wide-field-of-view CCD cameras. Each camera features four low-noise, low- power 4 megapixel CCDs created by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The four CCDs are arranged in a 2x2 detector array for a total of 16 megapixels per camera and 16 CCDs for the entire instrument. Each camera has a field of view, a effective pupil diameter, a lens assembly with seven optical elements, and a bandpass range of . The TESS lenses have a combined field of view of (2,300 deg2, around 5% of the entire sky) and a focal ratio of . The ensquared energy, the fraction of the total energy of the point-spread function that is within a square of the given dimensions centered on the peak, is 50% within and 90% within . For comparison, Kepler's primary mission only covered an area of the sky measuring 105 deg2, though the K2 extension has covered many such areas for shorter times.  Ground operations  The TESS ground system is divided between eight sites around the United States. These include NASA's Space Network and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Deep Space Network for command and telemetry, Orbital ATK Mission Operations Center, MIT Payload Operations Center, the Ames Research Center Science Processing Operations Center, The Goddard Space Flight Center Flight Dynamics Facility, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory TESS Science Office, and the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).  Stable light source for tests  One of the issues facing the development of this type of instrument is having an ultra-stable light source to test on. In 2015, a group at the University of Geneva made a breakthrough in the development of a stable light source. While this instrument was created to support ESA's CHEOPS exoplanet observatory, one was also ordered by the TESS program. Although both observatories plan to look at bright nearby stars using the transit method, CHEOPS is focused on collecting more data on known exoplanets, including those found by TESS and other survey missions.  Results  Test image taken before the start of science operations. The image is centered on the constellation Centaurus. In the top right corner the edge of the Coalsack Nebula can be seen, the bright star in the bottom left is Beta Centauri. TESS team partners include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Orbital ATK, NASA's Ames Research Center, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the Space Telescope Science Institute. TESS started science operations on July 25, 2018.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-s-planet-hunting-tess- catches-a-comet-before-starting-science The first announced finding from the mission was the observation of comet C/2018 N1. The first exoplanet detection announcement was on September 18, announcing the discovery of a super-Earth in the Pi Mensae system orbiting the star every 6 days, adding to a known super- Jupiter orbiting the same star every 5.9 years. On September 20, 2018, the discovery of an ultra-short period planet was announced, slightly larger than Earth, orbiting the red dwarf LHS 3844. With an orbital period of 11 hours, LHS 3844 b is one of the planets with the shortest known period. It orbits its star at a distance of . LHS 3844 b is also one of the closest known exoplanets to Earth, at a distance of 14.9 parsecs. TESS's third discovered exoplanet is HD 202772A b, a hot Jupiter orbiting the brighter component of the visual binary star HD 202772, located in the constellation Capricornus at a distance of about 480 light-years from Earth. The discovery was announced on October 5, 2018. HD 202772A b orbits its host star once every 3.3 days. It is an inflated hot Jupiter, and a rare example of hot Jupiters around evolved stars. It is also one of the most strongly irradiated planets known, with an equilibrium temperature of . On April 15, 2019, TESS' first discovery of an earth-sized planet was reported. HD 21749 c is a rocky planet with about 89% of Earth's diameter and orbits the K-type main sequence star HD 21749 in about 8 days. The planet's surface temperature is estimated to be as high as 427 °C. Both known planets in the system, HD 21749 b and HD 21749 c, were discovered by TESS. HD 21749 c represents the 10th confirmed planet discovery by TESS. Exoplanet LHS 3844 b (artist concept) Data on exoplanet candidates continue to be made available at MAST. As of April 20, 2019, the total number of candidates on the list was up to 335. Besides candidates identified as previously discovered exoplanets, this list also includes ten newly discovered exoplanets, including the five mentioned above. Forty-four of the candidates from Sector 1 in this list were selected for follow-up observations by the TESS Follow-Up Program (TFOP), which aims to aid the discovery of 50 planets with a planetary radius of R < 4R⊕ through repeated observations. The list of candidate exoplanets continues to grow as additional results are being published on the same MAST page. On July 18, 2019, after the first year of operation the southern portion of the survey was completed, now it turns its cameras to the Northern Sky. As of this time it has discovered 21 planets and has over 850 candidate exoplanets.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-tess-mission- completes-first-year-of-survey-turns-to-northern-sky NASA's TESS Mission Completes First Year of Survey, Turns to Northern Sky On July 23, 2019, the discovery of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab (HD 222259Ab) in the ~45 Myr old Tucana-Horologium young moving group was published in a paper. TESS did first observe the planet in November 2018 and it was confirmed in March 2019. The young planet is larger than Neptune, but smaller than Saturn. The system is bright enough to follow up with radial velocity and transmission spectroscopy. ESA's CHEOPS mission will observe the transits of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab. A team of scientists got 23.4 orbits approved in the first Announcement of Opportunity (AO-1) for the CHEOPS Guest Observers (GO) Programme to characterize the planet. On July 31, 2019, the discovery of exoplanets around the M-type dwarf star GJ 357 at a distance of 31 light years from Earth was announced. TESS directly observed the transit of GJ 357 b, a hot earth with an equilibrium temperature of around 250°C. Follow-up ground observations and analyses of historic data lead to the discovery of GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. While GJ 357 b and GJ 357 c are too close to the star to be habitable, GJ 357 d resides at the outer edge of the star's habitable zone and may possess habitable conditions if it has an atmosphere. With at least 6.1 M⊕ it is classified as a Super-Earth. As of September 2019, over 1000 TESS Objects of Interest (ToI) have been listed in the public database,https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_toi.php at least 29 of which are confirmed planets, about 20 of which within the stated goal of the mission of Earth-sized (<4 Earth radii).https://tess.mit.edu/publications/ On September 26, 2019, it was announced that TESS did observe its first tidal disruption event (TDE), called ASASSN-19bt. The TESS data revealed that ASASSN-19bt began to brighten on January 21, 2019, ~8.3 days before the discovery by ASAS-SN. On January 6, 2020, NASA reported the discovery of TOI 700 d, the first Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone discovered by the TESS. The exoplanet orbits the star TOI 700 100 light-years away in the Dorado constellation. The TOI 700 system contains two other planets: TOI 700b, another Earth-sized planet and TOI-700c, a super-Earth. This system is unique in that the larger planet is found between the two smaller planets. It is currently unknown how this arrangement of planets came to be, whether these planets formed in this order or if the larger planet migrated to its current orbit. On the same day NASA announced that astronomers used TESS data to show that Alpha Draconis is an eclipsing binary star. The same day, the discovery of TOI 1338 b was announced, the first circumbinary planet discovered with TESS. TOI 1338 b is around 6.9 times larger than Earth, or between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn. It lies in a system 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Pictor. The stars in the system make an eclipsing binary, which occurs when the stellar companions circle each other in our plane of view. One is about 10% more massive than our Sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only one-third the Sun's mass. TOI 1338b's transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. TESS only sees the transits crossing the larger star — the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Although the planet transits irregularly, its orbit is stable for at least the next 10 million years. The orbit's angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.  In popular culture  TESS is featured accurately in the 2018 film Clara.

Aside from space, literature also states that participants can be separated by time. Online tutoring is practiced using many different approaches for distinct sets of users. The distinctions are in content and user interface, as well as in tutoring styles and tutor-training methodologies. Definitions associated with online tutoring vary widely, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the technology, the refinement and variation in online learning methodology, and the interactions of the organizations that deliver online tutoring services with the institutions, individuals, and learners that employ the services. This Internet-based service is a form of micropublishing. Concept and definitions An institution can offer online tutoring through an internal or external tutoring website or through a learning management systems (LMS). Online environments applied in education could also involve the use of a virtual learning environment platform such as Moodle, Sakai, WebCT, Blackboard. Some of these are paid systems but some are free and open source such as Google+ Hangouts. Online tutoring may be offered either via a link in an LMS, or directly through the tutoring service's platform, where the subscriber may be required to pay for tutoring time before the delivery of service. Many educational institutions and major textbook publishers sponsor a certain amount of tutoring without a direct charge to the learner. Tutoring may take the form of a group of learners simultaneously logged in online, then receiving instruction from a single tutor, also known as many-to-one tutoring and live online tutoring. This is often known as e-moderation, defined as the facilitation of the achievement of goals of independent learning, learner autonomy, self-reflection, knowledge construction, collaborative or group- based learning, online discussion, transformative learning and communities of practice.Salmon, G. (2004). (2nd edition). E-moderating: The key to teaching and learning online. London: Routledge Falmer.Wenger, E. (1998). Communities of practice: Learning, meaning, and identity. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge.Mezirow, J. (2000). Learning as transformation: Critical perspectives on a theory in progress. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.Schon, D.A. (1987). Educating the reflective practitioner. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. These functions of moderation are based on constructivist or social- constructivist principles of learning. Another form of tutoring, called peer tutoring, connects peers, such as recent or fellow students within a course or subject, tutoring each other, and this may also be conducted as online tutoring over an online conferencing interface. Most commonly, however, individual learners or their parents either purchase tutoring time with a private vendor of online tutoring service. Such time may also be made available through the purchase of a book, access to a library, a textbook publisher, or enrollment in a particular school or school system. This is known as one-on-one tutoring. Asynchronous online tutoring is tutoring offered in a format in which the learner submits a question and the tutor responds at a later time. This is appropriate to detailed review of writing, for instance. It also enables cautious learners to retain control over how they submit questions and request assistance. The learner and the tutor need not be online at the same time. Synchronous online tutoring involves a shared interface, such that both the tutor and the learner (or a group of learners) are online at the same time. This requires implementation of browser-based software and may or may not require the learner to download proprietary software. Some online tutoring services use telephonic or VOIP communication, and/or video communication. WebRTC technology is making it easier to tutor online by delivering live video and audio streaming through the browser. This eliminates the common friction points for user in terms of signing up, inviting students, and downloading external plugins. There are a number of private firms that provide online tutoring. A third-party online tutoring service offering asynchronous one-on-one tutoring was available as early as 1996. From the very beginning of online tutoring, controversy surrounded several concerns voiced by educators and parents. Researchers recognised that online tutoring required three components: # online tutors adopt a specific pedagogy (educational method), encompassing both instructional and social support or group development; # online tutoring management coordinates and organizes the implementation of the service; and # unlike traditional face-to-face tutoring, online tutoring requires a usable user interface and technical support to maintain both the hardware and the software sides of the operation. The questions raised by online tutoring include: # How does a parent or teacher know that the online tutor is qualified to give help, as opposed to simply giving answers to the learner? # Assuming the online tutor is qualified as an instructor, how does online tutoring relate to course instruction? # How reliable is the interface? Will it accommodate the discussion of the tutored material at a comparable level to a traditional classroom setting? Within higher education, tutoring is considered to be adult-to-adult guidance within a specific course or subject for the clear purpose of advancing learning competence in an area of study. Generally, a tutor is an academic, a lecturer or professor who has responsibility for teaching in a degree/diploma program in a university or vocational teaching and learning setting. Learning centers at post-secondary school campuses may incorporate either e-moderating or one- to-one online tutoring, or both, creating a distance learning program, whether or not the campus or student courses are conducted online. In distance learning, tutors may be recruited specifically for the role of teaching and supporting students through online tutoring. Inheriting the role of the tutor, the online tutor must have excellent online communication skills and the ability to discern learning objectives, and must guide students successfully towards the attainment of those objectives. This form of tutoring may vary from primary instruction to assistance with assigned coursework.Hock, M.F., Deshler, D.D., and Shumaker, J.B. (1999), \\"Tutoring programs for academically underprepared college students: a review of the literature\\", [Electronic version]. Journal of College Reading and Learning. 29(2), 101-122. State of the art Online tutoring presupposes a self-motivated and independent learner. The learning aspect of tutoring outweighs the teaching aspect. E-moderating usually refers to group online or web-based learning that * is based on constructivist and social-constructivist principles; * focuses on using online dialogue and peer learning to enrich learning within the online environment; * focuses on achieving goals of independent learning, learner autonomy, self-reflection, knowledge construction, collaborative or group- based learning, online discussion, transformative learning and communities of learning, as opposed to delivering online content via a transmission medium; and * is also a way of adding extra value and service to traditional educational services (postal services can be expensive and slow, yielding to the cost-effectiveness and speed of online resources). The main advantage of private one-to-one tutoring was described by Benjamin Bloom (educator and psychologist) in 1984 in Two sigmas problem.http://web.mit.edu/bosworth/MacData/afs.course/5/5.95/readings/bloom- two-sigma.pdf The effect described by Bloom appears to carry over into online tutoring, although there is limited research to support this conclusion. In a rare study comparing the performance of students with access to online tutoring with that of students who did not have access to online tutoring remarked on the apparent tendency of the availability of online tutoring appeared to encourage students to stay in a course.Kersaint, Gladis; Dogbey, James, Barber, Jeff, and Kephart, David (2011). The effect of Access to an Online Tutorial Service on College Algebra Student Outcomes. Mentoring and Tutoring: Partnership in Learning, v.19 n1 p25-44. Research is being completed using capability matrices to evaluate students. Once evaluated, the students are clustered into groups with like capabilities. Once grouped, the students can participate in online tutoring with students with similar capabilities allowing a group setting and participation. The capability matrices are then run again to track the changes in capability and track learning.Ayers, E., Nugent, R., and Dean, N. (2008) Skill set profile clustering based on student capability vectors computed from online tutoring data. In: EDM2008: 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, 20–21 June 2008, Montreal, Canada Practice = Differences between online and face-to-face tutoring = In both online and face-to-face tutoring, similarities lie in the areas of group dynamics, need for roles within the group and design to encourage in-group interaction. Differences include the need for more facilitation to help structure discussions, with group roles emerging more slowly in the online setting. There is a spectrum of intervention in online discussions from occasional guidance (assignment assistance) to full-scale design and support of learning groups and tasks (instruction). The first of these is known as tactical online tutoring and the second as strategic online tutoring. =Tactical online tutoring= Tactical tutors are expected to display sensitivity to group interactions and progress, or the lack thereof, and to respond within an online interaction at critical moments in which their mastery of the subject and ability to explain it is requested by the learner or in which the learner makes manifest errors. They are more likely than strategic tutors to be employed in one-on-one interfaces. Asynchronous tutoring allows a tutor to convey insight into strengths and weaknesses of a learner's work. Synchronous or live tutoring can provide help at the moment the learner becomes conscious of a problem and logs in. Private online tutoring services In general, academic online tutors are available through various virtual learning environments to help learners answer questions on specific subject matter, to help in the writing of essays, and to assist with research. Offerings vary from sites loosely associated with campuses, to sites directly contracted by and operating in concert with educational institutions, textbook publishers, or libraries. Access to the publisher or campus-provided online tutoring may be limited to just a few hours. Other major concerns of parents or teachers in making use of online tutoring services include: # the perceived indifference of an online tutor to a learner's developmental issues that reach beyond a single session; # cultural communication difficulties that might arise between remote tutors and a local learner; and # doubts as to the academic qualifications of the online tutor, even if certified by a corporation. =Strategic online tutoring= Strategic tutors do more prior planning, including determining the number of learners per groupJacques, D., and Salmon, G (2007) Learning in Groups: A Handbook for on and off line environments, Routledge, London and New York. and membership. Smaller groups are more likely to cultivate trust, whereas a larger group provides for greater heterogeneity and promotes interaction and task achievement. Six is reported to be the smallest size for good online work, and fifteen is the maximum for full participation. For strategic online tutoring, full participation depends upon robust connectivity and efficient use of bandwidth to guarantee full participation. Design for group learning The prior design of online activities, sometimes known as e-tivities, is one aspect of strategic tutoring. E-tivities promote peer group learning and result in less online tutoring time. E-tivities have the following characteristics: * they can optimise student engagement if they are authentic and relevant learning activities; * they can take any form of structured participative group work online; and * they are based on one key topic or question to make online e-moderating easy and to provide motivation, engagement and purpose. Worksheets, online bulletin boards, and threaded discussions are examples of tools for e-tivities. An e-tivity may be an effective learning tool if it has an illustrative title, a stimulus or challenge, involves invitations to learners to post messages, is carefully timed, has postings to which others can add, and summaries, critiques or feedback from the e-moderator. Online tutors can take a similar approach using podcasts.Salmon, G. and Edirisingha, P. (2008) Podcasting for Learning in Universities, OUP/SHRE Buckingham. =Scaffolding= Two necessary assumptions about online tutors is that they possess academic qualification sufficient to educate and that they have specific training to meet the challenges of online communication. Online tutors also need to be aware of the stages learners usually employ in the online environment; these stages determine the kinds of scaffolding (help) that is appropriate for learners at each stage. Salmon (2004) suggests five stages for learning and scaffolding appropriate to each: # Access and motivation # Online socialization # Information exchange # Knowledge construction # Development Critical success factors =Training and development= Staff who are inexperienced online will inevitably try to transfer into online tutoring what has worked for them in the past or what they believe is the only valid method for their discipline. Further, the values embedded in many commonly used VLEs contribute to counterproductive behaviors for online tutoring. The key competencies needed by tutors are the abilities to: * support group learning within the technology without the need for face-to-face meetings or pictures; * provide scaffolding (see above); * perceive and interpret online behaviors; * weave, which includes: ** Emphasizing a point to show wider application ** Collecting snippets up from different message and/or present in new way ** Highlighting contributions that link with others in ways the group has not noticed ** Agreeing or disagreeing with group contributions ** Correcting misunderstandings or insufficiency * summarize, which includes: ** Acknowledging the variety of ideas expressed in contributions ** Refocusing discussion, particularly where there are many contributions that stray from a central point ** Signaling closure ** Providing fresh starting points ** Reinforcing important contributions or ideas ** Providing an archive * give feedback; * classify participants' knowledge; * add knowledge and correct misconceptions in a timely manner where necessary; and * close discussions and move on. The key features for staff development are online and face-to-face in character: * Online training ** Gain facility with the medium of online communication and with the specific user interface to be used ** Model the online communication behavior expected of learner participants and students ** Focus efforts on tutoring and moderating processes and methods and away from details of the technology ** Use scaffolding (supporting ideas) that facilitates collaborative learning in preference to providing direct instruction * Face-to-face ** Focus on peer dialogue around models that are applicable in many settings ** Provide authentic situations for tutors to practice weaving, summarizing, and giving feedback ** Use fellow tutors as a resource when online development hits an obstacle = Dealing with characteristics of online environments= Online interaction is essentially verbal, so that nonverbal cues, often considered essential to the tutoring process, are not present. For example, in a text transferred back and forth online (asynchronous paper review), facial expressions, body movements and eye contact are not present. Both the tutor and the learner may need experience with the medium to get used to this. However, face-to-face meetings are not actually essential, since, with training, online tutors can exploit features of the online environment to communicate in new ways, such as by sketching on whiteboards or using a shared online calculator. The learner may be invited to reflect on the discussion or consult specific resources. The learner, too, may more consciously prepare a message in advance, and may choose to log in to \\"meet\\" with the tutor according to his or her own schedule.Garrison, D. R and Anderston, T. (2003) E-learning in the 21st Century: framework for research and practice, London: Routledge Falmer Both synchronous (live) and asynchronous online tutoring typically preserve an online record of tutor remarks or a tutoring session. The learner can use this record for future reference.  Self-led teams  As students become more experienced at working together online, some of the online facilitation roles can be delegated to the students. However, the students will need advice and training in order to become successful collaborators. Advice and training for self-led teams should include:Salmon, G. and Lawless, N. (2006) Management Education for the Twenty-first Century in The Handbook of Blended Learning, Bonk. C. J. and Graham, C. R. (eds) Pfeiffer, John Wiley & Sons Inc. * Establishing ground rules * Developing a shared sense of vision and purpose * Allocating roles, task and responsibilities * Communicating openly and frequently * Offering support * Meeting deadlines * Reviewing team performance and reflecting on contributions Current developments Online tutoring environments are moving beyond those offered by synchronous and asynchronous discussion technology, as often offered by VLEs. New opportunities for online tutoring are offered by Web 2.0 systems and multi-user virtual environments. =Web 2.0= Web 2.0 encompasses the use of the web in increasingly interactive ways, with social networking and user-generated content being two critical benefits. Social networks can be used to connect tutors and students, and can allow students to help each other on a peer-to-peer basis. User-generated content can be created by and used by both tutors and students. Online tutors may use Web 2.0 applications to render their online tutoring more flexible and current. For example, podcasts provide the advantage of the human voice, ease of use and mobile access to instruction (Salmon and Edisiringha 2008), and blogs may provide access to newly developed topics that can spur debate. Some online tutoring sites incorporated such tools into their interfaces even before Web 2.0 phenomena were widely discussed. =Multi-user virtual environments= Research is just beginning on the use of multi-user virtual environments (e.g. Second Life) and the role of avatars as Second Life tutors and learners. =Automated tutors= Online tutoring is one area for the application of various theories and implementations of tutoring provided to students by a computer. Companies involved in automated online tutoring include Wolfram Alpha, with its module called The Problem Generator (PG) Cognitive Tutor,Anderson, J. R., Corbett, A. T., Koedinger, K. R., & Pelletier, R. (1995). Cognitive tutor: Lesson learned. The journal of the learning sciences 4(2): 167–207. and others. All automated tutoring involves an application of some form of artificial intelligence to emulate human tutoring, generate appropriate responses, and guide students interaction from one level of learning to the next. The comparison of human and machine tutoring is an active area of study.Scandura, J. M. (2012). The role of automation in instruction: Recent advances in authorIT and TutorIT solve fundamental problems in developing intelligent tutoring systems. Technology, instruction, cognition and learning. 9: 3-8. For instance, it is unclear as of this time whether Cognitive Tutor is effective at improving student performance. =COVID-19= The COVID-19 crisis of 2020 and the ensuing lock downs in many countries have led to increased online tutoring by both established online tutoring agencies as well as traditional schools adapting to the new environment. This has led to challenges on the technological site, but also for teachers not used to teaching online and parents not used to working from home with their children around.

The cathedral is noted for its distinctive octagonal form. It is located at the northern end of Churchill Road in the city. Overview The new church was built on the ruins of an older church from the 15th century. It was named after St. George, after the Tabot (Ark) of the church was carried to the Battle of Adwa against the Italians during which the Ethiopians secured victory. The building was described in 1938 in an Italian tourist publication as a fine example of the European interpretation of Ethiopian church design.Guida dell'Africa Orientale Italiana, Milano,Consolazione Turistica Italiana, 1938, p.487 \\"La chiesa offre un interessante esempio di interpretazione europea della chiesa abissina tipica a pianta ottagonale. La decorazione è opera di artisti indigeni sotto la dirazione dei pittori Tedaldi e Pagliacci. Nel recinto, sono varie cappelle funerarie di grandi capi, nelle quali veglia pregando continuamente, il padre dell'anima, ossia il confessore del defunto\\" The Italian Fascist authorities set the building on fire in 1937. The cathedral was later restored by Emperor Haile Selassie following the liberation in 1941. Empress Zewditu was crowned at this Cathedral in 1917, and Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned there in 1930, and it became a pilgrimage site for Rastafarians. The Cathedral has a museum, and an Imperial throne is on display as is the stained glass works of artist Afewerk Tekle. Given the reason why the cathedral was named, it displays weaponry used in the wars against the Italians including curved swords and tridents and giant helmets made from the manes of lions.

Both islands are wildlife refuges, the larger of which is Howland Island. The pair of islands may also be referred to as Baker and Howland Islands. They are both part of the larger political territory of the United States Minor Outlying Islands and they are also both part of the larger geographic grouping of the Phoenix Islands. Each is a National Wildlife Refuge managed by a division of Interior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On January 6, 2009, President George Bush, in creating the monument, added both islands to the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The Howland-Baker exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is a 400 nautical- mile diameter area protected by the U.S. Coast Guard. The Howland-Baker EEZ has 425,700 km2; and by comparison, California has 423,970 km2. Howland Island was the area that Amelia Earhart was trying to reach in 1937 when she disappeared. In the age of Internet communication, the islands have attracted attention as the only land masses in the world associated with UTC−12:00, which is the last area on Earth for deadlines with a date to pass.  EEZ History  The 1976 Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act provided for the U.S. EEZs, which were further established by the Presidential Proclamation of 1983. The Treaty of Tarawa, signed in September 1979, came into force in September 1983, and created the international boundary of the EEZ between Baker Island and McKean Island. Article 4 specifically states, \\"The two Governments recognize the interest of their peoples in close cooperation for their mutual benefit in economic development relating to fisheries off their coasts.\\" Since 2008, the Kiribati side of this boundary has been a marine protected area, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area.  Land area and territorial claim  The islands combined are of uninhabited land. Howland and Baker are separated by .Distance calculator. How far is it from Howland Island Were Howland and Baker separate EEZs, the 200 nautical-mile EEZ radius for either of the two islands would overlap with 80% of the EEZ for the other island. As a combined area, this one EEZ is 4% of the total U.S. coastline (425,000 km2 out of 11,300,000 km2), larger than that of South Korea or Cuba. The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument extends out from each island. As per the 2009 presidential proclamation, the National Wildlife Refuge extends out from each island.  Geologic setting  Howland and Baker islands are volcanoes approximately 120-75 million years old, on top of which coral has formed platforms. In the EEZ there are ten moderate-sized seamounts from the Cretaceous Period. Most of the seabed is more than in depth, covered with abyssal sediment.  Economic potential  The only immediate mining potential is on and immediately offshore of the islands themselves (phosphates, sand, gravel, and coral) which would conflict with their protected status per the study. Iron deposits on a few seamounts are also mentioned as an intermediate possibility but no energy resources are identified. The islands have phosphorite and guano resources. However, all commercial extraction activities, including fishing and deep-sea mining, are prohibited in the wildlife refuges and submerged lands and waters of the Monument.https://georgewbush- whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2009/01/20090106-6.html  Boundary with Kiribati  The islands are considered to be a part of the Phoenix Islands, the rest of which are in Kiribati. The Winslow Reef borders the Howland-Baker EEZ, but is in Kiribati. The PacIOOS mentions that Winslow Reef is \\"on the southeast boundary line of the EEZ\\". The EEZ boundary lies halfway between Baker Island and McKean Island. Kiribati, as traced by the 1995 realignment of the International Date Line, arcs around Howland and Baker Islands as well as the US Possession Jarvis Island, from the west to the south and to the east. For example while the Winslow Reef in Kiribati is to the southeast of Howland and Baker Islands, the capital of Kiribati is on the Tarawa archipelago, and lies to the west of Howland.http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/distances.html?n=3400 Distance calculator. How far is it from Howland Island. After the Pacific Leaders Forum met in August 2009, Kiribati invited the U.S. to add Howland and Baker to its Phoenix Islands Protected Area to create its Phoenix Ocean Arc concept. In November 2014, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell joined Republic of Kiribati President Anote Tong to sign a Cooperative Arrangement to coordinate and jointly support research and conservation activities for nearly 490,000 square nautical miles in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (Monument) in the United States and the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in Kiribati.http://www.phoenixislands.org/shownews.php?newsId=90  Boundary enforcement  In 2005, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a $3,000,000 purse seiner two miles from the Howland-Baker EEZ border with Kiribati, and a year later the case went to the federal District Court of Guam. The jurisdiction in Guam is provided by the 1976 Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  At the corner of the world  Based on nautical time, the Howland and Baker islands are the last part of the U.S. to bring in the New Year, being the only territory of the U.S. in UTC−12. They are 24 hours behind the Wake Island Time Zone. The area is also in the equatorial band above which satellites can remain in geosynchronous earth orbit, and NSS-9 is above. In 1964, Syncom 3 was positioned on the International Date Line at the equator, a point from Howland, and into space. Syncom 3 was the first geostationary satellite, and was used to convey live TV coverage of the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics.  PTWC warning point  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issues tsunami warnings for \\"Howland-Baker\\", with the name of the \\"Warning Point\\" as \\"HOWLAND_IS.\\".  Under a Jarvis Moon  The colonization of Jarvis, Howland, and Baker islands by a few Hawaiians and military personnel in 1935 was followed a year later by the claim of possession by Franklin D. Roosevelt in May 1936. Canton Island and Enderbury Island, now a part of Kiribati, were colonized in March 1938. An 88-minute documentary, Under a Jarvis Moon (2010) captures the story of the 130 Americans who colonized these islands between March 1935 and February 1942. The settlers lived on the islands for 3- to 4-month shifts. This colonization was kept secret until Franklin Roosevelt claimed these islands as the territory of the United States in May 1936. It was these settlers who prepared the airstrip for Amelia Earhart. The colonization came to an end on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Howland and Baker were bombed, and two of the four colonists on Howland died. Although Wake Island was also bombed on December 8, Wake is west of the International Date Line, and the attack on Wake occurred only a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The last of the colonists on Jarvis, Howland, Baker, and Enderbury islands were removed in February 1942. Canton, on the other hand, had become a refueling point for commercial aviation by 1939, received a military presence during World War II,http://www.janeresture.com/kiribati_phoenix_group/canton.htm and remains populated as of 2010.

In this episode Michael, Lincoln, Sucre and Bellick tunnel into the Company's headquarters. Gretchen meets with The General. Michael's condition continues to deteriorate. The police question T-Bag regarding Andrew's disappearance. Wyatt propositions Sara while Mahone awaits his shot at his son's killer. Sadly, a great member makes the ultimate sacrifice for the team.  Plot  = At the warehouse = At the warehouse, Agent Self, Mahone, and Sara are deciding what to do with Wyatt. Self figures out a way to record Wyatt's voice onto a recorder and edit it to send a message to General Krantz that Lincoln and Michael are dead. The General believes the message, when Gretchen breaks into his office at this time and puts a gun on him. The General says that he wants Gretchen to work for him once again and that everything that happened was all part of his plan. Gretchen apparently complies, and hears about Scylla being moved. After the message from Wyatt goes out to the General, Self and Sara leave the warehouse so that Mahone can be alone with Wyatt. Mahone begins to torture him in revenge for the death of his son. Threatening further torture, Mahone forces Wyatt to call Pam and apologize for killing their son, realizing Wyatt now has an epiphany for the misdeed he's done. Mahone then takes Wyatt out to the harbour with a cinder block tied to his arms. Wyatt says, \\"You and I are the same Alex...I've done things-\\" but Mahone ignores him and pushes him into the water mid-sentence. = At GATE = Back at GATE Corporation, T-Bag's boss returns from his trip and discovers that T-Bag's co-worker Andrew is missing. He calls the police and a detective comes and asks T-Bag questions about Andrew and his relationship with him. After running out of options, T-Bag pulls his own falsified records and presents them to his boss as Andrew's, stating that Andrew's sales records are falsified and that it could cause a lot of trouble for the company if investigated. This makes his boss call off the investigation and T-Bag's involvement in Andrew's murder is covered up. = Beneath GATE = Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Bellick follow the blueprints from the bird book underneath GATE Corporation that leads them to a main water conduit. After failing to dig underneath the pipe, they decide to tunnel through it and into the Company headquarters. While Lincoln and Bellick are sabotaging the water main, Michael begins having severe health problems and Sucre is forced to cut into the water main on his own. Lincoln and Bellick return to place a pipe through the tunnel just before the water is turned back on. However, the pipe slips, and Bellick, knowing what the end result will be, decides to jump into the conduit. With Bellick hoisting the pipe from the inside of the water main, the pipe is successfully installed, but thus Bellick traps himself inside and subsequently sacrifices himself, so the team can continue.  Reception  IGN gave the episode 8.8/10 saying that \\"Featuring several dramatic highs and two major character deaths, this episode continues the Prison Break tradition of not shying away from killing off major characters\\". As a result, the episode also received the IGN Editors Choice Award.

The house is multi- part, gable-roofed, brick and stone dwelling house constructed probably in the mid-late 1840s, with elements of the Greek Revival style. History The land that made up the Melford plantation was part of a tract, originally called Howerton's Range which was a 400-acre parcel that John Howerton obtained in 1670. Melford was built by Dr. Richard Duckett in 1810. Melford was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Grounds The grounds include three outbuildings: a three-bay gable-roofed slave quarter probably dating from the 18th century; a pyramidal-roofed meat house also dating from the late 18th century; and a 20th-century pyramidal-roofed pump house. The landscape consists of terraced gardens, falling away from the house on three levels. Melford was home for 140 years to two prominent local families, the Ducketts and the Hardestys.

History The first station at Bramford was opened by the Ipswich and Bury Railway on 24 December 1846. It was an all timber affair designed by Frederick Barnes and was situated on an embankment to the north of the Bramford to Ipswich Road. On the down side (from London Liverpool Street) the platform was reached by some steep wooden steps whilst on the up side a slope was the means of access to the platform. The station was badly damaged by gales in February 1860 with part of the building demolished and strewn across the tracks. Such were the changes in the railway industry that in 1847 the Ipswich and Bury Railway became part of the Eastern Union Railway which itself became part of the Eastern Counties Railway in 1854. The Great Eastern Railway took over operation of the station in 1862.Great Eastern Railway Pages 234 - 239 by Cecil J Allen (Ian Allan 1955) At 3:00 p.m. on 1 August 1911 the down platform caught fire and despite the efforts of local railway staff and villagers by 5:30 there was little left of the down side platform. A number of cottages located at the bottom of the embankment were also damaged (the site of a car show room in 2012).Great Eastern Railway Society Journal 69 Pages 21-3 David Chappell (January 1992) The signal box - a little further to the north - was undamaged as was the goods shed located opposite. The second Bramford station opened and was located on the other side of the road underbridge. Its construction was approved by the Great Eastern Railway works committee in 1912 and opened in 1913. The station was a substantial brick affair with the station building on the up side and a small shelter on the down side. A new signal box was also provided at this time. However, in 1919 the goods shed also burnt down (probably due to sparks or ash from a passing train). The Bradshaws Railway guide for July 1922 shows down services for Bury St Edmunds and Norwich (generally calling all stations) calling at Bramford. Up services generally terminated at Ipswich.Bradshaws July 1922 Railway Guide Tables 274 and 286 (reprint David and Charles 1985) In 1923 the Great Eastern Railway amalgamated with other railway companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway. Two years later the signal box (1912) was abolished being replaced by a new signal box located at Sproughton Sidings some 46 chains closer to Ipswich. On nationalisation in 1948 the station and its services became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station was closed with the last train calling on 2 May 1955. In 1950s the goods yard - in reality a loop off the main line - was handling very little traffic and it lasted until the 1960s. The station was demolished in 1965 and the only remains today are the old track up to the up platform of the original station.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal 106 Pages 28-31 David Chappell (April 2001) Fisons Ltd siding A large rail connected chemical works was situated one mile north of Bramford railway station. Opened by Packard and Co in 1851 and situated between the railway and the B1067 (although one siding crossed that road and served a sand quarry). Rail traffic ceased c 1968 with the rails lifted soon after although some inset track remained in the yard in 2013. A narrow gauge railway was situated in the quarry until 1948.Fisher states this was a sand pit whilst Adderson and Kenworthy state a chalk pit This location also had a signal box called \\"Lime Works\\" which closed on 26 June 1968 presumably when, or soon after, rail traffic to the sidings ceased.

It is often a site for public gathering or for demonstrations and festivals, notably, the Meskel Festival from which it takes its name. Overview The Meskel Festival has been celebrated for over 1,600 years. The word \\"Meskel\\" means \\"cross\\" and the festival commemorates the moment when the crucifix was revealed to Empress Helena of Constantinople, mother of Constantine the Great. The festival is also seen as a moment to welcome in the spring season by displaying the distinctive yellow Meskel daisies. Thousands gather at the Square annually on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27 in the Gregorian calendar), with celebrations in Addis Ababa beginning in the early afternoon when a procession bearing flaming torches approaches Meskel Square from various directions. A burning pyramid (demera) is located in the center and is circled by priests in brightly colored cloaks, students, brass bands, and the army carrying around giant crosses and torches. They set the pyramid alight with their torches, and the burning pyramid is kept ablaze until dawn until the celebrations through the night have ended.  History  Traditionally, the Meskel bonfire in Addis Ababa was lit by the Emperor of Ethiopia accompanied by members of the Imperial family, the nobility and high officials of the Orthodox Church and the government. The bonfire was initially lit in the square near the southern gate of St George's Cathedral during the reigns of Emperor Menelik II and Empress Zewditu, but was moved to its present location in the specifically constructed Meskel Square by Emperor Haile Selassie. Following the fall of the monarchy in 1974, Meskel Square was renamed \\"Abyot\\" or Revolution Square. It was greatly expanded so that it could accommodate the annual Revolution Day and May Day parades on September 12 and May 1. Three gigantic portraits of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin were erected in the square. The population of Addis Ababa would joke that these were the \\"new trinity\\". Meskel bonfires continued to be lit there however for a number of years, with the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church lighting the bonfire in place of the Emperor. Between 1988 and 1991, the officially atheist government ordered the Meskel celebration to be moved back to the small square outside the southern gates of St. George Cathedral. After the fall of Mengistu Haile Mariam, the short lived government of General Tesfaye Gebre Kidan restored the original name of Meskel Square, and the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front government returned the Meskel celebration to the square. The square is often used for other secular purposes. Concerts, parades, car races, and various other government and public events are held there. Political parties often hold rallies in the square. Part of the public ceremonies surrounding the re-burial of Emperor Haile Selassie took place in the square as well. The annual \\"Great Ethiopian Run\\" passes through Meskel Square. The national monument in memory of those massacred by the Derg regime in the \\"Red Terror\\" of the 1970s has been built at the eastern entrance to the square, and the remains of many victims from that period have been buried there : the Red Terror Martyrs Memorial Museum has been inaugurated in February 2010. On 6 August 2016 hundreds of protesters marched on Meskel Square during the 2016 Ethiopian protests and shouted \\"we want our freedom\\" and \\"free our political prisoners.\\"Dozens killed in new wave of Ethiopia protests,AFP  08 August, 2016 18:26, http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2016/08/08/Dozens-killed-in-new- wave-of-Ethiopia-protests References Category:Squares in Addis Ababa Category:National squares ","title":"Meskel Square"},{"id":"20024652","text":"\\"The Legend\\" is the 67th episode of the American television series Prison Break and was broadcast on November 10, 2008 in the United States on the Fox Network.http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20081024fox02 Plot The team members are angered when they find out that Agent Self is refusing to return Bellick's body to his mother. Sucre attacks him and Mahone threatens to call off the operation to uncover Scylla if Self goes back on his word. Self reluctantly agrees but warns Sucre to never attack him again or risk death. Michael and Self meet with Gretchen, who gives them the remaining pages from the bird book and lets them know that Scylla is being moved to a bunker in Pennsylvania the following day.

At the warehouse, Michael collapses again, forcing Sara to rush him to the hospital under fake identities. Michael is brought in for a CT scan as Sara patiently waits outside. In Michael's absence, Mahone heads to David Baker's house and is let in after he mentions Scylla. In the GATE basement, Lincoln and Sucre are looking for a way into the Company headquarters when Sucre accidentally steps on a trigger, possibly a land mine, which starts beeping. If he moves, it may go off and harm them both. At David Baker's house, after enquiring about Baker's model of a self-sufficient city comparable to the real-world Venus Project, Mahone is probed on his involvement with the Company, thereby betraying his purpose at the house while Baker insists that he has cut all ties to the Company. Back at GATE, T-Bag begins to deliver a much-practiced speech in front of potential clients, before breaking into a passionate, half-true speech about how he volunteered in prison and was friends with a CO named Brad, in honour of Bellick's memory. The hospital is looking to admit Michael but he refuses treatment. Sara asks Michael to reconsider, but both are spooked when they spot the police in the hospital and hurriedly leave, asking the doctor to call back with the test results later. Meanwhile, agents from The Company barge into David Baker's house as Mahone is begging Baker for help. Mahone tries to take a call from Lincoln before hanging up as he spots the Company agents approaching; he hurriedly tries to bring Baker around then runs before Baker is captured and backup agents sweep the grounds for signs of an intruder. While fleeing, Mahone is met with Baker's wife, who delivers a legend for the blueprint and drives off. Unable to reach Michael or Mahone, Lincoln drags Gretchen into the tunnels. Gretchen recognizes the type of land mine and orders Sucre to change the distribution of his weight on the trigger, so that she can disarm the firing pin. Lincoln and Sucre are distrustful of her, but she points out that she is risking her own life as well. After meeting up back at the warehouse, Michael and Mahone decode the blueprint, only to realize that Sucre isn't just stepping on a land mine, but also on an alarm trigger. Mahone rushes to GATE to stop them from dismantling the bomb, which will set off the alarm. He manually overrides the system and tells Sucre to step off the trigger, who eventually does so with great reluctance. Everyone meets back up at the warehouse where they are met with Bellick's body, dressed in a proper suit, and placed in a coffin to be sent home to his mother for burial. Mahone places a police shield on Bellick's chest. Sucre makes the phone call to Bellick's mother, as he promised that he would in the event that anything happened to him. T-Bag discovers Trishanne's identity when he calls a number on Trishanne's resume and is greeted by Self's voice on the other end of the line. Sara gives Michael his medical results: he has a Hypothalamus Tumor that has been growing and requires surgery. Michael asks for two days, but Sara tells him that he only has one - he has to have surgery tomorrow or he runs the risk of dying. In the T-Bag speech scene, Prison Break writers Nick Santora, Matt Olmstead, Zack Estrin, Karyn Usher, Seth Hoffman and others appear, presumably in a tribute to Bellick's character.  Reception  IGN gave the episode 8.8/10 saying that \\"the writers chose the right material to include in the episode\\" and that there were \\"great character moments in- between the action\\". As a result, the episode also received the IGN Editors Choice Award.

It includes records of over 10 million cultural and scientific artefacts, brought together on a single platform and presented in a variety of ways relevant to modern users. The prototype for Europeana was the European Digital Library Network (EDLnet), launched in 2008. The Europeana Foundation is the governing body of the service, and is incorporated under Dutch law as Stichting Europeana.  History  Europeana had its beginnings after a letter was jointly sent in April 2005 by Jacques Chirac, President of France, and the premiers of Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and Hungary to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso. It urged the creation of a virtual European library in order to make Europe's cultural heritage more accessible to everyone.\\"Timeline of digitisation and online accessibility of cultural heritage\\" (23 July 2014). European Commission, Digital Agenda for Europe. The letter, written in French, was dated 28 April 2005 (see under that date in timeline): ec.europa.eu. Retrieved 2015-05-19. The letter helped to give added support to work that the European Commission's Information Society and Media Directorate had had already been conducting over the previous ten years, such as the Telematics for Libraries project. It also offered strong political support to the Directorate's strategy (i2010: communication on digital libraries), published in September 2005. This made clear the intention to create and support a European digital library, covering the whole European Union in order to encourage growth of the information society and related media industries.European Commission (30 September 2005). Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. i2010: Digital Libraries p. 3. Retrieved 2015-05-19. The first project that started the building of Europeana was the European Digital Library Network (EDLnet), whose role was to establish a prototype model for a user-focussed service, capable of working across national borders and across differing domains. The European Commission funded EDLnet from its eContentplus programme. The European Digital Library Network prototype was launched on 20 November 2008. It initially provided access to 4.5 million digital objects, which was twice as many as initially intended, and received data contributions from over a thousand separate organisations, including many internationally renowned libraries, gallery and museum collections from many different European capital cities. The successor of EDLnet (Europeana version 1.0) began life in February 2009. It ran for 2.5 years and, by 2010, the initial prototype had developed into a full service, providing access to over 10 million digital records of cultural objects. New features were added in 2011, including a translation tool and a function to expand searches onto other platforms, including Wikipedia.  Function and description Europeana contains digitalised museum collections. Europeana gives access to different types of content from different types of heritage institutions. The digital objects that users can find in Europeana are not stored on a central computer, but remain with the cultural institution and are hosted on their networks. Europeana collects contextual information – or metadata – about the items, including a small picture. Users search this contextual information. Once they find what they are looking for, if they want to access the full content of the item, they can click through to the original site that holds the content. Different types of cultural heritage organisations – libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections – catalogue their content in different ways and to different standards. Approaches also vary in different countries. To make the information searchable, it has to be mapped to a single common standard, known as the Europeana Semantic Elements, and based on Dublin Core. This metadata standard at present takes a lowest common denominator approach to the integration of different types of digital content. In 2010 the Europeana Data Model, a richer metadata standard, was introduced to help give users more and better information. Europeana accepts metadata about digital objects, it does not make any decisions about digitisation. The decision about which objects are digitised lies with the organisation that holds the material. More than 3,000 institutions across Europe have contributed to Europeana, including the Rijksmuseum, the British Library and the Louvre.List of partners and contributors List of partners and contributors , Europeana.eu. Accessed 2 February 2011. Records of over 10 million cultural and scientific artefacts have been brought together on Europeana's platform, and are presented in a variety of ways relevant to modern users, such as smartphones or APIs.  Strategy  In its Strategic Plan for 2011–2015, which was published in January 2011, Europeana outlined four strategic tracks that would shape its further development: # Aggregate – to build the open trusted source for European cultural and scientific heritage content; # Facilitate – to support the cultural and scientific heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy; # Distribute – to make heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it; # Engage – to cultivate new ways for users to participate in their cultural and scientific heritage. The subsequent strategy document is for the period 2015-2020.  Organisation  The Europeana Foundation is the governing body of the Europeana service. Its members are the presidents and chairs of European associations for cultural heritage and information associations. The Foundation promotes collaboration between museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries so that users can have integrated access to their content through Europeana and other services. The Foundation is incorporated under Dutch law as Stichting EuropeanaStichting Europeana, Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce, Netherlands) (KvK) number 27307531, located at Prins Willem-Alexanderhof 5, 's-Gravenhage (The Hague). and is housed within the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, the national library of the Netherlands. It provides a legal framework for the governance of Europeana, employing the staff, bidding for funding and enabling the sustainability of the service. The executive director of the Europeana Foundation is Harry Verwayen.

It is a -story, Flemish bond brick structure, with Georgian details. As of 2009, it is undergoing an extensive restoration. This unique dwelling was visited by George Washington on several occasions and the British Army camped here during their march to Washington, D.C. in August 1814, during the War of 1812. Melwood Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Ownership history The house is significant for its early owners, some of the most prominent men in all phases of the life of colonial Maryland; the Digges, Carroll, and Lee families. The home was originally believed to have been built by Ignatius Digges (1707–1785) c. 1750, and subsequently raised to its present two stories by his widow, Mary Carroll Digges, in about 1800. Recent dendrochronology performed on the roof rafters of Melwood Park suggest an earlier construction date. The confirmed felling date of the timbers used in construction of the roof date to the winter of 1713 and spring of 1714. At the time Melwood Park was owned by Henry Darnell Jr. (1682–1737) who owned an adjacent plantation known as His Lordship's Kindness. His father, Henry Darnall (1645–1711), had earlier built nearby \\"The Woodyard.\\" The original Melwood Park land patent was for of which half were eventually inherited by the Digges family. William Digges, who inherited half of the property purchased the half where the manor house was located in 1729. Ignatius Digges, son of William, inherited Melwood from his father in 1740. Ignatius Digges left the plantation to his wife, Mary Carroll Digges, who went on to live at Melwood Park for the next 40 years after his death in 1785. Ignatius Digges grandson Ignatius Digges Lee, son of his daughter Mary (1745–1805) who was wife of Maryland Governor Thomas Sim Lee (1745–1819), was scheduled to inherit Melwood Park, but predeceased his grandmother. Lee and his wife were buried at Melwood Park until moved to a nearby Catholic cemetery in 1888. Melwood Park was sold to William Pumphrey in about 1825, following the death of Mary. The current owner now is Mellwood Parke Foundation. Mellwood Parke is now managed by William C. Hendricks, as executive director. Structure history =Exterior= The 1713–1714 dwelling was a timber framed structure approximately , 6 inches by , with an ell of equal size situated on the north side. This first dwelling was one and a half stories. This dwelling had an riven oak clapboard roof sheathing, a 17:12 pitched roof and likely clapboard siding. No drawings of the original structure have been located, nor are there references to this building in land records. However, the evidence of this original structure is present in the dwelling today. Further dendrochronology performed in the roof structure indicated that significant changes were made to the building between 1767 and 1768. These changes include; extending the dwelling on the east by and on the west by , extending the loft to a full story across the south facade only, the addition of two outward flanking chimney stacks, encasing the south facing facade with brick nogging and a veneer brick, adding 16/16 common sliding sash windows of the first floor and 9/9 common sliding sash windows on the second floor. The veneer brick and addition of solid masonry were set in an artful Flemish bond pattern with glazed headers, queen course and oyster shell lime mortar with a grapevine joint. During this expansion it is assumed that the northward ell was not modified, however this portion of the building was removed in a subsequent renovation likely to have occurred circa 1897. =Interior= The interiors of Melwood Park are as impressive as the exterior. The dining room was paneled wood from floor to ceiling, similar detailing is used throughout the dwelling. Recent paint analysis of the interior indicates that Ignatius Digges painted the renovated interior all one color, a rust red, common to the era with a high gloss varnished finish to aid in the reflectance of light. It appears likely that his wife Mary redecorated the interiors shortly after his death in 1785, completing her cosmetic changes sometime after 1800. Further paint analysis has revealed that the second finish applied to the wood work inside the dwelling was very bright and colorful. She appears to have chosen colors common to the wealthy of her day; Verdigris and Prussian blue among the color recently discovered. The Verdigris color in the central or entry hall of the house was applied in an unusual way, there are distinct layers, 7 to be exact, of color that is translucent. This was then covered with at least 3 layers of a translucent tinted varnish. The effect would have been magnificent and would today be very difficult to replicate. The Prussian blue seen in the east parlor (sometimes referred to as the dining room is dated to after 1800 due to the fact that a chemical which made the pigment more opaque was added to the paint, this chemical was not discovered or available in the United States until after 1800.

It is a dystopia that relates the life of Paul, a practitioner of a mysterious operation who is greatly disturbed by its practice. Main themes touch upon one's place in the society and the arbitrariness of governments policies which set up the norm against one's morale. Ravenhill's The Cut is not to be confused with the Mike Cullen play of the same name. Plot summary As the play unravels, the cut is presented as a painful, immoral, controversial and ambiguous surgery, that cures a patient or victim from desire, or maybe even personality. It is apparently destined to dissidents and/or sick people but its virtues also make it attractive as a mean of freedom and salvation. The cut is pictured as a death of some sort, but leaving open to interpretation what part of the patient is dying. In the first part, Paul is reluctant to administrate the cut to a willing patient, and in the course of his frustrations and failure to convince him otherwise, let explode his angst and impotency to commit suicide, confessing in particular his deficient relationship with his wife. In the second part, Paul is shown in the context that seems to put the most strain on him: his family life. We see him waiting for and having dinner with his wife, from whom he his holding secret--out of guilt--the real nature of his activities for the government. The two have a conversation that progresses from chit-chat to a maddening and humiliating confrontation. In the last part, Paul is in jail as a result of the cut being banished from a new Government, and is visited by his son, with whom he shares an equally emotionally disturbed and alienated conversation.

It closed to passengers in 1963. The goods facility for Blue Circle Cement, British Steel Piling and Kings Scrapyard was still staffed in the late 1970s with the staff working from the former up side station buildings. History The station was opened on 30 November 1849 when the Ipswich and Bury Railway started operation. Initially opened for goods traffic, passenger services commenced on 23 December the same year. The station building was designed by Frederick Barnes who designed a number of stations along the route. Its design is similar to Elmswell railway station which is still extant today (2014). At the west end of the station, which had two platforms, the line was crossed by the Ipswich to Stowmarket Road although that traffic is now carried on the A14, the level crossing is still quite busy with local traffic. The Ipswich and Bury Railway was soon merged to become part of the Eastern Union Railway (with whom it shared a number of directors) and this was then taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1854. although these two companies did not formally merge until they amalgamated with other railways to form the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. The Bradshaws Railway guide for July 1922 shows down services for Bury St Edmunds and Norwich (generally calling all stations) calling at Claydon. Up services generally terminated at Ipswich calling at Bramford.Bradshaws July 1922 Railway Guide Tables 274 and 286 (reprint David and Charles 1985) In 1923 operation of the station became the responsibility of the London and North Eastern Railway following the 1923 grouping. On 1 February 1941 the adjacent cement works (see section below) was bombed during the second world war. On nationalisation operation of the station became the responsibility of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station was closed to passengers on 17 June 1963 and the goods yard was closed on 31 March 1971. The down side platforms and structures were demolished soon after closure to passengers to enable the railway layout in the cement factory to be extended. The main building on the upside survived until 1992 although it was demolished despite efforts to have it listed. The signal box lasted until 1986 when following re-signalling of the main line, electrification and the replacement of the old level crossing barriers by new remote controlled barriers, it had become redundant. Goods Sidings The station had a number of goods facilities. Behind the up platform (towards Ipswich and Liverpool Street) there was a railway owned goods yard which included a private coal siding operated by Ipswich Coal merchant Thomas Moy. A cement factory operated by George Mason & Co (sometimes referred to as Masons) was established in the 1913 on the down side of the station. It is unclear whether it was rail connected in 1913 but maps of 1926 show it was rail connected with rail traffic continuing until the closure of the factory in 1999. In 1948 operation of the factory was taken over by APCM (Blue Circle Cement). The company operated a number of quarries in the area which were served by narrow gauge railways. On the west side of the level crossing on the down side of the line a second goods yard was established in the First World War (1916-1918) and there were used as a railhead for aviation fuel for nearby RAF Wattisham during the Second World War (1939-1945). Later a scrap yard operated at this location. In 1921 on the down side of the line west of the crossing the Zenith Works of the British Steel Piling Co Ltd was established. Rail traffic lasted until 1973 with the connection being removed in 1976 although some track was extant in 1986. About a mile west of the level crossing there is an active (in 2014) aggregates terminal on the up side of the line. Re-opening? Plans to redevelop one of the old cement factory quarries into an indoor ski resort called SnOasis have led to suggestions that the station may re-open although whether it will be in the same site due to its proximity to the level crossing is unknown. However, there seems little evidence the project will go ahead in 2014 so it may be some years before the station is reopened. References External links * Claydon station on navigable 1946 O.

An endurocross course is much faster than a trials course and much slower than a supercross course. History The indoor enduro debuted in 2000 as a support event to the Barcelona Trial Indoor, organized by Jaime Alguersuari Sr. The hybrid sport expanded to other European cities in the 2000s. In 2007, the FIM created the FIM Indoor Enduro World Cup, later named the FIM Indoor Enduro World Championship but now renamed to the FIM SuperEnduro World Championship, which despite the name had only been held in Europe until the 2013/14 season. Endurocross in the United States was founded by Eric Peronnard, responsible for the US Open of Motocross and the Supercross Paris-Bercy. It was originally held as a one-off event called EnduroCross at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The race was expanded into the AMA EnduroCross Championship in 2007. An AMA EnduroCross round was added to the X Games Los Angeles for the 2011 and 2012 editions. In 2013, the four X Games summer games featured endurocross rounds, and did not award points for the AMA EnduroCross Championship. The X Games endurocross events are also organized by Peronnard.

Beatrix was born in Italy towards the end of 1037 as the only child of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III and his first wife, Gunhilda of Denmark, who died about six months after Beatrice's birth.  Reign as princess-abbess  = Consecration = On 14 January 1044, after the death of her kinswoman, Abbess Adelaide I, Beatrice was installed as Abbess of Gandersheim Abbey by her father, overriding the right of the canonesses to elect their own head. She was additionally consecrated Abbess of Quedlinburg on 24 June 1044 in Merseburg Cathedral, also succeeding Adelaide I, and a little later was created abbess of . = Conflicts = In Gandersheim, she was at the centre of a long-running conflict with the canonesses, who accused her of subinfeudating estates of the abbey that were intended for the direct support of the community, and thereby bringing them into financial hardship. Three popes were involved in this affair, which went on for years: Leo IX decided initially in favour of the canonesses; Victor II reversed the decision in favour of the abbess. Finally, Stephen IX set out a compromise, at the end of 1057, which was apparently that the prebendal estates of the community were to be reserved for its upkeep, but that the abbess had the right to manage freely the remaining estates and her own properties as she saw fit. Even this solution held only until the death of Beatrice; under her successor, her half- sister Adelaide II, the conflict broke out all over again.  Death  Beatrice died on 13 July 1061. She was buried in the abbey church of Quedlinburg but her remains must have been removed elsewhere after the disastrous fire of 1070. A lead casket, which almost certainly contains the bones of Beatrice, has been preserved in Michaelstein Abbey since about 1161. In the crypt of the rebuilt church at Quedlinburg a tablet from the time of its rededication in 1129 serves as Beatrice's memorial.

It is an elegantly detailed -story Georgian/Federal- style, Flemish bond brick house, probably built about 1760 and substantially renovated in the late 1790s, by Enoch Magruder and his son, Dennis of Harmony Hall. The house was occupied by the Rev. Jonathan Boucher from 1771-73 who described it as \\"a very tolerable house\\" in his Reminiscences of an American Loyalist, and remarked that his pupils dubbed the house \\"Castle Magruder.\\" Among Boucher's students was Jackie Custis, George Washington's step-son, who lived with Boucher at Mount Lubentia during this period. George and Martha Washington visited on several occasions, as related in Washington's diary. Forrest Bowie, a direct descendant of Enoch Magruder, stated in an article written in the late 1930s that family tradition held that Dennis Magruder was born at Mount Lubentia in 1759. He was given the house and property by his father upon his marriage in 1779, when serving in the Maryland Line during the Revolutionary War. During the course of restoration by the owner over the past 15 years, evidence of earlier configuration, materials and finish has been discovered beneath the late 18th and early 19th century work now evident. Also on the property and of significance in and of itself is the octagonal frame dairy which was moved onto the property in the 1970s from a nearby former plantation, \\"Graden.\\" The dairy is the best surviving example of an architecturally conscious domestic outbuilding of the 18th century in the county, and possibly in the state. Also on the property is an 18th-century corncrib, described in the 1798 tax records. Mount Lubentia was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

As Wilhelm Schmidt's superheater went into series production, Karl Gölsdorf modified the Class 329 into the superheated variant 429. The smokebox was lengthened, the boiler barrel reduced accordingly, high-pressure cylinders were given piston valves, the low-pressure cylinders slide valves. The Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf, the Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik and the Lokomotivfabrik der StEG delivered 57 units (429.01–57) to the kkStB. In spite of the small superheater area, problems arose with the slide valves on the low-pressure side. As a result, the following 126 engines were supplied with piston valves on both sides (429.100–225). At the same time a two-cylinder variant with piston valves was tried, of which in the end 197 units were procured by the kkStB (429.900–999 and 429.1900–1996). The Austrian Southern Railway procured six compound locomotives (with piston valves), that were numbered 429.01–06. The 429s were employed for all duties and with good coal generated up to . They were to be found in almost all parts of the Danube Monarchy. After the First World War the former 429s became Class 354.7 with the ČSD, Class Ol12 in the PKP, Class 106 in the JDŽ, Class 688 in the FS and were also used by the Romanian State Railways retaining their original numbers. A total of 87 units (46 compound, 41 two-cylinder locomotives) remained in the BBÖ. In 1939 the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) reclassified the two-cylinder engines as 35 201–241 and the compounds as 35 301–346. During the course of the war, several locomotives from the ČSD and JDŽ ended up in the DRB. After the Second World War 46 two- cylinder machines were left in the ÖBB and became their Class 35, as well as 39 compound engines which became Class 135. The serial numbers were not changed from those allocated by the DRB.  ČSD Class 354.7  The ČSD in Czechoslovakia converted all its compound locomotives (27 of the first series, 57 of the second) into two-cylinder engines. Together with the 68 two- cylinder machines taken over, they therefore had over 152 examples of Class 354.7. With the exception of one engine, all the locomotives were give a second steam dome with a connecting pipe. The ČSD did not withdraw Class 354.7 engines from its fleet until 1967.

He was excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church because his satire targeted many of the church's prominent members.  Biography  Andreas Laskaratos was born in Lixouri in 1811, at the time when the Ionian islands were moving from the French to the British as a protectorate. He was considered to be highly spirited by nature, intelligent and glib. He was intensely satirical and constant in his views, publishing works which contrasted the views of his time. The fact that he did not hesitate to freely express his views by criticizing hypocrisy became the main reason behind his arrest and imprisonment, persecutions, and excommunication by the church. He lived through the entire process of unification of the Ionian islands with mainland Greece but he distanced himself from the opinions of most leaders of the pro-unification movement. During his persecution he lived at times in Corfu, Zakynthos, London and Argostoli, where he died in 1901. Being brought up in a wealthy aristocratic family of land-owners, he studied law in Paris, but only practised law when he was in financial need. He was the student of the great poet Andreas Kalvos and also met Greece's 'national poet' Dionysios Solomos, both of whom influenced his later course. He worked as a journalist and published poetry but is more well known as a writer of satire. He married Penelope Korgialeniou (Πηνελόπη Κοργιαλένιου), also from a wealthy family, who bore him two sons and seven daughters. His niece Eleni Lambiri was a conductor, librettist and composer. He published several satirical newspapers such as Lychnos (Λύχνος) that criticized immorality, injustice and hypocrisy. On many occasions he turned against politicians and their incompetence while he also fought against religious prejudices and the corruption of religious authority. His main works include: * (Τα μυστήρια της Κεφαλονιάς) \\"The mysteries of Cephalonia\\" * (Ιδού ο άνθρωπος ή ανθρώπινοι χαρακτήρες) \\"Ecce homo or human characters\\" * (Ποιήματα και ανέκδοτα) \\"Poems and anecdotes\\" * (Οι καταδρομές μου εξαιτίας του «Λύχνου») \\"The troubles Lychnos caused me\\" * (Απόκριση στον αφορισμό) \\"Response to aphorism\\" *Aftoviografia (Αυτοβιογραφία) \\"Autobiography\\"  Anecdotal Incidents  * On his birthday, a neighbour in order to make fun of him sent him a basket full of goat's horns (implying his wife's adultery) with the inscription \\"For your birthday\\".

Early life David Wilkinson was born at Smithfield, Rhode Island in 1771, the son of Oziel Wilkinson, a skilled blacksmith who moved his family to Pawtucket in the 1780s. About 1784, his father, Oziel began making anchors in Pawtucket for the emerging shipbuilding industry. The shop was powered by water from the Blackstone River, and was located on the grounds of the present-day Slater Mill Historic Site. Industrial career In 1790, Samuel Slater and his partners were interested in building a textile spinning mill in Pawtucket he sought the assistance of David Wilkinson and his father Oziel to produce the machinery for his new mill. They produced iron forgings and castings for Slater's carding and spinning machines. > “all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by Mr. Slater > was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand > power”. David Wilkinson In 1793 Slater's operations were moved from a clothier's shop near the Pawtucket Falls to a new mill, which today is part of the Slater Mill Historic Site.http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5659.pdf The Wilkinson Mill brochure, Gary Kulik and Patrick M. Malone, October 12, 1977 In 1795 Oziel Wilkinson built a rolling and slitting mill just south of Slater's cotton mill. Both mills were powered with water from the same trench. Wilkinson lathe Textile machinery manufacturer and scientific writer Zachariah Allen had the following to say about Wilkinson's lathe in 1861: > “It has to this day proved the most effective tool placed within the control > of mankind for shaping refractory metals and for accomplishing the triumph > of mind over matter. The slide engine is employed in the great machine shops > of America and Europe.” Ross Tompson (2009) on the importance of Wilkinson's lathe: page=262 :'In his \\"Reminiscences\\", Wilkinson claimed his lathe was: > \\"worth all the other tools in use, in any workshop in the world, for > finishing [machining] brass and iron\\" On the versatility of his lathe Wilkinson said: > \\"The weighted side, the joint made by gravity, applies to planing, turning, > and boring of metals of every kind, and in every way.\\" An 1848 report from the Committee on Military Affairs to the U.S. Senate highlighted the importance of Wilkinson's invention, for which the patent had expired in 1812: > \\"Being left open to general use, an invention so vastly important in its > character could not fail to be sought after, not only in the public at > large, but also by agents of the government engaged in the fabrication of > arms of various descriptions; and hence we find the gauge and sliding lathe > was early introduced and made use of by all the arsenals and armories of the > United States.\\" The report went on to say 'Wilkinson was the \\"true and undisputed author\\" of the lathe, and that it was \\"indispensable\\" for making firearms, and that public armories used 200 lathes based on the invention. The report recommended a $10,000 reward, which he was given. Wilkinson failed to generate much income from his lathe. Records exist for the sale of one lathe and a few parts. David Wilkinson's lathe is often compared to Henry Maudslay's which is believed to have been invented a few years before Wilkinson's. Maudslay's lathe used change gears which allowed it to cut threads of various pitches, without which Wilkinson's could only cut a fixed pitch. Wilkinson's lathe could handle heavier work. Wilkinson Mill In 1810, the present-day Wilkinson Mill was built near their existing rolling and slitting mill and Slater's cotton mill. Three and one-half stories tall and constructed from field stones, it contained a machine shop on the first floor and cotton spinning mill on the upper floors. In 1829, during a depression in the textile industry, David Wilkinson was forced to sell his mills. He left Rhode Island settling initially in Cohoes, New York. In 1831 the mill was sold to William Field and Thomas LeFavour. The mill would later be used to produce woolen and knitted textiles. Between 1873 and 1887 Lorenzo P. Bosworth operated a machine shop in the mill. He produced machinery and tools for the leather and jewelry industries.

Background The placement agent acts as an intermediary between those seeking to raise money and those who may be interested in investing. They are typically mandated by fund managers. A few placement agents are structured as groups within large investment banking firms, but more frequently as separate boutique investment banks, sometimes captive to an Alternative Asset management group or specialist fund marketer. Placement agents will often seek to raise capital from a variety of institutional investors (e.g. pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, funds of funds, sovereign wealth funds) as well as family offices and high- net-worth individuals. Some placement agents have an exclusive focus on a particular type of institutional investor (e.g. US pension advisors for corporate and public pension funds). Placement agents are most often compensated through fees based on the amount of money raised (success fee) or supported by the fund or company they are actively representing (retainer fee).

In Civilization and Ethics, Schweitzer wrote: \\"Ethics is nothing other than Reverence for Life. Reverence for Life affords me my fundamental principle of morality, namely, that good consists in maintaining, assisting and enhancing life, and to destroy, to harm or to hinder life is evil.\\" James Brabazon, author of Albert Schweitzer: A Biography, defined Reverence for Life as follows: Schweitzer made Reverence for Life the basic tenet of an ethical philosophy, which he developed and put into practice. He gave expression to its development in numerous books and publications during his life and also in manuscripts which have recently been published; the main work being his unfinished four-part Philosophy of Culture () subtitled: \\"The World-view of Reverence for Life\\". He also used his hospital in Lambaréné, Gabon to demonstrate this philosophy in practice. Origins Albert Schweitzer believed that ethical values which could underpin the ideal of true civilization had to have their foundation in deep thought and be world- and life-affirming. He therefore embarked on a search for ethical values in the various major religions and world-views accessible to him, but could not find any that were able, unequivocally, to combine ethics with life-affirmation. It was not until two years after moving out to Gabon to establish the Albert Schweitzer Hospital that he finally found the simple statement which answered his quest. In his autobiography Out of My Life and Thought, Schweitzer explains this process: \\"Having described how at the beginning of the summer of 1915 he awoke from some kind of mental daze, asking himself why he was only criticizing civilization and not working on something constructive.\\".Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography. [Aus meinem Leben und Denken.] Albert Schweitzer, author. Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p147. He relates how he asked himself the question: > But what is civilization? The essential element in civilization is the > ethical perfecting of the individual as well as society. At the same time, > every spiritual and every material step forward has significance for > civilization. The will to civilization is, then, the universal will to > progress that is conscious of the ethical as the highest value. In spite of > the great importance we attach to the achievements of science and human > prowess, it is obvious that only a humanity that is striving for ethical > ends can benefit in full measure from material progress and can overcome the > dangers that accompany it..... The only possible way out of chaos is for us > to adopt a concept of the world based on the ideal of true civilization. But > what is the nature of that concept of the world in which the will to the > general progress and the will to the ethical progress join and are linked? > It consists in an ethical affirmation of the world and of life.

Emphasis added. > [This edition leaves out the original German phrase, so another edition > needs to be cited as well which contains the German phrase as shown above.] According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development of Reverence for Life, was influenced by Indian religious thought and in particular Jain principle of ahimsa (non-violence).Ara Paul Barsam (2002) \\"Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life\\" in:Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, p. 207-08 Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book Indian Thought and Its Development:Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) Albert Schweitzer: an anthology Beacon Press > The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of > the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its > principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, > ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics > have not progressed very far - reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics > know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly > expressed by Jainism. It should not be overlooked, however, that as a child Schweitzer felt deeply for the suffering of all the creatures around him. He wrote, \\"As far back as I can remember I was saddened by the amount of misery I saw in the world around me. Youth's unqualified joie de vivre I never really knew...One thing especially saddened me was that the unfortunate animals had to suffer so much pain and misery....It was quite incomprehensible to me -- this was before I began going to school -- why in my evening prayers I should pray for human beings only. So when my mother had prayed with me and had kissed me good- night, I used to add silently a prayer that I composed myself for all living creatures. It ran thus: \\"O heavenly Father, protect and bless all things that have breath guard them from all evil, and let them sleep in peace....\\" Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings, compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117-120 Schweitzer twice went fishing with some boys \\"because they asked [him] to\\" and \\"this sports was soon made impossible for me by the treatment of the worms that were put on the hook...and the wrenching of the mouths of the fishes that were caught. I gave it up...From experiences like these, which moved my heart....there slowly grew up in me an unshakeable conviction that we have no right to inflict suffering and death on another living creature, and that we ought all of us to feel what a horrible thing it is to cause suffering and death...\\" Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings, compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117–120 This awareness affected him throughout his life, as when he would carefully, gently scoop a spider out of a hole it had fallen into before planting a crop there, to feed his patients and their families who also worked on the hospital farm. He wrote that, just as our own existence is significant to each of us, \\"[a creature's] existence is significant to it.\\"Reverence for Life: The Words of Albert Schweitzer. compiled by Harold E. Robles. Pub. Harpercollins; 1st edition (October 1993). He wrote that \\"...my relation to my own being and to the objective world is determined by reverence for life. This reverence for life is given as an element of my will-to-live...\\" and this will-to-live existed in all creatures and was to be respected.The Philosophy of Civilization. Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). . p xv. See also this same topic of will-to-live in Out of My Life and Thought. In his book The Philosophy of Civilization, Schweitzer wrote, \\"Ethics are responsibility without limit toward all that lives....Love means more, since it includes fellowship in suffering, in joy, and in effort...The Philosophy of Civilization. Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). . p 317. The will to live Schweitzer held the view in the 1920s that people had largely lost touch with their own will, having subjugated it to outside authority and sacrificed it to external circumstances. The word ‘will’ in the sense of determination or firmness of purpose is rarely used today and therefore Schweitzer’s use of the word as translated from the German word ‘Wille’ may appear unfamiliar. However, it is a significant part of Schweitzer’s message. He therefore pointed back to that elemental part of ourselves that can be in touch with our ‘will’ and can exercise it for the good of all. In Out of My Life and Thought, Schweitzer wrote:A. Schweitzer, Out of my Life and Thought (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 156-157. In his search for an answer to the problems posed by what was to him the obvious decline of western civilization, Albert Schweitzer was not prepared to give up the belief in progress which is so much taken for granted by people of European descent. Rather, he sought to identify why this ‘will to progress’ was seemingly going off the rails and causing the disintegration of European civilization. He came to the following conclusion in Out of my Life and Thought:A. Schweitzer, Out of my Life and Thought (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 152.A.

Winfield has Mercure being named Trompeuse and registered in September 1798. He reports that she was then commissioned into the Royal Navy a year later under Commander John Parker Robinson. However, there was an earlier capture of a privateer Mercure whose dates better fit these facts.

She had sailed from Bordeaux the day before and was a new vessel, copper-bottomed and fastened. French sources are clearer.

It was discovered together with the nickel sulfide vaesite by Johannes F. Vaes, a Belgian mineralologist and named after Felicien Cattier, Chairman of the Board, Union Miniere du Haut Katanga. The mineral belongs to the pyrite group, in which all minerals share the same building principle. The metal in the oxidation state +2 forms a sodium chloride structure together with the anion S22−. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S-S bonds. It occurs with pyrite, chalcopyrite and members of the linnaeite – polydymite group in ore deposits in carbonate rocks. In addition to the type locality in the Katanga district it is reported from Gansberg, Black Forest, Germany; near Filipstad, Varmland, Sweden; Bald Knob, near Sparta, Alleghany County, North Carolina and in the Fletcher mine of Reynolds County, Missouri.

Turkey recognized Kazakhstan on 16 December 1991, being the first state to recognize the independence of Kazakhstan, when Kazakhstan declared its independence. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on 2 March 1992. These relations have developed positively on the international stage as well as in commerce and strategic affairs. Kazakhstan has an embassy in Ankara and a consulate general in Istanbul. Turkey has an embassy in Almaty and a branch office in Nur-Sultan. History Turkey established diplomatic relations with Kazakhstan following the latter's independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As two large nations in Eurasia and sharing the extensive cultural, historical and linguistic heritage of Turkic peoples, both nations have sought to develop closer relations and promote Turkic identity and friendship amongst other Turkic nations in the region. Diplomatic relations Atatürk in Nur-Sultan Turkey is the first country to recognise Kazakhstan's independence in 1991, but the relations between two nations have deep roots of being used to be the parts of a big family and sharing the same territory until the 11th century, when the ancestors of today's Turks living in Turkey moved to Middle East and created “second Turan” – The Ottoman Empire. The first official diplomatic relations started between Kazakh Khan and Ottoman Sultan in 1713. However, being separated by historical circumstances, due to which the connection with each other had been lost. Since the late 20th century, the peoples of Kazakhstan and Turkey have gained the opportunity to restore the broken relationship, to establish multilateral contacts at all levels, in all areas of cooperation. Though, the first steps of the relations in modern stage started prior to the breakdown of the Soviet Union. In March 1991, Turkey and Kazakhstan signed an Agreement on Cooperation in political, trade-economic, scientific-technical, ecological, cultural, social, communication and in other areas. In September 1991, the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkey signed the Declaration containing the principles and objectives of bilateral relations. In this context, the principles of friendly relations were emphasised based on the objectives of international documents.Davut Han Aslan (2012),Turkey’s Foreign Policy of the Justice and Development Party Governments (2002-2011) ,PhD Dissertation, Warsaw University, Warsaw, June> The incumbent President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev during his visit to Turkey in the same year defined the 21st century as the “Turks’ century” On 2 March 1992, the diplomatic relations were established and in the same year – the embassies of both countries were opened in Kazakhstan and Turkey.

The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1973 in Belgium and production continued in 1974 in Japan by Miroku.Browning Serial Numbers It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956. Remington manufactured a lighter weight version under license from 1919-1935 as the Remington Model 24 and then replaced it with the Remington Model 241 in 1935. Except for the barrel locking mechanism the Remington Model 241 is very similar to the Browning SA-22. A close copy of the SA-22 was made by the Chinese company Norinco and imported into the US by Interarms as the Model ATD. The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic rifle chambered in .22 LR caliber,Shideler, Dan. Gun Digest 64. Krause Publications, 2010. and is regarded as a classic firearm.House, James E.

This feature was intended by the designer to keep the user's face \\"protected from gasses and flying particles while firing\\", at which it succeeds especially for smaller people. Downward-ejected hot spent cases can become trapped in a shirt sleeve, so care should be taken to avoid this with proper hand placement on the forend. The rifle was intended for a wide age range, and period advertisements recommend the rifle both for adult usage as well as appropriate for youth shooters. The lack of a side-mounted ejection port also leaves a large \\"canvas\\" for engraving. Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal, and is done by laser engraving with hand finishing at Miroku. It has occasionally been sold with a factory fitted hard case, or with scope mounting grooves on the receiver. Initial production models had a small loading port located on the top of the stock in contrast to later models which had the loading port located on the right side of the buttstock. Over half a million SA-22 rifles have been sold since 1914.

He was the son of a founding father of the United States, Gouverneur Morris (1752–1816) and his wife, Ann Cary Randolph (1774–1837), nicknamed \\"Nancy\\". Career Morris was one of the major entrepreneurs of the 19th century Bronx. As Vice President of the New York and Harlem River Railroad, he built the railroad now running along Park Avenue in New York City. In 1840, he donated St. Ann's Church as a family memorial. He promoted Port Morris as a commercial port, and donated land to skilled workers in 1848, to create an ideal workingman’s village if it were called Morrisania. That is today’s Morrisania neighborhood. He spent much of the later part of his career in Vermont, as president of the Vermont Valley Railroad. He wasn't as active in politics as his famous father, but he was a founder of the Republican Party and attended its opening convention in 1854. Personal life He married his first cousin Martha Jefferson Cary, daughter of writer Virginia Randolph Cary (1786–1852).Louise Pecquet du Bellet, Some Prominent Virginia Families, p. 81,2 Together they had three children.

Terence Fox served as the first Shell Professor. Initially the Shell Professors also chaired the chemical engineering department, but in 1998 these two roles were separated, with the department chair becoming a fixed-term position that could also be held by other professors.

The donation of £435,000 was, at the time, the second-largest gift the university had been given. At the time of the donation, representatives for Shell argued that the Shell Professors should be paid considerably more than other Cambridge professors, because of the need to compete with industry salaries, but this did not happen.

Elite Systems released a different game with the same title for the ZX Spectrum computer on February 23, 1985. Both versions are based on the television series of the same name. Atari had previously made two separate attempts to release an Atari 2600 video game based on the series, but both versions failed to materialize. Gameplay In the Coleco version, the player controls the General Lee and must drive through Hazzard County. The game's premise concerns Daisy Duke, who has been abducted by Jeremiah Stinge. The player's goal is to catch Stinge, by passing his blue car, while avoiding Boss Hogg. The game ends if the player is stopped by Boss Hogg or if the player wrecks the General Lee. The game requires that the player drive at a perfect speed; driving too slow results in the player being caught by Hogg, while driving too fast can result in a vehicle collision with oncoming traffic. A rear-view mirror provides the player with a way to look out for Hogg. The player must also avoid obstacles such as oil slicks and damaged bridges. The game makes use of the ColecoVision's Expansion Module #2 steering wheel/pedal peripheral, and additionally requires that the player shift gears. The ZX Spectrum version uses a different premise: Boss Hogg threatens to seize the General Lee as collateral unless Bo Duke and Luke Duke can provide $5,000 owed to him. Bo and Luke enter the Annual Hazzard County Cross Country Road Race, hoping to win the first-place prize of $5,000, but Hogg and the Hazzard County police attempt to halt their efforts. The game is played as a continuously scrolling roadway, with the General Lee travelling from left to right. Controlling the General Lee, the player can change lanes and speed. Enemy vehicles can be avoided or destroyed by the player using dynamite sticks. However, Daisy and her Jeep must not be destroyed. Other enemies include helicopters. Development The Coleco version was announced in January 1984, at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Dukes of Hazzard was one of only five games to utilize the ColecoVision's Expansion Module #2. Lawrence Schick worked as a designer on the Coleco version. Paul Jaquays also worked as a designer on the Coleco version; Jaquays referred to it as one of the games that \\"didn't do what we had hoped,\\" saying it was \\"a license we were stuck with and did what we could with it.\\" The ZX Spectrum version was developed to feature nearly 100 different animated frames of the General Lee. Reception Jeff Silva of Expandable Computer News, who rated the Coleco version 7 out of 10, praised the sound and graphics, and wrote that the game, \\"in its simplicity, captures perfectly the one-dimensional themes of the original TV show. It is difficult at first because shifting is much like shifting a manual transmission, so it takes a while to get the hang of it. The rear view mirror on the screen is a great addition.\\" Silva concluded that the game was a \\"fun, though simple-minded chase through Hazzard County.\\" Phil Wiswell and Bernie Dekoven of Enter magazine wrote a positive review of the Coleco version: \\"Believe it or not, this game is good. [...] We were worried that this game would only appeal to Dukes of Hazzard fans, and not be much fun to play. But, in fact, we think you'll like this game whether or not you care for the Duke boys and their TV show. It's a tough driving game that challenges you from start to finish.\\" Wiswell and Dekoven called the game's rear-view mirror \\"a neat idea, though you don't get to use it enough.\\" Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame wrote that the Coleco version \\"is not quite on par with more traditional racers from the era such as Turbo, Pole Position or even Pitstop.\\" Crash magazine rated the ZX Spectrum version 63 percent and praised the graphics but criticized the gameplay. Crash later wrote that \\"there isn't much, except the General Lee graphics, to connect the game with the TV series.\\" Your Computer rated the ZX Spectrum version three stars and wrote, \\"The screen display is excellent and the game is rather more playable than some of Elite's previous offerings.\\" Computer and Video Games said that Dukes of Hazzard fans would enjoy the ZX Spectrum version, writing that while it \\"isn't as spectacular as one of those amazing stunts you see the General Lee perform on TV, it ain't bad either. [...] The graphics are nice and the scrolling pretty smooth.\\" The magazine wrote that the game can become addicting upon getting used to the controls. Home Computing Weekly, which gave the ZX Spectrum version two stars out of five, called the game \\"boring\\", in part because of the inability to change its difficulty settings. The publication noted \\"the limited graphics are very well-drawn, the sound is simple but effective and machine code ensures a smooth movement of vehicles and scrolling.\\" Three critics for Your Sinclair gave the ZX Spectrum version a negative review, criticizing the controls and poor collision detection, although one reviewer felt that the game had the potential to become a commercial success. Cancelled Atari 2600 versions Initially, Atari, Inc. attempted to revamp the graphics of an unreleased Atari 2600 port of their arcade game Stunt Cycle, to convert it into a Dukes of Hazzard game. For unknown reasons, Atari abandoned the idea. In November 1982, Atari Age reported about a new video game in development at Atari that would be based on a popular CBS television series, later revealed to be The Dukes of Hazzard, for the Atari 2600. Mark R. Hahn, the game's sole programmer, had a development team stationed in New York, while the majority of Atari's staff was based in California. Hahn claimed that the California team did not provide much assistance to his team, saying, \\"There was a lot of competition between the New York and California offices. Nobody from marketing (which was in California) was willing to tell me they didn't like the game. So I did demos of several screens, they said they liked them, and then I got working on game play.\\" Hahn said the game was still in development in 1983, when Atari, for unknown reasons, chose to have the unfinished game burned onto a large number of ROM chips. Atari abruptly cancelled the game before the chips were to be placed into cartridges and shipped. The game was nearly completed. Atari was not satisfied with the game's graphics, which were lacking in comparison to other games the company was releasing at the time. Hahn only learned of the game's cancellation from the secretary of an Atari VIP, and said, \\"I had put months of very long days and weekends into the game. I was a bit upset.\\" Atari Age reported the game's cancellation in September 1983. The game would have had the player control the General Lee, with the goal being to break Daisy out of jail before Boss Hogg can get to her, while also avoiding Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and Deputy Enos Strate in their police vehicles. The game contained many glitches and gameplay issues. One of the game's major glitches included Rosco and Enos abruptly ramming the General Lee if it got too close to their vehicles, resulting in the player losing a life.

It was designed in 1928 for Sumner Welles (1892-1961) by the Washington architect, Jules Henri de Sibour (1872-1938). It was built in 1929, and consists of a two-story main block of Flemish bond brick and a northern wing. Also on the property are two outbuildings contemporary with the house; a five-car garage and attached manager's quarters and greenhouse, and a stable. There are also formal gardens on the grounds. History The Oxon Hill Manor property has a strong historical association. The colonial-era Addison family, active in the development of Prince George's county and in the colonial government, built a mansion on the property in 1711. In 1778, Thomas Hawkins Hanson, nephew of John Hanson, acquired the property. John Hanson died at Oxon Hill Manor on November 22, 1783, and was buried on the property. Walter Dulaney Addison who was for a time Chaplain of the Senate lived here and conducted a school here.. His son Lloyd Dulany Addison would migrate to Kentucky then to Mobile, Alabama, becoming socially involved in the city. He then moved onto New Orleans, Louisiana, becoming a partner at Bullitt, Miller & Co., and founding the Mistick Krewe of Comus and The Pickwick Club. After a period of ownership by the Berry family, in 1895, the original Oxon Hill Manor burned. In 1927, the property was bought by Sumner Welles, U.S. Undersecretary of State, who built the present manor house. Franklin D. Roosevelt and possibly Sir Winston Churchill were guests there. It was later the home of Fred Maloof, a wealthy oilman, timberland owner, and art collector who established a museum for fine art and John Hanson memorabilia, before the property came under the control of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

In 1867, Canada became a confederated state and that same year, Hungary joined Austria and created the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Initially, all official contact between Canada and the empire was conducted via-London. In August 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Germany. Canada joined British forces and fought together during World War I.Veterans Affairs Canada: The Conflict Begins At the end of the war in 1918, Hungary became an independent nation. During World War II, Canadian and Hungarian troops fought against each other during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. At the end of the war, Hungary became a communist state.

The vans are operated by contractors working for the BBC, to enforce the television licensing system in the UK, the Channel Islands and on the Isle of Man. History When television broadcasts in the UK were resumed after a break because of the Second World War, it was decided to introduce a television licence fee to finance the service. When first introduced on 1 June 1946, the licence covering the monochrome-only single- channel BBC television service cost £2 (equivalent to £ as of ). The licence was originally issued by the General Post Office (GPO), which was then the regulator of public communications within the UK. Since it was not possible to stop people without a licence from buying and operating a TV, it was necessary to find ways of enforcing the TV licence system. One of the methods used to identify TV use without a licence was TV detection equipment mounted in a van. The first TV detector van was demonstrated on 1 February 1952. In the 1950s, the Post Office, which then administered the TV licensing system, ran converted Hillman Minx and Morris Oxford estate cars, which had large aerials attached to their roofs. Subsequently, Commers were introduced. In the 1980s, vans were supplied by Dodge and Leyland. In the 1990s, Ford Transits were introduced. In 2003, TVL launched its 10th model of detector vans. It was stated that these vans had removable branding so that they could operate covertly. Although the operating principles of the TV detectors used in these vans were not revealed by the BBC, it was thought that they operated by detecting electromagnetic radiation given off by a TV. The most common suggested method was the detection of a signal from the TV's local oscillator. In 2013, the Radio Times obtained a leaked internal document from the BBC giving a breakdown of prosecutions for TV licence evasion. The 18-page document gave a breakdown of the number of people evading the charge, as well as mentioning the number of people employed to catch those who do not pay their television licence. However, no mention was made of TV detector vans being used to catch such people, prompting media speculation over the truth of their existence. In response a BBC spokeswoman rejected claims that the vans are a hoax: \\"Detector vans are an important part of our enforcement of the licence fee. We don't go into detail about how many there are or how they work as this information might be useful to people trying to evade the fee.\\"  Detection techniques  Around ten generations of detector van technology were used. The first three were described in The Post Office Electrical Engineers' Journal. = Line-scan = The first detector was introduced in 1952. It operated by detecting the magnetic field, rather than any radio signal, of the horizontal line-scanning deflection within the cathode ray tube. Television tubes, unlike oscilloscopes, used magnetic deflection. The deflection current was a sawtooth with a frequency of 10.125 kHz. As this was the horizontal deflection, the magnetic field lines were almost vertical. Three small horizontal loop antennae were thus used to detect it, mounted on the roof of the detector van. These were arranged in an L shape, manually switched in two pairs of either diagonally front-back and side-side. The coils, and their receiver, were tuned to a fixed frequency of 20.25 kHz, the second harmonic of the line-scan signal, with a bandwidth of 200 Hz. The line-scan frequency was generated within the TV as a multiple of the mains frequency and could vary slightly long-term. This bandwidth was chosen to allow reception of a varying frequency, yet also to exclude as much ignition noise from the van's engine as possible. This ignition interference was the source of the main limitation on the detector's performance. The second harmonic frequency was chosen as it allowed the use of commercially available radio receivers, whilst avoiding both excessive ignition interference at the fundamental frequency, or confusing long wave radio carriers with the higher harmonics. The received signal was mixed with a local beat frequency oscillator (BFO) to produce an audible 1 kHz beat frequency, just as is done for CW Morse radio reception. The operator detected signals by listening on headphones and a meter gave an indication of signal strength. To operate the detector, it was driven along the road past target houses. As an operating TV was approached, the signal increased. The operator could switch between pairs of the antennae, giving a peak sensitivity either ahead of the van, or to the side. When the two combinations were of equal strength, the van was alongside the house. A similar comparison could tell if the TV was to the left or right of the street. As the TV tube was being detected directly, the location of the TV aerial made no difference. = VHF = By 1963 the second British TV network, ITV, had begun transmission. This made the original system of TV detection increasingly unworkable. The two networks did not have their line-scan signals accurately synchronised. If two nearby TVs were each tuned to different channels, they then created a beat frequency effect which could swamp the TV detector. The original magnetic low-frequency detector system was also suffering because TV design had improved to radiate less of a magnetic field, and also the increasing number of cars made interference from their ignition circuits greater. A new detection system was required and this would rely on detecting leakage signals from the local oscillator used in superheterodyne radio receiver circuits. Transmissions at this time were on the 405-line system and used the Band I (47 to 68 MHz), Band II (87.5 to 108.0, VHF / FM sound-only radio) and Band III (174 to 240 MHz) VHF bands. Because of the broadness of the TV transmission bands, and variations in the intermediate frequencies used, a detector receiver could have needed to be tunable between 29 and 240 MHz. By detecting either the fundamentals of Band III, or the harmonics of Bands I and II, the detector system managed to make do with only 110–250 MHz. The antenna on the detector car was a rotatable, highly directional antenna. It was used by taking bearings on the TV set from multiple locations and triangulating them. Its detection range was several hundred yards, although usually only a few houses distance on a built-up street. As the polarisation of the leaked signal was unpredictable, the detector aerial had to be able to receive mixed or elliptical polarisation. This was achieved with a dipole antenna which was tilted diagonally, placed in front of a metal mesh corner reflector, the whole assembly of which could be rotated. The beam width was narrow enough to give an accuracy of around 5° in locating a source. The complete antenna was large, and permanently mounted on top of a Morris Oxford Traveller estate car, rather than the previous van, so that the overall height of was no more than a typical large van, avoiding height clearance problems. It was mounted on a 2\\" diameter aluminium tube mast, rotated manually by a handwheel. The receiver and display were built into a single box, mounted where the front passenger seat had been. The operator and a Postal And Telegraph Operator, who also acted as a map reader and who had a list of valid and recently-expired licences, sat on the rear passenger seat. An unusual feature of the vehicle was an optical periscope, slaved to the rotation of the mast, which identified the house from which the signals were detected. At night, this could be used to project a spot of light instead. To avoid the operator needing to move their head with the periscope, a pair of prisms were used to produce the rotation, with a fixed eyepiece. The receiver electronics produced a frequency analyser panoramic display on a 5\\" CRT screen. This display was swept automatically across a range up to 8 MHz. The initial input stage was based on an existing TV 'turret tuner' design, with manual selection across 14 bands spanning 110–250 MHz. As the number of broadcast channels in use locally was very small, only a couple of the mechanically-switched bands would be needed for each detection search. The receiver circuit was a triple superheterodyne, with the second IF frequency being swept between 60 and 70 MHz, in synchronism with the CRT horizontal scan. The IF oscillator was controlled by the sweep signal through a form of transductor circuit, where a control winding controlled the reluctance of the inductor controlling the oscillator frequency. This sweep range was controllable by the operator and could be reduced to zero, making the receiver a simple receiver with an output to headphones. = UHF = Dodge SpaceVan equipped as UHF detector van. Displayed at Science Museum, London. () The introduction of UHF 625-line TV to the UK, and the possibility of colour TV, used Bands IV and V and required a new generation of detector vans. A new, more expensive, colour licence was also introduced and an increase in licence evasion was anticipated, as licences were not upgraded for new colour sets. Once again, by detecting only the upper range of the frequency band, the upper fundamentals and the harmonics of the lower bands could both be detected with the same equipment, without requiring an impractically broad frequency range for the detector receiver. Two new problems needed to be addressed for detection of the new sets: firstly the emissions were both higher in frequency and lower in signal strength than before. Secondly, the propagation of signals at this wavelength and their tendency for confusing reflections from many nearby surfaces meant that the previous triangulation method from a couple of positions was no longer reliable. A method was needed which could replace triangulation by a more immediate form of location. A suitable broadband aerial for the frequency range of 470–860 MHz was a log-periodic spiral, wound on a six-foot long conical former. This had a directionality of 40° for a beam width at half maximum power. To give a narrower directionality, two of these aerials were mounted together in parallel, and spaced apart by 6λ, or six wavelengths at the detected frequency. The aerials pointed sideways in operation, and could be turned lengthwise for driving to the search site. As the necessary spacing varied with frequency, the forward aerial moved backwards and forwards automatically, with tuning. At low frequencies, the large spacing needed required an extension of the van's roof forwards in a prominent box. Waterproofing was provided by a greased neoprene flap, closed by a zipper when not in use. A common misunderstanding was that the aerials moved in a scanning pattern when searching, as the VHF detectors had, but in fact they remained static. The receiver beam pattern of the two aerial system was still approximately 40° across, but this was now divided into seven sharply defined lobes, with a central lobe only about 4° across. The motion of the vehicle driving slowly was used as the scanning mechanism and a rotation sensor on the speedometer drive provided the X-axis scanning signal for the display. A manual pushbutton was pressed as each house boundary was passed. The ideal detection display was thus a series of seven peaks, centred on the position between the two house markers for the target house. Two CRTs were used for display, one by the operator and the other for providing a photographic record. A Polaroid 'instant' camera was used, so that the print could be produced at the time, before confronting the homeowner. The initial search for the presence of a TV, rather than accurately locating its position, was done with a separate aerial pair. These were a simple pair of dipoles, one on either side of a shared reflector plate, and comparing signal strength from each side. Later detector vans, such as the Leyland illustrated, used a development of that technique with paired aerials, making a mechanically much simpler aerial system. The completed system was the most visually well- recognised of all the TV detector vans, particularly as their success and the expanded enforcement campaign with the growth of colour TV made them the most numerous. The system was mounted in a Commer PB van, as was becoming the standard GPO Telephones van, although extensively modified to carry the aerials. They also had an automatic gearbox, to ease the task of driving slowly down urban streets. = Flat-screen TVs = A 2013 study was conducted on television emissions detection by Markus G. Kuhn. This found that emissions from modern sets were still detectable, but that it was increasingly difficult to relate these to the received signal, and thus to correlate a set's emissions with a particular licensed broadcast. The sets radiated from a number of sources, particularly the display controller and its low-voltage differential signaling link to the LCD panel. Modern sets follow a consistent internal structure of a separate front-end video processor and a display controller, each highly integrated to a single IC. They are supplied by some form of analogue tuner, according to local broadcast standards. The video processor converts an analogue signal to a consistent digital signal standard, such as ITU-656. The display controller then maps this signal to the particular screen panel fitted, its pixel dimensions, such as the 1440×900 WXGA+ standard, which is entirely separate from the broadcast size standards, such as 576×720. The display controller also maps aspect ratios such as 4:3 and 16:9. Difficulty in identifying emanations from a set is for a number of reasons. Firstly the emissions are simply lower, owing to modern standards for EMI and the increasingly enforced compliance with EMC standards. Signals within the video processor IC would be an obvious target for recognition, in a similar manner to older detectors, but these are far too low to be measurable outside. Secondly the available signals are now divorced from the broadcast signal. The LVDS link to the LCD panel provides receivable signals, but these are dependent on the configuration of the panel as much as on the broadcast being received, and are hard to reconstruct so as to be recognisable. In the crudest manners, a discernible video signal can be recognised, but this would be hard to tie to a specific broadcast, or to an evidentiary standard. A simple optical detector may be able to achieve just as much, and from a simpler circuit. There is some suggestion that this method is now in use. Operation The BBC carries out its TV licensing activities under the trade name \\"TV Licensing\\", although most of the activities are performed by its contractors. Detector vans are operated by Capita Business Services Ltd, a contractor of the BBC. Some information regarding TV detection technology was revealed as part of a freedom of information request made to the BBC in 2013, which included details of a search warrant. The warrant revealed that a BBC contractor had used an \\"optical detector\\" to reveal the possible presence of a TV. The warrant stated that: \\"the optical detector in the detector van uses a large lens to collect that light and focus it on to an especially sensitive device, which converts fluctuating light signals into electrical signals, which can be electronically analysed. If a receiver is being used to watch broadcast programmes then a positive reading is returned.\\" The BBC stated that this was strong evidence that a set was \\"receiving a possible broadcast\\". According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office, \\"where the BBC still suspects that an occupier is watching live television but not paying for a licence, it can send a detection van to check whether this is the case. TVL detection vans can identify viewing on a non-TV device in the same way that they can detect viewing on a television set. BBC staff were able to demonstrate this to my staff in controlled conditions sufficient for us to be confident that they could detect viewing on a range of non-TV devices.\\" In July 2019, an article in the Oxford Mail recalled a two-week period from June 1960 when an olive-green TV detector van—one of a fleet of nine owned by the BBC—toured the city to investigate 500 addresses with no record of a television licence. The van contained a team of three people, \\"including a radio expert and a local Post Office official\\" and was equipped with a number of aerials that could be adjusted to pinpoint a signal being given off by a television at a specific address. The article quoted Ron Smith, who was in charge of the operation, and explained the process: \\"When a TV set is switched on it gives out a radio signal. The detector van then used its adapted radio receiver which is tuned to the wavelength of the signal and then converts it to a whistle transmitted through the technical officer's headphones.\\" The team were authorised to ask residents to produce their TV licence and to note down their details if they couldn't. Regulation of use TV detection is a form of covert surveillance and as such is regulated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). More specifically, the BBC's use of surveillance is defined by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. Like other public bodies that undertake covert surveillance, the BBC is subject to the scrutiny of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners, which inspects the BBC every other year. A number of official inspection reports on the BBC's detection methods have been made available following freedom-of-information requests. These reports give an outline of the process of authorisation of the use of detection equipment. Briefly, applications for authorisation are made in the name of the Detection Manager. Correspondence between TV Licensing and the affected householder may be attached to the completed application forms, which pass through a quality- control \\"gatekeeper\\" to the authorising officers (AOs) at the BBC. In 2012 there were two designated AOs at the BBC. To be authorised, an application must be shown to be \\"necessary and proportionate\\". AOs sometimes reject applications. Once approved, the authorisation lasts for a duration of 8 weeks. In popular culture * The \\"Fish Licence\\" sketch on Monty Python's Flying Circus, aired in 1970, mentions a \\"cat detector van\\", a parody of the TV detector van. * In The Young Ones episode 4 \\"Bomb\\" the boys are visited by a TV detector van worker, who questions Neil as to whether they have a TV.

He appeared in 136 films between 1937 and 1965. Biography Hans Albert Nielsen was born in Hamburg, Germany. He first got an education in business, but afterward, began taking private acting lessons from Albrecht Schoenhals and Erich Ziegel. He made his stage debut in Hamburg in 1932, after which he worked in Augsburg, Kiel, Leipzig, Berlin, Munich and Düsseldorf. Many actors and performing artists fled Nazi Germany, but Nielsen remained. He made his film debut in 1937 in Daphne and the Diplomat, followed by German movies, such as Heimat (with Zarah Leander), Friedrich Schiller – The Triumph of a Genius (with Horst Caspar) and The Great King (with Otto Gebühr). After World War II, Nielsen performed in a Kabarett group, Die Außenseiter (\\"The Outsider\\") and played in revues by cabaret artist Günter Neumann. He resumed his successful film acting career in 1947, appearing in In Those Days, a drama by Helmut Käutner. He often played roles that were good-natured, likeable and elegant, such as the presiding judge in the 1953 satire Hocuspocus with Curt Goetz; the criminal defense attorney in Confess, Doctor Corda; a police inspector with Christopher Lee in Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace; the police chief in Scotland Yard Hunts Dr. Mabuse and a judge in The Juvenile Judge, with Heinz Rühmann. He also worked with Curd Jürgens and Lilo Pulver in a film version of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer's Gustav Adolf's Page. He also appeared in a few Karl May films and in Edgar Wallace's The Indian Scarf, Das Phantom von Soho and The Door with Seven Locks.

Introduction  The tournament is held twice a year, once during the Pentecost weekend and once in autumn. The event always starts on a Friday evening and ends on the following Monday morning. Although each ETDS is organised by a different party, the structure remains fairly constant: on Friday evening, the blind date program takes place, in which dancers without a partner can try to find someone with which to compete in one or both dance disciplines. Blind dating is also a motivation for some dancers that want to meet new people. On Saturday, the ballroom tournament for the breitensport class (German, meaning amateur sports for the masses) takes place and the Latin-American tournament for the open class as well as, if so chosen by the organising party, for the CloseD class. On Sunday, all classes dance the respective other discipline. The event ends on Monday with a last common breakfast. The organisation of each tournament is in the hands of a different participating university. The tournament takes place in the city of the organising university, the location changing every half year to another European city. So far, the tournament has taken place most of the times either in Germany or the Netherlands. In autumn 2015, the ETDS took place in Czech Republic, breaking that series for the first time. With the participation of some students from South Africa, it also premiered hosting dancers from outside Europe. Although the primary focus of the ETDS lies in organising a tournament of high standards, the event equally aims at creating a social happening where dancers from all of Europe can meet each other. This is encouraged by the possibility to blind date and by a themed festival (\\"motto party\\") on the event's Saturday evening and a gala ball on Sunday evening. The sleeping accommodation is commonly a local gym.  History  The ETDS was founded by the university dance teams of Clausthal, Braunschweig and Kiel, who agreed to get to know each other during a tournament. The event was organised by these three German universities for a number of times. There was not a regular structure, but the tournament was organised ad hoc. Finding a sleeping accommodation was easy, as the number of participants was still very low. In November 1990, a tournament prize was introduced that has been used ever since, “der tanzmaus” (German for “the dance mouse”), a pluche mouse. The tanzmaus was a donation of the university of Kiel; Clausthal was the first university to win the mouse. It is given to the winning university which \\"hosts\\" the price until the next ETDS. In December 1991, a tournament during Sinterklaas took place. The tournament gained more participants and Berlin started participating as well. Berlin won the dance mouse during this Sinterklaas tournament, and promised to organise the event somewhere in the future. During this tournament, only one class existed. In April 1992, the tournament took place in Clausthal. This was the first tournament in which the team of Dortmund started participating. Some tournaments later, Ulm and Marburg started participating as well. The University of Berlin fulfilled their promise in 1993 by taking care of the organisation of the tournament. The tournament still did not have separate classes. The next tournament took place in the spring of 1994, and the tournament gained in popularity; fifteen universities from Germany participated. Also, for the first time, universities from the Netherlands started to participate. The new universities were from Mainz, Geisenheim, Kaiserslautern, Delft and Eindhoven. During autumn of 1994, the number of participants had increased to such a high amount that problems started to arise between the organisation and the administration of Kiel. The result was that Kiel was disallowed to organise the event for five years. The next tournament took place in the spring of 1995, and for the first time, the tournament was separated into two classes. They were called “amateurs” and “profis” (\\"professionals\\"). Leipzig also joined this tournament. The tournament that was held in the summer of 1995 was the first event to take place in the Netherlands. The organisation was in the hands of ESDV Footloose from Eindhoven. Groningen joined during this tournament. From now on, the ETDS was no longer organised on an ad hoc basis, but was organised regularly twice each year, during Pentecost and in the autumn, each time by a different university. The number of participants continued to grow, and around 2004 a third class, \\"masters\\", was added to the breitensport section. More than 500 participants took part in the 41st tournament in Groningen in May 2009, and another breitensport class by the name of “champions” was introduced. The event continued to grow in popularity, and 570 participants were competing in the 47th edition during Pentecost, May 2012. In October 2015, the event was held for the first time in the Czech Republic, in the city of Brno. This was the first ETDS not organised in Germany or the Netherlands.  Rules  Every ETDS organisation is allowed to make their own rules for the tournament. Each organisation describes rules about clothing and the calculation of the tanzmaus evaluation. Because the focus of each organization may be different, the balance between social orientation and competition changes slightly. Nevertheless, several rules exist during each tournament: = Structure = Dancers can sign up for two disciplines, standard and Latin-American. In the breitensport class, only untrained and low level training dancers are allowed. Professional dancers, i.e. those who have reached a higher class in official tournaments held by dance associations, are excluded from the breitensport tournaments. They instead dance in the open class which ranges at least from B to S class dancers. Some hosting universities decide to provide another separate tournament for a class called CloseD, which consists of dancers of the official D and C classes (varying between national dance associations). In case a separate tournament for this class is chosen not to be held, the organising team will classify the concerning dancers into either breitensport (D class) or open class (C class). Participants that belong to a dance formation may also be required to dance in the CloseD or open class, depending on the league in which their formation is classified. In the breitensport section, a pre-qualification round takes place, where each participating couple is classified into the amateur, professional (\\"profi\\"), master or the optional champion class, so that each couple will dance the subsequent actual tournament in a class that matches their levels. These tournaments follow the rules of official dancing tournaments. During the finals, open adjudication is sometimes performed, with each adjudicator showing their ranking of the couples on the floor immediately after each dance. However, closed adjudication is often chosen in order to save time. There are winner's certificates and medals for all participants in the finals as well as trophies (instead of medals) for the podium finishers. = Dances= In the respective disciplines, the following dances have to be performed (example rule set): * Breitensport: ballroom preliminary round: slow waltz, tango, quickstep, from the semi-final of masters and champions additionally: Viennese waltz and/or slowfox; latin preliminary round: cha-cha-cha, rumba, jive, from the semi- final of masters and champions additionally: samba, paso doble * CloseD: similar to breitensport, but with a re-dance round for those who didn't directly qualify for the next round * Open class: similar to CloseD The ETDS has also seen separate competitions without class separation in Discofox, Salsa and Polka. = Adjudication = The adjudicators are chosen from volunteers of the participating universities that do not compete themselves in the discipline in which they judge. Adjudicators are selected by their adjudicator's license, by their experience and/or by their level of dancing in regular dance competitions. = Blind dating = A blind date couple consists of two dancers from different universities. Blind dating is mandatory in the CloseD and open classes (in the latter case sometimes being replaced by composing couples by the lot or by other rules), and stimulated in the breitensport by a blind date programme on Friday and Saturday for the following day's tournament. During the breitensport tournaments, a blind date couple can score more points for a university, and thereby improve their team's chance of winning the tanzmaus prize. = Participants = Every member of a student dancing society or university student can participate. Each couple dances under the flag of his or her university or dance society. Staff members of the university or dancing society are also allowed to participate. When universities have too few participants to compete for the tanzmaus, they can team up with other universities to improve their chances.  Nationalities  Every European university or student dance society can participate. In practice, a majority of the participants is German. The second largest participating party is from the Netherlands, and some dancers from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Estonia, Norway and other neighbouring countries participate as well. The record for the most teams participating in an ETDS was set at 54th ETDS Brno, where 37 teams from 11 countries took part. This was the first participation for the teams from Crimea/Ukraine, Lublin/Poland, Winterthur/Switzerland and Cape Town/South Africa. = Germany = From Germany, universities from the following cities have been participating in the ETDS: * Aachen * Berlin * Bielefeld * Bonn * Braunschweig * Clausthal * Cottbus * Darmstadt * Dortmund * Düsseldorf * Erlangen * Frankfurt * Geisenheim * Gießen * Göttingen * Hannover * Hildesheim * Kaiserslautern * Karlsruhe * Kehl * Kiel * Leipzig * Mainz * Marburg * München * Münster * Stuttgart * Ulm = The Netherlands = In the Netherlands, the participants often dance under the flag of a dancing society, unlike in Germany, where participants dance under the flag of their university. From the Netherlands, the following cities have been participating in the ETDS: * Amsterdam (dancing society S.D.V. AmsterDance) * Delft (dancing society D.S.D.A.

Since 1539 the city council tacitly tolerated and gradually openly promoted Lutheranism, so that St. Nicholas Church had become a Lutheran church by 1573. Following King Sigismund III's Prussian regency contract (1605) with Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg and his Prussian enfeoffment contract (Treaty of Warsaw, 1611) with John Sigismund of Brandenburg these two rulers of Ducal Prussia guaranteed free practice of Catholic religion in prevailingly Lutheran Prussia. Based on these contracts Prince-Bishop Szymon Rudnicki of Ermland/Warmia achieved the restitution of St. Nicholas as Roman Catholic parish church in 1612, then the only one in Elbing, and remaining a Catholic church since.http://www.portel.pl/artykul.php3?i=27937 St. Nicholas was damaged by fire in the late 18th century, then destroyed in World War II and reconstructed.

In Buddhism In Buddhism Abhaswaras or Abhasvaras is the name of a heaven. The words roots are Sanskrit (from \\"a\\" near to, towards + the verbal root \\"bhas\\" to shine upon, illuminate). In Hinduism In Hinduism, Abhaswaras is a class of deities. They are sixty-four in number and their nature is not well known. They are described as \\"demigods representing a certain cycle of manifestation and the active phase of the evolutionary process set in motion by an act of will of Brahman, who remains transcendent while emanating forth the world\\". These inferior deities are attendant upon Shiva, and under the command of Ganesa. They dwell on Gana- parvata, i.e., Kailasa. While Dawson in his Hindu Encyclopaedia does not offer more information, it is known that they are one of the nine Gana deities: Adityas, Viswas or Viswe-devas, Vasus, Tushitas, Abhaswaras, Anilas, Maharajikas, Sadhyas, and Rudras.

Background  Social ventures may be structured in many forms, including sole proprietorships, For-profit corporations, nonprofit organizations, non- governmental organizations, youth groups, community organizations, and more. Typically, government organizations are not considered to be social ventures, yet even government organizations can adopt entrepreneurial practices, possibly partnering with independent organizations, to explore innovative methods for providing social services. Elkington and Hartigan define three models for social ventures: leveraged nonprofit, hybrid nonprofit, and social business.Elkington, John and Pamela Hartigan (2007). The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets that Change the World. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press. In the leveraged nonprofit venture the entrepreneur uses external partners for financial support in providing a public good. On the other hand, the hybrid nonprofit venture recovers a portion of its costs through sales of its goods or services. The social business venture generates profits, but rather than return those profits to shareholders, like commercial ventures, it reinvests those profits to further the social venture and the resulting social benefits. The distinguishing characteristic of the social venture versus the commercial venture is the primacy of their objective to solve social problems and provide social benefits. The social venture may generate profits, but that is not its focus. Rather profits are a possible means to achieve sustainability in providing a social benefit. The problems addressed by social ventures cover the range of social issues, including poverty, inequality, education, the environment, and economic development. The context in which social ventures operate is very complex as they are trying to bring about solutions where markets or governments may have failed or actually impede solutions. Further, these ventures are trying to provide solutions where money is usually in short supply—often these ventures have little assurance that their services can be paid for by those they seek to serve.Martin, Roger and Sally Osberg (2007). \\"Social Entrepreneurship: The Case for Definition.\\" Stanford Social Innovation Review, Spring:28-39. These conditions necessitate that the social entrepreneur be creative, adaptable, and determined in finding new solutions to problems.

History  The ship was built in 1987 under the name Astor by Howaldtswerke- Deutsche Werft (HDW), Kiel in West Germany for the Mauritius-based Marlan Corporation, although originally ordered by the South African Safmarine as a combined ocean liner/cruise ship for the Southampton-Cape Town service. In 1988, she was sold to the Soviet Union-based Black Sea Shipping Company and renamed Fedor Dostoevskiy (some sources spell the name Fedor Dostoyevskiy, ), but spent her time under charter to various West German cruise lines. In 1995, she reverted to the name, Astor. Since 1996, she has been under charter to Transocean Tours. On 28 November 2008, an attempted pirate attack on Astor in the Gulf of Oman was prevented by the German frigate Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. German frigate Mecklenburg-Vorpommern prevented a pirate attack on Astor in November 2008 Concept and construction The South African Safmarine had restarted ocean liner service between Southampton and Cape Town in 1984 by acquiring the 1981-built cruise ship Astor from the West German Hadag Cruise Line. In service the first Astors engines proved too underpowered to maintain liner service. As a result, Safmarine decided to order a new ship in 1985 from the HDW shipyard in Kiel, based on the same design as the 1981 Astor (which had been built at HDW's yard at Hamburg) but with additional facilities and more powerful engines, making her better suited for liner operations as well as cruising. Confusingly the new ship was also decided to be named Astor. Even though the second Astor was not to be delivered until 1987, the first Astor was sold to the East German Deutsche Seerederei (via a West German intermediary) in 1985. Soon after this Safmarine decided to abandon their passenger operations, and in January 1986 the second Astors construction contract was sold to the Mauritius-based Marlan Corporation. The ship was launched from dry dock on 30 May 1986 and delivered to the Marlan Corporation on 14 January 1987. Service history =1987–1988: Astor= Immediately following delivery on 14 January 1987, the Astor set on her maiden voyage from Hamburg to Genoa and from there further to South America. After this she was used for cruising on the Caribbean and to other destinations around the world. =1988–1995: Fedor Dostoevskiy= Fedor Dostoevskiy in c.1990 On 3 October 1988 Marlan Corporation sold the Astor to the Soviet Union-based Black Sea Shipping Company. Renamed Feodor Dostoevskiy and re-registered to the Soviet Union, the ship was chartered to the West German Transocean Tours in December 1988. She stayed in Transocean Tours service until March 1990, when she was chartered to Neckermann Seereisen. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Feodor Dostoevskiys ownership was transferred to Fedor Dostoevskiy Shipping Co., a Bahamas-based company, and reregistered to the Bahamas. Apart from the change of flag, this had no effect in her operations. =1995 onwards: Astor (again)= Following the end of Feodor Dostoevskiys charter to Neckermann Seereisen, she was chartered to Aquamarin in December 1995 and reverted to the name Astor. In 1996 the ship was sold to Astor Shipping Co., and again chartered to Transocean Tours. At some point prior to 2008 her owners changed to the Germany-based Premicon, but she continues under charter to Transocean. According to a company statement, Transocean Tours are planning to retain the Astor in their fleet at least until 2013. On 28 November 2008, the German Navy reportedly prevented Somalian pirate speedboats from attacking Astor. She was sailing in the Gulf of Oman en route from Sharm- al-Sheikh in Egypt to Dubai, when the German Mecklenburg-Vorpommern detected pirate speedboats apparently attempting to attack Astor. Mecklenburg- Vorpommern entered the path of the oncoming speedboats while they were still some three miles from Astor. Warning bursts of machine gun fire were used to ward off the threat without those on the cruise ship becoming aware of the situation. In February 2013, Astor was chartered for three years, commencing in 2013, by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) in a bid to fill the \\"gap\\" in the Australian market after the exit of Classic International Cruises. Astor is scheduled to embark on a visit from Europe, in addition to several around Australia and short cruises before arriving back in Europe in time for the European Summer. In December 2014, Cruise & Maritime Voyages purchased the vessel from its bankrupt owners, Premicon. The vessel planned to sail a winter 2015 season with Cruise & Maritime Voyages before briefly moving back to the fleet of Transocean Tours where she sailed a summer season from Germany before switching back to CMV for the winter 2016 season.  Design  = Exterior design = Astor departing from Fremantle Harbour, 2014 Externally, the 1987-built Astor was designed to be almost identical to the 1981-built Astor, but approximately longer. Due to the similar design the ships were distinguishable only due to the additional windows below the first lifeboat on the 1987 ship. Both Astors were designed with a sharply raked bow, a relatively low, terraced superstructure and a large, square funnel. In Marlan Corporation service, the Astor was initially painted with a white hull and superstructure, a red decorative stripe separating the hull and superstructure, and red/blue funnel with a large white cross painted on it alongside the letters ML. This was later altered so that the decorative stripe was extended to cover the entire lowest superstructure deck, while the funnel was painted white with red stripes. As Feodor Dostoevskiy, the decorative stripe on the hull reverted to the same form as in the original livery, while the funnel was painted white with blue exhaust pipes and a wide red stripe with the hammer and sickle emblem on it. In Transocean Tours service the ship received a livery with a narrower light/dark blue decorative stripe on the hull, a white funnel with blue exhaust pipes, a thin light/dark blue stripe with Transocean Tours' large T logo in the middle. =Interior design= As with the exterior, the interior layout and decorations of the 1987-built Astor were very similar to the 1981-built Astor, down to the bathroom fittings. However, the 1987-built ship was designed with a larger number of suites, improved crew quarters, an added casino and added conference facilities. Like the 1981-built ship, the 1987-built Astor was furnished in traditional style using large amounts of dark wood, with many of the public rooms having high ceilings. The author Douglas Ward described the ship as having \\"a certain degree of style, comfort and elegance\\". =Decks and facilities= As Astor in Transocean Tours service seven decks are accessible to passengers. Facilities include dining areas, Sauna, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a gym and a Showlounge.

It is a large, two-part brick house with Greek Revival detailing. The more recent, main block, was constructed in 1836, and was built by Zaddock Sasscer. Pleasant Hills was built in a side- hall-and-double-parlor plan style that was popular among the wealthy planter class of Prince George's County during the early part of the 19th century. The property was the homestead of the Sasscer and Hill family, prominent in local politics and commerce, since the property was purchased by Zaddock Sasscer as his \\"dwelling plantation\\" in 1807. The architectural details of the main block of the house suggest that it was constructed during the 1830s. In fact, the architrave around the windows and doorways are identical to one that appears in an Asher Benjamin builder's book of 1830. The two-story hyphen and wing, however, are earlier, and was standing when purchased by Zaddock Sasscer from Colmore Beans (brother to William Beanes of \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" fame) in 1807. According to the last family member owners, their restoration/renovation process revealed building methods and materials in the kitchen wing that pre- dates the rest of the main block. This is also supported by a family legend that the original main block burned to the ground. The side-hall and double- parlor plan in which Pleasant Hills was constructed is typical of homes built by the Prince George's County wealthy planter class. The double parlors allowed for a \\"best parlor\\" for receiving guests and a less formal back parlor (also known as dining parlor or sitting room) where the family could retire.(Garrett pgs. 46-47, 60-62) Double parlors could also allow for the partially separate, yet concurrent, entertaining of ladies and gentlemen. One parlor contained the typical accouterments of an early 19th-century parlor, including a dozen chairs, sofa, table, parlor mirror and three pictures. The second of the two parlors contained a parlor lamp, sideboard, two tables, book stand, liquor case, and a few odds and ends. As was typical of the family parlor, this room appears to have been used for dining and reading or other forms of relaxation. Still another room (probably the one adjoining the kitchen in the old section) lists a sideboard, cupboard, table, and chairs. The considerable amount of space given over to the hall passage further reflects the rise in the importance of separating social space from family space, and the control over circulation through rooms that occurred during the mid-18th century. The large hall served as both a formal entry into the house and a transitional space between the two parlors and the outside. It also allows for entry into either parlor without having to go through multiple rooms. The hall passage which runs from front to rear as seen at Pleasant Hills also allowed for cross ventilation, which was particularly important during summer months. Numerous inventories indicate that these passages were often used as living rooms during that time. It is not unusual to see listed dining or other tables, couches, desks, etc. within passages (or even bedsteads in second-floor passages). From these inventories the hall passage is speculated to be an integral part of the overall plan and probably served as more than just a formal entry. The period in architecture in which Pleasant Hills was constructed embraced the neoclassical in both its Roman and Greek forms: Adamesque Georgian, Federal and Greek Revival. These elements are seen at Pleasant Hills in their vernacular form. Houses such as Pleasant Hills, located in rural areas removed from large, fashionable cites, were built by local carpenter/builders using builders' guides or pattern books. In fact, the architrave molding found around the windows and doors of the first story of the main block can be found in Asher Benjamin's builder's book, The Practical House Carpenter, published in 1830 (plate 46). Benjamin outlines Grecian- influenced patterns for moldings, architraves, frontispieces, etc. As stated by Benjamin, \\"I consider it necessary that all practical house carpenters should be fully acquainted with the orders of architecture, particularly those who reside in the country, where they have no opportunity of consulting an architect.\\" Zaddock Sasscer's property included 350 acres of \\"Four Hills,\\" \\"Moore's Craft\\" and \\"Littleworth.\\" Sasscer also had an additional 400-acre \\"plantation\\", inherited from his father, on which he raised tobacco. As his will states, \\"...I wish the tobacco now on hand to be sold....\\" Also mentioned in the tax assessment records for William Sasscer is the \\"land with distillery on it... 3-3/4 acres\\" (and included in the inventory of his estate are 22 barrels). The inventory also indicates that sheep and lamb were raised on the plantation, which also included oxen, cows and pigs; and twenty-six slaves (fourteen men and boys and twelve women and children). Pleasant Hills was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The P 6 was conceived as a so-called universal locomotive. The first vehicle was manufactured in 1902 at Düsseldorf by the firm of Hohenzollern. This engine has a number of features that are characteristic of its designer, Robert Garbe: a narrow chimney located well forward and the unusual position of the boiler. As a result, and in spite of the relatively small, diameter, driving wheels (on the prototype they were only ), the locomotives were authorised to travel at up to , a speed which could not be attained in practice due to its poor riding qualities. The smokebox superheater installed on the first machines was soon replaced by a smoke tube superheater. In all, 275 engines of this class were built up to 1910. 110 examples had to be handed over after the First World War as reparations. 163 locomotives were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 37.0-1, where they were allocated the running numbers 37 001–163. The locomotives with numbers 37 201–206 were, by contrast, G 6 and P 6 class engines respectively of Lübeck-Büchen Railway (LBE), that had a different design from the Prussian locomotives. The Prussian P 6s were retired by about 1950. The few engines left after the Second World War were no longer employed by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn.

It is an outstanding and important example of a Federal style plantation house, consisting of a 2½-story main structure over a full basement with a 2-story kitchen linked by a 1-story hyphen. The kitchen wing and hyphen are typical of late eighteenth century ancillary architecture in Southern Maryland. The walls are laid in Flemish bond, and the chimneys are typical of Maryland; wide on the side, thin and high above the ridge, rising on the gable ends of the house flush with the building wall. The interior exhibits outstanding Federal style trim, including elaborate Adamesque moldings and plasterwork ornamentation such as garlands, swags, and urns applied to interior doorways and mantles. A pyramidal roof, log meat house stands on the immediate grounds. Pleasant Prospect, Winter 2016 The architectural design and unique features of the house were documented in the permanent collection of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) at the Library of Congress in 1936 and again in 1983. This documentation notes: \\"Pleasant Prospect reflects the wealth and elegance of the upper class of planters in Prince George's County during the late 18th and early 19th century. The house was unusually large and well appointed for its time, with a large hall or passage, formal parlor, separate dining room and a library in the main block of the first floor.\\" Pleasant Prospect was built c. 1798 for Dr. Isaac Duckett, described as one of the most opulent slave owners in the state. It is one of four houses built in Prince George's County during this period that were valued at $1,500 or more in the 1798 Federal Direct Tax assessment and is described in that document as \\"a new Two story Brick dwelling, very elegantly furnished with passage 20 by 16, kitchen 19 by 14, all of Brick.\\" Pleasant Prospect is one of three plantations built by the Duckett family in Prince George's County. The other two are Fairview, built by Isaac Duckett's brother Baruch around 1800, and Melford in the 1840s. Pleasant Prospect was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

The other houses of Wei and Han first participated in the battle in alliance with the Zhi, but later defected to ally with Zhao to annihilate the Zhi house. This event was a catalyst to the Tripartition of Jin in 434 BC, the forming of the three states of Zhao, Wei, and Han, and the start to the Warring States period. It is the first battle described in the Song Dynasty history compendium Zizhi Tongjian. Background By 490 BC, after the destruction of the houses of Fan (范) and Zhonghang (中行), control of the State of Jin, then the largest state in China, was contested by four elite families: Zhi, Wei, Zhao, and Han. With multiple military victories under his belt, Zhi Yao (or Zhi Bo Yao 智伯瑤) of the house of Zhi exerted the most influence in the Jin court – all decisions of the state had to pass through him. He also controlled the most territory within the state. The reigning duke of Jin, Duke Ai, was powerless to restrain him.Sima Qian vol. 39: 晉國政皆決知伯，晉哀公不得有所制。知伯遂有范、中行地，最彊。 So Zhi Yao, in his pride, began to demand lands from the other three houses. The houses of Wei and Han reluctantly complied to evade Zhi's wrath, but Zhao Xiangzi (趙襄子) refused to cede the territories of Lin (藺) and Gaolang (皋狼), both in modern-day Lishi, to Zhi.Liu vol. 18. The received Zhan Guo Ce had Cai (蔡) and Gaolang as the territories, but Cai was neither near Gaolang nor was it in Zhao. Later compilers like Sima Guang assumed that \\"Cai\\" was supposed to be \\"Lin\\". Zhi, in retribution, formed a secret alliance with the houses of Wei and Han to attack Zhao. Zhao Xiangzi suspected an attack from Zhi, since he had heard that Zhi sent envoys to Han and Wei three times, but never to Zhao. After rejecting suggestions to move to Zhangzi or Handan out of concern for the people there,Sima Guang vol. 1: 襄子將出，曰：「吾何走乎？」從者曰：「長子近，且城厚完。」襄子曰：「民罷力以完之，又斃死以守之，其誰與我！」從者曰：「邯鄲之倉庫實。」襄子曰：「浚民之膏澤以實之，又因而殺之，其誰與我！」 Zhao Xiangzi asked his minister Zhang Mengtan (張孟談) where he could prepare his defence, and Zhang Mengtan suggested Jinyang because Jinyang had been well- governed for generations. Zhao agreed, and summoned Yanling Sheng (延陵生) to lead the army carriages and cavalry ahead to Jinyang, Zhao himself to follow later. Once in Jinyang, Zhao Xiangzi, following the suggestions of Zhang Mengtan, issued orders to refill the granaries and the treasuries, repair walls, make arrows, and melt copper pillars for metal. By virtue of past governance, the treasuries, granaries, and arsenals were filled within three days, and the walls repaired within five.Watson 58. Thus all of Jinyang was prepared for war. Battle When the three armies of Zhi, Wei, and Han reached Jinyang in 455 BC, they laid siege to the city, but for three months they could not take the city. They fanned out and surrounded the city, and a year laterSima Qian vol. 43: 三國攻晉陽，歲餘，引汾水灌其城 diverted the flow of the Fen River to inundate the city. All buildings under three stories high were submerged, and the people of Jinyang were obliged to live in nest-like perches above the water and hang their kettles from the scaffolding in order to cook. By the third year, supplies had run out for the Zhao, diseases broke out, and the populace were reduced to eating each other's children.Sima Qian vol. 43: 城中懸釜而炊，易子而食。 Although the common people remained firm in the defence,Sima Guang vol.1: 沈竈產鼃，民無叛意。 the court ministers' loyalties began to waver.Sima Qian vol. 43: 群臣皆有外心，禮益慢 Zhao Xiangzi asked Zhang Mengtan, \\"Our provisions are gone, our strength and resources are exhausted, the officials are starving and ill, and I fear we can hold out no longer. I am going to surrender the city, but to which of the three states should I surrender?\\"Watson 59. Zhang Mengtan, much alarmed, persuaded Zhao not to surrender but instead send him out to negotiate with the houses of Wei and Han. The houses of Wei and Han were promised an even split of Zhao's territories when the battle was won, however both the Wei and Han leaders were uneasy, since they understood that they too would be conquered if Zhao fell to Zhi. Zhi Yao's minister, Xi Ci (郤疵), warned Zhi that the two houses were going to revolt, since \\"the men and horses [of Jinyang] are eating each other and the city is soon to fall, yet the lords of Han and Wei show no signs of joy but instead are worried. If those are not rebellious signs, then what are they?\\"Sima Guang vol. 1: 人馬相食，城降有日，而韓、魏之君無喜誌而有憂色，是非反如何也？ Zhi paid Xi Ci no heed, and instead told the lords of Han and Wei of Xi's suspicion. Xi, knowing that his warning fell to deaf ears, excused himself from the battlefield by going to the State of Qi as an envoy. Indeed, when Zhang Mengtan secretly met with Wei Huan-zi and Han Kangzi (韓康子), who confessed that they were secretly planning to mutiny against Zhi. The three discussed their plans and settled on a date to execute the plans. Zhang Mengtan returned to Jinyang to report back to Zhao Xiangzi, and Zhao, in joy and apprehension, bowed to Zhang several times as a sign of great reverence. One of Zhi Yao's clansmen, Zhi Guo (智過), by happenstance, observed the leaders of Wei and Han after the secret meeting, and warned Zhi Yao of the possibility that they might rebel, judging by their lack of restraints like before. Zhi again chose to put his trust in his two allies, saying: \\"Since I have been this good to them, they would surely not attack or deceive me. Our troops have invested Jinyang for three years. Now when the city is ready to fall at any moment and we are about to enjoy the spoils, what reason would they have for changing their minds?\\"Watson 60-61 Zhi told Wei and Han what Zhi Guo said, and the two learnt to be cautious when they saw Zhi Guo the next day. Zhi Guo, seeing the change in their looks, insisted to Zhi Yao that the two ought to be executed. Zhi Yao would not hear of it, and Zhi Guo suggested another plan to buy their friendship: to bribe the influential ministers Zhao Jia (趙葭) of Wei and Duan Gui (段規) of Han with enfeoffment of the Zhao lands. Zhi Yao rejected the proposal because the Zhao lands were going to split in three already, and he did not want to receive less than one third of the eventual spoils. Since Zhi Yao would not listen, Zhi Guo left him and changed his surname to Fu (輔) as a precaution. Hearing this, Zhang Mengtan urged Zhao Xiangzi to take action immediately, lest Zhi Yao changes his mind.Liu vol.18, commentary by Bao Biao (鮑彪): 恐智伯以過之去之決，有感動矣。 Zhao then dispatched Zhang Mengtan to the camps of Wei and Han, alerting them of the time of the final attack. On the night of May 8, 453 BC, Zhao troops killed the men guarding the dams of the Fen River and let the river flood the Zhi armies. As the Zhi armies fell into chaos trying to stop the water, the Wei and Han armies attacked Zhi from the sides and Zhao led his soldiers in a frontal attack. Together they inflicted a severe defeat on Zhi Yao's army and took him prisoner. Zhao Xiangzi had a grudge on Zhi Yao because Zhi had often humiliated him in the past, thus he executed Zhi and made his skull into a winecup.Sima Qian vol.86: 趙襄子最怨智伯，漆其頭以為飲器。 No one in the house of Zhi was spared except for Zhi Guo's family, who had already changed their surnames and fled. The territories of Zhi were evenly distributed among the three victors. Aftermath With the elimination of the Zhi house, control of the State of Jin fell to the remaining three families, their powers unchecked by anyone in the state. In 434 BC, following the death of Duke Ai, the three families annexed all of Jin's lands, leaving only the capital estates of Jiang and Quwo for the next duke of Jin. In 403 BC, the Wei, Zhao and Han lords all went to King Weilie of Zhou in Luoyang and were made marquises in their own right, establishing the three states of Zhao, Wei, and Han, ushering in the beginning of the Warring States period by Sima Guang's definition. Most historians, when referring to those three states, call them the \\"Three Jins\\" (三晉). The State of Jin continued to exist with a tiny piece of territory until 376 BC when the rest of the territory was partitioned by the Three Jins. The Legalist thinker Han Feizi of the late Warring States period used this battle as an example of failure via greed and perversity, one of the \\"Ten Faults\\" that a ruler should not have.Watson 56 He reasoned that because Zhi Yao was too fond for profit, he opened himself to the destruction of the state and his own demise. The Song Dynasty statesman Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, attribute Zhi Yao's failure to his lacking virtue compared to his talents, and thus invited disaster.Sima Guang vol. 1: 智伯之亡也，才勝德也。 Notes References *Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian *Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian *Liu Xiang et al., Zhan Guo Ce *Watson, Burton (2003).

The name Grijzegrubben contains the toponym Grubbe, which in Limburg often refers to a hollow way. The name was already in use in the year 1637, when Aleidis of Grijzegrubben leased some land to the nobleman Bartholomeus van Reymersbeeck. Archeologists found in Grijzegrubben in August 2002 the remains of a Roman farm or storehouse, originating from approximately the 2nd century.

It consists of two archipelagos around the two main islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, about apart and about off the northwestern coast of Gabon. The islands were uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century. Gradually colonized and settled by the Portuguese throughout the 16th century, they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the Atlantic slave trade. The rich volcanic soil and proximity to the Equator made São Tomé and Príncipe ideal for sugar cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as coffee and cocoa; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful independence in 1975. São Tomé and Príncipe has since remained one of Africa's most stable and democratic countries. With a population of 201,800 (2018 official estimate),Instituto Nacional de Estadística de São Tomé e Príncipe, as at 13 May 2018. Sao Tome and Principe is the second-smallest African sovereign state after Seychelles, as well as the smallest Portuguese- speaking country. Its people are predominantly of African and mestiço descent, with most practicing Catholic Christianity. The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country's culture, customs, and music, which fuse European and African influences. São Tomé and Príncipe is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. History Map of São Tomé by Johannes Vingboons (1665) = Arrival of Europeans = The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe were uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived sometime around 1470. The first Europeans to put ashore were João de Santarém and Pêro Escobar. Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland. The dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December (St Thomas's Day) 1471, for São Tomé; and 17 January (St Antony's Day) 1472, for Príncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Príncipe was initially named Santo Antão (\\"Saint Anthony\\"), changing its name in 1502 to Ilha do Príncipe (\\"Prince's Island\\"), in reference to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid. The first successful settlement of São Tomé was established in 1493 by Álvaro Caminha, who received the land as a grant from the crown. Príncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were \\"undesirables\\" sent from Portugal, mostly Jews. In time, these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar. =Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe= By 1515, São Tomé and Príncipe had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at Elmina. The cultivation of sugar was a labour- intensive process and the Portuguese began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the mainland. These slaves originated mainly from the Gold Coast, Niger Delta and in Kongo.Vogt, John L. \\"The Early Sao Tome-Principe Slave Trade with Mina, 1500-1540.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies 6, no. 3 (1973): 453-67. . Originally, the residents of São Tomé focused on cultivating provisions for themselves, sustaining their slaves, and participating in the export of slaves. A lack of value existed for the property on the island, as before the sugar boom, not much incentive remained to own land.Caldeira, Arlindo Manuel. \\"LEARNING THE ROPES IN THE TROPICS: SLAVERY AND THE PLANTATION SYSTEM ON THE ISLAND OF SÃO TOMÉ.\\" African Economic History 39 (2011): 41. . Foodstuffs often had to be imported, as cultivation on São Tomé was limited. The low value of property is emphasized by the death of a São Toméan landowner, Álvaro Borges in November, 1504. When Borges passed, his cleared land and domesticated animals were sold for merely 13,000 réis at a time when four slaves could be bought for 19,400 réis.Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo (hereinafter cited as TT), Corpo Cronológico, II, 15-77, inventory of the assets belonging to Álvaro Borges, 4 November 1507, a published copy of which is found in PMA, vol. V, 221-243. Although São Tomé, according to Valentim Fernandes around 1506, had bountiful sugarcane fields and even larger sugarcane than Madeira \\"from which they already produce molasses,\\"Th. Monod, A. Teixeira da Mota, and R. Mauny, eds., Description de la Côte Occidentale d'Afrique par Valentim Fernandes (Bissau: Centro de Estudos da Guiñé Portuguesa, 1951), 11 the island was absent of the facilities needed for industrial levels of sugar production.São Sebastião Museum in São Tomé  Economic development in the 16th century  São Tomé would only become economically noteworthy with the introduction of a land grant in 1515 of a water-powered sugar mill.Caldeira, Arlindo Manuel. \\"LEARNING THE ROPES IN THE TROPICS: SLAVERY AND THE PLANTATION SYSTEM ON THE ISLAND OF SÃO TOMÉ.\\" African Economic History 39 (2011): 43. . Just two years later in 1517, Portuguese documents highlighted the importance of these sugar mills in the mass cultivation of sugar. The documents state, \\"The fields are expanding and the sugar mills, too. At this time, only two sugar mills are here and another three are being built, counting the mill of the contractors, which is large. Similarly, the necessary conditions exist, such as streams and timber, to be able to build many more. And the [sugar] canes are the biggest I have ever seen in my life.\\" The expansion of sugar fields and production in São Tomé led to the creation of plantation[s].\\"As roças vâo em crescimento e os engenhos de açticaragora somente dois e fazem-se très com o dos tratadores [conassi há grande aparelho, assi de ribeiras como de lenha, par canas, as mais façanhosas que em minha vida vi\\": Letter from Segura to the monarch, 15 March 1517, in Antonio Brásio, édAfricana (hereinafter referred to as The creation of plantations resulted in an economic surge of sugar through slave labor. Consequently, São Tomé's economy was based in sugar production and the slave trade. By the mid-16th century, the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar. Slaves in São Tomé were bought from the Slave Coast of West Africa, the Niger Delta, the island Fernando Po, then later from the Kongo and Angola.Vogt, John L. \\"The Early Sao Tome-Principe Slave Trade with Mina, 1500-1540.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies 6, no. 3 (1973): 462. . In the 16th century, the enslaved were imported from and exported to Portugal, Elmina, the Kingdom of Kongo, Angola, and the Spanish Americas. In 1510, reportedly 10,000 to 12,000 slaves were imported by Portugal.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 66. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Then in 1516, São Tomé received 4,072 slaves with the purpose of re-exportation. As a result, in 1519 the island became the center of the slave trade between Elmina and the Niger Delta up until 1540.Vogt, John L. \\"The Early Sao Tome-Principe Slave Trade with Mina, 1500-1540.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies 6, no. 3 (1973): 467. {doi10.2307/216611}}. Throughout the early to mid sixteenth century, São Tomé was additionally harboring slave trade relationships intermittently with Angola and the Kingdom of Kongo.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 67. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Furthermore, in 1525 São Tomé began its slave trade relationship with the Spanish Americas.Vogt, John L. \\"The Early Sao Tome- Principe Slave Trade with Mina, 1500-1540.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies 6, no. 3 (1973): 466. . Most of the slaves to the Spanish Americas went to the Caribbean and Brazil. In the period between 1532 and 1536, every year São Tomé sent an average of 342 slaves to the Antilles.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 68. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Prior to 1580, the island accounted for 75 percent of Brazil's imports, mainly exporting slaves. The slave trade was a cornerstone of São Tomé's economy all the way until the beginning of the seventeenth century. The power dynamics of São Tomé in the 16th century were surprisingly diverse with the participation of free mulatto[s] and black citizens in governance. Due to the minimal amounts of voluntary colonists, who actively avoided inhabiting São Tomé because of the presence of disease and food shortages, the crown deported convicts to the island and encouraged interracial relationships to secure the settlement. Slavery was also not permanent, as demonstrated through the 1515 royal decree granting the manumission to African wives of white settlers and their mixed-race children.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 59. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Then in 1517, another royal decree freed the male slaves who had originally arrived on the island with the first colonists. After 1520, a royal charter allowed for property-owning, married, free mulattos to hold public offices. This was followed by a royal decree in 1546 that equated these qualified mulattos with the white settlers. Consequently, free mulattos and black citizens enjoyed opportunities for upward mobility and participated in local politics and economy. Compounded with the participation of deported convicts and white settlers in government, frequent disputes occurred in the governance of São Tomé, which consisted of town councils, a governor, and a bishop.Seibert, Gerhard. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 60. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . These quarrels meant that São Tomé was constantly politically unstable. Island of São Tomé (Saint Thomas) in 1645 Slavery in São Tomé was originally much less structured because of the scarcity of resources on the island. In the mid-16th century, an anonymous Portuguese pilot noted that the slaves were employed as couples, built their own accommodations, and worked autonomously once a week on the cultivation of their own food supply.For an English translation, see John William Blake, trans., ed., Europeans in West Africa, 1450–1560 (London, 1942), 145ff. However, this more relaxed slave system did not last long following the introduction of plantations. From the onset of slavery in São Tomé, slaves frequently ran away to the mountainous interior of the island.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 63. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Between 1514 and 1527, five percent of slaves that were imported to São Tomé escaped. These runaway slaves frequently starved to death, as there were few crops and edible animals in the tropical mountains of the island.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 64. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . Ironically, the lack of food on the sugar plantations especially between 1531 and 1535 was one of the main reasons slaves attempted to escape. Eventually, the Maroon (people) developed settlements in the interior of the island known as macambos.  Slave Rebellions  The first signs of slave rebellion began in the 1530s, when the maroon gangs organized and attacked plantations. As a result, more plantations were abandoned. The attacks became so common that a formal complaint was lodged by local Portuguese authorities in 1531 claiming that too many settlers and black citizens were being killed in the fights, and that the island would be lost if the problem remained unresolved. As a solution, in 1533 local authorities engaged in a 'bush war' led by a 'bush captain' using militia units to suppress the maroon combatants. A significant event in the maroon fight for freedom occurred in 1549, when two men claiming to have been born free men from the macambos were taken in by a wealthy mulatto planter named Ana de Chaves. With the support of de Chaves, the two men sent in a petition to the king to be labeled free men instead of slaves. The monarch ended up approving the request. The largest occurrence of marronage happened simultaneously to the sugar boom of the mid-16th century, when the number of plantation slaves increased exponentially. Between 1587 and 1590, many of the runaway slaves were defeated as a result of the bush war.SEIBERT, GERHARD. \\"São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics.\\" In Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa, edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 65. Boydell and Brewer, 2013. . However, in 1593 the slaves regrouped and reorganized only for later that year, according to the governor at the time, to be almost completely extinguished.Caldeira,‘Rebelião e Outras Formas de Resistência’, 111. Despite the counter-revolutionary efforts by the authorities, the settlers were unable to inhabit the southern and western parts of São Tomé, because of their proximity to the maroons. The greatest slave revolt in São Tomé occurred in July 1595, during a period when the government was weakened by disputes between the bishop and the governor. The revolt, which was headed by a native slave named Amador, was successful in uniting 5000 slaves in an effort to raid and destroy plantations, sugar mills, and settler's houses. Amador and his rebellion unsuccessfully attempted to raid the town three times before eventually, after three weeks, they were defeated by the militia. Two hundred slaves were killed in combat, and Amador and the other rebel leaders were executed. The rest of the slaves were granted amnesty and returned to their plantations. Amador's revolt had successfully destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills in one of the greatest slave uprisings in history. Smaller slavery rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries.  São Tomé and Príncipe in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries  Eventually, competition from sugar- producing colonies in the Western Hemisphere began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, the economy of São Tomé had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the slave trade between the West and continental Africa. In the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced. The rich, volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (known as roças), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland.[citation needed] By 1908, São Tomé had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop. The roças system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. Scientific American documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in São Tomé in its 13 March 1897 issue. In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that Angolan contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This \\"Batepá Massacre\\" remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government. =Independence (1975)= The cathedral of São Tomé By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of São Toméans had formed the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby Gabon. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the Caetano dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974. The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, their representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, São Tomé and Príncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General Manuel Pinto da Costa. In 1990, São Tomé became one of the first African countries to undergo democratic reform, and changes to the constitution – the legalization of opposition political parties – led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. Miguel Trovoada, a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in São Tomé's second multiparty presidential election in 1996. The Party of Democratic Convergence won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections. Presidential elections were held in July 2001. The candidate backed by the Independent Democratic Action party, Fradique de Menezes, was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments was formed. The army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office. The cohabitation period ended in March 2006, when a propresidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.Gerhard Seibert (2006), Comrades, Clients and Cousins: Colonialism, Socialism and Democratization in São Tomé and Príncipe, Leiden: Brill. In the 30 July 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates Patrice Trovoada (son of former President Miguel Trovoada) and independent Nilo Guimarães. Local elections, the first since 1992, took place on 27 August 2006 and were dominated by members of the ruling coalition. On 12 February 2009, a coup d'état was attempted to overthrow President Fradique de Menezes. The plotters were imprisoned, but later received a pardon from President de Menezes.Sao Tome president pardons coup plotter. Orange Botswana Portal. January 7, 2010. Politics Presidential Palace of São Tomé e Príncipe The president of the republic is elected to a five-year term by direct universal suffrage and a secret ballot, and must gain an outright majority to be elected. The president may hold up to two consecutive terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president, and the 14 members of cabinet are chosen by the prime minister. The National Assembly, the supreme organ of the state and the highest legislative body, is made up of 55 members, who are elected for a four-year term and meet semiannually. Justice is administered at the highest level by the Supreme Court. The judiciary is independent under the current constitution. = Political culture = São Tomé and Príncipe has functioned under a multiparty system since 1990. With regard to human rights, there are freedom of speech and the freedom to form opposition political parties. São Tomé and Príncipe finished 11th out of the African countries measured by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance in 2010, a comprehensive reflection of the levels of governance in Africa. São Tomé and Principe is considered a free country. With very high freedom of speech, high political freedom and average economic freedom. In terms of corruption, São Tomé and Principe is a country with average corruption, in recent years the corruption has been decreasing. In tourism terms, the risk is low, equivalent to the risk of visiting France, for example. = Foreign relations = São Tomé and Príncipe has embassies in Angola, Belgium, Gabon, Portugal, and the United States. It recognized the People's Republic of China in 2016. It also has a permanent mission to the UN in New York City and an International Diplomatic Correspondent Office. São Tomé and Príncipe is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, and international organization and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents, where Portuguese is an official language. The countries with the best relations with São Tomé and Príncipe are Portugal and Angola. The presidents of Portugal and São Tomé and Príncipe in 2018, during the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to São Tomé and Príncipe.  Portugal  Portugal has historical ties with São Tomé and Príncipe, from the period of colonization by the Portuguese. Portugal is the largest investor in São Tomé and Príncipe, investing millions of euros in the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe. São Tomé and Príncipe maintains an embassy in Lisbon, a consulate in Porto and one in Coimbra. Portugal maintains an embassy in São Tomé. Portugal and São Tomé and Príncipe signed an agreement, in which Portugal undertakes to patrol the coastal area of São Tomé and Príncipe, protecting it mainly from pirates. The Portuguese military ship NRP Zaire and some Portuguese patrol boats are permanently stationed on the coast of São Tomé and Príncipe. The economy of São Tomé and Príncipe is closely linked to that of Portugal, with Portugal accounting for more than 50% of imports from São Tomé and Príncipe. Portugal has also helped to develop education in São Tomé and Príncipe, financially helping to build and maintain the Public University of São Tomé and Príncipe. The portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited Sao Tome and Principe in 2018 to demonstrate the strong economic and cultural ties between Portugal and São Tome and Principe.  Angola  Angola is a major business partner mainly in the area of natural energy resources, Angola is the major supplier of oil and natural gas to São Tomé and Príncipe. In addition, hundreds of Angolan tourists visit São Tomé and Príncipe every year, contributing to the local economy. There is a relatively large community of Angolans in São Tomé and Príncipe. São Tomé and Príncipe maintains an embassy in Luanda and Angola maintains an embassy in São Tomé.Santomean personnel undergo medical training with US Naval corpsmen  United States  The United States has had relations with São Tomé and Príncipe since 1975, the United States has offered millions of dollars in financial aid packages to São Tomé and Príncipe. The financial aid packages were designed to develop the country's infrastructure and improve its fiscal, tax and customs administration. In addition, in recent years, some US Coast Guard ships have visited São Tomé and Príncipe, providing medical and military training to soldiers from São Tomé and Príncipe. In 2002, the US had plans to establish a small military base on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe accepted the construction of the base, but the plan was canceled due to US political and financial issues. In 1992, the US federal government broadcaster, Voice of America, and the government of São Tomé signed a long-term agreement to establish a relay broadcasting station in São Tomé. Voice of America currently broadcasts to much of the Africa from this facility.  Others  Thousands of tourists from Cape Verde visit São Tomé and Príncipe, helping the local economy. Relations between Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe have improved over the years. In recent years, Poland and Germany have been increasing commercial ties with São Tomé and Príncipe, buying more and more cocoa and other products from São Tomé and Príncipe India also has very good relations with São Tomé and Príncipe, investing thousands of euros annually in the agricultural sector. Brazil has contributed to improving the health and education system in São Tomé and Príncipe, Brazilian television channels and films are the most watched in São Tomé and Príncipe. Neighboring Gabon, Cameroon and the Republic of Congo are important partners in São Tomé and Príncipe, many companies in these countries have establishments and businesses in São Tomé and Príncipe. Because these countries speak French, the language has become important in the business sector (together with Portuguese), in São Tomé and Príncipe. Since 2013, China has invested in some road and sea port projects but investments have been stalling in recent years. = Military = São Tomé and Príncipe's military is small and consists of four branches: the Army (Exército), Coast Guard (Guarda Costeira also called \\"Navy\\"), Presidential Guard (Guarda Presidencial), and the National Guard. In 2017, São Tomé and Príncipe signed the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. = Administrative divisions = In 1977, two years after independence, the country was divided into two provinces (São Tomé Province and Príncipe Province) and six districts. Since the new constitution was adopted in 1990, the provinces have been abolished, and the districts are the only administrative subdivisions. Since 29 April 1995, the island of Príncipe is an autonomous region, coterminous with the district of Pagué. The larger island of São Tomé is divided into six districts and Príncipe island into one: São Tomé Island *Água Grande *Cantagalo *Caué *Lembá *Lobata *Mé-Zóchi Príncipe Island *Pagué Geography A view of Praia Inhame, Caué District, São Tomé. The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, situated in the equatorial Atlantic and Gulf of Guinea about , respectively, off the northwest coast of Gabon, constitute Africa's second-smallest country. Both are part of the Cameroon volcanic mountain line, which also includes the islands of Annobón to the southwest, Bioko to the northeast (both part of Equatorial Guinea), and Mount Cameroon on the coast of Gulf of Guinea. São Tomé is long and wide and the more mountainous of the two islands. Its peaks reach – Pico de São Tomé. Príncipe is about long and wide. Its peaks reach – Pico de Príncipe. Swift streams radiating down the mountains through lush forest and cropland to the sea cross both islands. The Equator lies immediately south of São Tomé Island, passing through the islet Ilhéu das Rolas. The Pico Cão Grande (Great Dog Peak) is a landmark volcanic plug peak, at in southern São Tomé. It rises over above the surrounding terrain and the summit is above sea level. Ilhéu das Rolas =Climate= At sea level, the climate is tropical—hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about and little daily variation. The temperature rarely rises beyond . At the interior's higher elevations, the average yearly temperature is , and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from on the southwestern slopes to in the northern lowlands. The rainy season is from October to May. =Wildlife= São Tomé and Príncipe does not have a large number of native mammals (although the São Tomé shrew and several bat species are endemic). The islands are home to a larger number of endemic birds and plants, including the world's smallest ibis (the São Tomé ibis), the world's largest sunbird (the giant sunbird), the rare São Tomé fiscal, and several giant species of Begonia. São Tomé and Principe is an important marine turtle-nesting site, including the hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata). Economy GDP Sao Tome and Principe - millions USD (data and forecast) = Agriculture = Since the 19th century, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The main crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee. Domestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports most of its food. In 1997, an estimated 90% of the country's food needs are met through imports. Efforts have been made by the government in recent years to expand food production, and several projects have been undertaken, largely financed by foreign donors. Mercado Côco-côco, a marketplace in the city of São Tomé São Tomé town centreOther than agriculture, the main economic activities are fishing and a small industrial sector engaged in processing local agricultural products and producing a few basic consumer goods. The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment. Following independence, the country had a centrally directed economy, with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a mixed economy, with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production. = Government measures = In the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of São Tomé encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Plantation land was seized, resulting in the complete collapse of cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped. In response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far- reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an International Monetary Fund structural adjustment program, and invited greater private participation in management of the parastatals, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors. The São Toméan government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the European Union, Portugal, Taiwan, and the African Development Bank. In April 2000, in association with the Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipe, the IMF approved a poverty-reduction and growth facility for São Tomé aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit. In late 2000, São Tomé qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF–World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. The reduction is being reevaluated by the IMF, due to the attempted coup d'état in July 2003 and subsequent emergency spending. Following the truce, the IMF decided to send a mission to São Tomé to evaluate the macroeconomic state of the country. This evaluation is ongoing, reportedly pending oil legislation to determine how the government will manage incoming oil revenues, which are still poorly defined, but in any case expected to change the economic situation dramatically. In parallel, some efforts have been made to incentivize private tourism initiatives, but their scope remains limited.Brígida Rocha Brito and others, Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos, Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010 São Tomé also hosts a broadcasting station of the American International Broadcasting Bureau for the Voice of AmericaWorld Radio TV Handbook (WRTH) Vol. 49 • 1995, p. 162; Billboard Publications , Amsterdam 1995. at Pinheira.WRTH 1997, p. 514, Portugal remains one of São Tomé's major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports. Food, manufactured articles, machinery, and transportation equipment are imported primarily from the EU. = Economic challenges = In the past few years, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has grown, driven by agriculture, tourism and foreign investments, but mainly grew due to government spending driven by foreign loans. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 5.5% between 2009 and 2017, but has slowed since 2014. The slowdown in economic growth was caused by lower government spending due to decreased foreign loans and decreased revenue government tax. The biggest challenges for the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe are limited workforce, the fact that São Tomé and Príncipe is an archipelago, small domestic market, climatic fluctuations, global warming, scarce diplomatic resources and reducing poverty. For long-term economic growth, the government is trying to stimulate various sectors of the economy, diversify the economy, cut government spending and encourage private sector and foreign investment. A lot of business has been created in recent years in São Tomé and Príncipe = Positive aspects = São Tomé International AirportSão Tomé and Príncipe outperforms the sub-Saharan Africa average on the Human Development Index and has made great progress on most social indicators. All children in São Tomé and Príncipe are enrolled in the education system, life expectancy has increased to 70 years, the infant mortality rate has decreased dramatically and the vast majority of the population already has access to piped water and access to electricity. In terms of business, the government of São Tomé and Príncipe has passed several laws that facilitate the creation of private businesses and foreign investments. Between 2015 and 2019 the number of businesses and small businesses increased a lot. This increase led to a decrease in unemployment, an increase in exports and the creation of several manufactures. In the coming years a significant economic increase is expected.  Tourism  The tourism sector has great potential to be a way of diversifying the country's economy. This sector has been expanding with the increase of foreign investment. Large resorts have been built on the beaches of São Tomé and Príncipe.  Transports  The main ports in the country are in the city of São Tomé and Neves, both on the island of São Tomé, which were very degraded were modernized in 2014. Close to the city of São Tomé, the international airport was expanded and modernized. The telephone system and the road network are good by African standards. The use of the cell phone is widely used and has been improved in recent years. The Internet service is available and has been widely installed in urban areas.International Bank of São Tomé e Príncipealt=left =Petroleum exploration= In 2001, São Tomé and Nigeria reached agreement on joint exploration for petroleum in waters claimed by the two countries of the Niger Delta geologic province. After a lengthy series of negotiations, in April 2003, the joint development zone (JDZ) was opened for bids by international oil firms. The JDZ was divided into nine blocks; the winning bids for block one, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and the Norwegian firm, Equity Energy, were announced in April 2004, with São Tomé to take in 40% of the $123 million bid, and Nigeria the other 60%. Bids on other blocks were still under consideration in October 2004. São Tomé has received more than $2 million from the bank to develop its petroleum sector. =Banking= Banco Central de Sāo Tomé e Príncipe is the central bank, responsible for monetary policy and bank supervision. Six banks are in the country; the largest and oldest is Banco Internacional de São Tomé e Príncipe, which is a subsidiary of Portugal's government-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos. It had a monopoly on commercial banking until a change in the banking law in 2003 led to the entry of several other banks. = Business partners =  Exports  In 2018 exports from São Tomé and Príncipe totaled 24 million euros. An increase of 118% in 5 years as in 2013 exports from São Tomé and Príncipe totaled only 11 million euros. Half of São Tomé and Príncipe's exports are cocoa beans. One fifth of exports are electrical machines. Other considerable exports are parts of airplanes, cars, iron, plastics, agricultural products (pepper, oils, nuts and beef). The main destinations for exports from São Tomé and Príncipe are Europe, where the Netherlands (19%), Portugal (14%), Poland (13%), France (7%) and Germany (6%) stand out. Others important buyers are Singapore, Japan, Brazil and the United States. The most important import partners of Sao Tome and Principe (2018) In the last 10 years, the countries in which the value of exports increased the most were Portugal, Poland, Brazil and the Netherlands. There was a sharp decrease in exports from São Tomé and Príncipe to Angola, Mexico and India.  Imports  In 2018, imports from São Tomé and Príncipe totaled 161 million euros. Since 2013, imports have been decreasing, albeit at a slow pace, since in 2013 imports totaled 167 million euros. A fifth of imports from São Tomé and Príncipe corresponded to refined oil (mainly from Angola). Other important imports, in order of importance, were cars, rice, cereals, wine, electronic equipment, chemicals, clothing, meat, medical equipment and wood. About 51%, more than half of the imports from São Tomé and Príncipe come from Portugal. A fifth of imports come from Angola, about 6% come from China, 4% from the USA, 4% from Brazil, 2% from Gabon and 2% from France. In the last 10 years, the countries in which the value of imports increased the most were Portugal, Angola and China. There was a sharp decrease in imports from Thailand, Italy and Nigeria. = Portugal = From Portugal, what São Tomé and Príncipe imports most are machines, mainly electric generators and computers, a lot of food, mainly wine, wheat, rice, milk and soy oil. In addition, São Tomé and Príncipe also imports in considerable quantities from Portugal, cars, soap and iron. Portugal mainly buys scrap material, copper, cocoa and clothing.  Society  =Demographics= Santomeans on the beach, Lobata District São Tomé and Príncipe's population in thousands between 1961 and 2003 A scene of Santomean Tchioli, Auto de Floripes Festival The total population is estimated at 201,800 in May 2018 by the government agency. About 193,380 people live on São Tomé and 8,420 on Príncipe. Natural increase is about 4,000 people per year. Nearly all are descended from people from different countries taken to the islands by the Portuguese from 1470 onwards. In the 1970s, two significant population movements occurred — the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred São Tomé refugees from Angola. = Ethnic groups = Distinct ethnic groups on São Tomé and Príncipe include: * Mestiços, or mixed-blood, are descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as filhos da terra or \\"children of the land\\"). * Angolares are reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing. * Forros are descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished. * Serviçais are contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde, living temporarily on the islands. * Tongas are children of serviçais born on the islands. * Europeans, primarily Portuguese * Asians, mostly Chinese, including Macanese people of mixed Portuguese and Chinese descent from MacauLanguages in São Tomé and Príncipe = Languages = Portuguese is the official and the de facto national language of São Tomé and Príncipe, with about 98.4% speaking it, a significant share as their native language, and it has been spoken in the islands since the end of the 15th century.

Primary school enrollment and attendance rates were unavailable for São Tomé and Príncipe as of 2001. The educational system has a shortage of classrooms, insufficiently trained and underpaid teachers, inadequate textbooks and materials, high rates of repetition, poor educational planning and management, and a lack of community involvement in school management. Domestic financing of the school system is lacking, leaving the system highly dependent on foreign financing. Tertiary institutions are the National Lyceum (São Tomé and Príncipe) and the University of São Tomé and Príncipe. Culture São Toméan culture is a mixture of African and Portuguese influences. = Music = São Toméans are known for ússua and socopé rhythms, while Príncipe is home to the dêxa beat.

Polish-Romanian relations are foreign relations between Poland and Romania. Most famous for the relation between association football referee Bartosz Frankowski from Poland and the football team CFR Cluj from Romania. Both countries established diplomatic relations on February 9, 1919. In recent years government representatives of Poland and Romania regularly exchange high-level visits, a reflection of the mutual interest in bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Both are full members of NATO and of the European Union and are the two most populous nations to join either bloc since the end of the Cold War. The Warsaw Institute, a Polish think tank, maintains a Romania Monitor to explain the main course of political, economical and social developments in Romania and Moldova. History =Beginnings= The beginnings of Polish influence in Romania can be traced back to the 14th century with the founding of the Principality of Moldavia. Trade between the Baltic and Black Seas between the two neighboring countries facilitated their growing bond. During this era Moldavia was a vassal state of first the Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth several times Marcin Kosienkowski, \\"Polska a Mołdawia i Naddniestrze\\" =Polish-Romanian Alliance= Beginning in 1921, a series of treaties were signed in the interwar period by the Second Polish Republic and the Kingdom of Romania which created the Polish–Romanian Alliance. The treaties formed a basis for good foreign relations between the two countries that lasted until World War II began in 1939. Hugh Ragsdale, The Soviets, the Munich Crisis, and the Coming of World War II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge =Possible dynastic union between Poland and Romania= After the Sanacja movement seized power in Poland with the May Coup, Poland and Romania signed a Guarantee Treaty on January 15, 1931. Rumours in Poland that Piłsudski was considering Prince Nicholas, Romania's former regent, for the vacant Polish throne were encouraged by conservative politicians, such as Janusz Radziwiłł in October of that year.Edmund Jan Osmanczyk, Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements, Routledge, London, 2002, p. 1815 During the Polish leader's visit to Romania in that month, Radziwiłł spoke in the Senate about the possibility of a monarchic revival. That was interpreted by Zdzisław Lubomirski to be the result of \\"an indication coming from [Piłsudski]\\". In 1932, the Romanian prime minister, Nicolae Iorga, was informed by the ambassador in Warsaw, Grigore Bilciurescu, that conservative groups were considering the possibility of a personal union with Carol II of Romania as the king of both countries.

The majority of those troops joined the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in the West in France and the United Kingdom in 1939 and 1940. Because of their escape through Romania, the Polish army was one of the largest forces of the Allies prior to the United States entering the war and Germany's attack on the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa).Kwan Yuk Pan, \\"Polish veterans to take pride of place in victory parade\\", Financial Times, May 25, 2007.

Adrian Barber, the stage manager at the Star Club, on the instructions by King Size Taylor, the leader of The Dominoes, another group from Liverpool, recorded this on a Grundig home tape recorder at 3 ips in December 1962, probably during three performances at Hamburg's Star Club on 25, 28 or 29 and 30 December. Though even The Beatles thought the sound quality was too poor for anything to be made of the recording, Lingasong Records spent about $100,000 rebuilding the sound into a 16-track master. The result of their effort is this recording. This recording includes Ringo Starr on drums, making this the first live recording of The Beatles. This same recording was previously released as Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 by Lingasong Records. Pickwick's version has been slightly altered to allow for more prominence in the vocals. Two songs on the set, \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" and \\"Halleluja, I Love Her So,\\" feature the Beatles performing the instruments while Star-Club waiter, Horst Fascher provides the vocals.

Advanced Research Projects Agency had announced a series of funding for six projects in natural language understanding in 1970, which influenced Hendrix's decision to study in the artificial intelligence field. In January 1971, he enrolled in the PhD program at the University of Texas, and was assigned Robert Simmons as his adviser. He completed his dissertation in 1975. Career While at the University of Texas, Hendrix published several papers on robotics and planning, which several people from SRI International read. This led to an invitation for him to work at SRI, which he accepted and subsequently moved to Menlo Park, California. After several years at SRI, he left with fifteen SRI employees to form Machine Intelligence Corporation, which ultimately failed. Afterward, he founded Symantec Corporation in 1982 with the help of a National Science Foundation grant. The company was originally focused on artificial intelligence-related projects, and Hendrix hired several Stanford University natural language processing researchers as the company's first employees. To finance the company, Hendrix went to an American Electronics Association financial conference in Monterey, California in May 1983. After demonstrating their product on an early Apple computer, businesses became interested in obtaining their product. Hendrix left the company in 1991 and moved to Dripping Springs, Texas.

He appeared in more than 130 films between 1931 and 1984, mostly in supporting roles. He was born in Brandenburg, Germany and died in Heppenheim, Germany. Life and career Hans Richter made his film debut as \\"Fliegender Hirsch\\" in Gerhard Lamprecht's Emil and the Detectives (1931), based on the novel of the same name by Erich Kästner. In the following years, Richter become a popular juvenile actor; often playing clever, somewhat cheeky boys (a type similar to Mickey Rooney in the American film during the 1930s). When he reached legal age, he had appeared in over 50 films. After his supporting role as a lazy schoolboy in Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944), Richter got drafted into the German Wehrmacht and was also in war imprisonment for some time. After the World War, Richter worked as a cabaret artist and also appeared in numerous of the popular Heimatfilms, among them The Black Forest Girl (1950) and The Heath Is Green (1951). He also worked as a film director on two films during the 1950s: Vatertag and Hurrah – Die Firma hat ein Kind, both released in 1955. Since the late 1950s, Richter moved more and more to theatre work, making only sparsely film and television appearances during his later years. He appeared at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus and the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt. In 1974, he founded the Festspiele Heppenheim, a summer theatre, in which he worked as an actor/director/producer until his retirement in the 1990s.

Global warming  Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland = Effects = Greenland is one of the areas in both the Nordic region and the world most affected by climate change. A July 2006 study completed by \\"The Journal of Climate\\", determined that the melting of Greenland's ice sheets was the single largest contributor to global sea-level rise. The temperatures from the year 2000 to the present have caused several very large glaciers that had long been stable, to begin to melt away. Three glaciers that have been researched: Jakobshavn Isbræ, Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers, jointly drain more than 16% of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. In 2001, the ice sheet began retreating rapidly, retreating between 2001 and 2005. It has also accelerated from to a day. Western Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbræ is generally considered the fastest moving glacier in the world, and has been moving continuously at speeds of over a day with a stable terminus since at least 1950. The glacier's ice tongue began to break apart in 2000, leading to almost complete disintegration in 2003, while the retreat rate doubled to over per day. In the summer of 2005, the island of Uunartoq Qeqertoq was discovered off the eastern central coast of Greenland. Prior to 2005, many people assumed that Uunartoq Qeqertoq was actually a peninsula off Liverpool Land, however, the melting ice shelves revealed that it was only connected to the mainland by glacial ice. = Predicted effects = Scientists estimate that should the current rate of climate change continue, Greenland's ice sheet, which contains of ice, could melt and cause global sea level to rise by .

Early relations =Middle ages= Both countries have a long common history. For the first time united from 1253 until 1276 under the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia, they later joined again and, together with Hungary, formed a major European power under the Habsburg dynasty which lasted from 1526 until 1918. Initially only a personal union, the ever more centralized monarchy ruled mostly from Vienna (Prague was the capital only from 1583 until 1611) was increasingly seen as an obstacle of the Czech and German national interests during the uprising of nationalism in Central Europe from the second half of the 19th century. The Czechs demanded to be ruled by a government in Prague, the capital city of their kingdom, not in Vienna, and as part of their main party strategy of passive resistance did not participate for years in the political discussions and decisions of the Austrian Reichsrat, the parliament in Vienna representing all nations of the Austrian part of the Austro- Hungarían Monarchy. Ethnic Germans at the same time wanted to participate in the ongoing German unification process. =Early modern period= While the emperor had given internal autonomy to the Hungarians in 1867 to reduce tensions with the Magyar aristocracy, the Czechs' wishes never were fulfilled until the end of the empire in 1918. This was due to the fact that in Bohemia 37% and in Moravia 28% of the population were Germans, who fiercely opposed to represent a minority in a Czech parliament, while they were part of the leading nation in Cisleithania. Although the Czech lands developed as the industrial centre of the Monarchy, hundreds of thousand Bohemians of poor personal living standard, mainly from agricultural areas of southern Moravia, moved to Vienna between 1870 and 1910 to work there in cheap jobs. Badly educated and not capable of much German language as some of them were, they were considered low class people by the Viennese, and Böhm or Bem (which, in Viennese dialect, means a person from Bohemia) was used pejorative long into the 20th century in Austria. Aside from these the imperial capital attracted a large number of middle-class Bohemians who studied or pursued careers there, including Sigmund Freud, Karel Rokytanský, Gustav Mahler, the future president of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and many others. Until today, one may trace Czech migrants in the Vienna Telephone Directory (from Adamec to Zwierzina). =Early republics and world wars= South Moravia was the birthplace of two federal presidents of Austria: Karl Renner, who decisively took part in the creation of the First Austrian Republik in 1918 as State Chancellor and was president from 1945 to 1950, in 1870 was born at Untertannowitz / Dolni Dunajovice in the so-called Dyje arc (Thayabogen). Adolf Schärf, vice chancellor from 1945 to 1957 and president from 1957 to 1965, in 1873 was born in the city of Nikolsburg / Mikulov near the Austrian border. Many aristocratic and bourgeois families of great influence in Austrian politics, economy and the arts had their roots in what is now the Czech Republic. During the First World War, while nearly 1.5 million Czechs fought in the Austro-Hungarian army, exiled Czech politicians backed by the military legions worked on the regaining of the independence of Bohemia in the form of Czech-Slovak union. The Entente powers supported their plans, which did not provide any autonomy or other special treatment for the Germans in the new country. After the end of the empire in October and November, 1918, German Austria and Czechoslovakia shortly quarreled on the issue of the German districts in Bohemia and Moravia, where more than 3 million German inhabitants wanted to join the State of German Austria (and within this state, the German republic). The Czechs immediately occupied these districts to keep the \\"integrity of the Bohemian lands\\", and the Treaty of St. Germain of 1919 acknowledged their rights to keep them. Both countries established diplomatic relations on January 20, 1920. When Austria entered dictatorial rule in 1934, Austrian Social Democrats like Otto Bauer and Julius Deutsch found refuge in the Czechoslovak Republic and founded the ALÖS (Auslandsbüro der österreichischen Sozialdemokraten), the foreign bureau of Austrian Social Democrats, in Brno. There until 1938 they published the Arbeiter-Zeitung (literally the workers' newspaper), which had been the daily organ of the Social Democratic Party of Austria and been prohibited by the Austrofascists, to be \\"illegally\\" exported to Austria. In March, 1938, when Austria was annexed to Germany, again some politicians flew to the neighboring country, at this time together with Switzerland the only democracy in Central Europe. =Cold War era= Many Germans in the Czech lands joyfully had welcomed Hitler's annexation of the German districts, called Sudetenland, in September 1938, and had taken part in the occupation of the remaining Czech area in March 1939. This led the Czechs to expel nearly all Germans in 1945 and 1947. The properties these people had to leave behind when moving to their new countries of residence have been in fact nationalized and then redistributed among the Czech population under set rules. Although war damages exceeded value of these properties, Czechoslovakia did not claim any reparations from Germany and Austria and considered transfer of these properties ownership the fastest and most efficient way how to recover the nation after the world war. Many of people expelled moved to the Western zones of occupied Germany, some of them settled in Austria. Some people, however, were either allowed to stay or return to the country when proving their innocence. In 1948, the Iron Curtain went down between Czechoslovakia and Austria. Many railway tracks and roads connecting the two countries were closed down for a long time. (Railway traffic from Laa an der Thaya to Hevlin and from Fratres to Slavonice has not been reopened until 2009.) In 1968, at the end of the Prague Spring, many Czechs fled to Austria. In 1978, the Czech author Pavel Kohout started to work for the Burgtheater in Vienna; his and his wife's Czechoslovak citizenship subsequently was revoked in 1979 and both were granted Austrian citizenship. Modern relations In late 1989, the Czechs for the first time after 40 years could enter Austria as free citizens. In the nineties, Austrian ecologists demonstrated against the nuclear power plant at Temelin, 50 kilometres north of the Austrian border to the Czech Republic. In 2000, in the so-called Protocol of Melk,Radio Praha website the two governments agreed on certain nuclear safety standards and cross-border information without delay. In 2008, Karl Schwarzenberg (Czech minister of foreign affairs) and Jiri Grusa, who has acted as Czech ambassador and as director of the Diplomatic Academy in Vienna, shared the opinion that Austrians and Czechs are of different language, but of \\"the same nation\\", the same character.Falter, weekly paper, Vienna, No. 50/08 of 10 December 2008, p. 18; and Website of the Diplomatic Academy, Vienna Schwarzenberg himself had lived in Vienna for decades before returning to the Czech lands after 1989.

History The United Kingdom and Czechoslovakia historically had lukewarm, although not hostile, relations largely due to Britain's lack of involvement in continental Europe beyond France and Czechoslovakia being caught in between the mostly capitalist Allied countries and the Soviet Union. Initially the two nations were allies and trading partners during the years prior to World War II. Ties were somewhat strained when Nazi Germany annexed much of the country under the terms of the Munich Agreement (1938), which many Czechs viewed as the \\"Munich betrayal\\" (). Over 500 Czech pilots, most of whom had fled the Nazi occupation to Allied countries, served with Royal Air Force and gained distinction during the Battle of Britain for their bravery and skills. One such pilot was Josef František, a Distinguished Flying Medal recipient and one of only two non-Commonwealth nationals among \\"The Few\\" who were the top ten leading aces. Britain was one of several countries Czech Jewish refugees fled to, most notably through Kindertransport. British Foreign Secretary William Hague meeting Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lubomír Zaorálek in London, May 2014. During the Cold War, relations again worsened as Britain was an ally of the United States, the \\"enemy\\" of the Soviet Union, making Britain and the Socialist-ruled Czechoslovakia \\"enemies\\" by association. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, economic relations have largely normalised, although neither countries are priority allies for the other. Trade Bilateral trade was worth £6.7 billion in 2011. Migration The 2001 UK Census recorded 12,220 Czech-born people resident in the UK. With the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union in May 2004, Czechs gained the right to live and work elsewhere in the EU, and substantial numbers moved to the UK for work, although there has been substantial return migration. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, as of October 2010 to September 2011, 24,000 to 40,000 Czech-born people were living in the UK. State visits Queen Elizabeth II paid a state visit to the Czech Republic in March 1996, she visited Prague and Brno and was received by President Václav Havel.

Biography =Early life and background= Keith Muspratt was born in Bournemouth, Hampshire, the youngest of three sons of Charles Drummond Muspratt, MD (1859–1927), a surgeon, and his wife Mabel, the daughter of the Right Honourable Sir H. Knox. His older brother Captain Terence Petty Muspratt, MC, of the Worcestershire Regiment, was killed in action on 29 May 1918, aged 22, and is buried at Terlincthun British Cemetery, Wimille, France. Muspratt was educated at Wychwood School in Bournemouth, and in 1911, aged 14, was sent to Sherborne School, Dorset. There he was a school prefect, played football for his house, and was commissioned as a cadet officer in the Junior Division of the Officers' Training Corps. Muspratt began to learn to fly while still at school, mainly during the holidays, attending the Ruffy-Baumann School of Flying at Hendon Aerodrome from mid-1915. He was awarded his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate (No. 2789) on 27 April 1916. =Military service= Muspratt left school at the end of the 1916 summer term, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment for service in the Royal Flying Corps on 8 August 1916. On 2 November he was appointed a flying officer. Muspratt first served as a flying instructor and in a testing squadron, before joining No. 56 Squadron in France in May 1917. During his service he was credited with eight aerial victories (one captured, four destroyed, and three (two shared) 'out of control'). His first claim was flying Sopwith-built SE.5 No. A4861, against an Albatros D.III that he helped to force down out of control on 24 May 1917. He added a second out-of-control victory on the 28th, while flying SE.5 No. A8913. On 17 July, he shared another out-of-control victory flying A8913. He switched to SE.5 No. 8944, and scored decisively three times in August. Then, on 23 September, he participated in one of the epic air battles of World War I when Werner Voss single-handedly fought patrols from No. 60 Squadron, and \\"B\\" Flight of No. 56 Squadron, included Muspratt. During the battle, Voss damaged two No. 60 squadron aircraft such that they withdrew from the fight. He also holed the radiator of Muspratt's aircraft and riddled the wings of another 56 Squadron aircraft. Voss finally succumbed to bullets from Arthur Rhys Davids. Muspratt was awarded the Military Cross on 18 October 1917, and destroyed had two more German aircraft by the end of the month. After his final victory, he was withdrawn from battle and assigned to Home Establishment to serve as a test pilot at Martlesham Heath. Muspratt was promoted to lieutenant on 8 February 1918, and appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain on 11 February. He was killed in a flying accident in Suffolk on 16 March 1918, and is buried at Bournemouth Cemetery on Wimborne Road.

Armenia has an embassy in Copenhagen, and Denmark is represented in Armenia, through its embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. Diplomatic relations were established on 14 January 1992. The current Armenian Ambassador to Denmark is Hrachya Aghajanyan. In 2008, the Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan called the relations between Armenia and Denmark \\"friendly\\" and \\"highly appreciating\\". In 2013 Amstream was founded as an independent non- political and non-profit organization in order to initiate means of collaboration and partnerships between Armenia and Scandinavia within business, education and culture. History Embassy of Armenia in Copenhagen Mercantile relations between Armenia and Denmark date back to 1568, when Armenian traveler and writer Pirzade Ghap'anets'i visited Denmark. =1800s= During the Hamidian massacres against the Armenian civilians, the government of Denmark condemned the massacres, and sharply protested against the Ottoman Empire. The famous Danish scholar and critic Georg Brandes commented on the massacres and wrote a book about the Armenians in 1903. =1900s= Danish missionaries were active in Armenia from at least the 19th century. According to Danish historian Matthias Bjornlund, missionary, Karen Jeppe can be counted as Denmark's first ever aid worker. This was because she largely refrained from preaching Protestant doctrine to the Orthodox Armenians, instead concentrating on achieving humanitarian development objectives, such as improving education and performing rescue operations to free captured Armenian women. Unusually for European workers at the time, in the years leading up to World War I Jeppe along with other Danish individuals and organisations also pushed for international recognition of Armenians right to self determination. Armenia was granted independence shortly after World War I at the Treaty of Sèvres. However the new state, Wilsonian Armenia, was not officially recognised by Turkey or the USA, as President Woodrow Wilson, weakened by a stroke and without his political fixer Colonel House, was defeated in the Senate by the power plays of Henry Cabot Lodge. By 1921 the temporary Armenian republic had collapsed under military pressure from the Young Turks. Jeppe and other Danes returned from Denmark to the region to continue their work on behalf of the Armenians. Their work included the establishment of the first- ever Armenian agricultural village in Syria to provide a livelihood for displaced Armenians, settlements established by Jeppe and her helpers were noted for their prosperity in comparison to other camps that took in Armenians. In November 1920, Denmark accepted the League of Nations offer to act as a mediator in the war between the Democratic Republic of Armenia and the Turkish nationalists under Mustafa Kemal. After the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, Denmark donated aid to Armenia. =Modern Armenia= Since the modern state of Armenia gained independence in 1991, the two countries have worked to build ties, with both government and NGOs playing a role. According to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, civil society agencies such as Mission Ost, the Danish Armenian Mission and the Danish Society for the Caucasus Research have been active in developing the bilateral relationship. In 2003, 100 illegal Armenian immigrants lived in Denmark, and was a subject for return to Armenia, in the negotiations between the two governments. In 2004, Armenia's President Robert Kocharyan discussed the developing relationship with the Danish Ambassador, conceding much work remained to be done. Both parties emphasised the importance of enhanced economic cooperation. In a 2009 diplomatic meeting with Denmark's new ambassador, Armenia's President Serzh Sargsyan expressed a desire to further deepen their bilateral relationship, suggesting specific areas for increased cooperation such as agricultural and energy efficiency, where Denmark has considerable expertise. Both countries signed a double tax agreement to strengthen economic relations. Both countries signed an air service agreement in 2000. Armenia and Denmark signed a Readmission of persons with unauthorized stay agreement in April 2003. Armenian Genocide Sources from various Danish workers active in Armenia during the early twentieth century have been used by Matthias Bjornlund to offer new perspectives on the Armenian Genocide. The Danish government does not however officially recognise that the mass killings of Armenians should be classed as a Genocide, saying the judgement of whether to do so is a matter for historians. In an open letter by the \\"Danish Department for Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the denial and relativization of the Armenian genocide\\", historians Torben Jorgensen and Matthias Bjornlund wrote: \\"When it comes to the historical reality of the Armenian genocide, there is no \\"Armenian\\" or \\"Turkish\\" side of the \\"question\\", any more than there is a \\"Jewish\\" or a \\"German\\" side of the historical reality of the Holocaust: There is a scientific side, and an unscientific side acknowledgment or denial. In the case of the denial of the Armenian genocide, it is even founded on a massive effort of falsification, distortion, cleansing of archives, and direct threats initiated or supported by the Turkish state, making any \\"dialogue\\" with Turkish deniers highly problematic.\\" Development In the second phase of the Neighborhood Program, Armenia has a high priority. The Neighborhood Program helps Armenia with rural and economic development. In 2004, Denmark signed an agreement to assist Armenia implementing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) protocol and help reduce their emission of greenhouse gasses. The agreement came into force in March 2005. In 2006, Denmark assisted Armenia with 10 million DKK, for the disabled Armenian children. Denmark sent observers through the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to Armenia in 2007, and provided 16 million DKK to Armenia's renewable energy project. Denmark also sent aid to Armenia after the humanitarian consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 2008, the two countries signed an agreement, promoting growth and employment in poor areas. Denmark provided 30 million DKK to the project, and 29 million DKK to the private sector and education. In September 2008, Denmark assisted Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine with 50 million DKK, for the private sector programme. In June 2011, Denmark assisted Armenia with 4,7 million DKK to a programme of International Fund for Agricultural Development for the farms in Armenia. Trade Danish exports to Armenia in 2008 was 30.6 million DKK, while Denmark's import from Armenia, was 5 million DKK. High level visits In April 2003, Armenian Minister of Territorial Administration Hovik Abrahamyan visited Denmark. In August 2004, Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Per Stig Møller visited Armenia. In 2005, Denmark invited Armenian President Robert Kocharyan to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 51st annual session in Copenhagen, but refused because Denmark also invited Turkish Premier Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On 24 November 2011, the Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan visited Denmark for a meeting with the Danish Foreign Minister Villy Søvndal. Nalbandyan also thanked Denmark for the Danish assistance for the aftermath in the Spitak earthquake and in Armenia's progress since independence. Nalbandyan attended the opening of the new Armenian embassy in Denmark and stressed that: \\"Raising the Armenian flag in the capital of Denmark, we demonstrate our willingness to raise our bilateral relations to a new level.\\" See also * Armenians in Denmark * Mission East * Armenia–EU relations References Further reading  Denmark Category:Bilateral relations of Denmark ","title":"Armenia–Denmark relations"},{"id":"20026714","text":"The relations between Armenia and Japan were officially established on 7 September 1992.

Arianne Burnette, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Early Life & Influence Frederick Bridell was the third child, and only son, of John Bridle, carpenter, and Amelia (formerly Bartlett), living in Houndwell. He received basic schooling and left at an early age in order to earn a living. We learn from Henry Rose, that he was drawing avidly and ‘writing verse’ from the age of nine. Rose, in two letters to the Southampton Times in 1888, provided detail of Bridell’s early years and his subsequent apprenticeship to a picture restorer, Edwin Holder. At the age of eighteen years, William Bridle, had taken up portrait painting and was signing his work, Frederick Lee Bridell. One of the earliest portraits (Southampton Art Gallery coll.) was of Henry Rose, and this was shown to Edwin Holder who recognised his talent. Bridell took up residence with Holder’s family near Bray in Berkshire.Census 1851 From here he submitted his first work to the Royal Academy in 1851 entitled A Bit in Berkshire. Two years later he went to the Continent. After a short period in Paris, where he copied works in the Louvre, he established himself in Munich. Here he became influenced by the Dutch school, copying works by Cuyp, Van der Velde and Berchem. He was inspired by the mountainous landscape of the Tyrol, and its wooded valleys. Returning to England in 1855, he completed works from his sketches abroad and completed numerous commissions for the well-to-do of Southampton. He began to exhibit at the Royal Academy, the British Institution and the Liverpool Academy. Within two years, the artist had acquired a patron, James Wolff, a shipping magnate of Bevois Mount. Wolff established a Bridell gallery at his home and allowed visitors to view the paintings. Bridell set up his studio at Highfield Lodge and began a large work The Temple of Venus (90x60ins). The essence of Bridell’s work is the depiction of vastness in nature, large areas of landscape within which light moves through the scene, highlighting form and shadow. In his subjects, Bridell was much influenced by Turner, but he remained true to his own style. The Temple of Venus, Bridell hoped would one day hang between the Turners and Claudes in the National Gallery. The present location of this work is unknown, last appearing at auction in 1913. Italian Period Tudor House, Southampton Freed from financial constraint, Bridell was able to travel to Italy in the autumn of 1858. He set up a studio in Rome, near the Spanish Steps, in December of that year. There are entertaining descriptions of life in the city at this time, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Both he and his wife were interested in the culture and art and wrote details of their visits in French and Italian Notebooks. In Rome in 1859, Bridell met and married Eliza Fox, an artist, and the daughter of an MP, William Johnson Fox. She was known to influential writers and thinkers of the time, and Robert Browning, ‘gave her away’ at the ceremony. The newly wedded couple had their ‘wedding dinner’ at the Browning’s apartment in Bocca di Leone. Two days later they were both painting at their respective studios. Bridell, freed from the deprivation of his early years, embarked on his most prolific period. In Italy, he completed monumental works inspired by the landscape near Rome. It was however, in the vicinity of the Italian Lakes that he was most inspired to paint. Driven by his all consuming desire to record the grand vistas before him, he ignored the illness that was taking hold of his body. Returning to England in 1863, he died in Kensington in August of that year and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. He was outlived by both parents and a sister. The following year, possibly for financial reasons, Wolff sent his Bridell Gallery to Christie’s.

It is notable as the first Soviet film that explicitly challenges American stereotypes about Soviet Russia. Plot A broad satire of American ignorance of the Soviet Union, the film centers on the misadventures of the naive American, Mr. John West, played by Porfiri Podobed as a Harold Lloyd type (complete with enormous round glasses). West is a YMCA president from the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville, Ohio who is planning a trip to the newly founded USSR to spread the idea of the YMCA. His wife, Madge, is worried that Russia is full of savage Bolsheviks who wear primitive rags and fur for clothing, as depicted in American magazines. He takes along his cowboy friend Jeddie played by Boris Barnet for protection and as a companion. However, on arriving in the USSR his briefcase is stolen, he gets separated from Jeddie and he falls into the hands of a group of thieves, including a run-down Countess (played by Aleksandra Khokhlova), who masquerade as counter-revolutionaries. The thieves play on West's fears and engineer his abduction by crooks dressed up as caricature Bolshevik \\"barbarians.\\" The thieves then \\"rescue\\" West from the clutches of these fictional Bolsheviks, extorting thousands of dollars from him along the way. In the end, it is the real Bolshevik police who rescue West, rather than his friend Jeddie (who meanwhile has hooked up with an American girl living in Moscow). West then takes a sightseeing tour of Moscow, where he sees that the Soviet government did not destroy all cultural landmarks, such as Moscow University and the Bolshoi Theater, as the thieves suggested. The film culminates in Mr. West watching a military parade with the policeman and concluding that the American view of the Soviet Union is wrong. He telegraphs his wife instructing her to hang a portrait of Lenin in his study.

At first, it was frowned upon due to blue laws, but then cities like Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati decided to legalize them. Other cities such as New York City and Philadelphia had intense political and court battles to legalize the games. Nowadays, it is normal for baseball to be played on Sundays in the United States. Origins Due to blue laws, it was considered offensive to work on Sunday, which was expected to be a day of worship and rest. In 1794, the Pennsylvania Assembly restricted activities on Sunday by passing what they called \\"an Act for the prevention of vice and immorality, and of unlawful gaming, and to restrain disorderly sports and dissipation\\". Baseball In 1902, Sunday baseball games were legalized in Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. In 1907, New York City Democrats introduced two bills in Albany, New York that attempted to legalize Sunday baseball. State Assemblyman Al Smith spoke out against the ban of Sunday Baseball arguing that it was better for young men to be playing baseball than to \\"be driven to places where they play Waltz Me Around Again, Willie.\\" However, both bills were unsuccessful. In 1911, Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack expressed a desire for the Athletics to play on Sunday. The main driving force behind his interest in playing on Sunday was to earn money. The Athletics were not a wealthy baseball club, and Athletics vice-president John Shibe estimated that the team would make $20,000 for each Sunday game that they played in Philadelphia. Mack thought that, for the team, it was financially necessary to play on Sundays, explaining that \\"we [the Athletics] cannot meet our payrolls playing on seventy-seven weekdays at home\\". Many Pennsylvania politicians and religious groups opposed Shibe and Mack's effort for Sunday baseball, claiming that playing on that day was a \\"breach of peace\\" and that the games would be \\"a disturbance to persons in that neighborhood desirous of preserving the peace and quiet of Sunday so that they may in such peace and quiet pursue their religious worship and meditation\\". Unfortunately for the Athletics, Philadelphia's other baseball team, the Phillies, took no public position on the subject, undermining the Athletics' case. In 1917, the New York Giants and Cincinnati Reds played the first Sunday game ever at the Polo Grounds, New York's home field. However, after the game both managers, John McGraw and Christy Mathewson, were arrested for violating the blue laws. Judge Francis Xavier McQuade found them not guilty. The following year, Sunday baseball was legalized in Cleveland, Washington, D.C., and Detroit. One year after that, New York legalized baseball games on Sunday, and baseball teams that played in New York (the New York Giants, the New York Yankees, and the Brooklyn Dodgers) were allowed to have home games on Sunday. =The Athletics fight for Sunday baseball= In 1926, the Philadelphia Athletics were selected to host the Sesquicentennial Exposition to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of American Independence. The Exposition was running a deficit so the Board of Directors voted to open on Sundays and charge an admission fee. A few days later, the Athletics announced that they would play a game on August 22, 1926 against the Chicago White Sox. Officials for the Athletics felt that there was no difference between charging people admission for Exposition amusements on Sunday, and charging a fee for a baseball game. Philadelphia mayor W. Freeland Kendrick objected to the Athletics' decision and announced that he would use police to keep Shibe Park closed. The Athletics went to court to request that Kendrick's decision be overturned. Judge Frank Smith granted the A's request and ruled on Saturday, August 21, 1926 that those seeking to prohibit Sunday baseball could only do so if \\"their right to quiet and undisturbed religious worship is encroached upon as a result of the game\\". Smith's ruling also declared that to prove the game had created \\"a breach of peace\\", the game first had to be played, so the earliest legal action that could take place would be on the following Monday. 12,000 spectators attended the game, where the Athletics defeated the White Sox 3-2. During the game, Rev. William B. Forney drove around the park multiple times, and said that he was \\"ashamed that such an exhibition could be held on the Sabbath\\", and called the cheers from the crowd a \\"disgusting noise\\". Athletics manager Connie Mack was glad that baseball was played on Sunday, and was quoted as saying \\"I am glad that we won, of course, but I am more than glad that nothing happened that could be construed as a breach of the peace… I wish all those who oppose Sunday baseball could have been here today. They would see that we are not causing a lessening in church attendance.\\" Mayor Kendrick said that although the crowd for Sunday's game was \\"unusually subdued\\", he thought that any Sunday game was a breach of peace and the law. He also announced that the city of Philadelphia would seek a higher court to overturn Judge Smith's ruling. Connie Mack quickly announced that scheduling difficulties would prevent any more Sunday games in 1926. Even owner John Shibe told fans that \\"we are not going out of our way to play Sunday games... As there are no open Sundays left we shall probably leave things as they are until next season.\\" The City of Philadelphia took the case to Dauphin County Court, were the court decided the baseball being played on Sunday was unlawful \\"worldly employment\\". The Athletics then announced that they would take their case to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, who ruled in September 1927, by a vote of 7 to 2, the Sunday Baseball was both \\"unholy\\" and \\"worldly employment\\". The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also threatened the Athletics, saying that if the A's continued to play on Sunday, their club corporation franchise would be revoked. After this ruling, Athletics attorney announced that although the Athletics were going to drop their appeal, they did not plan on giving up. In 1931, a bill to liberalize the Blue Sunday Laws was introduced by supporters in the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The bill was passed by the house 106-98, but was soundly defeated by the State Senate. This caused A's attorney Gartling to announce plans to build a 50,000 seat stadium in Camden, New Jersey and move the team if Sunday restrictions were not eliminated. A public outcry ensued, which caused owner Shibe to quickly say that the plan was only visionary. In 1933, the House and Senate of Pennsylvania finally passed a bill that allowed local jurisdictions to vote on whether Sunday sports would be legalized in their area. When Philadelphia voted on the proposal, they easily won the right to play sports on Sunday. However, the A's had already sold many of their star players (including Al Simmons, Mickey Cochrane, and Lefty Grove) to pay for team finances, and in 1954 the A's moved to Kansas City, Missouri. The bill also didn't help the Philadelphia Phillies, who were struggling financially, until the team was bought by owner R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr., who was able to fix the Phillies' financial situation. Present time Once the last of the blue laws preventing Sunday baseball were gone, most teams scheduled Sunday games regularly. In the 1950s and 1960s, most teams frequently scheduled doubleheaders on Sunday to maximize attendance.\\"Larry Stone, Doubleheaders Are Passe\\", Baseball Digest, Nov. 2000 Although rising attendance has led to the elimination of regularly scheduled doubleheaders (with rare exceptions), Major League Baseball still schedules a full slate of games for each Sunday during the season, including Sunday night games televised by ESPN. Minor leagues play regularly on Sunday as well.

Toponymy The name Mangengenge derives from the Lingala word kongenge, which means \\"shining\\". The mountain was first called Mabangu or Manguele. History In June 1885. , the medical doctor Carl Anton Mense (1861–1938) was the first European to climb the mountain. To remember this historical ascent, the mountain was called \\"pic Mense\\" for almost a century. Geography Overlooking the plain of the Pool Malebo, it reaches an altitude of , which makes it the highest point in Kinshasa. Religion The path of the ascent is punctuated with crucifix sculptures with a large cross at the summit. This is because the Bishop of Kinshasa, Frederic Etsou Nzabi Bamungwabi took the initiative in 1992 to make it a spiritual place. Since then, thousands and thousands of pilgrims have climbed the peak. Tourism Being the highest point of Kinshasa and a rather beautiful and natural site, the mountain is also a significant tourist spot. There are about 100 foreign tourists ascending it every single month, all year round.

In practice the upper voltage output is limited to the voltage rating of components used. It is essentially a boost (step-up) converter followed by a buck (step-down) converter. The topology and use of MOSFETs make it inherently bi-directional which lends itself to applications requiring regenerative braking. The split-pi converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter that has an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is a switched-mode power supply with a similar circuit topology to a boost converter followed by a buck converter. Split-pi gets its name from the pi circuit due to the use of two pi filters in series and split with the switching MOSFET bridges. Other DC–DC converter topologies that can produce output voltage magnitude either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude include the boost-buck converter topologies (the split-pi, the Ćuk converter, the SEPIC, etc.) and the buck–boost converter topologies. Principle of operation In typical operation where a source voltage is located at the left-hand side input terminals, the left-hand bridge operates as a boost converter and the right- hand bridge operates as a buck converter. In regenerative mode, the reverse is true with the left-hand bridge operating as a buck converter and the right as the boost converter. Only one bridge switches at any time to provide voltage conversion, with the unswitched bridge's top switch always switched on. A straight through 1:1 voltage output is achieved with the top switch of each bridge switch on and the bottom switches off. The output voltage is adjustable based on the duty cycle of the switching MOSFET bridge.

Whereas the SVM classifier supports binary classification, multiclass classification and regression, the structured SVM allows training of a classifier for general structured output labels. As an example, a sample instance might be a natural language sentence, and the output label is an annotated parse tree. Training a classifier consists of showing pairs of correct sample and output label pairs. After training, the structured SVM model allows one to predict for new sample instances the corresponding output label; that is, given a natural language sentence, the classifier can produce the most likely parse tree. Training For a set of \\\\ell training instances (\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y}, n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell from a sample space \\\\mathcal{X} and label space \\\\mathcal{Y}, the structured SVM minimizes the following regularized risk function. :\\\\underset{\\\\boldsymbol{w}}{\\\\min} \\\\quad boldsymbol{w}\\\\^2 + C \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\underset{y\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Y}}{\\\\max} \\\\left(0, \\\\Delta(y_n,y) + \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y)\\\\rangle - \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n)\\\\rangle\\\\right) The function is convex in \\\\boldsymbol{w} because the maximum of a set of affine functions is convex. The function \\\\Delta: \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}_+ measures a distance in label space and is an arbitrary function (not necessarily a metric) satisfying \\\\Delta(y,z) \\\\geq 0 and \\\\Delta(y,y)=0 \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall y,z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}. The function \\\\Psi: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^d is a feature function, extracting some feature vector from a given sample and label. The design of this function depends very much on the application. Because the regularized risk function above is non- differentiable, it is often reformulated in terms of a quadratic program by introducing one slack variable \\\\xi_n for each sample, each representing the value of the maximum. The standard structured SVM primal formulation is given as follows. :\\\\begin{array}{cl} \\\\underset{\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi}}{\\\\min} & boldsymbol{w}\\\\^2 + C \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\ell} \\\\xi_n\\\\ \\\\textrm{s.t.} & \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w}, \\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n)\\\\rangle - \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w}, \\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y)\\\\rangle + \\\\xi_n \\\\geq \\\\Delta(y_n,y),\\\\qquad n=1,\\\\dots,\\\\ell,\\\\quad \\\\forall y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\end{array} Inference At test time, only a sample \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} is known, and a prediction function f: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} maps it to a predicted label from the label space \\\\mathcal{Y}. For structured SVMs, given the vector \\\\boldsymbol{w} obtained from training, the prediction function is the following. :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\\\underset{y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}}{\\\\textrm{argmax}} \\\\quad \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},y)\\\\rangle Therefore, the maximizer over the label space is the predicted label. Solving for this maximizer is the so-called inference problem and similar to making a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) prediction in probabilistic models. Depending on the structure of the function \\\\Psi, solving for the maximizer can be a hard problem.  Separation  The above quadratic program involves a very large, possibly infinite number of linear inequality constraints. In general, the number of inequalities is too large to be optimized over explicitly. Instead the problem is solved by using delayed constraint generation where only a finite and small subset of the constraints is used. Optimizing over a subset of the constraints enlarges the feasible set and will yield a solution which provides a lower bound on the objective. To test whether the solution \\\\boldsymbol{w} violates constraints of the complete set inequalities, a separation problem needs to be solved. As the inequalities decompose over the samples, for each sample (\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n) the following problem needs to be solved. :y_n^* = \\\\underset{y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}}{\\\\textrm{argmax}} \\\\left( \\\\Delta(y_n,y) + \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y)\\\\rangle - \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n)\\\\rangle - \\\\xi_n\\\\right) The right hand side objective to be maximized is composed of the constant -\\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n)\\\\rangle - \\\\xi_n and a term dependent on the variables optimized over, namely \\\\Delta(y_n,y) + \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y)\\\\rangle. If the achieved right hand side objective is smaller or equal to zero, no violated constraints for this sample exist. If it is strictly larger than zero, the most violated constraint with respect to this sample has been identified. The problem is enlarged by this constraint and resolved. The process continues until no violated inequalities can be identified. If the constants are dropped from the above problem, we obtain the following problem to be solved. :y_n^* = \\\\underset{y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}}{\\\\textrm{argmax}} \\\\left(\\\\Delta(y_n,y) + \\\\langle\\\\boldsymbol{w},\\\\Psi(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y)\\\\rangle\\\\right) This problem looks very similar to the inference problem. The only difference is the addition of the term \\\\Delta(y_n,y). Most often, it is chosen such that it has a natural decomposition in label space. In that case, the influence of \\\\Delta can be encoded into the inference problem and solving for the most violating constraint is equivalent to solving the inference problem.

St. Louis: The Sporting News, 1952, p. 172 was an American professional baseball player, a pitcher who appeared in 74 games pitched in Major League Baseball for three different teams between the 1947 and 1952 seasons. Listed at , , he batted and threw left-handed. The native of Topeka, Kansas, served in World War II in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations, where he was a tank commander. Johnson was a hard-throwing pitcher but what he lacked in control he made up for in the velocity and movement of his pitches. His wildness impeded his career, though he had flashes of brilliance. Johnson entered the Majors in 1947 with the St. Louis Cardinals, playing for them in part of four seasons (1947–50) before joining the Philadelphia Phillies (1950–51) and Detroit Tigers (1952). In his first major league start, he pitched a one-hitter for the Cardinals against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field (September 27). He struggled with his control after that and was sent by St. Louis to the Phillies in exchange for outfielder Johnny Blatnik. He went 4–1 as a member of the famous Phillies Whiz Kids, on the way to the National League pennant. Although he did not pitch in the 1950 World Series, Johnson appeared as a pinch runner for Dick Sisler in the ninth inning of Game 4, and scored the Phils' last run of the Fall Classic on an error by New York Yankees leftfielder Gene Woodling. New York won that game, 5–2, and the Series, four games to none. Johnson also pitched in nine games for Detroit in 1952, his last Major League season. In a six-season career, Johnson posted a 12–14 record with a 4.58 ERA in 74 appearances, including 34 starts, eight complete games, four shutouts, 147 strikeouts, 195 bases on balls, and a 1.32 walk-to-strikeout ratio in 269 innings of work. Johnson died in Wichita, Kansas, at the age of 81.

The group featured several members of SNFU and one from Jr. Gone Wild. They released their only album, Redeemer, in 1996, before disbanding two years later.  History  =Early years (1990–1992)= Late in 1989, guitarists and twin brothers Marc and Brent Belke disbanded their influential skate punk band SNFU due to a growing rift with singer Ken Chinn and their desire to experiment with playing different kinds of music.Open Your Mouth and Say...Mr. Chi Pig, Film, Dir: Sean Patrick Shaul, 2010.Chris Walter. ...What No One Else Wanted to Say. Vancouver: GFY Press, 2014 (second edition), 103. Several months later, the brothers formed the new band The Ship of Fools with SNFU bassist Curtis Creager and longtime acquaintance Dave Rees playing drums. With Marc Belke acting as lead vocalist, the band departed from the punk sound of SNFU by playing melodic alternative rock. After their initial string of performances, they renamed themselves the Wheat Chiefs. The members later remembered the early Wheat Chiefs songs as \\"kinda lengthy.\\" Walter 108 Bassist Trent Buhler, a former member of Rees's group Broken Smiles, replaced Creager early in 1990. The group recorded a demo cassette to pitch to record industry representatives and embarked on several Canadian tours.Walter 109 Their track \\"Redeem\\" was included on Thrasher Skate Rock Volume 10, issued by Thrasher magazine in 1991. The Belkes reformed SNFU in September 1991, while Rees and Buhler departed the Wheat Chiefs early in 1992 to form the new band Cowboy Dick.Walter 119 =New lineup (1992–1996)= Despite the reformation of SNFU, the Belkes kept the Wheat Chiefs active. Drummer Ed Dobek (of Jr. Gone Wild and the pre-SNFU band Live Sex Shows) and bassist Rob Johnson (a former Wheat Chiefs roadie and future SNFU member) completed the new lineup. This incarnation debuted with a short tour, and recorded several new tracks with producers Marek Forysinski and Dave Ogilvie.Walter 129 Brent Belke later remembered the new Wheat Chiefs material as \\"quicker and more straight ahead; it was great.\\"Walter 119 The band was active sporadically in the time that followed, with a major run of touring coming in 1993.Walter 138 Later this year, the band recorded the track \\"Joe Murphy\\" (named for the professional ice hockey player of the same name) with Ogilvie and returning guest drummer Rees, now a member of SNFU. The track was included on the Puck Rock Volume 1 compilation, a full disc of hockey-related punk rock songs assembled by John Wright of The Hanson Brothers and NoMeansNo. The Wheat Chiefs received a seven-figure recording contract offer from Mercury Records, but rejected this in anticipation of a better deal, which they never received.Walter 127 Early in 1994, the group re-recorded two songs from their demo cassette, again with Rees returning as a guest. Now signed to Epitaph Records, SNFU remained heavily active over the next two years while Wheat Chiefs activity lessened. =Redeemer and breakup (1996–1998)= After spending two years focusing mainly on SNFU, Johnson and the Belkes returned to full-time Wheat Chiefs rehearsals early in 1996. Culled from three recording sessions held in 1992 and 1994, the Redeemer album was released later this year through BangOn Records, a subsidiary of the Canadian Cargo Records imprint.Discorder Magazine, September 1996, pp. 21 They promoted the album with tours of Canada and the United States, the largest in the band's career.Walter 170 In 1997, drummer Dan Moyse replaced Dobek.Walter 177 The Wheat Chiefs continued to perform sporadically, but the members' careers were dealt a blow late that year when SNFU's contract with Epitaph expired. The Wheat Chiefs ultimately disbanded following Brent Belke's decision to quit both bands and pursue work in music composition for film and television. They played a final gig on March 28, 1998 at a festival in Edmonton.Walter 170 Members *Marc Belke – vocals, guitar (1990–1998) *Brent Belke – guitar, vocals (1990–1998) *Curtis Creager – bass (1990) *Dave Rees – drums (1990–1992, 1994) *Trent Buhler – bass, vocals (1990–1992) *Rob Johnson – bass, vocals (1992–1998) *Ed Dobek – drums (1992–1997) *Dan Moyse – drums (1997–1998) ;Timeline ImageSize = width:620 height:200 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1990 till:03/28/1998 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitars value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Releases id:bars value:gray(0.92) Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:2 BackgroundColors = bars:bars ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:01/01/1990 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1990 LineData = at:07/01/1996 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Marc text:\\"Marc Belke\\" bar:Brent text:\\"Brent Belke\\" bar:Creager text:\\"Curtis Creager\\" bar:Buhler text:\\"Trent Buhler\\" bar:Johnson text:\\"Rob Johnson\\" bar:Rees text:\\"Dave Rees\\" bar:Dobek text:\\"Ed Dobek\\" bar:Moyse text:\\"Dan Moyse\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Marc from:01/01/1990 till:end color:Vocals bar:Brent from:01/01/1990 till:end color:Guitars bar:Creager from:01/01/1990 till:05/01/1990 color:Bass bar:Buhler from:05/01/1990 till:02/01/1992 color:Bass bar:Johnson from:02/01/1992 till:end color:Bass bar:Rees from:01/01/1990 till:02/01/1992 color:Drums bar:Dobek from:02/01/1992 till:02/01/1997 color:Drums bar:Rees from:02/01/1994 till:03/01/1994 color:Drums bar:Moyse from:02/01/1997 till:end color:Drums width:3 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Marc from:01/01/1990 till:end color:Guitars bar:Brent from:01/01/1990 till:end color:Vocals bar:Buhler from:05/01/1990 till:02/01/1992 color:Vocals bar:Johnson from:02/01/1992 till:end color:Vocals Discography Albums *Redeemer (1996, BangOn Records/Hom Wreckerds Music) Demo cassettes *Wheat Chiefs (1991, self-released) Compilation appearances *Thrasher Skate Rock Volume 10 (1991) *Puck Rock Volume 1 (1993, Wrong Records) *Edmonton Rocks Volume 1 (1997) References  External links  *Wheat Chiefs at CBC Radio3 Category:1990 establishments in Alberta Category:1998 disestablishments in British Columbia Category:Canadian punk rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 Category:Musical groups from Edmonton Category:Sibling musical groups ","title":"Wheat Chiefs"},{"id":"20027203","text":"Harland Stimson \\"Hypie\\" Rowe (April 20, 1896 – May 26, 1969), was an American professional baseball third baseman who played in with the Philadelphia Athletics of Major League Baseball.

The rich biodiversity of the wetland comprising aquatic, mesophytic and terrestrial flora and fauna including some important species of plants and animals was recognized internationally by the Ramsar Convention in 2002 by designating the Kanjli Lake in the List of Wetlands of International Importance.Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands (RIS) -- India, Kanjli, 2002 In this context, it is reported that the Punjab State which has 14 wetlands covering an area of 225.76 km2 (2% of the geographical area of the State) has the unique position of three of its wetlands viz., the Kanjli Wetland covering an area of 490 ha of which the Kanjli Lake water spread is 184 ha), the Harike Wetland (4100 ha) and the Ropar Wetland (1365 ha) chosen by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoE&F;), Government of India for their conservation and management are now also included in the Ramsar list covering a total area of 5650 ha; Kanjli is upstream of Harike wetland located in the Beas river basin while the Ropar wetland is in the Roopnagar district.and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its ConservationManagement of Lakes in India  Wetland  The Kanjli Wetland is one of the manmade wetlands in India identified by the Government of India, as per the Expert Group's (set up in 1983 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests) report published in 1990. Since the main article on Wetland does not cover the aspects of Indian wetlands, the work done in this regard in India is explained. The Expert Group has based its directory on the basis of the definition enunciated by the Ramsar International Convention on Wetlands: \\" areas of marsh, fen, peatland, or water whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres\\". Further, considering the definition of wetlands given by Cowden in 1979 for classification of wetlands in the US, three key attributes of hydrology (the degree of flooding or soil saturation), wetland vegetation (hydrophytes) and hydric soils have also been considered for identification. In this list, mangroves are not included since it falls under a separate category. The Expert Group's directory has made a distinction between Natural and Man-Made wetlands (including wetlands of less than 100 ha area). In India, in its 24 states and two union territories (as per the 1990 report), there are 2167 nos of natural wetlands with a total area of 1.45 million ha and Man-Made wetlands of 65,254 nos with total area of 2.59 million ha. The inland water bodies listed in the report covers lakes, tanks, reservoirs etc. Royal patronage The erstwhile Maharaja of Kapurthala (Raja Randhir Singh - 1862 to 1870), built the headworks on the river Kali Bein which resulted in the creation of the Kanjli Wetland which subsumes the sparkling lake by the same name. The Maharaja also built a retreat, in the French architectural style, in the forest set in lovely natural scenery, on the banks of the Lake, which was named \\"The Villa\\" or the \\"Villa Buona Vista\\". His royal successors live in this retreat even now. The lake has been developed as a tourist destination with facilities for fishing and boating. A traditional Mela or exhibition is held here during Depavali festival.Wetland, KapurtalaTourist Attractions Access The Kanjli ecological Wetland region around the village Kanjli is from the Kapurthala town, also the district headquarters, and is thus well connected by road network to all parts of the state and rest of the country.  Hydrology  The Kali Bein River, originating near village Dhanoa, upstream of Budho Bark Regulator in Hoshiarpur District, formerly a main tributary of the Beas River feeds the Wetland and the Lake. The Bien has now become an independent river due to siltation and westward swing of the Beas River. Agricultural development dominates the catchment of the wetland. The Bien river has contributed to the formation of fertile plains by bringing down large sediment loads during floods. Depth of water in the Lake has a seasonal variation of 3.05 m (10 feet) to 7.62 m (25 feet) depending on the season and inflow discharge. Catchment area is mainly under agriculture. The wetland is in the semi-arid zone and receives an average annual rainfall of about 620 mm. The temperature varies from a maximum of 450 C in summer to an average of 60C during winter with occasionally freezing temperatures. Wetlands of Punjab (Kanjli Wetland) The Kali Bein and its wetland provide water supply for agriculture in the Kapurthala district, recharges the ground water, drains excessive rainwater from sensitive crops like wheat, potato, etc. and acts as a sponge by absorbing the flood waters. , Inventory of Wetlands, Kanjli, p. 332-343  Water quality  The water and sludge quality of the Wetland has been studied by the Punjab Pollution Control Board Their report indicates that quality generally conforms to Class 'B' with some degree of quality degradation to Class 'D' sometimes during December. From a satellite imagery study of the wetland it has been inferred that Kanjli Lake could be categorised under low turbidity class (dark blue hue) during pre-monsoon period and moderate turbidity class (medium blue) during post monsoon season which is indicative of regimentation occurring in the lake during post monsoon season.Mapping and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its Conservation  Flora and fauna  The flora and fauna recorded in the Wetland and the Kanjli Lake within it (Some of them are pictured in the gallery) are the following. = Flora = * Twelve varieties of trees recorded in the wetland are Acacia arabica, Albizia lebbeck, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus hybrid, Ficus bengalensis, Mangifera indica, Melia azedarach, Morus alba, Prosopis juliflora, Syzygium cumini and Ziziphus mauritiana. * Shrubs recorded are: Calotropis procera, Ipomoea crassicaulis and Tamarix dioca * Herbs noted are Saccharum munja, Saccharum spontaneum, Scirpus sp. and other common herbs. =Aqua flora= 11 species of aquaflora, 34 species of zooplankton and 15 species of macro invertebrates have been reported. = Aqua fauna = According to the District Gazetteer and the study done by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), 17 fish species (in Bein river and the lake) have been reported which includes the common fish species of Catla catla, Channa marulius (great snakehead), Cythus striatus, Cirrhinus mrigala, Labeo calbasu and Labeo rohita. The tortoise is the common reptile reported in the area. There are twenty-eight resident bird species and nine migratory species. The migratory birds are various species of goose, white-eyed pochard, wigeon, tufted pochard, common teal, large whistling teal, pintail, mallard and shoveller. =Fauna= The mammals in the wetland are the Indian civet, mongoose, Indian porcupine, squirrel and common Indian hare.  Problems in the wetland  In the Wetland, the ecological status of the Kanjli lake, in particular, has been threatened on account of the following issues.Mapping and Monitoring of Natural Resources of Kanjli Wetland Ecosystem (Punjab) India-An Integrated Approach for its Conservation * Extensive growth of water hyacinth due nutrients and pesticides from adjoining agricultural fields * Anthropogenic pressure and consequent land encroachment * Eutrophication, particularly due to in-situ decay of hyacinth * Conversion of wetland for agriculture, human habitation, industrial expansion and recreational activities * Illegal and indiscriminate fishing causing disturbance to bird life  Conservation measures  The conservation and management measures undertaken with assistance provided by the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Govt. of India (MoEF, GOI) by the Environment Division of the Punjab State Council for Science & Technology under the directive of the State Level Steering Committee are the following. * Detailed mapping of the wetland for declaring and notifying the Kanjli Wetland as protected area under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. * Judicious hyacinth (weed) control by the irrigation department, district police, and even army units, by manual methods. Conveyor belt system as a mechanical method to clear the weeds is also being tried. * Hyacinth control through biological control by releasing two weevil species (which have proved been found effective worldwide and introduced in the downstream in the Harike Wetland Ecosystem) of Neochetina bruchi and N. eichorniae. Release of the moth Sameodes albiguittal is also being considered as an option. * Introduction of more fish species in the lake judiciously to avoid any adverse effects of exotic species. * Afforestation measures around the lake area and in the small islands, with mixed indigenous species of trees to prevent soil erosion resulting in siltation reduction in the lake, to attract large species of birds to nest and roost and to enhance the ecosystem. * Selective Fencing of the Wetland to prevent excessive grazing to preservation of important pockets provide habitat for wading birds and to check encroachments * Monitoring of water quality continuously to check the degree of external nutrient loading of the lake waters and to evolve appropriate preventive and curative steps * Public awareness campaigns through mass-media, educational material, camps, etc. of the wetland eco system with the help of Voluntary Organizations * Continued scientific research on Biological and hydrological components, and Productivity potential with respect of economic value, social aspects of heritage and to rate the significance of the wetland. * A team of five students from a local university have been in reclamation activities  Sikh tradition  Sikh tradition states that at the age of thirty, Nanak went missing and was presumed to have drowned after going for one of his morning baths to a local stream called the Kali Bein. Three days later he reappeared and would give the same answer to any question posed to him: \\"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\\" (in Punjabi, \\"nā kōi hindū nā kōi musalmān\\"). It was from this moment that Nanak would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of Sikhism.

He played college baseball for the University of Michigan and played Major League Baseball for the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics team that won the 1929 World Series and is considered one of the greatest baseball teams in history. He later practiced as an attorney in California and Nevada. In 1957, he was recognized by the Governor of Nevada for \\"exceptional acts of heroism\\" in disarming a gunman who had run amok in the Reno, Nevada veterans' hospital, killing two persons and injuring a third. Early years Morse was born in Berkeley, California. His father, Newell O. Morse, Sr., was a native of Maine who managed and later owned a stationery and book store in Berkeley.Census entry for Newell O. Morse and family.

At the time of the 1910 and 1920 United States Censuses, Morse was living in Berkeley with his parents, an older brother Paul, and a younger sister Helen. Morse enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1922. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity at Berkeley.The Blue and Gold Yearbook, 1924, pages 446 and 538.The Blue and Gold Yearbook, 1925, page 438. According to the university's 1924 and 1925 yearbooks, Morse played for the California Golden Bears baseball team coached by former major league pitcher Carl Zamloch. Morse was listed as a five-foot, nine inch, 143 pound left fielder.The Blue and Gold Yearbook, 1924, page 263.The Blue and Gold Yearbook, 1925, page 380. Morse transferred to the University of Michigan where he graduated in 1928 with a bachelor of science degree in education.1928 Michiganensian, page 119. and played for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He was a member of the Phi Epsilon Kappa National Honorary Physical Education Fraternity at Michigan.1928 Michiganensian, page 278. In 1956, Michigan's long-time baseball coach Ray Fisher selected his all-time Michigan baseball team and named Morse as one of two second basemen (along with Buck Giles). After leaving Michigan, returned to Berkeley to attend law school. He also played college baseball for Berkeley in 1929. He reportedly delayed his matriculation into Boalt Hall law school when he signed with the Philadelphia Athletics. Professional baseball In early June 1929, and just out of college, Morse was signed with the San Francisco Mission Reds of the Pacific Coast League. Although he had played second base in college, the Mission Reds signed Morse to replace their injured shortstop. The Sporting News reported: \\"He is said to have done a splendid job, considering his lack of experience.\\" Morse appeared in 21 games for the Missionaries and compiled a .250 batting average. On June 22, 1929, Morse was sold to the Des Moines Demons in the Western League. Morse played a few games at shortstop for the Demons, but was quickly shifted to his natural position at second base where, according to The Sporting News, \\"he immediately became a star.\\" He appeared in 76 games for the Demons and compiled a .302 batting average. On August 31, 1929, Morse was sold to Connie Mack's 1929 Philadelphia Athletics. The sale came about through the efforts of Des Moines team's president Lee Keyser. According to a press account, \\"Morse looked so big leaguish in his work at the keystone sack\\" that Keyser took a train to St. Louis when the Athletics were playing the St. Louis Browns. Keyser told Mack about Morse, and Mack acquired Morse on Keyser's recommendation without seeing Morse. The New York Yankees were also reported to be \\"keenly interested\\" in signing Morse, \\"but apparently the athletics outbid them.\\" Morse had the good fortune of joining a team that is considered \\"one of the greatest baseball teams ever assembled.\\" The 1929 Athletics included five Hall of Famers (Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, Eddie Collins, and Lefty Grove) and compiled a 104-46 record and defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 1929 World Series. Manager Connie Mack used Morse to relieve the team's regular second baseman Max Bishop.(\\"He gave neophyte infielder Newell 'Bud' Morse a line in the record books by using him in 8 games to rest Max Bishop . . .\\") Morse made his major league debut on September 14, 1929, and appeared in 8 games during the last two weeks of the regular season. He compiled an .074 batting average with two hits in 27 at- bats. In early October 1929, The Sporting News reported on Morse's progress: \\"Morse is fielding excellently and has won favor from Mack, but as yet the Californian has not found his batting stride.\\" After the 1929 season, the Athletics released Morse back to Des Moines. The Sporting News called him a \\"promising young player\\" and reported: \\"He proved a capital fielder, but was a little shy with the bat.\\" In 1930, Morse appeared in 13 games for the Dallas Steers (Texas League) and Minneapolis Millers (American Association). Family and later years After retiring from baseball, Morse returned to the University of California's Boalt Hall law school. After graduating from law school, he formed a law partnership with his brother Paul D. Morse. In February 1936, Morse married Berniece H. Wright at Carmel, California. They met in 1931 when both were employed as playground supervisors for the Berkeley Recreation Department. At the time of the marriage, Morse was an attorney in Oakland, California. Morse later worked as an attorney at the veteran's hospital in Reno, Nevada. In 1957, he gained attention when he disarmed a former security guard who had run amok in the hospital with a shotgun. The disgruntled former employee killed two hospital employees and shot a third person before Morse disarmed him \\"in a wild battle in a corridor.\\" The Reno Evening Gazette wrote: \\"He might have killed Harrison, but hospital attorney Newell Morse, 53, caught Eaton's revolver hand from behind. Two revolver shots hit the wall. Morse then hit Eaton with a right haymaker. Eaton went down. Harrison and Morse disarmed him and held him until the arrival of police. Policemen ... found Eaton battered and bloody, in the hand of Morse and Harrison.\\" One month later, Nevada Governor Charles H. Russell presented Morse a gold medal for \\"exceptional acts of heroism\\" in capturing and disarming the gunman. In 1987, Morse died in Sparks, Nevada at age 82.

For history of the period see World War I, World War II, etc.. The \\"Second Thirty Years' War\\" is a periodization scheme sometimes used to encompass the wars in Europe from 1914 to 1945. Just as the Thirty Years' War of 1618 to 1648 was not a single war but a series of conflicts in varied times and locations, later organized and named by historians into a single period, the Second Thirty Years' War has been seen as a \\"European Civil War\\", fought over the problem of Germany and exacerbated by the new ideologies of fascism, Nazism and communism that came into power after World War I. The thesis of the Second Thirty Years' War is that World War I naturally led to World War II; in this framework, the latter is the inevitable result of the former, and thus they can be seen as a single conflict. Historians have criticized this thesis on the grounds that it excuses the actions of fascist and Nazi historical actors.  Origins  The concept of a \\"Second Thirty Years' War\\" originated in 1946 with the former head of French government Charles de Gaulle in his speech in Bar-le-Duc (28 July 1946) evoking \\"the drama of the Thirty Years War we just won\\". De Gaulle viewed the First World War and the Second World War as a single conflict, the interwar period being a mere truce.Charles de Gaulle, Discours prononcé à Bar- le-Duc, 28 juillet 1946, http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/textes/degaulle28071946.htm That was echoed, among others, by Sigmund Neumann in his book The Future in Perspective (1946). In 1948, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave the idea a boost when, in the first paragraph of the preface to The Gathering Storm (1948), he wrote that his books would \\"cover an account of another Thirty Years War\\". Major European conflicts during that period included the Balkan Wars (1912–13), World War I (1914–18), the Russian Civil War (1917–23), the Ukrainian–Soviet War (1917–21), the Polish–Soviet War (1919–21), the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) and World War II (1939–45). In addition, the interwar period saw significant levels of civilian and labor conflict as well as colonial wars.  Criticism  The thesis has been challenged and rejected by many historians, who see it as too simple an explanation for the complex series of events that occurred during the interwar period of 1918 to 1939. In particular, some argue that, in describing the rise of the Nazis as an inevitable result of the treaty of Versailles, the \\"Second Thirty Years' War\\" thesis excuses Nazi rhetoric as being a defensive reaction to supposed British and French vindictiveness. Rather, critics see World War II as a consequence of Hitler and the racist ideology of Nazism, and since Hitler's rise to power was contingent on the Great Depression, it cannot have been inevitable, nor can his support have been a direct reaction to Versailles. The Second Thirty Years' War thesis is part of the larger debates over the causes of World War II and over the idea of a European Civil War.

The first manor house on the site, built above the Aqualate Mere in the 16th century by Thomas Skrymsher was rebuilt for Edwin Skrymsher (Member of Parliament for Stafford) in the 17th century just after he had completed nearby Forton Hall. The original building remained in much the same style until, Sir John Boughey bought the house in the late 18th century and in 1808 commissioned John Nash to rebuild it in the Gothic style. Sir Thomas Boughey developed the house, grounds and associated village in the 1830s. The building was destroyed by fire on 28 November 1910. The present house, which incorporates some elements of the 17th-century house and of Nash's Gothic successor, was built between 1927 and 1930 by W. D. Caröe. An original range of gables by Nash joins the new house to an 18th-century stable block. During World War II the house was used an evacuation home. The grounds were used as a military transport base run by the Auxiliary Territorial Service. The Nissen huts which they left behind were then used by the homeless until 1952. Etymology The name Aqualate is from Anglo-Saxon Āc-gelād, possibly in the sense \\"difficult passage over wet ground by the oak trees\\"; there is much wet and boggy ground in the area and a mere, although Eilert Ekwall suggests Old English Āc-gelãd meaning \\"oak stream\\". Architecture The square red brick building has clay tile roofs. It has a service wing on the east side. The north front has a two-storey polygonal porch, two projecting canted bays and is decorated with armorial shields and a carved head which used to be on a gatepost. In the grounds can be found stables, two Gothic lodge-houses, and a red brick house with an attached castellated tower. There is now no sign of the original formal gardens but the boundary of the deer park can still be identified. This contains plantations of oak trees.

They settled in an area about south of Chicago which they named \\"High Prairie,\\" now Roseland, Chicago. John Ton settled on farm land further south on the north bank of the Calumet River that was owned by the Dalton brothers, Charles and Henry. This land is now part of the Riverdale community. In 1853, he married Aggie Vander Syde, another Dutch immigrant, and began raising a family. In 1859, they purchased the land from the Daltons.Chicago Title & Trust Co.

Illinois was a hotbed having a southern border with slave states and leaders such as Abraham Lincoln advocating the abolition of slavery.

Jiang Gongfu's grandfather Jiang Shenyi (姜神翊) served as a prefectural prefect, but his father Jiang Ting (姜挺) was not listed with any official titles. He had at least one younger brother, Jiang Fu (姜復).New Book of Tang, vol. 73. After Jiang Gongfu passed the imperial examinations he was made Xiaoshulang (校書郎), an editor at the Palace Library. After he passed a special examination on policy proposals, he was made Zuo Shiyi (左拾遺), an advisor at the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng), and he was also made an imperial scholar at Hanlin Pavilion (翰林館). After more than a year, when he was to be given a different office, he submitted a petition, citing the poverty of his household and the agedness of his mother, requesting to be also made the census officer under the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the region of the capital Chang'an), because the census officer, while a low-level position, had a high salary, and his petition was granted. He was said to be capable and sensible, and whenever he met Emperor Dezong to make suggestions, Emperor Dezong often followed his suggestions.Old Book of Tang, vol. 138 . In 783, with Emperor Dezong waging wars against several warlords in the east, the soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), were at Chang'an to await deployment to the east. They were angered that they were not given rewards that they felt they deserved, and they mutinied. Emperor Dezong sent his son Li Yi (李誼) the Prince of PuLi Yi was actually Emperor Dezong's nephew — the son of Emperor Dezong's brother Li Miao (李邈), but was adopted by Emperor Dezong at the directions of Emperor Dezong. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 150 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. and Jiang to try to calm the soldiers, but the soldiers merely got angrier, and Emperor Dezong, in panic, decided to flee Chang'an. As he was ready to do so, Jiang tried to warn him about the dangers of leaving the senior general Zhu Ci in the city – as Emperor Dezong had removed Zhu Ci from his command in 782 due to his brother Zhu Tao's rebelling against imperial authorityZizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. – and had served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingyuan Circuit before, and therefore might receive the Jingyuan soldiers' support. He suggested to Emperor Dezong that either he should kill Zhu Ci before leaving or ask Zhu to accompany him. Emperor Dezong, in panic, could not carry out either action, and left Zhu in the city. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and Jiang followed him there.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. Emperor Dezong issued emergency edicts seeking aid from the nearby circuits. Meanwhile, the Jingyuan soldiers did as Jiang predicted and supported Zhu as their leader. Zhu initially claimed that he was merely calming the situation at Chang'an and was ready to welcome Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an, but soon there were rumors that Zhu was planning to claim imperial title himself and attack Emperor Dezong at Fengtian. In light of this, some officials who had fled to Fengtian suggested that Fengtian's defenses be shored up, but the chancellor Lu Qi, misjudging the situation, argued to Emperor Dezong that Zhu would surely remain faithful to Tang and advocated taking no precautions at all and stopping the incoming aid troops. It was only at Jiang's advice Emperor Dezong continued to receive the aid troops into Fengtian. At suggestion of Lu and Bai Zhizhen (白志貞) the commander of the imperial guards, Emperor Dezong sent his granduncle Wu Xu (吳漵) to Chang'an to communicate with Zhu. Zhu initially welcomed Wu as an honored imperial emissary, but soon put Wu to death. He declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin. He put Fengtian under siege, and during the siege, Emperor Dezong made Jiang Jianyi Daifu (諫議大夫), a high- level advisor at the examination bureau, and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. During chancellorship In 784, because the general Li Huaiguang also rebelled, Emperor Dezong fled further to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), and Jiang Gongfu accompanied him. On the way to Liang Prefecture, Emperor Dezong's oldest daughter Princess Tang'an died at Chenggu (城固, in modern Hanzhong). After Emperor Dezong reached Liang Prefecture, he wanted to build a pagoda for Princess Tang'an and bury her with great wealth.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230. Jiang submitted a petition stating: Emperor Dezong became angry and wanted to remove Jiang. Despite the intercession of Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor Lu Zhi, Emperor Dezong soon removed Jiang and made him a member of the staff of his crown prince Li Song. After chancellorship Jiang Gongfu's mother soon died, and he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for her. After the period of mourning, he was returned to Li Song's staff, but went a long time without being promoted. By 792, Lu Zhi was a chancellor. Because he and Lu Zhi were colleagues while they were imperial scholars, Jiang met Lu to request his help. Lu secretly responded:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. In fear, Jiang offered to resign and asked to become a Taoist monk. When Emperor Dezong inquired as to the reason and found out that he was fearful, he did not dare to state that Lu had told him this information, and instead claimed that Dou told him the information. Angry that his words had been leaked, Emperor Dezong demoted Jiang to be the secretary general of Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), and sent imperial eunuch messengers to Dou, in exile, to rebuke him. After Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by Li Song (as Emperor Shunzong), Jiang was slightly promoted, to be the prefect of Ji Prefecture (吉州, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). He soon died, and was posthumously honored by Emperor Shunzong's son and successor Emperor Xianzong (to whom Emperor Shunzong, then seriously ill, passed the throne to in 805 as well).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236.

They are also sometimes called \\"preparados\\" (meaning \\"prepared\\"). Licuados and other fresh fruit juice drinks are ubiquitous throughout Mexico. They are sold by street vendors, and in special licuado shops, restaurants, and fruterias (restaurants specializing in fresh fruit). Terminology and variations Licuados (\\"blendeds\\" or \\"liquifieds\\" in Spanish) are among a larger category of fruit drinks made with fruit juice diluted with milk or water: jugos (juice), vitaminas, aguas frescas (juice mixed with sugar and water), refrescos (nonalcoholic carbonated soft drinks), and batidos. Names for various types of shakes and smoothies vary regionally, and are not completely fixed. By contrast with aguas frescas, which are made in advance and ladled from large jars, and other drinks such as refrescos and jugos, which are typically mass-produced and bottled, licuados are blended and made to order. The main difference between a licuado and an American-style smoothie is that licuados use a milk base, whereas smoothies use fruit juice, sometimes in combination with sherbet or yogurt. This makes them lower in calories, thinner, and higher in protein than most smoothies, especially important in the third-world state of many of the Latin American countries such as Honduras and Nicaragua. Licuados may also contain nuts (such as almonds or walnuts) and sugar or honey. Variants include adding granola or using chocolate instead of fruit. Versions with raw egg fruit and milk ,Americanized version substitute fruit with milk flavorings such as (quik) . Sometimes batidos (loosely meaning \\"beaten\\") are said to have milk, with licuados described as a milk-free version. Term \\"batido\\" is described by some as Cuban. Different flavors of licuados or batidos have specific names, usually named after their ingredients. For example, a \\"trigo\\" (Spanish for \\"wheat\\") or \\"batido de trigo\\" is a batido with puffed wheat or other cooked grains blended in.. Popularity outside Latin America Licuados became popular in the United States in the 1990s during a period of immigration from Latin American countries. By 1996 the drink had arrived in New York City, where it was sold by street vendors. Already popular in border towns such as Tijuana (where they are a breakfast food) the drink spread to California, first among Mexican-Americans and at Mexican restaurants and food trucks. In 2002, the California Milk Processor Board spent $1.5 million to popularize the drink, as a way of promoting milk consumption following their success with the Got Milk? campaign. Equivalent drinks A similar drink, called ' in Vietnam, is popular in Southeast Asia.

It is used particularly on open grained woods such as oak, mahogany and walnut where building up multiple layers of standard wood finish is ineffective or impractical.  Composition  Grain fillers generally consist of three basic components; a binder, a bulking agent and a solvent. The binder is wood finish, and in the case of oil-based fillers is typically a blend of oil and varnish. In the case of water-based fillers, it is acrylic or urethane. The type of binder influences the type of solvent used; oil-based fillers usually use mineral spirits, while water-based fillers use water. Both types of filler use silica as a bulking agent as it resists shrinking and swelling in response to changes in temperature and humidity. Other binders may include quartz powder, wood flour, and talc.  Use  Woodworkers will use a grain filler before applying other finishes to open grained woods to achieve a \\"full finish\\", which is mirror-like. Woods such as ash, oak, mahogany and walnut fall into this category, while tight grained woods such as maple and cherry can achieve a full finish with just a few coats of finish. Before application, the surface is sanded and puttied to conceal surface imperfections, which would otherwise be made far more obvious by the grain filler. The filler is brushed on both with and against the wood grain and the excess is scraped off. After some drying, the woodworker typically uses a piece of burlap to remove more excess.

Built beginning in 1941 and completed in 1947 after a halt during World War II, somewhat after the heyday of these styles, it was a large 960-seat first-run theater until the 1980s. The theater was designed by B. Marcus Priteca, a leading designer of themed cinemas in America, in association with Seattle architect A.A. Porreca for Cap Lathrop, a prominent Alaska businessman. The theater's lobby featured a gold leaf mural of Mount McKinley, but originally omitted a concession stand, a feature Lathrop felt was inappropriate. The main house was decorated with silver and gold murals by Anthony Heinsbergen and Frank Bouman of Los Angeles, and a rendering of the Big Dipper (a symbol of Alaska) on the ceiling. Murals were done on canvas with reliefs in Masonite leafed with gold and silver. The building's structure is reinforced concrete with travertine on the exterior street level. Interior, Fourth Avenue Theatre As the Lathrop Building, the complex included facilities for Lathrop's radio and television stations, a restaurant, and a penthouse apartment added in 1959-1960. Mural in the theater After some renovation by the city of Anchorage, the theater was used by a catering firm as a banquet facility. Rasmuson Foundation approved a program related investment structured as a low-interest loan to the Municipality of Anchorage in 2006 so that the city could purchase, restore and use the Theater for meeting space by the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau. When the Anchorage Assembly voted to prohibit the City to act as the loan guarantor, Rasmuson Foundation rescinded the award offer. Due to the economic recession in the following years, these plans did not come to fruition. In 2011, the theater's new owner, Peach Investments, presented new restoration plans.

The Cound Brook rises in the Stretton Hills and discharges into the River Severn at Eyton on Severn after winding its way for across the southern Shropshire- Severn plains. The flow of the Cound Brook can vary from sluggish in a dry summer to a raging torrent in winter or spring. The river is crossed by several bridges along its route including two historic and unusual iron bridges. Several other roads cross the river as fords. The river has breached its banks on the lower flood plain several times in the past and is now monitored by the local rivers authority. The river is named after Cound, the last settlement it passes through prior to the confluence with the River Severn. Conversely one of the villages on its route, Condover, is thought to have been named after the river during the late medieval period. The Coundmoor Brook is a smaller watercourse which flows into the Cound Brook near its confluence with the Severn at Cound. Sources The Cound rises from minor watercourses running off the Long Mynd and Caer Caradoc in the northern part of the \\"Stretton Gap\\", between the settlements of Church Stretton and All Stretton. One of the main initial tributaries is the stream that runs through the Carding Mill Valley, which is named \\"Ashbrook\\" as it flows through Church Stretton. In the village of All Stretton the Ashbrook combines with another considerable stream that comes down the Batch valley, effectively forming the beginning of the Cound, at . The embryonic river descends towards the Shropshire-Severn plain and heads north east mirroring the route of the A49 main road and the Shrewsbury to Hereford railway line. Middle route The brook passes to the east of Leebotwood and west of Longnor and the Medieval deer park there. Continuing to the east of Dorrington village, at Stapleton the Cound changes direction and heads eastwards. The Cound passes through the historic and picturesque Condover with its conservation area and many Listed buildings. A water mill was recorded as standing on the Cound in Condover at the time of the Domesday Book. After Condover the river heads south east through Boreton. Iron bridges Thomas Telford's Cantlop Bridge, built in 1818 To the north of the village of Cantlop there is an unusual cast-iron single-span bridge known as the Cantlop Bridge, that was designed and constructed by Thomas Telford in 1818. Originally a road bridge to cross the Cound Brook, it now remains only as a historic monument as the original 19th century road route is now diverted alongside on a modern bridge. The river then passes through the village of Cound and under another iron bridge, the Coundarbour bridge, also designed and built by Telford, the oldest iron bridge still in normal everyday use anywhere in the world and built in 1797. (Abraham Darby's famous Iron Bridge in Ironbridge, Telford, had closed to vehicular traffic in 1934 and is now only open to pedestrians.) Discharge The Cound Brook now follows an increasingly meandering route across a low lying flood plain until it discharges into the River Severn a few hundred yards west of Eyton on Severn and less than a mile south from Wroxeter (with its Roman city ruins), close to the northern end of the Watling Street Roman road from Dover.

Term Exploration The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in strategic alliances between private corporations, and the formation of long-term public private partnership contracts to rebuild public infrastructure. Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218. In her 1994 Harvard Business Review article \\"Collaborative Advantage\\", Rosabeth Moss Kanter addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist \\"that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections\\". In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. \\"Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration\\" In 2013, Harvard Business Review authors Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector ProjectThe InterSector Project), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth. Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders). Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written \\"A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome.\\" In his book Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools, Rubin asks \\"Who is a collaborative leader?\\" and answers \\"You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship.\\" Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as \\"...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals.\\" Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations. David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world, identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say \\"Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves.\\" Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships , Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of Enrique Pichon-Rivière, who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, Wilfred Bion an influential British psychoanalyst, Kurt Lewin and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.Echavarria, Martin, (2015). Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships. LID Publishing Inc. . Characteristics of collaborative leaders There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders. Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the Harvard Business Review, interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors. The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics: # Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business) # Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management # Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators # Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue # Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time # Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector Madeline Carter, writing for the Center for Effective Public Policy as part of a research project funded by the United States Department of Justice and State Justice Institute, defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:Carter, Madeline M. (2006). The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes. Center for Effective Public Policy. # Willingness to take risks # Eager listeners # Passion for the cause # Optimistic about the future # Able to share knowledge, power and credit Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders: *Find the personal motive for collaborating *Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people *Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance *Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with *Have the courage to act for the long term *Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships *Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels *Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style *Have the confidence to share the credit generously *Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building. Rod Newing writing in a Financial Times supplement special report says \\"If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other\\". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this \\"traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation\\". Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share: * Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments * Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making; clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes * View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources * Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that \\"coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives\\". In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader. The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights. Applications The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas; #Public Private Partnerships #Global Supply Chains #Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems #On-line collaboration – Linux, Wikipedia etc. #Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the credit crunch, climate change and terrorism #The Government- According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.GETHA-TAYLOR, H., & MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71. #Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”Arbabi, A., & Mehdinezhad, V. (2015).

Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization & Sport, 16(2), 125-131. #Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, & Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C.

Early life William Atwood was son and heir of John Atwood of Broomfield, Essex. He studied at Queens' College, Cambridge, before being admitted to the Inner Temple in 1669 and Gray's Inn in 1670, and becoming a barrister in 1674. He acted for the defence for Henry Booth, Lord Delamere at his treason trial in 1685-6. Booth was accused of participation in Monmouth's Rebellion, and the judge in the case was Judge Jeffreys, as Lord High Steward. The defence secured an acquittal.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Atwood, pp. 33–37. In New York He became Chief Justice of New York in 1701; in 1697 the Privy Council in London had moved to set up colonial vice-admiralty courts, able to act quickly in matters of piracy (a live matter in New York at the time), and wrecks.Alvin Rabushka, Taxation in Colonial America: 1607–1775 (2008), p. 316. He was removed a year later, by Lord Cornbury, on a corruption charge. Atwood's position was in fact made very difficult by the governors and the factional politics of New York, after the death of Jacob Leisler. Atwood had presided at the treason trial of mayor Nicholas Bayard (c.1644–1707) of the anti-Leislerian party, at the time of governor Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont. Bellomont was both a major sponsor of William Kidd, charged with piracy, and a Leislerian. When Bellomont died in 1701, the change of governor when Cornbury took over meant a complete about-turn for the local factions, and undermined Atwood's position. In the aftermath, Atwood tried to justify himself, but with little success. His later attack on the poet Matthew Prior, in the anonymous A Modern Inscription to the Duke of Marlborough's Fame, was not only a Whig taking issue with a Tory, but had a peripheral connection with the business of his removal as Justice. Prior was a Commissioner for Trade and Plantations, and this Commission had upheld Cornbury's action. Writing His Fundamental Constitution of the English Government (1690) argued that Parliament could act to fill a vacancy in the monarchy.Julian H. Franklin, John Locke and the Theory of Sovereignty: Mixed Monarchy and the Right of Resistance in the Political Thought of the English Revolution (1981), p. 105. In it he also objected to John Locke's theory, that such a vacancy, which had occurred in 1689, was subject to popular sovereignty.James Tully, An Approach to Political Philosophy: Locke in Contexts (1993), p. 105.J. H. Burns, Mark Goldie, The Cambridge History of Political Thought 1450–1700 (1994), p. 639. It is regarded as a clarifying statement of the moderate Whig position on the political settlement after the Glorious Revolution.Lee Ward, The Politics of Liberty in England and Revolutionary America (2004), p. 279. He wrote also on Scotland, causing the Scottish Parliament to order his works to be burned, by the common hangman: the objectionable The Superiority and Direct Dominion of the Imperial Crown of England (1704), and The Scots Patriot Unmasked.Brendan Bradshaw, Peter Roberts (editors), British Consciousness and Identity: The Making of Britain, 1533–1707 (2004), p. 333. The sentence was carried out in August 1705 at the Market Cross in Edinburgh, a month after James Drake's Historia Anglo-Scotica suffered the same fate. The well-paid James Anderson answered Atwood's case against Scottish independence, in 1705.John Robertson, The Case for the Enlightenment: Scotland and Naples 1680–1760 (2005), p. 135. Atwood replied with The Superiority and Direct Dominion of the Imperial Crown of England ... Reasserted (1705).Leith Davis, Acts of Union: Scotland and the Literary Negotiation of the British Nation, 1707–1832 (1999), note p. 187.

The origins of vegetable carving Vegetable carving, Thailand The origins of vegetable carving are disputed: some believe it to have begun in Japan in ancient times, others believe it to have begun in Sukothai, Thailand 700 years ago, while still others believe that vegetable carving originated in the time of the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) and the Song dynasty (AD 960-1279) in China. =Japan= Japan has also been referred to as the root of the art of fruit and vegetable carving, called Mukimono in Japanese. According to the book \\"Japanese Garnishes, The Ancient Art of Mukimono\\", by Yukiko and Bob Haydok, Mukimono's origins began in ancient times when food was served on unglazed clay pottery. These rough platters were covered with a leaf before the food was plated. Artistic chefs realized that the cutting or folding of the leaf in different ways created a more attractive presentation. Mukimono did not become popular until the sixteenth century, the Edo period, when Mukimono gained official recognition. At this time, street artists created clever garnishes upon request. From these beginnings the art has developed into a very important part of every Japanese chef's training. =Thailand= Another popular theory of the history of vegetable and fruits carving is that it originates in Thailand. It started during the Loi Krathong festival in the 14th century. During Loi Krathong, rafts are individually decorated using many objects, including banana leaves and flowers. In the year 1364, one of King Phra Ruang’s servants, Nang Noppamart, had the desire to create a unique decoration for her raft. Nang carved a flower from a vegetable using a real flower as a pattern. She carved a bird as well and set it beside the flower. Using these carvings, she created a raft that stood out above the rest. King Phra Ruang was impressed by the grace and beauty of the carving and decreed that every woman should learn this new art. Moreover, in the central Thailand, people usually used banana stalk to decorate a bier. Banana stalks were carved by artists into the form of art that called Thaeng yuak art. As the centuries passed, enthusiasm for this art waxed and waned. In 1808, King Rama II loved vegetable carving so much so that he wrote poetry about it. However, during the 1932 revolution in Thailand, appreciation for vegetable carving died down. In order to revive interest, it is taught from the age of 11 in primary schools through secondary school in Thailand. Optional courses are also offered in universities throughout Thailand. Vegetable carving today Regardless of its origins, vegetable carving is flaunted in many different Asian restaurants, cruises, hotels, and other various places. In the mid-20th century, the art of vegetable carving began to grow outside Asia. Since then other cultures have slowly come to appreciate the beauty and culture associated with the practice. Today, one can marvel at vegetable carving throughout the world. The products of vegetable carving are generally flowers or birds; however, the only limit is one’s imagination. The techniques of vegetable carving vary from person to person, as does the final result. Some carvings present more artistic detail, while others have simple, yet beautiful shapes. Vegetable carving is generally used as a garnish, but it can also be used for flower arranging.

The method is, for a given mix and depth, to calculate the depth which would produce the same narcotic effect when breathing air. The equivalent narcotic depth of a breathing gas mix at a particular depth is calculated by finding the depth of a dive when breathing air that would have the same total partial pressure of nitrogen and oxygen as the breathing gas in question. For example, a trimix containing 20% oxygen, 40% helium, 40% nitrogen (trimix 20/40) being used at has an END of . Since air is composed of approximately 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, the narcotic gases make up 100% of the mix, or equivalently the fraction of the total gases which are narcotic is 1.0. Oxygen is assumed equivalent in narcotic effect to nitrogen for this purpose. In contrast, the oxygen and nitrogen component in a trimix containing, for example, 40% helium accounts for only 60% of the mix, i.e. a fraction of 0.6. In a trimix, the fraction of narcotic gases (oxygen and nitrogen) is equal to 1.0 minus the fraction of non-narcotic gas (helium). Calculations  In diving calculations it is assumed unless otherwise stipulated that the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar or 1 atm. and that the diving medium is water. The ambient pressure at depth is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure due to depth and the atmospheric pressure on the surface. =Metres= The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture at a particular depth in metres is given by: : fraction of gas × (depth/10 + 1) So the equivalent narcotic depth can be calculated as follows: : partial pressure of narcotic gases in air at END = partial pressure of narcotic gases in trimix at a given depth. or : (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in air × (END/10 + 1) = (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix × (depth/10 +1) which gives: : 1.0 × (END/10 + 1) = (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix × (depth/10 +1) resulting in: : END = (depth + 10) × (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix − 10 Since (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in a trimix = (1 − fraction of helium), the following formula is equivalent: END = (depth + 10) × (1 − fraction of helium) − 10 Working the earlier example, for a gas mix containing 40% helium being used at 60 metres, the END is: :END = (60 + 10) × (1 − 0.4) − 10 :END = 70 × 0.6 − 10 :END = 42 − 10 :END = 32 metres So at 60 metres on this mix, the diver would feel the same narcotic effect as a dive on air to 32 metres. =Feet= The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture at a particular depth in feet is given by: : fraction of gas × (depth/33 + 1) So the equivalent narcotic depth can be calculated as follows: : partial pressure of narcotic gases in air at END = partial pressure of narcotic gases in trimix at a given depth. or : (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in air × (END/33 + 1) = (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix × (depth/33 +1) which gives: : 1.0 × (END/33 + 1) = (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix × (depth/33 +1) resulting in: : END = (depth + 33) × (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in trimix − 33 Since (fraction of O2 \\\\+ fraction of N2) in a trimix = (1 − fraction of helium), the following formula is equivalent: END = (depth + 33) × (1 − fraction of helium) − 33 As an example, for a gas mix containing 40% helium being used at 200 feet, the END is: :END = (200 + 33) × (1 − 0.4) − 33 :END = 233 × 0.6 − 33 :END = 140 − 33 :END = 107 feet So at 200 feet on this mix, the diver would feel the same narcotic effect as a dive on air to 107 feet.  Oxygen narcosis  Since there is evidence that oxygen plays a part in the narcotic effects of a gas mixture, the NOAA diving manual recommends treating oxygen and nitrogen as equally narcotic. This is now preferred to the previous method of considering only nitrogen as narcotic, since it is more conservative. In this analysis, it is assumed that the narcotic potentials of nitrogen and oxygen are similar. Although oxygen has greater lipid solubility than nitrogen and therefore should be more narcotic (Meyer-Overton correlation), it is likely that some of the oxygen is metabolised, thus reducing its effect to a level similar to that of nitrogen.

Addison Chapel was first established in 1696 as a chapel of ease for St. John's at Broad Creek. The parish it served was one of the thirty original Maryland parishes and was named for Colonel John Addison, of Oxon Hill plantation, a leading proponent of the Anglican Church. His descendant Walter Dulaney Addison, who was for a term Chaplain of the Senate also served as rector here. It is also associated with the Pinkney, Dulany, Lowndes, and Calvert families. In 1983, the vestry voted to vacate the structure and form Holy Redeemer Episcopal Church in Landover. The chapel was not convenient to where the parishioners lived, and a covenant placed by the Maryland Historical Trust barred the installation of indoor plumbing. The Episcopal Diocese of Washington agreed to continue weekly services for another five years, which ended in 1988. Architecture Although the current chapel (the third on this site) was built about 1809, its simple Anglican styling reflects the Colonial-era, Church of England-influenced designs, of which few remain. The church is a small one-story rectangular brick building laid in Flemish bond. St. Matthew's is situated in a large graveyard containing some early stones, the most notable being that of Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

Synthesis  Since many of the uses of antihistamines involve conditions such as rashes, which should be treatable by local application, there is some rationale for developing drugs for topical use. The known side effects of antihistamines could in principle be avoided if the drug were functionalized to avoid systemic absorption. The known poor absorption of quat salts make such derivatives attractive for nonabsorbable antihistamines for topical use.

Lower Svir Zapovednik) is a 416 km² (131 sq mi) zapovednik in Lodeynopolsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, established on June 11, 1980 to protect landscapes of the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga. Geography The nature reserve occupies lowlands on the right bank of the lower Svir River, including a portion of the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga and its waters. The zapovednik's northern border coincides with the border of the Republic of Karelia. The areas across the border belong to Olonetsky Zakaznik. About 30% of the reserve is swamp and peat bog, with additional transient fens and wetlands. The forests are coniferous spruce with an under-story of blueberry bush and shrub. The terrain features sand ridges left by the retreating glaciers in the last Ice Age. The reserve is in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion, and has a humid continental climate (Köppen's Dfb). History It was first proposed in the 1950s that protected areas on the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga be created. At the time, the proposals were rejected by the authorities. The expansion and the industrial growth of the city of Leningrad caused considerable impact on the ecology of surrounding areas, and it was again proposed that a protected area be established to study this impact. In 1976 a large-scale program started, and, in particular, Nizhnesvirsky Zakaznik was established. Eventually, the zakaznik was transformed into a nature reserve in 1980.

It is one of four congregations that have constituted the parish of St. Thomas in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, the others including the Church of the Atonement in Cheltenham, the Chapel of the Incarnation in Brandywine, and St. Simon's Mission also in Croom. The original church was constructed between 1742 and 1745, and is one of the earliest Episcopal churches in Southern Maryland. With the adjacent cemetery, St. Simon's Mission, and St. Simon's Cemetery, it forms part of the St. Thomas' Episcopal Parish Historic District. History The church was completed on December 25, 1745, and was unofficially known as \\"Page's Chapel,\\" as the landowner, Daniel Page, had been contracted to erect the structure. In 1850, St. Thomas' became its own parish and undertook Gothic Revival renovations and expansion under the direction of New York City architect, John W. Priest, an associate of Andrew Jackson Downing. In 1888, the frontal bell tower was erected in memory of Bishop Thomas John Claggett, first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church consecrated in the United States. Recent restoration work, in 1954, was based on the specifications of the original 1740s building contract, but retained Priest's Gothic Revival additions. The church is surrounded on all sides by a cemetery, which contains the graves of many prominent citizens and old county families. A fence and cast iron gate posts with Gothic designs was installed in 1907. Benedict Swingate Calvert, one of the founders of St Thomas' Church, painted by John Wollaston c1754. One of the original founders and benefactors of St Thomas's church was Benedict Swingate Calvert (1730-1788) who was a Maryland Loyalist during the American Revolution. He was the son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, the third Proprietor Governor of Maryland, (1699–1751), and may have been the grandson of King George I of England. His mother's identity is not known and, as he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). He spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony.

This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated. The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America, and other places. The process There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the south of India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India. Solid casting does not use a clay core but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core. The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure beeswax, resin from the tree Damara orientalis, and nut oil. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired. The name Dhokra Damar tribes are the main traditional metalsmiths of West Bengal and Odisha. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from Jharkhand to West Bengal and Orissa; members are distant cousins of the Chhattisgarh Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as Kerala and north as far as Rajasthan and hence are now found all over India. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from Dwariapur, West Bengal, is popular. Recently Adilabad Dokra from Telangana got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.

He enlisted into the 24th Regiment of Foot at Newport on 7 June 1877 having previously served in the Royal Monmouthshire Militia.  From Blaina to South Africa  William was one of a draft that joined the 2/24th in South Africa in July 1878. In January 1878, he was one of the small garrison at Rorke's Drift which held out from over 12 hours when the mission station was attacked by a Zulu force of 4,500 warriors. Following the end of the Zulu war, William remained with the 2nd Battalion when it moved to Gibraltar, but was soon back in Great Britain.  Marriage  Whilst at the Regimental Depot in Brecon, William met, and in November 1880 married, local girl Mary Reeves. Mary was the sister to Sarah Reeves who in 1876 had married Corporal William Wilson Allen – Corporal Allen was awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions at Rorke's Drift.  Service and later life  William Partridge was medically discharged with a pension from the army in November 1881. On 16 April 1930, he died at Blaina aged 71 years.  Funeral  William Partridge was buried at Blaina Cemetery in sunken ground, the plot is marked by a simple wooden cross, which was made by his great-grandson on discovering his resting place 10 years ago. On 21 September 2008 the grave was rededicated with a headstone which donated by Co- Operative Funeral Care. A service at St. Peter's Parish Church, Blaina, was followed by a march to Blaina cemetery, the parade was led by the Regimental band of the Royal Welsh with Royal British Legion standard bearers, 1879 Group Living History Company, and members of the Partridge Family in attendance. At an emotional graveside ceremony Beaufort Choir, accompanied by the band of the Royal Welsh, sang Men of Harlech. The Last Post and a gunfire salute from Martini-Henry rifles, the same type as those used at Rorke’s Drift, concluded the ceremonies. The services were organised by the Royal Welsh Regiment, Blaina Royal British Legion and Blaina Communities First.

It is located at the scientific park of the University of Valencia, in Paterna (Valencia, Spain). History In the autumn of 1950 Prof. Joaquin Catalá formed a group in Valencia to study atomic nuclei and elementary particles using nuclear emulsions. He had first been working in Bristol with C.F. Powell, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1950 for using this technique to detect particles in cosmic rays. Prof. Catalá’s group first operated as a Local Division of the Instituto de Óptica Daza de Valdés belonging to CSIC and specialized in photo-nuclear studies. One of Catalá’s students, Fernando Senent, later becoming Professor and director of the Institute, produced what was the first Spanish thesis in Experimental Particle and Nuclear Physics. It was at the beginning of 1960 when the Institute got its present name, IFIC, Instituto de Física Corpuscular. IFIC, hence, is one of the oldest Spanish Institutes in Experimental Physics and the oldest studying particle and nuclear physics.

Taoism is believed to be the inspiration for spiritual concepts in Japanese culture. Taoism is similar to Shinto in that it also started as an indigenous religion in China, although it is more hermetic than shamanistic. Taoism's influence can be seen throughout the culture but to a lesser extent than Confucianism. Taoism in the form it takes in Japan can be easily seen as superstitious or astrological and the concept of demons and spirits seem to have their roots in a Taoist influence such as Onmyōdō and Shugendō. The widely practiced ritual of setsubun (節分) where chanters repeat \\"Demons out! Luck in!\\" has its base in Taoism and also touches on a relation to uchi-soto. There is a culture of consultation where ogamiyasan are called upon to provide their Taoism based insight to bear upon events such as house-buildings. Taoism has a calendar whereby one can determine the best day, element and time should be chosen to color an event in the right light (Tengenjutsu (fortune telling)). Etymology The Japanese kanji for Taoism is 道教 (Dô-kyô). The root of this kanji is 道 (michi, way, path) + 教 (kyō, doctrine, teaching, education). Dô shares the same Chinese character as tao, 道 which literally means \\"way\\". Taoism in Japan According to a tale from the Nihon Shoki, a man named Tajima Mori set out to explore for the elixir of immortality and reached the Eternal Land, where he brought back the “fragrant fruit” to offer to his ruler; the latter turned out to be already dead so Tajima Mori followed suit. “Scholars have identified it as the immortals’ isles of Penglai, and the ‘fragrant fruit’ as the mandarin orange\\". The legal system of China was brought to Japan in the late 7th and early 8th centuries, specifically a Bureau of yin and yang, the Ommyokan, to handle affairs of time keeping, astronomy, dream interpretation and calendar calculation and yin-yang and the Five Phases cosmology. By the 10th century, it developed with rituals to cast away unlucky tendencies and this became known as the religious practice in Japan called inyodo (Onmyōdō) or yin-yang divination. Taoism also influenced Shugendo, Japan’s shamanistic and mountain worship. It began in the 7th century and combined Buddhism, yin-yang divination, Shinto and Taoist elements. One spell of Taoistic influence is the “Come down, soldiers and fighters, and line up before me!” which is used to enter a holy mountain on certain days. Another ritual formula evident of Taoism is the “Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!” which can be seen in banners, talismans and roof tiles even today in Japan. Taoist influences made their way even to Shinto, specifically Ise and Yoshida Shintō, both of which developed in Kamakura in 1281. Shinto became one of Japan’s political doctrines in the early 20th century, known as the State Shinto. In 1950, the Society for the Research of Daoism was founded. In 1951, the Society published its first journal. One of the Taoist practices in Japan is the Kōshin religion. Koshin refers to the 57th day of the 60-day calendar cycle, where three worms bringing death from the human body go to report of people’s sins in heaven. The worms then go back to the human body and shorten the people’s lifespan by causing illnesses and unhappiness. To avoid this, the Taoists stays awake the whole day and night and perform rituals. “The Koshin cult is the most obvious and best known instance of Taoism in Japan” Kohn, L. (1995).

The main location of the Corts is in the Palace of the Borgias in Valencia; however it can meet at any location in the Valencian lands. The Corts has its origins in bodies established in the thirteenth century by King James I of Aragon.Corts Valencianes y Furs, la obra de Jaume I, Levante EMV, 3 April 2011 The modern institution was established in 1982 under the Valencian statute of autonomy of 1982. The current Corts were elected in 2015. History Following the conquest and reign of James I of Aragon, the economic and military needs of the Crown of Aragon justified some meetings of the king with representatives of the three social classes (the nobility, who controlled the military forces, the church and the middle class), to obtain military or financial services. The economic needs justified those meetings, and at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a stable institution called the Corts Valencianes had already been established. Among the meetings which were held during the reign of James I, the most important was that of 7 April 1261 in Valencia, during which the king promulgated the Furs of Valencia, a series of charters equivalent to a modern constitution. Proof of the economic importance of the corts for the crown is that the king promulgated the Furs in exchange for the sum of 48,000, which were paid to him by the city of Valencia, by the cities of the Horta de València which belonged to the clergy and to the nobility, and by the towns of Castelló, Vilafamés, Onda, Llíria, Corbera, Cullera and Gandia. At the time of those corts, King James established a rule for his successors obliging them to organise a general cort in Valencia at the beginning of each reign, in the first month after their entry into the city. This obligation was renewed during the corts of 1271, the corts were summoned by James I and later by his son Peter III of Aragon. Those Corts were the only obligatory meetings, but the king summoned the corts on other occasions when required. In 1302, James II decided that it was necessary to summon the corts every three years. Later, during the corts of 1336, Peter IV confirmed this triennial meeting, by specifying that the corts were to meet every three years on All Saints' Day. During the thirteenth century and at the beginning of the fourteenth, the representations of the other cities in the Kingdom of Valencia were gradually added, until the corts of 1239, during which the representations of various territories met, already constituting the corts of all the Kingdom. From that moment, the most important cities always met, while others attended depending on the relevance to them of the subjects being discussed. However, the representation was generally important. For example, in the Corts of Valencia of 1510, the following towns were represented: Ademús, Alacant, Alcoi, Alpuente, Alzira, Biar, Bocairent, Borriana, Cabdet, Castelló, Castielfabib, Cullera, Llíria, Morella, Ontinyent, Orihuela, Penàguila, Peníscola, València, Vila Joiosa, Vila-real, Xàtiva, Xèrica and Xixona. Half of the assemblies took place in Valencia cathedral. The Valencian Corts of 1418, fixed the duration of the corts at three years. In the middle of the fifteenth century, the Valencian institutions were definitively established. With the unification of the crowns of Castille and Aragon, the Valencian corts declined in importancedecline of the historic corts and were less frequently convened during the sixteenth century, a trend that continued in the seventeenth century. The last corts met in Valencia in 1645. Finally, after the War of the Spanish Succession and the new decree of 1707, the Kingdom of Valencia and its local rights were abolished. The Corts Valencianes were not convened again until their reestablishment under the Statute of Autonomy of 1982. As of the coming into effect of the Statute of Autonomy, the Corts have operated like a modern representative legislature. Although usually meeting in the provincial capital of Valencia city, they have met in various towns around the Valencian community in recent years, an initiative which has been developed by the most recent legislatures. Modern legislatures The first legislature in modern times was elected in May 1983. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won an absolute majority of votes and seats, with 51 of the 89 seats. However they lost their majority in 1987 and were forced to govern in coalition with the smaller United Left party. They won the 1991 elections with a majority of one seat, winning 45 seats in total. However, in the 1995 elections there was a swing to the right with the People's Party (PP) becoming the largest party with 42 seats and governing in coalition with the smaller Unió Valenciana (Valencian Union). This lasted until the elections of 1999 when the PP won an absolute majority with 49 seats. Although they lost a seat in 2003, they strengthened their position in the elections of 2007 and 2011, winning a record 55 seats. In the 2015 elections PP lost the majority, and PSPV and Compromís are governing in coalition. The Meeting chamber of the Cort Valencianes  Organisation, rules and composition Main entrance to the Corts. (Palace of the Borgias) Following the passing of the statute of autonomy of the Valencian Community, which established local government for the region, the Corts became the regional assembly, elected every four years by universal adult suffrage. The name originated in the historic Valencian Corts, however previous bodies of that name had different functions representing three institutions: the clergy, the military/nobility and the royal family. The Statute of Autonomy primarily defines the Corts Valencianes in chapter II, title II, although there are also references in other articles. The Statute simply indicates the composition of Corts, its functions, the basic principles of the electoral system, and traces the general framework of the Statute of the Deputies. Laws which develop the Statute, the rules of the Corts Valencianes regulate the organization and the operation of the Corts. The first rules were adopted during the transition stage. Since that moment, the rules have been modified on various occasions; the current drafting was ratified on 30 June 1994. The 1982 Statute of Autonomy states that the Corts will have a number of deputies ranging from 75 to 100. The current electoral law fixes the number at 99 deputies, divided according to the provinces and the electoral constituencies. Currently in the legislature 35 deputies are elected for the Province of Alicante, 24 deputies for the Province of Castellón and 40 deputies for the Province of Valencia. The Statute of Autonomy also states that to be elected, candidates must belong to a list which obtains at least 5% of the total number of votes. Certain political parties and alliances who fail to achieve that threshold, cannot enter the Parliament. For lists which cross the 5% barrier, the distribution of seats is done according to the D'Hondt method.

Today they are hired primarily by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and serve in many public health programs. This type of worker is unique in public health, because they begin their service at the entry level of public health doing what is known as \\"field work\\" or \\"contact epidemiology\\" which refers to the interviewing and locating of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease so as to offer them treatment and to reduce the epidemic. Following their initial work experiences, PHAs are exposed to a variety of public health programs across the United States, learning to function at all levels of the public health system. During their time of service, PHAs are called upon to respond to public health or humanitarian crisis. This article will briefly describe the history of the Public Health Advisor and will mention a few notable contributions made over the course of their history with the Public Health Service and later with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. History and Purpose The United States Public Health Service has historically placed personnel in local areas to assist with disease outbreaks or to advise various public health programs.Fitzhugh Mullan, Plagues and Politics: The Story of the United States Public Health Service (New York: Basic Books, 1989) Medical officers and other personnel such as environmental health officers, nurses or in some cases technical workers like laboratorians would be sent to local and state health departments for temporary assignments.Elizabeth W. Etheridge, Sentinel for Health: A History of the Centers for Disease Control (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992). Though the Public Health Advisor is an example of this type of locally placed personnel, it was not until the 1940s that the U.S. federal government placed public health workers to do anything more than advise or assist local public health efforts. The purpose of the Public Health Advisor, or \\"PHA,\\" was to help implement venereal disease \\"VD\\" programs (as they were known at the time, now known as STDs for sexually transmitted disease) because the job of controlling VD was not entirely effective.Thomas Parran, \\"Why Don't We Stamp Out Syphilis?\\" Reader's Digest (July 1936): 65-74. For example, in 1935 U.S. health surveys indicated that at any one time, 683,000 persons were under treatment and observation for syphilis. This same year saw 518,000 new infections, 100,000 of them among persons under twenty years of age.Thomas Parran, Jr. (1937), Shadow on the Land: Syphilis Baltimore, MD: Waverly Press, 1937, 54, 62.Raymond A. Vonderlehr, Herman N. Bundesen, Lida J. Usilton, et al., \\"Recommendations for a Venereal Disease Control Program in State and Local Health Departments.\\" Report of the Advisory Committee to the U.S. Public Health Service. Venereal Disease Information 17, no. 1, reprint No. 54.Journal of the American Medical Association 106 (January 1936): 115-117. Washington, January 1936. By the end of World War II, it was estimated that one in ten persons would have syphilis in their lifetime. The disease was devastating if untreated, causing more than fifteen percent of all blindness, fifty percent of perinatal blindness, and eighteen percent of deaths from heart disease. In the late 1930s, 60,000 children were born each year with congenital syphilis.Lida J. Usilton, \\"Mortality Trends for Syphilis,\\" Journal of Venereal Disease Information, 27 (February, 1946): 47-52. Following both World Wars (I and II), syphilis was seeded in the population because the public health infrastructure was not funded well enough to respond to cases of the disease.Allan M. Brandt, No Magic Bullet: A Social History of Venereal Disease in the United States Since 1880 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). See also Raymond A. Vonderlehr and Lida J. Usilton, \\"The Extent of the Syphilis Problem at the Beginning of World War II.\\" New York State Journal of Medicine 43 (October, 1943): 1825. Also found in American Journal of Syphilis, Gonorrhea and Venereal Diseases, 27 (November 1943): 686. Physicians were not consistently reporting to the local health authorities when patients were diagnosed with syphilis, and (more importantly), the sexual partners of patients were not being identified or contacted so that they too might be offered curative treatment for syphilis.Thomas Parran, \\"Syphilis: A Public Health Problem,\\" in Syphilis, ed. Forest Ray Moulton, (Lancaster, PA: The Science Press, 1938), 187-193. As such, syphilis was prevalent in the U.S. population, such that the federal government opted to initiate help to local venereal disease programs in states and local areas. The kind of help needed was more than advice to programs. Advisors had been provided to the state and local public health departments during the 1940s; however, cases of syphilis remained. What was needed was help with the patients themselves – a task called contact epidemiology which involved interviewing people who were newly diagnosed with syphilis, identifying their sexual partners, and then going out into the community to locate these partners and bringing them into the clinic or to their physicians for examination and, if necessary, treatment. This job was the job of the venereal disease investigator; a job that was being done in some of the local areas, but neither uniformly nor effectively. To meet the need for VD investigators, the VD Division of the U.S. Public Health Service hired a small group of college graduates to work as VD investigators for the federal government. These initial recruits were assigned to work on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.Beth E. Meyerson, Fred A. Martich and Gerald P. Naehr, Ready to Go: The History and Contributions of U.S. Public Health Advisors (Research Triangle Park: American Social Health Association, 2008). Contributions of Public Health Advisors After their introduction in 1948, the Public Health Advisor became an important part of the public health infrastructure of local and state health departments. In 1957 when the Public Health Service transferred the Venereal Disease Division to the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta (which later became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), PHAs were quickly recognized as an asset to other public health efforts because they were trained in phlebotomy (drawing of blood through venipuncture), they knew how to organize mass testing and could investigate diseases, and they could manage public health programs. Public Health Advisors were soon called upon by the CDC to help with polio efforts in 1961, they built the national Immunization Program following the passage of the Vaccine Assistance Act of 1962, they were soon recruited to work in the Tuberculosis Program, and by 1992 could be found in virtually all of CDC programs working at local, state and federal levels of the public health system. In addition to their regular assignments in the public health system, PHAs are called upon to respond to disease outbreaks or health disaster. Establishing a locally trained and geographically varied workforce has allowed CDC to have ready and deployable human resources for emergencies or emerging needs anywhere in the world. PHAs are part of a deployable team that can be credited with the eradication of smallpox, the identification of new strains of disease, and the halting of epidemics. PHAs have been called to respond to outbreaks of disease such as hantavirus, Lassa fever, monkeypox, encephalitis, tuberculosis, measles, AIDS, smallpox, polio, Legionnella, Guillain–Barré syndrome, SARS, syphilis, PPNG, babesiosis, and cholera. PHAs were assigned to work in health campaigns such as Guinea worm, malaria, syphilis, diarrheal diseases, yellow fever, yaws, swine flu, and measles. PHAs have been sent to respond to major events such as floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and the anthrax scare in the U.S.Gerald Naehr, \\"PHA Response to International and Domestic Crises\\" (Attachment IV).

Educated at the Séminaire de Ste-Thérèse and afterwards at the Séminaire de Rigaud. In 1890, de Lotbiniere-Harwood graduated in medicine from Université Laval, Quebec City. In 1894, he went to Europe to take a course of advanced studies, particularly gynaecology.Men and Books, 1934 In France, he had the opportunity to study under, and serve as the assistant to, Samuel Jean de Pozzi, who was then France's foremost gynaecologist and would remain his mentor. Career Returning to Montreal in 1896, de Lotbinière-Harwood was appointed assistant gynaecologist at the Hôpital Notre-Dame under Dr Brennan, until Brennan's death in 1903 when he became the head gynaecologist. During World War One, he was the moving spirit in the patriotic effort that resulted in the foundation of the General Military Hospital of Laval located at Joinville-le-Pont near Paris. He was widely regarded as the accredited international link between the English and French members of his profession, and France rewarded him for this by making him an Officer of the Légion d'honneur.Pages of History in Canadian Obstetrics and Gynaecology - Page 111 He was one of the promoters of the conference of French-speaking members of the medical profession which was first held in Montreal and was attended by all the prominent French doctors of the day in Europe and North America.L'Union Medicale du Canada He held several the prominent office: Dean of the Medical Faculty of University of Montreal (1918); Professor of Gynaecology at the University of Montreal; Superintendent of the University Council; President of the Hôpital Notre-Dame; President of the Radium Institute, Paris; corresponding Secretary of the Surgical Society of Paris; Vice-President of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada; Vice-President of the Association of French-speaking Doctors of North America; Fellow of the American College of Surgeons; member of the General Board of Examiners; President of the Medical Union of Canada and vice-president of the Cercle Universitaire. He was a director of and a contributor to L'Union Medicale du Canada for fifteen years. A contemporary at the University of Montreal (where some described him as the 'Father of Canadian Gynaecology') said of him,100 ans de Medicine Francophone, Guy Grenier A charming man, never reading, in no way devoted to letters, he yet possessed an untiring activity, a great ambition, a talent for action and government which made him a remarkable dean. One need not look for his writings, he wrote little. One need not analyse his teaching, he made scarcely more of this. But, with the help of his friends, he reorganised the Faculty of Medicine, accomplished the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame Hospital, and in the direction of the University of Montreal, he took a leading part... His charm and his distinguished manners had gained for him the respect of every one whom he met. His high stature, the dignity of his bearing, the distinction of his gesture commanded general attention... a gentleman with all the meaning that this word implies... Gifted with great executive ability, a nimble mind, tact and unusual charm of manner, he would seem to have been destined for pre-eminence in any station. Family Château de Terrebonne, the childhood home of his first wife who was also his cousin His chief pastime was farming and cattle breeding. He was vice-president of the Holstein (cattle) Breeders Association of Quebec, and his farm where he lived at Vaudreuil, Het Loo, was noted for its fine herd of Holstein-Friesen cattle. He was married three times. In 1891, he married his cousin, Marie-Berthe-Adéline Masson (1871-1904), daughter of Henri Masson (1836-1880) and Coralie Globensky, niece of Lt.-Colonel Maximilien Globensky. She was a granddaughter of Joseph Masson of Château de Terrebonne, and the stepdaughter of another of his relations, Sir Henri-Thomas Taschereau, brother of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, Prime Minister of Quebec.

Erlestoke is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is the only prison in Wiltshire. Erlestoke House The prison is built around Erlestoke House, a country house built by Joshua Smith, Member of Parliament for Devizes, between 1780 and 1810. During the Second World War the house was used as a training school for the Special Operations Executive. A single-storey lodge from the early 19th century stands at the roadside entrance to the grounds of the house. The lodge, together with gate piers and wrought iron railings of similar date, is Grade II listed. Prison history Erlestoke House was seriously damaged by a fire in 1950 and was then converted into a prison, with many additional buildings constructed. The site was first used by the Prison Commission in 1960 as a detention centre, became a young prisoners' centre in 1977, and a Category C adult male training prison in 1988. In 1998, it was reported that thieves had broken into Erlestoke Prison and stolen £3000 worth of gardening tools from a shed.HighBeam Two years later, two inmates from Erlestoke used a makeshift ladder in a daylight jailbreak. The two escapees then stole a car from a nearby farm, but then crashed it, and were subsequently recaptured by the police.HighBeam In December 2001, an inspection of Erlestoke by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons found cells in the oldest part of the prison had damp walls and poor furniture. Cleanliness was also criticised, as was the ability of some staff \\"to adapt to new ideas on rehabilitation\\" at the prison. However, a year later, a report declared Erlestoke Prison one of the best in the country, with a Government official describing the inspection report as \\"astoundingly good\\". In March 2005, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board found that violent incidents at the prison had dramatically increased, to 1,400 annual incidents from its previous 800. In 2005, an employment tribunal awarded nearly £400,000 damages to a white prison officer of South African descent for \\"enduring years of racial abuse\\" in connection with black prisoners targeting him for his clearly identifiable accent. According to the officer, he had received little assistance from the prison's management. In August 2017, prison staff successfully ended a disturbance involving a few prisoners. Current usage  Erlestoke Prison receives adult male prisoners from much of England and Wales, as well as from local prisons in South Wales and Bristol in particular. Accommodation at the prison comprises eight accommodation units, 3 Enhanced (Imber, Kennet and Sarum); 3 Standard (Alfred, Wessex and Silbury); 1 Lifer and long-term prisoner unit (Avebury) and an Induction Unit (Marlborough). Most cells are single occupancy with integral sanitation. However, there are a small number of double, purpose-built cells on two of the accommodation units, and two three-bed cells on one other accommodation unit. Attempted escapes In September 2010, a low-risk prisoner, doing gardening work outside the prison, decided to escape with the prison's tractor that he was using at the time. Having travelled about ten miles, he was spotted by a former prison officer from Erlestoke who recognised the tractor and alerted the authorities, before tailing the tractor. Realising he was being pursued, the prisoner drove onto a golf course and was followed by several police vehicles; after abandoning the vehicle, he tried to flee on foot but was cornered by a police dog and taken back into custody.  Notable inmates  Alexander Blackman, often referred to as \\"Marine A\\", was held at HMP Erlestoke, having been charged with murdering an injured Taliban insurgent in the 2011 Helmand Province incident. He was found guilty in November 2013 and sentenced the following month. This sentence was reduced to manslaughter with diminished responsibility in March 2017.

Construction and commissioning Walworth County was laid down as USS LST-1164 on 22 September 1952 at Pascagoula, Mississippi by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 15 May 1953, sponsored by Mrs. John A. Furr, and commissioned on 26 October 1953, Lieutenant F. Kay in command. Operations in U.S. waters 1953–1956 LST-1164 departed Pascagoula on 20 November 1953, bound for Norfolk, Virginia. She conducted shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay and became a unit of Landing Ship Tank Division 23. The ship arrived at her home port of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia Beach, Virginia, on 3 December 1953. On 6 April 1954, LST-1164 departed the amphibious base for a brief stop at the United States Naval Reserve training center at Jacksonville, Florida. On 19 April 1954, the ship took part in simulated nuclear warfare strikes and returned to Little Creek on 25 May 1954. LST-1164 spent June 1954 participating in amphibious exercises at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. LST-1164 returned to Little Creek on 11 July 1954 for voyage repairs in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, and towing exercises off Little Creek beach. From 3 November 1954 through 24 March 1955, the ship participated in various exercises with the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army in the areas of Camp Pendleton, Virginia; Onslow Beach, North Carolina; and Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. On 30 March 1955, LST-1164 entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a four-month overhaul. During that period, she was named USS Walworth County (LST-1164) on 1 July 1955. She returned to Little Creek on 5 August 1955 and conducted exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. The ship put to sea on 21 September 1955 for nuclear attack drills along the United States East Coast; gunnery practice in operating areas out of Jacksonville, Florida, and assault beaching runs with men of the 3rd Marine Regiment (United States) 3rd Marine Regiment and their vehicles and combat equipment on the coast of North Carolina. Walworth County returned to Little Creek on 8 November 1955 and spent the following months in local waters with trips to Guantanamo Bay and the Caribbean. First Mediterranean deployment 1956 Walworth County left Norfolk with a load of ammunition on 7 May 1956 and, two weeks later, arrived at the United States naval base at Port Lyautey, French Morocco. On 9 May 1956, she sailed for Greece and arrived at Piraeus on 30 May 1956 for operations with an amphibious task force of the United States Sixth Fleet which took her to principal ports of the Mediterranean Sea. Walworth County returned home to Little Creek on 26 September 1956. She spent the remainder of 1956 in local operating areas. In January 1956, as part of LANTRAEX-56, she left Morehead City, NC for Vieques, Puerto Rico carrying tanks in her well deck, trucks and construction equipment topside along with Marines from the 2nd Shore Party Bn. 2nd Marine Division. Panama deployment 1957 On 5 March 1957, Walworth County arrived at the Naval Base Coco Solo at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone. From there, she took survey parties to beaching sites in the Chagres River and other places in preparation for Operation Caribex which tested the mobility of American forces in defending the Panama Canal. Operations in U.S. waters and Caribbean exercise 1957–1958 Walworth County returned to Little Creek from her Panama cruise on 16 March 1957 and put to sea on 10 April 1957 to participate in a three-phase operation involving the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Army, and the United States Air Force. The exercise—conducted on Vieques Island, Fort Lorenzo, Canal Zone, and Rio Hata — terminated on 28 April 1957; and Walworth County underwent extended upkeep in the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, from 14 May 1957 through 11 July 1957. She returned to Little Creek the following day and began local operations which lasted until 14 November 1957. At that time, Walworth County undertook exercises with amphibious warfare forces that included practice assaults with Marines on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Second Mediterranean deployment 1958 Walworth County returned to Little Creek on 25 March 1958 but a month later headed for Morehead City, North Carolina. There, she loaded Marines and combat cargo in preparation for an amphibious training operation to be held in the Mediterranean with forces of the United Kingdom and Italy. She transited the Strait of Gibraltar on 14 May 1958 and visited the ports of Izmir, Turkey; Athens, Greece; and Suda Bay, Crete. However, the operation was cancelled because of Middle East tensions, and Walworth County had the distinction of acting as a primary control ship in the initial landing of Marines at Beirut, Lebanon, on 15 July 1958. Her operations in this area continued until 1 October 1958 when she departed Beirut and sailed for the United States. She reached Morehead City on 19 October 1958 and became a unit of Amphibious Squadron 6. Third Mediterranean deployment 1959–1960 From 12 December 1958 to 24 February 1959, Walworth County underwent an overhaul in the Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston, South Carolina. The ship conducted local operations and visited Guantanamo Bay before sailing for Spain. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 30 July 1959 and commenced her third Mediterranean tour which lasted until 9 February 1960. Operations in U.S. waters 1960 Walworth County returned to Morehead City and spent the following months conducting practice landings at Onslow Beach, making cruises to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and to Bermuda, and completing another tour of duty in the Caribbean Sea that included amphibious warfare practice in the waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Fourth Mediterranean deployment 1960–1961 On 28 October 1960, Walworth County sailed from Little Creek with Amphibious Squadron 6 for a fourth Mediterranean deployment. The ship gave effective support to assault practice with Marine battalion landing teams at Augusta Bay, Sicily; with Greek raider teams at Nauplion, Greece; and with both Amphibious Squadrons 6 and 4 and two Marine battalion landing teams at Portoscuso, Sardinia. Operations in U.S. waters 1961–1962 Walworth County returned to Little Creek on 19 May 1961 and underwent overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard through September 1961. She spent the remainder of 1961 in amphibious assault training on Onslow Beach and at Camp Pendleton, Virginia, where she took part in Army landing assault training. Walworth County departed Little Creek on 17 January 1962, embarked Marines at Morehead City, and headed for Guantanamo Bay to participate in Operation Springboard 62. The ship made calls at several Caribbean ports and then disembarked the Marines at Morehead City on 1 March 1962. On 5 March 1962, she returned to Norfolk where she was placed on restricted availability status until 15 May 1962. Fifth Mediterranean deployment 1962 In May 1962, Walworth County embarked Marines of \\"Foxtrot\\" Company, Battalion Landing Team 2/6 and, on 1 June 1962, proceeded to tour the entire length of the Mediterranean from Alicante, Spain, to Marmaris, Turkey, where she operated with combined Turkish and Greek forces. After extensive exercises, including seven amphibious training assaults on various beaches, she sailed for her home port and changed direction in middle of Atlantic as Quarter master and myself a (stricker) were on watch at the time. Extended a straight to the nearest land which happened to be Cuba. The Cuban Missile Crisis and operations in U.S. waters 1962–1964 On 21 October 1962, the day after she arrived at Norfolk, Walworth County was called upon to participate in the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and operated in the Caribbean with the ready amphibious group until 4 December 1962, when she returned to the United States and debarked Marines at Morehead City. Walworth County arrived at Norfolk the following day and spent the remainder of 1962 in leave and upkeep. During the early part of 1963, Walworth County conducted local operations in the Little Creek area. After entering Gibbs Shipyard at Jacksonville, Florida, on 3 April 1963, she completed her scheduled yard period and sea trials, then headed for Little Creek on 10 June 1963. The ship took part in amphibious refresher training through July and August 1963, followed by a three-week period of restricted availability. During the remainder of 1963, she participated in local operations, visited Rockland, Maine, to obtain tactical data for the LST-1156-class landing ships tank (of which she was a part), and underwent overhaul. Panama deployment, operations in U.S. waters, and Spain deployment 1964 In January 1964, Walworth County got underway for Panama where she spent more than four months, making 16 transits of the Panama Canal, including one round trip which she completed in less than 23 hours. Late in May 1964, she returned to Little Creek and, after tender availability, took part in the \\"MEBLEX\\" and midshipman exercises. Following this, she made a call to New York for the 1964 World's fair and returned to Little Creek on 11 August 1964. While in port, Walworth County was used in the production of a Bureau of Medicine and Surgery mental health movie. In late August 1964, Walworth County again got underway for a lift to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and returned via Miami, Florida, on 13 September 1964. Walworth County spent a short period in the yard before getting underway on 5 October 1964 for \\"Steel Pike I,\\" the largest amphibious exercise since World War II. Besides carrying out her role in the operation, she called at Rota, Spain, and the Canary Islands before returning home on 28 November 1964. Operations in U.S. waters 1964–1965 Walworth County spent the end of 1964 and beginning of 1965 undergoing tender availability. In early February 1965, she sailed for Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, and took liberty in the U.S. Virgin Islands and at San Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico. She arrived back at Little Creek on 8 March 1965 and then participated in exercises to train U.S. Army personnel in amphibious warfare. Following these training exercises, the ship conducted local operations and made preparations for an upcoming deployment. Sixth Mediterranean deployment 1966 Having completed all preparations, Walworth County got underway with Amphibious Squadron 6 on 24 January 1966. She proceeded to Bermuda as an escort for minesweepers when the squadron was recalled. After spending one week in Bermuda, she returned to Little Creek.

She arrived at Morehead City on 8 June 1968 and proceeded to Little Creek, where she arrived on 9 June 1968 Operations in U.S. waters 1968 After a month of maintenance, Walworth County participated in a riverine warfare exercise in Virginia's James River, which taught the fundamentals of river warfare and lessons learned in the Vietnam War, from 9 July 1968 to 19 July 1968. The ship then spent the remainder of July and most of August undergoing a tender availability. Southern Command deployment 1968–1969 Walworth County got underway on 23 September 1968 for a United States Southern Command deployment as a member of Landing Ship Tank Division 41. After a trip to the Panama Canal Zone, she got underway on 9 October 1968 for a visit to Jamaica. Upon reaching Montego Bay, Walworth County was called back to Panama when an uprising overthrew the Panamanian government. She arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 14 October 1968 and, the next day, transited the canal to the Pacific Ocean. She remained at the Rodman Naval Station in Panama until 8 November 1968. Loaded with Operation Handclasp material, Walworth County got underway for Ecuador on 8 November 1968 and arrived at Guayaquil on 9 November 1968. She returned to Rodman Naval Station on 17 November 1968 and, except for four amphibious landings and a round-trip transit of the Panama Canal, remained there until 9 January 1969. Operations in U.S. waters and the Caribbean 1969–1970 From 1 March 1969 to 16 May 1969, Walworth County underwent upkeep at the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation in Berkley, Virginia. The ship then began a period of upkeep at her home port of Little Creek. On 21 July 1969, she started amphibious refresher training and then prepared for movement overseas. From 15 September 1969 through 25 November 1969, the ship operated in the Caribbean Ready Group. Upon her return to Little Creek, Walworth County began another period of leave and upkeep. Then she conducted a training exercise from 12 January 1970 to 16 January 1970. On 30 January 1970, she began a month of tender availability by repair ship USS Vulcan (AR-5), which was moored at the Naval Station Norfolk. This work lasted until 20 February 1970, when Walworth County returned to Little Creek. South America and Panama deployment 1970 Following several months of local operations, Walworth County sailed independently on 8 July 1970 for South America. Her mission was primarily one of good will. She delivered earthquake relief supplies to Peruvian ports and carried Project Handclasp material to Ecuador. For the remainder of the deployment, Walworth County carried out many and varied missions, ranging from being a home for Smithsonian Institution scientists performing marine biology research to acting as a ferryboat for United States exhibits to a regional fair at Bocas del Toro, Panama. The scientists worked with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, which conducts research all around Panama including the Panama Canal, Bocas del Toro Archipelago, and Laguna de Chiriquí.About the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

During her three-month deployment, Walworth County steamed over 9,000 nautical miles (16,668 kilometers), and she received a letter of commendation from Admiral C. D. Nace, Commander, United States Naval Forces, Southern Command and Commandant, 15th Naval District. After a final transit of the Panama Canal, Walworth County headed homeward, arriving back at Little Creek on 23 October 1970. Inactivation and decommissioning 1971 Following the post-deployment leave periods, Walworth County commenced preparations for inactivation. On 4 January 1971, operational and administrative control of the ship was shifted from Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Norfolk, Virginia. After three months of work by her crew, Walworth County was decommissioned on 2 April 1971. She subsequently was towed to Orange, Texas, where she arrived on 14 April 1971. She was drydocked on 11 May 1971 for the underwater phase of inactivation, with the topside phase scheduled to commence upon completion of the drydock phase. She then was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Texas Group at Orange, Texas. Military Sealift Command service 1972–1973 In May 1972, Walworth County was scheduled for transfer to the Maritime Administration and layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California, but instead she served in a non-commissioned status with a primarily civilian crew as a cargo ship in the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as a United States Naval Ship, USNS Walworth County (T-LST-1164), from May 1972 until stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. Reserve status and transfer to Peru On 19 June 1974, Walworth County was turned over to the Maritime Administration and berthed at Suisun Bay as part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. On 7 August 1984, Walworth County and three of her sister ships -- USS Traverse County (LST-1160), USS Waldo County (LST-1163), and USS Washoe County (LST-1165)—were leased to Peru, and Walworth County was commissioned into service in the Peruvian Navy as Paita (DT-141) on 4 March 1985. Peru renewed the lease on all four ships in August 1989 and August 1994,Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, 2001-2002, p. 521. and the United States sold all four outright to Peru on 26 April 1999 under the Security Assistance Program; all four were struck from the U.S. Naval Register on the day of the sale.

At 500 laps, or 125 miles, the race is unusually long for sprint car races (typically races are between 10 and 50 miles), and is considered one of the premier wingless asphalt sprint car races. The field consists of 33 cars lined up in eleven rows of three, mimicking the traditional Indy 500 lineup. Many eventual Indy 500 drivers competed in the Little 500 over the years.

The Guardian newspaper named ICE GHOSTS one of the best science books of 2017. The CBC, Canada’s national broadcaster, put Ice Ghosts at the top of its 2017 \\"Holiday Gift Guide: 12 Books for the Science and Nature Enthusiast on Your List.\\" Biography Watson was born in Weston, Ontario. He was awarded the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography for his photograph, taken in 1993 while covering the civil war in Somalia for the Toronto Star newspaper. The photograph depicted US Army 160th SOAR, Super 64 crew chief Staff Sgt. William Cleveland's body being dragged by Somalis through the streets of Mogadishu. His reporting and photography spans almost three decades and includes conflicts in more than a dozen countries on several continents. Among those are: Eritrea, Somalia, southern Sudan, Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Romania, Serbia and Kosovo, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Iraq and Syria. While at the Toronto Star, Watson earned four Canadian National Newspaper Awards for photography and stories on the child sex trade in Asia, anarchy in Somalia following the 1991 overthrow dictator Mohammed Siad Barre, and the torture and murder of a Somali teen by Canadian soldiers after a U.S.-led force intervened to end a famine in 1992. He received the Drummer General’s Award in 2007 for his book Where War Lives, based on his experiences as a war journalist. The Globe and Mail of Toronto named it one of the \\"year’s 100 most notable books\\". His second book, Magnum Revolution: 65 Years of Fighting for Freedom, showcases the legendary agency's photographers' images of, and personal insights into uprisings spanning almost seven decades. It was co-written with The New Yorker′s Jon Lee Anderson and published by Prestel in Europe, the U.S. and Canada in 2012. Watson was featured in director Martyn Burke's 2012 documentary Under Fire: Journalists in Combat, which was shortlisted for an Academy Award. The film won a prestigious Peabody Award in 2013. His work is on permanent display at the Newseum, in Washington, D.C., in the journalism museum's Pulitzer Prize Photographs Gallery. Watson is also the subject of the Kennedy Award-winning play by Dan O'Brien entitled The Body of an American, staged in London in 2014. The collaboration led to O'Brien's book of poetry War Reporter, published in the U.S. and Europe in 2013. Paul Watson holds a Master's Degree from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs in New York. He was the South Asia bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, where his coverage area included Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Iraq. He was Southeast Asia bureau chief, based in Jakarta, when he left the Los Angeles Times to return to The Toronto Star in July, 2009. He also served as Balkans bureau chief for the LA Times during his decade as a foreign correspondent with the newspaper. In 2015, Watson resigned from the Toronto Star, where he was a multi-media reporter, covering the Arctic and Aboriginal beat. He also did foreign assignments in Afghanistan, Syria, Russia and India in his second stint at The Toronto Star, which was then Canada's largest circulation daily newspaper. His resignation followed The Star's decision to kill an investigative story into the then Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper to use the historic 2014 discovery of the wreck of Sir John Franklin's flagship, HMS Erebus, for political propaganda. The story was then published by BuzzFeed and won a National Magazine Award for investigative reporting along with a Digital Publishing Award for long-form storytelling. Watson was the only journalist aboard CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker, the lead vessel in the 2014 Victoria Strait Expedition, when archeologists aboard found Erebus in eastern Queen Maud Gulf, in the same area where Inuit had said for generations a large ship went down. Watson tells the story of the hunt for the lost Franklin Expedition in his 2017 book Ice Ghosts. In 2018, Ice Ghosts was a finalist for the Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize.

It stars Pilar Lopez de Ayala, Verónica Sánchez and Marta Etura. The plot, based on a true story, follows the tragic fate of Las Trece Rosas, fighting for their ideals in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Plot In Madrid in 1939 during the final days of the Spanish Civil War, Virtudes and Carmen, two young idealistic Republican militants, are encouraging their neighbours to keep faith in the cause of the Second Republic. However, the entry of Franco's Nationalist troops into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are unable or unwilling to do so. Julia, a streetcar attendant, and her friend Adelina, a Red Cross worker, are also active sympathizers of the Spanish Republic. While spending an evening in a nightclub watching musicians perform, one of the last bombings of the city takes place. In those dire circumstances they befriend Blanca, whose husband Enrique is the musicians' band leader. The triumph of the Nationalist troops marks a dark turning point in the lives of those who sympathized with the Republic. Canepa, one of the musicians in Enrique's band, is a Republican militant. Fearing for his life, he decides to leave the country. Blanca, Enrique's wife, gives him some money to help him on his way. Meanwhile, Julia strikes up a relationship with dapper young nationalist soldier Perico. It is rumoured that there was a plot to assassinate Franco on his victorious entry into the capital, and the nationalists are seeking revenge. Although the girls have nothing to do with it, they have been targeted for their propagandistic leftist activities. The first to be arrested is Julia, who, before too long, is being sadistically tortured by the orders of Fontenla, the cold-hearted officer in charge of the interrogations. Adelina, Virtudes' co-worker, like most of the others is a member of a socialist group. She is turned in by her well-meaning father in the naïve belief that nothing serious will happen to her and that she is just wanted for questioning. Canepa and Teo are turned in by friends and neighbours and are tortured. Canepa commits suicide while under arrest. Teo has better luck and is eventually released on the condition that he has to secretly help to identify and capture his friends, sympathisers of the Republic. With Teo's help, one by one the girls are arrested, and soon they have all been jailed. Only Carmen, the youngest of the girls of the group, realises Teo's double- crossing, but she is also arrested. Blanca also suffers the same fate. Her crime is to have given Canepa some money. After suffering heavy police interrogations, the young group of women are eventually transferred to an overcrowded prison. The reunion of the girls in jail serves as a consolation to their dire circumstances. At one point, they even enjoy a bit of tap- dancing. Their families, including Adelina's grief-stricken father, are hoping that they will eventually be released. Blanca is worried about her small son that she was forced to leave behind. Her admirable behaviour and her serenity while in jail made her gain the respect of the woman in charge of the prison. However, their situation worsens when the group of women complain of the terrible sanitary condition for the children imprisoned with their mothers. As a protest they jointly refused to sing the praises of the Franco regime. The fate of the 13 young women is sealed when two military officers and an innocent woman are killed in cold blood by a group of leftist militants. As a punishment, the regime orders the execution of some of the prisoners, though they have nothing to do with what has happened while they are in jail. A military court condemns the 48 men and 13 women to death in less than 48 hours. Carmen, the youngest of all, is the only survivor of the group. Desolated, she listens to the shots that killed her terrified friends. The final frame of the film asserts that the bulk of the content is verifiable from documentation and that the script relies heavily on actual dialogue or writings from the central characters.  Cast  Reception 13 Roses opened on 19 October 2007. The film had a limited release in the USA in New York City. The review in Variety praised the cinematography and art direction, but remarked: \\"The 13 Roses largely withers on the vine. [The film] is further let down by its psychological superficiality… an uncertain treatment which convinces neither historically nor dramatically\\". =Accolades= 13 Roses received 14 nominations to the Goya Awards. It won four Goyas: Best Cinematography, best Costume design, best original score and best supporting actor (José Manuel Cervino).

History Former logo, as Midia Năvodari. The club was originally founded in 1993, under the name of Midia Năvodari. The club did not achieve much in its short existence, but was a solid club, playing in the Liga II for almost a decade, being involved in the promotion battle almost every season. Its best standing was Runner-up at the end of the 1999–2000 Divizia B and the 2004–05 Divizia B. Until its contract expiration in April 2003 the head coach of the team was Leonida Nedelcu and later on in 2003 it was Ionel Melenco. The withdrawal of the club's main sponsor Petromidia, led to its dissolution in 2008.

Her specific genres include soul, blues and Americana enriched with some country and pop elements. Duffy is known for her exceptional voice inspired by the wellsprings of Memphis but it also reflects the rich undercurrents of her Irish Celtic roots. One of her trademarks is her poetically crafted lyrics and her enigmatic stage presence. 2008 saw Duffy play 3 days at the Acoustic stage at the world renowned Glastonbury Festival 2008. In 2009 she was approached by BBC to record a version of the Oleta Adams song ‘Get Here’ for a TV promotion campaign. It was recorded at the prestigious George Martin’s Air Studios in London. In March 2018, Spotify listed Duffy as in the Top 50 Women Honouring Blues. Grainne Duffy is sister of the popular Irish actress Joanne Brennan. Early life & career Grainne Duffy was born in Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan, Ireland and raised in a family of seven. As a schoolgirl she sang in her local choir and also in a family band with her sisters. The band was bred from their love of music, which Duffy accredits to her mother. Not having a television in their home when they were young, her mother instead allowed them to own a family record player, on which they all were encouraged to get a record on their individual birthday’s and Christmas. This broadened their interest in music and they began listening to artists such as Aretha Franklin, The Pretenders and The Rolling Stones. Around that time Grainne discovered Fleetwood Mac and the blues playing of Peter Green, whom she cites as one her main guitar influences. Previous to her solo career Grainne Duffy obtained a degree in music at NUI, Maynooth, Ireland and took part in session work singing with various bands across Italy and France. At Glastonbury Festival (Professional career 2007-2011) During 2007 Grainne Duffy embarked on her solo career. The same year she released her remarkable debut album “Out of the Dark” – proof talent that was rising at an impressive rate. The big success of the album led Duffy to play 3 days on the Acoustic Stage at Glastonbury Festival in UK (2008). The same year she performed support to major acts including Robben Ford and The Yardbirds. In 2009 BBC approached Duffy to record a track for a TV promotion campaign in George Martin’s Art Studio in London. Later in that year she appeared on the very popular Irish TV show “Other Voices” and receives huge admiration for her performance. This was followed up with her becoming an opening act to artists such as Little Feet and Paul Brady. 2010 marked her participation at leading blues festivals in Ireland such as Warrenpoint Blues Festival headlined by Van Morrison. During this year Duffy took an important step to expand her career forming the “Grainne Duffy Band” with her line-up consisting of Grainne Duffy (guitar, and vocals), Paul Sherry (guitar, backing vocals), Davy Watson (bass) and Gerry Morgan (drums) She also began to play festivals in the summer circuit in England where was warmly accepted. During 2011 Grainne Duffy released her second album “Test of Time” as a result of her collaboration with the producer Niko Bolas (Melissa Etheridge, Los Lobos). The album received rave reviews. The Sunday Times quoted this is “An Irish blues singer of real integrity”. Classic Rock Magazine featured her as an artist and reviewed the album saying ‘In this album Duffy is bringing soul to enhance her blues sound and Celtic roots experience. Worldwide recognition (Professional career 2012-2015)  The release of “Test of Time” and the accompanying official video to the title song further marked the development in a short time of Duffy’s reputation in the U.K. During 2012 she became an artist in high demand on the summer festival circuit in UK and began extensively touring in England. The first country outside of the U.K. which took notice of Duffy’s huge talent was Norway and in 2012 she appeared at the leading “Skanjevik Blues Festival” and later in October she played for first time the most northern festival worldwide “Dark Season Blues” in Svalbard – almost at the Arctic Pole. 2013 confirmed the growing reputation of Duffy and she began her first concerts on the European Continent with festivals in Bulgaria, Holland, France and Belgium. She also gained local recognition in Ireland headlining her home festival “Harvest Time Blues” in September in her native County Monaghan. In 2014 she continued this trend as she executed her first tour in Germany as well more tours in UK and Ireland. July saw Grainne earn huge success at Blue Balls Festival around Lake Luzern in Switzerland, also at one of the biggest festival in France “Cognac Blues Passion”. She also performed alongside some of the leading blues artists such as Keb’ Mo’ and Rival Sons at the biggest blues festival in Europe – “Notodden Blues Festival”. This was followed up with festivals in Italy and Holland. All of which leads to her deserved recognition, by the end of the year Duffy was voted “Best Vocalist” and “Best Artist” in the Blues Matters Writers Poll. In 2015 Duffy’s name is known already outside of Europe and during July she began touring for first time in Canada playing the leading “Tremblant International Festival”. After the tour “Maple Blues” calls Duffy “top artist. September saw her playing her 1st ever concert in Africa at “Tanjazz Festival” in Morocco. The same year the German label M2-Music releases the album “Grainne Duffy: Live” recorded while she had been on tour in Germany. She repeats the achievement from the previous year being voted again for “Best Artist” and “Best Female Vocalist” in Blues Matters Writers Poll for 2015. Current career (2016 – recently)  Such tours in Europe and Canada as well her leading festivals achieve great international success for Duffy with recognition for her as a stellar artist increasing across Europe. Spring 2016 sees Grainne recording an album with the producer and film composer Justin Stanley, known for his work with leading artists including Sheryl Crow, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck and working on the music to the very successful movies “Lost in Translation” and “Blow”. The session takes place in Los Angeles and includes collaborations with musicians such as Aaron Sterling, Shawn Davis, Doyle Bramhall II, Tyler Chester and Aaron Redfield. Such recordings are followed up festivals in Norway, Canada, Morocco, UK and Ireland. The end of 2016 see Duffy on tour for her first time in Australia at the well-known “Woodford Folk Festival”. February 2017 she is among the leading artists to be asked to take part in the renowned Mahindra Blues Festival in India sharing the stage with Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Lance Lopez (Supersonic Blues Machine), Shemika Copeland and the new arising guitar star Eric Gales for the final festival concert. In April 2017 Duffy released the single “Where I Belong” produced by Justin Stanley. The official video supporting the single becomes “choice of the week” of Vents Magazine, UK and Ditty TV in USA. During September Duffy released her long waited 3rd studio album with the same name – “Where I Belong”. The songs are composed by Duffy in collaboration with Paul Sherry and Justin Stanley. Her finely crafted lyrics are on full display on this release. The album achieves rave reviews in the specialized press Blues News Norway, Blues News Germany, Blues Matter UK and by many radio presenters in UK, including Bob Harris and Paul Jones from BBC. Duffy played a live session for the very popular Harris’s TV show “Under The Apple Tree” and conducts numerous interviews and live sessions for BBC broadcasts in London, Liverpool, Bristol, Scotland and Ulster. The album is officially released at a concert in “Nells Jazz & Blues Club”, London, with high praise reviews by “Blues in Britain” and “Get Ready To Rock” In the winter of 2018 Grainne Duffy performed a supports tour for Paul Carrack (Mike & The Mechanics) during his UK tour. Her performances enjoy wondrous success. “Midlands Rock Magazines” reviews her set in Birmingham and quotes: “A very talented individual who is trying to forge her way in the though musical world”; while Liverpool Acoustic does not hide the huge admiration exclaiming “that Ireland’s Grainne Duffy could come into the lives of the Liverpool audience and simply blow them away with her charm, depth and voice”.(Birmingham Review) In April 2018 Duffy recorded a live session for Keep it Country for Sky TV.

The DLA and MHC system are interchangeable terms in canines. The MHC plays a critical role in the immune response system and consists of three regions: class I, class II and class III. DLA genes belong to the first two classes, which are involved in the regulation of antigens in the immune system. The class II genes are highly polymorphic, with many different alleles/haplotypes that have been linked to diseases, allergies, and autoimmune conditions such as diabetes, polyarthritus, and hypothyroidism in canines. There are likely hundreds of immunologically relevant genes making up the DLA region in the canine genome; as of the present date the complete characteristics of the gene is unknown. MHC genes represent candidates for disease susceptibility in canines; some alleles promote protection against immune-mediated diseases and some increase susceptibility. For example, certain combinations of the DLA-DRB1 and DQ alleles are most favorable for good immune regulation. These alleles help balance immune surveillance and immune response without increasing the risk of developing an autoimmune condition. Different canine breeds have MHC/DLA allele association; these genes exhibit more inter-breed differentiation than intra-breed differentiation. Dogs have been selectively bred for different phenotypes, so the underlying genotypes and linked regions also differ among breeds. Selection on the DLA can lead to an increase in the prevalence of immune-mediated diseases. Due to selective breeding some breeds have become restricted in their DLA genes, with a limited subset of DLA alleles occurring within the breed. This explains some of the variation in immune responses among breeds. This occurs because there is a strong linkage disequilibrium that exists between DLA class II loci. The pattern displayed by the genetic differences among human ethnic groups is analogous to the pattern displayed by the distribution of DLA types in different canine breeds. MHC genes in humans are also known to be major contributors to autoimmune condition development.  Canine diabetes and DLA  In 1974 J. Nerup and others discovered that there is a link between diabetes and MHC genes. Dog leukocyte antigen has been found to be the genetic component associated with canine diabetes. The common alleles/haplotypes found in diabetes prone breeds (Samoyed, Carin Terrier, and Tibetan Terrier) are DLA DBR1*009, DQA1*001, and DQB1*008. The DLA DQA1 alleles code for an arginine amino acid at position 55 in region two, this increases the risk of developing diabetes in dog as arginine is a positive amino acid which can impair antigen binding. This allele is also associated with hypothyroidism which implies that this allele increases susceptibility for endocrinopathic immune-mediated diseases. It is possible that the link discovered between DLA associations and diabetes could be due to \\"makers\\" of susceptibility and that the true reason for susceptibility lies elsewhere in the genome. It could be associated with particular DLA alleles/haplotypes or caused by the strong linkage disequilibrium.  References  * Angles, J. M., Kennedy, L. J., & Pedersen, N. C. (2005).

His primary area of emphasis is modern and contemporary military history, from the French Revolution to the present. Education and career Wawro grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and as a boy delivered newspapers for the Hartford Courant. He received his diploma from the Loomis-Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut in 1978, and his A-levels in English Literature and German from Cheltenham College, in England, the following year. After receiving his bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Brown University (1983), he attended Yale University, where he received his Master of Arts in European history (1987), his M.

His dissertation, entitled \\"The Austro-Prussian War: Politics, Strategy and War in the Habsburg Monarchy, 1859-1866\\" (1992), supervised by Paul Kennedy, argued that the battle of Königgrätz (1866) was not so much won by the brilliance of the Prussian commander Helmuth von Moltke the Elder as it was lost by the incompetence of the Austrian commander Ludwig von Benedek.Wawro, curriculum vitae Accessed 14.06.2009.

Criticism In a review of Wawro's 1996 book on the Austro-Prussian War, Lawrence Sondhaus criticizes Wawro for falsely claiming that the Austrian Empire intended to destroy the Kingdom of Italy in the Third Italian War of Independence of 1866. Wawro gives no evidence for his thesis of Austrian aggression and then proceeds to lambaste the Austrians for not achieving \\"goals they never intended to pursue\\". Indeed, Wawro always portrays the Austrians as incompetent fools. Wawro also ignores Italy's \\"sweeping war aims\\"; her intentions of seizing Trieste, Istria, and Dalmatia, aims that were prevented by the Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa, and claims the Italians only wanted to acquire Venetia.

Robert Hildyard served as Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King Charles I of England and was a major-general in the King's army during the English Civil War. He took part in the Battle of Marston Moor. He was raised to a baronetcy by Charles II following the Restoration of the Monarchy. He was succeeded by his grandson Sir Robert Hildyard, 2nd Baronet, a Member of Parliament for Hedon. He was succeeded by his nephew, the third Baronet, who was Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn. The latter's son, the fourth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1783. On his death in 1814 the baronetcy became extinct. History The Hildyard family was a land owning family from Yorkshire, England. Winestead was among their primary estates. The earliest member of the family was Robert Hildyard of Normanby, who was living in 1109. Sir Robert Hildyard, son of Sir Christopher and Elizabeth (Welby) Hildyard, was created baronet, and was the ancestor of the Hildyard baronets.

At the time he served as a close adviser to paramount chief Opchanacanough (1554-1646). History Nemattanew first appears in English records in 1611, when George Percy mentioned 'Munetute' [sic] as being sent by paramount chief Wahunsunacawh, known as \\"Powhatan\\" to the English, to lead native resistance to the colonists' expansion in the upper James River region. This was when Henricus was founded, during the course of the First Anglo-Powhatan War. Percy notes that the English derisively called the leader \\"Jack-of-the-Feather,\\" on account of his native war regalia, remarking that \\"he used to come into the field all covered over with feathers and swans' wings fastened unto his shoulders, as though he meant to fly\\".A True Relation by George Percy (modernized spelling version) Because Nemattanew was never wounded in these skirmishes, he began to believe he was supernaturally invulnerable to musket- fire. He persuaded his fellow tribesmen of this attribute, enhancing his reputation with them. In the more peaceful times following the war, Nemattanew continued to play a prominent role. The English trained him to become a proficient musket shot. At one point in 1618, he raided the English settlement, capturing some guns, but these were returned by Chief Opchanacanough.Rountree 1990, p.69. In 1619, Opchanacanough sent him to propose that the English contribute eight to ten soldiers to accompany a Powhatan war party for an assault on a Siouan-speaking tribe above the Fall Line to avenge some Powhatan women they had slain. In return, the Powhatans would equally share all plundered captives, corn and territory with the English. This proposal was accepted by House of Burgesses; however, it failed to implement it by supplying the soldiers.Rountree 1990, p. 71.Natives and Newcomers By James Axtell, p. 253. A short time before the Indian massacre of 1622, in which the Powhatan attacked Henricus, Nemattanew appeared at the home of settler Morgan. He saw some trading-trinkets and proposed taking Morgan to Pamunkey to gain a good price. Morgan was never seen again. A few days later, Nemattanew showed up at the plantation and announced Morgan's death. As he was wearing Morgan's hat, settlers suspected the Native American might have killed the settler. They tried to force him to go with them to the nearest magistrate, he resisted, and one of the English fatally shot him. As Nemattanew lay dying, he begged to be buried behind English lines and not to reveal to his people that he had been felled by English fire. In England, John Smith, who had not been in Virginia since 1609, wrote in his 1624 Generall Historie of Nemattanew's death as occurring two weeks before the Henrico massacre. But 20th-century historian Rountree says, based on contemporary documents, particularly Council in Virginia, that it occurred no later than November 1621, while George Yeardley was still governor. This was five months before the massacre. There is some evidence in this document that by 1621, Nemattanew had fallen out of favor with Opchanacanough. Modern historians debate the nature of Nemattanew's true role in this event. They agree that the massacre was already being planned before he died, rather than being in reaction to his murder by the English colonists.

It has members in countries around the world - activists, politicians, professionals and academics, and is affiliated with national and local organisations. The IU enjoys Special Consultative Status at the United Nations. Principles The objectives of the IU are \\"to stimulate in all countries a public opinion favourable to permanent peace and prosperity for all people, through the progressive removal of the basic economic causes of poverty and war\\".Article II. IU Constitution, August 2005 (adopted and confirmed by the International Conference at St Andrews (1955) and amended most recently at Madrid (2004). The IU's work is guided by principles of equal freedom and sharing of common resources of community and nature - ideas most cogently set out in modern times in the writings of the 19th-century American reformer Henry George. Specifically, towards the realisation of its objectives, the IU \\"favours the raising of public revenues by public collection of the rental value of land apart from improvements\\"; and, further, favours \\"the abolition of taxes, tariffs, or imposts of every sort that interfere with the free production and exchange of wealth\\". Following from those principles the IU advances a radical land and fiscal reform agenda and 'real' free trade (i.e. that does not privilege Western corporate interests). The principal policies advocated by the IU are the public collection of 'resource rents' and land value taxation, in lieu of traditional taxation. Organisation The IU is governed by an Executive Committee of officers including Vice-Presidents from each sovereign state with significant representation within the membership, and other members. The IU is funded mainly by members' subscriptions, donations and legacies. The IU's work is supported by voluntary effort. History The IU was founded at an international conference held in Denmark in 1926. The conference was attended by some 500 delegates, all advocates of the ideas of Henry George. In 1992 the IU was accredited to the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). In 2003 it was granted Special Consultative Status by the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), which widened the scope of its engagement and influence in United Nations' processes. The IU retains 12 UN representatives who serve the world organisation's offices in New York, Geneva, Addis Ababa, Bangkok and Santiago. Since its founding, the IU has held periodic international conferences and published conference papers. Until recently, with the exception of its UN work, the IU's principal function was to provide a forum for land and tax reformers around the world to exchange ideas at conference. At its 2006 Conference, in London, the IU agreed it \\"shall transform itself into an active and outgoing professional organisation\\". Campaigns and publications At the Swanwick Conference in England in 1949 - as the United Nations was settling its Universal Declaration of Human Rights - the IU published a principle and policy pamphlet that later came to be known as its Declaration of Human Rights on Equal Freedom. This Declaration was translated into many languages, and subsequently amended and reaffirmed; most recently in 2001. In 2008 the IU launched a global online petition to reform the UDHR by amending its Articles 3 and 29 to include \\"a universal right to a place on earth\\". The IU is in the course of publishing the 'Economics of Abundance' series of monographs, written by the British economist Fred Harrison. The first volume, published in 2008, titled The Silver Bullet, deals with global poverty. Through its UN representatives the IU supports LVT implementation projects around the world, including South Africa, Nigeria and Vanuatu. The IU has contributed to the development of the Land Rights and Land Value Capture online course and training program created under the auspices of the UN's Global Land Tools Network. The IU has produced (2008) two documentary short films on human rights and poverty in southern Africa.

The screenplay is based on the epic two-part play The Revengers' Comedies by Alan Ayckbourn. The film had a brief and modestly successful theatrical run in Italy under the title Amori e vendette (Loves and Vendettas) but failed to find a distributor elsewhere. It eventually was telecast in the UK by BBC Two on 30 December, 1999, under the title The Revengers' Comedies. It was released on videotape in the United States and France and on DVD in the US.The Revengers' Comedies media at AlanAyckbourn.net Plot The plot, reminiscent of the Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers on a Train, focuses on two disparate characters. Conservative Henry Bell has been eased out of his job by condescending Bruce Tick, while wealthy and wildly eccentric Karen Knightly has been abandoned by her lover Anthony Staxton-Billing, who opted to return to his wife Imogen. Both are intent on committing suicide by leaping from the Tower Bridge in London. When neither succeeds, they strike a bargain whereby each agrees to exact revenge on behalf of the other, although Henry is less enthusiastic about the plan. Karen, disguised as a frumpy office temp, finds employment as an assistant to Tick and quickly derails his marriage by leading his wife Hilary to believe he's involved in an extramarital affair. Henry, meanwhile, is finding it difficult to keep his end of the bargain, since he has fallen in love with Imogen, the object of Karen's revenge. Instead of planning her demise, he begins an affair with the beguiling woman. Henry learns that Anthony left Karen not for Imogen, but for beautician Daphne Teal, and he begins to suspect Karen is more of a villain than a victim. The woman proves to be a formidable foe when she realizes Henry may renege on their deal. Adding to the humorous complications are Karen's oddball brother Oliver, who delights in racing through the interior of their rural mansion on his motor scooter; elderly and slightly befuddled housekeeper Winnie; and Daphne's very inept daughter Norma, who's being groomed to take over the household chores so Winnie finally can retire.

Marcus Production Rural scenes were filmed in Weston Turville in Buckinghamshire. Interiors were filmed at the Twickenham Film Studios in London. Critical reception David Rooney of Variety called the film a \\"mix of dry British wit, sophisticated farce and arch eccentricity,\\" \\"the kind of material that can sparkle onstage but often sits uneasily onscreen, and tends to have limited pull with today's audiences.\\" He added, \\"Aside from its humor, Ayckbourn's work is notable for its brisk pacing, multilateral action and the ingenuity of its complex structuring, all qualities that lose something in the screen transfer...Mowbray's script opens out the action physically but is unable to shake off the stagy feel. To his credit, he never shies away from the savagery that flavors the best black comedies, but the verve needed to make this one a complete success is nonetheless missing.\\"Variety review References External links  Category:1998 films Category:1998 comedy films Category:British comedy films Category:British films Category:British films about revenge Category:Films directed by Malcolm Mowbray Category:British films based on plays Category:Films scored by Alexandre Desplat ","title":"Sweet Revenge (1998 film)"},{"id":"20029419","text":"Philip and His Wife is a novel by the American writer Margaret Deland (1857–1945) set in the 19th century fictional locale of Old Chester, a Western Pennsylvania rural village near Pittsburgh.

Retrieved 6 December 2008. He is well known for his paintings, sculpture, ink drawings, works on paper, and artist's books. Life and work Gimblett was born in Auckland, New Zealand, a second- generation New Zealander. Gimblett attended King's School and Auckland Grammar School in 1950, and left New Zealand in 1956 to travel throughout Europe until 1961, with a brief return to Auckland for a year in 1958–59. Traveling to the Americas in 1962, Gimblett apprenticed with master potter Roman Bartkiw in Toronto, Canada and then worked with master ceramist Merton Chambers from 1962 to 1964. In 1964 he married Barbara Kirshenblatt. That same year he studied drawing at the Ontario College of Art, Toronto. In 1965 he studied painting at the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California. From 1967 to 1970, he lived and painted in Bloomington, Indiana where Barbara Kirshenblatt- Gimblett was completing her PhD in Folklore Studies. From 1970 to 1972 he resided in Austin, Texas, where Barbara was an associate professor in the English department at the University of Texas, Austin. Gimblett moved to New York in 1972 and in 1974 formed an affinity and enduring friendship with the experimental filmmaker and kinetic sculptor Len Lye, who was a fellow New Zealander. Gimblett continued to support his work after Lye's death and in 1990 he became a trustee of the Len Lye Foundation based in New Plymouth, New Zealand. Gimblett continued to live in New York returning to New Zealand only for brief visits. In 1979 Gimblett became an American Citizen. Gimblett's work is rich and inventive. He is known for his great technical and stylistic range: the monochrome, geometric abstraction, the calligraphic and figurative expressionism all find a place in the work. He uses novel shaped supports: ovals, circles, and rings. However the quatrefoil is the shape he has really made his own. \\"The quatrefoil is defined ...\\" writes Thomas McEvilley, \\"as 'a compound leaf or flower consisting of four (usually rounded) leaflets or petals radiating from a common center.' Most of Gimblett’s works in this format are geometrised, meaning that the petals of the flowers are not merely rounded in an organic sense but are composed of four perfect circles that intersect at a single point. It is a format which virtually no other modern artist has emphasized.\\"McEvilley, Thomas. The Brush of All Things, The Transition from Three to Four, Auckland Art Gallery, Toi o Tamaki, Auckland, New Zealand. Page 10. Gimblett draws freely on Buddhism, Christianity, classical mythology, and alchemy, Jung. His work can be understood in the context of Western Buddhism. \\"The Influence of Zen,\\" writes Thomas McEvilley, \\"for example, seems natural to Gimblett, and carries with it an echo of Asia’s proximity to New Zealand, but also can be traced partly to American artists with West Coast connections such as Clyfford Still and Mark Tobey. Gimblett has made a harmonious post-war synthesis of America and Japan.\\"McEvilley, Thomas. The Brush of All Things, The Transition from Three to Four, Auckland Art Gallery, Toi o Tamaki, Auckland, New Zealand. Page 9. Gimblett's first solo painting exhibition was at Dave Hickey's A Clean Well Lighted Place in Austin in 1971. In 1975 he joined the Cuningham Ward Gallery, New York where he exhibited with Ross Bleckner, John Walker, David Reed, John Elderfield, and Lynton Wells. In 1989 he was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Painting Fellowship. In 1990 Gimblett joined the Haines Gallery, San Francisco and the Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland. Both of these galleries continue to represent him today. In 1991 he participated in a residency at The Rockefeller Foundation, Study and Conference Center, Bellagio, Lake Como, Italy. Gimblett was a J. Paul Getty associate at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, Santa Monica, in 1991–1992. Craig Potton Publishing published his first monograph in 2002 in association with Gow Langsford Gallery (Auckland), which includes essays by John Yau and Wystan Curnow. \\"Max Gimblett: The Brush of All Things\\", a major survey of his work, opened at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi O Tamaki, Auckland, New Zealand in 2004 and traveled to the City Gallery, Wellington. Thomas McEvilley and Wystan Curnow contributed essays to the catalog, which also contained an interview with Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. \\"Here is how it happened. Gimblett stepped up to the 80-inch circular canvas and while that murderous train bore down on him, he painted The Wheel in less than one minute. This is no exaggeration, in on rapturous, fearless moment, which left him with time to spare.\\" Wystan Curnow describes Gimblett painting The Wheel, an Enso, in his essay An Exhilaration of the Spirit, in Max Gimblett, monograph, 2002, published by Craig Potton Publishing in association with Gow Langsford Gallery, also including an essay by John Yau. In January 2006 Max Gimblett took refuge in the precepts of Buddha. \\"Gimblett’s absorption in Asian art connects him to three unique figures in American art: Morris Graves, John McLaughlin, and Ad Reinhardt,\\" writes Yau, \\"One reason Gimblett shares a deep connection with these three seminal figures is because all of them embarked upon an intense and prolonged study of different schools of Buddhism and Buddhist art.\\" He was appointed to the honorary position of Visiting Professor of Art to the National Institute of Creative Arts and Industries, Auckland University, Auckland, New Zealand in 2003. Gimblett was the Laila Foundation Artist in Residence at HuiPress, Maui, HI in July 2008, making a suite of Enso etchings. His work was included in the Guggenheim Museum's exhibition titled \\"The Third Mind: American Artists Contemplate Asia, 1860 to 1989\\" which was open from 30 January to 19 April 2009. The exhibition was curated by Alexandra Munroe, the museum's first Senior Curator of Asian Art. For ANZAC's 100th Anniversary, he created the \\"Art of Remembrance\\"http://www.rememberthem.nz/about-the-project/ public art - solid brass quatrefoil to represent each Kiwi soldier that served in WW1 - on the exterior of St. David's on Kyber Pass in Auckland. Versions of \\"Art of Remembrance\\" have been installed at Te Papa and The Auckland War Memorial Museum (where \\"Tower of Remembrance\\" it is a part of the collection and on permanent display). He was named an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to art in the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours. On 26 October 2017, Gimblett received an honorary doctorate from the University of Waikato for his philanthropy and achievements in the artistic world. Gimblett has collaborated with a number of other artists including Warwick Freeman, Lewis Hyde, Judith Ivory, Matt Jones (artist), Win Knowlton, Alan Loney, Chris Martin, Eileen Tabios, Michael Dai Ryu Wenger Great Dragon, and John Yau.

Although he won easy reelection in 1990, McCorquodale lost his seat in 1994 to Dick Monteith a conservative Republican businessman. The fact that his senate district had been shifted from his home base of San Jose into the more conservative Central Valley after reapportionment proved too much of a burden for McCorquodale.

The CSR is one of the oldest caving groups in Italy. Its activity has contributed to the birth and the increase of the Italian Speleology History The Circolo Speleologico Romano (CSR) was founded on the 5th of July 1904 by Guido Cora, the illustrious geographer and brave mountain climber, Baron Carlo Franchetti, Alessandro Datti and others. Immediately the CSR established relationships with other European groups, especially Swiss, French and Belgium sharing the exploration of the Abruzzo region (Luppa’s cave, Val de Varri’s Cave) and in France. The first major exploration campaigns outside Italy, of the Anatolia caves, began after the First World War leading to important biological discoveries. In this period the bio- speleological activity received a strong acceleration especially due to the two associates Patrizi and Cerruti. More than 200 new species of troglobites carry the name of CSR associates. Since the beginning of the exploration activity all the data collected about each cave has been organized in the cave cadastre. In the 90s the regional cave cadastre was passed to the Federazione speleologica del Lazio. In 1924 the club published its first bulletin, detailing the explorations and the scientific activities of its associates. This bulletin (renamed Notiziario del Circolo Speleologico Romano in 1946) is exchanged with the publications of similar organizations in more than 40 nations around the world, continually expanding the social library of the association. In 1954 for its merits in scientific field, to the fulfilment of its 50 year of activity, the CSR was named \\"Ente Morale\\" by decree of the President of the Italian Republic Luigi Einaudi. In the 1960s the CSR began to mount large international expeditions (1962 Gouffre Berger in France, 1963 in Lebanon, in 1964 Ojo Guareña in Spain and then Poland, Turkey, Albania. Since 1969 its research in Chiapas (southern Mexico) has been particularly relevant, where it has explored and surveyed more than 60 km of new caves. The bio- speleological results of these activities are published in three volumes of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei with the title “Subterranean Fauna of Mexico”. To commemorate the 100th year of activity of the Circolo Speleologico Romano Poste Italiane has produced a special stamp in 3.5 million of pieces.

History The band formed in May 1965, although it had its roots back in September 1963 when Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel both entered Charterhouse. Both of them did not like the school for their first year there, and as arriving at the same time, they stuck together throughout the first year. It did not take long for them to discover their common passion of music. This led the two of them to going into the nearby towns and villages and listening to whatever music would be playing in the record stores at the time. The two of them were members of the Duckites house at Charterhouse, and there was a piano in the main hall which they used to go and play on. These occasions in the main hall were the first musical collaborations between Banks and Gabriel.Gallo, Armando (1980). Genesis: I Know What I Like. DIY Books. During his time at Charterhouse, Peter Gabriel had been drumming for an R & B band called \\"The Spoken Word\\", and another band called \\"Millords\\".Genesis Early Years Event 2005 - Richard Macphail Interview (3). genesis-news.com, 15 May 2005. Retrieved on 27 May 2007. As a result of his time in this band, Gabriel started songwriting with Banks. The first song the two of them ever wrote together eventually evolved into a track called 'She Is Beautiful', and eventually became known as 'The Serpent' (released on Genesis' debut album From Genesis to Revelation, in 1969). In May 1965, when future Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips had joined the school, a five-piece band called Anon had come into existence. It was around this time that Gabriel and Banks got together with Phillips' friend Chris Stewart (who was not a member of Anon), and together they formed a three-piece band featuring Gabriel on vocals, Banks on piano, and Stewart on drums. This band named itself Garden Wall. The band simply carried on like this, playing covers and new songs that Banks and Gabriel were writing together. In December 1965, Garden Wall played their only concert, on a stage inside Charterhouse School on a double bill with Anon. Gabriel showered the audience with rose petals that he had spent the afternoon picking, this was to be the first of his famous onstage antics.Gallo, Armando (1980). Genesis: I Know What I Like. DIY Books. Garden Wall's fellow band splintered at this point, with two of the members leaving in the summer and a third member leaving towards the end of the year.

It was a co-production between the Open University and the BBC and aired in October 2008 on BBC Four. The material was written and presented by University of Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy.Guardian interview The consultants were the Open University academics Robin Wilson, professor Jeremy Gray and June Barrow-Green. Kim Duke is credited as series producer.To Infinity and Beyond 27 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four The series comprised four programmes respectively titled: The Language of the Universe; The Genius of the East; The Frontiers of Space; and To Infinity and Beyond. Du Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven Riemann hypothesis, a 150-year-old problem for whose solution the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1,000,000 prize. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the world's science, technology, and culture. He starts his journey in ancient Egypt and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. Between he travels through Babylon, Greece, India, China, and the medieval Middle East. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians. \\"The Language of the Universe\\" In this opening programme Marcus du Sautoy looks at how important and fundamental mathematics is to our lives before looking at the mathematics of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. Du Sautoy commences in Egypt where recording the patterns of the seasons and in particular the flooding of the Nile was essential to their economy. There was a need to solve practical problems such as land area for taxation purposes.BBC Four; The Language of the Universe; 9:00 pm 6 October 2008 Du Sautoy discovers the use of a decimal system based on the fingers on the hands, the unusual method for multiplication and division. He examines the Rhind Papyrus, the Moscow Papyrus and explores their understanding of binary numbers, fractions and solid shapes. He then travels to Babylon and discovered that the way we tell the time today is based on the Babylonian 60 base number system. So because of the Babylonians we have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. He then shows how the Babylonians used quadratic equations to measure their land. He deals briefly with Plimpton 322. In Greece, the home of ancient Greek mathematics, he looks at the contributions of some of its greatest and well known mathematicians including Pythagoras, Plato, Euclid, and Archimedes, who are some of the people who are credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today. A controversial figure, Pythagoras’ teachings were considered suspect and his followers seen as social outcasts and a little be strange and not in the norm. There is a legend going around that one of his followers, Hippasus, was drowned when he announced his discovery of irrational numbers. As well as his work on the properties of right angled triangles, Pythagoras developed another important theory after observing musical instruments. He discovered that the intervals between harmonious musical notes are always in whole number intervals.OpenLearn: The Language of the Universe; accessed 12 March 2014 It deals briefly with Hypatia of Alexandria. \\"The Genius of the East\\" With the decline of ancient Greece, the development of maths stagnated in Europe. However the progress of mathematics continued in the East. Du Sautoy describes both the Chinese use of maths in engineering projects and their belief in the mystical powers of numbers. He mentions Qin Jiushao. He describes Indian mathematicians’ invention of trigonometry; their introduction of a symbol for the number zero and their contribution to the new concepts of infinity and negative numbers. It shows Gwalior Fort where zero is inscribed on its walls. It mentions the work of Brahmagupta and Bhāskara II on the subject of zero. He mentions Madhava of Sangamagrama and Aryabhata and illustrates the - historically first exact - formula for calculating the π (pi).BBC documentary \\"The Story of Maths\\", second part, showing a visualization of the historically first exact formula, starting at 35 min and 20 sec into the second part of the documentary. Du Sautoy then considers the Middle East: the invention of the new language of algebra and the evolution of a solution to cubic equations. He talks about the House of Wisdom with Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī and he visits University of Al-Karaouine. He mentions Omar Khayyám. Finally he examines the spread of Eastern knowledge to the West through mathematicians such as Leonardo Fibonacci, famous for the Fibonacci sequence.OpenLearn: The Genius of the East; accessed 12 March 2014 He mentions Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia. \\"The Frontiers of Space\\" From the seventeenth century, Europe replaced the Middle East as the engine house of mathematical ideas. Du Sautoy visits Urbino to introduce perspective using mathematician and artist, Piero della Francesca's The Flagellation of Christ.The Frontiers of Space 20 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four Du Sautoy proceeds to describes René Descartes realisation that it was possible to describe curved lines as equations and thus link algebra and geometry. He talks with Henk J. M. Bos about Descartes. He shows how one of Pierre de Fermat’s theorems is now the basis for the codes that protect credit card transactions on the internet. He describes Isaac Newton’s development of math and physics crucial to understanding the behaviour of moving objects in engineering. He covers the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy and the Bernoulli family. He further covers Leonhard Euler, the father of topology, and Gauss' invention of a new way of handling equations, modular arithmetic. He mentions János Bolyai. The further contribution of Gauss to our understanding of how prime numbers are distributed is covered thus providing the platform for Bernhard Riemann's theories on prime numbers. In addition Riemann worked on the properties of objects, which he saw as manifolds that could exist in multi-dimensional space.OpenLearn: The Frontiers of Space; accessed 12 March 2014 \\"To Infinity and Beyond\\" =Hilbert's first problem= The final episode considers the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. On 8 August 1900 David Hilbert gave a historic talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Hilbert posed twenty-three then unsolved problems in mathematics which he believed were of the most immediate importance. Hilbert succeeded in setting the agenda for 20thC mathematics and the programme commenced with Hilbert's first problem. Georg Cantor considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... ∞ which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... ∞. Cantor showed that these two infinite sets of numbers actually had the same size as it was possible to pair each number up; 1 - 10, 2 - 20, 3 - 30 ... etc. If fractions now are considered there are an infinite number of fractions between any of the two whole numbers, suggesting that the infinity of fractions is bigger than the infinity of whole numbers. Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - 1/1; 2 - 2/1; 3 - 1/2 ... etc. through to ∞; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size. But when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others. However, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals? Cantor believed, in what became known as the Continuum Hypothesis, that there is no such set. This would be the first problem listed by Hilbert. =Poincaré conjecture= Next Marcus discusses Henri Poincaré's work on the discipline of 'Bendy geometry'. If two shapes can be moulded or morphed to each other's shape then they have the same topology. Poincaré was able to identify all possible two-dimensional topological surfaces; however in 1904 he came up with a topological problem, the Poincaré conjecture, that he could not solve; namely what are all the possible shapes for a 3D universe. According to the programme, the question was solved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman who linked the problem to a different area of mathematics. Perelman looked at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape. This enabled him to find all the ways that 3D space could be wrapped up in higher dimensions. =David Hilbert= The achievements of David Hilbert were now considered. In addition to Hilbert's problems, Hilbert space, Hilbert Classification and the Hilbert Inequality, du Sautoy highlights Hilbert's early work on equations as marking him out as a mathematician able to think in new ways. Hilbert showed that, while there were an infinity of equations, these equations could be constructed from a finite number of building block like sets. Hilbert could not construct that list of sets; he simply proved that it existed. In effect Hilbert had created a new more abstract style of Mathematics. =Hilbert's second problem= For 30 years Hilbert believed that mathematics was a universal language powerful enough to unlock all the truths and solve each of his 23 Problems. Yet, even as Hilbert was stating We must know, we will know, Kurt Gödel had shattered this belief; he had formulated the Incompleteness Theorem based on his study of Hilbert's second problem: :This statement cannot be proved Using a code based on prime numbers, Gödel was able to transform the above into a pure statement of arithmetic. Logically, the above cannot be false and hence Gödel had discovered the existence of mathematical statements that were true but were incapable of being proved. =Hilbert's first problem revisited= In 1950s American mathematician Paul Cohen took up the challenge of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which asks \\"is there is or isn't there an infinite set of number bigger than the set of whole numbers but smaller than the set of all decimals\\". Cohen found that there existed two equally consistent mathematical worlds. In one world the Hypothesis was true and there did not exist such a set. Yet there existed a mutually exclusive but equally consistent mathematical proof that Hypothesis was false and there was such a set. Cohen would subsequently work on Hilbert's eighth problem, the Riemann hypothesis, although without the success of his earlier work. =Hilbert's tenth problem= Hilbert's tenth problem asked if there was some universal method that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not. The growing belief was that no so such method was possible yet the question remained, how could you prove that, no matter how ingenious you were, you would never come up with such a method. He mentions Paul Cohen. To answer this Julia Robinson, who created the Robinson Hypothesis which stated that to show that there was no such method all you had to do was cook up one equation whose solutions were a very specific set of numbers: The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially yet still be captured by the equations at the heart of Hilbert's problem. Robinson was unable to find this set. This part of the solution fell to Yuri Matiyasevich who saw how to capture the Fibonacci sequence using the equations at the heart of Hilbert's tenth. =Algebraic geometry= The final section briefly covers algebraic geometry. Évariste Galois had refined a new language for mathematics. Galois believed mathematics should be the study of structure as opposed to number and shape. Galois had discovered new techniques to tell whether certain equations could have solutions or not. The symmetry of certain geometric objects was the key. Galois' work was picked up by André Weil who built algebraic geometry, a whole new language. Weil's work connected number theory, algebra, topology and geometry. Finally du Sautoy mentions Weil's part in the creation of the fictional mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki and another contributor to Bourbaki's output - Alexander Grothendieck.

In 1949, at the age of 20, Albrecht earned his shot at the majors by having a record-breaking season in what was then the Class C Cotton States League. Pitching for the Pine Bluff Judges, Albrecht won 29 games and struck out 389 batters, both all-time records for the league. The Browns called him up to make a start for them on the last day of the season, in which he earned his one and only major league win. Albrecht pitched in two games for the Browns in 1950 before returning to the minors, retiring in 1953.

He was killed at 10:59 a.m., about one minute before the Armistice was to take effect at 11:00 a.m. Gunther had recently been demoted, and was seeking to regain his rank just before the war ended.  Early life  Henry Gunther was born into a German-American family in east Baltimore, Maryland, on June 6, 1895. His parents, George Gunther (1869-1919) and Lina Roth (1866-1938), were both children of German immigrants. He grew up in Highlandtown, an East Baltimore neighborhood heavily influenced by German immigrants,Persico, p. 134. where his family belonged to Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic parish. Henry Gunther worked as a bookkeeper and clerk at the National Bank of Baltimore. He had joined the Roman Catholic service order for laymen, the Knights of Columbus, in 1915.  Military service  Being of recent German-American heritage, Gunther did not automatically enlist in the armed forces as many others did soon after the War was declared in April 1917. In September 1917, he was drafted and quickly assigned to the 313th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed \\"Baltimore's Own\\"; it was part of the larger 157th Brigade of the 79th Infantry Division. Promoted as a supply sergeant, he was responsible for clothing in his military unit, and arrived in France in July 1918 as part of the incoming American Expeditionary Forces. A critical letter home, in which he reported on the \\"miserable conditions\\" at the front and advised a friend to try anything to avoid being drafted, was intercepted by the Army postal censor. As a result, he was demoted from sergeant back down to a private. Gunther's unit, Company 'A', arrived at the Western Front on September 12, 1918. Like all Allied units on the front of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, it was still embroiled in fighting on the morning of November 11.Persico, pp. 134-135. The Armistice with Germany was signed by 5:00 a.m., local time, but it would not come into force until 11:00 a.m. Gunther's squad approached a roadblock of two German machine guns in the village of Chaumont- devant-Damvillers near Meuse, in Lorraine. Gunther got up, against the orders of his close friend and now sergeant, Ernest Powell, and charged with his bayonet. The German soldiers, already aware of the Armistice that would take effect in one minute, tried to wave Gunther away. He kept going and fired \\"a shot or two\\". When he got too close to the machine guns, he was shot in a short burst of automatic fire and killed instantly.Persico, p. 351. The writer James M. Cain, then a reporter for the local daily newspaper, The Sun, interviewed Gunther's comrades afterward and wrote that \\"Gunther brooded a great deal over his recent reduction in rank, and became obsessed with a determination to make good before his officers and fellow soldiers\\". American Expeditionary Forces commanding General John J. Pershing's \\"Order of The Day\\" on the following day specifically mentioned Gunther as the last American killed in the war. The Army posthumously restored his rank of sergeant and awarded him a Divisional Citation for Gallantry in Action and the Distinguished Service Cross. Several years later, a post, number 1858 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in east Baltimore, was named after him.Persico, p. 394. The VFW Post honoring the name of Sergeant Gunther has since ceased to exist. Gunther's remains were returned to the United States in 1923 after being exhumed from a military cemetery in France, and buried at the Most Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Baltimore. Subsequent investigations revealed that on the last day of World War I, between the beginning of the armistice negotiations in the railroad cars encampment at the Compiegne Forest, French commander-in- chief Marshal Foch refused to accede to the German negotiators' immediate request to declare a ceasefire or truce so that there would be no more useless waste of lives among the common soldiers. By not declaring a truce even between the signing of the documents for the Armistice and its entry into force, \\"at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\\", about 11,000 additional men were wounded or killed – far more than usual, according to the military statistics.Persico, p. 378.  Memorials  Commemorative plaque at the grave of Henry Gunther in Most Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Baltimore, unveiled on November 11, 2010. Note the misspelling of \\"Meuse\\". On \\"Veterans Day\\" (in France, \\"Armistice Day\\"), November 11, 2008, a memorial was constructed near the place in Chaumont-devant-Damvillers in Lorraine where Gunther died. Two years later on the same remembrance holiday observance, November 11, 2010, a memorial plaque was also unveiled at his grave site in America at 10:59 a.m. by the German Society of Maryland.  Books and film  French author Roger Faindt wrote in 2009 a historical/biographical book about Gunther, 10h59. It is being adapted into an English language film titled 10h59, scheduled to begin shooting in 2013 with a budget of 12 million euros.
