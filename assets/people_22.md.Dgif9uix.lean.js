He served in Action T4 and later as the second and last commandant of Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp during Operation Reinhard. Hering directly perpetrated the genocide of Jews and other peoples during The Holocaust. Early life Hering was born and raised in Warmbronn, a district in the town of Leonberg. After finishing his schooling, Hering worked on a farm near his home. From 1907 to 1909, he served in the 20th (2nd W√ºrttemberg) Uhlans \\"King William I\\" regiment, and then voluntarily stayed on for another three years. Hering then joined the Heilbronn police in 1912. In 1914, Hering married and had one son. During the First World War, Hering was called to serve in the machine gun company of Grenadier Regiment 123 in 1915, with which he fought on the Western Front in northern France until the armistice in 1918. He attained the rank of sergeant. For his war services he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. After the First World War, Hering briefly rejoined the Schutzpolizei in Heilbronn. Police and SS career Hering began his police career in 1919 as a detective (sergeant) in the criminal police (Kriminalpolizei, or Kripo) in G√∂ppingen, near Stuttgart, making officer rank by 1929. In 1920, Hering had joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. During the Weimar Republic era he initiated vigorous actions against the NSDAP, SA and SS and consequently was called a \\"Nazi-eater\\". By the 1933 Nazi Seizure of Power (\\"Machtergreifung\\"), Nazi Party members vehemently demanded Hering's dismissal from the police. However, Hering had known Nazi Christian Wirth from official contexts since 1912, and while working in the Kripo in Stuttgart, the two became acquaintances, so that Hering was able to continue working despite the violent protests of local SA and SS men. In May 1933 Hering finally joined the NSDAP. In 1934 he was appointed head of the G√∂ppingen Kripo and then continued his career in 1939 in Stuttgart- Schwenningen. After the outbreak of World War II, Hering, along with other senior Kripo officers, was transferred to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in December 1939. He was appointed with the task of resettling Volksdeutsche to the General Government. Action T4 Beginning in late 1940, Hering held various functions within the Action T4 \\"euthanasia\\" program. Having completed the order at Gdynia, he was transferred to work first at Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre. Hering served as an assistant supervisor (as did Fritz Tauscher) to a police officer by the name of Schemel. After Sonnenstein, Hering became the office manager at Hartheim Euthanasia Centre.Henry Friedlander (1995). The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 206-207. He also worked in the special registry offices of Bernburg and Hadamar euthanasia centres. Operation Reinhard After Action T4, Hering was posted briefly to the Sicherheitsdienst in Prague in June 1942, and was then transferred to Operation Reinhard in Lublin, Poland. He replaced Christian Wirth as commandant of Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp at the end of August 1942. He served as the camp's commandant until its closure in .Gottlieb Hering, holocausthistoricalsociety.org.uk Rudolf Reder, one of the very few survivors of Be≈Ç≈ºec, wrote of Hering's role in the killing of Jews.Rudolf Reder on Gottlieb Hering.

It is a laid finish paper of light to medium weight, and it is not as strong or as durable as Bristol paper. Laid finish refers to the imprint of regular screen pattern of a papermaker's mould. Ingres is not necessarily a handmade paper, but is produced to replicate the properties of laid paper. Ingres is often used for charcoal and pastel drawing. It is also used as an endpaper in books. The development of ingres paper for drawing is ascribed to the French Neoclassical artist Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), although modern ingres papers can differ from those actually used by Ingres. Important is that the pattern is a laid mesh. The laid effect creates a toothy grain of close lines on one side and a mottled surface on the reverse. The toothiness allows the paper to take charcoal easily and evenly. Ingres paper is favored in book arts for its antique appearance and pH neutrality. Prominent manufactures include Canson, Hahnem√ºhle (sometimes called \\"German Ingres\\"), and Fabriano. Ingres paper has a high rag content (around 65%) and is gelatin sized.

He wrote a diary which gives a unique historic record of the life in the contemporary army from the viewpoint of a simple Landsknecht. Current research relates the book author to Peter Hagendorf, first principal of G√∂rzke, who died on 4 February 1679 at age of 77. As such he was probably born in 1601 or 1602 in the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst near Nedlitz.  History  His writings were found by chance in 1988 in the manuscript store of the Berlin State Library. The surviving part covers a range of 25 years between 1625 and 1649. The book was folded from 12 sheets of paper which he bought at the end of the war in 1648 to write a fair copy of his notes. The 192 pages tell of a 22,500 km long journey across Europe filled with battles in Italy, the German states, Spanish Netherlands and France. He took part in the Sack of Magdeburg (the devastation was so great that \\"magdeburgization\\" became an oft-used term signifying total destruction, rape and pillaging for decades) and the Battle of N√∂rdlingen (1634).Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 283-4, 288-9. He details a life on the verge of death which includes his first wife and seven of his children. The diary was anonymous. However the author had written down the dates and places of the birth of his daughters and where his wife came from. As for one proof the diary says that his daughter Magreta was born on 3. November 1645 in Pappenheim and by chance the church register of that town had survived the war. It has an entry for an Anna Marget on that day with a mother named Anna Maria (equivalent with his wife's name) denoting Peter Hagendorf as the father. Other sources support the notion, for example the first church register (1629‚Äì1635) of Engelrod (Lautertal) has the following christening entry: ‚ÄûEichelhain, Anno 1629, August 17., Elisabeth, Peter Hagendorffs, eines Soldaten von Zerbst D√∂chterlein ...‚Äú Near the given origin Zerbst exists even a locality named Hagendorf. Based on Hagendorf's writing it is now known that many women and children followed in the baggage train, how the division of responsibilities was organized between men and wife in the army camp, how the treatment of wounds was organized, how sieges were announced and how the sack (looting) of an overpowered city took place. Hagendorf fought for the most part in Pappenheim's regiment. It lay there until being discovered by Jan Peters in 1988, an East German professor at the time. Peter Hagendorf expresses mixed feelings towards the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. He had basically lost his job which required him to work now as a night guard, and to take up other unskilled work. Without giving a reason, he picks up his son from the probst, travelling with his family northeast through √ñttingen. His last location is G√ºnzburg when the diary stops - the last three pages are missing.  After 1649  Professor , who had published a transcribed version of the book in 1993, had already indicated that the language points to a Rhinelandic origin (in today's western Germany). That may contradict the designation of Zerbst in the christening entry (in today's eastern Germany) however further research revealed that the Fl√§ming Heath was dominated by settlers from the Rhine regions at the time. The Fl√§ming region is in the north-east of the historic Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst - the region was later amalgamated into Prussia taking over its language from the Potsdam- Berlin area. Churchbook entry of G√∂rzke, telling of the baptism the son Peter of \\"Peter Hagendorf, ein Soldat (a soldier)\\" highlighted in red Later research had focused on the question where the book author may have gained his knowledge in writing as well as Latin. Apart from the Francisceum Zerbst the region had schools in Bad Belzig and Wiesenburg. Faith schools for sacristans are known for Grubo and G√∂rzke as their pastors were also recorded as school principals. While checking the church register, the death note for Peter Hagendorf was discovered. There is a valid interpretation that the mercenary was returning to his old homeland after the wars - according to the registers in G√∂rzke he baptized his son Peter, on 9. November 1649 along with his family. Multiple notes in the G√∂rzke registers state his wife's name as \\"Anna Maria Hagendorf\\" which is consistent with the name of his second wife in the mercenary's book. Moreover, the civil registers showed that his children survived and four more sons were born from where two reached the adult age. All get married, so that along the heritage lines some offspring live in modern times. The registers show a number of people in the area with the family name Hagendorf however the village Hagendorf had no recordings of that name later than the 16th century. This may be a result of a plague epidemic between 1400 and 1610 where most of the inhabitants moved to Grubo. Grubo deserted around 1640 with the villagers moving to G√∂rzke. That history along with godmother and godfather entries of an Anna and her father Martin Hagendorf, there is a theory that Peter had relatives in G√∂rzke upon returning. It may also explain how he did become mayor already in 1650, holding also other principal positions until his death decades later. While Nedlitz is part of the Anhalt principality, it happens that G√∂rzke is part of Prussia's Brandenburg dominions. Both villages are roughly 20 km apart, G√∂rzke being to the northeast. The local probst and book lover Gottlieb Ernst Schmid (1727‚Äì1814) had assembled a large library throughout his life time. It was donated to the Prussian state library in Berlin in 1803 with the diary being a part of it. It was found there in 1988 by Jan Peters who did recognize the importance for the science of history. The fame has grown over the years leading up to a TV documentary in 2011 where Peter Hagendorf was pictured in Der Drei√üigj√§hrige Kriege (Teil 1) ‚Äì Von Feldherren, S√∂ldnern und Karrieristen.

Supported by three release shows, it was released on November 11, 2008, alongside Here, Hear II. through No Sleep Records on both CD and vinyl. The album's title is derived from an Asian folktale, which the album's lyrics loosely follow. The album was well received reviews by notable critics and maintains a legacy in the post- hardcore scene. Recording and release La Dispute had spent the year prior to the release of the album writing and recording. They recorded the album in Grand Rapids at StudiOtte with Joel and Troy Otte and had finished the recording by July 2008. The album was released November 11, 2008, through No Sleep records, a record label to which La Dispute had only signed a few months prior. To promote the release of the album, the band played three release shows in their home state of Michigan: November 8 at Skelletones, November 14 at the UAW Retirees Hall in Traverse City, and November 22 at the Howell Opera House in Howell. The vinyl press was limited to 1000 copies: 500 each in Brown/Black and Clear/Black. The album has received a total of 10 pressings. Themes and styles The album evades categorization, containing elements of post-hardcore, screamo, metalcore, post-rock, progressive rock and emo. The album's style is characterised by different features, including dub-influenced bass drums and versatile vocals from Jordan Dreyer, who changes frequently, ranging from shouted hardcore punk styled vocals and screams, to spoken word portions and intentional use of off-key singing. Lyrically, the album features many themes of emotional anguish and is considered ultra-emotional; its emotions range though pain, rage, and anger and deals with loss considerably. The album recounts the Asian folk tale of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, a story of how a prince and a princess are separated after marriage by a river which they are not allowed to cross. Prior to the release of this album, the story was told on the fourth track from La Dispute's second EP, Here, Hear. However, when vocalist Jordan Dreyer has been asked in interviews about the lyrical concept of the album, he has stated that although it does contain thematic constants it does not actually tell a story and is more autobiographical and the folk tale was used as more of a \\"jumping-off point\\" for similar personal struggles. The real-life connotations of the record's lyrics are that of two divorces of people related to Dreyer. The first song on the album, \\"Such Small Hands\\", a spoken word track which is seen to \\" build to seemingly uncontrollable levels\\". Drummer Brad Vander Lugt commented on its surprising popularity, saying: ‚ÄúWe cannot figure it out! It‚Äôs just an intro to the record, I have no idea why people have clung to it so much... It‚Äôs funny, we don‚Äôt even count it as a song!‚Äù \\"Bury Your Flame\\" is seen as \\"a perfect fusion of blues, post-rock and hardcore\\". Reception The album is a popular release of No Sleep Records as it has received ten pressings on vinyl for a total of 8,280 copies. All eight pressings combined is a total of 6400 sales of the album on vinyl alone. In 2012, British publication Rock Sound added La Dispute's debut album into their 101 Modern Classics, placed at number 53. They considered the album more of a classic than Korn's Follow The Leader and Rage Against the Machine's Battle of Los Angeles. Stating that \\"their debut album was an emotional trip through scratchy punk, dissonant hardcore and broken poetry; strength, though, lies in its uniqueness.\\" \\"The Last Lost Continent\\" appeared on a best-of emo songs list by Vulture.  10th anniversary reissue  In August 2018, the band announced that they would be releasing an updated version of Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, featuring re-amped versions of the original guitar and bass tracks (engineered by Rooms of the House co-producer Will Yip).

Spectrum is limited and much of it already in use. This raises the issue of space and strength of supporting the network. The infrastructure has to reach across the entire United States in areas that normally do not have Internet access. The main concept is to bring wireless service to residents in areas that may otherwise not have access to it.Commends Obama Wireless Proposals . Public Knowledge (2011-02-10). Retrieved on 2011-05-01. The public's interest in this plan is important as the people are the ones who will utilize this service. Network neutrality raises issues on freedom of information and who will have control over how the information is released, or even lack of control. The Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution claimed that wireless Internet access had the potential to enhance economic competition and improve the quality of life.Code of Federal Regulations on FDSys U.S. Government Printing Office Memorandum on Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution The Internet is considered an important part of the economy and advanced business opportunities as it is a vital infrastructure. The Code of Federal Regulations says that this is the beginning of the next transformation in information technology, as we encounter the wireless broadband revolution. Strategy The initial plan by President George W. Bush was to have broadband availability for all Americans by 2007.Federal Communications Commission FCC Task Force Recommends Actions to Speed the Rollout of Wireless Broadband Services In February, 2011, President Obama announced details of the \\"National Wireless Initiative\\" or \\"Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative\\". Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairperson Michael K. Powell created the Wireless Broadband Access Task Force to help bring the plan together. The members study existing wireless broadband policies, making recommendations in the FCC's policies for acceleration in the deployment of the wireless technologies and services. This is completed by seeking out the expertise, experience, and advice of consumers, state and local governments, the industry, and other stakeholders. These recommendations are intended to assist with how to make policies and further progress the process for the national wireless plan. They are based on the inquiry of the state of wireless broadband as well as the FCC's policies that impact these services. Powell commented in a statement that this broadband plan is a catalyst for positive change, bringing resources and jobs to communities across the country.Federal Communications Commission Separate Statement of Chairman Michael K. Powell The CTIA The Wireless Association encouraged legislative action that recognizes the unique and invaluable role of wireless in providing Americans Internet access.Broadband Overview. Ctia.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. This plan included issues such as: *Radio spectrum *How the radio spectrum will support national wireless broadband *Cost of creating the wireless network *Maintaining the network *Who will create the network and infrastructure *Who will support the network and infrastructure *Consideration of what the public interest is in this plan, *The wireless plan's policies, *What the current President of the United States plans to do *How the previous President George W. Bush promoted this plan. Spectrum=Freeing space The plan is to free up enough of the radio spectrum from licensed and unlicensed space. To free up space, the FCC intends to hold incentive auctions, spurring innovation, by current licensees voluntarily giving up their spectrum space.President Obama Details Plan to Win the Future through Expanded Wireless Access  The White House. Whitehouse.gov (2011-02-10). Retrieved on 2011-05-01. The CTIA has requested the FCC to obtain more capacity on the spectrum by placing priority on additional spectrum through the national wireless plan. This hopes to ensure space on the spectrum for the wireless broadband to work. The auction would also require legislation to conduct for the spectrum to be reassigned and reallocated. In this plan, legislation is needed for the FCC to hold these auctions to enable the current spectrum holders to realize a portion of the revenues if they participate. These voluntary incentive auctions for licensees are a critical part of freeing the spectrum, as well as encouraging the government to more efficiently use the spectrum. The auction is intended to bring profit back to the United States and new licensees. However, it was brought up in February 2011 that it is not clear on whether these incentive auctions will take place. One goal of the plan is to reduce the national deficit by approximately $10 billion through these license auctions and other business opportunities. The auctions and increased spectrum efficiency from the government would raise $27.8 billion over the next ten years. The government will be expected to use the spectrum more efficiently using new financial-compensation tools with commitments to using advanced technologies. There is also the idea to spur innovation by using $3 billion of the spectrum proceeds for research and development of newer wireless technologies and applications. Spectrum sections to use Wireless requires bandwidth, and because of this, there would need to be enough of the spectrum obtained to sustain the bandwidth of the network. It also needs to be considered that upload links and downstream communication can require a difference amount of space. In the FCC News in 2005, it is mentioned that there needs to be enough spectrum to account for the unbalancing of broadband services. The service typically needs a larger amount of bandwidth for downstream than for upload links. Wireless will only work with adequate spectrum to support the initiative and the many devices, networks, and applications that it will run. President Obama has set a goal of freeing 500 MHz of the spectrum for any wireless device within a decade. The CTIA also supports this within the next ten years. The space would also need to be within the stronger part of the spectrum. According to the 112th United States Congress, the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act calls for this to be within the 700 MHz D block spectrum for rural and urban areas and was originally requested to be done before the Digital TV transition.Bill Text 112th Congress S.28.IS Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act The 700 MHz D block refers to the portion of the spectrum between the following frequencies *758 MHz to 763 MHz *788 MHz to 793 MHz.H.R.607: Broadband for First Responders Act of 2011 ‚Äì U.S. Congress . OpenCongress (2011-04-26). Retrieved on 2011-05-01. In its pursuit to support the FCC, the CTIA also recommended the spectrum in the following ranges *1.7 GHz *2.1 GHz bands. With 4G deployment rising, it is critical to have the airwave space to support future innovation and to avoid the spectrum crunch. This provides clearance in the spectrum that is already allocated to wireless carriers. The CTIA also have requested access to existing utility poles where new construction is not possible. Although the spectrum is wide, the science and physics of the spectrum still create limited amounts of space.Net Neutrality Overview. Ctia.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. Reserved spectrum President Obama also plans to increase public safety by reallocating the D block of the spectrum and $500 million within the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund. The 700 MHz D block spectrum would be reallocated and integrated for public safety entities. The Communications Act of 1934 would be amended to increase the electromagnetic spectrum by 10 MHz for public safety.S.28: Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act ‚Äì U.S. Congress. OpenCongress. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. An important part of this spectrum plan is that there is already space for public safety. One piece that needs to be determined is how to integrate the 700 MHz D block that will be reallocated with the existing public safety spectrum. The current 20 MHz of public safety spectrum needs to be determined how to be licensed as well. The considerations are nationwide, regional, statewide or some combination in accordance with the public interest. Review of the spectrum use In Section 205 of the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act of the 112th United States Congress, it is required to have a review of the use of the spectrum after a certain period of time of the deployment. After no more than 5 years of the implementation of the wireless network plan, the Commission must conduct a survey and submit a report regarding the public safety spectrum. This includes how the spectrum is being used, recommendations on whether more spectrum is needed and determine if there is opportunity for some of the spectrum to be returned for other commercial purposes. The report intends to make sure that there is the right amount of spectrum and ensure it is being used for the correct purposes, as there is only a limited amount of spectrum overall. From the Administration of Barack Obama, they also would like to test the value of underutilized spectrum to be able to open new avenues of use. Since spectrum space is limited, looking at other spectrum could allow other licensees to move elsewhere, perhaps freeing up more for wireless. Utilizing other spectrum would allow development of advanced technologies. The Secretary of Commerce, National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense, Department of Justice, NASA and other organizations have been designated to create a plan to explore these innovative spectrum-sharing technologies. Technology and infrastructure In the 1950s, the town of Ten Sleep, Wyoming, had just set up their phone service using federal subsidies and stringing copper wire to every home.Greeley, Brendan. (2011-02-17) The Flaw in Obama's Wireless Plan. BusinessWeek. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. In 2005, they upgraded to fiber optic cable, giving the residents high-speed Internet access. This scenario caught President Obama's eye in terms of success, which he hopes to duplicate with the national wireless broadband. On February 10, 2011, he pointed to this example of what he wants to replicate and hopes it will help progress more economic development by providing Internet to almost all Americans. Brendan Greenley from Business Week magazine does not believe Obama's plan will create another success story. While examples are helpful to reference when creating a plan, not all plans react the same way. There are many different factors involved, such as geography and the type of users involved. How a technology is designed and built is just as important as the technology itself. Without a proper infrastructure, a national wireless broadband network would not benefit the country. George Ford from the Phoenix Center commented that a reasonable target for broadband would be 95% Internet availability to Americans in five years and questioned the need for coverage across the entire country. There has been a large permeation of Internet users over the last five years. However, there are still reasons to have wired networking. As stated by Brendan Greeley, call centers and data storage facilities placed in smaller towns need the speed and capacity that a wired fiber optic network can provide. Wireless networks pose challenges that wired networks do not. One challenge is the infrastructure of a wireless network, like the spectrum, versus a wired network. For Ten Sleep, they installed fiber optic cable to increase their network speed. Wireless does not have this capability. Fiber optic cable has more capacity than the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning even if the entire spectrum was allocated to the national wireless network, there still would not be the same capacity in fiber optic. New technologies Technology is growing at an incredible speed, with one important technology being the speed of information. The newest generation of speed at \\"4G\\" is being deployed at rapid speeds throughout the United States by the leading carriers, and promises to be greatly beneficial to the economy and society. Next-generation technology is ten times faster than current speeds and is capable of benefiting all Americans, helping public safety increase, and further progressing the innovation for wireless applications, equipment and services. The advancement of technology is intended to move us forward and catch up with other nations that have already implemented these technologies. The technological advances in wireless broadband, like mobile broadband, provide a solid foundation for improved delivery of services. Support of the wireless network A supported infrastructure is important for any network, whether technologically based or socially based. The national wireless network is no different. Under Section 105 Interoperability of the bill S.28, the Commission must establish the technical and operational rules to ensure the national wireless networks are interoperable. It has so far yet to be established as to who will actually support the network, being the government or a private Internet service provider. Rules are to be established to permit a public safety licensee to authorize a service provider to construct and operate the wireless network. It is also in the plan to have the service provider use their licensee spectrum if the authorization would expedite broadband communications. The supporting parties will also have to ensure the safety of the network by protecting and monitoring against cyber attacks and any other form of security threat. It is imperative to have a secure network that is accessible for the nation to use. A safe environment is needed for new capabilities to be secure, trustworthy and provide necessary safeguards for privacy of users and public safety. Cost President Obama estimated a one-time investment of $5 billion and a reformation of the Universal Service Fund to help millions of Americans get access to these technologies. Another estimated cost of the wireless broadband plan is $7.2 billion from stimulus funds.Rhett, Joshua. (2010-04-07) Obama's High-Speed Internet Plan: Broadband or Boondoggle?. FoxNews.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. Another plan is calling for $10.7 billion to commit to the support, development and deployment of the wireless broadband. Despite the cost, wireless would help with public safety affordance of greater levels of effectiveness and interoperability. With broadband technologies developing, equipment and services are getting faster and cheaper. Again, Obama proposes to pay for the wireless network by having broadcasters give back their privilege to the spectrum for government auction. The auction would then be mostly profit so costs would come from the infrastructure and maintenance of the network, not the spectrum space. It is still questioned whether the costs are too high and if the end benefits outweigh those costs. In a report by George Ford at Fox News Channel, he stated that spending money on the last frontier of broadband has small incremental value. Obama not only estimated a one-time investment, but also stated a public safety cost. He called for a $10.7 billion investment to ensure public safety benefits from the technology and to have $3.2 billion to reallocate the D block of the spectrum as mentioned before. This band of the spectrum would be reserved solely for public safety as stated under current law. Another $7 billion would be needed to support the deployment of the network, and then $500 million from the Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund for research and development, and to tailor the network to public safety needs. Although many billions of dollars will go towards building this plan, reducing the national deficit by billions of dollars can be considered worthwhile. Again, President Obama does hope that this plan will cut the nation deficit by $9.6 billion over the next ten years. The thought of whether the cost is too high also raises other points in the media. John Horrigan of the Pew Research Center commented that the high cost of broadband now is why more Americans are not already using it. There is also the consideration that not every American has access to a computer. Although smartphones with Internet capabilities have been on the rise for many years now, there is still a reason the entire nation is not \\"online\\". Whether it is the cost of an Internet-ready device or computer, or obtaining Internet service, cost is still a big factor for this technology. In terms of cost, one-third of Americans who do not have broadband access say cost prohibits them from purchasing it. Impact on the people Public interest is important for policies promoting wireless broadband for Americans. The interest of the public is important because if the public does not condone the cost and the utility, the nation will have to cover the failure of the deployment. However, the public may also consider this to be an excellent development for our country. Part of the national wireless broadband goal is to enable businesses to grow faster, help students learn more, and assist public safety officers with having the best, state-of-the-art technology and communications available. During his State of the Union address, President Obama announced a National Wireless Initiative to make available high speed wireless Internet services for 98% of Americans. This plan was primarily designed to get this technology to reach more rural areas that otherwise did not have the opportunity of obtaining the service.NCTA Comments 06/15/07. NCTA.com (2007-06-15). Retrieved on 2011-05-01. On February 10, 2011 President Obama was commended for his proposal on pursuing the plan with the idea that this would greatly increase jobs and innovation. The concept of the \\"last mile\\" is often brought up for Internet Service Providers (ISP) as they try to expand their network, often time having to stop before the last house on the block because of cost. However, even though this issue happens throughout rural areas, 57% of Americans use broadband services with 91% already having access according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Those that have Internet can access an incredible amount of information at any time as long as they have an Internet-ready device. There has also been an increase in the applications that utilize Internet services. The proliferation of wireless applications is on the rise and continues to empower users and communities. Home Internet usage A national wireless broadband network is not only about providing Internet access for personal computers in the home, but for anyone with a wireless Internet-ready device. In 2006, the number of households passed over for high-speed Internet was 119 million, and over the past two years, the cable industry has invested $23 billion into their networks. As the number of homes serviced declines, broadband technology is able to develop. Commissioner Robert M. McDowell commented that the broadband technology has been the fastest in penetration of any technology in modern history. With the broadband technology, the number of devices that are Internet-ready has been increasing year after year. Both cell phone and laptops with wireless capabilities have increased Internet usage dramatically and have each grown more prevalent since 2009.Smith, Aaron. (2010-07-07) Mobile Access 2010  Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Pewinternet.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-01. It is no longer working professionals with high Internet use, but young adults as well. About 47% of adults go online with a laptop, up from 39% as of April 2009. Also, 40% of adults use a mobile phone, up from 32% in 2009. The world has seen great technologies, and the Internet is one of the fastest growing because of the number of devices designed to utilize it. According to Pew Research, 59% of adults access the Internet wirelessly through some type of wireless device. Again, this is an increase from the 51% in April 2009. Internet access has become a critical part of our lives. The deployment and development of wireless broadband as well as other technologies is critical to ensuring this reliable and ubiquitous service is available to Americans. Impact on health matters and other public uses Some have not only considered personal or business related uses of national wireless, but the health related uses for hospitals and their patients. As Blair Levin from the Technology, Innovation and Government Reform Team of President Obama states, this will create a world-class broadband platform allowing modernizing of health care records and reforming education. Being able to have the instant availability to health records for doctors and patients, and being able to teach and be taught from anywhere in the United States is a concept some may never have considered, or thought possible. As John Horrigan from the Pew Research Center stated, people not understanding the technology being of relevancy to them is a bigger barrier than the cost of the technology itself. Michael Powell stated Americans benefit most when policies enable consumers and businesses to fully utilize the benefits of emerging technology. Public safety Public safety has been mentioned in terms of the spectrum use and cost. Public safety is also important in regards to public interest. With the implementation of national wireless broadband, this initiative helps improve public safety communications. The Commission for 9/11 has noted that our homeland security is vulnerable due to lack of interoperable wireless communication among first responders. The plan would allow all public safety officials to be on the same network, and get the correct information quicker and safer. With 4G networking, they can be provided with a unique opportunity to deploy a system in conjunction with the commercial infrastructure already available. Network neutrality Network neutrality is becoming a big issue with the policies involved in the national wireless plan. If the plan comes together, the question of restricting access to the Internet is reason for concern. Network neutrality is the concept of having no rules and regulations for what consumers are able to access through the Internet by their ISPs. As stated by the CTIA, our economic conditions make it hard to understand why people want to impose network neutrality rules, and inject uncertainty in an industry that seems to be working well for the U.S. This is for both wired and wireless broadband networks. These types of infrastructures cannot be managed for customers and expectations with a one-size-fits-all approach. The debate is due to the types of restrictions ISPs should be allowed to have if consumers are paying for the service they want. As with wired Internet access, the CTIA has stated that they strongly believe that regulation is not necessary and may do more harm than good. More users are obtaining access to the internet and have the wireless devices to access it. It is no surprise that wireless is the fastest growing broadband service. There is also an increase in the number of users that rely solely on wireless instead of wired connections. Wireless service providers are constantly competing to create the best network with the best service and quality. With more towers and increased advanced technologies, wireless has become a convenient and widely accessible mode of communication. The negative, however, is the technology which wireless Internet uses. As previously stated, the spectrum itself is limited and wireless data networks rely on the finite source. Since the FCC has developed the plan to open the spectrum for the wireless network, the issue of network neutrality is cause for concern for some. The CTIA stated that the imposition of network neutrality will inject uncertainty in the market. Since this concept supports users having access to the information they want through the Internet, it raises the problem of consumers having limited options. This could ultimately harm consumers and hamper innovation.

It shipped with Linux 2.6, GNOME 2.6, KDE 3.2, and Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) (SELinux was disabled by default due to concerns that it radically altered the way that Fedora Core ran). XFree86 was replaced by the newer X.org, a merger of the previous official X11R6 release, which additionally included a number of updates to Xrender, Xft, Xcursor, fontconfig libraries, and other significant improvements.  Fedora Core 1  Fedora Core 1 with Gnome Fedora Core 1 was the first version of Fedora and was released on November 6, 2003. It was codenamed Yarrow.

It is just north of the community of Nestor Falls, and right across Ontario Highway 71 from Stevens Bay on Lake of the Woods. It also feeds Lake of the Woods through a series of lakes starting with Cedartree Lake. Geography It is a body of water that is essentially not charted, and caution must be taken when navigating this body of water. Kakagi Lake is approximately in size, about long and up to wide. It is above sea level with an average depth and a maximum depth of . The lake has many islands such as Gold Point Island, Green Island, Mink Island, Bear-Beaver Island, Alora Island, Mosquito Point Island and Pine Island. There are several spots on the lake frequented by campers as well as several natural recreational areas such as Jumping Rock, Seagull Rock and Soft Sand Beach. There are small number of private cabins mostly on Young's Bay, and several commercial fishing lodges and resorts. In winter, Kakagi is the gateway to a system of lakes and portages that stretches almost east of Nestor Falls by snowmobile. Young's Bay is named after Clyde Young who came to Canada from Chicago in 1932 and was founder of Crow Lake Camp. The Ojibways of Onigaming First Nation lay claim to much of Kakagi Lake; their Sabaskong Bay 35D reserve is on the southwest shore of the lake. The lake also has a history of gold mining. Natural history Kakagi lake is well known for its lake trout fishing because of its many spawning reefs throughout the lake and deep water basins equally well distributed. Musky, smallmouth bass, northern pike and lake whitefish also inhabit Kakagi. Kagaki's forage fish include perch, rock bass, cisco, lake shiners and a variety of other minnow species. Recreation=Canoe Route There is a popular canoe route known as the Kakagi Lake-Cameron Lake canoe route. The loop is considered of moderate difficulty and starts and ends at Kakagi.

The portage is long and is located on the east side of Cameron Creek. Move east down Stephen Lake via the narrows. The pictographs are found just after the narrows and to the left just around the bay. Move to the east on Stephen Lake into the bay until the portage to Cameron Lake via Cameron Creek. The portage is long () and follows a small creek to the south of the trail. Next move into Bog Bay through the narrows and into Cameron Lake and then follow the south shore for to the most southeasterly end of the lake to the portage back into Kakagi Lake. The portage is long (). Once on Kakagi Lake, follow the north shore, heading west for about the continue west back to the Government dock for .

The series followed an almost identical format to the earlier Lift Off with Ayshea, also created by series producer Muriel Young. The series was presented by former 'straight man' to Basil Brush, Roy North, initially with Linda Fletcher and then later with Megg Nicol who had made her debut presenting with Mike Read in Yorkshire TV's Pop Quest. Whereas Lift Off had been originally designed to showcase viewer's pop music requests by guest artists, Get It Together relied more on the presenters and resident band and singers. Mike Moran was the show's musical director, leading the studio band on camera, with singers including Victy Silva and Kim Goody. According to the BFI database, the first show was televised on 6 April 1977 and the last on 22 December 1981. It is possible that the first transmission was in fact earlier. One of the first guests on the series were that year's British representatives in the Eurovision Song Contest Lynsey de Paul & Mike Moran, but that episode is not listed in the BFI credits. According to BFI, Series 1 ran from 6 April - 6 July 1977, consisting of 12 episodes. The show then returned later that year for a Christmas special on 27 December, entitled Get It Together with The Bay City Rollers. Series 2 ran from 10 January - 21 March 1978, featuring 11 shows. Series 3 ran from 19 September - 19 December 1978, followed by a Christmas Special on 26 December, for a total of 15 shows. Series 4 ran from 10 April - 15 May 1979, for just 6 episodes. Series 5 ran from 27 November 1979 ‚Äì 6 March 1980, including the Get It Together Christmas Bonanza on 26 December 1979, for a run of 13 shows. Series 6 ran from 23 September - 23 December 1980, featuring 14 shows. The final series 7, ran from 1 September - 22 December 1981, featuring 14 shows, with Megg Nicol replacing Linda Fletcher as co-presenter to North.

With regard to women's rights, the priority in Austria is based on the equal treatment of both genders, rather than having equal rights only. Thus, Austrian women benefit from their government's attempt to compensate for gender-specific inequality of burdens. However, the concept of traditional roles, influenced by Roman Catholicism in Austria, is still prevalent within Austrian society. Suffrage First attempts to improve political participation by women were made during the Revolution of 1848 by the Wiener Demokratischer Frauenverein, but the association was short-lived. The struggle for suffrage began anew with the formation of Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein in 1893. Women's suffrage was granted in 1919, after the breakdown of the Habsburg Monarchy. Marriage and family life As in other European countries, marriage was traditionally based on the husband's legal authority over the wife. Until the late 1970s, married women's freedoms were legally restricted.Contemporary Western European Feminism, by Gisela Kaplan, p. 133 Austria made marital rape illegal in 1989. Austria was one of the last Western countries to decriminalize adultery, in 1997.http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/debatte-ueber-untreue-gesetz- noch-1997-drohte-oesterreichs-ehebrechern-gefaengnis-a-317486.html In 2004 marital rape became a state offense meaning it can be prosecuted by the state even in the absence of a complaint from the spouse, with procedures being similar to stranger rape. In recent years, new ways of living have emerged, with unmarried cohabitation increasing, as more young people question traditional ways. In the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008 the percentage of Austrian respondents who agreed with the assertion that \\"Marriage is an outdated institution\\" was 30.5%, See: Variable Description - Family - Q 45. and as of 2012, 41.5% of children were born outside of marriage.http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin;=1&language;=en&pcode;=tps00018 The total fertility rate is 1.46 children/women (as of 2015),https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. Employment Most women are employed, but many work part-time. In the European Union, only the Netherlands has more women working part- time.http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=ro&catId;=89&newsId;=2535&furtherNews;=yes As in other German speaking areas of Europe, social norms regarding gender roles are quite conservative. In 2011, Jose Manuel Barroso, then president of the European Commission, stated \\"Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce\\".http://www.dw.com/en/germanys- persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0  Infrastructure changes  In the early 1990s, most of the pedestrian traffic and public transportation in Vienna was accounted for by women. Eva Kail organized ‚ÄúWho Owns Public Space ‚Äì Women‚Äôs Everyday Life in the City‚Äù in 1991. This exhibit, coupled with a 1999 survey conducted by the City Women‚Äôs Office, demonstrated that women, in general, had more varied destinations and needed safety measures in travel more than the men in the city. These led to a change in Vienna‚Äôs urban planning. Some of the changes implemented by the city include widening the sidewalks and adding pedestrian overpasses in certain areas. Vienna started the Frauen-Werk-Stadt, a project to produce housing complexes designed by female architects specifically to account for the needs of women. These complexes have easy access to public transportation, as well as on site facilities, such as kindergartens and pharmacies. Similar efforts with a heavy emphasis on aiding women were conducted following Vienna‚Äôs success. The changes in infrastructure served to significantly increase pedestrian traffic. As a result, the streets were more densely packed with witnesses of potential crimes. This served to reduce the amount of minor crimes committed in public spaces. Linda McDowell argued that such efforts are counterproductive, and act to deepen the existing class struggles in locations such as Vienna. McDowell‚Äôs main contention is these efforts were not careful enough to account for both women‚Äôs rights, as well as poverty.

Early life and education Yafeu Fula was born on October 9, 1977, in the Bronx to Sekou Odinga and Yaasmyn Fula. When Fula was four years old, his father, Odinga, was arrested and charged with six counts of attempted murder, nine predicate acts of racketeering influenced corrupt organization (RICO), assisting in the escape of Assata Shakur from prison and violent theft of an armored truck. Yafeu and his seven siblings were raised by their mother, whose surname he adopted. Kadafi's parents were both members of the Black Panther Party. Yaasmyn Fula and Tupac Shakur's mother, Afeni Shakur, were close friends, and Kadafi and Tupac were friends until their respective deaths in 1996. Career In 1994, Fula ran into his childhood friend Mutah \\"Napoleon\\" Beale. Yafeu's mother introduced Napoleon to Tupac Shakur, and all three created Dramacydal. Yafeu, only 16, took on the stage name of Young Hollywood. The group appeared on Tupac's album Me Against The World. When Tupac was in prison in 1995 on sexual assault charges, Kadafi visited him daily. At one of these visits, Tupac and Kadafi decided to form the rap group Outlawz, which would bring many members back from Tupac's earlier groups, Dramacydal and Thug Life. Fula also teamed up with fellow Outlawz member Hussein Fatal to record material under the name \\"Fatal-N- Felony.\\" An album was planned but never materialized, although some songs planned for the album appeared on Son Rize Vol.1. That same year, upon Tupac's release from prison, Kadafi met with him to sign with Death Row. He guest- starred on Tupac's All Eyez On Me and featured on three songs. At this point, Fula began his entry into the public eye, appearing in music videos, going to award shows and performing onstage. The Outlawz recorded frequently with Tupac throughout 1996. On September 13, 1996, Tupac died after being shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip on September 7. Kadafi was in the car directly behind Tupac, and claimed to have seen the white Cadillac pull up alongside him and open fire. Kadafi reportedly said he could identify the driver and had requested to keep it 100% confidential but was exposed by news reporters. Death On November 10, 1996, nearly two months after Tupac's death, Kadafi, at the age of 19, was found slumped in the third- floor stairwell of an apartment building at 325 Mechanic Street in Orange, New Jersey. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Fula was found by New Jersey police at 3:48 am. It is believed he had been accidentally shot once in the head by Napoleon's cousin, Roddy Beale, who later turned himself in to the police and served 7‚Äì8 years in prison. However, this has been disputed by Kadafi's mother and a female witness His death has been written about in numerous publications, including the book The Killing of Tupac Shakur by Cathy Scott.

The patterns and rights of property ownership vary between societies and are influenced by cultural, racial, political, and legal factors. The lack of control over both productive and non-productive resources that is apparent in both rural and urban settings places women at a reduced level of advantage in areas of security of home, maintaining a basis for survival, and accessing economic opportunities. Development-related problems faced across the globe have been increasingly linked to women's lack of property and inheritance rights, especially in regard to land and property ownership, encompassing areas such as low levels of education, hunger, and poor health. Thus land property rights, through their impact on patterns of production, distribution of wealth, as well as market development, has evolved as one of the prerequisites of economic growth and poverty reduction. Defining land rights Property rights are claims to property that are legally and socially recognized and enforceable by external legitimized authority. Broadly defined, land rights can be understood as a variety of legitimate claims to land and the benefits and products produced on that land. Inheritance, transfers from the State, tenancy arrangements, and land purchase are all constructs of land rights. These rights can be in the form of actual ownership or usufruct, the rights of use. Global overview Women play an integral part in the production of food and goods, from work in fields, factories, and home-based business across the globe. There is a critical relationship in the role that women play and the sustenance provided for families, communities, and nations. Globally, an estimated 41% of women headed households live below the locally defined poverty line, with one-third of the world's women either homeless or living in inadequate housing facilities. The additional exclusion of women from access to land pushes them towards cities, where they often join the ranks of increasing number of women- headed households in slum areas. However, through the processes of globalization and industrialization, there has been a noted increase in the numbers of women entering in the waged labor sectors. Rural women are solely responsible for half of the world's food production, and in developing countries, as much as 80% of food crops. More recent estimates claim that half of the world's food and in developing countries, between 60-80% of food crops are the results of growth from seeds that have been planted by a woman's hand. This persistence of traditional divisions of labor, in which women hold primary responsibility for producing food, as well as other labor-intensive tasks such as gather water and fuel, contributes to the large percentage of women informally working in rural areas. The roles that women play differ significantly by region, with an average of 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, ranging from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, in addition to increasing vulnerability and reducing status, exclusion of women from the decision making process and the control and transfer of land has also led to a decrease in food security and sustainable development. Shifting systems Though women's lack of formal control over land and resources has long persisting historical roots, economies and societies undergoing extensive change have created deep implications for ownership rights. In subsistence production systems, access to land was determined by status within the family rather than actual ownership rights; resulting in both men and women having ‚Äúuser rights‚Äù to produce food for their families. The combined processes of industrialization and globalization have disrupted longstanding livelihoods and systems of production, forcing many families to focus more on income-generating activities than on subsistence practices. However, increasing women's access to property rights has numerous significant economic benefits for the overall community as well as psychological and social benefits for the lives of women, themselves, especially in agricultural societies. Economically, when women have greater access to land-ownership in rural areas, which started being implemented by the government following the 20th century mandates on property laws in order to ultimately promote greater gender equality, women begin to independently cultivate their own land (given to them either by the state itself, allocated otherwise through the private market, or passed on by a male relative), form women collectives to learn more about agricultural practices as well as profit-generating skills and ultimately, have yielded more output from that given land than the previous owners. Further, the psychological benefits from increasing women's access to property rights is that this leads to a significant decrease in instances of marital domestic violence. All of these factors would contribute positively to the economic growth of that given community in the long-term by experiencing greater overall labor force participation rates, increased income generation and greater investment in child healthcare and education, also thereby combating malnutrition and breaking out of the poverty cycle. Impact of gender bias The typical process of agrarian transformation under which labor shifts from agriculture to nonagricultural has occurred slowly and with heavy gender-bias. Because women's property rights are often assumed through the security of the oftentimes, male, household head, some inheritance laws allocate less property to female heirs than male heirs. Ongoing adherence to male-dominated traditions of property ownership has generally meant that women cannot take advantage of the wide range of benefits associated with ownership and control of property. According to the Land Tenure Service at FAO, poverty is inversely correlated with household land ownership and direct access to land minimizes women's risk of impoverishment and improvements the physical well-being and prospects for children. Land titles The process of titling has been administered with strong gender bias, with women usually denied equal ownership rights. Furthermore, property and inheritance claims are generally processed through loosely organized administrative bodies consisting of local leaders and clerks with limited legal training. Closer inspection of the decision makers, notes a body of mostly males. Patriarchal property rights Women who are potentially able to meet their subsistence needs on their own may threaten to leave the household if they are not given a large share of the surplus. However, due to patriarchal property rights, husbands control over the allocation of wives‚Äô labor time, husbands can make decisions that reduce the value of their wives‚Äô alternatives to marriage. Both the right to manage land and control the income from production, encompassing secure rights to land access, have much deeper implications than mere access. For many women, access to land and property are essential to the production of food as well as sustainable livelihoods, but are dependent on natal and marital affiliations. In many countries, women can lose rights to land when there is a change in marital status, including marriage, divorce, or even death of a spouse. Male dominance Because of the worldwide prevalence of patrilineal inheritance customs, both productive resources and property such as household goods have ended up in the hands of men and not women. When only men have rights of inheritance or family succession, women have little opportunity to improve their status or living conditions within the family and community. Consequently, they are rendered dependent on male relatives for survival and have little say over how property is used to generate income or to support families. Additionally, within patrilineal communities, there is a strong resistance by men towards endowing women, especially daughters, with rights to land access. Barriers to change status=Inadequate laws and systems of enforcement While there are a growing number of contemporary laws, as framed by the modern State, which give inheritance rights to daughters when they are recognized as individuals among the communities, the process of marriage and the traditionally patrilineal customs have remained largely unchanged. Thus, there remains a mismatch between marriage practices and inheritance laws, with the strength and biases of the marriage practice often overriding inheritance laws. This is also evidenced in the process of dowry practices. In many cultures, a daughter's dowry is viewed by her family as her direct portion of her inheritance, even though it may be typically absorbed by the new husband and his family. Thus, while in some communities women do have the formal rights to inherit lands, the social representation of inheritance in the form of dowries and the strength of the practice of marriage trump given laws. Lack of awareness existing laws and insufficient understanding of legal redress options Levels of education, oftentimes products of restrictions on women's interaction with institutions which are primarily composed of men, create a mystique and illusion about legal actions. Additionally, ideologies about the conduct that a woman displays, normally taking the form of docility, can bring shame to the idea of challenging persisting gender inequalities in law, policy and land rights. Prevalence of traditional attitudes and practices Gender ideologies, or beliefs and stereotypes of the expected characteristics of a particular gender, provide a barrier for women to gain property rights and enhance status. These ideologies may take the form of assumptions of the role that a woman plays in society, her needs or capabilities, which thus affect the way that an issue is framed and implemented.

The success of Israel's high-tech sector over the past two decades has attracted recent attention from business journalists and The Economist describes Start-up Nation as the most notable of a \\"growing pile\\" of books on the subject. In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard \\"the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success\\" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are mandatory military service and immigration. The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the Israel Defense Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued. IDF soldiers \\"have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so.\\" Neither ranks nor ages matter much \\"when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year- olds can train their uncles,\\" and \\"Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders.\\" The book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: \\"Immigrants are not averse to start from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose.\\" Additional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, a culture where individuals frequently tinker with technology, and government policies friendly to start-ups. Using stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them \\"the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts.\\" While the book describes Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, in the words of one reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own Nokia, Samsung, or IBM. According to the book's authors, this is partly because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies. Senor and Singer interviewed over 100 people to write the book, among them leading Israeli venture investors including key players in Google, Intel, and Cisco; and historians, U.S. military leaders, and Israeli heads of state.Senor and Singer, pp. 240-241. Their conclusion is that \\"while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel.\\"Senor and Singer, p. 236. Authors Dan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the United States government. He served as chief spokesmen for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former editorial page editor for The Jerusalem Post. Critical reception=Praise Jon Rosen OF USA Today believes that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and may irk those with reservations about Israeli foreign policy, but it is still an accomplishment, \\"not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world.\\" In The Wall Street Journal, James K. Glassman says that \\"the greatest strength of Start-up Nation is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'\\" Publishers Weekly states that \\"the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture.\\" In The Economic Times, R Gopalakrishnan writes that the use of Hebrew expressions makes the book \\"alive and eminently-readable.\\" Besides chutzpah, the authors use the word bitzua, which roughly means \\"getting things done.\\" Another Hebrew expression used in the book is rosh gadol, literally \\"big head\\", which could be translated \\"can-do and responsible attitude with scant respect for the limitations of formal authority.\\" Gopalakrishnan concludes that the ideas demonstrated in the book \\"are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture.\\" David Horovitz of The Jerusalem Post says that conclusions of Start-up Nation find confirmation in the real world, such as how the life of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was saved when an emergency medical team applied a revolutionary elasticized bandage developed in Israel to staunch her head wounds. A review in The Washington Post says that \\"the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs\\" such as the story of Shvat Shaked, who \\"founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software.\\" The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing \\"straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies\\". Maureen Farrell of Forbes was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of U.S. foreign aid, but says the book \\"is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation.\\" Criticism Ruth Schuster, reviewing the book for Haaretz, feels that it is \\"tarnished by a jarring, tub- thumping patriotism.\\" A review in The Christian Science Monitor notes that \\"critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq- listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be.\\" Yusuf Mansur, writing in the Jordan Times, argues that two of the factors to which Senor and Singer attribute Israel's success, the IDF and Soviet- Jewish immigration, have only been sustainable because of the foreign aid that Israel receives from the United States and private sources. Mansur also faults the authors for suggesting that the disparity between entrepreneurship in Israel's Arab and Jewish sectors is rooted in the exemption of Arabs from military service rather than what Mansour perceives to be \\"the discriminatory policies of Israel against its Arab citizens,\\" particularly in education and the labor market.\\"Financing 'the start-up nation'\\", Jordan Times, April 6, 2010. Gal Beckerman, writing in The Forward magazine, observes that the book \\"presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians, or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements.\\"Beckerman, Gal: \\"Senor Decides Against Running for Senate, Citing Family and Business\\", The Forward, March 24, 2010. Impact Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended Start-up Nation as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship.

The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle CNN's Fareed Zakaria called Start-up Nation \\"a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read.\\" The book is cited as a handbook of \\"classic economics.\\" It teaches small businesses \\"how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team places an emphasis on chutzpah first.\\" Start-Up Nation: Business Lessons from Israel Former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad reportedly kept a copy of Start-up Nation on his desk as a source of inspiration for the West Bank's own burgeoning technology industry.

The Jesuits were advocates of a negotiated settlement between the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN), the guerilla organization that had fought the government for a decade. The murders attracted international attention to the Jesuits' efforts and increased international pressure for a cease-fire, representing one of the key turning points that led toward a negotiated settlement to the war. Events Note: All descriptions of events are taken from the Truth Commission's report and the summary of accusations admitted by the Spanish court against the members of the Salvadoran military who were sentenced for the crime. The Salvadoran army considered the Pastoral Centre of UCA El Salvador ( Central American University) to be a \\"refuge of subversives\\". Colonel Juan Orlando Zepeda, Vice-Minister for Defence, had publicly accused UCA El Salvador of being the center of operations for FMLN terrorists. Colonel Inocente Montano, Vice- Minister for Public Security, said that the Jesuits were \\"fully identified with subversive movements.\\" In negotiations for a peaceful solution to the conflict, Jesuit priest Ignacio Ellacur√≠a had played a pivotal role. Many of the armed forces identified the Jesuit priests with the rebels, because of their special concern for those Salvadorians who were poorest and thus most affected by the war. Members of the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite unit of the Salvadoran Army implicated in some of the most infamous incidents of the Salvadoran Civil War, were a rapid-response, counter-insurgency battalion created in 1980 at the U.S. Army's School of the Americas, which was then located in Panama. On the evening of 15 November, Atlacatl Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno met with officers under his command at the Military College. He informed them that the General Staff considered the recent rebel offensive \\"critical\\", to be met with full force, and that all \\"known subversive elements\\" were to be eliminated. He had been ordered to eliminate Ellacur√≠a, leaving no witnesses. The officers decided to disguise the operation as a rebel attack, using an AK-47 rifle that had been captured from the FMLN. The soldiers first tried to force their way into the Jesuits' residence, until the priests opened the doors to them. After ordering the priests to lie face-down in the back garden, the soldiers searched the residence. Lieutenant Guerra then gave the order to kill the priests. Fathers Ellacur√≠a, Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥, and Segundo Montes were shot and killed by Private Grimaldi. Fathers Amando L√≥pez and Moreno were killed by Deputy Sergeant Antonio Ramiro Avalos Vargas. The soldiers later discovered Father Joaqu√≠n L√≥pez y L√≥pez in the residence and killed him as well. Deputy Sergeant Tom√°s Zarpate Castillo shot housekeeper Julia Elba Ramos and her 16-year-old daughter, Celina Mariceth Ramos; both women were shot again by Private Jos√© Alberto Sierra Ascencio, confirming their deaths. The soldiers removed a small suitcase containing photographs, documents, and $5,000. They then directed machine gun fire at the fa√ßade of the residence, as well as rockets and grenades. They left a cardboard sign that read \\"FMLN executed those who informed on it. Victory or death, FMLN\\".

He said he had grown accustomed to living with death threats and commented: \\"We wanted to support dialogue and peace. We were against the war. But we have been considered Communists, Marxists, supporters of the rebels, all that type of thing.\\" When The New York Times described the murdered priests as \\"leftist intellectuals\\" in March 1991, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco objected to the use of that characterization \\"without qualification or nuance\\". He offered the paper the words of Archbishop Helder Camara: \\"When I feed the hungry, they call me a saint. When I ask why they have no food, they call me a Communist.\\" Reaction The murders attracted international attention and increased international pressure for a cease-fire. It is recognized as a turning point that led toward a negotiated settlement to the war. The U.S. government, which had long provided military aid to the government, called on President Cristiani to initiate \\"the fullest inquiry and certainly a rapid one\\". It condemned the murders \\"in the strongest possible terms\\". Senator Claiborne Pell, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: \\"I am devastated by these cold-blooded murders, which appear intended to silence human rights activity in El Salvador. I appeal most urgently for an end to the fighting and for a cease-fire ... and ask that those responsible for these murders be brought to justice as swiftly as possible.\\" An editorial in The New York Times catalogued a series of similar crimes that had gone unpunished and warned that \\"What's different this time is America's horrified impatience\\". It warned that the U.S. Senate would end U.S. aid if the government of El Salvador \\"cannot halt and will not punish death squads\\".  Legal proceedings in El Salvador  Nine members of the Salvadoran military were put on trial. Only Colonel Guillermo Benavides and Lieutenant Yusshy Ren√© Mendoza were convicted. The others were either absolved or found guilty on lesser charges. Benavides and Mendoza were sentenced to thirty years in prison. Both were released from prison on 1 April 1993 following passage of the Salvadoran Amnesty Law by a legislature dominated by anti-guerilla and pro-military politicians. It was enacted to promote social and political reconciliation in the aftermath of the civil war, but its support came from the political factions most closely allied with the right-wing armed groups identified by the report as responsible for most wartime violations of human rights. The trial's outcome was confirmed by the report presented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of El Salvador, which detailed how Salvadoran military and political figures concealed vital information in order to shield those responsible for the massacre. The report identified Rodolfo Parker, a lawyer and politician who later led the Christian Democratic Party and became a member of the Legislative Assembly. It said he \\"altered statements in order to conceal the responsibility of senior officers for the murder.\\" The Jesuits in El Salvador, led by Jos√© Mar√≠a Tojeira, UCA's former rector, continued to work with the UCA's Institute of Human Rights, founded by Segundo Montes, to use the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, to bypass the Salvadoran Amnesty Law of 1993 and expose the role of higher military officers in the murders. In July 2016, the Supreme Court of El Salvador found the Amnesty Law unconstitutional, citing international human rights law. Benavides returned to prison a few weeks later to serve his sentence. In May 2017, the Jesuit community in El Salvador asked the Ministry of Justice and Public Security to commute the sentence of Benavides, who had served four years of his thirty- year sentence. They said that he had admitted and regretted his actions and that he posed no danger. Jose Maria Tojeira, head of UCA's Human Rights Institute, called him a \\"scapegoat\\" for those who ordered the murders and who remained unpunished. Legal proceedings in Spain In 2008, two human rights organizations, the Center for Justice and Accountability and the Spanish Association for Human Rights, filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court, against the former Salvadoran president Alfredo Cristiani and 14 members of the Salvadoran military, alleging their direct responsibility for the 1989 massacre. Judge Eloy Velasco admitted this lawsuit in 2009, on the basis of the principle of universal justice. Neither the Jesuits not the UCA were parties to this lawsuit. During the course of this judicial process, an unidentified witness confessed to his own participation in the massacre and implicated the High Command of the Salvadoran Military and Cristiani. Judge Velasco's resolution on the demand initially included investigations on the 14 implicated members of the Salvadoran Military, excluding the former Salvadoran president, but including the Military High Command represented by General (Colonel, at that time) Ren√© Emilio Ponce (who then was chief of defence of El Salvador). However, this new testimony opened up the investigation into former president Cristiani as well. Evidence made available for journalists included handwritten notes taken during a meeting of the Salvadoran Military High Command at which the massacre was allegedly planned, and both the military's High Command and the country's Executive were probably aware of, if not directly involved in, these planning meetings. Declassified CIA documents later indicated that for many years the CIA knew of the Salvadoran government's plans to murder the Jesuits. On 30 May 2011, the court ruled against twenty members of the Salvadoran military finding them guilty of murder, terrorism, and crimes against humanity. It ordered their immediate arrest. President Cristiaini was not included in the ruling. According to the substantiation of the ruling, the accused took advantage of an initial war context to perpetrate violations of human rights, with the aggravating character of xenophobia. Five of the murdered scholars were Spanish citizens. The propaganda against them, that prepared the context for the murder, called them leftist neoimperialists from Spain, who were in El Salvador to reinstate colonialism. Those found guilty face sentences that total 2700 years in prison. The ruling of the Spanish court specifies that the Jesuits were murdered for their efforts to end the Salvadoran civil war peacefully. The planning of the murder started when peace negotiations between the Salvadoran government and the FMLN had broken down in 1988. The leadership of the Salvadoran military were convinced that they could win the war against the FMLN militarily. They interpreted Ignacio Ellacur√≠a's efforts for peace negotiations as an inconvenience that had to be eliminated. The operation against the Jesuits involved cooperation between several military institutions. It consisted of a psychological campaign to delegitimize the Jesuits in the media, accusing them of conspiracy and cooperation with FMLN; military raids against the university, and the Jesuits' home, in order to map and plan the operation; and finally the massacre, perpetrated by the Atlacatl battalion. On August 2011, it was discovered by a human rights organization, The Center for Justice and Accountability that one of the twenty Salvadoran military officers indicted in a Spanish court, \\"Inocente Orlando Montano Morales\\", a former government vice minister of public safety, was living in Massachusetts for a decade using his real name. He was subsequently charged with immigration fraud and perjury, resulting in a plea deal with U.S. authorities, before being extradited to Spain in November 2017 to stand trial for his participation of the assassination of Father Ignacio Ellacur√≠a. On May 9, 2019, the Office of the Prosecutor of the National Court in Madrid recommended a prison term of 150 years to be served upon Inocente Montano. The trial of Montano Morales began on June 8, 2020. In September 2020, Morales was convicted of the priests' murders and sentenced to 133 years in prison. Recognition On the 20th anniversary of the massacre, President Mauricio Funes awarded the Order of Jos√© Mat√≠as Delgado, Grand Cross with Gold Star, El Salvador's highest civilian award, to the six murdered priests. Funes knew them personally, considered some of them friends, and credited their role in his professional and personal development. Several academic chairs and research centers are named for them: * the \\"Ignacio Ellacur√≠a\\" chair at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico * a similar chair at Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, Spain. * the Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥ Fund for Mental Health and Human Rights at Boston College * the Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥ prizes at the University of Chicago * the Segundo Montes community in Moraz√°n, settled by repatriated refugees, the subject of Segundo Montes' research and activism Most of these scholars are also credited for lasting contributions to the fields of philosophy, theology and liberation theology (Ellacur√≠a), psychology (Martin-Bar√≥), and social anthropology/migration studies (Montes). Some of their scholarship has been published by UCA Editores and others, but much of their material still remains uncategorized or unpublished.

It is now usually anglicised as Cassidy. The surname √ì Caiside was found in all regions of medieval Ireland, it been the name of several unrelated families. The most well-known √ì Caiside family were natives of what is now County Fermanagh, where they were poets, churchmen, scholars and hereditary physicians to the Maguire Kings of Fer Manach. Main residences of the family were Ballycassidy, north of Enniskillen; Cassidy, in the parish of Derryvullan; and Farrancassidy, on Inishmacsaint. The latter island is on Lough Erne, as is Daimhinis, which was associated with the family. As with other Brehon clans, family members found employment beyond their home regions, usually elsewhere in Ulster.

Personal life In 1864 Walter Richmond Butler was born on his family‚Äôs farm in Pensford in Somerset, England. He was the sixth of eight children. At 15 Butler became the apprentice of developing Arts and Crafts architect Alexander Lauder (1836‚Äì1921), who allegedly described Butler as \\"a truly gifted person\\". Butler frequently travelled throughout England and Europe and it was not until 1888 that Butler decided to follow in the footsteps of five of his siblings and emigrate to Australia in search of prosperity and exciting new possibilities. He departed from Plymouth on the SS Oroya on 21 July arriving in Sydney in October, and by the end of the year had moved to Melbourne. Butler married Emelie Millicent Howard in April 1894, and they had three children: Adna Millicent Howard, Howard Richmond Henry and Winifred Howard. The family lived in Armadale in the eastern suburbs of Melbournein a large house called Duncraig. Butler‚Äôs daughter Adna once described him as \\"a very energetic man‚Ä¶ never idle. He was good at all ball games‚Ä¶ and was as fond of dancing and playing bridge as he was of mending anything\\". At the age of 21, Butler‚Äôs son Howard died fighting in WWI, and it was after this that Butler appeared to limit his professional involvement in architecture. He did however continue as a practicing architect until he retired in 1939 at the age of 75. He died in 1949 at the age of 84. Professional life Having trained with Alexander Lauder in Barnstaple UK, Butler worked for three years in the office of J D Sedding in London where he was accepted into the domestic revival groups centered on William Lethaby, Ernest Gimson and a number of other architects around Richard Norman Shaw and William Morris. In 1885 W. R. Lethaby encouraged Butler to move to London and work with J. D. Sedding, there, he worked for 3 years. In June 1888 Butler left Sedding's firm and set for Australia, where he resided and worked in Melbourne. Three of Butler's brothers and one of his sisters also settled in Australia. From 1889 until 1893 Butler worked in collaboration with Beverely Ussher. In 1896 George C. Inskip joined his practice, however their association ended in 1905 after a disagreement with the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects over the conduct of a competition. In 1907-16 he partnered Ernest R. Bradshaw and after World War I he was in association with his nephew Richard (b. 1892) as W. & R. Butler, which shortly included Marcus Martin. In the late 1930s Butler was in partnership with Hugh Pettit before retiring when Pettit enlisted for World War II. Notable projects Mission to Seamen, Flinders St, Docklands The Missions to Seamen (1916) In 1916 Walter Butler designed the Anglican mission building located on 717 Flinders Street Docklands. It was designed in a mixture of styles one being in the style of Spanish mission revival, which was prevalent during the 1890s, and his immense experience in the arts and craft architecture. What made The Missions to Seamen building so significant was the introduction of the Spanish Mission style to Melbourne. The revival of this building is evident in its bell tower with its pinnacles, its rough-hewn timber trusses, and the monastic- like courtyard. This style soon after became popular in the Melbourne suburbs.Victorian Heritage database, http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritage#detail_places;756 David Syme Tomb, Kew David Syme Tomb (1908) Walter Butler was selected to carry out the commissioning of this tomb situated in Boroondara Cemetery in Kew. The tomb was designed similarly to an Egyptian temple, only smaller and encompassing a similar symbolic context. Butler ensured that the symbolism best represented Symes character merged with his growing interest in iconography architecture.Edquist, He who sleeps in Philae: Walter Butler‚Äôs tomb for David Syme at Kew, Fabrications, Vol 13, no 1, June 2003. Edzell Mansion, Toorak Edzell Mansion (1892) Located in Toorak along the Southbank of the Yarra River, the Edzell mansion can be said to be one of Tooraks grandest mansions. It was originally designed by the architects Reed Smart and Tappin and in 1917 Butler designed extensions to the mansion including a ballroom and an additional garden to the property. What makes this mansion so significant is the mixture of architectural styles by prominent architects.Edzell: On my doorstep, http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/1167/edzell Other projectsAustralian Dictionary online, http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070514b.htm : Houses/mansions *Blackwood (1891) near Penshurst for R.B.

Officially founded in 1888, the NCW/US is an accredited non-governmental organization (NGO) with the Department of Public Information (UN/DPI) and in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). Establishment During the preparations of 1887‚Äì1888 for the meeting of the International Council of Women, May Wright Sewall, an active member of the Committee of Arrangements, conceived the idea of finalizing the results of that gathering of women into permanent organizations dedicated to the uplifting of humanity. From her carefully elaborated thought arose the permanent International Council of Women and the National Council of Women of the United States, both organized, and their central boards of officers elected, March 31, 1888, in Washington, D.C.. The first official officers of the National Council of Women of the United States were Frances Willard, President; Susan B. Anthony, Vice President; Mary F. Eastman, Recording Secretary; M. Louise Thomas, Treasurer (NOTE: the photo above is of \\"Minnie\\" Louise Thomas, of St. Louis, not Maria Louise Palmer Thomas (1825‚Äì1907) of Philadelphia, who was affiliated with NCW of US.); May Wright Sewall, Corresponding Secretary. They adopted and presented the following preamble: :\\"We, women of the United States of America, believing that the best good of humanity will be advanced by efforts toward greater unity of sympathy and purpose, and that a voluntary association of individuals so united will best serve the highest good of the family, the community, the state, do hereby freely band ourselves together into a federation of all races, creeds, and traditions, to further the application of the Golden Rule to society, custom, and law.\\" All national organisations of women, interested in the advancement of women's work in education, philanthropy, reform, and social culture, were welcome to join. When an organization entered the council, its president became an acting vice- president in the council, and it also had the right to appoint one person to represent it on the executive board of the council. This board included the general officers of the council, together with the presidents of all organisations belonging to it, and one delegate besides its president from every organisation. This board also constituted a committee of arrangements for the first triennial meeting of the council. The constitution of the NCW/US called for triennial meetings of this organization to be held at Washington, D.C. At the close of the various business meetings of 1888 connected with the International Council of Women, it was agreed that the NCW/US would hold the first of the triennial meeting, provided for by its constitution, in February 1891 at the Albaugh's Opera House. The central board of officers was responsible for arranging this meeting.  Present day  Today, the National Council of Women of the United States works to address the diverse concerns of women in pursuit of social, economic and political equality while serving as a united voice and forum to promote progressive ideas and influence policy decisions that impact human rights. They represent all races, creeds and traditions. The National Council of Women of the United States, along with its member organizations and individual members, continues today to uphold their mission statement: to further the application of the Golden Rule to society, custom, and law. During the annual United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the Council serves as host to hundreds of women from all over the world, introducing them to the United Nations as an organized body of 192 nations with many Commissions, Conventions and Treaties that impact women and children here and across the globe. Monitoring the United Nations and reporting on current issues and activities, they also develop, implement and present public interest seminars and workshops.  Member organizations  The National Council of Women is an affiliate of the International Council of Women. The following organizations are affiliates of the National Council of Women/US: NANBPWC, Delta Sigma Theta sorority, Nation to Nation Networking, Knowledge iTrust, Pan-Pacific and Southeast Asia Women's Association, Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, Sister To Sister International, Soroptimist International, Ukrainian National Women's League of America, International Health Awareness Network, National Council of Ghanaian Associations, United Nations Association of America (Tampa Bay, FL Chapter), Voices of African Mothers, and Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

Belshazzar's Feast (), JS 48, is incidental music by Jean Sibelius to a play of the same name by the journalist, poet and playwright (1868‚àí1927). History Sibelius composed in 1906 eight movements, scored for orchestra, with singers also being required in some numbers. The first performance of the play and its incidental music was at the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki on 7 November 1906, conducted by the composer. It had 21 performances through to January 1907. In 1907 Sibelius extracted a purely orchestral suite of four numbers, which is much better known than the original score.Jean Sibelius: The music The suite has the opus number 51. It had its first performance in Helsinki on 25 September 1907, in the same concert as the premiere of the Third Symphony; the Orchestra of the Helsinki Philharmonic Society was again conducted by the composer. He also made a piano arrangement of the suite in 1907. The Jewish Girl's Song ('), Number 2b of the original score, existed in a number of versions. It was originally written for flute and orchestra. In 1907 it became the second movement, Solitude, of the orchestral suite. In the same year Sibelius arranged it as a song for voice and piano. In 1939, he arranged it for voice and orchestra for the American contralto Marian Anderson, under the title \\"Solitude\\".Jean Sibelius: The music The suite has had a number of recordings, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Neeme J√§rvi, Pietari Inkinen and others. The full original score had its world premiere recording by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Lilli Paasikivi (mezzo-soprano), Petri Lehto (tenor), Sauli Tiilikainen (baritone), Lahti Chamber Choir, conducted by Osmo V√§nsk√§, as part of BIS Records' Complete Sibelius Edition.

Viewing the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence as a measure of distance, the I-projection p^* is the \\"closest\\" distribution to q of all the distributions in P. The I-projection is useful in setting up information geometry, notably because of the following inequality, valid when P is convex: \\\\operatorname{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(pq) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(pp^*) + \\\\operatorname{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(p^*q) This inequality can be interpreted as an information-geometric version of Pythagoras' triangle inequality theorem, where KL divergence is viewed as squared distance in a Euclidean space. It is worthwhile to note that since \\\\operatorname{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(pq) \\\\geq 0 and continuous in p, if P is closed and non-empty, then there exists at least one minimizer to the optimization problem framed above. Furthermore, if P is convex, then the optimum distribution is unique. The reverse I-projection also known as moment projection or M-projection is p^* = \\\\underset{p \\\\in P}{\\\\arg\\\\min} \\\\operatorname{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(qp) Since the KL divergence is not symmetric in its arguments, the I-projection and the M-projection will exhibit different behavior. For I-projection, p(x) will typically under- estimate the support of q(x) and will lock onto one of its modes. This is due to p(x)=0 , whenever q(x)=0 to make sure KL divergence stays finite. For M-projection, p(x) will typically over-estimate the support of q(x) . This is due to p(x) > 0 whenever q(x) > 0 to make sure KL divergence stays finite. The concept of information projection can be extended to arbitrary statistical f-divergences and other divergences. See also *Sanov's theorem References *K.

It is a significant producer of coated paper for inkjet printing, artist's paper for traditional painting and printing techniques, and filter paper for industry and research. History The company traces its origins to the construction of a paper mill by Merton Speiss on February 27, 1584 in Relliehausen at the source of a river in the Solling (a range of hills). The filtration effect from the Solling's sandstone had a softening effect on the pure spring water leading to paper of exceptional quality. This is but one of many such paper mills known to have existed in the vicinity of Dassel between the Weser and the Leine rivers, but it is the only one to have survived over the centuries. Paper making by hand in the founders' days of Hahnem√ºhle paper mill On August 30, 1769, the descendants of the Spiess family sold the mill to Peter Johann Jacob Heinrich Andrae from Osterode for 4,500 Reichsthaler. Andrae suffered an early death, and the mill passed to his son. On August 13, 1884 Oskar Andrae sold the firm to H. J. Heinemann of Hannover who immediately began the construction of a new production facility. Unforeseen difficulties and costs forced Heinemann to give up the factory, and it was sold in 1886 to Carl Hahne who renamed the mill into ‚ÄúB√ºttenpapierfabrik Hahnem√ºhle‚Äù. In 1902 Hahnem√ºhle was converted into a limited company (GmbH) and merged with Schleicher & Schuell, a company from D√ºren. In 2004 Hahnem√ºhle was demerged from Schleicher & Schuell and operates independently since then. During the Second World War, the company created paper for the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt's efforts to produce counterfeit British banknotes as part of Operation Bernhard. Today, the firm employs approximately 200 employees worldwide in the production of paper for painters, graphic artists, illustrators, bookbinders, photographers and printmaker as well as for the production of specialty papers in industrial applications (such as filter membranes for chemical and biological analysis). The paper factory is especially known for its high quality artist papers for painting and printmaking.

Ibn Hisham also refers to this as Abdullah b. Rawaha's raid to kill al-Yusayr b. Rizam. The assassination was successful, and ibn Rizam was killed as well has 29 of his followers. Assassination of Al-Yusayr ibn Rizam The assassination of Abu Rafi did not relieve Muhammad of his apprehensions. Muhammad did not feel safe from the Jews of Khaybar. Al-Yusayr ibn Rizam was elected the new chief of the Khaybar Jews. He maintained the same good relations with the Banu Ghatafan that his predecessor Abu Rafi had. Muhammad heard that Al-Yusayr ibn Rizam was planning a fresh attack against him. So he deputed Abdallah ibn Rawaha, a leader of the Banu Khazraj, and sent him with three followers to Khaybar to gather intelligence on how Al-Yusayr may be taken unaware and assassinated. But Abdullah ibn Rawaha found the Jews to be extremely alert for this second assassination to be a success. When he returned to Medina a new strategy was devised, Muhammad again sent him openly with 30 men mounted on camels to persuade al-Yusayr to visit Medina. When they arrived, they assured Yusayr they will make him the ruler of Khaybar and would treat him well, giving al-Yusayr ibn Rizam a solemn guarantee of his safety. So he was mounted on the horse of Abdullah ibn Unais and the Muslims rode behind him. When they arrived at al-Qarqarat, about six miles from Khaybar, al-Yusayr suspected the plans of the Muslims and changed his mind about going to meet Muhammad. He dismounted from the beast he was riding with Abdullah ibn Unais. Abdullah ibn Unais perceived that al-Yusayr was drawing his sword. So he rushed at him and hit him with a deadly blow on his hip joint. Al-Yusayr fell wounded on the floor but hit Abdullah ibn Unais and wounded him with a camel staff, the only weapon within his reach. This was a signal for the Muslims to attack, each of the Muslims killed the Jews on the camels in front of them, one behind the other. The Muslims killed all the Jews, except one who escaped.

Traditional principles are largely influenced by the folk beliefs in Central and North Thailand, and modern practices by the western medical model. Background=Health and illness theories Traditional Thai medicine is based on the mixed indigenous traditions of Indian, Chinese, and Khmer influences. Historically, Jivaka Kumar Bhaccha is considered the \\"Father Doctor\\" of Thai medicine. The \\"circle of life\\" is a central concept in Thai medical philosophy, which involves the three essences of the human body that must be kept in balance to maintain health. The three essences are: (1) Energy (holds mind, body, and heart together, similar to qi/chi/prana), (2) Body (physical substance), and (3) Citta (mind/heart, non-physical being that holds all thoughts, emotions, spirit, inner self). Thai traditional medicine has three branches that correspond to the three essences: Thai massage, herbalism (including dietary regimen), and spiritual or religious healing. The three branches are used to balance each of the essences. For example, there are ten tastes of foods and herbs that are recognized by the Thai medicine, and tastes opposite of the disease process would be used to treat it. Similarly, the four elements of the body (fire, water, air, and earth) must be kept in balance by eating certain foods. Women's health statistics Female life expectancy at birth in Thailand is 76.08 years (as compared to 71.24 years for men). Two percent of Thai women smoke. The current (2011) birth rate is estimated to be 12.95 births per 1,000 population. The maternal mortality ratio is 20.63 per 100,000 live births, and the major causes of maternal death are hemorrhage (27.8%), sepsis (8.73%), toxemia (16.7%), amniotic fluid embolism (11.9%), and other causes (8.73%) (2003). A high percentage of laboring women (97%) are attended by skilled health personnel, which is much higher than the regional average (49%) (2008). Women in Thailand are also much more likely to attend four or more ante-natal visits (74%) compared to women in other countries in Southeast Asia (43%) and use contraception (81% compared to 58%) (2008). The under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live births) has decreased to 14 (2008) from 28 (2002). Infant mortality has also decreased from 20 (2002) to 16.39 deaths per 1000 births (2011). Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs Krasue, a nocturnal ghost of Thai folklore haunting pregnant village women There are many traditional beliefs associated with the way pregnancy should be carried out. According to the central Thai beliefs, conception occurs when a khwan (soul) flies into the womb during a sexual encounter. A woman whose period stops and who starts craving sour foods is thought to be pregnant. Once a woman finds out she is pregnant, she is to tell her partner first, followed by her mother and her mother-in-law. Infertility is seen as imbalance in one of the \\"essences\\". Certain acupressure points, however, are used to resolve the issue. Abortion is seen by Buddhists as \\"impeding an individual's rebirth and disobeying a religious prohibition on taking life\\" and it is currently illegal in Thailand. Only in the following three cases it is allowed: (1) if mother's life is in danger, (2) if mother's physical or mental health is at risk, or (3) if the pregnancy is a result of an offense or seduction of a girl under 15. However, about two-thirds of women seek help outside of the main healthcare system to terminate the unplanned pregnancy, and 12% attempt to do it themselves. In Thai folklore there is a ghost known as Krasue (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏≠) who haunts pregnant women in their homes just before or after the childbirth.Phraya Anuman Rajadhon, Essays on Thai Folklore, Editions Duang Kamol, Village legends say that it hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instill fear. It uses an elongated proboscis- like tongueKrasue tongueKrasue tongue extended to reach the fetus or its placenta within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting mainly rural women during their pregnancy. Diet during pregnancy Since pregnancy is considered to be a \\"hot\\" condition in Thai medicine, foods to maintain warmth are preferred, such as ginger tea, coconut milk, young coconut meat, salty foods, tamarind, fish, garlic, onion, and warm liquids. Those who consume pak plang, a slippery vine-like green vegetable, will have an easy birth, since it will make the baby's body slippery. Ya tom herbal medicine could be prepared as tea and would make the baby strong and easy to deliver if the pregnant woman drinks the tea three times a day for three consecutive days. However, khong salaeng (allergic foodstuffs) must be avoided by pregnant women, since it may cause unwanted problems during labor or for the unborn child. Khong salaeng foods include papaya salad, pickled food, spicy hot food (baby may be born hairless), coffee and tea (baby will be not intelligent), shellfish (prevents perineum from drying after delivery), and Thai eggplants (may cause anal pain after delivery). Women are also advised to eat only half a banana, since birth may become obstructed if she eats a whole banana. Behavior during pregnancy According to traditional beliefs, strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, farm work, and even driving a car may lead to a miscarriage or stillbirth, however this may sometimes be unavoidable by the rural poor. Regular activity, however, would promote easy birth by making the abdomen \\"loose\\" (tong klon) and therefore aiding in the downward rotation of the baby. Idleness and frequent resting, on the other hand, complicates birth. There are accounts that sexual activity was promoted during pregnancy in central Thailand since sperm would make the baby strong, however, in the northern parts of Thailand it is seen as a form of vigorous activity that may result in miscarriage. Although pregnant women are prohibited from attending a funeral, wearing a brooch on the abdomen would counteract any negative effects on the fetus. Women should also not make any advanced preparations, such as buying or making baby clothes, as this may result the death of the baby. Other pregnancy-related beliefs include not sitting in the stairway (causes obstructed birth), not burying anything in the soil (difficult birth), and having \\"magical showers\\" (to promote easy delivery and emotional calmness). These showers should be blessed with sacred words known as nam mon by mor mon' (a magical healer, or even a monk); they are usually done in an open-aired space from the eighth to ninth month of pregnancy. During the last weeks of normal pregnancy, a woman may choose to go to a masseuse for \\"lifting of the uterus (yok thong) to increase comfort\\". Modern pregnancy Today, pregnancy test kits are available at pharmacies. Pregnancy can also be confirmed at a gynecologist's office using blood and urine tests. Currently, pregnant women are required to attend at least four ante-natal visits. Normal pregnancies can be managed by gynecological nurses or midwives, while high- risk pregnancies must be monitored by obstetricians. Ideally, a woman would attend ante-natal check-ups \\"every month until 28 weeks of gestation, then every fortnight from 28‚Äì32 weeks and every week after 32 weeks\\", however, the number of visits will depend on the woman and her healthcare providers. In Thailand, ante-natal care is free in the public health services sector. There is a private and public sector in healthcare, the latter provided by the Ministry of Public Health and teaching hospitals. In the 2005 study by Liamputtong, et al., women of Chiang Mai (northern Thailand) revealed that they \\"only incorporate cultural knowledge when it is practicable and suitable to their daily living situations\\". Labor and birth=Setting In the 1960s, 99% of the women in villages gave birth at home. Today the number is much lower, as most Thai women give birth in hospitals and clinics, generally where they go for ante-natal care. However, homebirths are becoming popular, but they may not be fully covered by insurance policies. Traditionally, Thai women would give birth at home, either in the bedroom or the kitchen. The delivery room at home is usually decorated with Yant Trinisingh√©, \\"small flags inscribed with sacred numbers from one to nine\\" or with letters and signs; each flag is a \\"symbol of a long mantra passage, believed to have power to ward off evil spirits\\". Buffalo leather can be used instead of flags. Birth assistant and attendants According to WHO's 2008 Thailand health profile, 99% of urban, 97% or rural, and 93% of the poorest 20% of women have their children delivered by skilled health persons, which is a much better compared to the regional average of 49%. As a part of the four-year curriculum, all nurses go through half a year of midwifery training, and may later choose to specialize. However, an obstetrician carries most responsibility during a birth in the hospitals It is unclear how the traditional delivery assistants are trained, but most likely through observational experiences. The traditional delivery assistant, who is usually a woman, is called Mo Tamaye in the central Thailand and Mae Jang in the north. It is generally accepted that labor starts when the water breaks. If the family cannot get to the nearest medical facility, or does not want to, Mo Tamaye is called. Usually, the husband and Mo Tamaye are present during delivery, but relatives and children may attend as well; however, the woman in labor must be covered from the waist to knee. Birth positions There are variations in the traditional birthing positions. In one, a folded mattress would be supporting a woman's back while her husband would provide support sitting behind her and letting her grab onto his thighs. There would be foot supports made out of bamboo that a woman can push on during contractions. In another position, a woman would be sitting, with Mo Tamaye supporting her from behind, and would pull on a rope that is hanging from the ceiling to alleviate some pain. The woman must take an active role in the process by breathing and pushing with contractions, with the help of Mo Tamaye. In a medical setting, a woman would most likely have limited options for positions and would be laid flat on the bed to deliver. Culturally, there is no need to keep silent during the birthing process, but pain management is available in most clinics. There are no data regarding the use of fetal monitoring; however, it is likely used in the westernized hospital settings, which would limit woman's mobility during labor. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital https://www.samitivejhospitals.com/srinakarin/ in Bangkok is currently the only hospital in the country that offers natural and water birth. Traditions during labor In case of birth complications, the traditional birth assistant would give the woman some holy water or press on her belly. There were no specific foods mentioned to eat during labor. To promote an easy delivery, all windows and doors must be open and the woman must be facing east to symbolize the emergence of new life. The husband should also pile logs outside facing east. Any fastened nails must be undone, and no one should be nailing nails to avoid stalled birth. To be born with an umbilical (holy) cord wrapped abound neck was considered a sign of fortune. Caesarean section In the medical model of pregnancy, Caesarean section is performed should complications arise. However, the rate of C-sections has been increasing globally, which may be due to financial incentives. Thailand is no exception, with rates rising from 15.2% (1990) to 22.4% (1996) to 34% (2007). A study in 2000 concluded that \\"private cases have a 5.83 higher chance of primary cesarean section than non-private cases\\" because \\"physicians feel obliged to provide personal delivery services, when triggered by leisure and time conflict, [which] leads to higher and possibly unnecessary cesarean procedures\\". Postpartum The postpartum period begins right after the birth of the child, but it is not specified when it ends. It takes place at home following home birth, or in the hospital for 2‚Äì3 days and then at home following hospital birth. The cord and placenta Following a traditional delivery, Mo Tamaye would milk the umbilical cord three times away from the baby ‚Äúto remove dirt,‚Äù then push it back, tie the cord in two places with a special cotton string, and cut the cord in between the two fastened places. The cut cord is then burned, and placenta is buried, usually by the father. Woman's rite of passage After a woman gives birth to her first child, she is considered an adult. She then undergoes the Yu Fai when she must \\"lie near fire\\" for an odd number of days, usually around 11 days, so that her uterus will shrink back to normal size. After each following birth, the number of days spent near fire may be decreased. Also, a wooden box with a fire pot may be placed on the woman's stomach to serve the same purpose. Fire is also said to scare off evil spirits, especially combined with the lemongrass aroma. After a Yu Fai, a woman is allowed to move out of her parents' residence, where she would live before and during the pregnancy, since she is now a mature adult. Postpartum diet and behavior As with the pregnancy diet, warm foods are encouraged, such as hot curries. A woman's diet must consist of rice and vegetables in the first few months after pregnancy; meat, with exception of fish, must be avoided. From a traditional Thai medicine perspective, \\"sour tastes [do] not dry out the body, but built up water; egg [is] too cooling; jackfruit [brings] in wind [air]; glutinous rice and the sugar of sweets wet the uterus; fruits [do] not give strength and [are] excessively cooling\\". Herbal teas (naam puu loey) should be consumed, and showers with herbal water (naam puu loeyand naam bai paw) should be taken daily without washing hair the first two weeks. Postnatal care and maternal leave Household duties would be taken care by female relatives, and older children. Traditionally, female relatives would also check on the new mother. Within 4 to 8 weeks a woman must attend a health clinic for a check-up and to register her child's birth. Labour Protection Act of 1998 guarantees women to have three months of maternity leave, to retain the job a woman had prior to pregnancy, and to temporary change duties with a doctor's letter. In practice, labor rights are very weak in Thailand and these laws are not generally enforceable. Labor activists are prosecuted, migrant laborers are exploited, and trafficked workers in the sex and fishing industries are common. Newborn=Traditional rituals There are many variations in tradition across Thailand most include the beautification of the child. Central Thai people say the baby is tog fag (falls on bamboo) when he or she is born. After Mo Tamaye cuts the umbilical cord, she washes and beautifies the baby with yellow and white powder. On the third day after birth, the Lon Dek Nai Kadon rite (translates to \\"rock the cradle in which a new born baby is sleeping\\") is carried out. A baby is placed into a basket with a pencil and a notebook (for brightness) and money (for richness); girls are also given knives (to cut and comb hair) (Attagara 1968, p. 103) and cooking utensils. The basket with the baby and instruments is then handed over to \\"a respectable man in the village\\". This means that the baby became his adopted child temporarily, which reflects that the parents expect their baby to be rich and respectable like the adoptive.‚Äù Another tradition includes making offerings at a temple (wat) on the third day after the baby is born to obtain a blessing from a monk. The \\"fire shaving ceremony\\" takes place when the child reaches the age of one month and one day, which involves cutting of the baby's hair. As a precaution, babies must be kept away from the rain. Circumcision is not very prevalent in Thailand; only 13% of Thai male population are circumcised. It is not specified when the newborn period ends. There is also no information on the significance of vernix, the baby's rest, activity, and movement, as well as meconium and handling of the urine and feces. Care for the baby For the first month of the baby's life, the mother must stay very close and \\"breastfeed the newborn on its slightest demand\\". Babies are also sometimes given a mixture of banana, honey, and water to prevent diarrhea. If the baby cries too much and cannot sleep, it is believed that the baby's guardian spirit, Mae Sue, is teasing the newborn too much. Usual interaction with Mae Sue is normal, during which the baby will play and laugh by itself. Naming Traditionally, a name is given to the child on the fourth or fifth day after birth by the father, however, there are variations in this practice across Thailand. Today, both the mother and father can take part in deciding on a name. A child may not hold the same name as royalty. Twins There is a variation in the view of twins. While some view twins as needing more resources and being too demanding on a family, others see having twins as lucky, since it is convenient to take care of them at the same time. Modern newborn care An infant is examined in the first week of life followed by six examinations in the first year. There are three examinations during the second year, and six examinations every other year until the child turns six. Vaccines coincide with the exams, but are not obligatory except for the BCG for tuberculosis prevention.

Chungcheong dialect can be divided into two categories: the Northern Chungcheong dialect, notable for its similarity capital Gyeonggi region speech, and the Southern dialect, which is similar to the Jeolla dialect. This dialect is notable for its slow enunciations, vowel changes, and unique jargon. However, due to the proliferation of Seoul standardization in cities such as Daejon, Chungcheong dialect is difficult to hear outside of the rural regions of the province.  Pronunciation = Vowels  Similar to the Jeolla dialect, Chungcheong dialect often transforms the vowel <„Öê> with <„Öï>instead of <„Öë>, which may be more common in other dialects. Linguist Do Suhee reports that the Chungcheong dialect experiences a vowel shift that raises vowels to place them further forward in the mouth towards the front, resulting in changes like <„Öè> (a) raising to <„Öî> (e) and <„Ö°> (…®) fronting to become <„Ö£> (i).  Consonants  Do Suhee found that the Chungcheong dialect increases the tenseness of lax stops when in the initial position. For example, the lax stops <„Ñ±,„Ñ∑,„ÖÇ> (k, t, p) transform into /„Ñ≤, „Ñ∏, „ÖÉ/ (kk, tt, pp) when in the word-initial position.  Distinct Phrases  The Chungcheong dialect usually replaces the standard '~Í≤†Îã§' (gettda) at the end of sentences with '~Í≤ÉÎã§' (geotda) and uses phrases such as 'Í∏∞Ïó¨' (giyeo) (yes) instead of the standard 'ÎßûÎã§' (matda) and 'Í∑ºÎîî'(geundi) (but) instead of 'Í∑∏Îü∞Îç∞' (geureonde).

Psychoanalysis Freud used the term 'to describe the turning back of the individual's libido from the object onto themselves....as the equivalent of narcissistic regression'. On Narcissism saw him explore the idea through an examination of such everyday events as illness or sleep: 'the condition of sleep, too, resembles illness in implying a narcissistic withdrawal of the positions of the libido on to the subject's own self'.Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 76 A few years later, in '\\"Mourning and Melancholia\\"...Freud's most profound contribution to object relations theory',James Grotstein, in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. xi he examined how 'a withdrawal of the libido...on a narcissistic basis' in depression could allow both a freezing and a preservation of affection: 'by taking flight into the ego love escapes extinction'.Freud, Metapsychology p. 57-8 and p. 267 Otto Fenichel would extend his analysis to borderline conditions, demonstrating how 'in a reactive withdrawal of libido...a regression to narcissism is also a regression to the primal narcissistic omnipotence which makes its reappearance in the form of megalomania'.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 419-20 For Melanie Klein, however, a more positive element came to the fore: 'frustration, which stimulates narcissistic withdrawal, is also...a fundamental factor in adaptation to reality'.Quoted in Pearl King/Riccardo Steiner, The Freud-Klein Controversies (1992) p. 802 Similarly, 'Winnicott points out that there is an aspect of withdrawal that is healthy', considering that it might be '\\"helpful to think of withdrawal as a condition in which the person concerned (child or adult) holds a regressed part of the self and nurses it, at the expense of external relationships\\"'.J. Abram/K. Hjulmand, The Language of Winnicott (2007) p. 45 and p. 293 However, from the mid-20th century onwards, attention has increasingly focused on 'the case in which the subject appeals to narcissistic withdrawal as a defensive solution...a precarious refuge that comes into being as a defense against a disappointing or untrustworthy object. This is found in studies of narcissistic personalities or borderline pathologies by authors such as Heinz Kohut or Otto Kernberg'. Kohut considered that 'the narcissistically vulnerable individual responds to actual (or anticipated) narcissistic injury either with shamefaced withdrawal or with narcissistic rage'.Brian W. Shaffer, The Blinding Torch (1993) p. 151 Kernberg saw the difference between normal narcissism and ' pathological narcissism...[as] withdrawal into \\"splendid isolation\\"'Salman Akhtar, Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (2009) p. 190 in the latter instance; while Herbert Rosenfeld was concerned with 'states of withdrawal commonly seen in narcissistic patients in which death is idealised as superior to life', as well as with 'the alternation of states of narcissistic withdrawal and ego disintegration'.John Steiner/Herbert A. Rosenfeld, Rosenfeld in Retrospective (2008) p. 66 and p.95 Schizoid withdrawal Closely related to narcissistic withdrawal is 'schizoid withdrawal: the escape from too great pressure by abolishing emotional relationships altogether'.Josephine Klein, Our Need for Others (London 1994) p. 421 All such 'fantastic refuges from need are forms of emotional starvation, megalomanias and distortions of reality born of fear'.Adam Phillips, The Beast in the Nursery (London 1998) p. 3 Sociology 'Narcissists will isolate themselves, leave their families, ignore others, do anything to preserve a special...sense of self'Joan Lachkar, The Narcissisitic/Borderline Couple (1992) p. 82 Arguably, however, all such 'narcissistic withdrawal is haunted by its alter ego: the ghost of a full social presence'James Booth, New Larkins for Old (2000) p. 42 \\\\- with people living their lives 'along a continuum which ranges from the maximal degree of social commitment...to a maximal degree of social withdrawal'.John O'Neill, Sociology as Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 171-2 If 'of all modes of narcissistic withdrawal, depression is the most crippling',Harold Barrett, Rhetoric and Civility (1991) p. 52 a contributing factor may be that 'depressed persons come to appreciate consciously how much social effort is in fact required in the normal course of keeping one's usual place in undertakings'.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (Penguin 1972) p. 448n Therapy Object relations theory would see the process of therapy as one whereby the therapist enabled his or her patient to have 'resituated the object from the purely schizoid usage to the shared schizoid usage (initially) until eventually...the object relation - discussing, arguing, idealizing, hating, etc. - emerged'.Christopher Bollas, Cracking Up (London 1995) p. 86 Fenichel considered that in patients where 'their narcissistic regression is a reaction to narcissistic injuries; if they are shown this fact and given time to face the real injuries and to develop other types of reaction, they may be helped enormously'Fenichel, p. 451 Neville Symington however estimated that 'often a kind of war develops between analyst and patient, with the analyst trying to haul the patient out of the cocoon...his narcissistic envelope...and the patient pulling for all his worth in the other direction'.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. 77 Cultural analogues * In I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, the therapist of the protagonist wonders '\\"if there is a pattern....You give up a secret to our view and then you get so scared that you run for cover into your panic or into your secret world.

The Globe and Mail, January 6, 2005, as reprinted in Mark McLean . Retrieved 2011-04-25. His success as a Canadian black musician is considered to have influenced the success of later Canadian black musicians. History Cy McLean was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and relocated to Toronto, Ontario. He formed his first band as of 1937. He was a pianist, who supported himself as a musician through working as a messenger at the Toronto head office of Bell Canada. He became known as the leader of Toronto's first black dance band and, as of the 1940s, led Canada's only full- scale black orchestra. McLean is credited with training many Canadian jazz musicians of his time. He and his band developed their music career through playing at non-union establishments, due to being unable to join the local musicians union. The band became quite popular, and during World War II was sponsored by Lifebouy Soap to tour southwestern Ontario. McLean and his band played in areas of Ontario where a black person had not been seen before. He and his band were sometimes barred from restaurants, in addition to being initially denied union membership. Despite these events, McLean chose to perform exclusively in Canada, stating that \\"people (in Canada) aren't like they are in the United States. I've never wanted to go down there, for that reason.\\"Jet Magazine, \\"Moonlight\\" band leader prefers Canada to U.S., December 27, 1962. Retrieved 2011-04-26.

This was considered to be a groundbreaking engagement, since black musicians had heretofore not been allowed to perform at any of the clubs on Toronto's Yonge Street, which was at the time the central focus of live music in Toronto. McLean was a significant influence on other musicians, both generally and among black musicians facing colour barriers, such as drummer Archie Alleyne.In Our Own Words, Archie Alleyne: Pass it on, February 3, 2009. Retrieved 2011-04-26. In his later career, McLean was performing five nights a week at Toronto's Warwick Hotel, prior to dance bands being replaced by other entertainment. McLean was the great uncle of Canadian drummer Mark McLean.

The first form is an unintentional fall/crash (loss of control) through loss of balance, foot/object contact with wheel, loss of traction, speed wobbles, etc. The second form is a controlled bail, which implies some level of control loss, but is not considered to be an especially painful bail as injury level is reduced.

History  The origin of the name dates from the founding of Sorocaba 1654 by Baltasar Fernandes and as the aim was to transform the local village, built a chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Ponte. Esteves Br√°s Leme stood near the mouth of the Sarapu√≠ River and his son-Pascoal Moreira Cabral Leme in place that would be called Serra de S√£o Francisco (Votorantim).

It is a biotite granite dominant pink color, composition syenogranitic with fluorite as locally accessory amphibole and sodic. It subalkaline nature, type A, with locally rapakivi texture. Form extensive fields and rocky boulders. The age of this granite is Neoproterozoic, estimated at 560 million years. It is one of the granites with high natural radioactivity of the state of Sao Paulo, either by their frequent exposure of rocky, with fractures, either by the same mineralogical composition. The highest values of natural radioactivity are recorded in the canyon of the Sorocaba River, downstream from the Dam Itupararanga. At the time of World War II was to search tungsten in the S√£o Francisco Ridge. The work was done by geologist Theodoro Knecht, who described the mineral occurrences of tin and wolframite in the western portion of the mountain, and endograisens associated with quartz veins. Adjacent to the northern flank of the S√£o Francisco ridge are the mining of limestone for cement Votorantim Group, the factories of St. Helena and Santa Rita, and other mines near the Pirapora river in the west part of the ridge. Along the eastern edge of the mountain is the municipality of Aluminium, next to the aluminium plant of Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio (CBA).  Geomorphology  The ridge is part of the Brazilian Highlands, where the basement crystalline rocks dominate and shape the Appalachian fall line, as defined by Professor Ab'Saber, being the limit with the low-lying areas of the Peripheral Depression, dominated the rocks of the Parana Basin, the latter with gentle slope and mound. The highest elevations in the S√£o Francisco ridge reach 1035 m (above sea level) in the eastern portion, near the headwaters of the river Pirajib√∫. The mountain becomes progressively lower toward Salto de Pirapora in the west, where the altitudes are located around 800 m in this region there is an intersection of the mountain by the Pirapora River. The region of the mountain is the source of the Sorocaba River, formed by the rivers Sorocabu√ßu and Sorocamirim. The Itupararanga Dam was built in Sorocaba river canyon. Dominate steep slopes on the north flank of the mountain, overlooking the Sorocaba and Votorantim, and softer on the south flank toward Piedade.  Environment  Much of the S√£o Francisco ridge is within the Environmental Protection Area (APA) of Itupararanga Dam that aims to protect all water sources, such as Itupararanga Dam. The site is of special ecological interest because it represents one of the last refuges of wild fauna and flora and the region. Because the saw is supported by granitic rocks dominate lithosols paved and rock, where there is lush vegetation, except in reforestation located. On the northern flank of the mountain there is intense mining activity.  Tourism and leisure  From the top of the mountain are views of the region of Sorocaba, including Ipanema Hill. In view of the foothills of S√£o Francisco ridge, from the higher parts of Sorocaba and Votorantim, the mountain appears to be majestic, and similarly, from the Chilena viewpoint high on the Ipanema Hill. In the higher parts of the mountain there is the Penha Chapel, rebuilt in 1724 by Tim de Oliveira, still exists today in the hills. It is a landmark of the region and has been held annually for Votorantim pilgrimage to the site.http://www.memoriaviva.org.br/default.asp?id=1&mnu;=1&ACT;=5&content;=1136 Pilgrimage to the Chapel Penha Near the Penha Chapel, given the strategic point for telecommunications, television towers had.

The streams forming from the east reach the Hunter River, and those from the west eventually flow to the Darling River. The flora of the area is an interesting combination of the moist mountain plants and those of the drier western plains. Vegetation is mostly dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris pine. The reserve is particularly noted for the high bird diversity. It lies within the Mudgee-Wollar Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for the endangered regent honeyeater. Typical mountain or eastern forest birds such as the superb lyrebird and satin bowerbird are present, as are emus and cockatiels, more usually seen west of the dividing range. Some 164 species of birds have been recorded. Facilities are present for birdwatchers.

He served as the second Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps.  Early life and education  George Bomford was born on Long Island, New York in 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, the son of a British officer, Thomas Bomford of the 60th Royal Artillery, and his wife.William Arba Ellis, ed., Norwich University, 1819-1911: Her History, Her Graduates, Her Roll of Honor, 3 vols., Montpelier: Grenville Dodge, 1911, v. 2, p. 67 His birth records do not indicate an exact date of birth nor the name of his father. Bomford later told his son James the information, who reported it in records at Norwich University. By a chance meeting, Bomford befriended the first graduate of West Point Joseph Gardner Swift. Swift sought and received a \\"Cadet's Warrant\\" from General Henry Dearborn for his friend, and Bomford was appointed to West Point from the state of New York on 23 October 1804, despite the circumstances of his birth.[Harrison Ellery, ed., The memoirs of Gen. Joseph Gardner Swift (Worcester Mass.: F.S. Blanchard, 1890), p. 40.]- See note: NGSQ p. 284. There is an error in the stated date of 1803 made by Swift or in West Point records. Career After graduating from West Point in 1805, as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, he served as assistant engineer in the defenses of New York Harbor under West Point superintendent and Chief of Engineers, Jonathan Williams (engineer) until 1808. From 1808 to 1810, Bomford served in the defenses of Chesapeake Bay. From 1810 to 1812 he served as the superintendent engineer of works on Governors Island in the construction of Castle Williams. At the start of the war of 1812‚Äì1815, Bomford was a staff major in the ordnance department and was appointed to the post of assistant commissary general of ordnance on 18 June 1812. On 6 July 1812 he was attached to the Corps of Engineers. After the war, on 9 February 1815 Bomford was promoted to lieutenant colonel. As an engineer, he and Joseph Gardner Swift were called upon to help rebuild the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., an effort that lasted from 1815 until 1819. Bomford was attached to the artillery when the army was reorganized in 1821 and the Ordnance Department and Artillery Departments were merged in the interest of economy. In 1832, the Ordnance Department was re-established as the Ordnance Corps (United States Army). At that time he was promoted to full colonel and appointed as the 2nd Chief of Ordnance on 30 May 1832. When General Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko died in 1817, despite writing four wills, two executors (including Thomas Jefferson) failed to act. By time the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1852 that the general died intestate and gave his money to his heirs, the value of his estate had decreased substantially; this was attributed by a case attorney to Colonel George Bomford's use of the estate for his own purposes.Alex Storozynski, \\"Kosciuszko Ksiaze chlopow\\", pages 111‚Äì112, W.A.B., 2011.

In 1811, Bomford developed the first heavy coastal defense howitzers that would come to be referred to as Columbiads. thumb 50-pounder Model 1811 Columbiad and center pivot mounting designed by George Bomford as an experimental coastal defense gun, photographed in Clear Lake, Wisconsin. This gun was built in 1811. Columbiad gun The heavy coastal defense howitzers designed by Bomford combined attributes of the gun, and the mortar, to produce a long-range, high-powered, anti-ship weapon. The first prototype guns of this type, Model 1811 produced by the Alger Foundry, came to be referred to as Columbiads after the epic poem by, and in honor of, Joel Barlow, poet and diplomat married to Bomford's wife's sister. Bomford and his wife Clara lived on the estate of Joel Barlow, known as \\"Kalorama\\".Kalorama estate article The army stationed 8-inch and 10-inch Columbiads Model 1844 around the country as a part of the Third System of Defense. Bomford's design was improved by the Navy's Dahlgren Gun, but was superseded by the Rodman gun (Thomas Jackson Rodman) of the Civil War. It was considered an improved Columbiad, especially the later models with rifled barrels. The Rodman Gun was considered more reliable than the larger sized Parrott rifles (which were eventually pulled from inventory) or the early Columbiads. Columbiads continued in operation until after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when they were rendered obsolete by the breech-loading rifled cannon. Marriage and family Shortly after graduating West Point, Bomford married Louisa Sophia Catton, daughter of the noted English artist Charles P. Catton.

The result The freeway revolt strengthened neighborhood organizations in Atlanta, which to this day exert relatively more influence in city decisions compared to other major US cities.\\"The Interstate that Almost Was\\", MLPA News, Fall 2003 Portions of the right of way where houses had been razed were used for parks: Sidney Marcus Park in Morningside, John Howell Memorial Park in Virginia Highland, and Freedom Park at the current eastern terminus of Freedom Parkway. The use of the north-south corridor for a road was a dead concept until GDOT brought it up again in 2010 in the form of a tunnel (see below); the discussion around a road in the east-west corridor was, however, to continue for another two decades.  Jimmy Carter's \\"Presidential Parkway\\" Plaque about CAUTION in Freedom Park just south of Ponce de Leon Ave. The land that was to become the east-west freeway lay empty through the 1980s as residents fought the construction of any road in the corridor. A \\"Presidential Parkway\\" was proposed as a smaller four-lane road to run from Downtown far into Druid Hills (see map). Citizens of neighborhoods along the corridor formed CAUTION (Citizens Against Unnecessary Thoroughfares in Older Neighborhoods) to fight the proposed Presidential Parkway which would have been an elevated multi-lane highway with limited access.T road's end: Transportation and land use choices for communities, Authors:Daniel Carlson, Surface Transportation Policy Project In 1981, ex-President Carter revived the idea of a highway along the east-west route to serve his planned presidential library and policy center on Copenhill. Carter originally bought only several acres of land. However the GDOT leased him 29 more acres in exchange for backing GDOT plans for a 2.9 mile east-west expressway, on the condition that if the road were not built, the Center would lose the land, i.e. its parking and gardens. Carter lobbied and won support from Mayor Young, the City Council and Chamber of Commerce. The road would connect the new Carter Center with downtown on the west, and to Druid Hills (and thus access to Emory University) to the east.\\"Dispute over road location stalls plan for Carter Library\\", Spokesman-Review, December 16, 1981 In 1984, Carter broke ground on the center, and construction resumed on the new \\"Presidential Parkway\\". However, CAUTION lobbied until 1991 to fight the Jimmy Carter-backed Expressway. In the end, only Jimmy Carter and GDOT supported a \\"Presidential Parkway\\". CAUTION, Lieutenant Governor Pierre Howard (D-Decatur), Mayor Maynard Jackson, and a majority of councilpersons were opposed, as well as elected officials at the county, state and federal levels. Only the announcement that Atlanta would host the 1996 Olympics broke the stalemate. Court-ordered mediation between representatives of GDOT, the City of Atlanta and CAUTION, reached a mediated settlement to an at-grade, meandering parkway surrounded by parkland. In 1991, compromise forged by Lt. Governor Howard and DOT Commissioner Wayne Shackleford, was reached to build the road as it exists today, and to the choice of the name \\"Freedom Parkway\\", in theory because it links the Carter Center with the Martin Luther King historic district.\\"Carter Center, Neighbors Agree To End Atlanta's Bitter Road War\\", Orlando Sentinel, September 29, 1991 During this time the term \\"Great Park\\" was also used to refer to the corridor. Eventually the four-lane Freedom Parkway was built from Downtown to Copenhill only, ending in a northern stub to Ponce de Leon Avenue near Barnett in Virginia Highland, and an eastern stub to Moreland Avenue in Poncey Highland at the Druid Hills border. Largely due to the efforts of Druid Hills, Inman Park, Candler Park, Lake Claire and Poncey Highland residents, who filed a lawsuit, the right-of-way east of Moreland became a park but without a roadway. Eastern part of Lakewood Freeway/Langford Parkway Langford Parkway, originally called the Lakewood Freeway (I-420) ‚Äì now part of Georgia 166 ‚Äì was to be built eastwards past its current terminus at the southern end of the Downtown Connector to connect to the north-south I-675 route, and then to meet I-20 near Gresham Park in south DeKalb (map of proposed route). 2010 plan for I-675 In 2010 a freeway to link GA-400 at Lindbergh with I-675 at the southeast Perimeter, again appeared on GDOT's list of potential projects, this time in the form whereby the intown portion would be in a 14.6 mile-long, 41 foot-wide tunnel. Rep. Pat Gardner held a meeting at Rock Springs Church in Morningside on January 4, 2010 with GDOT and Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) leaders, Mayor Kasim Reed, city councilmembers and assemblypersons. ARC Chairman Tad Leithead, while still wishing to study the proposal, noted preliminary evidence of a funding gap, very high ($8) tolls and a shortfall in traffic lanes, making it appear that the project \\"doesn't make any sense\\". This elicited cheers from the audience. Mayor Reed expressed his total opposition to the tunnel.Reed against Atlanta tunnel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 5, 2010\\"DOT: Atlanta opposition to tunnel does not kill idea\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 6, 2010 The Reason Foundation has also advocated for such a tunnel paid as part of larger plan to reduce congestion via tolls.\\"Reducing Congestion in Atlanta: A Bold New Approach to Increasing Mobility\\", The Galvin Mobility Project, By Robert W.

Bass notes can be acoustic, but within the term \\"bass song\\" they are usually synthesized, typically sine waves or very similar. Definition The term \\"bass song\\" typically refers to hip hop, trap, dubstep, techno, reggae, or other electronic music genres. However, there are cases where other genres and even acoustic music contain considerable bass content, either acoustically produced, or synthesized. The bass is occasionally in the original recording, but is more likely found in remixes. Certain types of these songs are usually played on, and sometimes specifically designed for, automobile sound systems with one or more subwoofers. There are other uses for bass songs as well, such as audio tech demos, nightclubs, and raves. Sometimes, a bass song is a specifically designed track for a certain arrangement of subwoofers or loudspeakers to achieve the maximum sound level possible. A bass song differs from a bass test in that a bass test is a recording where bass is the main point of the track, while in a bass song, the bass is still very prominent, yet remains supplemental to the rest of the song. Many bass songs utilize sub- bass frequencies ranging from 15 Hz to 80 Hz, which is the general operating range for a car subwoofer setup. Ported subwoofer enclosure tuning frequencies are usually within this range. A low frequency bassline in a bass song is usually created using a synthesizer to generate sine wave based tones, which sometimes has an acoustic or electronic kick drum sample layered on top of the attack transient. A baseline can also be created by pitch shifting an existing instrument sample, or using an acoustic bass instrument, and optionally applying a low-pass filter and/or equalization.

The district was first settled in the 1850s, and by 1909 a new settler named J.A. Atcheson wrote to the government asking for assistance with establishing a school and other facilities, and for a townsite to be declared. Following inspection some land near Slab Hut Gully was set aside for a townsite, which was locally known as Paul Valley. Lots were surveyed in 1910, and the Aboriginal name of Tulungup (from Teulungup) was proposed, but rejected by the Minister of Lands. The local residents then unanimously supported the name Tunney. The Minister of Lands then chose the name Nymbupp, but after stiff opposition from the locals eventually Tunney was used. The townsite was gazetted in 1912. The town was also known as Slab Hut. The name Tunney comes from the oldest local resident in the area at the time, James Tunney, who owned lands around the area in the 1880s. He was the son of Sergeant John Tunney who was an enrolled Pensioner Guard and had settled in the area in the 1860s. An agricultural hall was opened in the town in 1913 by Mr A.E. Piesse, in front of a large crowd, including Tunney. Tunney was presented with a set of pipes and his wife received a tea service from Piesse in recognition of all their contributions to the community, including the use of their house for town meetings.

A member of Ordo Templi Orientis since 1976 and a book designer by trade, he has written extensively on spiritual and political liberty. Publishing career Wasserman began working in 1973 at Weiser Books, then the world‚Äôs largest bookstore and publishing company to specialize in esoteric literature. While working at Weiser, he met and befriended filmmakers and occultists Harry Smith and Alejandro Jodorowsky. Wasserman worked with Brazilian occultist Marcelo Ramos Motta to publish the Commentaries of AL in 1975, for which he wrote the introduction. Additionally, he supervised the 1976 Weiser publication of The Book of the Law, the first popular edition to append the holograph manuscript to the typeset text. In 1977, Wasserman arranged to professionally re- photograph Frieda Harris' Tarot paintings for use in an improved second edition of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck, and also wrote the instruction booklet. Wasserman left Weiser in 1977 to found Studio 31, where he produced the Simon Necronomicon, a volume purporting to be the mythological Necronomicon made famous by Howard Philips Lovecraft. In 2008, it was reissued in a high-quality 31st anniversary edition by Ibis Press. In 1994, Wasserman assembled a team of scholars, photographers, and editorial staff to produce a full-color version of The Egyptian Book of the Dead featuring the Papyrus of Ani as discussed in In the Center of the Fire His edition of the Book of the Dead was described as offering \\"much of value in presentation, layout and commentary\\" by John Baines, professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford. In 2014, the Twentieth Anniversary Edition was completed, revised and expanded, adding: \\"Thoughts on this Twentieth Anniversary Edition\\" by James Wasserman; \\"Coming Forth Into the Day\\" by J.

This new edition includes some corrections and improvements to the color plates, and was completely recreated in electronic format. Ordo Templi Orientis A member of O.T.O. since 1976, Wasserman founded one of its oldest lodges, Tahuti Lodge, in New York City in 1979. He has played a key role within the Order in publishing the literary corpus of Aleister Crowley. In 1983, he worked with two other members of O.T.O. to produce The Holy Books of Thelema, a collection of Crowley‚Äôs Class A (inspired) writings. In 1986, his essay ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the History of the O.T.O.‚Äù appeared in The Equinox III, No. 10. In 2009, he and his wife Nancy published To Perfect This Feast, a performance commentary on the Gnostic Mass. Revised for a second edition in 2010, the book is now in its third and final edition, published 2013. Wasserman is described by Dan Burstein as \\"a founder of the modern Ordo Templi Orientis‚Äù in his guide to Dan Brown's novel Angels & Demons. In 2012, Wasserman wrote In the Center of the Fire, an extensive account of his own experiences in the development of the modern O.T.O. In 2015, he designed and produced a collection of essays for Ordo Templi Orientis published as Success Is Your Proof: One Hundred Years of O.T.O. in North America: A Festschrift in Honor of Hymenaeus Beta, Celebrating Thirty Years of Leadership. He contributed an essay entitled \\"The New Aeon in the New World: The Law of Liberty in the Wild West.\\" Eleven other ranking members of the Order contributed essays on a wide range of topics such as Thelemic doctrine, magical practices, Order history, and biographical treatments. Underlying philosophy Wasserman‚Äôs work in O.T.O. and his numerous writings point to a philosophy based on individual liberty and the opportunity for direct personal experience of God within. This more modern conception of Gnosticism dispenses with the myriad variations of the term as it is applied to numerous sub sects within major religions long ago. Modern Gnosticism simply presupposes the ability to forge a direct link with the highest level of divinity. Wasserman further advances the notion that political liberty offers humanity the best conditions for spiritual growth.Political Liberty as a Spiritual Value Public appearances Wasserman has appeared on several television networks including The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, National Geographic TV; and numerous radio broadcasts including NPR, Coast to Coast Radio, and 21st Century Radio.James Wasserman Media Page In 2009, he discussed his book Secrets of Masonic Washington at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. In 2012, his performance of Liber Israfel was broadcast on The Discovery Channel in a program entitled Secrets of Secret Societies. In 2013, Swirling Star Lodge filmed a 50-minute talk he presented on a modern history of the O.T.O, a supplement to In the Center of the Fire. In 2014, Swirling Star Lodge released a video of a performance of the Gnostic Mass based on the instructions in To Perfect This Feast In May 2015, Wasserman addressed the O.T.O. in Vancouver, British Columbia in celebration of its one hundredth year in North America.

Playing career=Manly-Warringah Oldfield played 34 games for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles National Youth Competition team over the 2009 and 2010 seasons, scoring 23 tries.Michael Oldfield Stats, rleague.com , retrieved 25 April 2011. Oldfield made his debut for Manly-Warringah in round 23 of the 2010 NRL season against the St George Illawarra Dragons. In 2011, in each of the games he played, he scored a try. Along with fullback Brett Stewart, Oldfield was regarded as one of the fastest runners not only at Manly but in the NRL. Oldfield traveled with the Sea Eagles to England and played in their 2012 World Club Challenge loss to the Leeds Rhinos before the start of the 2012 NRL season. It was hoped that the flying winger would be the club's permanent replacement for long-time left winger Michael Robertson, who had left the club following the 2011 NRL Grand Final victory. Despite scoring 6 tries for the Sea Eagles in 2012, Oldfield struggled to cement his place in Manly's first grade team and was soon replaced by powerhouse rookie Jorge Taufua. This saw Oldfield only playing in 7 games for the 2012 season. On 19 June 2012, it was announced that Oldfield had signed a two-year contract with the Sydney Roosters from 2013. Since the announcement, Oldfield was not selected in Manly's first grade team until called up due to an injury to David Williams just before the 2012 NRL Finals. Instead, finding himself in the Sea Eagles New South Wales Cup squad for most of the season.Roosters sign Oldfield from 2013 Sydney Roosters Oldfield signed with the Sydney Roosters for 2013. After making his club debut in a 22‚Äì24 loss to the Canberra Raiders at Canberra Stadium in round 5 of the 2013 NRL season in which he scored a try, Oldfield found himself playing in the NSW Cup for the Newtown Jets. On 20 April 2013, Oldfield, who is of Tongan heritage from his mother, made his international debut for Tonga in the Pacific Rugby League International against Samoa at Centrebet Stadium Penrith. Catalans Dragons In December 2013, Oldfield signed a two-year contract with the Catalans Dragons. In the 2014 season, Oldfield scored 12 tries in just 17 games. On 14 June 2014 against St Helens R.F.C., he scored a hat trick during Catalans Dragons' 42‚Äì0 home win. South Sydney On 6 October 2015, it was announced that Oldfield had signed a one-year contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs. In 2016, he made his debut for South Sydney from which he scored two tries in his last three games. Oldfield also spent time playing for Souths feeder club side the North Sydney Bears in the Intrust Super Premiership NSW making 5 appearances and scoring 5 tries.http://www.ssralmanac.com/mobile/pastplayers_bears.htmhttp://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=7-6942-0-0-0&sID;=141486&&news;_task=DETAIL&articleID;=43449892 Penrith Panthers Oldfield then signed to the Penrith Panthers signing a one -year deal. In the same year he was granted a release to join the Canberra Raiders on a two-year deal. Canberra Raiders Oldfield made 8 appearances for Canberra in the 2018 NRL season and scored 6 tries including a hat-trick against North Queensland. Oldfield made 9 appearances for Canberra in the 2019 NRL season and scored 5 tries.

The first pillararene was the five membered dimethoxypillar[5]arene.Cao, D.; Kou, Y.; Liang, J.; Chen, Z.; Wang, L.; Meier, H.; A Facile and Efficient Preparation of Pillararenes and a Pillarquinone. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 9721-9723. Chemical structure of pillar[5]arene History 1,4-Dimethoxypillar[5]arene, the first pillararene, was reported in 2008 by Tomoki Ogoshi et al. They catalyzed the condensation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and paraformaldehyde using a Lewis acid to obtain 1,4-dimethoxypillar[5]arene (DMpillar[5]arene). The methoxy groups of DMpillar[5]arene were then deprotected using boron tribromide and removed to give pillar[5]arene. Ogoshi and Kanai decided naming the new family of host macrocycles \\"pillararene\\", since they are cylindrical or pillar-like in shape and composed of aromatic or \\"arene\\" moieties.1 Chemists often refer to them as \\"pillarenes\\"Tan, L.-L.; Zhang, Y.; Li, B.; Wang, K.; Zhang, S.

Ed. 2018, 57, 2144-2149. Structure Pillararenes are composed of hydroquinone units linked by methylene bridges at para-positions. It features a symmetrical pillar architecture with two identical cavity gates. Pillar[5]arene is the most conformationally stable member in this family. Due to the close proximity of many electron-rich hydroquinones, the cavity of pillararenes are able to form strong association complexes with electron-poor species. Also, derivatives of the pillararenes can be generated by modifying the hydroxyl groups at all positions or selectively on one or two positions.Strutt, N. L.; Forgan, R. S.; Spruell, J. M.; Botros, Y. Y.; Stoddart, J. F. Monofunctionalized Pillar[5]arene as a Host for Alkanediamines. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 5668-5671. Planar chirality Enantiomers of Pillar[5]arene The orientation of the hydroquinone oxygens on both rims of the pillararene allow the macrocycle to exhibit planar chirality. When the substituent on the hydroquinone oxygen is small enough to fit through the cavity of the pillararene, allowing for oxygen-through-the- annulus rotation to occur, racemization occurs. If this substituent is large enough to prevent rotation, optically active pillararene macrocycles can be isolated.Ogoshi, T.; Masaki, K.; Shiga, R.; Kitajima, K.; Yamagishi, T.-a. Org. Lett. 2011, 13, 1264Strutt, N. L., Fairen-Jimenez, D.; Iehl, J.; Lalonde, M. B.; Snurr, R. Q.; Farha, O. K.; Hupp, J. T.; Stoddart, J. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 17436. Assignment of the absolute stereochemical designation of one hydroquinone unit of planar chiral DMpillar[5]arene. The pilot atom is shown in purple, and the three atoms used to assign the absolute stereochemistry are labeled and shown as spheres. A pillar[n]arene macrocycle, with n hydroquinone units, has n planes of chirality. DMpillar[5]arene has five planes of chirality which are \\"in sync\\" in the lowest energy conformational isomer due to unfavorable steric interactions between the methoxy groups of neighboring 1,4-dimethoxy-phenylene units. The absolute stereochemical designation of these planes of chirality in pillararene structures can be assigned following modified Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. The pilot atom for one of the five planes of chirality in pillar[5]arene is assigned to the highest priority atom that is not in the chiral plane - the first carbon atom of the neighboring phenylene unit. The three adjacent in-plane atoms are then assigned, starting with the methylene carbon attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and the directly connected phenylene carbon as 2, and the carbon atom connected to the methoxy group as 3. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R(p), otherwise it is assigned as S(p).Strutt, N.

Syntheses of Copillar[5]arenes by Co-oligomerization of Different Monomers, Organic Letters, 2010, 12, 3285-3287. introduced three new ways to synthesize copillararenes, which are composed of different repeating units. It is easier to selectively functionalize copillararenes, helping to generate interesting physical properties, conformations, and host‚Äìguest binding interactions. There are two possible ways to make copillararenes: to selectively modify repeating monomers of homopillararenes, or to use two different monomers to carry out co-oligomerization.  Mechanism  Pillararenes are traditionally formed through a thermodynamically controlled Friedel-Crafts cyclooligomerization.Holler, M.; Allenbach, N.; Sonet, J.; Nierengarten, J.-F. The high yielding synthesis of pillar[5]arenes under Friedel-Crafts conditions explained by dynamic covalent bond formation. Chem. Commun. 2012, 48, 2576. A practical and effective trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH)-catalyzed cyclooligomerization strategy was also developed for the synthesis of functionalized pillar[n]arenes and copillar[5]arenes from 1,4-dialkoxybenzenes with paraformaldehyde under mild reaction conditions, and the reaction mechanism of solution-phase catalytic synthesis of pillararenes was investigated by room-temperature X-band ESR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, NMR and control experiments, suggesting a free radical process initially and a Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation process during the consequent coupling and ring- closure stage.Wang, K.; Tan, L.-L.; Chen, D.-X.; Song, N.; Xi, G.; Zhang, S.

Selective Synthesis of Pillar[6]arene  Pillar[6]arene can be targeted as the major product of the Friedel-Crafts cyclooligomerization by using bulky alkoxy groups on the monomer, switching the Lewis acid catalyst Synthesis and host‚Äìguest properties of pillar[6]arenes. Sci. China Chem. 2012, 55, 223-228. or by using a bulky chlorinated solvent. Ogoshi and coworkers reported The template effect of solvents on high yield synthesis, co-cyclization of pillar[6]arenes and interconversion between pillar[5]- and pillar[6]arenes. Chem. Commun. 2014, 50, 5774-5777. the synthesis of a pillar[6]arene with 1,4-Bis(methylcyclohexyl ether)phenylene units in an 87% yield by using chlorocyclohexane as the solvent. The bulky chlorinated solvent was suggested to act as a template for the formation of the larger pillar[n]arene.  Higher Pillar[n]arenes  The higher pillar[n]arene homologues, pillar[6-15]arene, have been synthesized through the ring expansion of pillar[5]arene.Tomoki Ogoshi, Naosuke Ueshima, Fumiyasu Sakakibara, Tada-aki Yamagishi, and Takeharu Haino.

Biomedical applications  A molecular model of carboxylated- pillar[7]arene with the anti-Alzheimer drug memantine, showing the total encapsulation of the drug within the macrocycle's cavity. The host‚Äìguest complex is stabilized by hydrophobic effects within the cavity, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. While native pillar[n]arenes display no solubility in water, and are therefore unsuitable for biomedical applications, a range of water-soluble pillar[n]arenes have been reported. In particular, water-soluble carboxylated-pillar[n]arenes (where n = 6 or 7) have already shown potential in both drug delivery and bio-diagnostics because they are highly soluble, form host‚Äìguest complexes with a range of drug and medicine-based compounds, and appear to be relatively non-toxic. The cavity of carboxylated-pillar[5]arene is too small to include most drug molecules and therefore is not useful in drug delivery. To form a host‚Äìguest complex with the pillar[n]arenes, the drug must have a cationic charge; its ability to hydrogen-bond with the pillar[n]arenes is less important. Two planar dye molecules, like proflavine, can be simultaneously encapsulated within the cavity of a single caboxylated-pillar[7]arene. Because encapsulation within the cavity of carboxylated-pillar[6]arene quenches the fluorescence of proflavine, this gives rise to \\"on\\" and \\"off' states to the dye which may have application in bio-diagnostics.  Other potential applications  Pillar[n]arenes have been shown to have potential applications in molecular machinery,Hou, X.; Ke, C.; Cheng, C.; Song, N.; Blackburn, A. K.; Sarjeant, A. A.; Botros, Y.

Other versions  The song was re-recorded and re-released as two new versions‚Äîa version with a few vocal and guitar changes, and a limited edition Hot Topic acoustic version‚Äîalongside the songs \\"We Stitch These Wounds\\" and \\"The Mortician's Daughter\\" on their debut studio album, We Stitch These Wounds. The limited-copy acoustic version was re- released by StandBy Records to the general public for download on March 19, 2013.  Song information and background = Meaning behind \\"Knives and Pens\\"  The lyrics were written by Black Veil Brides vocalist Andy around the title \\"Knives and Pens\\" which, according to him describes a choice: Knives ‚Äî destruction (as in harming yourself), and Pens ‚Äî creation (as in the choice he decided to make to begin writing music and make something of their life). Black Veil Brides is saying in this song that if you make good choices in life, you can rise above and conquer whatever troubles you may come across.  Intro clip  The clip at the beginning of the original version of the song is from the documentary Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. It was taken from a recording of one of the West Memphis Three trials. The transcription of the clip is as follows:  Music information  The song is in the key of D minor and the guitars are tuned to Drop D. The song slowly builds around a piano's sustained D note, until the introductory clip ends, and then the band begins to play.  Music video  The official music video for the song was released on YouTube on June 17, 2009, directed by Patrick Fogarty, who later directed the \\"Perfect Weapon,\\" \\"The Legacy,\\" \\"Rebel Love Song,\\" and \\"Coffin\\" music videos. The video stars actor David Sasik, who is playing the role of the kid resembling Andy. It was a very low-budget project, but despite this, the video launched the band into international fame. The official video has reached over 111 million views on YouTube.  Video plot  The music video depicts a scenario similar to Andy's years in school, where he was bullied for the way he dressed, looked and the music he listened to. A boy walks to his school locker and sees papers taped to it that have hurtful messages written on them, such as \\"emo\\", \\"fag\\", and \\"kill yourself\\". He rips them down and throws them to the ground in anger. Even his brother bullies him, stealing his notebook that he writes lyrics inspired by his feelings of anger in. He goes home angry, but his brother eventually comes in and returns his notebook. He then proceeds to begin writing the lyrics to \\"Knives and Pens\\". He also is seen watching the video of Black Veil Brides playing the song and there are clips of the band playing with occasionally dressing in white and occasionally dressing in black.

The genomic DNA is 65,976 base pairs long, while the longest mRNA that it produces is 4463 bases long. It can be transcribed into 15 transcript variants, which in turn can produce 13 different isoforms of the protein.center  Gene Neighborhood  KIAA0895 is surrounded by the following genes on chromosome 7: *EEPD1 *MARK2P7 *ANLN *LOC111365168 *AOAH  Size of gene  The gene encoded for the KIAA0895 protein is 65,975 nucleotides long, from nucleotides 36324150 to 36390125, with seven exons.  mRNA  There are ten different isoforms for KIAA0895. *NP_001093895.1 *EAW94064.1 *NP_056129.2 *NP_001186636.1 *NP_001186635.1 *XP_005249746.1 *EAW94065.1 *XP_024302470.1 *NP_001186637.1 *NP_001287885.1 Protein The longest protein isoform that is produced by the KIAA0895 gene is termed LOC23366 isoform 1 and is 520 amino acids long. The predicted molecular weight is 61kDa. Additionally, the theoretical isoelectric point is 10.  Amino acid composition  KIAA0895 is a lysine and arginine semi- enriched protein. KIAA0895 is semi-enriched in positively charged lysine and arginine groups, and positively and negatively charged lysine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid groups. However, KIAA0895 is semi-depleted in non-polar alanine, glycine and proline groups. The charge distribution analysis shows that there are no negative or mixed charge clusters. However, there is one positive charge cluster from amino acids 12 to 36. Regions LOC23366 contains a protein domain of unknown function called DUF1704. It also contains a region of low complexity from position 120 to position 150 in the protein, and an arginine-rich area from position 12 to position 51.  Promoters  Using ElDorado by Genomatrix, a promoter region sequence was found. The most likely promoter for KIAA0895 starts at 36389926 and goes to 36391149, with a length of 1224.The predicted alt= Post-translational modification KIAA0895 is predicted to undergo phosphorylation at several serines, threonines, and tyrosines throughout its structure. Phosphorylation at these sites is a form of gene regulation. Phosphorylation results in a conformational change in the structure of many enzymes and receptors. This causes them to become activated or deactivated.  Stem loops  Using a database called Mfold, a stem-loop formation for the 5' UTR region shows that there is a lack of conservation, meaning there is some precedence that these stems and loops are not used for translation regulation. The ŒîG value was -12.90 kcal/mol with three loops. Using the same database, a stem-loop formation for the 3' UTR region shows that there is conservation, meaning there is some precedence that they are used for translation regulation. The ŒîG value was -636.80 kcal/mol.  Tertiary structure  KIAA0895 has a tertiary structure with alpha helices and beta sheets. Proposed Tertiary Structure for KIAA0895. none  Interacting proteins  There are three proteins likely to be interacting proteins with KIAA0895. These proteins are ELAVL1, vata, and glym.

Early life Loko is of Fijian and Tongan descent. Loko was raised in Claymore, New South Wales, a small suburb in Campbelltown. Rugby league career Loko began playing junior rugby league for Campbelltown City Kangaroos and Eagle Vale, while also attending Eaglevale High School. Loko then moved to Westfields Sports High School playing junior league with the Cabramatta Two Blues and Allsaints Toongabbie, before completing his senior year at The Hills Sports High School. He was part of the team that won the ARL Schoolboy Cup and also played for the New South Wales under 18's team at the state championships. 2010‚Äì14: Parramatta During Loko's senior year in high school, Loko performed strongly on the Parramatta Eels S. G. Ball Cup squad, which earned him a place in the National Youth Competition team. Loko played 16 games for the Parramatta Eels' National Youth Competition team over the 2010 and 2011 seasons, in which he has scored 7 tries including a hat- trick against the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Loko made his debut for the Parramatta Eels in round five of the 2011 NRL season, playing against the Melbourne Storm in a 38‚Äì0 defeat. He suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the Round 17 game against the Brisbane Broncos. He was ruled out of the remainder of the 2011 NRL season. In the 2012 preseason, Loko sustained another knee injury whilst boxing. He was once again ruled out for the season. Loko returned to first grade in the 2013 NRL season and made his return in round 1 against the New Zealand Warriors, where Parramatta won 40‚Äì10. Loko made a total of 13 appearances for Parramatta in the 2013 NRL season as the club finished last on the table and claimed the wooden spoon. 2014‚Äì2015: Canterbury-Bankstown Canterbury-Bankstown signed Loko in 2014.

Gene The LRRN3 is located on human chromosome 7, at 7q31.1. It contains 6 distinct gt-ag introns, and transcription produces five different mRNAs that appear to differ by truncation of the 3' end. There are only three main transcript variants that actually encode for the LRRN3 protein, with the longest transcript variant being 3744 base pairs in length. All three of these transcript variants have differing lengths and number of exons, but they all have the exon that includes the entire coding sequence for the LRRN3 protein. There are also two paralogs to the LRRN3 gene. These include the LRRN1 and LRRN2 genes, both of which have the same leucine-rich repeats that are characteristic to this family of genes. Protein The LRRN3 protein is 708 amino acids in length. The molecular weight of this protein is 79,424 Daltons, with an isoelectric point of 8.02. It is known to be a single-pass type I membrane protein because it spans the membrane once, with its N-terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane, and its signal sequence is removed. The LRRN3 protein contains 12 leucine-rich repeats, along with an LRRNT and an LRR_RI domain. Leucine-rich repeats are unusually rich in the hydrophobic amino acid leucine. They are common in protein-protein interaction motifs and are typically 20-29 amino acids in length. All major classes of LRRs are known to have a curved horseshoe structure with a parallel beta sheet on the concave side and mostly helical elements on the convex side. The LRRN3 protein also has an immunoglobulin domain, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane region toward the end of the protein. The composition of this protein is shown below. center Gene Conservation The multiple sequence alignment shows the highly conserved regions of the LRRN3 protein.The LRRN3 gene has been shown to be extremely highly conserved. There are 21 orthologs and homologs for this gene going back to zebra fish. This gene has not been found in any invertebrates or plant species. A multiple sequence alignment has shown this very high conservation of the LRRN3 gene among many different species. All 12 of the leucine-rich repeats, along with the LRRNT and the LRR_RI regions, are highly conserved in all vertebrates for which orthologs of this protein have been obtained. The Ig and FN3 domains also show high conservation in all of the orthologous sequences for mammals and birds, but are not as highly conserved for the rest of the homologous sequences. The high conservation of the leucine-rich repeats, the Ig domain, and the FN3 domain show that these regions must be of importance to the functionality of the LRRN3 gene. Gene Expression EST Profile data shows the gene expression of the LRRN3 gene.Gene Expression data has shown that the LRRN3 gene is expressed at very high levels in humans, about 2.3 times the average gene. It is most highly expressed in brain, heart, and testes tissues. It is also slightly expressed in kidney, muscle, pharynx, placental, and thymus tissue. The highest expression of the LRRN3 gene for the developmental stages is the fetal stage, but it is also expressed in the infant, juvenile, and adult stages, as can be seen in the EST profile. The expression data for the LRRN3 gene shows that it has its highest expression in the brain. Overall, the LRRN3 gene seems to have high to moderate expression throughout the majority of brain tissue. The highest expression being found in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, the cerebellar cortex, and the paraflocculus. All of these regions play a role in some key cognitive function, involving the processing of language and sensory stimuli, memory, and oculomotor behavior. The high expression of the LRRN3 gene in these regions of the brain could show that the LRRN3 gene has some importance in these cognitive function. Gene representation of the LRRN3 gene in the brain. Structure thumb The characteristic shape of leucine-rich repeat proteins is an arc or horseshoe shape. This horseshoe shape of the protein is created by a parallel beta sheet on the concave side and mostly helical elements on the convex side. Eleven residue segments of the LRRs, corresponding to the beta-strand and adjacent loop regions are conserved in LRR proteins, whereas the remaining parts of the repeats may be different. The concave face and the adjacent loops are the most common protein interaction surfaces on LRR proteins. 3D structures of some LRR protein-ligand complexes show that the concave surfact of the LRR domain is ideal for interaction with alpha-helix, thus supporting the conclusions that the elongated and curved LRR structure provides a framework for achieving diverse protein-protein interactions. Comparison of the LRRN3 protein with the chain A of the crystal structure of the LINGO1 ectodomain shows that the LRRN3 protein takes on the characteristic horseshoe shape of most leucine-rich repeat proteins. The LINGO1 ectodomain also has a very long stretch of leucine-rich repeats which is the region that has the best alignment with the LRRN3 protein. This similar region shows that the LRRN3 protein has a structure that includes mostly beta-strands that are connected by loops, with a few alpha helices throughout.

Background The lyrics were composed by the group and reviewed by Valve, the company who made the game, to ensure they fit with the tone of one of the Rattmann's dens, where it appears in-game. The National had expressed to Bug Music, their publishing label, an interest in doing music for Valve which the label forwarded on to Valve in discussing other music opportunities for the game. Valve and Bug Music identified that the National would fit well into Portal 2, as their \\"raw and emotive music evokes the same visceral reactions from its listeners that Portal does from its players\\" according to Bug Music's spokesperson Julia Betley. The track was originally to be used in one of several hidden \\"fake endings\\" of the game, but was later forced to be rewritten to be more sombre and got put in the game as an Easter egg. Critical reception Paste described the song as a \\"haunted, piano-lead ballad\\" similar to the band's song \\"Think You Can Wait\\" used in the film Win Win. Exclaim! described the song as a \\"sombre ballad that places Matt Berninger's melancholic croon atop gloomy piano chords, lush orchestral swells and some subtle percussion\\". \\"Exile Vilify\\" (alongside other Portal 2 song \\"Want You Gone\\") was nominated for \\"Best Song in a Game\\" at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards.

around the world on a daily basis to conduct research in macro and international economics and compute real-time inflation metrics. It was started in 2008 by professors Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon. In 2007, the BPP initiated Inflaci√≥n Verdadera, a project that provided a daily inflation gauge for Argentina, serving as an alternative to the official CPI which was manipulated by the government during 2007-2016. Within the same framework, in May 2017 the BPP began experimenting with crowd-sourcing and mobile technologies to measure the monthly inflation rate in Venezuela where official statistics haven‚Äôt been published since 2015. Recent research projects include, for example, the study of how offline pricing behavior is being affected by the web, mobile browsing and price-checking technologies. Other recent research makes use of online prices to construct quarterly purchasing power parities that could provide real-time estimates of real consumption across countries without the need for consumer price index extrapolations across both developing and developed countries. The BPP monitored daily price fluctuations of ~15 million items sold by +1000 online retailers in more than 70 countries.

A Republican, she was the first member of her party in 80 years to serve in the position. On October 22, 2015, she resigned her position amid a corruption and campaign law investigation. She subsequently pleaded guilty to six of 65 fraud and embezzlement charges against her as part of an agreement reached with the Attorney General of New Mexico. Duran was sentenced to 30 days in jail and began her sentence on December 18, 2015. She was previously a New Mexico State Senator from District 40, first elected in 1992. Family Duran began her political career as a deputy county clerk in Otero County, New Mexico and served from 1988 to 1992 as Otero Country Clerk. In 1993 she became a member of the New Mexico Senate and remained there until 2010 when she won election as Secretary of State Duran, a New Mexico native and resident of Tularosa, New Mexico, is married to Leo Barraza; they have five children.http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2010&off;=7&elect;=0&fips;=35&f;=0 Education Duran was born in Tularosa, New Mexico, and attended public schools there, graduating from Tularosa High School in 1973. She attended New Mexico State University. Career Duran attended New Mexico State University in Alamogordo before beginning work in the Office of the Otero County Clerk in 1979. Elected county clerk in 1988, she served two consecutive two-year terms. In 1992, she was elected to the New Mexico Senate, serving until 2010, when she resigned after being elected Secretary of State on November 2. While in the Senate Duran pushed for legislation requiring citizens to produce photo ID before they could vote. On January 1, 2011, Duran became New Mexico's 24th Secretary of State. She was the first Republican elected to that office since 1928. She promised initiatives to modernize and streamline operations and cut costs. She said her primary objective was the integrity of the electoral system and that she believed that in a republic, legitimacy rested on the people's belief that elections are conducted fairly, votes are counted correctly, and that only eligible voters are allowed to participate. On July 31, 2011 Duran cited a \\"culture of corruption\\" when she turned the names of 64,000 voters over to the state police, saying they did not match the Social Security and motor vehicle data bases. She also said that 117 foreign nationals had registered to vote and 37 had actually done so. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a public information request for the records in question, saying that they wanted to verify the statement. But Duran refused, citing executive privilege. Eventually the figures were amended: actually, two foreign nationals had registered to vote, and of the two only one had actually voted, apparently accidentally. In 2014 Duran won reelection, outspending challenger Bernalillo County Clerk Maggie Toulouse Oliver $195,635 to $145,690 on television ads alone. In 2015 she testified in favor of HB340 before the Legislature's Judiciary Committee. The bill, which would have mandated a requirement for voter ID, did pass out of committee on a party-line vote, but died on the floor of the Legislature. In addition to bringing New Mexico into compliance with federal mandates regarding removal of ineligible voters from the rolls, as the chief elections officer of the state, Secretary Duran ended the established practice of single party voting (straight-ticket voting). Fraud and embezzlement charges On August 27, 2015, New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas charged Duran with 64 violations in a criminal complaint, including fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, campaign law violations, tampering with public records, conspiracy, and violating the Governmental Conduct Act. The complaint alleged that Duran illegally used campaign funds for personal use. Duran's lawyer responded: \\"we have identified some serious potential violations of law by the New Mexico Attorney General's Office, in conducting the investigation.\\" On October 2, 2015 Duran was also charged with identity theft, her 65th charge, for listing former state Sen. Don Kidd as her 2010 campaign treasurer even though he publicly said he had no knowledge of this and played no such role. On October 23, 2015 Duran entered an into a plea deal, entering a guilty plea to six of the 65 charges against her. Under the terms of the plea agreement Duran will keep her pension from the State of New Mexico Public Employees Retirement System. Resignation and guilty plea Duran resigned from office late October 25, and formally entered her guilty plea October 26. Sentencing was at the court's discretion, but as part of the agreement, she was barred from future handling of, and responsibility for, public money. Two of the charges are felonies, and felons cannot hold public office in New Mexico. The most serious charge is that while in office and responsible for enforcing campaign finance law, Duran misreported and under-reported campaign contributions from Mack Energy Exploration, an oil energy exploration company based in Artesia, New Mexico. The agreement leaves open the potential for counseling; at least some of the embezzlement charges stemmed from her use of campaign accounts at Sandia Casino.  Sentencing  On December 15, 2015, Duran was sentenced to 30 days in jail and was ordered to pay $28,000 in fines and restitution. As part of her plea deal, the judge also ordered Duran to complete 2,000 hours of community service, write letters of apology to New Mexicans and campaign donors, and make 144 speeches to school groups and civic groups about her crimes. She was also ordered to continue to attend gambling addiction therapy and forbidden to enter a casino or race track for five years. She began her 30-day sentence on December 18, 2015. Electoral history Duran defeated incumbent Mary Herrera of the Democratic Party on November 2, 2010, becoming the first Republican elected to the position since 1928.

Its mouth is a Lake Michigan harbor and marina adjacent to Michigan City, Indiana's lakefront Washington Park. History In the 1780 Battle of Trail Creek 16 Americans and Frenchmen led by Capt. Hamelin and Lt. John Brady were badly defeated by the British and their Potawotami allies. Trail Creek was called Myewes-zibiwe in Potawatomi, meaning \\"trail-creek\\", which referred to the \\"Potawotami Trail\\" that ran from Chicago along the south shore of Lake Michigan, along Trail Creek, then to Hudson Lake and finally to the French Fort St. Joseph and the nearby Jesuit mission (now Niles, Michigan) on the St. Joseph River. The French named it La Rivi√®re du Chemin (River of the Trail), and in 1815 and 1818 it was referred to as the Road River and Chemin River. In 1816 a shoreline survey indicated that Trail Creek was wide. At its mouth and on the harbor's western bank stood \\"Hoosier Slide\\", a sand dune (today's Mount Baldy in Indiana Dunes National Park is only tall). The summit of the majestic dune was mantled with trees, and picnics and weddings were held there where Chicago tourists enjoyed a beautiful view of the lake and the vast lumberyards of Washington Park. Hoosier Slide was removed by sand mining from 1890 to 1920, the sand being used for glassmaking and also for landfill in Chicago's Jackson Park and for the Illinois Central Railroad right-of-way. The former site of Hoosier Slide was acquired by Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) to construct a coal-generating power plant in the late 1920s. In 1832, Isaac Elston bought of land including Trail Creek and the harbor, intending to build a road to homesteaders in central Indiana so that they could export farm crops to Lake Michigan. Michigan City arose from Elston's ambition. Early visitors to the region were captivated by its rugged beauty, its abundance of wildflowers and berries, and especially the majestic Hoosier Slide and other sand dunes. Incorporated in 1836, Michigan City's early prosperity was due to the flowing waters of Trail Creek which afforded good locations for lumber and gristmills. In the 1800s 13 grist mills were located on the banks of Trail Creek. Watershed and course Sampling locations for Trail Creek Watershed Partnership Water Quality Monitoring Program Students paddle on Trail Creek as part of Trail Creek Week The Trail Creek Watershed, located in northwestern Indiana‚Äôs LaPorte County, drains a 59.1 square mile area of mixed land uses into Lake Michigan at Michigan City, IN. The watershed comprises three sub- watersheds: The Main Branch, the East Branch and the West Branch. The Main Branch sub-watershed has the greatest amount of developed land, including commercial, industrial and residential lands. The East Branch and West Branch sub-watersheds are primarily rural in character, including a mix of row crop agriculture, livestock, hayfield, low-density development and natural areas. Historically and to the present, Trail Creek has acted as a natural firebreak. Habitat and wildlife Pinhook Bog in the Trail Creek Watershed was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1965 and is part of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Pinhook Bog is the only true bog in located within Indiana. A bog is a specific type of wetland that accumulates acidic peat from dead plant material. This bog was formed by glacial meltwater on a clay bed. Pinhook Bog consists of about , of which approximately are a floating peat mat, with approximately of wetland separating the bog from the adjacent uplands. Federally threatened, endangered, or candidate species noted in LaPorte County include the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), and Mitchell‚Äôs satyr butterfly (Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii). Trail Creek is one of very few Indiana streams with coldwater habitat capable of supporting salmonid (trout and salmon) spawning. Conservation An immediate product of early efforts included the preparation and completion of the ‚ÄúTrail Creek Watershed Management Plan of 1993‚Äù. This report offered a multi-faceted and substantive plan focused on nonpoint sources of pollution, with recommendations to reduce sedimentation and nutrient loading to the stream of Trail Creek. Several demonstration projects including 4 streambank restoration projects and a constructed wetland for residential sewage disposal were implemented with grant monies as a result of the 1993 Trail Creek Watershed Management Plan; however long term monitoring was not implemented nor were additional grant monies sought for implementation. The Watershed Management plan stated that a ‚ÄúLead Agency‚Äù needed to be identified to coordinate watershed improvement activities. In hindsight, a fatal shortcoming of the implementation of the 1993 Watershed management plan was that no ‚ÄúLead Agency‚Äù was ever identified. FOUR goals and a variety of objectives were identified within the 1993 Trail Creek Watershed Management Plan. Many of those goals and objectives remain valid with the current (2007) plan update. The goals from the 1993 Watershed Management Plan are as follows: 1\\\\. Reduce potential health hazards due to poor water quality in the stream of Trail Creek. 2\\\\. Improve aquatic life support. Increase quality/quantity of recreational opportunities to stimulate economic growth. 3\\\\. Develop a public awareness of the unique and diverse opportunities the stream of Trail Creek Provides. IN DECEMBER of 2003, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) issued a detailed technical report regarding excessive E. coli levels in Trail Creek entitled ‚ÄúTrail Creek Escherichia Coli TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) Report.‚Äù This report indicates that for point sources of E. coli pollution, such as wastewater treatment plants, the ‚ÄúNPDES permitting and monitoring requirements will provide the necessary reasonable assurance that these sources are not contributing to violations of state E. coli standards.‚Äù For non-point sources of E. coli pollution, the report concludes that: ‚Äúnon-point sources will need to be monitored locally for implementation of BMPs (best management practices) or in providing access to watershed grants to assist in reducing non-point sources to meet the load allocations (LA) developed under this TMDL.‚Äù The preparation of this watershed management plan update is the next logical step in achieving cleaner water in northwestern LaPorte County as envisioned by IDEM in 2003.(Trail Creek Watershed Management Plan, 2007) The Michigan City Sanitary District took on the challenge of leading the development of the Trail Creek Watershed Management Plan, approved by IDEM in April 2007, and has remained a leader in the management of the Trail Creek Watershed ever since. Michigan City Sanitary District has been monitoring the Creek since 2005. This data was used to develop the water quality goals of the 2007 Trail Creek Watershed Management Plan: 1\\\\. Meet the State Water Quality Standard for E. coli of a monthly geometric mean of 125 cfu/100 ml and a maximum daily standard of 235 cfu/100 ml; 2\\\\. Decrease sedimentation and dredging of the navigable channel. Total Suspended Solid goal of 15 mg/l; 3\\\\. Decrease nutrient loading in Trail Creek to the target concentrations (0.05 mg/l ortho-phosphorus, 0.05 mg/l total phosphorus, 0.25 to 0.1 mg/l nitrogen ammonia, 1.0 mg/l TKN, and 10 mg/l nitrate-nitrite); 4\\\\. Maintain a natural stream channel and flow In 2011, the Trail Creek Watershed Steering Committee decided to begin the implementation of the WMP. A Section 319 grant was secured and the project began in 2012. The goals of the project were to: 1\\\\. Implement the Trail Creek watershed management plan by developing and implementing a cost-share program for BMPs in critical urban and agricultural areas identified in the plan 2\\\\. Contract with an individual to serve as an implementation coordinator to develop and administer the cost- share program 3\\\\. Achieve improved water quality through urban and agricultural BMPs The Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) 2010 fish consumption advisory listed brown trout, carp, rock bass, smallmouth bass and walleye as group 3 or 4 (limit consumption to one meal every 1 to 2 months), with all other fish species limited to one meal per week unless a child or pregnant woman. The Nature Conservancy protected the \\"Trail Creek Fen\\", a parcel of raised graminoid fen and the sedge-covered wetland, that was donated to Save the Dunes Conservation Fund in 2005. Recreation Boating and fishing are the most prominent uses of the Trail Creek harbor and marina. From the outlet at the marina to the E Street Bridge, the entire navigable channel is lined with residential and commercial structures, marinas and docks, and the Blue Chip casino. Creek Ridge Park located five miles east of US 421 on County Road 400 in Michigan City is also a LaPorte County park. The Northwest Indiana Paddling Association (NWIPA) has led the recreational and stewardship efforts on Trail Creek. As a member of the Trail Creek Watershed Partnership, NWIPA has hosted an annual Trail Creek Fun Float, an annual Ride the Wave Regatta and participated in the Annual \\"Trail Creek Week\\". Trail Creek Week is a five-day, hands-on immersive educational experience. Trail Creek is a designated trout and salmon stream, and supports one of the few remaining cold water fisheries in Indiana. In the early 1970s the Indiana Department of Natural Resources began stocking Trail Creek with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Skamania summer-run and winter-run steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). As of the end of 2010 Trail Creek had produced the Indiana state record Chinook salmon (caught by Rich Baker in 1980 and weighed 38 pounds) and the state record Steelhead Trout (caught by Evan Nicholson in 1999 and weighing 26.62 pounds). The creek also had the state record Brown trout (Salmo trutta) (caught in 1999 by Steven Bay and weighing 24.18 pounds) until 2006 when a larger one (26.06 pounds) was caught in Lake Michigan itself. Trail Creek also supports other native game and non- game fish species.

It thus rises almost over the surrounding area. The Rauenstein is almost completely wooded, but has several dominant sandstone rock faces. The sandstone here is very soft and heavily weathered.  Location and area  On the eastern side is the village of Wei√üig in the borough of Struppen. On the north and east side there are various climbing towers, the best known being the Nonne or Nonnenstein, that is situated 200 metres from the eastern side of the Rauenstein. The rock was the site of a medieval watchtower (Burgwarte). At the southeastern end of the Rauenstein is a hill restaurant that has been there since 1893. Before that, from 1886 to 1893, drinks were sold in the Kapp Cave (Kapph√∂hle), also the Kappmeyer or Kamm Cave, on the summit plateau. One year earlier the touristic development of the Rauenstein had been started by the Dresden Branch of the Mountain Club.

Alaska Native storytelling has been passed down through generations by means of oral presentation. The stories tell life lessons or serve as lessons in heritage. Many different aspects of Arctic life are incorporated into each story, mainly the various animals found in Alaska. Due to the decline in the number of speakers of native languages in Alaska and a change in lifestyle amongst many of the native peoples, oral storytelling has become less common. In recent years many of these stories have been written down, though many people argue that the telling of the story is just as important as the words within. History The beginning of the decline of native speakers of Alaska Native languages can be traced back to the colonization of Alaska by the United States of America. At this time, many native people were separated from their traditional lifestyles and subsequently their native languages. Due to a new-found language barrier, new generations of Alaska Natives could not communicate with their elders and therefore could not inherit all of the traditional stories.The Land is Ours, 1996 New technology has also reinvigorated the art through various webcasts and other online mediums; however the amount of native speakers is still declining. Despite the rapid decline in spoken Alaska Native languages, the tradition of storytelling in Alaska remains alive. Storytellers Storytellers pass down myths, legends, and traditions within their tribes. They use inflection in their voices, hand gestures and movement to tell the stories. When performing, tellers wear traditional clothing and other garments. They also bring objects such as carvings, rugs, and pottery to represent the teller's tribe.Myths Encyclopedia Myths and Legends of the World, Tellers do not censor the stories; the children hear exactly the same stories older generations have listened to.Echo Education through Cultural & Historical Organizations, Short tales are often told by anyone who has memorized the story. It may also be told at any time. The stories are retold to the youth to promote proper behavior in their culture; storytellers learn the stories through repeated tellings. Tellers are allowed to change and add to a short story and sometimes seek suggestions from fellow storytellers on what they can correct or add to their tellings.Book Rags, 2004 Tribes are more strict with traditional tales, which are usually told by the Elders. Storytellers learn long, complicated stories by being apprenticed with Elders. The tellers are required to recite the stories accurately before delivering it to an audience. The stories do not have to be told the same way, but each retelling must include all the elements. Before telling a story, the storyteller begins with a formatted introduction. The introduction includes the storyteller‚Äôs English and Native names, hometown, family background, and how they learned the story. If the story does not belong to them, they must also honor the owner or credit the source. Part of storytelling is the interaction between the storyteller and the audience. The audience and their response to the story influence how the story is told. The teller reads the audience‚Äôs body language and determines how to continue with the story; depending on the response, tellers may choose to speed up, slow down, or finish a story. Storytellers also encourage audience participation to keep the listeners interested in the story. Storytellers do not tell the audience the moral or point of the story; it is up to them to figure it out on their own. During a telling, the audience generates mental images of what is happening and they create different versions of the story. In the end, each audience member leaves the performance with his or her own understanding of the story.Interview with Lance Twitchell, April 14, 2011 Nature Nature is a huge part of the lives of Alaska Natives and it has an influence on their story-telling. Alaska Natives tell stories where nature plays a main role. Nature is a great influence in the story-telling because native people have respect for it. The seasons play a large role in Alaska Native storytelling. When the events in a story involve the seasons, the relating elements are used. There are bodies of water, forests, mountains and tundra mentioned in a story when the events in a story are based on seasons other than winter. The spring, summer and fall play a smaller part in Native stories, but when these seasons are used, the story usually involves people hiking in the wild. When the events are based in a season other than the winter, aspects of an Alaskan summer, like longer days and sunshine, are involved.Indigenous People‚Äôs Literature The majority of stories are set in winter. Winter is usually described as cruel and harsh, with extremely cold temperatures, heavy snowfall, and biting winds. When the story is centered during winter, the story-tellers will use the forces in nature such as the snow, wind storms, blizzards, and the ice. A massive part of Alaska‚Äôs region is covered by glaciers and it influences the storytelling. Plants do not have as vital of a part in the storytelling as seasons have. Some plants and trees are described in the stories that are found in Alaska‚Äôs wilds: birch (regular and dwarf), spruce, wild roses, as well as different kinds of bushes. The ice pack and the mountains are often described in story-telling because a large part of Alaska‚Äôs country is covered with them, making them a large influence on the Alaska Native peoples. Animals Storytelling in Alaska Native culture is heavily influenced by animals that are a part of the tribes‚Äô everyday lives. Animals are given the star roles in the stories, both the actor and the main theme. The animals symbolize many things such as their beliefs or taboos of a tribe or clan. The stories are told about the marking of seasons, when the salmon come into the streams or when the moose lose their antlers. Animals in story-telling can provide a joyful and humorous experience for the tribe during the winter months. Animals can play the roles of tricksters in the stories. Common trickster figures in Native American mythology include the rabbit in the Eastern regions, the coyote and spider in the Plains and the Southwest regions, and the raven in the Pacific Northwest. Numerous animals appear in myths and legends and they rarely have purely animal characteristics. The animals are gifted with the power of speech and human attributes. The animals in the stories interact with people and frequently change between human and animal form. The stories and themes are constructed around one main animal, like for example the badger, loon, and or beaver. These animals are not as popular as the Raven or Crow. The raven and or crow are the most popular characters in native folklore. Amongst the many tribes in Alaska, the raven shares the same meanings, such as the trickster, always getting into trouble, events such as bringing light into the world . The raven symbolizes helping the people and shaping the world. These stories about helping and shaping the world are: \\"How Raven brought light to the World,\\" a Haida legend,First People-The Legends \\"Raven Steals the Sun,\\" an Eyak story,Native Languages of the Americas: Preserving and Promoting American Indian language, Johnny Stevens ‚ÄúRaven Steals the Light,‚Äù an Athabascan legend,Marshall Cultural Atlas \\"Raven and His Grandmother,\\" an Aleut story, \\"The origin of light,\\" an Eskimo legend,First People-The Legends \\"Raven\\" a Tlingit story,Native Languages of the Americas: Preserving and Promoting American Indian language, J.R. Swanton Collection \\"Raven becomes voracious,\\" a Tsimshain legend. These stories all have a main thread running through them about the raven, he is a trickster, but ends up helping the people. Life lessons Many different aspects are incorporated into the composition of a traditional Alaska Native story narrative. There are tales written with the specific purpose of passing history itself on from one generation to the next. In others, pieces of nature that are incorporated can take on a life of their own.\\"The Girl Who Married the Moon\\", 8 June 2004 Animals can be deified and worshipped or be cast in the part of a trickster such as the raven or coyote. As with any culture, there are stories told to explain a broad spectrum of life‚Äòs aspects, and others are created to express humor alone. Found within many of the stories that have been recorded, some still told today, are a set of valuable life lessons that are handed down through the relationship of the storyteller and the avid listener. Woven into a great adventure or a fantastic tale various ideals can be easily recognized within many Alaska Native stories. These ideals are painted directly into the heart of the story making it a great lesson for the avid listener. Such stories are told to teach the young, or to remind someone that has forgotten one of these important principles. Respecting nature, honoring family and tribe, having faith and trust, or getting along with their fellow men are several that are characteristic and thought important enough to pass on.\\"Tlingit Myths and Texts\\", July 2003 Guidance is another prevalent aspect found accompanying the ideals within many Alaska Native stories. This guidance offers warnings against apparent evils such as pride, envy, poor decision making, or committing sins. In one classic Tlingit tale retold by S.E. Schlosser and entitled ‚ÄúHow selfishness was rewarded‚Äù,\\"How Selfishness was Rewarded\\", 4 Apr 2011 a woman uses a magical combination of words to summon fish from the ocean late at night. She then cooks and consumes this fish while her family sleeps keeping all of the catch for herself. Eventually she is caught by her family and is punished for her selfish ways. She is magically transformed into an owl, not by her family but, by the magic she had come so accustomed to. The tale ends with, \\"To this day, the plaintive hoot of the owl may be heard in the wilds of Alaska, reminding those who hear it of the price a young girl once paid for her selfishness. \\" The different types of lessons on guidance along with the virtues that are shared and passed along through the tribe‚Äôs generations are an important element of the ancient and rich Alaska Native culture and they stories they create.

This model was developed by Jeanne R. Steele and Jane D. Brown in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of media consumption. This theoretical framework was developed to better understand what drives teenagers to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the dialectical aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents‚Äô individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele & Brown, 1995).Steele, J.R., & Brown, J.D. (1995). Adolescent room culture: Studying media in the context of everyday life. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24(5), 551. Retrieved November 30, 2010, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 12036417)  Origin  The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily journals, in-depth interviews, self-administered questionnaires and ‚Äúroom touring‚Äù to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents‚Äô ‚Äúroom culture.‚Äù This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents‚Äô bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus & Nurius, 1986).Markus, H., & Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. Am. Psychol. 41: 954-969 The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as Selective Exposure Theory, Uses and Gratifications, Framing, Cultivation theory, and Emotional Conditioning.  Components  The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, interaction and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one's identity and lived experience. Identity formation is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele & Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents‚Äô sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of cultural production and reproduction. The theoretical perspective of ‚Äúlived through experience‚Äù (Vygotsky, 1978),Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes. In M. Cole, V. John- Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (Eds.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. also takes into account the developmental stage, the sociocultural differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as religious beliefs, interactions within one's neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù emphasizes the idea that adolescents‚Äô interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of ‚Äúlived experience (Steele & Brown, 1995).‚Äù Selection, within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele & Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by motivations, which in turn affects attention to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as selective exposure and uses and gratifications theory. This means that a teenager's motivation to attend to certain media might be based on affective, behavioral, cognitive and instrumental needs, or it could also simply be a result of habituation (Steele & Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her ethnic heritage. Interaction is defined as the cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement with the media that produces cultural meanings, which are affected by adolescents‚Äô evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele & Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents‚Äô evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions. :Evaluation and interpretation of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of identity formation. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele & Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele & Brown, 1995). The concept of ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, racial understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media. Application is defined as the concrete ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele & Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation. :Appropriation is an active, intentional, easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. Incorporation, on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens unconsciously. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the self, building on already existing attitudes, feelings and knowledge (Steele & Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.  Development  Based on reviewers‚Äô critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as ‚Äúteens‚Äô practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).‚Äù This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as hard rock or heavy metal (Steele, 1999).Steele, J. (1999). Teenage Sexuality and Media Practice: Factoring in the Influences of Family, Friends, and School (Book). Journal of Sex Research, 36(4), 331-341. Retrieved from Communication & Mass Media Complete database Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele‚Äôs (1999) study also provided more depth to the ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one's race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on media content or media effects. Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.

Capture Veloz Pasajera, of 408 tons (bm), Jayme Tinto, owner, sailed from Havana on 25 August 1828 with a crew of 100 men. She acquired her slaves at Jacquin and sailed on 7 September 1830.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database ‚Äì Veloz Pasajera voyage #2423. Primrose encountered Veloz Passagera off Prince's Island, West Africa, in the evening of 6 September 1830. The British attacked early in the morning of 7 September. A severe single-ship action ensued in which the British ultimately boarded Veloz Passagera, capturing her. Forty-three slavers out of 150 were killed in action and another 20 were wounded; the British lost three killed and 12 wounded. The engagement was one of the few fought during several decades of anti-slavery operations off the African coast, and was the most significant in terms of casualties and the strength of the opposing forces. Veloz Passagera had 556 slaves aboard her when Primrose opened fire. Five died as a result of the broadsides from Primrose, and another 21 died before the court condemned Velos Passagera and emancipated the slaves.Grindal (2016), Kindle edition location 8741. Primrose sent Veloz Passagera to Sierra Leone for adjudication by the Anglo-Spanish Court of Mixed Commission. She arrived on 9 October, and the Court condemned her on 16. The British wanted to try 24 of surviving crew in England with piracy. Captain Broughton sailed Primrose back to England as well, leaving Africa in December to follow up on the court proceedings.Spears,pg. 143 He took with him the 24 crew men. However, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary, decided that British courts had no jurisdiction and that charges of piracy were not appropriate. He had the 24 men transported to Spain where they stood trial in 1831. The proceeds of the bounty granted for 551 slaves and a moiety of the hull, etc., were deposited in the Registry of the High Court of Admiralty on 16 June 1831.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Pontinha e Fam√µes. It is on the periphery of the metropolitan area of Lisbon, District of Lisbon, within the NUTS III Region of Lisboa e Vale do Tejo. History Although it is likely that Arabs settled in the vicinity around the 14th century, the first documented settlement dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries, when nobles and some clergy established estates in the area. In its history, the region was a small agglomeration of inhabitants, living along the Rio da Costa (whose spring flowed from the Casal do Castelo), and serviced by a small dock (Porto da Pai√£) that allowed the transport of goods to and from Lisbon (and permitted a nascent economy). The Quinta da Pontinha existed, at least, since 1657. This farm estate changed proprietors (and names) during several centuries: at the beginning of the 18th century, it was known as Quinta dos Brasileiros (owing to its wealthy owners originating from Brazil), and after various new occupants, in 1796, it was known as Quinta dos Valadares. It was only in the 19th century, that began to be known as Quinta da Pontinha. For many years, Pontinha was subdivided into properties and seigniorial holdings; some of these names remain important toponymic references in the community, such as Casal do Falc√£o (where the painter Vieira Lusitano lived), Quinta da Pai√£ (or Casal Novo), Casal de Azeit√£o, Quinta da Pentieira or Quinta do Enforcado. Lisboetas, during the 18th and 19th century, were visitors to the area of Pai√£, known for the \\"clear fresh air\\"; the wealthy and upwardly mobile citizens of Lisbon would attend theatres and festivals: Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal was a frequent visitor to the diplomatic home of the King of Prussia in Pontinha. Over the centuries, the scattered population centers have merged with growth. Pontinha was part of the much larger municipality of Bel√©m around 1852, passing briefly into the administration of Olivais around 1886, before being administered by Loures after 26 July 1886. It was defined by the construction of the Estrada Militar ou Fiscal, which facilitated the imposition of taxes on local commerce. By the beginning of the 20th century (March 1917), the Escola Profissional Agr√≠cola D. Dinis, situated in Pai√£, had, since its founding, administered the education of agricultural sciences. Its heritage included approximately used as pastureland and/or lands for cultivation. Similarly, the Centro Escolar Republicano Tenente Valdez (Republican Central School Lieutnenat Valdez) was established during this period in the Chapel of Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, which was completely abandoned by 1911 (even after extensive restoration was completed in 1908). By 1936, the first electric light arrived in the parish, and in 1947 the first public works that would bring canalized water and sanitation to the population of 2507 consumers (completed in 1949). By 1950, a demographic explosion resulted in the encroachment of residential dwellings that transformed Pontinha into a bedroom community of Lisbon. On 28 June 1971, the patriarch of Lisbon created the ecclesiastical parish of Pontinha, from a portion of the parish of Sant√≠ssimo Nome de Jesus de Odivelas, even as most of the religious connections within the civil parish were associated with the neighboring parish of S√£o Louren√ßo de Carnide. The religious parish is centered on the Chapel of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, today a church, a temple designed by J√∫lio Pomar. On 25 April 1974, the command post for the Movimento das For√ßas Armadas (MFA) was established in Pontinha. In the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution (1974), after Marcelo Caetano surrendered to General Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola, members of the Estado Novo government (including Caetano) were transported by armoured car to the military engineering barracks in Pontinho, where they remained overnight.Kenneth Maxwell (1995), p.59-60 The Pontinha barracks were also the location from which Major Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho directed the coup d'√©tat during the events of the revolution. The garrison was later transformed into a museum, established through a protocol between the 1st Engineering Regiment and the Comiss√£o Instaladora do Munic√≠pio de Odivelas. An administrative division of the municipality of Odivelas since 1984, under Law No. 44/84, approved on 30 November 1984 and published on 31 December 1984, it was de- annexed from the parish of Odivelas. Quickly, the parish was elevated to the status of vila or town under Law No. 75/91 (16 August 1991) and approved on 16 June 1991. Geography It is limited in the north by the Odivelan parishes of Fam√µes and Odivelas, to the west by Amadora Municipality (the parish of Alfornelos) and in the south by the municipality of Lisbon (parish of Carnide), in addition to Sintra Municipality. The territory that composes the parish, was once a grouping of estates, farms and agricultural fields: the Escola Profissional Agr√≠cola D. Dinis (D. Dinis Professional Agricultural School) is one of the few remnants of this era. After the 1950s, there were many demographic shifts in Lisbon that resulted in the area's increasing importance as a residential \\"neighborhood\\". These barrios, some of which had their basis in illegal squatting or tenements, have since developed into intricate parts of the community. The population is relatively youthful, with about 5% of which includes seniors or retirement age residents. The parish contains the localities Bairro Novo de Santo El√≥i, Pai√¢, Pontinha, Presa, Serra da Luz, Vale Grande and Vale Pequeno. Economy The economy of the parish is primarily associated with the tertiary sector industries; principally, these include commercial shops, restaurants, personal and domestic services. Equally important, is the civil construction sector and industrial services, such as rubber manufacturers, metallurgy, glues/resins, marble-workers, paints and frozen products. Architecture=Civic * Edif√≠cio Velho Mirante (Oldview Building) - located on Rua de Santo Eloy (in the centre of the parish), the building dates back to the 18th century, and is unusual for its trapezoidal entrance and wrought-iron gate. Although currently a restaurant, the building was owned by the 18th century nobility, a probably a carriage house. * N√∫cleo Museol√≥gico do Posto de Comando do MFA (Museum/Command Post of the Armed Forces Movement) - the historical command post for the MFA, responsible for toppling the dictatorship of the Estado Novo, and where Marcelo Caetano was briefly detained/arrested before being sent into exile in Madeira.

In general, solidarity of an obligation is never presumed, and it must be expressly stated as the true intent of the parties' will. Contractual solidary obligations are frequently created by insurance policies or co-signing a loan. A common example of a solidary obligation created thorough operation of law is vicarious liability such as respondeat superior. Solidarity can be either active or passive. A solidary obligation that is active exists among the obligees (creditors) in the transaction. It is passive when it exists among the obligors (debtors) in a transaction. A solidary obligation is almost always an advantage for a creditor because it will either allow any creditor to demand the entirety of the debt from the sole debtor when the solidarity is active, or it will allow the creditor to demand the entirety of the debt from any of the multiple debtors when it is passive. The origin of solidarity can be traced to a Roman idea known as correality where a single thing was owed by more than one person. Under these circumstances, there was just a single obligation. There was a transformation and growth of this idea during the ius commune before being codified in the Napoleonic Code of 1804. In Louisiana law, solidary obligations are governed by articles 1789‚Äì1806 of the Louisiana Civil Code. Solidary obligations for obligees This is known as active solidarity. An obligation is solidary for the obligees when it gives each obligee the right to demand the whole performance from the common obligor. For example, if A and B together lend two hundred dollars to C, and it is agreed that each can have the right to seek the whole amount from C upon repayment, C's obligation to repay the money is solidary for the obligees A and B. Generally, full payment to any of the solidary obligees extinguishes the obligation. A common example of solidary obligations for the obligees is a joint bank account; when two or more names are on an account, they are obligees of the bank's obligation to make funds available on demand. Each obligee would have the right to withdraw the whole amount in the bank account. Solidary obligations for obligors This is known as passive solidarity. An obligation is solidary for the obligors when each obligor is liable for the whole performance in such a way that a whole performance rendered by one of the obligors relieves the others of liability toward the obligee. In practice, this is much more frequent than active solidarity. When one co-signs a loan for another, they both become solidary obligors in relation to the debt owed. In regard to liability of the obligors between themselves, the proportions owed by each obligor in a solidary obligation stemming from a contract are deemed to be equal unless a provision in the agreement states otherwise. Passive solidarity can also be created as an operation of law. In the case of an offense or a tort, if a person has sustained damage because of the shared fault of others, the offenders may be liable in solido in proportion to their fault. Renunciation of solidarity Since passive solidarity is mainly a guarantee and benefit for the creditor or obligee, he may renounce it at his pleasure. He may renounce it in favor of one or all of the obligors. If he renounces solidarity for only one of the obligors, this has the important effect of preserving his right to demand the whole performance from the remaining obligors bound in solido, minus the portion owed by the one whose solidarity was renounced. The other obligors could no longer seek any type of contribution from the renounced obligor if one were then required to render the whole performance. The renunciation of solidarity must be express, although it need not be done in any formal manner. Generally, renunciation of solidarity takes place when he received a partial payment from one of the obligors, although the payment itself does not imply a renunciation. Under the Louisiana Civil Code, an obligee who received a partial performance from an obligor separately will still preserve the solidary obligation against all of the obligors after deduction of that partial performance. Debt relief When the debt is cancelled, the creditor forgives the debt, thereby releasing that debtor from the whole obligation. In the context of a solidary obligation, if the obligee cancels the debt of some‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof the obligors, the obligation is reduced by an amount proportionate to those whose debts have been cancelled; the obligee preserves his right to demand the whole from any of the remaining obligors, although his right is limited only to the uncancelled debt. Unlike the renunciation of a solidary debt, a cancellation affects the object of the entire obligation. It is akin to entirely eliminating that obligor from the obligation. In order to cancel a debt, the traditional method is for the obligee to surrender the debt instrument that evidences the obligation to the obligor. Such a surrender creates a presumption that the debt cancellation was intended to benefit all solidary obligors; this may be rebutted by evidence showing the intent was only to cancel in favor of the obligor to whom the debt instrument was surrendered rather than all of the obligors. Insolvency of a solidary obligor If one of the solidary obligors becomes insolvent, such as through bankruptcy, his portion of the debt must be covered by each of the remaining solidary obligors in proportion to their own portions. The insolvency of one or more obligors does not affect the overall relationship between the obligors and the obligee, however, because he still can demand full performance from just one of them. Even if an obligor has had his solidarity renounced, he still must contribute in some way to make up for the loss resulting in another obligor becoming insolvent; all of the solidary obligors bear the loss arising from insolvency of a solidary obligor in proportion to their portions. However, an obligor who has had his solidarity renounced would never be liable for more than his fair portion if an obligor never becomes insolvent. In this way renunciation of solidarity can be viewed as a middle ground between complete obligation in solidum and from the complete freedom from obligation that debt cancellation results in. For example, assume A, B, C, and D are liable in solido to X for $10,000. This means of course that X can look to any of these four solidary obligors for the full amount. Assume that X renounces solidarity in favor of A, who pays X $2,500, and that B thereafter goes bankrupt. Unfortunately, there is still $7,500 owed to X, who can collect that amount from either C or D. A's share is now 1/3 (approximately $3,333) because his share has been affected by B's bankruptcy. Assuming the C pays X $7,500, he can seek contribution from D for $3,333 and from A for $833, which is his share of $3,333 minus the amount he already contributed of $2,500. Indemnity If the circumstances giving rise to the solidary obligation only concern one of the obligors, then that obligor is liable for the whole obligation. The other obligors are only considered sureties. This means that although the unconcerned parties may be forced to pay the obligee some or all of the money, they can seek the entirety of their contribution from the concerned obligor in full. Interruption of prescription The interruption of liberative prescription against one solidary obligor is effective against all of the solidary obligors. Thus, any action that would normally interrupt prescription as to one of the obligors will also prevent the debt from prescribing as to all of the other obligors.

Views on the language Brinton (1892) considered Alaguilac to be a dialect of Pipil. However, Campbell (1972) believes this is wrong. Brinton may have been misled by his sources: En 1576 Palacio reported the language of Acavastlan, Guatemala, which he called Tlacacebatleca.S. W. Miles \\"The sixteenth-century Pokom-Maya: a documentary analysis of social structure and archaeological setting\\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, 47:734-781 (1957), p. 739. Juarros mentioned that \\"Alag√ºilac\\" was spoken in San Crist√≥bal Acasaguastl√°n and \\"Mejicano\\" was spoken in San Agust√≠n Acasaguastl√°n.D. Domingo Juarros, A statistical and commercial history of the kingdom of Guatemala, translated by J. Baily. London, (1936), pp. 69-71. This started a debate on whether Alag√ºilac was a relative of Pipil. Since Briton found four pages, written between 1610 and 1637 in a Nahua dialect, in the archives of San Crist√≥bal Acasaguastl√°n, and further since in 1878 Bromowicz compiled a list of Nahua words in San Agust√≠n Acasaguastl√°n, Brinton concluded that Ag√ºilac was nothing more than a form of Nahua. Nonetheless, the archeological evidence does not support the language of the area being Nahua.A. L. Smith and A. V. Kidder, Explorations in the Motagua Valley, Guatemala, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Publication 546, Contribution 641. Others have suggested that Acaguastl√°n could have been bilingual in Pipil and a Maya language such as Poqomchi' or Poqomam. However, Campbell argues that the presence of the Pipil or Nahua in the Motagua River valley could have been the result of forced population movements after the Spanish Conquest. For example, the neighboring town of Salam√° was a Pipil community populated by slaves brought in by the Spanish governor, Pedro de Alvarado. He also argues that the Cakchiquels and Poqom expanded from the north into central Guatemala, where they encountered a Xinca population, as evidenced by the large number of Xinca words in these languages. He suggests therefore that Alag√ºilac may have been a Xinca language; many local place names appear to be of Xinca origin, such as Sanarate, Sansare, Sansur, and Ayampuc.In Xinca, ·π£an- is a locative; for example, Santa Mar√≠a Ixhuat√°n is in Xinca called ·π£an-piya 'place of jars', and Pasaco is ·π£an-pa·π£a î.

Park was one of the organizers of the Gapsin coup of 1884, in which progressive political elements attempted to overthrow the conservative Korean government. His courtesy name was Chungo, Hyeonhyeongeosa, and he later held the title of Count of Geumryung. Park was the son-in-law of King Cheoljong, the 25th king of the Joseon Dynasty. Early life and education Park was born in Suwon, south of Seoul. He was the third son of Park Won-yang (Î∞ïÏõêÏñë, 1804-1880), and his mother was Lady Yi (1817-1884) of the Jeonwi Yi clan; Park also had a distant connection with the royal family by birth: his 7-great-grandfather was Park Se-gyo (Êú¥‰∏ñÊ©ã/Î∞ïÏÑ∏Íµê, 1611-1663), the son of King Seonjo's 5th daughter, Princess Jinan (Ï†ïÏïàÏòπÏ£º, 1590-1660). In 1872, Park was chosen to be the spouse of Princess Yeonghye (ÏòÅÌòúÏòπÏ£º; Ê∞∏ÊÉ†ÁøÅ‰∏ª), the only living daughter of King Cheoljong, the 25th king of the Joseon Dynasty. However, the princess passed away merely three months later after their marriage. To retain their royal status, they never had a child together, and his children were all acknowledged as his children with the concubines. Later, together with Kim Ok-gyun, Park was a strong supporter of the Dongnipdang, or ‚ÄúEnlightenment Party‚Äù, which sought to reform the Korean government, economy, and military by incorporating Western technology and methodology, so that Korea would become stable enough in time to withstand increasing foreign encroachment. He accompanied Kim on his visit to Tokyo, meeting with various influential Japanese politicians, including Fukuzawa Yukichi. Personal Life After completing his studies at The University of Edinburgh, he has 3 children; Park Jin-seo, Park Il-seo, Park Myo-ok. 7 grandchildren; Park Seung-kwang, Park Joo-ok, Park Il-hwa, Lee In-won, Lee Dong-kyun, Park Min-do, Park Yun-bae. 7 great-grandchildren; Lee Ju-eun, Park Ja-seong, Lee Eun-ji, Park Yeong-ho, Park Da-bin, Park Seung-joo, Park Seong-ho. 12 great-great-grandchildren; Seo Ye-ra, Seo Ki-hyun, Seo Dae-han, Park Chan-hee, Park Jun-ho, Park Kang-bae, Ryu Chae-bin, Park Sol, Park Kye-na, Ryu Sa-bin, Ryu Yeon-bin, Park Yu-no. Career Park is credited with creating the first Korean national flag, in 1882.Bak Yeonghyo:Korean historical person information Gapsin Coup Park was one of the leaders of the 1884 Gapsin Coup that attempted to overthrow the Korean government and institute Western-style reforms. The coup attempt lasted only three days before its suppression by Chinese troops. Park was forced to flee to exile in Japan, where he initially stayed with Fukuzawa Yukichi, before moving on to Kobe. Subsequent career Park served briefly as Interior Minister in 1895, playing an important role in opening up Korea. However, following the Gabo Reform and the assassination of Queen Min, Park fled to exile in Japan, where he remained until 1907. On his return, he accepted the post of Royal Household Minister under Ye Wanyong. Following the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, in which Korea was annexed to the Empire of Japan, Park was awarded with the kazoku title of marquess (koshaku) in the Japanese peerage, and a seat in the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan. He served as Director of the Bank of Chosen in 1918, Chairman of the Korean Economic Association in 1919, first president of The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper in 1920, president of the Kyungbang Corporation, chairman of the Korea Industrialization Bank in 1921, and advisor to the Government-General of Korea‚Äôs Central Institute.

Brillante was a slave ship that the Royal Navy succeeded in capturing after two failed attempts. The brig had a crew of sixty men and was armed with ten guns. Brillante was under the command of an English captain named Homans when she was seized. Homans was an experienced slaver who in ten cruises had landed 5,000 slaves on the coasts of Brazil and Cuba. Brillante reportedly fought at least two battles against the British anti-slavery patrols. She allegedly forced the crew of one British cruiser to abandon ship after a bloody action and on a different occasion, she repulsed boats from a Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Finally, four navy vessels trapped Brillante by surrounding her. Just before his capture, Captain Homans murdered around 600 slaves by ordering that their hands be tied to the ship's anchor and that they be thrown over the side.

In addition, the ground from 2003 to 2009 hosted Guernsey's Muratti games before the future games were moved to The Track due to fans complaining that the presence of the athletics track between the grandstands and the pitch put the spectators too far away from the game action. It is also noted that Guernsey did not win a single Muratti while playing at Footes Lane. The ground is also used for athletics as seen by the running track around the outside of the pitch. Footes Lane in addition hosts the annual Guernsey Marathon and was also used for the athletics events at the 2003 Island Games. In addition, field hockey is also played there, mainly hosting Guernsey's representative team.

The river flows in a north-easterly direction from a source high on Mount Kenya around Ithangune and Rutundu hills from where it flows easterly through thick equatorial rainforests towards Meru Town, and in a southeasterly direction into River Tana. It is the northernmost of the Mt. Kenya tributaries of the Tana River. Geography Unlike many other rivers tracing their source on the Kenyan moor land, the Kathita River is unique as it is formed by the melting glaciers on the peaks of Mount Kenya. Hence the reason why its water is very cold at all seasons, even the piped water from this river is this distinct in this attribute of being cold. The Kathita follows a meandering course skirting through the small village towns of Kithaku, Katheri, Kaing'inyo, Gitimbene and finally cuts through the heart of the Meru Town Meru. Kathita river has got a unique attribute in that its watercourse runs through deep gorges, due to this engineering works for water irrigation projects on Kathita river is very costly. In the olden days the Wameru had unique log bridges which were used to cross the Kathita river along its deep gorged course. Many of those log bridges are still in operation.

The documents consist of classified assessments, interviews, and internal memos about detainees, which were written by the Pentagon's Joint Task Force Guantanamo, headquartered at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The documents are marked \\"secret\\" and NOFORN (information that is not to be shared with representatives of other countries). Media reports on the documents note that more than 150 innocent Afghans and Pakistanis, including farmers, chefs, and drivers, were held for years without charges. The documents also reveal that some of the prison's youngest and oldest detainees, who include Mohammed Sadiq, an 89-year-old man, and Naqib Ullah, a 14-year-old boy, suffered from fragile mental and physical conditions. The files contain statements from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 attacks, who said that al- Qaeda possessed nuclear capacity and would use it to retaliate for any attack on Osama bin Laden. Source of the leak The New York Times said it received the documents from an anonymous source other than WikiLeaks, and it shared them with other news outlets such as NPR and The Guardian. WikiLeaks suggested on Twitter that the source might be Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former associate. WikiLeaks noted that \\"our first partner, The Telegraph, published the documents at 1:00 AM GMT, long before NYT or Guardian.\\" The Guardian reported that the Guantanamo Bay files were \\"among hundreds of thousands of documents\\" that U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning was accused of having turned over to WikiLeaks in 2010. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) said the documents remained legally classified despite the leaks. It informed the lawyers who represent the prisoners in Guantanamo that they were not allowed to read the documents, which have been published by The New York Times and other major media outlets. The U.S. government issued a statement: \\"It is unfortunate that The New York Times and other news organizations have made the decision to publish numerous documents obtained illegally by WikiLeaks concerning the Guantanamo detention facility.\\" The documents seem to be \\"Detainee Assessment Briefs\\" (DABs) written between 2002 and 2009 and \\"may or may not represent the current view of a given detainee.\\" Notable elements The Guardian noted that, despite the government's claim of having detained dangerous militants, the files, which covered almost all the prisoners held since 2002, revealed an emphasis of holding people to extract intelligence. Although many prisoners were assessed as not posing a threat to security, they were nonetheless detained for lengths of time. The files showed that nearly 100 detainees had been diagnosed with depressive or psychotic illnesses. The United States tried to retain British nationals and legal residents, such as Jamal al-Harith and Binyam Mohamed, for intelligence value, although its agents knew neither were members of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, and Mohamed had been tortured, so any \\"evidence\\" he provided was suspect due to that fact. The Guardian noted that the files revealed that the U.S. relied strongly on evidence obtained from a relatively few number of detainees, most of whom had been tortured. One detainee made allegations against more than 100 other detainees, so many that his accusations should have been considered suspect. The U.S. issued guidance to its interrogators that was based on assumptions of threat based on flimsy associations ‚Äì through attendance at particular mosques, stays at certain guest houses in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and other elements. The Guantanamo Files revealed that Sami al-Hajj, an Al Jazeera journalist and cameraman, was detained from 2002 to 2008, allegedly in part so that U.S. officials could interrogate him about the news network. According to the file, he was detained \\"to provide information on ... the al-Jazeera news network's training programme, telecommunications equipment, and newsgathering operations in Chechnya, Kosovo and Afghanistan, including the network's acquisition of a video of UBL [Osama bin Laden] and a subsequent interview with UBL.\\" He was considered to be \\"a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests, and allies\\" and \\"of HIGH intelligence value.\\" Sami al-Haji has said that he was beaten and sexually assaulted in detention. His lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, also legal director of the British organisation Reprieve, said that the U.S. had tried to force al-Haji to become an informant against his employers. Threat by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Other documents cited Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 attacks, saying that if Osama bin Laden was captured or killed by U.S. allies, an Al- Qaeda sleeper cell would detonate a \\"weapon of mass destruction\\" in a \\"secret location\\" in Europe. He said it would be \\"a nuclear hellstorm\\". By March 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded at least 183 times by the CIA, which held him in custody until September 2006, when he was transferred to Guantanamo. No such attack has occurred following the killing of bin Laden in May 2011. Al-Qaeda has vowed to retaliate. Reactions WikiLeaks has said that, as with previous releases, at least as important as the content of the published documents is that readers should note the reaction of each media news outlet. For instance, WikiLeaks suggested \\"[comparing] the first paragraph of these two stories about the same thing\\" by BBC and CNN. The BBC version opened with the following statement: CNN stated: The contrast between foreign and United States media was noted by several journalists, including Glenn Greenwald of Salon. He described the differences as \\"stark, predictable and revealing\\". He wrote, \\"Foreign newspapers highlight how these documents show U.S. actions to be so oppressive and unjust, while American newspapers downplayed that fact.\\" See also * Black jail * Black site * Dark prison * Detainees in CIA custody * Internment Serial Number ReferencesExternal links * The Guantanamo Files by WikiLeaks Category:2011 in international relations Category:2011 scandals Category:Guantanamo Bay detention camp Category:Iraq War prisoners of war Category:21st-century military history of the United States Category:Information published by WikiLeaks Category:April 2011 events in North America Category:Classified information in the United States ","title":"Guantanamo Bay files leak"},{"id":"31589028","title":"VF bandwidth"},{"id":"31589045","text":"A chromate ester is a chemical structure that contains a chromium atom (symbol Cr) in a +6 oxidation state that is connected via an oxygen (O) linkage to a carbon (C) atom.

It is known as one of the main restaurants of the resort, and specialises in table services. Concept When designing Euro Disneyland, Imagineers wanted to create a place which would act as a tribute to Walt Disney, since European guests were not as acquainted to his life as American guests were. Imagineer Eddie Sotto wanted this place to be designed as a Club 33 for the average guests. The Restaurant=Ground Floor * Lobby: The restaurant's lobby features many items referring to Walt and his achievements. His bust stands in the center of the room, along with devices from the early pre-animation era, such as a Zoetrope. A staircase and an elevator lead guests to the upper floor. As they ascend to it, they can see photos of Walt's reach for his fame, from the creation of Mickey Mouse and the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim. (Note: The following rooms were removed in 1999) * Walt Disney's Room: The room paid tribute to Walt Disney's life. Here items referred to his early youth in Marceline, Missouri. * Lillian Disney's Room: This room paid tribute to Lillian Disney, Walt's wife. Some photographs showed the couple in their journeys around Europe. The room featured an elegant fireplace (still visible today) and many china items which Lillian was fond of. * Main Street Room: This dining room was ornamented with Imagineer Herbert Ryman's artworks for Main Street, U.S.A., and a model of the Main Street Transportation Building. The purpose of this room was to underline the link between Main Street and Marceline, Missouri. Flower Street featured an outside seating area along the restaurant's facade. Upper Floor The upper floor features six themed rooms: * Fantasyland Room: This gothic-style room presents an early vision of Fantasyland. Here are displayed artworks and sculptures representing scenes or characters from Disney movies based on European tales, such as Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, Peter Pan or Alice in Wonderland. Concept-arts for the Castle are also visible. * Adventureland Room: This oriental-style room features exotic items from Africa or Asia. Artworks refer to the land's attractions such as Adventure Isle, but the influence of Imagineer Marc Davis is underlined by his sketches for the ride Pirates of the Caribbean and the never-built Jungle Cruise ride. * Discoveryland Room: To underline Jules Verne's strong influence on Discoveryland, the room displays a huge collection of illustrations from his books Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, From the Earth to the Moon and others. The fireplace is ornamented with a golden model of the Nautilus, and photographs along the walls remind guests of the production of the Disney movie 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Other artworks present Tony Baxter's Discovery Bay which was the basic inspiration for the land, the now-gone Visionarium with one photograph of Michel Piccoli's portrayal of Verne, and the Orbitron ride. * Disneyland Hotel Room: This small room features artworks for Disneyland Hotel, especially sketches which inspired the building's architecture. Nowadays, some consider this room to be Main Street Room, since the one on the ground floor was removed. * Grand Canyon Room: This small room adjacent to the main Frontierland room displays drawings for the Grand Canyon scene visible from the Disneyland Railroad attraction. * Frontierland Room: This library-like room bears the theme of Thunder Mesa. Here are displayed artworks of Big Thunder Mountain, Phantom Manor or Thunder Mesa Riverboats. Trivia * The restaurant is located on 1401, Flower Street, which is also the location of Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, California. * The three dining rooms located on the ground floor were removed in 1999 to make way for Lilly's Boutique, a shop themed to Lillian Disney, and designed to sell home items. Most of the props from Lillian Disney's room were reused to decorate the shop, and the fireplace still stands in this place. * The piano and violin soundtrack of the restaurant features a wide selection of popular Disney tunes, from the beginning of the Company (Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?) to Disneyland Paris opening (Under the Sea).

He first came to prominence in the mid-1990s with the Dirty Stop Out's Guide to Sheffield, which was published at the height of the dance club explosion of the era. This tour around the highlights and lowlights of Sheffield at night attracted critical acclaim from titles including The Rough Guide to England, DJ Magazine and The Times. His Take It to the Limit book about legendary venue The Limit, which ran on Sheffield's West Street from 1978 to 1991, became a best-seller in 2009. Launched by Sex Pistol Glen Matlock, the book's launch party was attended by members of the Human League, Pulp, Artery, Vice Versa (who later became ABC) and other bands who played early gigs at the venue. Sheffield's Date With Hitler was published in 2010 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Sheffield Blitz. The book formed the basis of BBC1's Sheffield The Forgotten Blitz documentary and followed over a year of research and attempts to explain why the city's munitions works were largely missed by the Luftwaffe on 12 and 15 December 1940. Also in 2010, Anderson wrote Signing on for the Devil which chronicled Sheffield's heavy metal music dominance in the 1980s. His Dirty Stop Out's Guide to 1970s Sheffield became known countrywide as the book that reunited Chris and Ann Jackson and inspired them to get remarried after 26 years apart. Anderson is a regular contributor to the international music magazine Vive Le Rock. He is working on projects including citywide plans to mark the 75th anniversary of the Sheffield Blitz and the Dirty Stop Out's Guide to Working Men's Clubs. He also runs PR/publishing company Neil Anderson Media. Background Sheffield-born Anderson has been a music and entertainment writer/journalist since leaving Sheffield Hallam University in the mid-1990s. He was a Sheffield Telegraph columnist for over a decade and has written for titles spanning The Independent to The Big Issue. Anderson originally started out as a hairdresser but landed a job in Sheffield City Hall's publicity office whilst still at university and never looked back. He was soon promoted to Sheffield City Council's press office and made a name for himself with campaigns to develop the city's Cultural Industries Quarter and getting magazines like The Face and Kerrang! to feature his council promotions. He left in 2000 to pursue his media career.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 27, 2011. In the episode, Kyle is kidnapped after agreeing to an iTunes user agreement, and forced to become part of a \\"revolutionary new product\\" that is about to be launched by Apple. Meanwhile, Cartman, who has not acquired an Apple iPad, pesters his mother on the issue, drawing her ire. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode's title, and main plot, refers to the 2009 film The Human Centipede (First Sequence). This episode parodies reports about tracking software built into Apple's iPads and iPhones, and also the tediously long end-user license agreements. The making of the episode was the subject of the TV special, 6 Days to Air, which aired on Comedy Central on October 9, 2011. Plot After fourth grader Eric Cartman boasts to his classmates of owning an iPad, and mocks them for not having one, he is humiliated when it is revealed that he actually does not own one. When he and his mother Liane go to Best Buy to buy an iPad, the item's exorbitant price prompts her to suggest buying a less expensive Toshiba HandiBook. The demanding Cartman, who had his mind set on the iPad as a status symbol, loudly excoriates her in the middle of the store, accusing her of \\"fucking\\" him. The embarrassed Liane decides to leave the store without buying Eric anything. Meanwhile, Cartman's classmate and frequent nemesis Kyle Broflovski, who did not read the Terms and Conditions when agreeing to download the latest iTunes update, is pursued by shadowy agents from Apple Inc., who wish to perform a number of intrusive acts upon him, informing him that he agreed to them when he downloaded the update. Kyle attempts to flee the men, and is incredulous when his friends inform him that they all read the entire Terms and Conditions when they downloaded the latest update. Kyle seeks refuge at his father Gerald's law office, but the Apple agents taser his father, kidnap Kyle, and throw him in a cage with a Japanese man and a young woman who also failed to read the fine print of their purchased updates. At a Stevenote address, Steve Jobs unveils the new product for which Kyle and the other two were kidnapped: the HUMANCENTiPAD, comprising the three kidnapped subjects on all fours and sewn together mouth to anus. The Japanese man is in front, with an iPhone attached to his forehead; Kyle is in the middle; and the woman is at the rear, with an iPad attached to her anus. However, Jobs is disappointed when Kyle continues to sign agreements that are put in front of him without reading them first, and puts the \\"device\\" through tests in an attempt to make it read. Meanwhile, Cartman appears on the talk show Dr. Phil to publicly accuse Liane of \\"fucking\\" him. The audience misunderstands this to mean that she has sexually molested him. As a consolation gift, Cartman is given the first ever HUMANCENTiPAD as Jobs unveils it to the public. Cartman is elated to have a device that not only supports web browsing and email, but also enables him to induce someone to defecate into Kyle's mouth. Seeking to free his son, Gerald goes with Kyle's friends to an Apple Store, where the customer service agents known as \\"the Geniuses\\", after considerable deliberations, determine that they can void Kyle's agreement if Gerald, a PC user, signs up with Apple and creates a family account. Gerald consents, after which he, the Geniuses and Kyle's friends go to the studio where Dr. Phil is produced. Jobs, complying with Gerald's new deal, reluctantly makes preparations to have Kyle separated from his two fellow victims. This enrages Cartman, whose dream is now being quashed. Cartman looks up to the heavens and angrily excoriates God, after which he is struck by a bolt of lightning. He is then shown recuperating in a hospital bed, crying while his mother flips through a book indifferently. Reception In its original American broadcast on April 27, 2011, \\"HUMANCENTiPAD\\" was watched by 3.108 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Reviewing the episode for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker called the episode \\"scabrously funny\\" and summed up its message as \\"[k]nowledge really matters; many people are lazy and consequently become prey to exploitation\\". Ramsey Iser of IGN rated the episode 7.5 out of 10. He said the episode was \\"a decent opening\\" for the season, but criticized it for overuse of Cartman's accusations against his mother, generic jokes about Apple's \\"Geniuses\\", and \\"poop jokes ... [that] didn't do much for the story or the comedy\\". ReferencesExternal links * \\"HUMANCENTiPAD\\". South Park Studios * \\"HUMANCENTiPAD\\".

L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Nuclear II, 1946 (Milwaukee art museum) Conception and origins In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks. The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer Y≈çsuke Yamahata began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine Asahi Gurafu published them. Historical nuclear art in Italy In 1948, the artistic movement of Eaismo published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the atomic age and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of nuclear power.G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Societ√† Editrice Italiana, Livorno, 1948 It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist Voltolino Fontani, aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by the danger of nuclear radiation. The artistic group was strengthened by the poet Marcello Landi and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an atom on canvas, by creating the artwork: Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi. In 1951 the painters Enrico Baj and Sergio Dangelo created the , criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, Milano 1994 Plenty of Italian artists, in Milan and Naples, and foreigners like Yves Klein, Asger Jorn, Arman, Antonio Saura joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was Piero Manzoni, who in this context, for the first time in his life, put his talent in evidence. Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry), the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized. Historical nuclear art in Spain In the meantime, Spanish painter Salvador Dal√¨ published the Mystical manifesto (1951), putting Catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together. In this period Dal√¨ created artworks like Idillio atomico (1945) and Leda Atomica (1949). Historical nuclear art in France In 1949 the French artist Bernard Lorjou started to paint his monumental artwork ‚Äúl‚Äôage atomique‚Äù (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the Centre Pompidou. Historical nuclear art in the United States The painter and photographer Eugene Von Bruenchenhein painted the artwork ‚ÄúAtomic age‚Äù in 1955, and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965. The British sculptor Henry Moore created a bronze public sculpture entitled Nuclear Energy (sculpture) (1967), which both depicted the fatality of nuclear weapons and celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the Chicago Pile-1, under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid mushroom cloud and human skull. Contemporary approaches to nuclear art=Japan Y≈çsuke Yamahata, NagasakiSurvivors1945 After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, Tatsuo Miyajima, Shimpei Takeda, Fuyuki Yamakawa, Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki. In 2015 an exhibition was organized in the Fukushima exclusion zone, \\"Don't Follow the Wind\\" by curator, Kenji Kubota, that includes the work of 12 international artists. North America The cultural critic, Akira Mizuta Lippit, has written that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the most significant photographic and cinematic event of the 20th Century. There have been numerous exhibitions of photographic works, including the 2015 show, Camera Atomica, at the Art Gallery of Ontario, exhibiting two hundred works.

It is the taurine conjugate form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Humans are found to have trace amounts of TUDCA. However, bears contain large amounts of TUDCA in their bile; UDCA and conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. TUDCA has been used in ancient Asian pharmacopoeias for its supposed beneficial effects. UDCA is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and liver cirrhosis. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, in the U.S. while UDCA is approved in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis Ongoing research is finding TUDCA has diminishing apoptotic effects, with potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Recently, TUDCA has been found to have protective effects in the eye, especially concerning retinal degenerative disorders.  History  Chinese medicine has used animal bile for hundreds of years as a medicine to treat \\"heat\\" illnesses. It was used to relieve spasms, reduce fever, and improve visual acuity. Bile is naturally synthesized via cholesterol, consisting of compounds including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. However, UDCA and TUDCA were first synthetically developed in 1954 in Japan.  Cellular mechanism  Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release the molecule cytochrome C (cyC). Cytochrome C initiates enzymes called caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. TUDCA prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. BAX, a molecule that is translocated to the mitochondria to release cytochrome C, initiates the cellular pathway of apoptosis. TUDCA prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria. This protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. TUDCA also acts as a chemical chaperone.  Current research  Studies in recent years are continually showing ocular protective effects via TUDCA.  Photoreceptor cells  A study examined the effects of TUDCA on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with TUDCA every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of TUDCA. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the TUDCA treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. TUDCA treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and TUDCA, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or TUDCA were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or TUDCA were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment  Choroidal neovascularization  A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of TUDCA and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. TUDCA and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and TUDCA treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the TUDCA treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. TUDCA and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects.  Synaptic connectivity  A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of TUDCA in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with TUDCA once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in TUDCA treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in TUDCA treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the TUDCA treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of TUDCA are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP.

He was a son of Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill, and thus a member of the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ branch of Clann Somhairle. Ail√©an was a brother of Dubhghall mac Ruaidhr√≠, King of Argyll and the Isles, a significant figure who held power in the mid thirteenth century. At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown. In 1259, Dubhghall's daughter married the son of King of Connacht, and Ail√©an is recorded to have commanded the woman's tocher of one hundred and sixty gallowglass warriors. When the Scottish Crown encroached into Isles in the 1260s, Dubhghall and Ail√©an were noted supporters of the Norwegian cause. Both men played a prominent role in the Norwegian campaign against the Scots in 1263. Following the collapse of the operation and further pressure, the Norwegians agreed to hand the Isles over to the Scots. Although Dubhghall is last attested resisting the Scots later that decade, Ail√©an and most of his Clann Somhairle kinsman integrated themselves into the Scottish realm. The record of his part in the ruthless suppression of a Manx revolt in 1275, and his participation in a parliamentary council concerning the inheritance of Scottish throne in 1284, both evidence the incorporation of Clann Somhairle into the kingdom. Clann Ruaidhr√≠ Locations relating to the life and times of Ail√©an. Ail√©an and his brother, Dubhghall, were sons of Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill, Lord of Kintyre.Holton (2017) p. viii fig. 2; Fisher (2005) p. 86 fig. 5.2; Brown (2004) p. 77 tab. 4.1; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; Roberts (1999) p. 99 fig. 5.2; McDonald (1997) p. 258 genealogical tree ii; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 279 tab. 1; Rixson (1982) p. 14 fig. 1.

In the second decade of the thirteenth-century, Ruaidhr√≠ is known to have conducted military operations in Ireland with Thomas fitz Roland, Earl of Atholl, younger brother of Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway.Duffy (2007) p. 10 n. 43; Duffy (1991) p. 68. The close relations between these families could account for Ail√©an's name.Duffy (2007) p. 10 n. 43; Duffy (1993) p. 77 n. 61. In 1247, a certain Mac Somhairle‚Äîperhaps Ruaidhr√≠ himself‚Äîwas killed whilst resisting an English invasion of T√≠r Chonaill.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Woolf (2007) p. 77; Power (2005) p. 46; Brown (2004) pp. 80‚Äì81; Duffy (2004) p. 47; Woolf (2004) p. 108; Verstraten (2003) p. 36 n. 131; Sellar (2000) pp. 200‚Äì201; Bartlett (1999) p. 821; Lydon (1992) p. 7; Ballyshannon (n.d.); Mac Somhairle (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 91 (n.d.).

Although the entirety of the ' roughly encompassed the Hebrides and Mann,Dumville (2018) p. 113; McDonald (2012) p. 152; Williams, G (2007) pp. 130‚Äì132 n. 8. the precise jurisdiction which Dubhghall and E√≥ghan competed for is uncertain. For example, the northern Hebridean islands of Lewis and Harris and Skye appear to have been held by the Crovan dynasty, then represented by the reigning Haraldr √ìl√°fsson, King of Mann and the Isles.Holton (2017) p. 129; McDonald (1997) p. 99; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207. It is conceivable that E√≥ghan and Dubhghall sought kingship over the same jurisdiction that H√°kon had awarded to √ìspakr- H√°kon about a decade before‚Äîa region which could have included some or all of the islands possessed by Clann Somhairle.W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49 n. 66; McDonald (1997) p. 99; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207. In fact, it is possible that the aforesaid events of 1247 and 1248 were related,Oram (2013) ch. 6; Woolf (2007) p. 83; Sellar (2000) p. 201. and that Dubhghall and E√≥ghan sought to succeed Mac Somhairle's position in the Isles.Woolf (2007) pp. 83‚Äì84.

It was only after the unexpected death of Haraldr in 1248 that H√°kon sent E√≥ghan west-over-sea to temporarily take up the kingship of the Isles on his behalf.McDonald (2019) p. 33; Holton (2017) p. 129; Oram (2013) ch. 6; W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49, 49 n. 66; Beuermann (2010) p. 108, 108 n. 29; Woolf (2007) p. 84; Power (2005) p. 46; Carpenter (2004) p. 337; Sellar (2004); Stringer (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 204; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207. E√≥ghan, however, was not only a Norwegian dependant in the Isles, but an eminent Scottish magnate on the mainland.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Sellar (2004); Woolf (2004) p. 108.

E√≥ghan's acceptance of H√°kon's commission partly led Alexander II, King of Scotland to unleash an invasion of Argyll in the summer of 1249, directed at the very heart of the Clann Dubhghaill lordship.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Oram (2011b) ch. 13; Oram (2005) p. 42; Brown (2004) p. 80; Carpenter (2004) p. 337; Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 204; Barrow (1981) pp. 115‚Äì116.

E√≥ghan appears to have been utterly dispossessed by the Scots a result of their invasion.McDonald (1997) pp. 103‚Äì104. In fact, his apparent displacement could well have upended the hierarchy of Clann Somhairle.McDonald (1997) pp. 99, 104. For instance, a particular entry preserved by the Icelandic annals states that, within the very year that E√≥ghan was forced from Argyll by the Scots, Dubhghall himself \\"took kingship\\" in the Isles.Holton (2017) pp. 131‚Äì132; Raven (2005) p. 58; McDonald (1997) pp. 99, 104; Storm (1977) pp. 132, 190, 482; Anderson (1922) p. 554, 554 n. 2; Vigfusson (1878) p. 374. This record could reveal that Dubhghall and E√≥ghan shared kingship in the Hebrides,Holton (2017) p. 130 n. 33. or that Dubhghall assumed the kingship from a severely weakened E√≥ghan.Holton (2017) pp. 130 n. 33, 132; McDonald (1997) pp. 99, 104.

It was at this convention, at Caol Uisce on the River Erne, that Aodh‚Äîson of the King of Connacht‚Äîand Tadhg‚Äîson of the King of Thomond‚Äîrelinquished their claims to the high-kingship of Ireland in favour of Brian, who was then proclaimed high king.Duffy (2007) pp. 17‚Äì18; Jefferies (2005); Simms (2005a); Simms (2005b); Verstraten (2003) p. 27; Verstraten (2002) p. 15; O'Byrne (2001) pp. 107‚Äì108; Bartlett (1999) p. 822; Lydon (1994) p. 153; Martin, FX (1994) p. 142; Moody; Martin (1994) p. 432; Duffy (1993) p. 124; Duffy (1991) pp. 69‚Äì70; Walton (1980) p. 232. The latter was then in midst of campaigning against a temporarily weakened English Earldom of Ulster, and closely allied with Aodh in his cause.Duffy (2007) p. 18; Simms (2005b); Bartlett (1999) pp. 821‚Äì822; Simms (1998) pp. 79‚Äì80; Walton (1980) pp. 231‚Äì232. The following year, the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Connacht, the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√©, and the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters reveal that Aodh travelled to Derry and married a daughter of Dubhghall, and thereby received a tocher that included one hundred and sixty gallowglass warriors commanded by Ail√©an himself.Downham (2018) p. 229; Holton (2017) p. 133; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1259.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1259.5; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1259.6; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1259.6; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1259.3; Lydon (2008) pp. 245, 248; Duffy (2007) pp. 1, 10 n. 43, 18; Kenny (2007) p. 68; Kenny (2006) p. 33; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1259.3; Kenny (2005) p. 103; McLeod (2005) p. 43, n. 79; Power (2005) p. 49; Verstraten (2003) pp. 26, 36 n. 131; Simms (2001) p. 6; Sellar (2000) p. 206, 206 n. 99; Simms (2000a) pp. 121‚Äì122; Simms (2000b) p. 157 n. 62; McDonald (1997) pp. 118, 155; Duffy (1993) p. 127; Lydon (1992) p. 7; Duffy (1991) pp. 69‚Äì70, 73; Walton (1980) pp. 233‚Äì234, 234 n. 134; Derry (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 131 (n.d.). Ail√©an is, therefore, one of the earliest known warriors of this type.Duffy (1991) p. 73. The marital alliance was conducted at the main port within Brian's realm, a site indicating that the union‚Äîalong with the aforesaid assembly and naval operations of the previous year‚Äîwas part of a carefully coordinated plan to tackle English power in the north west of Ireland.Duffy (2007) pp. 17‚Äì18. Unfortunately for these confederates, Tadhg was dead by 1259, and the combined forces of Aodh and Brian were utterly crushed in battle at Downpatrick in 1260, with Brian amongst the slain.Downham (2018) p. 258; Duffy (2007) pp. 18‚Äì19; Simms (2005a); Simms (2005b); Verstraten (2005); Verstraten (2003) pp. 27, 36 n. 142; Verstraten (2002) p. 15; O'Byrne (2001) p. 108, 108 n. 556; Simms (2001) p. 6; Simms (1998) p. 80; Lydon (1994) p. 153; Moody; Martin (1994) p. 432; Duffy (1993) p. 125; Walton (1980) p. 236. Despite this catastrophe, the phenomenon of eminent Irish lords importing heavily-armed mercenaries from the Isles and western Scotland became more prevalent in the later part of the century,McLeod (2005) p. 43; Simms (2000a) p. 122; Bartlett (1999) p. 821. and helped to even the military superiority enjoyed by English forces over native Irish troops.Simms (1998) p. 76; Martin, FX (1994) p. 142. Generally, English knights were superior to comparatively lightly-armed Irish horsemen. Gallowglasses fought in formations fashioned to counteract the devastating charge of such knights.O'Byrne (2005). The Clann Ruaidhr√≠ dowry of these warriors may well have fought at the aforesaid battle at Downpatrick,Lydon (2008) p. 245; Duffy (2007) p. 19. although the fact that Brian's forces were defeated by local English levies lends little evidence to their capabilities.Lydon (2008) p. 245. Ail√©an's position at the head of such a unit may well have been similar to that of Mac Somhairle,Duffy (2007) p. 1. who could well have led gallowglasses at the time of his death.Duffy (2007) p. 1; Simms (2000a) p. 121; McDonald (1997) p. 155; Simms (1996) p. 78. Norwegian magnate Locations relating to the expedition into the Lennox. With the aforesaid death of Alexander II in 1249, the Scottish invasion of the Argyll and the Isles came to an abrupt end. About a decade later, the latter's son and royal successor, Alexander III, came of age and took steps to continue his father's westward expansion.Reid (2011); W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18. In 1262, the year after yet another failed attempt by the Scottish Crown to purchase the Isles, the thirteenth-century H√°konar saga H√°konarsonar reports that the Scots lashed out against the Islesmen in a particularly savage attack upon the inhabitants of Skye.MacInnes (2019) p. 129 n. 52; #C7Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 46‚Äì47; Broun (2007) p. 4; Barrow (2006) p. 146; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 256; McDonald (2003) pp. 56, 132; McDonald (1997) p. 106; Duffy (1993) p. 109; Cowan (1990) pp. 117‚Äì118, 130 n. 70; Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 106; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 212; Matheson (1950) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 605; Dasent (1894) pp. 339‚Äì340 ch. 314; Vigfusson (1887) p. 327 ch. 314; Unger (1871) p. 569 ch. 322; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 217 ch. 274. Thus provoked, H√°kon assembled an enormous fleet‚Äîdescribed by the Icelandic annals as the largest force to have ever set sail from NorwayMcDonald (1997) p. 107; Storm (1977) p. 135; Anderson (1922) p. 607; Vigfusson (1878) p. 377; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 534.‚Äîto reassert Norwegian sovereignty along the north and western coast of Scotland.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) p. 107. In July 1263, this armada disembarked from Norway, and by mid August, H√°kon reaffirmed his overlordship in Shetland and Orkney, forced the submission of Caithness, and arrived in the Hebrides.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 107‚Äì108. In early September, H√°kon's fleet of Norwegians and Islesmen entered the Firth of Clyde.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) pp. 18‚Äì19. When negotiations between the Scottish and Norwegian administrations broke down, the saga identifies Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Mann and the Isles, Dubhghall, Ail√©an, Aonghus M√≥r Mac Domhnaill, and Murchadh Mac Suibhne, as the commanders of a detachment of Islesmen and Norwegians who entered Loch Long, portaged across land into Loch Lomond, and ravaged the surrounding region of the Lennox.James (2013) p. 1; Cox (2010) pp. 53‚Äì54; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 38; McDonald (1997) pp. 112‚Äì113; Cowan (1990) p. 121; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 213; Anderson (1922) pp. 625‚Äì626; Dasent (1894) pp. 354‚Äì355 ch. 323; Vigfusson (1887) p. 342 ch. 323; Unger (1871) p. 575 ch. 331; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 224 ch. 280. According various versions of the saga, this contingent consisted of either forty or sixty ships‚Äîa considerable portion of H√°kon's fleet.James (2013) p. 1; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 19; McDonald (1997) p. 112; Cowan (1990) p. 121; Anderson (1922) p. 625, 625 n. 6; Dasent (1894) p. 354 ch. 323; Vigfusson (1887) p. 342 ch. 323; Unger (1871) p. 575 ch. 331; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 224 ch. 280. Ail√©an's actions are specifically acclaimed by the saga, which states that he took several hundred head of cattle, and caused much destruction throughout mainland Scotland.Holton (2017) p. 143; McDonald (1997) p. 112; Cowan (1990) p. 121; Anderson (1922) p. 626; Dasent (1894) p. 355 ch. 323; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 342‚Äì343 ch. 323; Unger (1871) p. 576 ch. 331; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 224 ch. 280. This inland campaigning appears to be corroborated by Scottish exchequer records, as John Lamberton, Sheriff of Stirling is reported to have incurred expenses for the upkeep of \\"vigilant men\\" at Stirling Castle for the time when the Norwegian forces were in the area.Holton (2017) p. 143; McNiven (2011) p. 75, 75 n. 61; McDonald (1997) pp. 112‚Äì113; Cowan (1990) p. 121; Thomson (1836) p. *38; Simms (2000b) pp. 390‚Äì391; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 ¬ß 178. There is reason to suspect that the operation in Loch Lomond is evidence that the Norwegians and Islesmen were directing their fury at the territories of the Stewarts.Holton (2017) p. 142; McNiven (2011) p. 75; Boardman, S (2006) p. 30 n. 35; Raven (2005) p. 59; Roberts (1999) p. 110; McDonald (1997) p. 113; Cowan (1990) pp. 121‚Äì122. Furthermore, by penetrating into the Earldom of Lennox, and possibly striking further east inland, H√°kon's adherents would have been encroaching into the Earldom of Menteith.Holton (2017) p. 142; McNiven (2011) p. 75; Boardman, S (2006) p. 30 n. 35; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 19; Roberts (1999) p. 110; Cowan (1990) pp. 121‚Äì122. rook gaming pieces of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Strickland (2012) p. 113 fig. 3.3; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6c, 184 fig. 11, 189 fig. 16. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. Meanwhile, at the beginning of October, H√°kon's main force clashed with the Scots at Largs, and withdrew into the Hebrides.Martin, C (2014) pp. 186‚Äì187; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 260; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) pp. 19‚Äì20; McDonald (1997) pp. 113‚Äì114; Cowan (1990) p. 122. Once regrouped with the detachment of Islesmen, the saga records that H√°kon rewarded his overseas supporters. Since E√≥ghan had refused to aid the Norwegians cause, Dubhghall and Ail√©an were awarded his forfeited island territories. A certain Ru√∞ri (fl. 1263) is stated to have received Bute, whilst Murchadh got Arran.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 260; Power (2005) p. 53; McDonald (1997) pp. 114‚Äì115, 115 n. 43; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 213, 213 n. 1; Anderson (1922) p. 635, 635 n. 7; Dasent (1894) pp. 362‚Äì363 ch. 326; Vigfusson (1887) p. 350 ch. 326; Unger (1871) p. 579 ch. 334; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 227 ch. 281. Although the saga declares that the operation was an overwhelming triumph, it seems to have been an utter failure instead.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 260‚Äì261; McDonald (1997) p. 115; Cowan (1990) pp. 122‚Äì123; Anderson (1922) p. 635; Dasent (1894) p. 363 ch. 326; Vigfusson (1887) p. 350 ch. 326; Unger (1871) p. 579 ch. 334; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 227 ch. 281. Not only did H√°kon fail to break Scottish power, but Alexander III seized the initiative the following year, and oversaw a series of invasions into the Isles and northern Scotland. Recognising this dramatic shift in royal authority, Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson submitted to Alexander III within the year,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 261‚Äì262; McDonald (1997) pp. 115‚Äì116; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 213‚Äì214. and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles.Brown (2004) p. 84. Dubhghall, on the other hand, contrasted many of his compatriots from the Isles, and stubbornly refused to submit to the Scottish Crown.Holton (2017) p. 143; Brown (2004) p. 84; Carpenter (2004) p. 389; McDonald (1997) pp. 116, 118; Rixson (1982) pp. 19, 79; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 214. In 1266, almost three years after H√°kon's abortive campaign, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the Scottish and Norwegian administrations. Specifically, with the conclusion of the Treaty of Perth in July, H√°kon's son and successor, Magn√∫s H√°konarson, King of Norway, formally resigned all rights to Mann and the islands on the western coast of Scotland. In so doing, the territorial dispute over Scotland's western maritime region was finally settled.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 263‚Äì264; Brown (2004) p. 84; Crawford, BE (2004) p. 38; Woolf (2004) pp. 108‚Äì109; McDonald (1997) pp. 119‚Äì121; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) pp. 420‚Äì421; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 8 ¬ß 9. Scottish magnate In the wake of the Scots' acquisition of the Isles, and Dubhghall's death within the decade, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ disappears from the Scottish historical record. When the kindred finally reemerges in 1275, it is in the person of Ail√©an himself, by then a prominent Scottish magnate,McDonald (2004) pp. 181, 183‚Äì184; McDonald (1997) pp. 130‚Äì131. and representative of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Holton (2017) p. 147.

Alexander III responded by sending a massive fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. Of the recorded commanders, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum reveals that two were members of Clann Somhairle: Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll, and Ail√©an himself.Holton (2017) pp. 145‚Äì146; Raven (2005) p. 60; McDonald (2004) p. 183; Oram (2000) p. 156; Duffy (1993) p. 163; Anderson (1908) pp. 382‚Äì383; Howlett (1885) p. 570. These two would have almost certainty been responsible for supplying and leading the host from the Hebrides and Argyll, and may have provided the fleet that transported the Scottish forces to Mann.McDonald (2004) p. 183. According to aforesaid sources, the Scots ruthlessly routed the rebels.McDonald (2019) pp. 37‚Äì38; Pollock (2015) pp. 192‚Äì193; McDonald (2007) pp. 54, 91 n. 18, 100 n. 56, 107; Raven (2005) p. 60; Carpenter (2004) p. 389; McDonald (2004) p. 183; Oram (2000) p. 156; Sellar (2000) p. 210; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duffy (1993) p. 163; Anderson (1922) pp. 672‚Äì673, 673 n. 1; Maxwell (1913) p. 11; Anderson (1908) p. 382; Howlett (1885) pp. 570‚Äì571; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 110‚Äì111, 232; Stevenson (1839) pp. 97‚Äì98. Despite the apparent ease at which the Manx were suppressed, the revolt clearly represented a grave threat to Scottish authority, as evidenced by the magnitude of the Scots' response. In fact, the Clann Somhairle dimension to this campaign, as agents of the Scottish Crown's authority, clearly exemplifies the extent at which the kindred had been incorporated into Scottish realm.Carpenter (2004) pp. 389‚Äì390; McDonald (2004) p. 183; Young (1990) p. 23. An excerpt from National Library of Scotland Advocates' 72.1.1 (MS 1467) showing a pedigree of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ concerning descendants of Ail√©an. The lineage runs: \\"'\\".Adv MS 72.1.1 (n.d.); Black; Black (n.d.). Western magnates like Ail√©an were rarely present at the Scottish royal court, although on certain occasions they participated in important affairs of state.Duncan (1996) pp. 582‚Äì583. For instance, in 1284, Ail√©an was one of the many such men who attended a government council at Scone which acknowledged Margaret, granddaughter of Alexander III, as the king's rightful heir.Holton (2017) p. 146; Findlater (2011) p. 69; McDonald (2006) p. 77; Power (2005) p. 54; Raven (2005) p. 60; Brown (2004) p. 85; Sellar (2000) p. 210; McDonald (1997) pp. 130, 136, 189; McDonald (1995) p. 143, 143 n. 69; Young (1990) p. 22; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 283 n. 12; Barrow (1981) p. 119; Barrow (1973) p. 380; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 216; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 424; Rymer; Sanderson (1816) p. 638; Document 4/42/5 (n.d.). The inclusion of Ail√©an, and two of his Clann Somhairle kinsmen‚Äîthe aforesaid Alasdair and Aonghus M√≥r‚Äîfurther illustrates the kindred's incorporation within the Scottish realm.Holton (2017) p. 146; McDonald (2006) p. 77; Smith (1998); McDonald (1997) p. 136. Now-ruinous Castle Tioram may well have been a Clann Ruaidhr√≠ stronghold.Oram (2008) p. 182; Tabraham (2005) pp. 29, 111; McNeill (2002) p. 154; Homann (2001) p. 245. The island the fortress sits upon is first recorded in a charter of Ail√©an's daughter, Cairist√≠ona.Stell (2014) p. 273; Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; Fisher (2005) p. 91; Raven (2005) p. 63; McDonald (1997) pp. 189‚Äì190 n. 120; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.). According to early modern tradition, the castle was erected by his granddaughter, √Åine Nic Ruaidhr√≠ in the fourteenth century.Stell (2014) pp. 273‚Äì274; Macphail (1914) p. 26. The castle served as the seat of the latter's Clann Domhnaill descendants the next four hundred years.Fisher (2005) p. 91. Although it is possible that Dubhghall's power base had been located in GarmoranSellar (2000) p. 206; Cowan (1990) p. 115. and perhaps Uist, there is uncertainty as to how and when these territories entered into the possession of his family.Raven (2005) pp. 56‚Äì58; Rixson (2001) p. 86. Later leading members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ certainly possessed them, but evidence of custody before the mid thirteenth century is lacking.Ross (2012) pp. 3‚Äì4; Raven (2005) pp. 56‚Äì58. In theory, these territories could have been awarded to the kindred following the Scots' acquisition of the Isles in 1266.Ross (2012) p. 3; Raven (2005) p. 57. On the other hand, the family's position in the Isles may have stemmed from its marital alliance with the Crovan dynasty, an affiliation undertaken at some point before Ruaidhr√≠'s apparent expulsion from Kintyre.Raven (2005) pp. 57‚Äì58; Woolf (2003) p. 178. If the family indeed acquired Uist after the events of 1266, it could cast further light on Ail√©an's part in the quelling of the aforesaid Manx revolt.Raven (2005) p. 60. Whatever the case, Ail√©an is not accorded any title in contemporary sources.Raven (2005) p. 59. An inventory of parliamentary documents from 1282 reveals that the Scottish Crown received a letter from the Norwegian king concerning the lands of Uist and Eigg.

Metro Center is the original colonial settlement of Springfield, Massachusetts, located beside a bend in the Connecticut River. As of 2019, Metro Center features a majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural, business, and civic venues.Zimmerman/Volk Associates, Residential Market Potential, Downtown Springfield, for City of Springfield, December 2006 Metro Center includes Springfield's Central Business District, its Club Quarter, its government center, its convention headquarters, and in recent years, it has become an increasingly popular residential district, especially among young professionals, empty-nesters, and creative types, with a population of approximately 7,000 (2010.) Metro Center is physically separated from the Connecticut River by Interstate 91 ‚Äì a 1958 urban renewal project that separated the city from its riverfront.City of Springfield, Mass.: Metro Center . Springfieldcityhall.com (2010-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-21. Early history It is difficult to estimate the origins of human habitation in the Connecticut River Valley, but there are physical signs dating back at least 9,000 years. Various sites indicate millennia of fishing, horticulture, beaver-hunting, and burials. The region was inhabited by several Algonkian- speaking Native American communities, culturally connected but distinguished by the place names they assigned to their respective communities: Agawam (low land), Woronco (in a circular way), Nonotuck (in the midst of the river), Pocumtuck (narrow, swift river), and Sokoki (separated from their neighbors). The modern-day Springfield metropolitan area was inhabited by the Agawam Indians. The Agawam, as well as other groups, belong to the larger cultural category of Alongkian Indians. In 1634, a devastating plague, probably smallpox, reduced the Native American population of the Connecticut River Valley to a tiny percentage of its previous size. Governor Bradford of Massachusetts writes that in Windsor (notably the site of a trade post, where European diseases often spread to Native populations), \\"of 1,000 of [the Indians] 150 of them died.\\" With so many dead, \\"rot[ting] above ground for want of burial,\\" British colonists were emboldened to attempt significant settlement of the region. Metro Center, purchased from the Native people of Agawam in 1636 by William Pynchon and a group of pioneers, was originally called Agawam Plantation. Eighteen Agawam Indians signed on to the deed, which was witnessed and negotiated with the help of a translator from the East named Ahaughton. At the time of its founding, Agawam Plantation was the northernmost settlement on the Connecticut River, and belonged to the Connecticut Colony as opposed to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to which it would later belong. Within less than a decade after its founding in 1636, differences arose between the leaders of Agawam (Springfield) and Newtown (Hartford) over how to relate with the region's Native population. Springfield hoped to pursue peaceful relations with the Natives so as to better facilitate trade and communal farming, whereas Hartford ‚Äì and many of Connecticut's early settlers ‚Äì had fought the bloody Pequot War to claim their territory, and thus took a more militant view. This difference of opinion led to Agawam (Springfield) annexing itself to Massachusetts in 1640. At that time, William Pynchon was named magistrate of the settlement, and the town's name was changed to Springfield in Pynchon's honor. (Pynchon was from Springfield, Essex.) Metro Center Springfield was founded on the Connecticut River, just north of the River's first falls unnavigable by seagoing vessels, (the Enfield Falls.) Thus, in founding Springfield, the business-minded Pynchon assured that all northern river trade and travel ran through Springfield. In early colonial days, Springfield was the dominant trading post on the Connecticut River. Pynchon and the English profited immensely from fur trade with the Agawam Indians, but also used a variety of tactics - from debt to alcohol - to take more and more land until the Agawam people were contained to a walled village atop Long Hill. This was a rapid cycle: Native people relied on trading seasonal goods such as furs, so they took out mortgages with land as collateral. The demand for furs led to overhunting, which forced Native people to default and for the English to take more Native land. Having lost their fields, the need for/overexploitation of the fur trade continued. In 1675, during King Philip's War. the people of Western Massachusetts resorted to extraordinary measures, including the taking of arms and hostages, to weaken and preclude a threat from Native people. However, the Agawams and others still attempted the Attack on Springfield, which burned over 75% of Springfield, which was only Metro Center, including the saw and grist mills. Following the war, thought was given to abandoning the settlement entirely. In 1777, noting Springfield's location on a major U.S. river, fertile farmland, and close proximity to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, George Washington and Henry Knox founded the U.S. National Arsenal at Springfield on a tall bluff overlooking Metro Center. Subsequently, Springfield developed neighborhoods other than Metro Center. In 1813, the green in the middle of Metro Center was officially named Court Square. Court Square had been the center of public and social life since the times when Native Americans roamed freely through Springfield's streets (pre-King Philip's War,) and continued to be so until the building of Springfield's first train station in the 1830s. The arrival of the railroad to Springfield in the 1830s brought great wealth to the city, again, due to its location. Goods from New York, Boston, Chicago, and even as far west as San Francisco travelled through Springfield on their ways to coastal distribution centers. Springfield, rather than Hartford, or Northampton, or Greenfield, became Western New England's railroad hub, perhaps due to the presence of the Springfield Armory, but more likely due to the city's growing reputation for ingenuity, and that it served as a nearly equidistant point between Albany and Boston, Providence, and New York. Culture Metro Center features the majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural institutions. For example, it features the Springfield Armory National Park, which includes a museum featuring the world's largest historic firearm collection.Springfield Armory National Historic Site ‚Äì Springfield Armory National Historic Site.

The Quadrangle features the George Walter Vincent Smith Museum, which is known worldwide for having the largest collection of Chinese cloisonn√© outside of China. It also features the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a particularly strong European Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection, including paintings by Monet, Degas, and Gauguin, among others. The American Collection features works by Springfielder James McNeill Whistler. The Springfield Science Museum features the first-ever American planetarium (built 1937,) Dinosaur Hall, and a live animal center.

As of 2011, Springfield's Club Quarter continues to expand, now featuring over 70 clubs, bars, restaurants, and even historic gathering places such as Smith's Billiards, The Student Prince, both extant since the early 20th century. For an example of the latter, the Duryea brothers built the first American gasoline-powered car at a still existent building on Taylor Street ‚Äì one of the few buildings in the district at that time, which was not a bar or club.

In Springfield's Club Quarter, many different \\"scenes\\" co-mingle peaceably, including hip-hop, rock, LGBT, jazz, strip clubs for both men and women, and blues. The restaurants and clubs by the Basketball Hall of Fame also feature live music (Pizzeria Uno's, Mama Iguana's,) Las Vegas-style shows (Pazzo's,) and of course, several sports bars, such as Samuel's and Max's Tavern. Urban fabric Even by urban New England standards, where downtowns are frequently walkable like those in Europe, Springfield's is exceptionally so. It is composed of mixed-use residential, commercial, and institutional organizations. A majority of its buildings were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, giving it a Victorian look; however, there are numerous skyscrapers as well. Metro Center is cut off from the Connecticut Riverfront by Interstate 91, an 8-lane highway. Across Interstate 91 sits the Basketball Hall of Fame complex, Springfield's largest tourist draw. =Legislature skyline height limit= From 1908 until 1971, Springfield was subject to a skyline height limit ‚Äì imposed by the Massachusetts State Legislature ‚Äì of 125 feet, and thus Springfield has a relatively lower skyline than comparable cities of its population and economic and cultural importance.

This convenience, however, came at a steep price to Springfielders: hasty, poor urban planning decisions during 1958 created the now elevated I-91 viaduct along the Connecticut River, which essentially cut off Springfield from the Connecticut, the parks surrounding it, and the Basketball Hall of Fame complex, preventing foot traffic and resulting in untold losses of tourist dollars among other losses.http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context;=larp_grad_research&sei- redir;=1#search=\\"91+north+end+umass+cut+off\\"http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/1200_Hall_of_Fame_Building_Plans/Springfield_TAP_Presentation_FINAL_diagrams.pdf In 2010, Boston's Urban Land Institute proposed a vision for Springfield's riverfront; however, as of 2011, Interstate 91 remains a physical barrier between Springfield, the Connecticut River, and the Basketball Hall of Fame.City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront .

The hospital was created by the Australian obstetrician and gynaecologists Catherine Hamlin and her husband Reginald Hamlin to care for women with childbirth injuries and has been in operation since 1974. It is in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. It is the only hospital of its kind in the world dedicated exclusively to women with obstetric fistula (a condition common in the developing world where the maternal health provisions are poor), and it treats all patients free of charge. Patients undergo surgical repair by Ethiopian and expatriate surgeons trained at the hospital's main facility in Addis Ababa. Around 93% of these patients are repaired successfully. In addition to the main hospital in Ethiopia's capital, Dr. Hamlin has opened five hospitals in the Ethiopian cities of Bahir Dar, Mekele, Yirgalem, Harrar and Metu. All 6 hospitals provide a safe birthing facility where former patients who fall pregnant can have a caesarian section. The hospital is a global centre of expertise in fistula repair, and it trains surgeons from around the world with 28 surgeons trained between 2015‚Äì2018. Hamlin says that they have \\"now treated 55,000 [women] and these are like ambassadors all over the countryside\\". Patients come to hear of the hospital primarily by word of mouth. In 2008, when the fourth clinic was opened Dr Hamlin travelled the world to raise awareness of the effect of the condition on women in Ethiopia. The hospitals aim to cure 4000 women annually, but Hamlin cited the World Health Organisation's estimate that there are 6000-7000 cases a year in Ethiopia alone., Right Livelihood Award, 2009 Since its inception visitors and supporters from all over the world have visited the hospital to see the patients and the work of the hospital. Many of them have gone on to become fundraisers for the organisation so all the patients receive free treatment. The Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation (formerly the Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia (Australia)) was established in Australia to support the work of the fistula hospitals and eradicate obstetric fistula. Founding In 1958, Catherine and Reginald Hamlin answered an advertisement in The Lancet for an obstetrician and gynaecologist to establish a midwifery school at the Princess Tsehay Hospital in Addis Ababa. They arrived in Addis Ababa in 1959 on a three-year contract with the Ethiopian government but only about 10 midwives had been trained before the government closed the midwifery school. The Hamlins had never seen an obstetric fistula before and, seeing many cases arrive at the school, decided to create a dedicated hospital. Obstetric fistula was virtually eradicated in the developed world by the 20th century due to improved obstetric techniques such as Caesarean section. According to UNFPA in Ethiopia 353 mothers die for every 100,000 births, in Uganda it is 343 an in Australia it is 6. The Hamlins resorted to studying the works of earlier fistula surgeons such as Dr. J. Marion Sims (the father of modern gynaecology) and from doctors who were operating in places such as Egypt. The Hamlins refined the surgical technique to close an obstetric fistula while continuing to treat a broad range of obstetric cases. Word of mouth is the primary method of patients discovering the hospital, going from 30 patients in the first year to 300 patients in the second. Offered treatments include physiotherapy, stress incontinence management, specific treatment for stoma patients, psychological counselling, extended medical care and general education. About 55,000 patients have been treated to repair the internal damage from obstetric fistula. Development In 1998, the hospital was extensively refurbished and enlarged. Today Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital can accommodate up to 140 patients and four operations can be performed simultaneously in the theatre. Five fistula centres have been established in the regional towns of Bahir Dar, Mekelle, Harar and Yirgalem and Metu and the Hamlin Fistula hospitals are staffed by over 550 Ethiopians. The growing network of Hamlin Fistula Hospitals and the midwifery college are supported largely by private donors in Australia, the UK and the United States. The largest of the dedicated support organisations is the Fistula Foundation, located in San Jose, California. Money is also provided by World Vision, the Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation, the England-based Ethiopiaid and funds paid into an endowment by the Australian Government. The Hamlin College of Midwives was established to ensure that there is a skilled birth attendant available to provide maternal health care (pre-, intro- and post- natal). Dr Hamlin believes that midwifery is the answer to the problem. In 2006 she established a school of midwifery with the aim of putting a trained midwife in every village in Ethiopia. The college follows the curriculum of the International Confederation of midwives, including the precondition that students conduct at least 40 deliveries before they graduate. The Midwifery college is on land adjacent to Desta Mender (\\"Village of Joy\\"), where women with long-term injuries caused by obstructed labour reside, about 17 km from Addis Ababa. The first students graduated in 2011 and, as of 2018, 125 midwives have graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Midwifery. All have committed to working as a Hamlin midwife for a minimum of 4 years. The midwives are being deployed in pairs near medical centres. There are currently (2018) 48 Hamlin Midwifery clinics in rural health centres staffed by Hamlin midwives. In 2017 Hamlin midwives delivered over 22,500 babies and no cases of fistula occurred in these births. Due to the development of the five regional Hamlin Fistula Centers, some of the women who suffer the long-term effects of obstetric fistula are able to move back to their homes and receive ongoing medical care from one of the outreach centres. Additionally, some women have established small, successful businesses that have enabled them to move out of Desta Mender to nearby towns and return to receive medical care or visit friends. Oprah Winfrey Show In January 2004, Catherine Hamlin appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the 50 years of free reconstructive surgery that she has been providing to over 25,000 patients. After Hamlin's visit to the show, thousands of viewers were compelled to act due to her sheer selflessness. The Fistula Foundation, which supports Dr. Hamlin's hospital, received more than $3 million in donations. Oprah Winfrey was so impressed by Dr. Hamlin's actions that she visited the hospital in Ethiopia to tape the second episode in December 2005. The funding received by the hospital following this exposure led to the building a brand new facility with classrooms, examination rooms, housing for residents who travel to the hospital for treatment and a small apartment for the on-call doctors for Desta Mender.

Given a commutative A-algebra, C, and a nilpotent ideal N\\\\subseteq C, any A-algebra homomorphism B\\\\to C/N may be lifted to an A-algebra map B \\\\to C. If moreover any such lifting is unique, then f is said to be formally √©tale. Formally smooth maps were defined by Alexander Grothendieck in √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique IV. For finitely presented morphisms, formal smoothness is equivalent to usual notion of smoothness.  Examples = Smooth morphisms  All smooth morphisms f:X\\\\to S are equivalent to morphisms locally of finite presentation which are formally smooth. Hence formal smoothness is a slight generalization of smooth morphisms.  Non-example  One method for detecting formal smoothness of a scheme is using infinitesimal lifting criterion. For example, using the truncation morphism k[t]/(t^3) \\\\to k[t]/(t^2) the infinitesimal lifting criterion can be described using the commutative square > \\\\begin{matrix} X & \\\\leftarrow & \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left(\\\\frac{k[x]}{(x^2)}\\\\right) > \\\\ \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow \\\\ S & \\\\leftarrow & > \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left(\\\\frac{k[x]}{(x^3)}\\\\right) \\\\end{matrix} where X,S \\\\in Sch/S. For example, if > X = \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{k[x,y]}{(xy)} \\\\right) and Y = \\\\text{Spec}(k) then consider the tangent vector at the origin (0,0) \\\\in X(k) given by the ring morphism > \\\\frac{k[x,y]}{(xy)} \\\\to \\\\frac{k[t]}{(t^2)} sending > \\\\begin{align} x &\\\\mapsto \\\\varepsilon \\\\ y &\\\\mapsto \\\\varepsilon \\\\end{align} Note because xy \\\\mapsto \\\\varepsilon^2 = 0, this is a valid morphism of commutative rings. Then, since a lifting of this morphism to > \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left(\\\\frac{k[t]}{(t^3)}\\\\right) \\\\to X is of the form > \\\\begin{align} x &\\\\mapsto \\\\varepsilon + a\\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\ y &\\\\mapsto > \\\\varepsilon + b\\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\end{align} and xy \\\\mapsto \\\\varepsilon^2 + (a+b)\\\\varepsilon^3= \\\\varepsilon^2, there cannot be an infinitesimal lift since this is non-zero, hence X \\\\in Sch/k is not formally smooth. This also proves this morphism is not smooth from the equivalence between formally smooth morphisms locally of finite presentation and smooth morphisms.

Charity work Loomba has become well known for his fundraising and campaigning concerning the issue of widowhood in the developing world. His mother, Shrimati Pushpa Wati Loomba, was widowed at the age of 37 in India, and Loomba experienced first-hand the social and economic discrimination that widows in that country faced. It was in his mother‚Äôs memory that Loomba set up his charity, The Loomba Foundation, which works to raise awareness of the issue of widowhood and which raises funds to educate the children of poor widows in India and empower widows in other developing countries in south Asia and across Africa. The flagship of the charity‚Äôs awareness campaign is International Widows Day, which takes place annually on 23 June, the anniversary of his mother‚Äôs widowhood. Following a sustained campaign, on 21 December 2010 the United Nations General Assembly formally recognised, by unanimous acclaim, 23 June as International Widows Day.

The series, based on 19th Century Europe, features many elements of fairy tales, notably the tales of the German Brothers Grimm. In future novels, Funke plans to include fairy tales from other cultures such as Spain, France and Russia. Mirrorworld is Cornelia Funke's first series of novels in which she has collaborated with another person; this is because, whilst working on a script idea with Lionel Wingram, they both \\"discovered\\" the story. Funke loved the idea so much she asked Wingram if she could turn it into a novel; he agreed, but requested that he be involved in the creative process.http://www.hookedonbookz.com/2011/01/abookaholic-interviews-cornelia- funke.html After deciding to work on the series, it took Funke three years to write the first novel, Reckless, due to another novel she was writing at the time.

He suffered for his support of the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. He was also a man of arts and sciences, and developed plantsmanship, devised medical apparatus and carried out scientific experiments on coffee and tobacco. Early life Rumsey was born at Llanover, in Monmouthshire, the son of Walter Rumsey of Usk.\\"The diary of Walter Powell of Llantilio Crossenny\\" He was admitted to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, at the age of 16, James Cornelius Morrice. Wales in the seventeenth century : its literature and men of letters and action where he studied under Francis Bacon and William Harvey.Bennett Alan Weinberg, Bonnie K. Bealer \\"The world of caffeine: the science and culture of the world's most popular drug\\" He then went to Gray's Inn, where he was made Barrister, Puncher, and Lent Reader. In 1635 he was appointed Puisne Judge in the Brecon Circuit, and in 1637 he became Chief Justice. He was so eminent in his profession that he was called \\"the picklock of the Law.\\" Career In April 1640, Rumsey was elected Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire in the Short Parliament. He refused to serve in the Long Parliament and in 1645 was removed by parliament from his position as second justice on the Brecknock circuit. In addition to the law, Rumsy was interested in philosophy, science and music. Wood described him as a good musician who played the organ and lute and was a composer. Of his plantsmanship Wood wrote \\"He was an ingeniose man, and had a philosophicall head; he was most curious for grafting, inoculating, and planting, and ponds. If he had any old dead plumbe-tree, or apple-tree, he lett them stand, and planted vines at the bottome, and lett them climbe up, and they would beare very well.\\" Thomas Hearne, John Aubrey Letters written by eminent persons in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Inventions Rumsey invented the probang, a medical instrument made of whalebone, to cleanse the throat and stomach which was described in his work called Organon Salutis: an instrument to cleanse the stomach in 1657.The Coffee Houses of Old London Wood wrote \\"He was much troubled with flegme, and being so one winter at the court at Ludlowe (where he was one of the counsellours), sitting by the fire, spitting and spewling, he tooke a fine tender sprig, and tied a ragge at the end, and conceived he might putt it downe his throate, and fetch up the flegme, and he did so. Afterwards he made this instrument of whale-bone. I have oftentimes seen him use it. I could never make it goe downe my throate, but for those that can 'tis a most incomparable engine. If troubled with the wind it cures you immediately. It makes you vomit without any paine, and besides, the vomits of apothecaries have aliquid vetietii in them.\\" Rumsey was interested in the medical uses of coffee and in his Electuary of Cophy, which appeared in 1657 he gave a prescription for \\"a new and superior way of preparing coffee\\" as an Electuray to take when using the provang. > \\"Take equal quantity of Butter and Sallet-oyle, melt them well together, but > not boyle them: Then stirre them well that they may incorporate together: > Then melt therewith three times as much Honey, and stirre it well together: > Then add thereunto powder of Turkish Cophie, to make it a thick Electuary\\". He also devised a concoction called \\"wash-brew\\" which included oatmeal, powder of \\"cophie\\", a pint of ale or any wine, ginger, honey, or sugar to please the taste, to which could be added butter and any cordial powder or pleasant spice. The mixture was to bekept in a flannel bag for use when required. This said to be a popular medicine among the Welsh people. Rumsey wrote another work, Divers new experiments of the virtue of Tobacco and Coffee to which Sir Henry Blount and James Howell wrote commendatory Epistles. In a chapter entitled \\"Experiments of Cophee\\" he noted that coffee had the power to cure drunkards. Marriage and later life Rumsey married Barbara Pritchard, daughter of Martha Pritchard Llanover. On the Restoration, Rumsey was proposed for the intended order of Knights of the Royal Oak.

It was set up in 1973, following the publication the previous year of a report entitled Study of Potential Benefits to British Industry from Offshore Oil and Gas Developments (the IMEG Report). The primary aim was to raise British industrial participation in North Sea expenditure from an assumed 30% to a target 70%. The principal mechanism was the so-called 'Full and Fair Opportunity' policy aimed at ensuring British-based suppliers (whether or not locally owned) could compete on equal terms with foreign firms. OSO also promoted the establishment of new British-based suppliers, including encouraging inward investment and joint ventures between British and foreign firms. Later, it became involved in R&D; support and export promotion. On the basis of its own calculations, OSO rapidly reached and then substantially exceeded its 70% UK content target. However, its statistics were the subject of considerable criticism. By the late 1980s, the increasing maturity of the North Sea, changes in oil company procurement practices and pressure from the European Commission were all impacting negatively on OSO operations. In preparation for the introduction of the European Single Market, in 1992 OSO abandoned the 'Full and Fair Opportunity' policy and the collection of UK content statistics, leaving it to concentrate on export promotion and R&D; support. First as an independent entity with a remit expanded to include the downstream oil and gas and petrochemicals sectors and later as a 'brand' within the Infrastructure and Energy Projects Directorate of the Department of Trade and Industry, OSO survived until 1999. OSO‚Äôs flagship policy of seeking to increase the local content in the expenditure of oil and gas companies operating within a given national jurisdiction was soon widely imitated and subsequently also adopted in respect of other resource-based industries and even beyond. In some cases, governments have imposed a formal requirement for companies to achieve a specific local content percentage by value, in marked contrast to OSO‚Äôs practice of aiming at an overall non-binding industry target.

Funerary monument to Benedict XI. San Domenico is a Roman Catholic basilica church, located on Piazza Giordano Bruno and via del Castellano in the city of Perugia, region of Umbria, central Italy. Description A church, titled the Pieve di Santo Stefano del Castellare, was present at the site since about the 5th century. Construction of the precursor to the present church, also known as San Domenico Vecchio, began in 1304, and was constructed over the pre-existing church which had become inadequate after the growth of the Dominican Order. According to Giorgio Vasari, it was designed by Giovanni Pisano That church was consecrated in 1459, and had a layout that resembled the northern-European Hallenkirche plans. By 1614‚Äì1615, the San Domenico Vecchio church was dilapidated, showing structural problems, and threatening collapse. New plans for refurbishment were implemented. The church fa√ßade retains a late 16th-century portal and is now double Baroque staircase. The interior was renovated in 1629‚Äì1632 by Carlo Maderno, and shows similarities with Maderno's design of the nave of St Peter's in Rome, except San Domenico has small lateral windows. Of the prior San Domenico church, some fragments remain: the cloister (1455‚Äì1579), the chapel of St Catherine, and a large Gothic rose window (21 x 8.5 m) near the choir, executed by Bartolomeo di Pietro and Mariotto di Nardo in 1411. This window is also shown in a fresco now in the Palazzo dei Priori of Perugia. The bell tower was built in 1454‚Äì1500 by the Lombard architect Gasperino di Antonio. Originally it was taller than its current appearance,Francesca Abbozzo, Il complesso di San Domenico a Perugia. but it was later reduced for stability reasons. Over the centuries, some of the movable artwork inside the church was removed. It still contains the 14th-century funerary monument to Pope Benedict XI, who died at Perugia in 1304 (perhaps sculpted by a pupil of Arnolfo di Cambio). It still has the altar (1459) of the Chapel of the Rosary by Agostino di Duccio and wooden choir-stalls, dating to the late 14th century. The church once housed also the Perugia Altarpiece (Guidalotti Polyptych) by Fra Angelico, now in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria. The Chapel of St Catherine has 14th and 15th-century frescoes. The annexed cloister houses the National Archaeological Museum of Umbria, with pre- historic, Roman and Etruscan items excavated in Umbria.Comune of Perugia, tourism office.

The election of Oppedisano had not been easy. Giuseppe Pelle aspired to replace his ailing father Antonio Gambazza Pelle as capo crimine and keep the title in San Luca at the risk of triggering a conflict between clans. However, Vincenzo Pesce felt that the nomination of Pelle would distort the equilibrium in the 'Ndrangheta and threatened to form a separate organization taking some 30 locali ‚Äì local 'Ndrangheta organisations ‚Äì with him. As a result, Oppedisano became the capo crimine instead of Pelle.

History The painting was executed for the St. Nicholas Chapel in the Basilica of San Domenico, Perugia. In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the Pinacoteca Vaticana. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The polyptych also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two tondoes with the Annunciation Angel and the Annunciation, in the cusps. Side panel depicting St. Dominic, by Fra Angelico Description The work includes a large central panel, depicting the Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels, which was fully painted by Fra Angelico. The two side panels, each forming two arched sub-panels and including a figure of saint. On the left are St. Dominic and St. Nicholas, attributed to Angelico, while on the right are St. John the Baptist and St. Catherine of Alexandria, considered to be mostly by his workshop. The central Madonna is a Maest√† depiction, and sits on a large throne painted using geometric perspective. In front of her is a step with vases housing three white and red roses (symbolic of the Virgin's purity and a forecast of Christ's Passion, respectively). The panel resembles that in the Cortona Triptych, especially for the Madonna, the throne's arch and the placement of the angels. The pavement is decorated with marble tarsia, already used by Fra Angelico in earlier works such as the San Pietro Martire Triptych (1428‚Äì1429). The saint's figures are less monumental than in the later Tabernacle of the Lanaioli (1433‚Äì1435). Behind them is a table, covered by a brocade drape decorated in gold, over which is St. Nicholas' mitre. The predella panels portray scenes of the Life of St. Nicholas.

The cedar glade is an endangered habitat type that now exists as remnants within stretches of degraded or improperly managed territory. Historically, the glades were maintained naturally as open areas in otherwise brushy woodlands, with disturbances such as wildfire or the activity of bison preventing the succession of woody vegetation into the open areas. The plants are adapted to habitat that is disturbed, so they can sometimes be found growing in artificially disturbed areas such as roadsides, cultivated fields, and pastures grazed by cattle. There are only a few populations of the plant remaining, and these are persisting in small stretches of land that are no longer part of the original pristine cedar glade ecosystem, or are in cedar glades that are degrading in quality. Only one population is considered to be thriving due to appropriate management.

Economic conditions had changed drastically by 1868 when the horse-drawn streetcars of the Springfield Street Railway first started to run on State Street, to the south of what became the McKnight District. History Primus P. Mason, donated Mason Square to the city for public use, and sold considerable land to the McKnight Brothers, which became their eponymous neighborhood In 1870, a group of business people led by brothers William and John McKnight planned the McKnight District as a residential community; most of it was constructed between 1870 and 1900.

The neighborhood's 900 ornate homes are part of a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of its western half is also a local historic district with homes lovingly restored and preserved by residents.http://choosespringfieldmass.com/city_neighborhoods/mcknight_01109.html Several small decorative open spaces were built by the original developers of the community and still grace the neighborhood. These include the \\"Dingle\\", or McKnight Glen, the Thompson Triangle, three smaller triangles along Bay Street, and the decorative Dartmouth Terrace leading to the McKnight Glen from Thompson Triangle. To the west of the McKnight Section are the Springfield Armory, a portion of which has been preserved as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, and the Springfield Technical Community College and Springfield's Downtown. I-291 skirts its northern edge, providing easy access to McKnight. Mason Square, named for philanthropist Primus P. Mason and formerly known as Winchester Square after Mayor Charles A. Winchester, is the commercial heart of the McKnight District. It features a renovated (as of 2011) branch library, the original Indian Motorcycle Company building, American International College, and a monument to the first game of basketball placed on the site of the first-ever game, played at the original location of Springfield College. The area acquired its name from the donation of its land specifically for public use by Mr. Mason, whose fortune stemmed not only from his time as a prospector in California but also for his sale of land to the McKnight Brothers for their developments.

The was the raid's main target, though anti-aircraft positions and other warships at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal were also attacked. Other U.S. Navy and Royal Navy aircraft struck airfields in the Tokyo area. While Nagato was only lightly damaged, the American aircraft sank a destroyer, a submarine and two escort vessels and damaged five small vessels. The Allied pilots also claimed the destruction of several locomotives and 43 Japanese aircraft as well as damage to another 77 aircraft. Japanese anti-aircraft guns shot down twelve American and two British aircraft. Background During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, which was led by Admiral William Halsey, conducted a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's striking force, Task Force 38 (TF 38), which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain and included nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts.Morison (1960), p. 310Tillman (2010), p. 199 Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers.Frank (1999), p. 157 On 10 July TF 38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air.Royal Navy (1995), p. 218 No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large-scale suicide attacks on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945.Tillman (2010), p. 201 Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15 July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground.Morison (1960), pp. 311‚Äì314 The American warships then sailed south and on 16 July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's (BPF's) main striking force, which was designated Task Force 37 (TF 37), and comprised three aircraft carriers and their escorts.Royal Navy (1995), pp. 219‚Äì220 Part of Yokosuka Naval Arsenal photographed during the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) remaining large warships were unable to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines.Tillman (2010), p. 208 While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay.Tully (2003), \\"Nagato's Last Year: July 1945 ‚Äì July 1946\\" At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No. 7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer was also docked nearby in a position where she was able to protect the battleship with her 25 mm anti-aircraft guns. Nagatos presence at Yokosuka was revealed to the Allies by photographs taken during the 10 July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16 July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF 37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink the remnants of the IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.Hoyt (1982), p. 48Tillman (2010), p. 210 Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited. Attack A U.S. Navy reconnaissance photograph of Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 18 July 1945. Nagato is located at the upper left of the photo. On 17 July the American and British fleet attempted to strike the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and other targets in the Tokyo area. While two waves of aircraft were dispatched, the attack was frustrated by heavy cloud over the region and further attacks were canceled. The aircraft which reached the Tokyo area struck airfields north of the city and caused little damage.Hoyt (1982), p. 54Royal Navy (1995), p. 220 While the naval base was not attacked, it was overflown by an American fighter and its defenders were readied to respond to attacks. On the night of 17‚Äì18 July American and British warships bombarded the city of Hitachi.Morison (1960), pp. 314‚Äì316 The next day, the Allied fleet sailed south looking for weather which was better suited to conducting flight operations. Conditions improved during the morning, and at 11:30 am the day's air strikes began to launch. The British aircraft of TF 37 were dispatched against airfields in the Tokyo area. The size of this attack was considerably reduced from what was planned, however, as the fuel system on board had become contaminated with water and the carrier could only launch six Vought F4U Corsair fighters.Royal Navy (1995), p. 221 TF 38's main effort was directed against Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, with Nagato being designated the raid's primary target. A smaller number of American aircraft were also dispatched to raid Japanese air fields.Hoyt (1982), p. 55 The attack on Yokosuka began at about 3:30 pm on 18 July. The first wave of American aircraft attacked the anti-aircraft batteries around the naval base, and succeeded in neutralizing them. Following this, the aircraft of VF-88 attacked Nagato with bombs.Morison (1960), p. 316 A 500-pound general-purpose bomb struck the battleship's bridge, killing her commanding officer, Rear Admiral Otsuka Miki as well as the executive officer and at least nine other men. Another 500 pound bomb later struck Nagato and detonated near her officer's mess, killing about 22 sailors and knocking out four 25 mm guns. The only other direct hit on the ship was made by a shell or rocket which did not explode. In addition, 60 bombs landed in the harbor near Nagato, causing breaches to her double hull which let 2,000 tons of water into the ship. By the time the attack concluded at 4:10 pm, 35 of the battleship's 967 officers and men had been killed. The overall damage to the ship was later assessed as being light. American aircraft also attacked several other ships docked at Yokosuka. The unfinished Yaezakura broke in two and sank after being bombed, and the submarine was destroyed by another bomb; at the time the submarine's crew was ashore and did not suffer any fatalities. Two escort vessels and a torpedo boat were also sunk. In addition to these losses, five other ships, including the obsolete destroyer and training ships and , were damaged. Despite their proximity to Nagato, Fukugawa Maru No. 7 and Ushio were not damaged. The British and United States aircraft dispatched against airfields claimed to have destroyed 43 Japanese aircraft and damaged another 77. The pilots of these aircraft also claimed the destruction of several railway locomotives. Allied losses in the attacks made on 18 July were 12 U.S. Navy aircraft, two Royal Navy aircraft and 18 aircrew. The Allied pilots were disappointed they had not sunk Nagato. Aftermath Royal Australian Navy personnel inspecting a wrecked submarine and a wrecked ship at Yokosuka during September 1945 Following its attacks on the Tokyo Bay area on 18 July, the Allied fleet sailed away from Japan to be refueled. Its next attacks were made against the main body of the IJN in Kure and the Inland Sea on 24, 25 and 28 July.Royal Navy (1995), pp. 221‚Äì222 These raids sank three battleships, an aircraft carrier and several other warships but cost the Allies 133 aircraft and 102 aircrew killed.Halsey (1947), p. 265 The Third Fleet and elements of the BPF continued strikes against targets in Japan until the end of the war on 15 August 1945.Morison (1960), pp. 331‚Äì335 After the attack on Yokosuka, the Nagatos crew removed all casualties from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's ballast tanks were also flooded to give the impression that she had been sunk. During the early hours of 2 August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to be false. On 30 August the ship was surrendered to the U.S. Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28 July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 29‚Äì30 July.

The International WaterCentre was also named in the opening paper of the January 2010 issue of Freshwater Biology as one of the institutions (alongside The Nature Conservancy, World Water Forum and the World Bank) whose training programs represented the \\"most workable approach\\" to \\"educate a new generation of water scientists and policy makers\\".  History  Key dates of the International WaterCentre * The International WaterCentre was established in 2005 through a joint venture between four universities: The University of Queensland, Griffith University, Monash University and the University of Western Australia. The partners came together to focus on leadership and capacity building in the area of Integrated Water Management. * In 2005, former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie announced a 2.4 million dollar funding boost to the organisation, declaring water management as one of the ‚Äúgreatest challenges of the 21st century‚Äù. * In 2008, International WaterCentre CEO Mark Pascoe was awarded the annual Medal for Management Innovation by the Australian Institute of Management. * In 2017, International WaterCentre announced that it will become an independent entity of Griffith University.  Activities =Education The International WaterCentre provides a number of education and training programs through its member universities based in Australia and South Africa. = Postgraduate education = The International WaterCentre‚Äôs flagship program is the ‚ÄòMaster of Integrated Water Management‚Äô. It is a co-badged and co-taught degree between The University of Queensland, Monash University, Griffith University and The University of Western Australia. Commenting on the programs formation, Premier Beattie stated, \\"Not only will these courses help build local skills in water management, they will also further boost Queensland's international reputation for high quality education.\\" Every year the International WaterCentre awards a small number of scholarships to candidates who are accepted into the IWC ‚ÄòMaster of Integrated Water Management‚Äô and demonstrate potential to become leaders in water management. International students make up a large portion of the student body. = Training programs = The International WaterCentre offers a number of non-award training programs, including the IWC Water Leadership Program and tailored training programs for senior water industry professionals. One such program is the government supported Water Sensitive Cities Workshop series, which brought Australian water professionals together to discern major environmental issues and assess progress in creating water-sensitive cities around the country.  Research  Through collaboration with government and its partner universities, the International WaterCentre conducts research on water-related issues and regularly publishes to scientific journals on the subject. International WaterCentre research themes are: Integrated water management, water sensitive cities, healthy rivers and aquatic ecosystems, water, sanitation and hygiene, and policy-science integration. In 2007, the IWC established a research and education node in Johannesburg, South Africa, to focus on water challenges through collaboration with local experts. The node has three main functions, # Research ‚Äì Examining specific issues of concern in ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù Africa. # Education ‚Äì Advanced postgraduate study on these issues. # Community engagement ‚Äì Create a more sustainable future in water management involving the community. = Asia-Pacific knowledge hub = In 2009 the International WaterCentre was selected to join the ‚ÄòAsia-Pacific Knowledge Hubs‚Äô as the Hub for Healthy Rivers and Aquatic Ecosystems. The Asia-Pacific Water Forum‚Äôs ‚ÄúKnowledgeHubs‚Äù network is designed to improve water security in the Asia- Pacific region through the sharing of knowledge, skills and experience among recognised institutions. The hub focuses on a number of key areas including: generating best practice information on protection of rivers, providing training and postgraduate courses in integrated water management, developing river health monitoring framework and others.  Services  Since operations began in 2005, The International WaterCentre has provided services in integrated water management to governments and industry throughout Australia and internationally. Headed by the University of Queensland, the company facilitated the Queensland Water Commission's Expert Advisory Panel for purified recycled water scheme in South East Queensland, the third largest scheme of its type in the world.

Like another draftee that year, Jamie Cox, Oliver was also a gifted cricketer and captained Victoria at the Australian Under-17 Championships in 1987/88. An all-rounder, he took 11 wickets in the tournament, including that of future Test player Damien Martyn.CrickeArchive: Victoria Under-17s v Western Australia Under-17s He ultimately chose to pursue a career in football but had to wait until he was 21 to make his senior AFL debut.AFL Tables: Stephen Oliver His first two league games came in the opening two rounds of the 1992 AFL season but he had no impact and was not selected for the rest of the year. He instead had a highly successful year with Castlemaine in the Bendigo Football League (BFL), kicking over 100 goals in the home and away season, before finishing the season with a premiership. Oliver made six AFL appearances in 1993 and performed well when put at full-forward, filling in for an injured Stephen Kernahan. By the time the finals came he was out of the side and did not participate in Carlton's run to the grand final. After putting together just five games in 1994, Oliver returned home to the bush for good. He topped the BFL goal-kicking on three further occasions, in 1996, 2000 and 2005. In 2000 he had reached the one hundred goal mark for a third time, having also achieved the feat back in 1991 after a strong finals series. Castlemaine were the premiership winners in his two most prolific seasons, 1992 and 2000.

For more than a century, Springfield's North End neighborhood has served as a first home for some of the city's various immigrant communities, from Greeks in Memorial Square to Russians in Liberty Heights. As of 2011, the contemporary Puerto Rican flavor of the North End is evident in numerous banners depicting traditional Carnival masks and the coqu√≠, Puerto Rico's unofficial mascot. http://ourpluralhistory.stcc.edu/recentarrivals/index.html http://ourpluralhistory.stcc.edu/recentarrivals/russian.html As of 2011, the North End is dominated by Massachusetts' third largest employer, Baystate Health. Approximately ten years ago, the North End was considered one of Springfield's most dangerous neighborhoods; however, that perception has changed as Baystate Health has continued to expand - currently, with a $300 million addition called \\"The Hospital of the Future, which will add 550 new doctors - and from 1990-2006, Springfield's Latino community's buying power has increased over 295%. http://davidsonmediagroup.com/Stations/MAPS/DMG%20Springfield%204-07.pdf Additionally, unlike in other Northeastern cities, Springfield has been fortunate in that rather than leaving the area once adequate buying power is achieved, (as has happened in many areas of California, for example,) Springfield's Latino residents have chosen to stay - and even to further increase. These trends bode extremely well for the economic and cultural future of Springfield. http://davidsonmediagroup.com/Stations/MAPS/DMG%20Springfield%204-07.pdf Many festivals occur in the North End throughout the year. For example, during Easter, residents of the North End stage a Passion Play, depicting what happened to Jesus Christ during the last 30 hours of his life.

Salilyn's Condor (born October 5, 1987) also known as Robert, was an English Springer Spaniel, best known for being Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in Feb. 1993. He was the first Westminster winner to sire another, when his daughter Ch. Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless won Best in Show in 2000. Early life Robert was co-owned by Donna and Roger Herzig of Louisville, Kentucky, and Julia Gasow of Troy, Michigan. One of Robert's great grandfathers was Ch. Salilyn's Aristocrat, who won Best of Breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1967. Show history Immediately prior to Westminster, there is a series of specialty shows in New York to serve as warm-ups for the main competition. At the first Long Island Kennel Club Dog Show independent event in February 1990, Robert took the Best in Show title. In competition at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1992, Robert made it all the way to the Best in Show competition before being defeated by the Wire Fox Terrier Ch. Registry's Lonesome Dove. Robert was the top winning dog in America in 1992 beating some 115,651 other dogs, leading into the 1993 Westminster Show at Madison Square Garden. During that year he had won 123 groups, winning the Ken-L-Ration award in the process. Prior to Westminster he had won the American Spaniel Club's event in December 1992 for the third year in a row, tying a previous record set in the 1930s. He finished the 1992 season with his hundredth Best in Show victory, a record for sporting dogs. The previous winner of Westminster returned in the 1993 competition, along with Robert and three other dogs that made it to the previous year's Best in Show round. While Ch. Registry's Lonesome Dove was thought to be the favorite, it was Robert who was predicted to be her main opposition. In front of 10,000 spectators, Robert took the title of Best in Show at Westminster for 1993, beating seven other dogs in the final round including a German Shepherd Dog, a Borzoi and a Pekingese. Best in Show judge Barbara Heller said of Robert's victory, \\"The dog is as near to perfection as possible, He showed his heart out and I had a really hard time deciding. I always think it's easy to judge when you have good dogs, but this time it wasn't that easy because all seven were outstanding.\\" He became the first English Springer Spaniel to take the title since 1972. Following his win, he was retired from conformation showing. Robert's daughter Ch. Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless became the only offspring of a previous Westminster winner to win the same prize when she won Best in Show at the event in 2000.

According to Italian art historian Vittoria Garibaldi, it was one of the earliest commissions received by Perugino around the end of his apprenticeship in Florence (1472), while others date it to the late 1470s. The painting was originally executed for the church of Santa Maria dei Servi in Perugia, connected to the Baglioni family; in 1543 it was moved to the church of Santa Maria Nuova in the same city. Description The scene follows a standard layout, with the nativity hut on the right and the visitors' procession, developing horizontally, on the left. On the background, behind the ox and the donkey, is a rocky, hilly landscape painted using aerial perspective. The Virgin holds the blessing child on her knees, and behind her is St. Joseph, standing, with a stick. The oldest of the magi is already kneeled, while the other two are offering the gifts. The crowded procession includes figures which are common in Perugino's works, such as the boy with a turban and the blonde youngsters in elegant postures. The man on the extreme left is perhaps a self-portrait of Perugino. Style The Virgin and Child are reminiscent of Perugino's Gambier Parry Madonna at the Courtauld Institute in London,Page at the museum's website. Despite what written in the caption, it dates to the early 1470s dating to the very early 1470s. In general, the scene's style is related to Verrocchio's workshop, where Perugino made his apprenticeship. The characters, forming a crowd typical of late-Gothic art, show a robust appearance seen in the works of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, perhaps the earliest master of Perugino. The integration between the characters and the landscape is inspired to Piero della Francesca, such as the golden ratio tree; the landscape is similar to works by Leonardo da Vinci.

It was a short-lived victory for him and, in a hung parliament, his seat was taken, at the 1924 general election by Conservative, Ian Fraser (later Baron Fraser of Lonsdale). He remained in politics, however, and was re-elected to the St Pancras North seat once again in May 1929, and retained the seat until 27 October 1931, when he fell prey again to a hung parliament, the seat being regained by Ian Fraser of the Conservative Party. Biography James was the son of William Marley (1869‚Äì1948) and Margaret Shannon (1874‚Äì1922). He was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, Scotland and moved to London in 1917 to take up a teaching post at St Dominic's Boys' School in Hampstead (1917‚Äì19). During this time, he met and married his wife Alice Louise Pilgrim (1880‚Äì1945) the daughter of William Pilgrim, (1845‚Äì1922) an Inspector for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and a former policeman for the London Metropolitan Police. The marriage between James Marley and Alice Louise Pilgrim took place in Shotts, Lanarkshire on 16 May 1920. Marley died in Bromley, Kent in April 1954, aged 60.

Fast food chains have come under fire from consumer groups, such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a longtime fast food critic over issues such as caloric content, trans fats and portion sizes. Social scientists have highlighted how the prominence of fast food narratives in popular urban legends suggests that modern consumers have an ambivalent relationship (characterized by guilt) with fast food, particularly in relation to children.Robin Croft (2006), Folklore, families and fear: understanding consumption decisions through the oral tradition, Journal of Marketing Management, 22:9/10, pp1053-1076, ISSN 0267-257X Some of these concerns have helped give rise to the slow food and local food movements. These movements seek to promote local cuisines and ingredients, and directly oppose laws and habits that encourage fast food choices. Proponents of the slow food movement try to educate consumers about what its members consider the environmental, nutritional, and taste benefits of fresh, local foods.  Health based criticisms  A sign advertising inclusion of highly processed meat and sugar in a sandwich. Many fast foods are rich in calories as they include considerable amounts of mayonnaise, cheese, salt, fried meat, and oil, thus containing high fat content (Schlosser). Excessive consumption of fatty ingredients such as these results in unbalanced diet. Proteins and vitamins are generally recommended for daily consumption rather than large quantities of carbohydrates or fat. Due to their fat content, fast foods are implicated in poor health and various serious health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there is strong empirical evidence showing that fast foods are also detrimental to appetite, respiratory system function,Sharon Kirkey. ‚ÄúFast Food May Be Linked to Higher Asthma Rates; Researchers Look for Triggers of Respiratory Affliction.‚Äù Edmonton Journal, Edmonton Journal, Jan. 2009. and central nervous system function (Schlosser). In a cross-sectional data study from more than 100-thousand adolescents in 32 countries, which included low-income, middle-income, to high-income countries, it has been found that fast food is associated with increased attempt to suicide.\\"Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University Target Affective Disorders (Fast Food Consumption and Suicide Attempts among Adolescents Aged 12-15 Years from 32 Countries).\\" Obesity, Fitness & Wellness Week, 2020, pp. 660. McDonald's has received criticism for serving food high in saturated fat and calories. According to the Massachusetts Medical Society Committee Jeff Nutrition, fast foods are commonly high in fat content, and studies have found associations between fast food intake and increased body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. In particular many fast foods are high in saturated fats which are widely held to be a risk factor in heart disease.* * * * * * * * * In 2010, heart disease was the number 1 ranking cause of death.\\"Name That Fast Food\\" New York Times, 17 December 1985. GALE. Web. 6 September 2013. A 2006 study fed monkeys a diet consisting of a similar level of trans fats as what a person who ate fast food regularly would consume. Both diets contained the same overall number of calories. It was found that the monkeys who consumed higher levels of trans fat developed more abdominal fat than those fed a diet rich in unsaturated fats. They also developed signs of insulin resistance, an early indicator of diabetes. After six years on the diet, the trans fat fed monkeys had gained 7.2% of their body weight, compared to just 1.8% in the unsaturated fat group. A five-year study conducted in Singapore showed that frequent fast food consumers (more than 2 time per week) had a significant increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of death rate from coronary heart disease, when compared to non-consumers. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of about 16 grams of saturated fats a day.SaturatedFats.NHC.22 August 2013.Web.9 September 2013 The director of the obesity program for the Children's Hospital Boston, David Ludwig, says that \\"fast food consumption has been shown to increase caloric intake, promote weight gain, and elevate risk for diabetes\\". Excessive calories are another issue with fast food. According to B. Lin and E. Frazao, from the US Department of Agriculture(USDA), the percentage of calories which can be attributed to fast-food consumption has increased from 3% to 12% of the total calories consumed in the United States. A regular meal at McDonald's consists of a Big Mac, large fries, and a large Coca-Cola drink amounting to 1,430 calories. The USDA recommends a daily caloric intake of for men and women (respectively) between 31 and 50, at a physical activity level equivalent to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life, with the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety guidance suggesting roughly the same levels. However, besides fast food consumption, there are many other the other reasons for over weighting among children while they are growing, including sex development, \\"hormonal changes,\\" and social interactions. At those moments kids can feel depressed, which may lead to increase or decrease in appetite. In fact, increased hunger may lead to obesity in some cases. ‚Äú‚Ä¶seasonal effective disorder affects 1.7 ‚Äì 5.5% of youths ages 9-19 years old based on a community study of over 2,000 youth.\\" The fast food chain D'Lites, founded in 1978, specialized in lower- calorie dishes and healthier alternatives such as salads. It filed for bankruptcy in 1987 as other fast food chains began offering healthier options. McDonald's has been attempting to offer healthier options besides salads. They have incorporated fruit and milk as options of happy meals and have promoted healthier ads and packaging for kids. The Alliance for a Healthier Generation has set a standard in hopes of pressuring fast food companies to make recommended healthier adjustments.Morrison, Maureen. \\"McD's vow to promote healthful menu options puts pressure on rivals; Fast-food leader says it will offer salads instead of fries with value meals and push milk and fruit for Happy Meals in industry watershed.\\" Advertising Age 30 September 2013: 0006. General OneFile. Web. 22 November 2013.  Food poisoning risk  Besides the risks posed by trans fats, high caloric intake, and low fiber intake, another cited health risk is food poisoning. In his book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, Eric Schlosser argues Schiosser E. Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal. New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin; 2001. that meatpacking factories concentrate livestock into feedlots and herd them through processing assembly lines operated by employees of various levels of expertise, some of which may be poorly trained, increasing the risk of large-scale food poisoning. Manure on occasion gets mixed with meat, possibly contaminating it with salmonella and pathogenic E. coli. Usually spread through undercooked hamburgers, raw vegetables, and contaminated water, it is difficult to treat. In 2008, the Health Protection Agency in England showed that in a Salmonella Typhimurium infection of 179 cases, consumption of pre-packaged egg sandwiches was associated with illness. Although supportive treatment can substantially aid inflicted individuals, since endotoxin is released from gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli upon death, antibiotic use to treat E. coli infections is not recommended. About 4% of people infected with E. coli 0157:H7 develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, and about 5% of children who develop the syndrome die. The rate of developing HUS is 3 in 100,000 or 0.003%. E. coli 0157:H7 has become the leading cause of renal failure among American children. These numbers include rates from all sources of poisoning, including lettuce; radish sprouts; alfalfa sprouts; unpasteurized apple juice/cider; cold cooked or undercooked meat; and unpasteurized animal milk. Additional environmental sources include fecal- contaminated lakes, nonchlorinated municipal water supply, petting farm animals and unhygienic person-to-person contact. An average of sources leads to the number of 0.00000214% for undercooked beef.  Food-contact paper packaging  Fast food often comes in wrappers coated with polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) to prevent grease from leaking through them. These compounds are able to migrate from the wrappers into the packaged food. Upon ingestion, PAPs are subsequently biotransformed into perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), compounds which have long attracted attention due to their detrimental health effects in rodents and their unusually long half-lives in humans. While epidemiological evidence has not demonstrated causal links between PFCAs and these health problems in humans, the compounds are consistently correlated with high levels of cholesterol and uric acid, and PAPs as found on fast food packaging may be a significant source of PFCA contamination in humans.Schlosser, Eric.

On average, nearly one-third of U.S. children aged 4 to 19 eat fast food on a daily basis. Over the course of a year this is likely to result in a child gaining 6 extra pounds every year. In a research experiment published in Pediatrics, 6,212 children and adolescents ages 4 to 19 years old were examined to extrapolate some information about fast food. Upon interviewing the participants in the experiment, it was reported that on any given day 30.3% of the total sample had eaten fast food. Fast-food consumption was prevalent in both males and females, in all racial/ethnic groups, and in all regions of the country.\\"Effects of fast-food consumption on energy intake and diet quality among children in a national household survey.\\" Pediatrics 113.1 (2004): 112-118. E-Journals. EBSCO. Web. 27 Oct. 2014. Additionally, in the study children who ate fast food, compared to those who did not, tended to consume more total fat, carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Children who ate fast food also tended to eat less fiber, milk, fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. After reviewing these test results, the researchers concluded that consumption of fast food by children seems to have a negative effect on an individual's diet, in ways that could significantly increase the risk for obesity. Due to having reduced cognitive defenses against marketing, children may be more susceptible to fast food advertisements, and consequently have a higher risk of becoming obese.Brownell, Kelly. \\"In Your Face: How The Food Industry Drives Us To Eat.\\" Nutrition Action Health Letter 37.4 (2010):3. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 10 September 2013. Fast food is only a minuscule factor that contributes to childhood obesity. A study conducted by researchers at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health showed that poor diet and obesity as an overall factor are the leading causes of rising obesity rates in children. \\"While reducing fast-food intake is important, the rest of a child's diet should not be overlooked,\\" Jennifer Poti, co author and doctoral candidate in the university's Department of Nutrition. Contrary evidence has been documented that questions the correlation of a fast food diet and obesity. A 2014 People Magazine article recounts the experience of John Cisna, a science teacher at Colo-NESCO High School, who ate a fast food diet for 90 days. At the end of 90 days he had lost 37 pounds and his cholesterol level went from 249 to 170. Cisna kept to a strict 2,000 calorie limit a day and walked 45 minutes a day. Harley Pasternak, a celebrity trainer and nutrition expert, supports Cisna's experiment by saying, \\"While I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea to eat too much fast food...I do think he is right. Fast food, while far from healthy, doesn‚Äôt make people gain weight. Eating too much fast food too often is what can make you gain weight‚Äîthe same way eating too much of anything can pack on the pounds.\\" Pasternak, Harley. \\"Harley Pasternak: Can You Lose Weight Eating Fast Food?\\" People, GreatIdeas. 08 Jan. 2014. Web. 26 Mar. 2014. A cross-sectional study in China shows that the relationship between BMI and times per week fast food consumption was not significant.Ma, R., D. C. Castellanos, and J. Bachman. \\"Identifying Factors Associated with Fast Food Consumption among Adolescents in Beijing China using a Theory-Based Approach.\\" Public Health, vol. 136, 2016, pp. 87-93. Jared Fogle‚Äôs drastic weight loss on a Subway diet, which is considered a fast food chain, is another case that poses a fair debate against the idea that the culprit of obesity is fast food. Fogle dropped 235 pounds by consuming Subway sandwiches for lunch and dinner daily. With no cheese or mayonnaise, the calories of both sandwiches totaled less than 1,000 calories in a day. Fast food labels without the calorie amount increase the risks of obesity. In the article of M. Mclnerney et al. is examined the impact of fast food labeling on college students‚Äô overweighting. In the study the students required to label the calories of fast foods in the items‚Äô lists. The results showed positive effects on the decreased significance of weighting among college students. Thus, fast food restaurants need to write down the exact calories of the products to inform the consumers about their food choices in order to prevent overweight.  Fast food commercials  A 2012, estimated report by the US Federal Trade Commission revealed a $7.9 billion marketing expenditure difference between expenditure on marketing to all audiences and expenditure on marketing strictly to children and adolescents. According to this report, Fast food industries spent approximately $9.7 billion on marketing food and beverages to the general audience while they spent only $1.8 billion on marketing to children and adolescents.  Consumer responsibility  Spokespeople for the fast food industry claim that there are no good or bad foods, but instead there are good or bad diets. The industry has defended itself by placing the burden of healthy eating on the consumer, who freely chooses to consume their product outside of what nutritional recommendations allow.Brownell, Kelly.\\"In Your Face: How The Food Industry Drives Us to Eat.\\"Nutrition Action Health Letter 37.4(2010):3.MasterFILE Premier. Web. 10 September 2013. Many fast food restaurants added labels to their menus by listing the nutritional information below each item. The intent was to inform consumers of the caloric and nutritional content of the food being served there and result in directing consumers to the healthier options available. However, reports do not display any significant drop in sales at sandwich or burger locations which highlights no change in consumer behavior even after food was labeled. Fast food is also affordable on people's incomes and expenses relating to the regions they live. \\"Healthy foods including whole- grain products, low-fat dairy foods, and fresh fruits and vegetables may be less available, and relatively costlier, in poor and minority neighborhoods.\\" So, fast food stores are located in the areas where the demand by the population is high. Some other studies show that eating fast food is not dependent on a person's income. Researchers found that an amount of fast food consumed does not correlate with a person‚Äôs income level. The article \\"Wealth doesn't equal health Wealth: Fast food consequences not just for poor,\\" discusses the issue: not all rich people are healthy food consumers, nor do they consume fast food less frequently than poor people. Additionally, fast food customers work harder and longer than those who do not eat fast food daily. So, it is dependent on a person to choose their meal based on their lifestyle. A study conducted in 20 Fast Food restaurants in Australia showed that despite the availability of healthy meal options on the menu less than 3% of the consumers observed opted for a healthy meal which emulated results of other recent Australian research on consumption of healthy meals at Fast Food locations. In this 12 hour observational study, about 34% of meals purchased were take-away, meals that were excluded from the study, and 65% represented the unhealthy eat-in meals while the remaining 1% represented the healthy meals purchased. Restrained eating, or excessive consumption of fast food and other unhealthy foods high in sugar and sodium, is a category of different eating habits derived from results of a cross-sectional study in 2014. This study depicted a prominent association between restrained eating and nurses working overnight shifts and those who are under high stress. Fruits and vegetables were reported as the least likely to be consumed under stress. About 395 nurses participated in this study. All these nurses were employees of two major hospitals in the capital city, Riyadh, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The research gathered from a nationwide study in China strictly concentrated on the link between fast food consumption and the growing obesity epidemic in children, ranging from ages 6‚Äì18. Although end results weren't completely inconclusive, there was no significant relationship found between the said two parties. The variables taken into consideration to support and narrow the study, displayed that with the presence of any of the following variables low-income households, peer influence, geographical location, pocket money and independence, fast food consumption rates increased. Fast food consumption rates escalated when older children were surveyed whilst consumption rates for younger children appeared normal. Also, western fast food was preferred by children of all ages because they associated western fast food with high quality food. \\"The McLawsuit\\" was a group of overweight children that filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's seeking compensation for obesity related reasons.  The CSR Halo Effect  The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Effect is a phrase used to judge a category based on judgments from other similar categories or is in relation to them.Assiouras, Ioannis. \\"Join Academia.edu & Share Your Research with the World.\\" THE EFFECT OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON CONSUMERS' EMOTIONAL REACTIONS IN PRODUCT-HARM CRISIS. N.p., 2011. Web. 31 Jan. 2014. To put it in terms of the fast food industry, a customer who had a bad experience at a McDonald's would associate that experience with other McDonald's, casting a per-conspired image in their mind of how all other Mcdonald's are. Ioannis Assiouras states that \\"positive prior CSR leads to higher sympathy and lower anger and schadenfreude toward the company, than negative prior CSR or lack of CSR information.\\"  Worker discrepancies and strikes  Many fast food employees are adults who earn minimum wage, which in the United States is around $7.25 for every hour. Around 60% of fast food workers are twenty-five years and older. Many employees have protested to raise the minimum wage. On December 5, 2013, protesters from 100 cities in the United States held demonstrations for a $15 hourly wage. This protest was one of a series of strikes that began 2012, in New York City, protesting against low wages.Mantel, Barbara. \\"Minimum Wage.\\" CQ Researcher. 04 Jan. 2014. Web. 03 Feb. 2014. There has been a study over employee wages at the fast food companies, the study suggests the fast food industry needs to increase an hourly payment from \\"7.25 to 10.25\\" for the beginners of the job. Besides, they recommend to rise that to 5 dollars after few years of experience. From that it is clear to understand that how increased minimum wages has its effects on employees services, life style, and well being. Because workers start to work better when their life style changes as well as their payments.  Packaging waste  A 2011 study of litter in the Bay area by Clean Water Action found that nearly half of the litter present on the streets was fast food packaging. The Natural Resources Defense Council's paper ‚ÄúWaste and Opportunity 2015: Environmental Progress and Challenges in Food, Beverage, and Consumer Goods Packaging‚Äù reported that no fast food brands were meeting best practices for use of recycled materials or promotion of recycling of the used packaging. The EPA states that only a tiny proportion of the plastic waste generated by the fast food industry is recycled.MacKerron, Conrad B. \\"Waste and Opportunity 2015: Environmental Progress and Challenges in Food, Beverage, and Consumer Goods Packaging\\".

Animal cruelty  In 2015, a gruesome video clip of a T&S; farm in Dukedom, Tennessee was released by animal rights activists, where workers were caught abusing chickens. Tyson Foods, the company which delivers chicken nuggets to the fast food giant McDonald's, cancelled their contract with the farm stating \\"animal well-being\\" is their utmost priority. McDonald's supported Tyson Foods' decision and described the workers actions as unacceptable. In the fall of 2007, an investigator working for the Humane Society of the United States documented inhumane treatment of downed dairy cows, those too weak to walk, at a slaughterhouse in Chino, California. Plant workers at the Hallmark/Westland facility were filmed using a forklift to forcibly move cows who could not rise to their feet, dragging them with chains, kicking them, spraying high-pressure water hoses into their nostrils and shocking them with electric prods, all in an effort to get them to stand long enough for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) veterinary inspector to pass them for slaughter. 50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  Nutrition and health  In 2013, McDonald's announced that they would include fruits and vegetables in their menu combinations. Don Thompson, McDonald's chief executive stated, \\"We‚Äôve been trying to optimize our menu with more fruits and vegetables and giving customers additional choices when they come to McDonald‚Äôs.\\" In 2016 the company replaced the high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns with sugar and removed antibiotics that are \\"important to human medicine\\" from its chicken. They also removed artificial preservatives from their cooking oil, pork sausage patties, eggs served on the breakfast menu, and Chicken McNuggets. The skin, safflower oil and citric acid from the McNuggets was also replaced with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice. These changes were made in an effort to target \\"health-conscious consumers.\\"  Source reduction  Many fast food chains have reduced their material usage by ‚Äúlightweighting‚Äù, or reducing material in a package by weight. McDonald‚Äôs made over 10 reduction in packaging weight in 2012, such as a 48% reduction in the chicken sandwich paperboard carton, and an 18-28% reduction in its plastic cold cups. Starbucks has reduced their water bottle weight by 20% and cold cups by 15%.  Cage-free hens  Over 160 companies in the food sector have announced that they are planning to shift to eggs from only cage-free hens, most by the year 2025. The list includes McDonald‚Äôs, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, Carl‚Äôs Jr., Burger King, Denny‚Äôs, Jack in the Box, Quiznos, Shake Shack, Starbucks, Sonic, Taco Bell, Wendy‚Äôs, White Castle, and Subway, among others.

The New York Times, 9 September 2015. Web. 5 March 2017.  Proximity of fast food locations  A study of students who live within a half mile from fast food locations have been reported to consume fewer amounts of fruit and vegetables, consume more soda, and are more likely to be overweight. More other studies show that the exposure to poor-quality food environments has important effects on adolescent eating patterns and overweight. Therefore, it seems that policy interventions limiting the proximity of fast-food restaurants to schools could help reduce adolescent obesity.Davis, Brennan, and Christopher Carpenter. \\"Proximity of Fast-Food Restaurants to Schools and Adolescent Obesity.\\" American Journal of Public Health, vol. 99, no. 3, 2009, pp. 505-510.

Styles and themes P√©not was concerned first and foremost with anatomically accurate portrayals of women. Singular female forms were the implicit focus of his work, whereas the worlds surrounding his characters are seldom realized beyond misty atmospheres and patches of shadow and light. Environments are incidental and are typically shrouded in haze, giving the figures themselves explicit priority. However, P√©not was more versatile in his artistry, and was not confined exclusively to female nudes: church figures were another of his subjects, in addition to occasional compositions depicting scenes of men and women from high society in narratives framed by more conventional settings.

In 1978, Andrew John Scott made the combination Einadia hastata. After phylogenetical research, Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012) included this species in genus Chenopodium, as Chenopodium hastatum (R.Br.) S. Fuentes & Borsch., but this name was a later homonym and thus illegitimate. In 2017, Iamonico & Mosyakin replaced it by the name Chenopodium robertianum, honouring the botanist Robert Brown.

It is located at the Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. The ground on which Bellesguard stands had been the site of a country residence belonging to Martin, king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. Gaud√≠ was assisted by Joan Rubio whilst Dom√®nec Sugra√±es i Gras created the various mosaics that adorn the house.  History = Early years  Gaud√≠ drew inspiration for Casa Figueras from the medieval castle that once stood on the same site, built for the King of Aragon in the early 15th century. When the King of Aragon died without an heir in 1410, his widow, Margaret of Prades, inherited the estate. Following her death, the castle fell into decline and was passed from hand to hand over centuries until Jaume Figueres purchased the estate in 1900. When Jaume Figueres and his wife, Mar√≠a Sagues Mol√≠ns, commissioned Gaud√≠ for the project in 1900, all that remained of the initial structure were a few walls and the patio. Still, Gaud√≠ was aware of the important history this location bore to Catalonia, so he worked to preserve the medieval spirit of the ruins, as is evident in the exterior resemblance to a medieval castle, complemented by signature aspects of Gaud√≠'s architectural style. As always, Gaud√≠ sought to blend the construction with its natural surroundings, hence the exterior is made with stone slate. Through Gaud√≠'s incorporation of decorative elements resonant of natural surroundings together with traditional gothic characteristics, the fa√ßade of the structure is still best understood as neogothic, though there is no denying the modernist elements in the actual Torre Bellesguard. Gaud√≠ designed the home in a period where he himself was still developing his unique style. For instance, while the building displays Gaud√≠'s iconic mosaic detailing and incorporation of natural elements, it does not include Moorish accents and bright colors (aside from the stripes on the tower cross), which are key distinctive characteristics in much of his later works. Gaud√≠ was given free rein to design and construct what was intended as a second home for the Jaume family, however this freedom bestowed to the artist later proved disastrous for the family. Figueres died before the construction had finished, leaving the responsibility of overseeing the final construction to his wife, who grew increasingly frustrated with constant delays due to Gaud√≠'s obsessive detailing. While the months Gaud√≠ dedicated to placing tencad√≠s (his iconic mosaic detailing) on the structure are part of what makes the home so beautiful today, the process added such significant time and cost to the construction that Mol√≠ns was never actually able to live in the home and even had to sell it to avoid bankruptcy.  Guilera family  The house changed hands for several years until the Guilera family purchased the home in 1944 and has continued to own it for over 70 years. When Lluis Guilera Molas first bought Casa Figueres in 1944, the esteemed doctor intended to convert the building into a modernist hospital, similar to Sant Pau, dedicated to cancer treatment and research. The building continued to serve medical purposes following Lluis' death in 1969 when his son, Llu√≠s Guilera Soler, a gynecologist and obstetrician, inherited the home and hospital. Several Barcelona citizens were born in Casa Figueres until 1974 when the site of the hospital relocated to a more accessible area better suited to medical needs. From that point on, the original building has served the purpose that Gaud√≠ always intended‚Äîa private home. For the past 30 years, the Guilera family has left the gates open permitting guests to stroll the gardens and observe the home's exquisite exterior. Over the years, they received countless requests from visitors to explore inside the home and enjoy Gaud√≠'s more modernist interior detailing. Both due to the popular demand from visitors as well as the family's realization that restoration was necessary, the Guilera family began plans to open their home to the public in 2009. The need for restoration was a particularly strong factor in influencing the Guilera family to open their home to the public, as they realized that in living in such a historic and architectural jewel they also assumed responsibility of its preservation. As areas of the home began to deteriorate and the bustling urban life of Barcelona began to encroach on their secluded natural sanctuary, the family realized that it was time to open the home to tours to ease the finances required to maintain the unique Gaud√≠ landmark. The family officially began inviting tours in September 2013, offering access to the interior accompanied by explanations of the history and architecture.  Description = Exterior  Casa Figueres is constructed mainly of stone and brick. The general structure measures a square base of 15 √ó 15 m and is 19.5 m high, with an area of 900 m. The exterior fa√ßade is more neogothic, as Gaud√≠ intended to pay tribute to the original medieval castle that once stood at the site. As is such, Gaud√≠ used more straight lines, seldom seen in his usual work, which is especially apparent in the parapets and surface of the walls. The iconic tower, Torre Bellesguard, juts out from a corner of a base, adding to the vertical alignment of the structure created by the straight, vertical lines in his design. Torre Bellesguard is perhaps what the building is most recognized for, displaying Gaud√≠'s typical cross of four arms decorated with red and yellow mosaics to mimic the Catalan flag. At the base of the cross one can also see what appears to be a crown wrapped around the circumference, likely Gaudi's symbolic acknowledgment of the site's significance to the crown of Aragon. At the entrance of the house, one can find an inscription that reads, ‚ÄúMaria Purrisima sens pecat fou concebuda,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúPurest Maria, conceived without sin.‚Äù Above the entrance door is a stunning stained glass window in the form of the 8-pointed star of Venus.  Interior  Casa Figueres stained glass entrance window Casa Figueres consists of a ground floor, a main floor, a basement, and an attic. The interior of the home is different from the more gothic exterior, and instead demonstrates Gaud√≠'s modernist style. Gaud√≠ employed unusual placement of many windows to make use of natural light, aided by the white plastered walls, in keeping with his theme of integrating his structures with natural surroundings. The light in the entrance hall is heightened by the coloured glass of the window and the use of iron detailing. Many of the ceilings use a structure of superimposed layers of bricks, also known as the Catalan arc. From the inside, a support mechanism can be seen, resembling an iron spider- web that is used to support the tower's pinnacle. Also only visible from the inside is the dragon Gaud√≠ designed on the terrace as part of the tower base. The slate detailing of the roof illustrate the dragon's tails, with elevated areas to create the illusion of nostrils, while two windows on either side of the dragon's \\"profile\\" create the eyes.  The grounds  The grounds include remaining elements from the 15th century medieval castle, in particular some remains of the original walls which, although mimicked by the gothic aspects of Gaud√≠'s 20th century work that surround them, are still distinguishable from the more modern structure. At the entrance to the garden is the Crown of Aragon's shield, which is engraved with two dates: 1409, noting the completion of the original castle, and 1909, the year in which Gaudi's Torre Bellesguard was completed. The shield also features a rising sun symbolizing these two momentous historical moments. The mosaic benches next to the structure's fa√ßade are decorated using the Trancad√≠s technique, however these benches were actually the work of Gaudi's apprentice, Dom√®nec Sugra√±es i Gras, whose style is characterized as more uniform and Roman when compared to Gaudi's more uneven approach. Also in the garden is an iron cross, suspected to have been constructed by Gaud√≠ himself (instead of one of his apprentices). Etymology The term Bellesguard comes from the Catalan for \\"Beautiful View\\", representing the fact that the building lies at halfway up the Collserola mountain overlooking Barcelona and consequently provides wide views over the city. The name dates to the age of Martin of Aragon, who had a summer residence on the site in the 15th century and subsequently coined the name Bellesguard The Bellesguard is sometimes called the Casa Figueres because it was commissioned by Maria Sagu√©s, widow of Jaume Figueras. Sagu√©s was a longtime admirer of Gaud√≠s work and she commissioned him to design the building 1900.Zerbst Rainer, Gaud√≠, p. 129.

The park covers eight hectares and includes formal gardens, and a lake area. Some of the trees in the park today may exist from the original 1840s planting and include several varieties of oak and an avenue of cedars. The park is mainly enclosed by a perimeter belt of trees with an informal network of paths. The paths encircle the formal pond area and the croquet lawn leading to the tennis court. A path crosses a ha-ha and leads to a circular walk around the informal lake at the northwest corner of the park. A significant amount of the original Worth Park garden still exists from the early 1900s but is now in need of substantial restoration. The area around the lake obtained status as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance in 1992 and is habitat to a large variety of fauna and several rare plants. Ridley‚Äôs Court in Worth Park which dates back to 1882 has been Grade II listed.

Two Pulhamite rock structure and the fountain and pond basin have also been listed. History The park was originally a medieval deer park and formed part of the Forest of Worth stretching from Slaugham in the South to Worth in the North. The Worth Park Estate was purchased by Sir Joseph Montefiore in 1850. Joseph died in 1880 and the house and garden was remodelled by his son Francis Abraham Montefiore. The gardens were laid out over four levels to utilise the elevated position of the site. The first level was a formal garden consisting of three circular areas known as Fountain, Dutch and Sundial. The second level consisted of formal terraces with a staircase, a formal pond surrounded by ball shaped yews. The third area was open parkland and the final area a lake complete with Pulhamite rock features.

Overview of MEMS Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology is a process technology in which mechanical and electro-mechanical devices or structures are constructed using special micro-fabrication techniques. These techniques include: bulk micro-machining, surface micro-machining, LIGA, wafer bonding, etc. MEMS scale of dimensions A device is considered to be a MEMS device if it satisfies the following: * If its feature size is between 0.1 ¬µm and hundreds of micrometers. (below this range, it becomes a nano device and above the range, it is considered a mesosystem) * If it has some electrical functionality in its operation. This could include the generation of voltage by electromagnetic induction, by changing the gap between 2 electrodes or by a piezoelectric material. * If the device has some mechanical functionality such as the deformation of a beam or diaphragm due to stress or strain. * If it has a system-like functionality. The device must be integrable to other circuitries to form a system. This would be the interfacing circuitry and packaging for the device to become useful. For the analysis of every MEMS device, the Lumped assumption is made: that if the size of the device is far less than the characteristic length scale of the phenomenon (wave or diffusion), then there would be no spatial variations across the entire device. Modelling becomes easy under this assumption. The Lumped Assumption Operations in MEMS The three major operations in MEMS are: * Sensing: measuring a mechanical input by converting it to an electrical signal, e.g. a MEMS accelerometer or a pressure sensor (could also measure electrical signals as in the case of current sensors) * Actuation: using an electrical signal to cause the displacement (or rotation) of a mechanical structure, e.g. a synthetic jet actuator. * Power generation: generates power from a mechanical input, e.g. MEMS energy harvesters These three operations require some form of transduction schemes, the most popular ones being: piezoelectric, electrostatic, piezoresistive, electrodynamic, magnetic and magnetostrictive. The MEMS magnetic actuators use the last three schemes for their operation. Magnetic actuation The principle of magnetic actuation is based on the Lorentz Force Equation. :\\\\vec F_{mag} = q\\\\vec v \\\\times B When a current- carrying conductor is placed in a static magnetic field, the field produced around the conductor interacts with the static field to produce a force. This force can be used to cause the displacement of a mechanical structure. Magnetic actuation Governing equations and parameters A typical MEMS actuator is shown on the right. For a single turn of circular coil, the equations that govern its operation are: * The H-field from a circular conductor: :H(z)=\\\\frac{Ir^2}{2(r^2+z^2)^{3/2} } * The force produced by the interaction of the flux densities: :F_z=B_IA_{mag}\\\\int_z^{z+h_{mag} } \\\\frac{dHz}{dz}dz The deflection of a mechanical structure for actuation depends on certain parameters of the device. For actuation, there has to be an applied force and a restoring force. The applied force is the force represented by the equation above, while the restoring force is fixed by the spring constant of the moving structure. The applied force depends on both the field from the coils and the magnet. The remanence value of the magnet, its volume and position from the coils all contribute to its effect on the applied Force. Whereas the number of turns of coil, its size (radius) and the amount of current passing through it determines its effect on the Applied Force. The spring constant depends on the Young's Modulus of the moving structure, and its length, width and thickness. 400px Magnetostrictive actuators Magnetic actuation is not limited to the use of Lorentz force to cause a mechanical displacement. Magnetostrictive actuators can also use the theory of magnetism to bring about displacement. Materials that change their shapes when exposed to magnetic fields can now be used to drive high-reliability linear motors and actuators.. An example is a nickel rod that tends to deform when it is placed in an external magnetic field. Another example is wrapping a series of electromagnetic induction coils around a metal tube in which a Terfenol-D material is placed. The coils generate a moving magnetic field that courses wavelike down the successive windings along the stator tube. As the traveling magnetic field causes each succeeding cross section of Terfenol-D to elongate, then contract when the field is removed, the rod will actually \\"crawl\\" down the stator tube like an inchworm. Repeated propagating waves of magnetic flux will translate the rod down the tube's length, producing a useful stroke and force output. The amount of motion generated by the material is proportional to the magnetic field provided by the coil system, which is a function of the electric current. This type of motive device, which features a single moving part, is called an elastic-wave or peristaltic linear motor. (view: Video of a Magnetostrictive micro walker) Advantages of magnetic actuators * High actuation force and stroke (displacement) * Direct, fully linear transduction (in the case of electrodynamic actuation) * Bi-directional actuation * Contactless remote actuation * Low-voltage actuation * A figure of merit for actuators is the density of field energy that can be stored in the gap between the rotor and stator. Magnetic actuation has a potentially high energy density Magnet material Magnet material selection for static B-Field The operation of the magnetic actuator depends on the interaction between the field from an electromagnet and a static field. To produce this static field, it is important to use the right material. In MEMS, permanent magnets have become the favorite because they have a very good scaling factor and they retain their magnetization even when there is no external field... meaning that they need not be continuously magnetized when they are in use Integrating the magnet into the MEMS device As earlier discussed, MEMS devices are designed and fabricated using special micro-fabrication techniques. The major challenge however for magnetic MEMS is the integration of the magnet into the MEMS device. Recent research has suggested solutions to this challenge. Fabrication (or molding) of the magnet There are several ways by which the magnet could be fabricated on a MEMS structure: Sputtering * Sputtering: Argon ion bombardment of the material release particles of the material. Mainly for depositing rare earth magnets. Deposition rate and film surface area depend on sputtering tool and target size Pulsed Layer Deposition * Pulsed Layer Deposition: a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material that is to be deposited * Electroplating * Screen printing * Wax/Parylene bonding Issues with magnetic actuation * High-power dissipation. This is a major problem for magnetic MEMS, but work is underway to circumvent this. * Fabrication of the coil * Integration of the micromagnet into the MEMS device * Process-material compatibility * Integratability into the overall microfabrication process (maintain cost and throughput) * So that preexisting processes in the fabrication of the MEMS device will not be tampered with, deposition temperatures and post-deposition treatment/conditions must be tolerable. Also, the micromagnet must be able to withstand any chemical treatment that will come after its deposition * Issues with magnetization (One may want to have more than one direction of magnetization; this creates a problem) Each of these challenges can be mitigated or lessened by the right choice of material, choice of molding or fabrication method, and the type of device that is to be constructed. Applications of the magnetic actuator include: the synthetic jet actuator, micro-pumps and micro-relays.

Between 1817 and 1825, the American West Indies Squadron constantly pursued pirates on sea and land, primarily around Cuba and Puerto Rico. After the capture of Roberto Cofresi in 1825, acts of piracy became rare and the operation was considered a success although limited occurrences went on until slightly after the start of the 20th-century.Wombwell Operations Map of early 1800s West Indies United States Navy and U.S. Revenue Marine ships had operated against piracy and the slave trade in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico for several years prior to 1822 when a permanent squadron was formed. After a September 1821 attack by pirates, in which three American merchant ships were captured, Congress authorized Commodore James Biddle to deploy a fleet to the Caribbean. This force consisted of two frigates, , and , two corvettes, and , two sloops-of-war, and , two brigs, and , the schooners , , and . Gun schooners from the revenue marine USRC Alabama and USRC Louisiana. As well as two other revenue marine gunboats, and also participated with a total of over 1,500 personnel. Before the fleet was sent, only single ship operations had been undertaken. Over the course of a few decades the American West Indies Squadron continually engaged Spanish, Venezuelan, Cuban and Puerto Rican pirates. Many of the actions ended with the sinking or capturing of pirate vessels though often the outlaws escaped to shore. 1817‚Äì1821 During and after the Spanish American wars of independence, Spanish naval power in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico weakened, allowing for a resurgence of piracy along the Gulf Coast. Many of the pirates in the period were Latin Americans and doubled as privateers. Revolution against Spain was widespread and both the rebel governments and the Spanish issued letters of marque. Often the privateers captured American merchantmen and attacked their crews which resulted in them being branded as pirates. Revenue Marine Service Revenue cutters were dispatched to fight the pirates early on. The first anti-piracy action from the service happened back in 1793 the Cutter Diligence ran a pirate vessel ashore in the Chesapeake Bay. After the success, revenue cutters were charged with suppressing piracy and protecting the shores of America. In 1819, the one-gun schooners USRC Alabama and USRC Louisiana along with the two gunboats joined the first established anti-piracy U.S. Naval fleet. The ships fought major engagements with pirates, on the open sea, and a notable Battle of Breton Island. On 1818 June 22, Boarding parties from the Revenue cutter Dallas seized the privateer Young Spartan, her crew, and the privateer's prize, the Pastora, off Savannah, Georgia. The crew of the Pastora had set adrift, and their fate remained unknown. The New York Evening Post noted that the crew of the privateer had committed offenses \\"that can only be expiated by making their exits on the gallows.\\" The Revenue Cutter Active captured the pirate vessel India Libre in the Chesapeake Bay on July 18 in 1818. On 1819 August 31. The Capture of the schooner Bravo led by Pirate Captain Jean Le Farges‚Äô vessel engaged cutters Louisiana and Alabama off the coast of Florida. The cutters‚Äô crews boarded the enemy and took the ship in a hand-to-hand struggle. Le Farges, a lieutenant of Jean Lafitte, was later hanged from Louisiana's yardarm. On 19 July 1820, Alabama captured four pirate ships off La Balize. and manned with several cutter men would engage , Alabama engaged pirates again, which resulted in the taking of five more pirate ships. This campaign was the beginning of the Anti-piracy, Coastal Defense, and Maritime law enforcement mission which is still practiced in the modern U.S. Coast Guard today. Navy engagements The first American Navy vessels to serve against West Indies piracy were the schooners USS Enterprise, and were among the vessels deployed between 1817 and 1822. All of these ships operated independently and there was no commander of the squadron until its official establishment. In 1819 President James Monroe sent Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry to Venezuela with the frigate , the corvette USS John Adams and USS Nonsuch. The commodore's orders were to demand restitution for the capture of American merchant ships by Venezuelan privateers and to receive an assurance that the privateers would be restrained from attacking again. Perry was successful in completing his mission initially and a treaty was signed on August 11, though on his cruise back to the United States, he died of yellow fever at Trinidad which caused the agreement to fail. On December 22, 1817, USS John Adams forced the filibuster Luis Aury to evacuate his base at Amelia Island, Florida. Later, John Adams was flagship of Commodore Biddle's squadron. By 1820, hostilities with the pirates and privateers started to increase, United States warships engaged in several naval actions that year and a total of twenty-seven American merchant ships were captured. In Between 1818 and 1821, USS Enterprise captured thirteen pirate and slave ships while serving with the New Orleans Squadron and later in the West Indies. On October 24, 1819, while under command of Lieutenant J. R. Madison, USS Lynx captured two pirate schooners and two boats in the Gulf of Mexico and on November 9, she captured another pirate boat in Galveston Bay. Lynx disappeared in January 1820 while sailing to Jamaica, she likely sank due to a storm, none of her crew were ever seen or heard from again. In October, 1821, while sailing off Cape Antonio, Cuba, USS Enterprise came to the assistance of three merchantmen which had been seized by four pirate craft. Boats were launched and attacked the brigands, in the end, over forty pirates were killed or captured and two of their vessels taken. A month later, Enterprise attacked a pirate base near Cape Antonio and cleared the area criminals. In September 1821, three American merchant ships were massacred off Matanzas, Cuba. The crew of one ship was tortured and the vessel was set on fire, survivors were able to escape to shore in a boat. Three men were killed on the second American ship and everyone on the third vessel which was also burned. This incident was one of the main reasons why the anti-piracy operation was continued. USS Hornet captured a privateer schooner named Moscow on October 29, 1821 and on December 21, she captured a pirate ship apparently without a fight and the crew escaped to shore. On December 16, 1821, Lieutenant James Ramage in USS Porpoise was sailing off Cape Antonio and found five enemy vessels, including the merchant brig Bolina. Forty sailors were lowered into five boats and Ramage led the advance. Though some of the pirates fled to shore, many resisted and the five American boats destroyed the five pirate ships by burning them. They also freed the Bolina. Three pirates were captured and several killed according to reports. In autumn of 1821, USS Spark, under Lieutenant John Elton, departed Boston and joined the list of vessels assigned to counter piracy. In January 1822, Elton captured a Dutch flagged pirate sloop. Seven prisoners were taken to Charleston for trial, Spark then returned to the Caribbean and remained on station for the next three years by which time the official West Indies Squadron was formed. 1822‚Äì1823 Walking the Plank by Howard Pyle. Three significant engagements occurred between the British and the pirates in 1822 and 1823. In March, boat crews from USS Enterprise captured two launches and four boats in a creek near Cape Antonio and on March 6, they seized eight more craft and over 150 pirates. A British merchantman under Captain William Smith was taken over by Spanish pirates of the schooner Emanuel in July 1822. The pirates made the British commander walk the plank and when he attempted to swim away, he was shot in the back. Also on the ship was the captain's fourteen-year-old son, the boy's head was crushed by the pirate captain when he could no longer stand to hear the crying child. USS Grampus encountered the brig Palyrma flying Spanish colors on August 15, 1822. Commanding Lieutenant Gregory suspected the ship to be a pirate so he approached to board but as Grampus drew near, Palyrma opened fire and a brief three and a half minute battle was fought. After boarding the wrecked vessel, the pirates were found to be from Puerto Rico and had a letter of marque that was intended to get the outlaws out of a situation like this. The letter was found to be fake so the pirates were detained and handed over to the Spanish in Cuba. At this time the usual procedure for dealing with captured pirates was turning them over to Spain because the United States didn't have the authority to imprison them.Konstam, 2007 p.198 The United States Navy could not pursue the pirates on Spanish soil either so in April 1822, Commodore David Porter, in USS Macedonian, assumed command of the station and one of his first missions was to consult with Governor Captain General Don Nicholas Mahy of Cuba and the governor of Puerto Rico. Both governors denied Porter's request to allow American shore parties to land but at the same time the United States government permitted the West Indies Squadron to do so but only in remote areas. Commodore Porter then attacked and destroyed a pirate force at Funda Bay, Cuba between September 28 and 30, 1822. Also on September 28, Peacock captured a boat filled with pirates about from Havana, and later that afternoon, USS Peacock encountered the merchant vessel Speedwell which had been attacked by pirates two hours before. In response, Captain Stephen Cassin launched a boat expedition which captured four schooners but again most of the pirates escaped. On September 30, 1822, the twenty-six gun was escorting a one-gun merchant sloop Eliza when attacked by a five-gun pirate felucca named Firme Union. During the engagement that ensued, the British boarded and captured the pirate ship. Ten pirates were killed and the rest abandoned ship and escaped. On November 2, 1822, along with USS Peacock and the Royal Navy schooner captured five pirate vessels off Havana. On November 8, 1822, Lieutenant William Howard Allen of USS Alligator was killed in battle while leading an attack against three enemy schooners which were holding five merchantmen hostage. In the action, two of the schooners were captured and at least fourteen pirates were killed. Due to Lieutenant Allen's death, Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson authorized Commodore Porter to procure new vessels for the squadron. Porter acquired eight new shallow draft schooners, five large barges, a steam powered riverboat and a storeship schooner. The schooners were each armed with three guns and became the , , , , , , , and the . The storeship was and the steamer became . The new squadron left the United States for Cuba on February 15, 1823. Commodore Biddle also received new orders of conduct: he was now able to land shore parties in populated areas as long as he informed the locals first. Biddle was also ordered to cooperate with any other sovereign naval forces operating against pirates. of six guns captured the eight-gun schooner La Cata on March 1, 1823 south of Cuba. Thirty brigands were killed in action and only three were taken prisoner out of a force of over 100 men. USS Fox was sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in March 1823 to obtain a list of all legally commissioned privateers and a details of their instructions. When the American schooner entered San Juan Harbor on March 3, an artillery battery fired on the ship. A few shots hit the Fox which mortally wounded her commander, Lieutenant William H. Cocke. Commodore Porter later accepted an apology for the incident from Puerto Rico's governor. The British warships Tyne and of eighteen guns defeated the notorious pirate Captain Cayatano Aragonez's thirteen-gun ship Zaragozana on March 31, in a running battle, the two British ships chased Captain Aragonez into Mata Harbor where boats were lowered and captured the vessel. Ten pirates were killed and twenty eight were captured while the Royal Navy sustained only slight casualties. Two barges, and , liberated an American merchant vessel on April 8. The navy sailors killed two of the pirates and arrested one other though most got away. On April 16, Mosquito, Gallinipper and USS Peacock, spotted a felucca off Colorados, Cuba. Peacock managed to capture the felucca though its crew fled to shore before scuttling three of their schooners. Grampus rescued the crew of the American schooner Shiboleth after it was taken by pirates in June 1823. The brigands had boarded the merchantman silently, killed the guards, and then cornered the remainder of the crew within the ship. The pirates robbed the ship and set her on fire, Grampus arrived when Shiboleth was still burning and took off her surviving crew. A few days later, pirates attacked another merchant before being detected by the Spanish Army and captured. USS Ferrets crew skirmished with the brigands in June. During one incident, Ferret found a few pirate craft in shallow water off Matanzas. First Ferret attacked using her broadside guns and sank two of the boats which were fleeing along the coast. Due to the low depth, a boat was used to attack the remaining craft but when the Americans came within range, the pirates opened fire and shot a hole through their boat which returned to Ferret and sank. With their only boat destroyed, the Americans were forced to continue their patrol and the brigands got to shore. Later that day, Ferret commandeered a small vessel with a shallow draft and returned to where their boat was sunk, hoping to engage the pirates again but bad weather stopped the operation. The following morning the Americans encountered a British merchantman which gave them a boat. Again Ferret returned to Matanzas Bay but all that was there was the two sunken boats that she destroyed earlier. On July 5, 1823, USS Sea Gull, under the command of Lieutenant William H. Watson, with the barges Gallinipper and Mosquito, fought pirates off Matanzas, near where Lieutenant Allen was killed a year earlier. The three American vessels encountered a heavily armed schooner, with a crew of about seventy-five, near a Cuban village. The United States Navy attacked with their cannon and the schooner was hit so her captain began a retreat. When further hits struck the schooner, the pirates panicked and began to abandon ship by jumping into the water. The barges maneuvered in close to the schooner and the sailors and marines on board fired volleys into their fleeing enemy, shouting \\"Allen, Allen\\" in the process. Fifteen pirates made it ashore but were attacked by an American landing party. Eleven more were killed and the last four were captured by the Cuban villagers. In total about seventy pirates were killed while only five survived. On July 21, the commanders of Beagle and Greyhound were investigating Cape Cruz, Cuba in a boat when it was fired upon from the shore. The Americans withdrew to their ship and on the next morning they landed sailors and marines who attacked and destroyed a makeshift fort. The pirates evaded the American shore party but their base was dismantled and a few heavy artillery pieces were removed. USS Sea Gull, with Ralph Voorhees in command, recaptured the merchant schooner Pacification from pirates on March 30. 1824‚Äì1825 A monument of Roberto Cofresi in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. Throughout the history of the West Indies Squadron, tropical disease was common among the American warships which had to sail back to the United States when outbreaks occurred. By January 1824, most of the West Indies Squadron ships had been recalled, mainly because of illness though in February, the squadron under Commodore Porter, sailing in flagship , returned to operate for a few months before sailing north again in July. During this time, piracy in Puerto Rican waters began to briefly rise until mid-1825: between July and August, ten attacks on American merchant vessels were reported and only a few warships remained on station. By October the majority were back in home waters. Commodore Porter was relieved of duty in February 1825 and joined the Mexican Navy; this was after the Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico detained USS Peacocks commander Lieutenant Platt in October 1824. That month pirates raided Saint Thomas in the Danish Virgin Islands and returned to Fajardo with $5,000 worth of stolen merchandise from an American owned business. The stores owner requested that Lieutenant Platt help him recover his goods. Platt landed men in Fajardo on October 27. In order to not alert the pirates, the shore party wore civilian clothes and as a result, they were arrested by the Spanish Army and charged with piracy. Platt explained why he was out of uniform and later the Spanish allowed for one of his men to retrieve the lieutenant's uniform and commission. Upon seeing this, the Americans were released. When Commodore Porter heard of this he sailed to Fajardo with USS John Adams, Beagle and Grampus. There he landed a shore party on November 14 and demanded an apology from the Spanish. Eventually the Spaniards agreed to make a public apology so the expedition boarded their ships and sailed away. The United States government was not happy with Commodore Porter's actions and he was court martialed before resigning his commission. The American operation against West Indies pirates was declared a victory in 1825 though occasional outbreaks of piracy continued. In March 1825, Gallinipper was accompanied by the frigate and the schooners and in an operation against Cuban pirates. United States Navy Lieutenant Isaac McKeever commanded and led an attack against a hostile schooner at the mouth of the Sagua la Grande. American and British forces took the ship, killed eight enemies and captured nineteen others, incurring only one man wounded. On the following day, another schooner was captured but the pirates escaped and the vessel was taken without bloodshed. El Mosquito, the ship of famed pirate Roberto Cofres√≠ was disabled on March 2, by USS Grampus and two Spanish sloops off Boca del Infierno. With his crew scattered, the pirate captain fled inland, where a local by the name of Juan Garay recognized and ambushed him allowing the authorities to capture him. Cofres√≠ was considered the last Caribbean pirate to be successful. After he was executed on March 29, 1825, piracy declined in the region for good. United States naval operations in the West Indies were eventually turned over to the Home Squadron and the Brazil Squadron by 1842.

In addition, the lower the numbers for the DRASTIC index after the assessment of the aquifer, than the lower the risk of aquifer contamination in that area.Bukowski, P., Bromek, T., & Augustyniak, I. (2006). Using the DRASTIC System to Assess the Vulnerability of Ground Water to Pollution in Mined Areas of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Mine Water and the Environment, 15‚Äì22. These seven parameters derive DRASTIC summary index score, which determines which are more prone to contamination than other. The significance of the DRASTIC summary index score is that it shows areas that are more prone; as a result, the state or local authorities depending on the scale will place necessary measures in place that would prevent or mitigate contamination of the water supply. Using GIS, a map was developed for the seven counties (Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Sarasota, DeSoto, and Charlotte) in Florida, which shows the DRASTIC summary index score for the Floridan Aquifer System, Surficial Aquifer System, and Other Rocks aquifer. The developed map is a combination of multiple layers that are stacked on top of each other as shown in Figure 1.

Due to an increase in the rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, scientific efforts have focused on finding either naturally-made or genetically modified compounds that can treat and or prevent these harmful and sometimes deadly bacteria. Sophoraflavanone G, due to its use as a phytoncide, has been found to impact the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and enhance the effect of currently used antibiotics.  Background information on phytoncides 1st discovered by B.P. Tokin, the word ‚Äúphytoncide‚Äù literally means, exterminated by the plant. Phytoncides are a biologically active substance of plant origin that kills or inhibits growth and development of bacteria, microscopic fungi, and protozoa. Phytoncides play an important role in plant immunity and in the relationships between organisms within an ecosystem. The ability to produce phytoncides is a quality common among plants. The release of phytoncides increase when a plant is injured. Phytoncide compound composition's vary depending on whether the compound is considered a glycoside, terpenoid, or other secondary metabolites (not found in the major classes of natural compounds).Duka, R., and Ardelean, D. ‚ÄúPhytoncides and Phytoalexins ‚Äì Vegetal Antibiotics.‚Äù Jurnal Medical Aradean (Arad Medical Journal) 13 (2010): 19-25.  Categories of phytoncides  There are two categories of phytoncides: 1) Nonexcretory phytoncides (found in the protoplasma of cells) and 2) Volatile phytoncides (released into the atmosphere, soil and water) Examples of plants releasing each type of phytoncide are: (nonexcretory)onion, garlic, and horseradish, and (volatile) pine, oak, eucalyptus, and members of the Sophora genus.Sophora Flavescens Some phytoncides effect only insects feeding on the plant, acting on the insect‚Äôs autonomic nervous system. Other phytoncides target mainly microbes. The antimicrobial potency and range of phytoncides vary greatly among species. Some can kill many types of protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and insects within minutes or seconds, while others may take hours or only harm the pest. In addition to acting as a ‚Äúplant protector‚Äù, phytoncides can also impede the reproduction of pests.  General effect on environment  Regarding how phytoncides effect a plant‚Äôs immunity, for example, 1 hectare of pine forest will release approximately 5 kg of volatile phytoncides into the atmosphere in one day, reducing the amount of microflora in the air and essentially sterilizing the atmosphere among the forest, containing only about 200-300 bacterial cells/m3. This effect is found more commonly in coniferous forests as opposed to deciduous; something to consider when planning resort locations and urban landscaping. General uses of phytoncides Because of the antimicrobial properties of phytoncides, extensive research has been done to investigate their use in medicine, as a plant protector in greenhouses, and in the shipping and storing of perishables like fruits and vegetables. One volatile phytoncide, sophoraflavanone G, is of particular interest, due to its use in treating methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- resistant enterococci bacteria. Sophoraflavanone G USDA Map of North American plant hardiness zones Sophoraflavanone G is among the volatile category of phytoncides, released into the atmosphere, soil, and ground water by the plant species Sophora flavescens,Sophora flavescens (5 February 2011) Sophora pachycarpa, and Sophora exigua; all found to grow within the United States in a variety of soil types, within temperate conditions, no lower than 0¬∞F (US zone 6 - yellow areas shown to the right). Sophoraflavanone G is released in order to protect the plant against harmful protozoa, bacteria, and fungi. Sophoraflavanone G, also called kushenin (in traditional Chinese medicinal recipes), is a flavonoid compound. Flavonoids Flavonoids are a class of secondary metabolites found in plants that fulfill a wide variety of functions. They are most commonly known as plant pigments in flower petals to attract pollinators and for their antioxidant activities, providing some hope for consumers regarding medicinal uses, potentially cancer treatment. It has not been until recently that their use as a phytoncide was made known.Flavonoids (8 April 2011)  Toxicity  No known toxicity reports against humans have been found related to phytoncides, including Sophoraflavanone G. Uses of Sophoraflavanone G: antimicrobial agent against MRSA and VRE In result to the increasing cases of MRSA and VRE, a tremendous amount of research has gone into finding reliable methods of controlling and potentially preventing antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. One promising candidate for the treatment of these deadly bacteria is sophoraflavanone G. Throughout the scientific literature, it has been cited that sophoraflavanone G has had considerable success against antibiotic- resistant bacteria like S. aureus and Enterococci. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus are two of the leading causes of nosocomial (contracted while in a health facility) infections in hospitals and nursing homes, and reports on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in hospitals have increased worldwide. S.aureus Enterococcus MRSA involves a strain of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that normally lives on the skin and sometimes in the nasal passages of healthy people. In addition, these particular strains of S. aureus do not respond to some of the antibiotics used to treat staph infections. The bacteria can cause infection when they enter the body through a cut, sore, catheter, or breathing tube. Once infected, the case can be minor and local, or more serious, involving complications with the major tissues within the patient, specifically heart, lungs, blood, and bone. Serious staph infections are more common in people with weak immune systems, particularly patients in hospitals and long-term healthcare facilities and those who are healthy, but otherwise in close contact with many individuals through shared use of equipment and personal items, like athletes and children in daycare. Serious staph infections are quite difficult to treat, due to increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus in the population. If left untreated, serious staph infections can result in organ failure and death. Enterococcus are normally present in the human intestines, female genital tract and often within the environment. When these bacteria cause infections, usually within the urinary tract, bloodstream, or in wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures, the common antibiotic used to treat these cases is Vancomycin. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and are, in result, referred to as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most of these infections occur within the long-term healthcare setting. Serious VRE infections are common among those who have been previously treated with the antibiotic vancomycin and hospitalized for long periods of time, those who have a weak immune system, any patients who have recently undergone surgery or those individuals with medical devices that stay inside their bodies for long periods of time (mainly catheters). VRE is often spread by the contaminated hands of caregivers, or directly after those infected with VRE, touch surfaces. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. = Research into antimicrobial activity of Sophoraflavanone G = Research conducted in Japan, in 1995, report that the use of sophoraflavanone G completely inhibits the growth of 21 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus at concentrations of 3.13-6.25 ug/mL. When this compound is combined with vancomycin, minocycline, and rifampicin, the rates of inhibition increased, indicating a partially synergistic effect with anti-MRSA antibiotics (Sato et al.).Sato, M., Tsuchiya, H., Takase, I., Kureshiro, H., Tanigaki, S. and Iinuma, M. ‚ÄúAntibacterial activity of flavanone isolated from Sophora exigua against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and its combination with antibiotics.‚Äù Phytotherapy Research 9 (1995): 509‚Äì512. Similarly in Iran, in 2006, a research group reported that the antibacterial activity of gentamycin was enhanced through the use of sophoraflavanone G, citing that bacterial colonies of Staphylococcus aureus, on TLC plates showed significant decrease (4x) in growth while in the presence of small amounts (.03 ug/mL) of this compound (Fakhimi et al.).Fakhimi A, Iranshahi M, Emami SA, Amin-Ar-Ramimeh E, Zarrini G, Shahverdi AR. ‚ÄúSophoraflavanone G from sophora pachycarpa enhanced the antibacterial activity of gentamycin against Staphylococcus aureus.‚Äù Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung C. (Journal of Biosciences) Sep-Oct(9-10) 2006:769-72 Additional studies, done in South Korea in 2009 and Romania in 2010, support these findings of partially synergistic effects between sophoraflavanone G and various antibiotics, adding that when used either alone, or in conjunction with ampicillin and oxacillin (Cha et al.),Cha J., Moon S., Kim J., Jung E., Lee Y. ‚ÄúAntibacterial activity of sophoraflavanone G isolated from the roots of sophora flavescens against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.‚Äù Phytotherapy Research 23 Sep(9) 2009: 1326-31. and ampicillin, gentamycin, minocycline, vancomycin, and hydrochloride (Duka et al.), sophoraflavanone G increases the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (MRSA & VRE) killed within plated colonies (based on FIC indices). = Additional uses of Sophoraflavanone G = In addition to the use of sophoraflavanone G as treatment against bacteria and other microflora present within the environment, by plants and humans alike, this compound has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of a variety of maladies, ranging from Eicosanoid-related skin inflammation such as atopic dermatitis, to treating more serious medical issues like malaria and myeloid leukemia.

(2002) reported that sophoraflavanone G inhibited eicosanoid generating enzymes, and prostaglandin production, suggesting its potential use for eicosanoid-related skin inflammation such as atopic dermatitis.Kim D., Chi Y., Son K., Chang H., Kim J., Kang S., and Kim H. ‚ÄúEffects of sophoraflavanone G, a prenylated flavonoid from Sophora flavescens on cyclooxygenase-2 and in vivo inflammatory response.‚Äù Archives of Pharmacal Research Jun 25(3) 2002:329-35. In 2004, Youn et al. reported that sophoraflavanone G (in addition to other flavanoids) showed moderate anti-malarial activities based on the EC50 values within mice populations, potentially due to methoxyl groups found within the structure.Youn Chul Kim, Hye-Sook Kim, Yusuke Wataya, Dong Hwan Sohn, Tai Hyun Kang, Myung Soo Kim, Yong Man Kim, Geon-Mok Lee, Jong-Duk Chang and Hyun Park, ‚ÄúAntimalarial Activity of Lavandulyl Flavanones Isolated from the Roots of Sophora flavescens‚Äù, Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin 27 (2004): 748-750. In addition, sophoraflavanone G has also been said to have implications for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, based on the research findings of Kang et al. (2000), who reported that sophoraflavanone G exhibited cytotoxic activity against human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells.Tai-Hyun Kang, Sei-Joon Jeong, Won- Gil Ko, Na-Young Kim, Byung-Hoon Lee, Masanori Inagaki, Tomofumi Miyamoto, Ryuichi Higuchi, and Youn-Chul Kim. ‚ÄúCytotoxic Lavandulyl Flavanones from Sophora flavescens.‚Äù Journal of Natural Products 5 (2000):680‚Äì681.

In 1957 he travelled to Salisbury to take up a teaching post, soon becoming involved in the anti-colonial political struggle, and developing a close friendship with Terence Ranger. The diaries offer a unique insight into the daily lives of those involved in the Liberation movement, and reveal how he was drawn deeper and deeper into what would become a very dark and dangerous situation.

Life and family Finch was the second son of Sir William Finch, who was knighted for his services at the siege of Therouanne in 1513, and attended Henry VIII with a great retinue in 1520. His mother, his father's first wife, was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Cromer of Tunstall, Kent, and widow of Sir Richard Lovelace. An elder brother, Lawrence, died without issue, and Thomas succeeded to his father's property. He was trained as a soldier, and in 1553 was engaged in suppressing Wyatt's rebellion in Kent. On the day after Mary's coronation (2 October 1553) he was knighted. Soon after Elizabeth's accession (1559), Nicholas Harpsfeld, archdeacon of Canterbury, threatened violent resistance to the new ecclesiastical legislation, and Finch was despatched to Canterbury to disarm his household. Early in 1563 he was appointed, in succession to Sir Adrian Poynings, knight- marshal of the army then engaged in war about Le Havre. He at once sent his half-brother, Sir Erasmus Finch, to take temporary charge, and his kinsman Thomas Finch to act as provost-marshal. He himself embarked in the Greyhound in March with two hundred followers, among them James and John Wentworth, brothers of Lord Wentworth, another brother of his own, a brother of Lord Cobham, and a nephew of Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick. When nearing Havre the ship was driven back by contrary winds towards Rye. Finch and his friends induced the captain - 'a very good seaman,' says Stow - 'to thrust into the haven before the tide,' and 'so they all perished' with the exception of 'seven of the meaner sort' (19 March). The news reached the court two days later, and produced great consternation.Cecil to Sir Thomas Smith in Wright, Queen Elizabeth, i. 133 A ballad commemorating the misfortune was licensed to Richard Griffith at the time.Collier, Stationers' Registers, 1557-70, Shakespeare Soc. 73 Finch was buried at Eastwell, Kent. Marriage and Family Finch married Catherine, daughter and coheiress of Sir Thomas Moyle, chancellor of the court of augmentations, and thus came into possession of Moyle's property of Eastwell, at his death 2 October 1560. He owned other land in Kent, and on 9 December 1558 Aloisi Pruili, Cardinal Pole's secretary, requested Cecil to direct Finch to allow the officers of the cardinal, then just dead, to dispose of oxen, hay, wood, and deer belonging to their late master in St. Augustine's Park, Canterbury.Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1547-80, p. 116 His widow remarried Nicholas St. Leger, and died 9 Feb. 1586-7. Of his children, three sons and a daughter survived him. The second son, Sir Henry Finch, serjeant-at-law, is separately noticed. The third, Thomas, died without issue in the expedition to Portugal in 1589. The daughter, Jane, married George Wyatt of Allington Castle, Boxley, Kent, son of Sir Thomas Wyatt, whose rebellion Finch had been sent to quell in 1554. Finch's heir, Moyle, created a baronet 27 May 1611, married in 1574 Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Heneage of Copt Hall, Essex ; inherited Eastwell on his mother's death in 1587 ; obtained a license to enclose one thousand acres of land there, and to embattle his house, 18 Jan. 1589, and died 14 December 1614. His widow was created, in consideration of her father's services, Viscountess Maidstone, 8 July 1623, and Countess of Winchilsea, 12 July 1628, both titles being granted with limitation to heirs male. She died and was buried at Eastwell in 1633. Her eldest son, Thomas, succeeded her as Earl of Winchilsea. Her fourth son, Sir Heneage Finch, was speaker of the House of Commons, 1626-31.

It also raises money for poverty reduction projects across the globe. The campaign began in Melbourne, Australia in 2010 and has since spread to the UK, USA, New Zealand, Canada, and Colombia. History Live Below the Line was started in Australia by Rich Fleming and Nick Allardice from The Global Poverty Project and The Oaktree Foundation. They had been fighting poverty for a number of years and were worried about public awareness of the subject. The aim was to highlight the issue of extreme poverty and promote change for the world's poor. Live Below the Line was created in June 2010 and its first campaign ran in August that year. Over 2,000 people participated and $520,000 was raised. By 2019 a total of $11.2m AUD has been raised in the Australian version of the campaign. The Live Below the Line challenge has been taken by a number of international celebrities, including actors Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck, Tom Hiddleston, and singer Josh Groban. Within Australia, the challenge has been taken by Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, former Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan, actors Stephen Curry and Rhiannon Fish, Masterchef Australia winners Julie Goodwin and Kate Bracks, musicians Lindsay McDougall and Sarah McLeod, radio hosts Alex Dyson and Veronica Milsom, and 2011 Australian of the Year Simon McKeon. Live Below the Line is run as a joint venture between The Global Poverty Project and The Oaktree Foundation. How the line is calculated In 2005 the World Bank defined the Extreme Poverty Line as $1.25 US a day - that is, someone would be considered to live in extreme poverty if they lived on an amount equivalent to somebody living in the United States, buying United States goods with US$1.25 a day. In 2011 (taking into account inflation and purchasing power), the equivalent amounts for the United States, Australia and United Kingdom are US$1.50, A$2 and ¬£1 respectively. The figure is determined by translating the 2005 figure into a local currency figure (using purchasing power parity) and then accounting for inflation since the 2005 date. A more detailed explanation of how the Australian figure was arrived at is available on the Global Poverty Project's site.

Endpoints communicate based on named data instead of IP addresses. CCN is characterized by the basic exchange of content request messages (called \\"Interests\\") and content return messages (called \\"Content Objects\\"). It is considered an information-centric networking (ICN) architecture. The goals of CCN are to provide a more secure, flexible and scalable network thereby addressing the Internet's modern-day requirements for secure content distribution on a massive scale to a diverse set of end devices. CCN embodies a security model that explicitly secures individual pieces of content rather than securing the connection or \\"pipe\\". It provides flexibility by using data names instead of host names (IP addresses). Additionally, named and secured content resides in distributed caches automatically populated on demand or selectively pre-populated. When requested by name, CCN delivers named content to the user from the nearest cache, traversing fewer network hops, eliminating redundant requests, and consuming less resources overall. CCN began as a research project at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 2007. The first software release (CCNx 0.1) was made available in 2009.CCNx Current Code Release, Retrieved 1 August 2014.

The protocol specification for CCNx 1.0 has been made available for comment and discussion. Work on CCNx happens openly in the ICNRG IRTF research group.  Specification  The CCNx specification was published in some IETF drafts. The specifications included: * draft-irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics-01 * draft-irtf- icnrg-ccnxmessages-01 * draft-mosko-icnrg-ccnxurischeme-00 Seamless data integration within an open-run environment was proposed as a major contributing factor in protecting the security of cloud-based analytics and key network encryption. The driving force in adopting these heuristics was twofold: Batch-interrupted data streams remaining confined to an optimal run environment; and secure shared cloud access depending upon integrative analytic processes.  Software  The CCNx software was available on GitHub.  Motivation and benefits  The functional goal of the Internet Protocol as conceived and created in the 1970s was to enable two machines, one comprising resources and the other desiring access to those resources, to have a conversation with each other. The operating principle was to assign addresses to end-points, thereby enabling these end-points to locate and connect with one another. Since those early days, there have been fundamental changes in the way the Internet is used ‚Äî from the proliferation of social networking services to viewing and sharing digital content such as videos, photographs, documents, etc. Instead of providing basic connectivity, the Internet has become largely a distribution network with massive amounts of video and web page content flowing from content providers to viewers. Internet users of today are demanding faster, more efficient, and more secure access to content without being concerned with where that content might be located. Networks are also used in many environments where the traditional TCP/IP communication model doesn't fit. The Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor networks are environments where the source-destination communication model doesn't always provide the best solution. CCN was designed to work in many environments from high-speed data centers to resource constrained sensors. CCN aims to be: * Secure - The CCN communication model secures data and not the communication pipe between two specific end-hosts. However, ubiquitous content caching and absence of secure communication pipe between end hosts introduces the challenge to content protection against the unauthorized access, which requires extra care and solutions. * Flexible - CCN uses names to communicate. Names can be location independent and are much more adaptable than IP addresses. Network elements can make more advanced choices based on the named requests and data. * Scalable - CCN enables the network to scale by allowing caching, enabling native multicast traffic, providing native load balancing and facilitating resource planning.  Basic concepts  Content Object messages are named payloads that are the network-sized chunks of data. Names are a hierarchical series of binary name segments that are assigned to Content Objects by content publishers. Signatures are cryptographic bindings between a name, a payload, and the Key Id of the publisher. This is used for provenance. Interest messages are requests for Content Objects that match the name along with some optional restrictions on that object. The core protocol operates as follows: Consumers issue a request for content by sending an Interest message with the name of the desired content. The network routes the interest based on the name using longest prefix match. The interest leaves state as it traverses the network. This state is stored in the Pending Interest Table (PIT). When a match is found (when an Interest matches a Content Object) the content is sent back on the reverse path of the Interest, following the PIT state created by the Interest. Because the content is self identifiable (via the name and the security binding) any Content Object can be cached. Interest messages may be matched against caches along the way, not only at the publishers. Distributed caching within a content-centric network is also possible, requiring multifunctional access parameters across the database. This essentially enables shared network encryption algorithms to employ role-based access limitations to users based on defined authorization levels.  CCNx releases = CCNx 0.x  Interests match Content Objects based on name prefixes. For example, an Interest for /a/b would match a Content Object named /a/b/c/d or /a/b. Interests include restrictions in the form of selectors. These help the network select which of the possible prefix matches are an actual match. For example, an Interest might exclude certain names, ask for a minimum or maximum number of extra name segments, etc. Content Objects have an implicit final name component that is equal to the hash of the Content Object. This may be used for matching to a name. Packet encoding is done using ccnb (a proprietary format based on a type of binary XML). The last version of this branch is 0.8.2 Software is available under a GPL license. Specifications and documentation are also available.  CCNx 1.x  CCNx 1.x differs from CCNx 0.x in the following ways:Solis, Ignacio (July 2014). \\"CCNx 1.0 Changes from 0.x\\", IETF-90 Proceedings. Toronto, Ontario. Retrieved 1 August 2014. Interests match Content Objects on exact names, not name prefixes. Therefore, an Interest for /a/b/ will only match a Content Object with the name /a/b. Interests can restrict matches on the publisher KeyID or the object's ContentObjectHash. A nested Type-Length-Value (TLV) format is used to encode all messages on the wire.

In the centre is climbing route 6, \\"Versuch\\" The Schwedenturm (\\"Sweden Tower\\") in East Germany is a 35-metre- high rock formation made of sandstone in the hills of Saxon Switzerland near the spa town of Rathen and the famous Bastei rocks. From the car park for the Bastei, a path runs towards Schwedenl√∂cher. The Schwedenturm is situated on the right just before the entrance to a narrow ravine. Because it lies in the Saxon Switzerland Climbing Region the free-standing pinnacle may be used for climbing. Currently there are 14 different routes up the rock. It was here that the first grade Xb route in the mountain range was successfully climbed, route 6 (Versuch), by Bernd Arnold. The Schwedenturm was first climbed in 1905 by Rudolf Fehrmann and his brother Arymund.

The regiment was one of only a handful of Missouri regiments to be officially named as well as numbered. The regiment was raised under the authority of Major General John C. Fr√©mont, commander of the Western Department of the U.S. Army, headquartered at St. Louis, Missouri. The regiment was organized by Captain Lewis Merrill, a regular Army officer and a veteran of the prewar U.S. 2nd Dragoons. Serving as a Colonel of Volunteers, Merrill organized companies of volunteers from Missouri and other western states at St. Louis's Benton Barracks. Merrill enforced a level of discipline unusual for volunteer regiments, demanding a level of professionalism comparable to U.S. Regulars. To distinguish the troops of his regiment, Merrill mandated a unique uniform. The front of the tunic featured a \\"horse- head\\" panel trimmed in cavalry yellow. The mandated cap was similarly unique: a sky-blue forage cap, with an orange welt (the branch color of pre-war Dragoon regiments) in honor of Merrill's service in the 2nd Dragoons. As with other areas of military discipline, Merrill allowed no deviation from his orders to his troopers in concerning their military appearance: \\"all additions to or alterations of this uniform as prescribed are positively prohibited and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\\" Through most of 1862, Merrill's Horse was assigned the difficult mission of fighting guerrillas and irregular Confederate cavalry in north Missouri. Often operating with Federal Missouri State Militia cavalry, the regiment established a reputation of extreme aggressiveness and effectiveness in the counter-guerrilla mission. Later in the war Merrill's Horse would provide distinguished service in more conventional cavalry missions against regular Confederate units. However, in Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama the regiment was repeatedly called on to return to the difficult specialist counterinsurgency mission of guerrilla fighting. The regiment is unusual in that it has two official designation. It was officially raised as \\"Merrill's Horse\\", and is usually referred to by that designation in period U.S. Army Records. However, after General Fremont was replaced as commander of the Western Department by Major General Henry Halleck received a second official designation at the 2nd Missouri Volunteer Cavalry.This was the result of legal difficulties caused by Fremont's personal signing of officer's commissions during his tenure. Under the U.S. Constitution, only the President of the United States, state governors, or designated representatives may commission officers (Lincoln had specifically declined to delegate such authority to Fremont). Halleck solved this potential legal problem by requesting Provisional Governor of Missouri Hamilton Gamble to provide retroactive new commissions for all such officers, as Missouri Volunteer troops in U.S. service. Merrill's Horse was provided with its alternative designation as part of this process. The Missouri State \\"Veterans'\\" color awarded to the regiment in 1864 featured both names. However, in almost all contemporary reports and records the regiment continued to be referred to as Merrill's Horse. Service Organized at Benton Barracks, St. Louis, Missouri, by Captain Lewis Merrill, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, U.S.A., under authority of Major General John C. Fr√©mont, commander of the U.S. Army's Department of the West. Merrill organized his regiment from September 3 to December 11, 1861.

It was painted for the church in 1484, commissioned by bishop Jacopo Vagnucci, a native of Cortona, Signorelli's birthplace. Description The scene portrayed is a Holy Conversation, with a high throne where the Virgin and Child sit, placed over a Classical-style pedestal and crowned by a small engraved arch featuring a festoon with vegetables. Mary is reading a Bible, while Jesus holds a white lily, symbolizing her virginity and purity. Over a gilded step are St. John the Baptist and St. Lawrence, surmounted by two flying angels. On the marble step below, Signorelli portrayed a sitting angel playing a lute, perhaps a homage to elements typical of the contemporary Venetian school (such as the San Cassiano Altarpiece by Antonello da Messina). The angel resembles one painted by Signorelli in the Basilica della Santa Casa, at Loreto, a few years earlier. Standing on the foreground pavement are St. Onuphrius and St. Herculanus, the patrons of Perugia. Influences in the style of the painting include Ercole de' Roberti's Santa Maria di Porto Altarpiece, Donatello and Filippo Lippi (in the fierce figure of Lawrence) and, in the figure of Herculanus, that of Piero della Francesca's St. Augustine.
